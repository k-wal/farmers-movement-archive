Visiting an RTO can be an onerous task for vehicle owners, who have to walk through the maze of red-tape, delays and touts to get simple tasks done. Frustrated, tech-savvy citizens are venting their anger by rating RTOs, on the lines of rating restaurants.  The more the alleged corruption and official apathy, the fewer the stars. Though department bigwigs claim people can get issues addressed online and do not have to visit offices in person, the reality is different: Online applicants are compelled to visit offices to ‘clear’ doubts raised by officials. For instance, Koramangala RTO has 1,156 reviews. Kishor Kanyal, a netizen wrote last week: “This place has lots of middlemen; without them it seems impossible to do any job related to driving licence. Minimum you have to pay is Rs 8000... Horrible.” Waseem Memon of Drive Without Borders, an NGO, said: “More and more people are reviewing RTOs, but there has been no response from officials. In private establishments like restaurants, the person concerned responds to the feedback. For transport officials, there is no accountability.” He added: “A board with contact details of the Lokayukta should be displayed at RTOs so that a person can complain if anyone demands bribe. In Telangana, it has been done.” Gurudatt Sheshadri, who reviewed Rajajinagar RTO, wrote: “Things need to improve. The information desk seems missing. Information given will not in one shot, you will have to run around counters and answer the same questions repeatedly (sic).” Officials, however, have a different explanation. “There are various factors at play — there is so much pressure from the top that the common man ends up bearing the brunt,” said an official. Transport commissioner N Shivakumar was unavailable for comments. An official said they have set up help desks at all RTOs. “We will take action against touts and errant staff based on the complaints,” the official added. Social media expert Tinu Cherian opined: “Government agencies could treat these reviews as a public feedback mechanism to improve their services.” ‘They want extra money’Mohan Kumar wrote a review on Kasturi Nagar RTO. It reads “...They are not at all ashamed of taking 100 or 200 or 500 rupees extra money for the service it is supposed to be free. If you are not paying that extra they have 100 reasons to reject and send you back. They will never guide and help you to follow the procedures instead they will make you pay that extra then no process or procedure to be followed (sic).” When it comes to Yeshwantpur RTO, many complained about inadequate parking facilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/vehicle-owners-rate-rtos-online-many-allege-graft/articleshow/86019545.cms||Christin Mathew Philip
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Police use stringent law to check drug mafia; 5 booked||BENGALURU: In a bid to check drug peddling, cops are booking repeat offenders under Prevention of Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, under which the suspect has to remain in judicial custody for at least one year without bail. Five such offenders were booked in and around Bengaluru this year. Police commissioner Kamal Pant said: “PIT NDPS Act can be invoked against habitual drug peddlers booked thrice in the past on the charge. This is another important legal tool in our war against drug mafia.” Of the five accused, three were booked in the city. They include two Nigerian nationals — Nanso Joachhin, 37, of Horamavu and Makuko Chukwuka Muolokwu, 32, of Kogilu Cross — booked by Central Crime Branch sleuths in the past two months. KG Halli police invoked the Act against Syed Nazeem, 41, of Pillanna Garden. All three were booked on drug-peddling charges at least three times in the recent past. In Bengaluru Rural, Sarjapur police booked a 31-year-old rowdy-sheeter A Wasim Akram Khan under the Act. He faces over 10 criminal cases, including four of drug peddling registered in recent years. The fifth accused was booked in Chikkaballapura. Joint commissioner of police (crime) Sandeep Patil said: “For some time, we have been collecting antecedents of almost all drug peddlers in and around the city. We identify those who have been booked more than three times, prepare a report justifying invocation of PIT NDPS Act against the particular suspect and an order is issued by the police commissioner. It is to be approved by the high court advisory board. Once nod is granted, the peddler has to remain in custody for an entire year,” he explained. ‘Financial probe’Inspector general of police (central range) M Chandrasekhar opines that carrying out ‘financial investigation’ against the drug peddler is also an effective legal tool. “Recently, we seized properties worth over Rs 1.7 crore belonging to an alleged drug peddler by invoking financial investigation defined under chapter V of NDPS Act,1985. We should submit a strong chargesheet explaining to the court that the 54-year-old accused amassed the property through money he earned by drug peddling,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/police-use-stringent-law-tocheck-drug-mafia-5-booked/articleshow/86019584.cms||Rajiv Kalkod
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Two denied bail in cryptocurrency case||BENGALURU: Two persons, who were arrested for allegedly cheating a businessman of Rs 3.5 crore on the pretext of helping him invest in cryptocurrency business, have been denied bail by a city civil and session court. While applying for bail, Piyushbhai Himmatlal Soni and Rajeshbhai Dhirajlal Soni from Gujarat had maintained that cryptocurrency transactions were not regulated by Reserve Bank of India or the law of the land. South CEN Crime police had arrested them a month ago. The main suspect, Kunal Anup Chandrana, is still at large. A local court had dismissed Chandrana’s anticipatory bail plea on August 10. Businessman Gowtham, 37, of JP Nagar, filed a complaint on June 28. After his friend, Ramesh TV, made profit, he took interest in the business. Stating that he has little knowledge in the sector, Ramesh asked him to contact his friend Chandrana who claimed to be an expert. On May 15, Gowtham transferred Rs 3.5 crore to two bank accounts provided by Chandrana. But Chandrana neither arranged cryptocurrency nor returned the money. Police gathered details of the bank accounts and traced Piyushbhai and Rajeshbhai. Claiming innocence, the duo said they are in the business of buying and selling of agricultural products and equipment. The prosecution filed an objection, seeking cancellation of bail to prevent them from influencing witnesses and the victim. The prosecution said police have requested banks to freeze accounts of the accused and the persons who have had transactions with them. Based on this, all the accounts amounting to Rs 3.3 crore have been seized.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/two-denied-bail-in-cryptocurrency-case/articleshow/86019618.cms||Santosh kumar.B
---||World||Biden to lay out plan to fight Delta variant: W House||WASHINGTON: United States President Joe Biden on Thursday will outline plans to combat the highly transmissible Delta variant of the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19, as he attempts to recover rapidly slipping political momentum. A White House official said Tuesday that Biden will "speak to the American people about his robust plan to stop the spread of the Delta variant and boost vaccinations". The "six-pronged strategy" will involve both the public and private sectors, the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said. "As the president has said since day one, his administration will pull every lever to get the pandemic under control," the official said. Biden, who took office in January, won praise for his administration's concerted effort to get the coronavirus pandemic under control. Mass vaccination campaigns quickly got off the ground, boosting the Democrat's image as a competent crisis manager. However, the combination of the aggressive Delta variant and large, mostly the Republican-dominated swaths of the country where vaccinations continue to lag, has fueled a stunning resurgence of the disease. Despite the role played by the Republican leaders in refusing to impose mask mandates in hard-hit areas, Biden is taking much of the blame. Also damaged politically by the traumatic exit from Afghanistan, the 78-year-old Democrat has seen his political fortunes plummet in the last few weeks. In the latest Washington Post-ABC News poll, 52% approved of Biden's handling of the pandemic, down from 62% of adults in June. Biden's overall approval average ratings are firmly below 50% for the first time in his presidency. According to the Washington Post-ABC News survey, only 44% approve of his performance, compared to 50% in June.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-to-lay-out-plan-to-fight-delta-variant-w-house/articleshow/86011492.cms||---
---||Guwahati||Assam: Most mobile theatre groups not to stage shows for 1 more year||GUWAHATI: Faced with an uncertain future in view of the prevailing Covid-19 in the state, 30 out of 35 mobile theatre groups have decided not to stage plays for another year despite the health department’s nod to begin rehearsals. Tapan Lahkar, producer of Kohinoor theatre and member of All Assam Mobile Theatre Association, said, “The SOP has granted permission for rehearsals only. The government is yet to grant permission for shows among the public.” “Rehearsals will entail an investment of Rs 30 lakh. We are uncertain about getting our investment back adhering to Covid-19 protocols,” he said. A total of 21 mobile theatre groups are under the association while 14 are not. Four theatre groups registered under the association — Abahan, Itihax, Bhagyadebi and Nayantora, and one theatre group outside the association — Udayan have decided to take a chance, banking on the government allowing fully vaccinated people to attend the shows. Major theatre groups including, Kohinoor have decided to remain shut for another year. “We have already survived more than a year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. We do not want to take risks by going for shows. It would be better to wait for another year and go for shows in 2022-23 after complete normalcy returns,” Lahkar said. He said cinema halls or multiplexes can be resumed with limited seat capacity as they function inside a closed hall. “But it is not possible for the theatre groups and the committees, who invite a group for show, to control the seating capacity adhering to Covid-19 protocols,” Lahkar said. Usually, the pre-production work of mobile theatre groups begin in May and June. Rehearsals of the plays start in July and the groups finally go for shows from September and the journey ends in April next year. The budget of a mobile theatre group for a year ranges from Rs 2.5 crore to Rs 3 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/most-mobile-theatre-groups-not-to-stage-shows-for-1-more-yr/articleshow/86020802.cms||Mukut Das

BKS had sent a memorandum of demands to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on August 11. Unfortunately, we have not got any response from the Prime Minister in the matter. Therefore, we have decided to hold the protest. Further courses of action will be decided on the basis of the stand of the central government on the demands.” Bora said that a quintal of rice is being sold at around Rs 1,100 in the state, which is much below the rate fixed by the Centre. “Farmers should get fair prices for their produce,” he added. “We would like to urge the government to take stringent action against the people involved in the fertilizer syndicate,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/farmers-body-threatens-stir-over-msp/articleshow/86020801.cms||---
---||World||Texas governor signs controversial voting-access bill||WASHINGTON: Republican Texas governor Greg Abbott signed the state's controversial election integrity bill on Tuesday after a months-long battle with Democrats who say it restricts the voting rights of minorities. Senate Bill 1, which supporters argue makes elections safer by protecting against voter fraud, prohibits drive-in voting and institutes several other restrictions on voting hours and mail-in voting. "It does make it easier for people to be able to go vote," Abbott said at the signing in the city of Tyler, in northeast Texas. "No one who is eligible to vote will be denied the opportunity to vote. It does, however, make it harder for cheaters to cast an illegal ballot." Abbott's signature followed a protracted battle that saw 50 Democratic lawmakers flee Texas in a desperate attempt to deny the Republicans the minimum number of present representatives required to vote. The move comes with supporters of former US president Donald Trump still alleging without evidence that widespread voter fraud occurred in the 2020 election that he lost. President Joe Biden called an earlier formulation of the legislation "an assault on democracy" that would disproportionately affect voters of colour. Since January, at least 18 American states have adopted laws restricting voting and around a dozen others are under consideration, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. The local Latino community, unionists and retirees have already filed lawsuits against the legislation, and a move is underway in Congress to pass voter protections under the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, which would supersede the Texas law. "Texas is one of the most difficult states in the country to vote in. Today, gov. Greg Abbott signed a bill into law that will make it even harder for eligible Texans to exercise their freedom to vote," Texas House Democratic Caucus chair Chris Turner said in a statement. "Senate Bill 1 will go into effect on December 3. With the deliberate barriers to voting created by this legislation and redistricting just around the corner, we need the US Senate to act immediately on the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. Our democracy depends on it."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/texas-governor-signs-controversial-voting-access-bill/articleshow/86015823.cms||---
---||World||Taliban’s Akhund to be acting PM, Baradar his deputy||ISLAMABAD: The Taliban announced on Tuesday a 33-member team for an interim government that will be headed Mullah Mohammad Hasan Akhund, one of the movement’s founding members who had also been foreign minister and then deputy prime minister in the group’s previous 1996-2001 regime. The group’s co-founder, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, whose negotiations with the US led finally to the latter’s pullout from Afghanistan, will be his deputy. Akhund, now acting PM, has been the head of the Taliban’s Rehbari Shura, or leadership council, for about two decades. Baradar, or brother, a fighting name bestowed on him by the late Taliban founder Mullah Omar, whom many expected would lead the Taliban government this time, had been deputy defence minister in the group’s last stint in power and had served prison time in Pakistan, the latter distinction possibly costing him the top job. Read AlsoNo non-Taliban minister, Baradar 'demoted': Key takeaways from new Afghanistan governmentNEW DELHI: Afghanistan's wait for a new government ended on Tuesday with the Taliban announcing a caretaker cabinet to govern the country. The new government announcement comes seven days after the last American troops left Afghanistan on August 31. Mullah Hasan Akhund, an associate of theAfghan crisis: Live updatesTaliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid, announcing the interim appointments at a press conference, declared the country would now be called the "Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan". All 33 members were picked up from the group; not a single non-Talib has been included. "Afghanistan has gained freedom and only the will of Afghans will be applicable in the country. After today, no one will be able to interfere in Afghanistan," the Taliban spokesman vowed. Read AlsoKey figures in the new Taliban governmentNEW DELHI: The Taliban on Tuesday evening announced the new government. Mullah Hasan Akhund will be the acting Prime Minister in the new government while Mullah Baradar will be his first deputy. Following are some of the key figures in the new government that will take charge in Kabul: MullahSirajuddin Haqqani, son of Jalalauddin Haqqani, the founder of the Haqqani network, designated a foreign terrorist organisation by the US, has been appointed acting interior minister, while Mullah Mohammad Yaqoob, son of the slain Taliban founder Mullah Omar, has been named as the defence minister. Yaqoob had attempted to take his father’s place and had to be placated when he did not succeed. Hidayatullah Badri will be the acting minister of finance. Amir Khan Muttaqi has been made acting foreign minister and Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai will serve as his deputy. Zabhiullah Mujahid, the man without a face photographed only after the fall of Kabul recently, has been given charge of the information ministry, and Fasihuddin Badakhshani has been named army chief. The spokesman did not mention any role in government for the Taliban chief, Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada, He has not been seen or heard in public for almost two years, including after the collapse of the Western-backed government and the takeover of Kabul by the Taliban in August. In June this year, there were media reports that he had died due to Covid-19, but the Taliban had denied it. On Monday, Mujahid had said that Akhunzada would appear soon. Many of the names announced by Mujahid were old faces, the majority of them Pashtuns. Despite claims that the government would be inclusive, they did not take into consideration members from other ethnic groups. Women are not part of the caretaker setup. When asked why, Ahmadullah Wasiq, member of the Taliban cultural commission, said the cabinet had not been finalised yet. Observers believe the announcement of the acting government by the Taliban has not paved the way for the international community to give them recognition. "The amount of time spent wasn’t on discussing or negotiating inclusivity or potential power-sharing with other political parties. That time was spent on knowing how to split that pie amongst their own ranks," Obaidullah Baheer of the American University of Afghanistan told media from Kabul. Meanwhile, acting PM Hasan Akhund congratulated Afghans on the "withdrawal of all foreign forces, the end of the occupation and complete liberation of the country". He said that the leaders would "work hard towards upholding Islamic rules and Sharia (Islamic law) in the country, protecting the country’s highest interests, securing Afghanistan’s borders, and ensuring lasting peace, prosperity and development". All governance and life in the country will henceforth be in accordance with Islamic law, Akhund said. He added that the Taliban wanted strong and healthy relations with all countries based on mutual respect. "We are committed to all international laws and treaties, resolutions and commitments that are not in conflict with Islamic law and the country’s national values," the new Afghan ruler stressed. He also emphasised that the interim government would take "serious and effective steps" to protect human rights as well as the rights of minorities and underprivileged groups within the framework of the demands of Islam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/talibans-akhund-to-be-acting-pm-baradar-his-deputy/articleshow/86020048.cms||---

"Mobile internet will be open in Srinagar & Budgam today by 7pm," IGP Vijay Kumar announced earlier in the day. He expressed regret at the inconvenience caused to students by the sudden suspension of internet services. The authorities had resumed internet in the remaining districts of the Valley on Monday. Amid criticism and controversy over yet another internet blackout, DGP Dilbag Singh complimented security forces for "handling the ground situation during the last five days in Kashmir" and the local population, especially youth, for their "responsible conduct". "We have to move forward together to strengthen peace by identifying the enemies of peace and weaning out the mischievous elements, strictly dealing with them under the law," J&K police tweeted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/internet-back-in-srinagar-budgam/articleshow/86020282.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||World||Afghans protest meddling by Pakistan, call Taliban its ‘puppets’||ISLAMABAD: Taliban fighters resorted to discharging their guns in the air to disperse protesters, including women, at a large demonstration in front of the Pakistan embassy in Kabul on Tuesday. Chanting anti-Pakistan slogans, hundreds of people took to the streets in Afghanistan’s national capital to demand women’s rights and denounce Taliban rule, amid fears that the armed group would impose strict Islamic rule after formally announcing their government. Blaming Pakistan for the Taliban’s return to power, the protesters chanted anti-Pakistan slogans like "Death to Pakistan", "Freedom, freedom" and "Taliban are Pakistani puppets". One of the placards read "Pakistan, Pakistan, Leave Afghanistan". Some of the women were carrying placards with messages that said "We want political participation at all levels" and decried the gender segregation introduced by the Taliban in colleges and universities. Several demonstrators said that Taliban fighters with cameras and cell phones were taking close-up shots of Kabul protesters. "We fear that we will face retribution for exercising our right to protest peacefully," a woman protester said outside Pakistan’s embassy. The Taliban stopped journalists from covering the event and arrested some local mediapersons and confiscated their equipment. Afghanistan’s TOLOnews confirmed that its cameraman Wahid Ahmady was arrested for filming the protest. The protest was organised by a group of women and soon they were joined by hundreds of men. According to observers, there had been no men at previous women-led rallies. Dispersing the protesters by shooting in the air came days after the group had banned such protests since 17 people were killed and 47 injured in celebratory firing in Kabul. Videos shared on social media showed people running to safety while heavy gunfire could be heard in the background. Afghan women have been protesting across the country now for over a week, demanding respect for their rights, including civil liberties and inclusion in the future government. Several protests have taken place in Kabul, Herat, Mazar-e-Sharif, Zaranj and other parts of the country. On Saturday, the Taliban had violently suppressed one such protest in Kabul, prompting the group’s spokesman to claim that they had detained four men who had allegedly struck women at that demonstration. These daily protests appear to be desperate attempts to win assurances from the Taliban that they will not return to their harsh regime of the past and that they will allow people to live the lives they have led over the past 20 years. Observers say that the Taliban’s actions are closely watched and monitored from abroad, with Western governments signalling that the resumption of most aid will be contingent on whether Afghanistan’s new rulers respect basic human rights. While Taliban leaders have time and again pledged to govern more moderately, and that women will be allowed to work, many remain deeply sceptical of their promises. Across Afghanistan, a generation of girls have grown up in an environment completely different from the one their parents knew. During the past Taliban regime, when it ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001, the militants had banned girls from school and women from the workplace.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/afghans-protest-meddling-by-pakistan-call-taliban-its-puppets/articleshow/86020412.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

A joint statement issued by Pradyot and AJP president Lurinjyoti Gogoi here states, “The Assam Jatiya Parishad and the Tripaha Indigenous Progressive Regional Alliance (TIPRA) have decided to join hands and begin a political alliance in this direction.” “Today, the Assam Jatiya Parishad and the Indigenous Progressive Regional Alliance (TIPRA) have decided to join hands towards political cooperation and begin an initiative to form a united forum of all regional political parties of the northeastern region towards a regional political movement. A final decision in this regard will be announced soon after having dialogues with all regional political parties of northeastern states,” the statement said. The immediate demands of the two parties are repeal of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, complete the National Register of Citizens (NRC) update, immediate constitutional provisions for protection of identity and culture of the all indigenous people of Tripura, including the Tripuris and acceptance of the demand of Tipraland/Greater Tripraland in writing and implementation of the Assam Accord in totality, of the recommendations on Clause VI of the Assam Accord submitted by the high-level committee to provide constitutional safeguard to the Assamese people and to protect the language, literature and the political rights of the Assamese people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/pradyot-lurinjyoti-team-up-to-take-on-bjps-neda/articleshow/86020526.cms||Prabin Kalita

ADGP (Jammu Zone) Mukesh Singh said the trio was tasked with carrying out terror activities in Poonch. He said that security forces, based on specific inputs, apprehended one Jahangir Ali of Poonch and during a search of his bag, two pistols, four Chinese grenades, 100 pistol rounds and four pistol magazines were recovered. “During the investigation, it was found that the accused was to hand over the consignment to Basharat Khan and Sheraz of Sangla, both from Surankote in Poonch district. The duo was subsequently arrested by conducting simultaneous raids at different places,” ADGP Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/terror-module-busted-in-poonch-three-arrested-with-arms-ammo/articleshow/86020544.cms||Sanjay Khajuria
---||Guwahati||40% of Guwahati Covid cases spreading from districts: Admin||GUWAHATI: Those who are not residents of the city are emerging to be the biggest carriers of the infection right now because 40% of the daily positive cases are from this group, who are getting detected while being treated in hospitals here. But the positivity rate has dipped remarkably at the airport and in railway stations. However, markets are still being seen as super-spreaders in residential colonies, especially in East Guwahati. The Kamrup (Metro) administration and the health department are continuing their surveillance among the floating population, including traders and other workers, who are not residents of the city. “The floating population does not have a permanent address in Guwahati. The maximum positive cases are now being detected at the Gauhati Medical College Hospital (GMCH) and some leading private hospitals. They are being tested before consultation with doctors,” additional DC, Sharmistha Borah, told TOI on Tuesday. She confirmed that 30 to 40% of the daily cases detected in Kamrup (Metro) are being reported from the hospitals. Borah said while some of the cases are being reported from targeted testing that is being carried out randomly among the street vendors and vulnerable population on footpaths, detection of cases in the residential colonies, especially East Guwahati, is a bigger threat. “For quite a while, we have been registering most cases from Beltola, Six Mile and Khanapara areas in East Guwahati. This is a vast area and has some old markets,” she added. In these areas, mostly women were found positive because they go to the markets, said Borah. Earlier truck parkings, warehouses and defence establishments in East Guwahati were in the radar but of late the market places have emerged as spreaders. Health officials said there is no community spread reported recently, though in some of the apartments and densely populated pockets, more people have turned positive. “Interestingly, medical staff who reside in rented houses have also become carriers of the virus,” said Borah. Out of the 636 Covid cases detected in the state on Monday, 124 were from Kamrup (Metro). Second in the tally was Sivasagar district in upper Assam but the case number was only 49. In Baksa, Bongaigaon, Charaideo, Chirang, Dhubri, Dima Hasao, Goalpara, Hailakandi, Karbi Anglong, Kokrajhar, Majuli, South Salmara and Udalguri districts less than 10 cases were detected on Monday. Assam director of medical education, Dr Anup Kumar Barman, said 30% of the floating population in Guwahati, who hails from other districts, is the major worry. “In railway stations and at the Guwahati airport, the detection of new cases has significantly declined. Thus, people coming from other states are no more a big concern,” Barman said. “The trend in Guwahati shows that cases are not increasing but it is also not going down like most districts,” he added. In GMCH here, the rate of new admission of Covid cases has come down compared to the peak days of the second wave. However, the severity of infection still persists. “On the GMCH campus, a total of 278 Covid cases were admitted as on Tuesday. Forty of them are in critical care in ICU, which shows the severity of the virus infection,” GMCH principal, Dr Achyut Baishya, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/40-of-guwahati-cov-cases-spreading-from-dists-admin/articleshow/86020600.cms||---
---||Guwahati||Guwahati: Cotton University begins admission process, offers 25% more seats||GUWAHATI: Cotton University (CU) on Tuesday opened its online portal for receiving admission forms for undergraduate (UG) courses with a 25% increase in intake capacity to address a possible seat crisis. CU academic registrar Sanjay Dutta said the 25% seats have been reserved for Assam state board passouts amid a crisis of seats due to high pass percentage in class XII boards this year. At the same time, the leading state university has decided to enrol students from the economically weaker sections (EWS) in 10% seats for the first time. Admission process has kicked off in CU after a prolonged delay, but the university authority said the entire process may conclude by September. “We will continue to receive online forms for all undergraduate courses in science and arts till September 16. It has been decided to increase seats by 25% so that meritorious students from the state board are not deprived,” Dutta told TOI. Lack of clarity on the controversial 75:25 reservation of seats in UG courses for state board and CBSE passouts persists in Assam as most of the educational institutions have not yet received a revised order. While an earlier order passed by the state higher education directorate in August had asked colleges and state universities to reserve 75% seats for state board students, education minister Ranoj Pegu later announced that the board-based reservation won’t be applicable in urban areas. Officials in CU said in the rest of the seats, apart from the 25% increase, admission will be purely on the basis of merit and as per the performance reflected in the mark sheets. Instructions on the EWS quota came from the state government last year itself, but the policy could not be followed as the admission process was already over when the CU received the directive. Admissions will now be held in about 1,250 UG seats (BA and BSc Honours, BCA and BA -Liberal Arts) after the 25% additional seats have been earmarked. “The merit list is expected by September 22, whereas the admissions are likely to be held in the last week of this month,” said Dutta. Last year too, 25% seats in all colleges of Assam at the degree level were increased because of the pandemic since many students could not go outside the state for higher studies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/cotton-univ-begins-admission-process-offers-25-more-seats/articleshow/86020639.cms||---

The notification issued by the road transport and highways ministry this week for National Road Safety Board (NRSB) is aimed at putting integrated efforts in collaboration with states to reduce road crashes and improve all aspects of safety. The provision for establishing the Board with experts from different fields was provisioned in the Motor Vehicle Amendment Act of 2019. Several countries across the world including the United States, Sweden and Australia have lead agencies at national level. The proposal for an apex Board at the national level was first mooted in 2007 in the Sundar Committee report. The panel was formed to present a note to the Empowered Committee of Secretaries for the creation of a Directorate of Road Safety and Traffic Management and required the amendment of traffic laws as required. In January 2005, the Cabinet Committee on Infrastructure headed by then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had directed the road transport ministry to present a note prepared by a specialised panel. According to the notification, the Board will have a chairman, members and technical committees under experts to deal with different aspects of road safety including vehicle engineering, data collection and crash investigation. The Board will have officials from the road transport ministry and state governments who will be the ex-officio members. The chairman and members will be appointed by the Central government after recommendation by a search-cum-selection committee under the chairmanship of the Union road transport secretary. Such persons must have special knowledge of or professional experience in administration, road safety, urban planning, law, traffic management and regulation, health and advocacy, enforcement and investigation, transport engineering, insurance, automobile engineering, civil engineering and public transport. The Sundar committee had recommended that the broad-based selection committee comprising the Cabinet Secretary and secretary from road transport and DGs of health services and CSIR should draw up a panel from which the appointments would be made. “A broad-based selection committee and a transparent selection process are necessary to ensure that the best talent available both from within the government and the market is recruited,” it had said. The transport ministry’s notification specifies that the Board will have the advisory role to put recommendations and proposals for the Central government, which include formulation of specific standards for road safety, traffic management and road construction for hilly regions in the country. It can also provide technical advice and assistance to the Central and state governments and local authorities on administration of road safety and traffic management. The Board can also specify guidelines for establishing and operating trauma facilities and paramedical facilities for dealing with traffic related injuries on roads. Welcoming the notification, Dr H S Chhabra, president of Spinal Cord Society said, “The constitution of National Road Safety Board, which will function as the lead agency at national level to deal with matters relating to road safety, is a very welcome and long awaited step. It is heartening that the notification came on the sixth day of the Injury Prevention Week which was commemorated for the first time from September 1-7. Experts have always demanded the need for an integrated multi-sectoral approach at Centre and state level with a nodal agency with appropriate authority and budget.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/india-gets-lead-agency-for-road-safety-govt-notifies-board-at-national-level/articleshow/86020857.cms||Dipak K Dash

GOI expresses concern for the rights of Afghan people but willfully denies the same to Kashmiris. I have been placed under house arrest today because according to admin the situation is far from normal in Kashmir. This exposes their fake claims of normalcy,” Mehbooba tweeted.

---||India||ISI ‘stooge’ Masarat Alam Bhat named new Hurriyat chairman||SRINAGAR: Barely a week after former Hurriyat chief Syed Ali Shah Geelani's death, the separatist All Parties Hurriyat Conference on Tuesday handed the reins of the organisation to Masarat Alam Bhat, an alleged ISI stooge who once had 27 criminal cases against his name. Bhat, accused of fomenting the 2010 street violence in which nearly 120 people were killed in J&K, had been arrested twice, the second time under the Public Safety Act. His release from jail in March 2015 after the late Mufti Mohammad Sayeed become CM with BJP's support had triggered a controversy that echoed even in Parliament. He was soon taken into custody again. The Pakistan-based Kashmir Media Service announced Bhat's appointment along with jailed Shabbir Ahmad Shah and Ghulam Ahmad Gulzar as vice-chairmen. Separatist leader Moulvi Bashir Ahmad Irfani will continue as general secretary of the amalgam, it said. The agency, known to be an ISI mouthpiece, also issued a "protest calendar" over J&K police "showing disrespect to the dead body of Geelani". On Tuesday, the police released a video on social media showing Geelani's funeral at a graveyard near his home in Srinagar's Hyderpora. In a series of tweets late Monday, the police said senior officials had merely requested the two sons of the deceased to bury their father in a Srinagar graveyard in the middle of the night, away from public attention, to avoid any potential law and order problem. "After death of SAS Geelani, IGP Kashmir Vijay Kumar along with SP & ASP met both of his sons at their residence at 11pm, condoled them & requested for burial in the night for larger interest of general public due to potential major Law and order situations. Both agreed and asked to wait for two hours until relatives reach," the police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/isis-pick-handed-hurriyat-reins/articleshow/86021012.cms||M Saleem Pandit
---||India||Pak does it again: Appoints non-Sikh as CEO of Kartapur Corridor unit||AMRITSAR: Despite objections by India over hand-over of the management and maintenance of Gurdwara Darbar Sahib, Kartarpur Sahib, to a non-Sikh body, the Pakistan government has again appointed a non-Sikh person as the new chief executive officer (CEO) of the Project Management Unit (PMU), formed exclusively for running the day-to-day affairs of Kartapur Corridor.  Pakistan’s Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB), a department created in 1960 to look after the properties left by Sikhs and Hindus during India-Pakistan partition in 1947, had on September 3 appointed Mohammed Latif as its new CEO, replacing Mohammad Tariq Khan.  The first reaction came from Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) whose president Manjinder Singh Sirsa had censured the Imran Khan government of Pakistan for sending a wrong message to the minority Sikh community of the country. “Pak government has sent a message to the Sikh micro-minority community that the decisions pertaining to their religious affairs and places would be taken by the majority community,” he said, demanding that only a Sikh should head the PMU.  Sirsa said the DSGMC would also write to the Indian government seeking its intervention for pressing Pakistan to appoint a Sikh as the CEO of the PMU.  Notably, in November 2019, Pakistan government had approved the establishment of PMU of Kartarpur Corridor, and a few days later a nine-member team, led by Tariq Khan, was constituted.  India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) had then lodged a strong protest, stating that such action had exposed the Pakistan government’s and its leadership’s tall claims of preserving and protecting the rights and welfare of the religious minority communities.  In an official statement, the MEA had stated that “Pakistan government is called upon to reverse its arbitrary decision to deprive the Sikh minority community its right to manage affairs of the holy Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib”.  Despite repeated attempts, chairman of ETPB, Dr Aamir Ahamd, didn’t respond to the phone call and message by TOI, seeing his reaction to the development and Indian Sikh body’s objection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pak-does-it-again-appoints-non-sikh-as-ceo-of-kartapur-corridor-unit/articleshow/86020832.cms||Yudhvir Rana
---||Business||Cairn ready to settle India dispute, take $1 billion refund||NEW DELHI: Cairn Energy Plc has said it is looking to settle its decade-long tax dispute with the Indian government following the recent amendments to the retrospective tax law. “The expected near-term resolution of the India tax dispute would result in a refund to Cairn by the Government of India of Rs 7,900 crore (approximately $1.06bn). In accepting the terms of the new legislation in India, Cairn would be required to withdraw its international arbitration award claim, interest and costs and to end all legal enforcement actions in order to be eligible for the refund,” the company said in a filing to the London Stock Exchange, while offering to pay up to $700 million to its shareholders. Top Crain executives have been talking to the government for the last few weeks. Cairn may be the first among the 17 cases to be resolved and requires the government to refund tax that had been collected from the British company. “Once we get to final resolution, part of that resolution is us dropping everything in terms of litigation. We can do that within a very short period of time, just a matter of a couple of days or something... So, we are preparing on the basis of getting this resolution quickly, all these cases being dropped, and putting all this behind,” Cairn CEO Simon Thomson told a news agency on Tuesday. The company’s director David Nesbit, who was in Delhi, said Cairn Energy would drop its demand for damages to be paid, which was part of an award by an international tribunal. “We obviously have to forgo that. We have got to be pragmatic about it,” Nesbit said. As part of the amendments moved by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, the government had made it a pre-condition for companies to drop all litigation and penalty and interest claims. Nesbit also complimented the government for being “very bold, transparent and open” about the process, which required amendments to reverse a decision during Pranab Mukherjee’s term as finance minister in the Manmohan Singh government, which had sought to levy capital gain tax on all transactions with underlying assets in India, even if the companies were not in India. Mukherjee moved the amendments following a setback in the Supreme Court, which had dismissed a claim made by tax authorities on Vodafone after its acquisition of a 67% stake in Hutch Essar through an overseas entity with Hutchison Whampoa also holding interest in the Indian entity through a local company. Following the amendments, Cairn and Vodafone had challenged the decision under bilateral investment protection agreements and got a favourable ruling in international tribunals. The government had challenged both the rulings but came under pressure after Cairn filed cases in France and the US to enforce its claims based on the tribunal award. Sitharaman said the amendments were in line with the Narendra Modi government’s stand, but it was waiting to move then following a “logical conclusion” of the cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/cairn-ready-to-settle-india-dispute-take-1-billion-refund/articleshow/86021436.cms||---
---||India||Collegium returns 18 names to Bombay high court||NEW DELHI: In a major embarrassment for the Bombay high court, both the Centre and the SC collegium have disagreed with the manner in which the HC chose names of 18 advocates for appointment as HC judges during the short tenure of Chief Justice B P Dharmadhikari last year. The names have been sent back for reconsideration. The hasty selection of so many advocates and non-scouting of talents available before the Bombay HC benches at Goa, Aurangabad and Nagpur was flagged by sitting SC judges A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud, who were consultee judges for then collegium headed by then CJI S A Bobde. The decision to ask the HC to reconsider the names is an embarrassment to Justice Bobde who, just a month prior to retirement, sought to push the appointments. If Justice Bobde did not heed to material objections by the two SC judges, who hail from the Bombay HC, it was the Centre that highlighted the merit in their reservations to return all the names for reconsideration to the three-member SC collegium, now headed by CJI N V Ramana, and which includes Justice Khanwilkar. Justice Chandrachud is now part of the five-member SC collegium. The government returned the names on August 12 to the SC collegium, which on August 17 decided to send the names back to Bombay HC for reconsideration. The Union law ministry on September 6 wrote a letter along with the returned names requesting the HC to reconsider their suitability, official sources said. The Bombay HC, during the very short tenure of CJ Dharmadhikari, had recommended 22 names — 18 advocates and four judicial officers — for appointment as judges. The four judicial officers have been appointed as HC judges by the Centre. Both Justices Khanwilkar and Chandrachud had in writing informed CJI Bobde to send all names back to present Bombay HC CJ Dipankar Datta for effective evaluation of merit and maintaining objectivity in the constitutional process for selection of HC judges. Sources said the two judges had felt that Bombay HC, being in the financial capital of the country, required judges with domain knowledge in emerging fields of law and suggested that since Datta has been chief justice for quite some time, he should be asked to reconsider the names. When CJI Bobde had asked Justice Chandrachud to specify objections against individuals, the latter had written an even more stinging response and said when he was suggesting reconsideration of the entire list, to give an opinion on individuals would amount to "cherry picking", the sources said. After less than encouraging views from Justices Khanwilkar and Chandrachud, the CJI had sought the opinion of Justice U U Lalit on the names. With just a little more than a month to go for his retirement, CJI Bobde had felt that the vacancies in the Bombay HC needed to be filled urgently and scheduled the collegium meeting without waiting for the response from Justice Lalit. The meeting found 13 of the 22 suitable for appointment — nine advocates and four judicial officers. Justice Dharmadhikari was acting CJ of Bombay HC from February 20 to March 19 last year. He was CJ from March 20 till his superannuation on April 27, 2020. Justices Khanwilkar and Chandrachud have said it would be well nigh impossible for a chief justice to prepare a list of 22 probable candidates within such a short span. They said shortlisting a candidate requires the HC CJ to watch the performance of the advocates, consult bar leaders and colleague judges about the integrity, ability and capability of each individual. They said most of the recommended persons are in and around 55 years of age and appointing persons of this age group would not be advisable as they would have a short tenure of around six years as HC judges, who retire at the age of 62 years||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/collegium-returns-18-names-to-bombay-high-court/articleshow/86021656.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Here's a look at the ten people“The post on Telegram… appears to be a deliberate attempt to add credibility to the above said act of terror and the murder of Hiran was a direct outcome of the said act of terror,” the chargesheet says. The NIA says that a demand for a payoff from the Ambani family in the threat posted on Telegram clearly depicts Waze’s motive to reap monetary gains. Waze himself drove the explosive-laden vehicle and parked it near Ambani’s bungalow, it adds. The driver of the police vehicle that accompanied him was unaware about the conspiracy and was told it was a secret operation.

The vehicle was subsequently found to contain a bag of gelatine sticksLater, Waze was the first to reach the spot and got the investigations transferred to himself so that he could vitiate the entire probe, as part of a well-organised conspiracy to instill fear in the Ambani family as well as the general public, the chargesheet said. The next day when the police driver saw the news, he was shocked, but kept silent as Waze threatened him against disclosing anything. The chargesheet further says that Waze also destroyed a visitor’s register maintained by the police commissioner’s office to conceal his and his accomplices’ movements. As part of the conspiracy, Waze had booked a room for 100 nights in Hotel Oberoi in the fictitious name of Sushant Khamkar. He thought it was a safe place for planning and implementation of the plot.

Waze had driven the vehicle and brought it to his own housing society in Thane. Hiran, however, refused to play along after a point, which prompted Waze and his accomplices to eliminate him. NIA said there were two meetings on March 2 and 3 in the police commissioner’s office in which inspector Sunil Mane and former encounter specialist Pradeep Sharma were present. Waze ensured that Hiran was seen here so as to have him identified.

Kazi, who worked under arrested API Sachin Waze in the crime intelligence unit (CIU), is the fourth individual and third police personnel to be arrested in the case. AThe chargesheet also speaks in detail about Hiran’s murder. On March 3, Waze handed over a bag containing cash and a SIM card to Sharma at his PS Foundation office in Andheri. Sharma, in turn, handed over the cash to his associate Santosh Shellar to arrange a vehicle and recruit others. Shellar roped in Anand Jadhav, Satish Mothkuri and Manish Soni. In court proceedings, the prosecution had mentioned that Rs 45 lakh was paid to eliminate Hiran. On March 4 night, Mane called Hiran saying he was ‘Inspector Tawde’ and asked him to meet him on Ghodbunder Road in Thane. After picking up Hiran in his car, he drove to Dwarka Hotel and handed Hiran over to Shellar who was waiting in a Tavera car. Mane took away his mobile phone and told him that he would now be in safe hands. In the moving car, Mothkuri who was seated in the last row grabbed Hiran, smothered him and inserted handkerchiefs in his mouth while Jadhav and Shellar held his hands, said Soni who was driving the vehicle and has turned an approver in the case.

When Hiran’s body was found and taken to CGM hospital in Kalwa, Waze got there while the post-mortem was underway, in a bid to keep tabs on the process, says the chargesheet. Waze and his subordinate API Kazi also illegally took away digital video recorders (DVRs) showing CCTV footage of a housing society near Antilia, Waze’s own housing society and of Hiran’s automobile accessories shop in Thane. Waze with Kazi’s help dumped the digital evidence along with phones used by the gang and fake number plates used for the vehicles in Mithi river in Kurla.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/waze-planned-to-extort-money-from-ambani/articleshow/86021870.cms||Ahmed Ali

While Japanese made socially mindful decisions 72% of the time, followed by Austrians (69%) and Mexicans (68%), participants in Indonesia — the lowest ranked country — took such decisions 46% of the time; the figure stood at 47% for Turkey and 50% for India, according to the research published in the journal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, last week. The researchers found that social mindfulness, in other words, cooperative interpersonal behaviour in which individuals consider others’ needs and perspectives, differed significantly in cross-national research. An international team of 65 researchers had studied human social behaviour at a country level for the project. Most research on human cooperation is based on tasks that require some real effort or investment that makes regard for others come at a cost. But what about small gestures that take no effort, such as letting someone pass on a sidewalk? Participants from neighbouring China made considerate choices 62% of the time while the figure stood at 58% for those in the US and 64% for the UK. Canada, often touted as the “politest country in the world”, was also among the low-scoring countries at 57%. “Many daily acts of cooperation require very little effort. Yet, most research on human cooperation has been on costly behaviour like spending time or money. Less was known about socially mindful behaviours that take hardly any effort,” first author Niels Van Doesum, assistant professor of social psychology at Leiden University, The Netherlands, told TOI. “It is important to not attach any value judgments to the ranking. What’s important here is that we found differences in social mindfulness at the country level which had not been studied. We are still far from explaining the differences. Further research is needed to find answers,” Van Doesum said. The researchers designed 12 hypothetical choices for 8,354 participants in the study. The results showed significant differences between individuals and between countries. Researchers said they studied industrialised countries since a similar stage of the economic development process made for a better comparison.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/indians-among-least-socially-mindful-finds-study/articleshow/86022032.cms||Ruchika Uniyal

BKU (Charuni) leader Gurnam Singh Charuni announced the indefinite sit-in after talks between leaders of the farm agitation and the district administration failed to break the deadlock. A team of officials comprising Karnal Range IG Mamta Singh, Karnal SP Ganga Ram Punia and deputy commissioner Nishant Yadav met the farm leaders again to persuade them to end their protest, but they wouldn't back down. The farmers have been pressing for immediate action against former Karnal SDM Ayush Sinha, who was seen in a video purportedly asking police personnel to smash the heads of protesters assembled there on August 28. They have also asked for Rs 25 lakh in compensation and a government job to the next of kin of farmer Sushil Kajal, who was allegedly assaulted at the protest and died after returning home. Thousands of farmers from various parts of Haryana and Punjab had gathered at the new grain market in Karnal on Tuesday morning in response to the call by the Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) for a mahapanchayat. Most of the senior farmer leaders, including Rakesh Tikait, Charuni, Darshan Pal, Balbir Singh Rajewal, Jagjit Singh Dallewal, and political activist Yogendra Yadav, were present to lead the farmers. Around 11am, the Karnal district administration invited the farm leaders for negotiations. Three rounds of talks were held in the span of around two hours, starting at 1pm, but there was no breakthrough. Immediately after leaving the meeting, Tikait announced that the farmers would march from the new grain market to the mini secretariat. SKM said in a statement later that the Haryana government’s refusal to even consider the demand to suspend former Karnal SDM Sinha, a 2018 batch IAS officer, angered the farmers. "We had lowered our demand from sacking the former SDM to only his suspension, pending an inquiry, but the state government even rejected this. It was totally unjustified. This stance of the state government forced the farmers to opt for a sustained struggle," Yadav said. The farmers started their march to the mini secretariat at 3.30pm, breaching six barricades along the way. While police had intercepted some senior farm leaders once they approached Namaste Chowk, they were let off soon after. Police maintained restraint, only using water cannon on the defiant crowd. "Farmers stand determined and resolute; we stand firmly behind the protest and condemn the actions of the Haryana government," SKM said. Tikait tweeted late on Tuesday that the gathering of protesters would stay put outside the mini secretariat and had already requisitioned clothing and food for the long haul. "We will not stop till we get justice." The district administration had deployed around 40 companies of police personnel to control the situation. "With patience and timely discretion exercised by the district administration, the agitators were allowed to match peacefully towards the mini secretariat," DC Yadav said. Punjab farm unions, on the other hand, are waiting for withdrawal of cases registered after protesting farmers clashed with police in Moga near SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal’s rally. If the administration doesn't do so by Wednesday, the unions will roll out their next phase of agitation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/talks-fail-farmers-begin-sit-in-at-karnal-mini-secretariat/articleshow/86022193.cms||---

In the August 31-September 6 week, 967 women for every 1,000 men took the Corona vaccine. “The vaccination gender parity index (doses to female per 1000 doses to male normalised to gender ratio among 18+) in the past seven days is 1.02,” said Dr Sachin Pandey, a physicist who has been tracking India's vaccination drive on this ‘Covid Tika’ app. The gender ratio among India’s 18+ age group is 944:1000. The gender disparity in the Covid vaccination has been acute. The BMC is, in fact, planning a ‘women only’ vaccination days to iron out the gap of 14.5 lakh at present. “We got a good response for our second-shot-only day and believe women's day will help,” said BMC additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. At the all-India level, 3.6 crore more men than women have taken the vaccine since January. In Maharashtra, the gap has increased from 40 lakh in August to 54 lakh at present. In June, Delhi’s drive had a gender ratio of 600:1000. Dr Pandey said if India can keep up the “nearly crore” daily drives, he believes 80% of India can be vaccinated at least once by mid-October. Between August 31 and September 6, about 5.86 crore vaccine shots—or 83.7 lakh daily—were given in the country. The graphs on the Cowin dashboard clearly show the uptake in vaccination in rural areas in the last few days. On August 31, 1.09 crore doses were given in rural India as against 31.9 lakh in urban areas. Using data from the Cowin dashboard, Dr Pandey worked out that 4.082 crore doses were administered in the rural area in the August 31-September 6 week. ``This means 69.81% of the doses given out in the week went to rural areas, where 65% of India’s population lives,'' he said. His app shows that the disparity in terms of gender and location started improving in June when vaccine stocks improved. ``During the stockouts in April and May, more men than women took the vaccine. Also, at that time, there were myths that women shouldn't take the vaccine during menstruation,’’ he said. At the peak of the second wave, which hit urban pockets earlier than rural areas, the centre diverted more supplies to the hotspots. Many districts in Maharashtra, including Mumbai, got higher stocks as compared to other areas in that period. “However, there is a saturation of sorts in mega cities right now. People need to be counselled about vaccination, especially the second shot, so that numbers improve,” he said. At the moment, the availability of vaccines in the rural areas has improved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-for-first-time-in-vaccination-drive-a-gender-location-equity/articleshow/86022346.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||India||Covid-19: Last 10 crore vaccine doses administered in just 13 days||NEW DELHI: With improved supplies helping the government to accelerate the pace of Covid vaccination across the country, India administered the latest 10 crore doses in just 13 days, taking the total to over 70 crore. Significantly, on three days the tally crossed one crore doses. Covid vaccine delivery had gone up from 50 crore to 60 crore doses in 19 days. With the recent rise in vaccinations, shots delivered per 100 people is also looking respectable at 49.4, just a shade under 50. The bouyancy can be attributed to the sharply-rising graph of first doses administered. Around 72.4 lakh people were vaccinated till 8pm on Tuesday, after India crossed the one-crore mark the day before. Though majority of the doses are being administerd in rural areas, the coverage has improved in urban areas over the past few weeks. The coverage of second shots has increased in several states, even as expansion of the overall vaccination programme is being driven by the first dose, a senior official said. Times ViewVaccination finally seems to have moved into a higher gear. This is good news, especially when a third wave cannot be ruled out. The tempo must be maintained and even increased till the entire nation is fully vaccinated.Overall, people in the age group of 18-44 years account for 50% of the total 70.61 crore doses administered so far, whereas nearly 30% have been given to those aged 45-60 years. The rest are received by those above 60 years of age. In terms of coverage, those between 45-60 account for maximum coverage of first dose at around 66%, whereas the coverage of second dose is maximum among people above 60 years, with around 33.5% being fully vaccinated. In the age band of 18-44, around 44.6% has received at least one dose, whereas only 5.6% got both doses. The Centre has asked states and UTs to ramp up vaccination, particularly among people above 60 as they are most vulnerable to illness as well as fatality due to it their higher burden of comorbidities such as diabetes, heart disorders and kidney ailments. Besides, the government has also stressed on the need to ensure that all those eligible for the second dose of anti-Covid jabs should be covered within the stipulated time frame. Overall, around 57% of the estimated 94 crore adult population has received at least one dose of the vaccines, whereas 17.6% have got both doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-last-10-crore-vaccine-doses-administered-in-just-13-days/articleshow/86022562.cms||Sushmi Dey

A bench of Justices M R Shah and Aniruddha Bose fastened accountability on the Railways for delayed running of trains. It said that if the Railways cannot explain why a train reached its destination late causing inconvenience to passengers, then it would be liable to compensate them in case they filed a deficiency of service complaint before a consumer forum. The SC said passengers’ time is precious and someone must be held accountable for train delays. “These are the days of competition and accountability. If the public transportation has to survive and compete with private players, they have to improve the system and their working culture. Citizen/passenger cannot be at the the mercy of the authorities/administration. Somebody has to accept the responsibility,” it said. Justices Shah and Bose upheld the concurrent orders of the district, state and national consumer forums granting Rs 30,000 compensation with 9% interest to Sanjay Shukla, who with his family missed the 12 noon flight from Jammu to Srinagar because the train scheduled to reach Jammu at 8.10am on June 11, 2016 had chugged into the final stop almost four hours late at 12 noon, leaving the family with no chance of making it on time to the Jammu airport which was at quite a distance from the station. The family had to arrange for a taxi to travel from Jammu to Srinagar at a cost of R 15,000 and pay Rs 10, 000 for lodging at Srinagar. The district consumer forum, Alwar, had surprised the Northern Western Railways by ordering it to reimburse to Shukla the costs incurred towards taxi fare and lodging and also pay an additional Rs 5,000 for mental agony and litigation expenses. The forum’s decision was upheld by State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission and the National Commission. The Railways then appealed against the NCDRC decision in the SC. Additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati argued that in view of Rule 114 and Rule 115 of the Indian Railway Conference Association Coaching Tariff No. 26 Part-I (Volume-I), there shall not be any liability of the railways to pay compensation for train delays. But, the bench was in no mood to accept the argument given the chronicity of delay in running of trains in India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/railways-cant-be-slowcoach-says-supreme-court/articleshow/86022689.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Kerala logged 25,772 cases on Tuesday, accounting for more than two-thirds (67.5%) of the national count of 38,138, and 189 deaths — more than half of India’s toll (363). However, infections were now on the decline in Kerala. The state’s seven-day rolling average of daily cases, a reliable indicator of infection trends, has consistently fallen in the last five days. Meanwhile, Mizoram saw 1,468 cases on Tuesday, its highest daily count till date. Cases have been surging in the tiny state for over two weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-19-keralas-7-day-average-dips-surge-in-mizoram/articleshow/86022778.cms||Amit Bhattacharya

The case tally in the first seven days of September is 2,918 — a third of the entire tally of 9,048 in August. The daily toll has been under five on most days, yet the deaths between September 1 and 7 is also a third of the August toll of 78. In comparison, Maharashtra’s weekly case tally is 28,882, or 18.6% of August’s total of 1.5 lakh cases. The state added under-4,000 cases for the second consecutive day and fatalities have stayed below 100 for six days now. On Tuesday, 3,898 cases and 86 fatalities were reported, taking the total number of cases to 64.9 lakh and fatalities to 1,37,897. Mumbai’s case tally rose to 7.5 lakh and fatalities to 16,000 on Tuesday. Active cases in the state and the city reported a decline. The state now has 47,926 active cases, of which 4,165 are in Mumbai. Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar on Tuesday said the third wave was no longer on the way, but is already here. She appealed to the public to celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi at home and av-oid large gatherings. However, doctors and BMC officials insisted that it was too early to term the present case rise as the beginning of the third wave. Dr Shashank Joshi, member of the state task force, said, “We need to watch the trend for another two weeks before we can say the third wave is here.” BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani. said, “We will have to be cautious at least until October 5, which would be a fortnight after the Ganpati festival ends.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hits-30-of-august-cases-deaths-in-first-7-days-of-september/articleshow/86022833.cms||Malathy Iyer

Daniel Wilkinson lived only 90 minutes by car or 30 minutes by helicopter from Houston, renowned for its top-flight hospitals. In this wealthy state of Texas, 14,700 people were hospitalised as of September 1, just below a record set in January as a winter Covid wave wreaked havoc across America. "In the previous surges, we kept a little over 750 patients. Right now we've been running between 820 and 850 patients, so the hospitals are quite full," said Roberta Schwartz, executive vice-president of Houston Methodist Hospital. Things are so bad that a conference room at one of the facilities is being used to treat patients. So rural health facilities are being forced to keep patients they are not equipped to care for -- like Wilkinson. He was admitted on August 21 to the only hospital in his county, a block from his home in the town of Bellville, whose population is 4,000. The hospital did not have the equipment to remove his gallstones, so it tried to organise a transfer by helicopter to another hospital. "Our staff and physician worked nonstop for over six hours trying to get him that transfer to a tertiary care center anywhere," said Daniel Bonk, the CEO of Bellville Medical Center. "Our emergency room doctor at that time actually went on Facebook trying to get him transferred," said Bonk. A doctor near the Texas capital Austin offered to take in Wilkinson, then called back five minutes later to say there was no room at his hospital. "We get a few calls every day from rural hospital leaders that are just frantically trying to find a place to send these patients," said John Henderson, president of the Texas Organization of Rural and Community Hospitals. Sprawling Texas has 158 such facilities, more than any other US state. He said Wilkinson's case was not an isolated one. "I would say every day this week we've had a situation that didn't end well and resulted in a patient's death," said Henderson. Hospital staff feel powerless and overwhelmed by the frantic search for beds somewhere bigger and more equipped. "We 'lose' a nurse essentially every day, because that nurse has to call all of the hospitals in the surrounding areas to prove that we are doing our due diligence to get them elsewhere," said Renee Poulter who manages the nursing staff at the Bellville hospital. "And that takes hours, hours if not the whole day spent phoning every hospital in the great state of Texas to see if anyone will accept your patient," she added. The Bellville facility is not designed to have an intensive care unit, but like many, out of necessity, it had to fashion one. "We have a critical, ICU-level Covid-positive patient at our rural facility that we have been taking care of for 11 days because we cannot find him a higher level of care," said Poulter. To help them, Texas is providing these uber-busy rural hospitals with respirators, oxygen and other means of stabilising their patients. It is also bringing in nurses from other states. Two such helpers showed up last week in Bellville, one coming from Pennsylvania and the other from Alabama, each working six shifts per week. In one of the hospital's rooms, a 72-year-old local woman named Carmella finishes a meal while her husband keeps her company, a day after she suffered a heart attack. "They did jump in and did as much as they possibly could, but they are just swamped. They tried to transfer me. I heard some of the phone calls. And nobody would take me," said Carmella who did not give her last name. "It's a sad situation." Carmella did eventually get better and was able to go home. Others have not been as fortunate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/in-covid-swamped-texas-patient-dies-stranded-in-rural-hospital/articleshow/86022537.cms||---

Modi was addressing the inaugural conclave of the 10-day ‘Shikshak Parv’ through video-conferencing, where he said the teaching-learning process in the country has to be constantly redefined and redesigned to make India’s education sector world-class. As part of the Shikshak Parv whose theme is ‘Quality and Sustainable Schools: Learnings from Schools in India’, the PM launched the National Digital Architecture (N-DEAR), which he said is likely to play a major role in eradicating inequality in education and its modernisation. He also launched the Indian sign language dictionary (audio- and text-embedded sign language video for the hearing impaired, in conformity with the Universal Design of Learning), talking books (audiobooks for the visually impaired), school quality assurance and assessment framework of CBSE, Nishtha teachers’ training programme for Nipun Bharat and Vidyanjali portal (for facilitating education volunteers/donors/CSR contributors for school development). Expressing confidence that these will not only make our education system globally competitive but also make the youth future-ready, Modi said, “In this rapidly changing era, our teachers also have to learn about new systems and techniques rapidly.” “If we are in the midst of a transformation period, fortunately, we also have a modern and futuristic new National Education Policy. These transformations are not just policy-based but participation-based,” he said. PM Modi praised the contribution of academicians, experts and teachers at every stage in the formulation of the NEP and its implementation. He urged everyone to take this participation to a new level and to involve the society in it. “During Covid, we have witnessed our education sector’s capabilities. There were a lot of challenges, but you solved all. Online classes, group video calls, online exams weren’t heard by many earlier,” he added. The PM also recalled the performance of our athletes in the recently-concluded Olympics and Paralympics and expressed happiness that athletes have accepted his request that every player visit at least 75 schools during Azadi Ka Amrit mahotsav. “This will inspire the students and many will get encouraged to take up sports as career,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-launches-key-initiatives-to-modernise-education-sector/articleshow/86023023.cms||---

At the invitation of national security adviser Ajit Doval, his counterpart and the secretary of the security council of the Russian Federation Nikolay Patrushev will be visiting India for the meeting on September 7-8, the foreign ministry said in a statement. Doval is expected to underscore India’s concerns about the activities of Pakistan-based and India-oriented terror groups like LeT and JeM in Afghanistan. India believes Moscow can play a key role in ensuring Afghanistan isn’t used by such groups to target other countries in the region. The consultations are a follow-up to the telephone conversation between PM Narendra Modi and President Vladimir Putin on 24 August. The two leaders had then expressed the view that it was important for the two strategic partners to work together and instructed their senior officials to remain in touch on Afghanistan. Patrushev is also expected to call on Prime Minister Modi and foreign minister S Jaishankar during the visit. The talks on Afghanistan will take place a day before the Brics summit where Modi, Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected to underline concerns related to Afghanistan.

President Xi Jinping has promoted General Wang Haijiang as the new chief of the Western Theatre Command (WTC), the largest of the five Chinese theatre commands that handles the entire 3,488-km Line of Actual Control from eastern Ladakh to Arunachal Pradesh as well as oversees the restive Tibet and Xinjiang regions. Gen Wang (58) is well acquainted with the WTC, having served in top PLA positions in the Tibet-Xinjiang military regions. He has replaced Gen Xu Qiling (59), who was described as a “rising star” in the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and had taken over as the WTC chief only in July. Gen Xu had replaced Gen Zhang Xudong (60), who in turn had become the WTC chief in December last year after his long-serving predecessor Gen Zhao Zongqi had retired at the age of 65. “All this is highly unusual. Senior PLA generals, especially those heading the WTC, are not changed so soon or abruptly. We are monitoring the developments,” said a senior Indian official. All such changes usually remain shrouded in secrecy in China, with the outside world rarely getting to know the real reasons or implications. “The outgoing WTC chief’s abrupt removal in just about two months could be due to three reasons. One, there were corruption charges against him. Two, he was not keeping well,” said another official. “And three, he failed to perform well on the ground in accordance with the directions issued by the Central Military Commission headed by Xi. It’s premature to say what has happened,” said another official. But the frequent changes in the WTC leadership do indicate Xi is unhappy over the PLA’s performance there. Incidentally, Xi had visited Tibet from July 21 to 23, including some areas close to Arunachal Pradesh, in the first such official presidential visit to the region in 30 years. Gen Wang takes over the WTC at a time when India has sought the 13th round of corps commander-level talks with China, with the last one on July 31 leading to the completion of the stalled troop disengagement at patrolling point-17A (PP-17A) near India’s crucial Gogra post. Earlier, in February, the two armies had disengaged in the Pangong Tso-Kailash Range region. But the deadlock over the other friction points at Hot Springs, Demchok and the strategically-located Depsang Plains still continues, with the overall de-escalation along the LAC in eastern Ladakh not on the horizon yet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/for-third-time-in-9-months-china-changes-top-commander-overseeing-disputed-border/articleshow/86023265.cms||Rajat Pandit

Gen Wang takes over the WTC at a time when India has sought the 13th round of corps commander-level talks with China, with the last one on July 31 leading to the completion of the stalled troop disengagement at patrolling point-17A (PP-17A) near India’s crucial Gogra post. Earlier, in February, the two armies had disengaged in the Pangong Tso-Kailash Range region. But the deadlock over the other friction points at Hot Springs, Demchok and the strategically-located Depsang Plains still continues, with the overall de-escalation along the LAC in eastern Ladakh not on the horizon yet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/for-third-time-in-9-months-china-changes-top-commander-overseeing-disputed-border/articleshow/86023268.cms||Rajat Pandit

While a Samajwadi Party MLA in UP on Tuesday demanded a similar room in the UP Vidhan Sabha, a BJP MLA in Bihar has asked for an arrangement for chanting the “Hanuman Chalisa” and reciting the “Bhagavad Gita” by Hindu legislators. A PIL was filed at the Jharkhand high court against the decision by the state assembly, calling it a “strike on secularism” and protests marked assembly proceedings as several BJP MLAs came dressed as Hindu priests. They wanted the speaker to call the lunch break 30 minutes ahead of its schedule on Tuesdays so that BJP lawmakers could pray to Lord Hanuman.

J&K Lieutenant-Governor Manoj Sinha, while launching a portal on Tuesday to enable Kashmiri migrants to submit online grievances regarding their properties in Kashmir and secure a time-bound redressal, said it will alleviate the plight of around 44,000 migrant families — of which 40,142 are from the Hindu community, 2,684 from Muslim community and 1,730 from Sikh fold — and enable them to return to their ancestral homes in Kashmir with dignity, bringing closure and undoing years of injustice. The complaints received on the portal will be disposed of in a fixed time-frame under the Public Services Guarantee Act, 2011 by the revenue authorities. The deputy commissioner has been given the authority to undertake field verification or survey of migrant properties and update all registers within 15 days before submitting a compliance report to the divisional commissioner, Kashmir. The district magistrate will take timely action for eviction, custody and restoration of encroached/forcibly taken properties and initiate action against the violators. The portal, being run on a trial basis since August 21, received 854 complaints during the trial period. This is in sharp contrast to 113 complaints received by the office relief and rehabilitation commissioner between 2018-19 and 2020-2021. Speaking at the launch, LG Sinha said the initiative, based on ideals of former PM A B Vajpayee and PM Narendra Modi, was an outcome of good governance practices of the UT government. “It is the responsibility of the present to rectify the mistakes of the past… I request all citizens to support the administration in this effort and set a new example of brotherhood”, Sinha said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/portal-to-help-kashmiri-migrants-file-plaints-reclaim-properties/articleshow/86023348.cms||---
---||India||Retired Colonel on RIL staff was first to spot SUV near Antilia||MUMBAI: A retired army colonel, the president of a Reliance group company handling security-related matters, was the first to notice the abandoned vehicle outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence, Antilia, on February 25. The vehicle was subsequently found to contain a bag of gelatine sticks and a letter carrying a threat addressed to Mukesh Ambani and his wife Nita Ambani. The 53-year-old Reliance official, a witness in the case against 10 individuals including five former cops allegedly involved in Mansukh Hiran’s murder, recalled that moments before discovering the vehicle, he had walked from Antilia to Carmichael Road to meet with the widow of an RIL Jamnagar employee who had recently died of a heart attack. The woman was at the gate of the residence to express her grievance and demand more compensation. He said he noticed the SUV while talking to her. The witness told the National Investigation Agency (NIA) that a clean number plate on an otherwise dusty vehicle drew his attention; the registration number, he realised, had the same last four digits as allotted to vehicles used by the Ambani family’s security entourage. After verification by his team, it was found that the vehicle had the same registration number as that of a Range Rover belonging to the security entourage of Nita Ambani. The witness said that police were immediately informed. “Meanwhile, my team members cross checked with neighbouring residences but nobody had any clue on who parked the vehicle,” he said. Police arrived and called the bomb detection and disposal squad. “I was informed by the police authorities that one bag containing gelatin sticks and a threat letter to Mukesh Ambani and Nita Ambani, were recovered from the SUV,” the witness said. He said this was immediately conveyed to Ambani and a scheduled trip by Nita at 4pm from Antilia to the airport was put off and later cancelled. “On February 25 Nita Ambani was to leave for Jamnagar but after this incident her programme was postponed after the advice of DCP Rajiv Jain and by me,” he told NIA. The witness further said cops informed him that the gelatin sticks were not assembled. “Earlier also the Ambani family had been receiving threats from various quarters but all were related to farmers protests that began in October 2020. The family does not suspect any particular person for the threat letter and gelatin sticks found in the abandoned Mahindra Scorpio found parked illegally on Carmichael Road on February 25,” the witness had told NIA on March 10. In a statement on February 26 to the Mumbai anti-terror squad, the agency which was earlier probing the case, the same witness had said that due to his years in the forces and more so in a “counter insurgency” wing, any suspicious object, person or movement was immediately noticed by him. “After the incident JSR was carried out by CRPF, IB and local police authorities. Security of Antilia surrounding was increased by police,” the witness said. He also said the Ambanis had received threats earlier. Hence, the Centre had provided CRPF security in 2013.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/retired-colonel-on-ril-staff-was-first-to-spot-suv-near-antilia/articleshow/86023388.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||India||Bailable warrant against Param Bir||MUMBAI: The Justice Chandiwal commission set up by the Maharashtra government to probe former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh’s allegations against former state home minister Anil Deshmukh issued on Tuesday a bailable warrant against Singh for securing his attendance before the panel on September 22. This is the first time in the Maharashtra police force’s recent history that a warrant has been issued in the name of a serving IPS officer for securing his presence. Ever since the probe began, Singh has been on medical leave. “Conduct of Param Bir Singh warrants condemnation as invited by himself, (sic) has compelled the commission to issue a warrant against him in the sum of Rs 50,000. Considering the status and stature of Param Bir Singh, the director general of police is requested to depute a high-ranking... police officer to execute the warrant. All safety measures for maintenance of law and order and medical examination as per rules shall equally be taken,” Justice K U Chanidwal observed in his three-page order. Justice Chandiwal said the commission has been given all powers under the Commission of Inquiry Act, but in spite of that, the matter has been dragged. The panel said “an afflicted class suffers brunt of orders” while a high- ranking police officer, supposedly well versed with law, avoided the commission “on pretexts referred in earlier orders... which apparently are untenable”. The concessions extended to him have been “misused,” it said, and added that on earlier occasions, the commission did not act, but a hint was given. “Today is the 15th date of hearing.. it is (sic) unexpected of such a high-ranking officer to abstain himself for 15 dates and to ensure calculatedly to get the inquiry protracted under the ruse of filing a writ petition or pendency of a PIL filed by an advocate, with which he has no concern,” Justice Chandiwal stated. Following a letter written by Singh to CM Uddhav Thackeary alleging Deshmukh had set a target of mobilising Rs 100 crore from restaurant and bar owners, the state government on March 30 set up the one-man commission. Because of Singh’s failure to appear, the commission so far has imposed on him a cost of Rs 55,000. Accordingly, he has deposited the amount in the chief minister’s relief fund for Covid-19. Singh has not attended the proceedings saying he has challenged the validity of the commission. His lawyer had sought an adjournment, saying the high court may pass an order soon, but when no order was passed till Tuesday, Justice Chandiwal issued the warrant. Singh’s plea for adjournment was opposed by Deshmukh’s lawyer Anita Castellino, who had, at the last hearing, urged the commission to issue a warrant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bailable-warrant-against-param-bir/articleshow/86023468.cms||Prafulla Marapakwar

The 46-year-old woman has been charged with falsely reporting a bomb, explosive or weapon of mass destruction, according to a Broward Sheriff's Office news release. Airline employees told responding deputies that the woman had stated that a bomb was in her checked-in luggage that was aboard a plane, officials said. She made the claim after workers told her that she and her party had arrived too late to board the plane, detectives said. The plane was already taxiing out to the runway but had not taken off when it was rerouted. Passengers were evacuated, and the plane was searched. No explosives were found, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/woman-held-for-falsely-raising-bomb-scare-after-missing-flight-sheriff/articleshow/86023401.cms||---

Congress president Sonia Gandhi is seized of the issue and sources said there has not been any discussion on Kishore since July, a period during which the party was busy with the monsoon session of Parliament as also other developments, mostly firefighting in its state units. If the high-profile poll strategist joins Congress, sources said it will not be a plain induction announcing his arrival, but is likely to be put out in public as part of a special committee of the AICC. Kishore, as reported by TOI, has asked Congress leadership to form an “empowered group” to take decisions on the party’s strategy and election management. Kishore’s entry into Congress will be with the sole focus of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. He may also be part of future contests in the states, but he’s likely to keep away from the coming batch of elections in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur. The five states will go to polls around February-March next year. These state polls are critical for Congress which is starved of election wins and desperately needs victories under its belt to boost the morale of party workers as also to reassert its utility in the joint opposition bloc. The possibility of Kishore joining the Congress has already triggered murmurs in the party, especially in the G23 dissenters bloc, though Kishor has the support of a strong section of state satraps who feel he would be a “positive addition” to the organisation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/prashant-kishore-may-join-congress-as-part-of-special-panel-handling-polls/articleshow/86023570.cms||---

At their meeting, Thakur announced India and Bangladesh will release a biopic on ‘Bangabandhu’ Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in March 2022 to commemorate 50 years of Bangladesh’s liberation and 75 years of Indian Independence. The two ministers also discussed the celebration of ‘Maitri Diwas’ on December 6, for which an ‘action plan’ will be drawn up and released soon. Mahmud, the first Bangladeshi leader to travel to India after Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Dhaka in January this year, also met with external affairs minister S Jaishankar. Describing his meetings with the ministers as “very good”, Mahmud, at a function organised by the Bangladesh high commission, emphasised the need for “greater integration” in the region. “People-to-people contact and bond shared between people of the two countries is prehistoric. But this is also one of the least integrated places. That is the reality... We have to work on that issue... Even though we speak the same language and have the same culture... for movement of people, there are many obstacles till today. These have to be lifted or made a lot easier,” he said. Jaishankar said that he discussed media and bilateral cooperation with Mahmud. Mahmud, who is on a three-day visit to India, also said he was moved during the event to inaugurate the ‘Bangabandhu Media Centre’ at the Press Club of India on Monday and reiterated his gratitude to the Indian people and soldiers who contributed to Bangladesh’s liberation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/thakur-meets-bangladesh-minister-says-delhi-and-dhaka-to-release-mujib-biopic-in-march-2022/articleshow/86023604.cms||Swati Mathur
---||World||More deaths from 9/11-linked illnesses than in attack: Report||More people are believed to have died from illnesses related to 9/11 than were killed on the actual day of the Al-Qaeda attacks on New York and Washington, according to a report published on Tuesday. The September 11 Victim Compensation Fund (VCF) has received more than 67,000 claims since it reopened in 2011. Nearly 3,900 of those claims were filed on behalf of someone who is alleged to have died of a 9/11-related illness, the VCF said in a report. "That means that the number of people believed to have died of a 9/11-related illness subsequent to 9/11 has now exceeded the number of people who died on 9/11," said Rupa Bhattacharyya, the "special master" who administers the fund. "More people are now believed to have died of 9/11-related illnesses than were lost on September 11, 2001," she said. Nearly 50% of those filing claims in recent years have cancer. Nearly 3,000 people were killed when Al-Qaeda hijackers flew planes into the World Trade Center towers in New York and the Pentagon in Washington. Another plane crashed into a field in Pennsylvania. A compensation fund was created immediately following the attacks for the families of victims. In 2011, another fund was created for first responders and others suffering from chronic health conditions arising from the 9/11 attacks. The VCF has issued compensation of more than $8.95 billion to more than 40,000 individuals. President Joe Biden is scheduled to visit the sites of the 9/11 attacks on Saturday to mark the 20th anniversary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/more-deaths-from-9/11-linked-illnesses-than-in-attack-report/articleshow/86023299.cms||---

His remark was seen as an indirect attack on former deputy CM Sachin Pilot and his loyalist MLAs, one of whom allegedly played a key role in cross-voting in the Jaipur zila parishad election that resulted in Congress losing to BJP despite a majority on Monday. On Monday night Gehlot, too, made a veiled attack on Pilot, saying that people responsible forhorse-trading in panchayat polls were the same people who had tried to topple the state government earlier. The remark was in reference to Pilot’s revolt against his leadership in July 2020. Despite a Congress majority in the Jaipur zila pramukh poll, the discord started after cross-voting and rebellion by two elected Congress members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/after-gehlot-minister-targets-pilot-for-zila-poll-jolt/articleshow/86023644.cms||Joychen Joseph

Vaidya also said the magazine will have to target people, who might be right but are on the wrong side, which, he argued, is the spirit of dharma yudha. “Panchjanya stands for dharma yudh, which has two sides. You can have good people on the wrong side, and you will have to strike your arrows at them too,” he said. Vaidya cited the example of Arjuna in Mahabharata, who fought against Bhisma after saluting him with the arrow before waging war against him. The endorsement to the Panchjanya team by a senior Sangh member is being seen by many as not coincidental but a message that the saffron fountain-head strongly stands with the magazine and its editorial policies. The prompt response from the RSS distancing itself from the Panchajanya weekly report was seen in context with the “bipartisan” image of the IT major’s founder Narayana Murthy. The Panchjanya made serious allegations against Infosys saying the company might be deliberately trying to destabilise the Indian economy and accused it of helping ‘Naxals, leftists and tukde-tukde gang’. Ambekar told TOI that the magazines published by Bharat Prakashan — Organiser and Panchajanya — are headed by RSS swayamsevaks but it doesn’t mean that anything they write is the RSS viewpoint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/panchjanya-stands-for-dharma-yudh-says-key-rss-neta-after-infosys-row/articleshow/86023738.cms||---

The three-member committee, constituted by the Supreme Court on January 12 for recommendations on the farm laws, had submitted its report to the apex court on March 19. The Supreme Court, which suspended the implementation of three central farm laws, has not taken up the matter in the past over five months. Agriculture economists and farm sector experts Ashok Gulati and P K Joshi areother members of the panel. “As a member of the committee, especially representing the farmers’ community, I’m pained that the issue raised by farmers aren’t yet resolved and the agitation is continuing,” said Ghanwat in his letter to chief justice on September 1 while referring to ongoing farmers’ protests, mainly in Punjab, Haryana, western UP and Rajasthan. Noting that the committee incorporated opinions and suggestions of all stakeholders, Ghanwat claimed the report addressed all apprehensions of the farmers. “The committee was confident that the recommendations will pave the way to resolve the ongoing farmers’ agitation,” he said, urging the Supreme Court to release the report for implementation of its recommendations for “peaceful resolution of the stalemate to the farmers’ satisfaction at the earliest."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/farm-report-ignored-make-it-public-panel-member-tells-cji/articleshow/86023808.cms||---

The failure of samples in case of cables and flush doors are as high as 20% each while an average of 15% cement samples failed in tests and in the case of TMT bar 10% samples could not meet the specified standards. Officials in the consumer affairs ministry said the six NTHs across the country test around 25,000 samples annually. The NTHs don’t pick samples on their own but get them from manufacturers and consumers. “They share the test reports and this helps manufacturers to modify their products. Most of these products fall under the quality control norms, which require mandatory certification from BIS. The BIS certifies products only when these pass the tests from NTHs and other laboratories,” said an official. Union consumer affairs secretary Leena Nandan said the NTHs function as testing laboratories for the smallest to the biggest items.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/electric-cables-and-flush-doors-have-high-rate-of-failure-in-tests/articleshow/86023854.cms||Dipak K Dash

A bench of Justices Indira Banerjee and J K Maheshwari granted them relief and directed that they be released on bail while agreeing to hear their plea challenging UP government decision not to grant them premature release from jail. The prisoners moved the SC through advocate Rishi Malhotra who pleaded that the SC recently directed the release of many similarly situated prisoners and the same interim relief be granted to them. “The petitioners who are languishing in various jails in UP sought to highlight a very shocking and sorry state of affairs in the state in as much as despite undergoing more than 20 years of total sentence and despite being entitled for premature release under the policy dated 1.8.18 having statutory force under Article 161 of the Constitution, they continue to languish in jails which is nothing but amounting to illegal detentions,” he contended. Agreeing with his plea, the bench said, “Issue notice returnable in three weeks. Since the petitioners have been in jail for over 20 years, they shall be released on ad interim bail subject to the terms and conditions.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/supreme-court-paves-way-for-release-of-66-prisoners-who-spent-20-years-in-agra-jail/articleshow/86023959.cms||---

While hearing a legal battle between Registrar General & Census Commission and LIC, a bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and M M Sundresh said that some kind of mechanism should be put in place by the government to resolve such disputes and court should not be burdened with such cases. The court said that there are many such cases being filed in courts including disputes between public sector units and tax department. “I have not found government taking a stand to sort out such problems and they always want court to sort out the problems,” the SC said.

Expressing concern over some of the judgements written by HC judges, a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah said it was very difficult to appreciate what the judge wants to convey through the judgment and the court is forced to remand the case for fresh consideration. Observing that a verdict, delivered by Allahabad HC while granting bail to five life convicts, lacked clarity, the bench said that it is very unfortunate that the SC bench has to explain how the judgement should be written and and what should be contained in it. The SC set aside the bail orders. “A judgment should be coherent, systematic and logically organised. It should enable the reader to trace the fact to a logical conclusion on the basis of legal principles. It is pertinent to examine the important elements in a judgment in order to fully understand the art of reading a judgment,” the bench said. “The judgment replicates the individuality of the judge and therefore it is indispensable that it should be written with care and caution. The reasoning in the judgment should be intelligible and logical. Clarity and precision should be the goal. All conclusions should be supported by reasons duly recorded. The findings and directions should be precise and specific. Writing judgments is an art (and) involves skilful application of law and logic,” the bench said. Though the bench said that it is conscious that judges are overburdened with work, but said that quality can never be sacrificed for quantity. “...whenever a judgment is written, it should have clarity on facts; on submissions made on behalf of the rival parties; discussion on law points and thereafter reasoning and the ultimate conclusion...” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/write-easy-to-comprehend-verdicts-with-clarity-on-facts-supreme-court-to-hc-judges/articleshow/86024032.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

A senior officer confirmed the arrest. With this, all seven from Tiruppur and Erode districts accused in the assault are in custody. The youth arrested is in his mid-20s and will be brought to Mysuru on Wednesday. He’ll be produced before a local court and may be taken into police custody for questioning. He had been on the run since the incident on August 24. Police formed five teams to nab the accused soon after the gang rape was reported on August 25. Cops nabbed five men within four days and another man three days later. Initially, it was believed six men were involved in the crime and an FIR was registered by Alanahalli police against six unknown persons. After five persons, including a 17-year-old boy were arrested, the name of another accused surfaced and he was immediately arrested. The members allegedly gang-raped a 22-year-old MBA student on Lalithadripura hillock, next to Chamundi Hills, on August 24.

In a suo motu statement in the state assembly, Stalin said despite a financial crisis the state government would implement the dearness allowance hike from January 1, 2022, which is three months in advance, following requests from government employees’ unions. "Due to this decision, 16 lakh government employees and pensioners will be benefited. The government will incur an additional expenditure of 620crore and an annual expenditure of 6,480crore," he said. Stalin said the government would end the practice of suspending government employees, facing disciplinary and other charges, on the last working day. He further announced that the government would release new guidelines simplifying the norms for appointment under compassionate grounds. "After considering the demands of employees’ unions, the government decided to regularize the strike and suspension periods of government employees, who participated in various strikes called by unions in 2016, 2017 and 2019. The teachers, who were transferred will be given priority in transfer counselling. The government will cancel all disciplinary actions initiated against teachers during the strike and in case their promotion is affected by the disciplinary action, it will be rectified," CM said. Further, the retirement age for noon meal workers would be increased from 58 to 60 years. The CM said the increment for higher educational qualification which was cancelled in 2020 would be restored again by following the Union government's guidelines. "With increase in enrolment in government schools, the government will take measures to appoint more teachers to meet the teacher: student ratio," he said. The chief minister said steps would be taken to fill vacancies for posts of junior assistants in government schools through Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission (TNPSC). Moreover, an order would be passed to include sons and daughters of government employees, dependent on them, without considering their age, under the health insurance scheme for government staff. For Covid-19 treatment, the government would fund the excess amount in case the treatment cost exceeds 10 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/cm-advances-disbursement-of-hike-in-dearness-allowance-for-govt-staff/articleshow/86020069.cms||---

Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin made the announcement in the state assembly on Tuesday while responding to questions relating to the Covid-19 restrictions and the ban on public celebration of Vinayaka Chathurthi in the state. This is besides the 5000 they were given during monsoon when they are out of work. The chief minister said the government was providing financial relief of 5,000 to around 12,000 potters, who could not work during monsoon. "Among them, around 3,000 make Vinayaka idols during the festival season. They have lost their livelihood as celebrating the festival in public places has been banned the last two years. Considering this, the government will give additional aid to these workers along with monsoon relief this year," Stalin said. "Due to the relaxations announced for Onam and Bakrid in Kerala, the Covid-19 positive cases increased in that state. Tamil Nadu is yet to fully emerge out of the Covid-19 infections. Cases are being reported at isolated places with 50 cases increasing or decreasing every day. Considering the public safety and welfare, a ban on all religious festivals was imposed till September 15. It will also apply to Vinayaka Chathurthi," Stalin said in the assembly. "There is a ban only for celebrating religious festivals like Vinayaka Chathurthi in public places. Individuals can still celebrate it in their houses by following Covid-19 protocols. ," he added. The chief minister was replying to BJP MLA Nainar Nagendran’s demand that the state should allow Vinayaka idol processions like states such as Maharashtra, Karnataka and Puducherry. Stalin said the restrictions had been announced to avoid public gatherings till September 30 as per the instructions from the Union home ministry. He said even the courts have highlighted the same. Replying to a question from DMK MLA A P Nandakumar, HR & CE minister P K Sekar Babu said the government will give financial aid of 5000 to 1749 temple barbers, who possess ID cards. The state government announced that tonsuring heads at temples would be free for devotees and some leaders raised concerns about the livelihood of barbers working in temples. He further said the temples would give 30 per person to barbers for tonsuring devotees' heads.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/5000-aid-to-3000-vinayaka-idol-makers/articleshow/86024085.cms||---

The programme was launched in January, 2019 to improve air quality through a city-specific action plan in all such cities which do not meet the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Under the NCAP, the Centre and states together would work to reduce the level of particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) by 20-30% from the 2017 (base year) level by 2024. “Eighty-six cities showed better air quality in 2019 in comparison to 2018 and this number increased to 104 cities in 2020,” said environment minister Bhupender Yadav at an event to mark the second International Day of Clean Air for Blue Skies. He, on the occasion, launched the portal and virtually inaugurated the first functional smog tower of India at Anand Vihar in the Capital. Addressing stakeholders, Yadav also shared details of all the initiatives which the government took to improve air quality in the country. The second International Day of Clean Air for Blue Skies was also marked by first India–Japan high level policy dialogue between Yadav and Koizumi Shinjiro, environment minister of Japan, where both the countries discussed issues on air pollution, sustainable technologies and transports, climate change, marine litter, and issues related to upcoming 26th session of the UN climate conference (COP26).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/now-a-portal-to-help-improve-air-quality-in-132-polluted-cities/articleshow/86024098.cms||---
---||Guwahati||Assam: Health department official held in forgery case||GUWAHATI: Police on Tuesday arrested a health department employee for allegedly forging the signatures of the members of the state-level medical referral board to claim medical reimbursement. The accused, identified as Ganesh Kalita, is an employee at the Khanapara State Dispensary in the city. Kalita was produced before the court of the chief judicial magistrate, Kamrup (Metro) and taken into seven-day police custody for further investigation. Dipjyoti Dadhara, officer in-charge of Bhangagarh police station, said, “More government officials are likely to be in police net soon in connection with the forgery case. The investigation has been intensified. Gauhati Medical College and Hospital authority and other departments are cooperating in the investigation.” He said the kingpin must have known the entire procedure of how to get a medical referral certificate, which has to be approved by the state-level medical referral board. The medical board comprises GMCH principal as chairperson, GMCH superintendent as member secretary and three members. A government official has to submit a medical referral certificate duly signed by the members of the medical board along with the bills at the respective departments. A medical referral certificate is given to a government official for medical treatment outside the state. GMCH filed three separate FIRs against a total of 41 officials of different government departments, including Assam Power Distribution Corporation Limited (APDCL), department of elementary education and the finance department. A total of 34 officials right from assistant general manager to the grade IV employees of the APDCL have siphoned off over Rs 1.46 crore by forging medical referral certificates and other documents in the name of availing medical reimbursements. However, the police are yet to arrest the APDCL officials. The police officer said nobody will be spared if found involved in forging the documents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/health-dept-official-held-in-forgery-case/articleshow/86020683.cms||Mukut Das
---||World||Biden warns of climate change 'code red' in visit to storm damage||NEW YORK: President Joe Biden said Tuesday the world faces a "code red" on climate change danger as he visited damage from the aftermath of Hurricane Ida in New York and New Jersey. "We've got to listen to the scientists and the economists and the national security experts. They all tell us this is code red," Biden said in the hard-hit New York borough of Queens, which he toured after visiting Manville, New Jersey. "The nation and the world are in peril. That's not hyperbole. That is a fact," he said. Biden -- who is pushing a giant infrastructure spending bill, including major funding for the green economy -- argues that extreme weather across the United States this summer is a harbinger of worse to come. "This is everybody's crisis," he said in the speech. "These disasters aren't going to stop. They're only going to come with more frequency and ferocity." Systemic upgrading and hardening of the nation's infrastructure is an urgent need, he asserted, pointing to proposed changes such as flood-proofing power stations, raising up buildings and burying electrical lines. "You can't just build back to what it was before, because another tornado, another 10 inches of rain is going produce the same kind of results," Biden said in earlier remarks in New Jersey. "I think we're at one of those inflection points where we're going to act or we're going to be in real, real trouble. Our kids are going to be in real trouble." Ida struck the US Gulf Coast as a Category 4 hurricane, bringing major flooding and knocking out power to large parts of the heavily populated region, which is also a main hub for the oil industry. Just last week, Biden made a similar tour to Louisiana, where Ida had originally mand landfall. However, the departing remnants of the hurricane then caught authorities in the New York region by surprise, with ferocious rainfall triggering flash flooding. The final blast of the storm killed at least 47 people in the US Northeast as it turned streets into raging rivers, inundated basements and shut down the New York subway. And while one part of the country buckles under hurricane fallout, California and other parts of the western region are struggling to combat ever-fiercer wildfires. With his presidency straining from the aftermath of the Afghanistan pullout and surging Covid infections at home, Biden faces a difficult coming few weeks, including a struggle to get his infrastructure plans through the narrowly divided Congress. The White House hopes that the dramatic impact from Hurricane Ida in two different parts of the country will galvanize action on the spending bills. "It's so imperative that we act on addressing the climate crisis and investing... through his 'Build Back Better' agenda, which is working its way through Congress," White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-warns-of-climate-change-code-red-in-visit-to-storm-damage/articleshow/86024659.cms||---
---||Business||No need to enter your full card details on e-tail sites||MUMBAI: Customers will not have to input their credit card details on e-commerce sites they frequent even after the RBI rule barring storage of card data by merchants kicks in from January 1, 2022. Fast checkouts can continue with the RBI permitting card-on-file tokenisation. This allows customers to ask their banks to issue tokens to the online merchant in place of card details. This will enable subsequent payments without the card details. Earlier, the RBI had allowed tokenisation for devices. Customers could register their NFC device — either a phone or a watch — with their card-issuing bank. Then, the card-issuing bank would provide the application on the device a token that is linked to the customer’s card number. As a result, every time the customer does a tap-to-pay transaction using the phone or watch, the token number is passed to the bank, which approves the transaction after recognising the device and the token. If a fraudster gets hold of the token details, they cannot be used for payment as it would not be coming from the registered device. Also, tokenisation would still require two-factor authentication. Even if hackers breach an e-commerce site, all they can get is tokens which cannot be used by anyone else. As against this, a breach today will provide them with the full card details that are accepted for payment in some countries without an OTP. “The device-based tokenisation framework advised vide circulars of January 2019 and August 2021 has been extended to Card-on-File Tokenisation (CoFT) services as well,” the RBI said. What this means is that while earlier customers could get tokens for payments using applications such as Samsung Pay, they can now ask their banks to issue tokens to e-commerce sites as well. The central bank has reiterated that with effect from January 1, no entity in the card transaction/payment chain, other than the card-issuers and card networks, can store card data. “Any such data stored previously shall be purged. For transaction tracking and reconciliation purposes, entities can store limited data — the last four digits of the card number and card-issuer’s name — in compliance with the applicable standards,” the RBI said. “Contrary to some concerns expressed in certain sections of the media, there would be no requirement to input card details for every transaction under the tokenisation arrangement. The efforts of the RBI to deepen digital payments in India and make such payments safe and efficient shall continue,” the central bank said in its circular. Some IT experts, however, said that if crores of debit cards have to be tokenised, it would put a lot of burden on bank infrastructure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/no-need-to-enter-your-full-card-details-on-e-tail-sites/articleshow/86021638.cms||---
---||Business||Dish TV gains 13% after Yes Bank move to sack board||Mayur.Shetty@timesgroup.com Mumbai: Shares of Dish TV were up nearly 13% on Tuesday after Yes Bank moved a shareholder proposal to overthrow the board, including the managing director and CEO Jawahar Lal Goel. The private lender, which acquired just below 26% in the company following debt resolution, served notice to remove five directors and proposed seven directors to be appointed in their place. In June, the company’s board had approved the raising of funds through a rights issue of Rs 1,000 crore. The promoters of Dish TV had pledged their holding for credit facilities used by the Essel Group. With lenders revoking the pledge, the promoter stake in the firm had fallen to below 6%. Yes Bank’s notice comes ahead of the company’s annual general meeting on September 27. Shares of the company rose to a high of Rs 16 during intraday trade on Tuesday before closing at Rs 15.5, up 12.7% from the previous close of Rs 13.8. Explaining the grounds for removal of the board, the bank said the directors approved a rights issue process despite pending objections raised with them time and again, solely to dilute the shareholding of the bank, which is the largest shareholder, and to prejudice its interest. According to a Yes Bank notice to the exchange, banks and financial institutions hold around 45% stake in the company, but the board is acting at the behest of minority shareholders holding merely 6% of the shares. The bank also said that the board had completely sidelined its multiple requests to reconstitute the board. The notice has been sent to the board under Section 169 of the Companies Act, which empowers shareholders to remove a director. The company secretary has informed the exchange that it is taking steps to get the candidatures of the proposed new directors cleared from the information & broadcasting ministry, as prior approval of the authority is required. The other four directors sought to be removed are Rashmi Aggarwal, who is currently associated with IMT-Ghaziabad and is on the board of other Essel Group companies, B D Narang, former chairman of Oriental Bank of Commerce, Shankar Aggarwal, an IAS officer, and Ashok Mathai Kurien, an entrepreneur. Yes Bank has informed the exchanges that it has made repeated requests to the board to induct Akash Suri and Sanjay Nambiar who are part of the company’s top management and experts in their respective field. The bank has again proposed their names with five other directors. These are Vijay Bhatt, Haripriya Padmanabhan, Girish Paranjpe, N V Prabhutendulkar and Arvind Nachaya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/dish-tv-gains-13-after-yes-bank-move-to-sack-board/articleshow/86020462.cms||Mayur Shetty

Both Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) and Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH) are short of beds in their paediatric intensive care units (PICUs) and neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). PMCH superintendent Dr I S Thakur said the number of patients admitted exceeded the beds. “However, we have arranged extra beds on the floor. Oxygen is also available to all the serious patients and there is nothing to worry about,” he said. Thakur said the paediatrics department has around 125 beds. He admitted that most of the children had monsoon-related problems like high fever, cough and pneumonia. “However, their recover rate is also higher. The PMCH is currently undergoing renovation and many of its old buildings are being demolished,” he said. All the beds in PICU and NICU at the NMCH also remained full. Though the hospital authorities were busy arranging extra beds in the wards, many people had to move with their patients to other health facilities having PICU. NMCH superintendent Dr Binod Kumar Singh said the monsoon ailments increased the number of child patients in the hospital. “There are 87 children admitted against the 84 beds in the paediatric ward. All the 22 beds in NICU and 15 in PICU are full. Three beds in the general paediatric ward are being shared by two children each. However, there is no Covid case,” he said. In fact, the other wards were more crowded. “We are accommodating 836 patients against 761 beds by putting extra beds arranged from different other departments,” Dr Singh said. He, however, stated that there was no shortage of medicines, injections or oxygen and all the patients were being given proper medical care. About 60% beds in the paediatric department at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna (AIIMS-P) were also full while the occupancy in its PICU reached about 80%, said head of the paediatrics department, Dr Lokesh Tiwari. “Respiratory troubles, neurological problems, gastrointestinal infection, pneumonia and high fever are the important diseases the children have been suffering from,” he said. However, there was no such report from the IGIMS. Patna civil surgeon Dr Vibha Kumari Singh said after first consultation in the OPDs at primary health centres, children with serious problems are usually rushed to PMCH and NMCH for better treatment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/monsoon-related-diseases-on-the-rise-among-children/articleshow/86018582.cms||VK Tripathi

We believe it’s a small gesture compared to her enthusiasm. It felt great to see her happy when we conducted the ceremony,” Babu told TOI. Clad in a grand green pattu saree, Bangaramma was seated on a throne chair right outside the police station and showered with blessings and gifts. A video of the ceremony soon went viral across social media with netizens appreciating the healthy work atmosphere at the police station which is stereotypically portrayed in movies as a toxic environment.

Addressing the RJD’s ‘Milan Samaroh’ at the party office here, Tejashwi said the people of the state were fed up with the NDA government and wanted to get rid of it. “Their frustration will manifest in the byelection to the two seats,” he added. Accusing the RSS of causing division in the political families for its political gains, Tejashwi said the organisation believed in divide and rule policy. “Bhai ko bhai se ladana RSS ka siddhant hai,” he added. Exhorting the party workers to face the challenges ahead, the former deputy CM said in many constituencies, including Parbatta in Khagaria district, the RJD candidates were denied victory certificates on frivolous grounds in the 2020 assembly polls. Taking a swipe at the NDA government, Tejashwi alleged that nearly 15 lakh people lost their jobs during Covid pandemic in the state while the NDA government had promised to provide jobs to 19 lakh youths. Taking a swipe at CM Nitish Kumar, the RJD leader said the former tried to gauge the mood of the people ahead of byelection in the name of aerial survey of Kusheshwar Asthan, which is inundated with floodwaters. While Tarapur seat in Munger district fell vacant after the death of serving JD(U) MLA and former minister Mewalal Choudhary, byelection in Kusheshwar Asthan was necessitated by the death of BJP MLA Shashi Bhushan Hazari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rjd-to-wrest-kusheshwar-asthan-and-tarapur-seats-from-nda/articleshow/86019572.cms||Ramashankar
---||Vijayawada||PIL challenges appointment of Kanagaraj as police body chair||Vijayawada: A public interest litigation petition was filed on Tuesday before the AP high court challenging the appointment of Justice V Kanagaraj as chairman of state police complaints authority. One Kishore Para from Guntur contended the government made the appointment in contravention of rules. Kishore said as per rules, a retired judge can be appointed as chairman of the authority for a period of three years or till he attains the age of 65 years. Justice Kanagaraj is 78 years old, which is against the rules, he argued. The petitioner further contended that the appointment is against the spirit and intent of the Supreme Court which has given a slew of directions on appointments to complaints authority. The intent of the apex court is to insulate police machinery from political and executive influence and to strengthen and preserve the rule of law, he said, adding that the state government has watered down the intention of the apex court in appointing Justice Kanagaraj as police complaints authority. He also pointed out the manner in which he was appointed as state election commissioner on the recommendation of the chief minister. The high court had struck down the appointment with a specific allegation that Justice Kanagaraj was the choice of the chief minister and free and fair election cannot be expected from such a person. The petitioner further alleged that Justice Kanagaraj was appointed to compensate his earlier appointment as SEC which was struck down by the high court. As their allegiance is a known fact, the appointment is nothing but playing fraud on power and to achieve oblique ends, he argued, and sought directions to set aside the orders issued by the state government. The high court is likely to hear the petition on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/pil-challenges-appointment-of-kanagaraj-as-police-body-chair/articleshow/86018332.cms||Srikanth Aluri

This is Voxelgrids’ first external investment and the company has received various grants totalling to around Rs 20 crore before this investment. “We have one active installation and four advance orders. We should have multiple active beta installations by the end of this financial year,” Arjun Arunachalam, founder and CEO, Voxelgrids, said. “Deep tech products like ours require a significant amount of time from completing the R&D to taking the product to market, and most often, this is the time where we face insufficient funding. The investment from Zoho will help us bridge this gap and speed up our efforts to scale,” he added. “Our mission is to invest in critical technology know-how in India. This fits very well with that mission...Voxelgrids is one of the few companies that is working to solve this problem with MRI machines entirely built in India,” Sridhar Vembu, chief exexecutive officer ( CEO) and co-founder, Zoho Corp, said. This is Zoho’s second investment in the medical tech space after medical devices company vTitan. Overall, Vembu estimates, Zoho has spent around Rs 250 cr over the years backing various deep tech companies. Without disclosing specifics, Vembu said that 3-5 years down the line Zoho may begin to see synergies in its medical tech bets and envisions “a full spectrum medical technology” play for Zoho in the long-term. “We can innovate around the software stack for the medical devices as a company and eventually plan to make this in-house,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/zoho-corp-invests-rs-35-cr-in-voxelgrids/articleshow/86019112.cms||Sindhu Hariharan
---||Business||WFH won’t be permanent, staff will return to hybrid workplace: HDFC Life||HDFC Life Insurance announced last Friday that it will acquire Exide Life Insurance for Rs 6,687 crore. Nearly 90% of the payment is being done through shares. In an interview, HDFC Life MD & CEO Vibha Padalkar explains how the deal adds value and how the most valuable private life insurer manages to remain consistent in its performance. How will you bring efficiency into Exide’s life business? It would be erroneous to see this merger from the company viewpoint because we are a very large company but in agency, we are 15%. This acquisition is aimed at diversifying our distribution for which it would have taken us much longer. Share of agency had shrunk because we wanted to focus on persistency of agents and reducing complaints all of which we got right. It would have taken us three years to grow our agency force by 40%. Their agents would be excited to have the bouquet of products that we have to offer because we are seen as a product innovator or product factory. We have technology for our agents to quickly onboard customers or allow them to offer a pre-approved sum assured to the client. We have a digital agent platform where they can do business without ever attending office. We have a Google-like tech solution using which agents can get any product-related questions. This question can be asked in regional languages and forms can be filled in regional languages. What will happen to the employees of Exide Life Insurance? With growth, opportunities will come through. For example, we hired 9,000 people last year. If we go slower on hiring once the approvals come in, we can get to the same situation where all the good talent is accommodated. There would be some retirement situation with the pandemic many people have been through life changing situations and some may choose a consultancy role. With 20,000 employees, they (Exide Life) are a fourth or a fifth of our size and there could be some natural attrition. Does this deal give HDFC Life what it was looking for in Max Life? Yes, except the scale. Max was 55-60% of our business while we are now talking about 10% of our business. But underlying opportunities are similar. Have you devised a plan for a post-pandemic work environment? The second wave saw a fair bit of turbulence on the personal front for a lot of people including our employees. But productivity wise, it has not been a problem so far. We have been right up there with our digital presence for all stakeholders whether it is board, shareholders, employees or customers. That has been moving like clockwork. We are giving employees the option to come in may be two or three days in a week and we are also hot-desking and rotating teams. I do not see people permanently working from home. It will be a hybrid (setup) when everybody will have to come into office for two or three days in a week. People need to work together for building organisational culture and conflict resolution. There is also some burnout because of online meetings whereas in the real world there are some natural breaks. Did you need to have face-to-face meetings to do this deal? Yes, absolutely. There has to be a personal connection in any deal. Like with any association, which is meant to be long-term, you have to get a sense that you’re on the same page. When the joint venture was launched, the foreign partner was this global giant Standard Life. Now you are bigger. Do you think the Indian industry has matured and does not need foreign partners? I think the industry was mature 10 years ago, there was no need for a partner except for the fact — capital. The industry is a capital guzzler and there are not many Indian promoters who are willing to put in that much capital. To put things in perspective, we never had a single secondment from Standard life. We were arm’s length from both promoters and that’s where I think it allowed us to grow. With a market valuation that is more than six times embedded value, HDFC Life is an outlier. How are you different from other companies? So this is a question for analysts really, I will attempt a couple of pointers on how we are different. We are a 100% standalone company which allows us to disrupt ourselves before others do. Second, we do not have sweetheart deals with anyone. Our parent is not our biggest distributor. Our biggest distributor HDFC Bank embraced multi-distribution in its entirety. The third point is consistency, our focus never kept alternating between topline and profits, it was to stay relevant and grow profitably within the requisite of robust risk management. The last point is strategy, we are clear that we address mortality, morbidity, longevity and more recently interest rate risks. We also address longevity through our pension subsidiary, which has crossed Rs 20,000 crore of assets last month. In the past a surge in market used to see a surge in ULIP schemes? Are you witnessing that now? What has helped us during the years of volatility that the industry witnessed was a balanced product mix. In September 2010, when the new norms for ULIP came we were able to survive that better than some of the others. We believe in maintaining a balance. This is why we also cap how much Sanchay Plus an agent brings in. Sanchay Plus is typically 30% percent of bodies. Why do you want to reduce dependence on banks when everyone is seeing bank channel as key to growth? It’s not that we do not want bancassurance to grow. It is about balance. Bancassurance will continue to grow at a good clip of 20-25%. You will not find a product segment that is 80% of our business similarly with our distribution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/wfh-wont-be-permanent-staff-will-return-to-hybrid-workplace-hdfc-life/articleshow/86011179.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Patna||VTR likely to get vulture conservation centre soon||PATNA: The Valmiki Tiger Reserve (VTR) in West Champaran district is likely to set up a vulture conservation centre soon with a view to saving the endangered natural scavengers from extinction in the region. A proposal to this effect has already been sent to the state government and the Integrated Development of Wildlife Habitats. VTR’s field director and wildlife conservator, H K Rai, told this newspaper, “Vultures have already been declared highly endangered species. If necessary measures are not initiated, they will soon become extinct. We have, therefore, chalked out a plan for their conservation and protection.” Rai pointed out that the officials of the forest department had spotted these winged scavengers in Madanpur, Gonauli, Harnatand, and Bhikhnathori areas of the VTR. “We are planning to increase the number of vultures by creating an atmosphere conducive for their conservation and growth. We will construct watchtowers at different locations and create awareness among the locals,” he added. A vulture conservation centre established at the Jim Corbett National Park in Uttarakhand has had considerable success in protecting vultures and raising their population. Rai said, “We want to develop a similar vulture conservation centre at the VTR. We will deploy vulture trackers and create water harvesting structures at strategic locations.” The head of the zoology department in Patna University, Arbind Kumar, hailed the VTR officials’ proposal for setting up a centre which would “go a long way in protecting vultures and maintaining the ecological balance”. “Vultures act as nature’s garbage collectors and keep the environment clean. They also play a significant role in keeping wildlife diseases in check,” he claimed. Kumar also pointed out that the population of vultures had dwindled considerably in recent years due to poisoning from diclofenac, a non-steroidal drug, and loss of natural habitats. He added, “Recently, the Union ministry of environment, forest, and climate change had launched an action plan for the conservation of vultures all over the country.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/vtr-likely-to-get-vulture-conservation-centre-soon/articleshow/86018778.cms||B K Mishra

Meetings have been held by different MLAs in Walled City but no decision has been taken affecting the functioning of the civic body. The reason for not forming committees is that eight independent councillors supporting the Congress board in JMC-Heritage have demanded chairman posts in the committees. A source said, “It is not possible to give eight positions of chairmen to independent candidates in working committees. If they take back their support, the board may fall. Hence, we are trying to delay the decision as much as we can.” Another tussle is between the MLAs in the Heritage city. Ameen Kagzi, Pratap Singh Khachariyawas, Mahesh Joshi and Rafiq Khan are facing issues of dividing working committees amongst themselves. As per sources, all of them want powerful committees to be given to their supporters. Sources said, JMC-Heritage deputy mayor Aslam Faruqqi is from Mahesh Joshi’s assembly constituency as both Ameen Kagzi and Rafiq Khan refused to let any minority candidate from their constituency become deputy mayor. Hence, Joshi took the risk, even though there are thousands of minority community people living in his constituency and Faruqqi may become a threat to his seat in the coming election. So, now Mahesh Joshi wants powerful committees like building planning, fire committee or finance to be given to his supporters. Other MLAs are still objecting to this and want their share. Although various meetings have been organised regarding this, but no solution has been achieved. A senior JMC-Heritage official said that working committees need to be formed as lots of work will get divided and this will ease the situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/civic-body-without-working-panels-due-to-internal-strife/articleshow/86021530.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The central team, which made an aerial survey of some of the 16 flood-affected districts, including Darbhanga and Bhagalpur, in the last two days, will make its own assessment of the extent of the damage before comparing it with the details submitted by the state government to reach at the amount of money that could be given to the state as central assistance. On Monday, the team made an aerial survey of the flood-affected parts of Sitamarhi, Sheohar, Muzaffarpur and Darbhanga districts. Later, it took stock of the situation with the DMs of Darbhanga, Muzaffarpur and Sitamarhi at Darbhanga. Similarly, it also made an aerial survey of the flood-affected parts in the districts along the Gangetic stream up to Bhagalpur district, besides holding discussions with the Bhagalpur DM. Later, the team went to Nagachhia on the northern side of the Ganga by road before returning to Patna for a high-level meeting, where the state government presented the details of the estimated damage. The maximum damage worth Rs 1,469 crore has been suffered by the water resources department (WRD) whose Ismailpur-Bindtoli embankment in northern Bhagalpur, besides minor bunds at Dagmara in Supaul district and long stretches of zamindari bunds in south Bihar were damaged. The department has also pointed to the erosion being caused by the rivers as floodwaters have started receding. Similarly, the rural works department has suffered damages to its rural roads worth Rs 234 crore, agriculture department Rs 661 crore, road construction department Rs 203 crore and the energy department Rs 14 crore. Several school buildings were also washed away by the floodwaters. The disaster management department has spent Rs 1,159 crore on providing gratuitous relief to flood-hit families, food to displaced people at community kitchens and other relief materials. Meanwhile, parliamentary affairs minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary told mediapersons that the central team arrived to make the assessment when the floodwaters started receding. “We fervently hope that the central team will make a justified assessment of the damage caused by the floods,” Choudhary said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/state-estimates-flood-damage-at-rs3763cr/articleshow/86019125.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Business||Get your shares next day, not after 2 days||MUMBAI: You may not have to wait for two days to see your trades reflect in your account. Come 2022, the trading (buying or selling) will show up in your demat account the next day. Sebi has decided to shorten the trade settlement cycle despite strong resistance from some stakeholders in the stock market. The regulator has initiated the process of reducing the settlement cycle to T+1 from T+2 system for all stocks in the cash segment. However, Sebi has given stock exchanges the liberty to start it on an optional basis in scrips of their choice. The change is effective January 1, 2022, a circular from the regulator said. On April 1, 2003, the Indian market had moved to the T+2 settlement cycle from T+3 cycle. Currently, most markets around the world follow the T+2 system. “Sebi has been receiving requests from various stakeholders to further shorten the settlement cycle. Based on discussions with market infrastructure institutions (MIIs — stock exchanges, clearing corporations and depositories), it has been decided to provide flexibility to stock exchanges to offer either T+1 or T+2 settlement cycle,” the circular from the regulator said. Accordingly, an exchange may offer T+1 settlement cycle on any scrip after giving a month’s notice about the change, it said. However, Sebi said that once an exchange decides to shift a scrip to T+1 cycle, it has to continue for at least six months. If it decides to switch back the scrip to T+2 cycle, it should give at least a month’s notice. Once a stock is moved to the T+1 cycle on an exchange, this will apply to all types of transactions on that bourse. It means for all trades — whether it’s a regular, small trade by a retail investor or a block deal by a large institution — settlement has to be under the T+1 cycle on the exchange. Sebi has directed all the MIIs to take necessary steps to put in place proper systems and procedures for smooth introduction of the T+1 settlement cycle. Last week, the Association of National Exchanges Members of India (Anmi) — a pan-India brokers’ body — had written to Sebi to not introduce the T+1 settlement cycle. According to Anmi, for the smooth running of such a system, there could be operational and technical challenges at several levels, including banks, brokers’ back offices, depositories and other bodies involved in the trading, settlement and post-settlement processes. Industry sources, however, said that under the T+1 cycle, tech-driven discount brokerages will be at an advantage over those that are yet to embrace technology in a big way for regular operations. Anmi is dominated by traditional brokers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/get-your-shares-next-day-not-after-2-days/articleshow/86021564.cms||---

The court had, on August 23, directed the government to clear the dues of the petitioners within two weeks. The government pleader told the court there have been discrepancies in works by some of the petitioners, due to which the government took the decision to withhold payments for works found to be faulty in vigilance inquiry. He said payments have been made to a majority of the petitioners and in some cases 20% of the amount was withheld based on vigilance inquiry. He sought two weeks to file an affidavit with all details. Rejecting his request, Justice Battu Devanand said the government cannot ask for time citing various reasons. Stating that the high court is only concerned with implementation of its orders, he directed the government to submit all details pertaining to the payments within one week and posted the matter for further hearing to September 15.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/nregs-dues-hc-warns-of-action-against-officials/articleshow/86018391.cms||Srikanth Aluri

Hindu outfits and the BJP came down heavily on the Guntur Municipal Corporation (GMC) and submitted a representation to governor Biswabhusan Harichandan. After the state government prohibited the setting up of Ganesh pandals, police have been initiating action against artisans found selling huge Ganesh idols at roadside stalls. A few artisans had put up stalls near the fever hospital at Gorantla road in Guntur city and were selling idols. Officials seized the idols and tried to shift them in a tractor used for collecting garbage. A video of activists of Hindu outfits opposing GMC officials and urging them not to place idols in the truck went viral on social media. BJP workers, along with Hindu associations, demanded action be taken against municipal authorities. Former AP BJP president Kanna Lakshminarayana, speaking to the media, said, “Police and municipal authorities are destroying the idols and insulting Hindus by carrying the idols in trucks that collect trash and garbage. We urged the governor to intervene,” Kanna said. Meanwhile, GMC commissioner C Anuradha suspended the sanitary supervisors who shifted the idols. “The sanitary supervisors shifted idols after receiving complaints from fever hospital authorities. But, they did not consult or inform higher officials. We suspended them and ordered an inquiry,” Anuradha said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/row-erupts-after-civic-officials-shift-ganesh-idols-in-garbage-truck/articleshow/86018749.cms||Venu Lanka
---||Business||Failures demand reset, but move on quickly||By Prabir JhaSuccess is what every organisation chases. And very rightly so. But while seeking success, how well prepared is it to deal with failures? Every strategy, howsoever robust, has its share of hiccups. Murphy does strike. We do fail. How firms dust off these failures and bounce back should be as important a leadership behaviour as enjoying the fruits of labour. Failing is not always a bad thing. But how firms process their failures and deal with them shows their true character. As I advise firms who deal with their rebound strategy, I notice some obvious pitfalls but also some possible and effective antidotes. Not all need some big consulting offensive. They need resolve, self-belief and some Heliotropic leadership… Failure is always relative To each leadership team or a company board, the definition of failure varies. As also its degree. No one likes to fail. But what is the interpretation of failure determines the response. Over-done, the responses may hurt the company as much as an under-done response. I have seen boards react variously to the impulse. Some back the management to get their act right, others just the opposite. There is no absolute right, but one must always remember a single swallow does not make a summer. Think comprehensively, not impulsively, before making a choice. Throwing the baby out with the bath water may seem to be a more emotive than a rational response. Celebrate vulnerability A culture of accepting mistakes helps companies bounce back. Taking responsibility rather than pointing fingers creates the psychological safety that enables a team to critique more effectively and get its act together. It allows then a failure to be the springboard of unimagined success. It helps remove blind spots and prevent tunnel vision. It prevents learned helplessness. It allows catharsis, but allows newer ideas and novel solutions. In the moment, it looks impossible to practise. But demonstrated right, this can turbocharge a very substantive recovery. After all, when you want to grow, it is ok to fail the odd time. Reset the paradigm Every failure demands a reset. It does need an honest assessment of why there was one. The explicit and the implicit — culture, collaboration, talent, leadership — are both key to understand. But the focus must then shift to visualising a new future with specific and integrated steps for action. It is about integrative thinking, and prioritisation. It is about some definitive systemic calls. It is about some strong repudiations as it is about some sharp introductions. Redemption from failure needs all hands to effectively align and prioritise their thinking and doing. This is not always easy. But in the process, the organisation will emerge much stronger. Remember, just because it had not failed earlier does not mean things were all great. Many times, a break point has its roots in the past. Build your optimism quotient (OQ) I had written a full piece on it earlier. It important, however, to bring the concept back here. How quickly and smartly does the firm learn the lessons from the failure depends on its OQ. It helps create cultures that enable failures to lead to growth, rather than a permanent defeat. Teams then think of enablers, not obstacles. They positively question their fears. They believe better in the value of a shared destiny. They tend to be more open to ideas, be more creative and more mindful of emotions. They focus more on the solutions than the problems. They don’t cling on to a past — they create a new future. They take the accountability to rebuild and move on. Shift the mood Failures do trigger cynicism, fear, mistrust among various stakeholders. A fight-back strategy has to be honest and determined, but it must signal open-minded thinking and positivism. The focus must shift to the future rather than beating yourselves up. Leadership is about creating hope in despair. There is a need to create a new momentum. Times of turbulence need more Heliotropic leadership — kind, authentic, compassionate, grateful and positive. It means following through on commitments, keeping your word and being honest. They help build resilience, a new mindset. They ask more positive questions and focus on the strengths to bounce back than pummel someone who may be in the moment low on confidence. The power of storytelling can help get many examples of how the firm or its members successfully fought crucible-type failures. Powerful positive stories of small wins as part of the bounce-back must replace the gloom and doom. Failures then are often like annual health check-ups. They allow an opportunity to pause & reflect, repair & rebound. They expose the skeletons in the cupboard. They make systems more honest. They make the past look less perfect even as they make firms get more future-ready. Finally, they offer organisations an opportunity. Denied, the wallow will resume. Taken, the future can be sealed profitably.

The issue saw good demand from retail investors with the total collection from this segment at about Rs 279 crore, the company said. “The issue also saw good interest from its existing NCD investors, demonstrating continued trust and faith in the group,” the company said. The NCDs were rated ‘Acuite AA (Outlook: Negative)’ by Acuite Ratings & Research and ‘ICRA A+ (Negative)’ by ICRA. The debentures offered annual, monthly and cumulative interest options with the effective annual yield ranging between 9.09% and 9.70%, the company said. Rashesh Shah, CMD, EFSL, said that the oversubscription indicates the faith of investors from across categories in Edelweiss’s “diversified model and (investors’) appetite for high quality financial papers that offer competitive interest rates”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/edelweiss-financials-rs-400cr-ncd-offer-oversubscribed/articleshow/86032387.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Business||Generic tax notices: ITAT quashes Rs 57 lakh fine on Preity Zinta||MUMBAI: An omnibus (non-specific) notice served by the income tax (I-T) department on actress and film producer Preity Zinta for alleged “concealment of income or furnishing of inaccurate particulars of income” has been held as invalid by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT). Serving of such a notice under section 271(1)(c) is the first step in initiation of penalty proceedings. Consequently, the Mumbai bench of the tribunal, comprising president P P Bhat and accountant member Shamim Yahya, held that the penalty of Rs 57 lakh will also stand deleted. In passing its order, the ITAT relied on a full member decision of the Bombay high court and also other judicial decisions. Lately, owing to the scheme of faceless assessment and faceless penalty, the issue of omnibus notices has reared its head again. Many tax practitioners point out that the faceless penalty officers want taxpayers to furnish all documents instead of just those relating to the dispute. The notices are vague, they point out. Thus, this decision will also help the taxpayer community. The crux of the litigation was a disallowance of bank interest of Rs 1.7 crore taken for production of the film ‘Ishque in Paris’, a project that was commenced during financial year 2011-12 and concluded in 2013-14. Zinta had claimed this interest as a business deduction during the financial year 2013-14. This was denied by the I-T officer who said it pertained to an earlier year. The officer then initiated penalty proceedings for furnishing of inaccurate particulars of income. Zinta contested this action by stating that the expenses were not bogus, there was no concealment of income and details of the project were declared in the I-T return. She had also filed a copy of the term-loan letter from the bank. The commissioner (appeals) passed an order in favour of the actress, but the I-T department filed an appeal with the ITAT. However, the tax bench frowned on the practice of issuance of omnibus penalty notices by the I-T authorities. “The notice in this case also is an omnibus show-cause notice as it does not strike off or delete the inappropriate, irrelevant, not applicable portions. Such a generic notice betrays a non-application of mind. Hence, the penalty levied pursuant to such a notice is not legally binding in law,” states the order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/generic-tax-notices-itat-quashes-rs-57-lakh-fine-on-preity-zinta/articleshow/86021840.cms||Lubna Kably

SHO Amitesh Kumar and police jeep driver Md Javed have been admitted to the Chhapra Sadar hospital. The SHO suffered injuries on his head. A man, identified as Ram Mohan Singh of Mahuari village under Avtarnagar police station area in Saran, was crushed to death by a speeding truck, whose driver escaped during the raid. Singh was riding a bike. The incident took place when a joint team of police, district transport department and mining and geology department conducted a raid against illegal sand mining between Jhauwa Dhala and Mathurapur. The illegal sand miners pelted stones on the raiding team. Eyewitnesses said the SHO was hit with a hard blunt substance on his head while the driver’s hand got fractured. Both fell unconscious. Saran SP Santosh Kumar said police personnel from Doriganj, Avtarnagar and Garkha were engaged in the operation. The action against illegal sand mining will continue, he told this newspaper over phone on Tuesday. The police impounded 19 sand-laden trucks. Sand mining remains suspended in the state for three months as rivers are in spate during monsoon. Earlier, Mahua police station SHO and about a dozen police personnel in Vaishali were injured in an attack on a raiding police team at Milki village late Sunday evening. More than 30 people, including women, have been arrested in that case. Raids were still on to nab the others involved in the crime.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/sand-mafias-attack-cops-in-saran-garkha-sho-hurt/articleshow/86019419.cms||Ramashankar

However, devotees arriving at Gaya to offer ‘pindadaan’ will be allowed to perform the rituals in complete adherence to Covid guidelines. “Mela is not allowed. However, ‘pindadaan’ by individuals is not banned. People should maintain Covid-appropriate behaviour while performing the rituals,” Gaya DM Abhishek Singh said. Working president of Vishnupad Temple Management Committee (VTMC) Shambhu Lal Vitthal said, “Devotees have started coming to the Vishnupad temple since it reopened on August 26. All the standard operating procedures (SOPs) issued by the state government to prevent spread of Covid are being followed. Only 20 devotees are being allowed entry to the sanctum sanctorum of the temple at a time. Wearing mask and maintaining physical distance is mandatory for everyone.” Vitthal said although the fair would not be organized, the fortnight-long Pitripaksha period will begin from September 19. Performing ‘pindadaan’ during Pitripaksha is considered more fruitful than other days. Stakeholders like hoteliers, guesthouse owners and vendors selling puja materials and ‘prasad’ wait for Pitripaksha when there is a boom in business. “The mela was not organised last year too. The Vishnupad temple was closed and trains were also suspended due to Covid. Thus, pindadaan rituals were also not performed last year. This year, at least devotees are arriving and ‘pindadaan’ is also allowed. This is a great relief for the stakeholders who have been suffering from financial crisis. We hope the situation will improve by next year,” Vitthal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/no-pitripaksha-mela-but-pindadaan-allowed-gaya-dm/articleshow/86018609.cms||---

It may be recalled that a baby girl was found abandoned in bushes on the outskirts of Bhogapuram village at Rolugunta mandal in the district on September 2. The next day, an infant was found in bushes at Madhavadhara area in Vizag city. On Monday evening, an infant was found abandoned near a newly-constructed house at Mattam village in Vizag Agency. The three infants are undergoing treatment in various hospitals. The police said they have booked cases in all cases. No arrests have been made as yet. Cops said they are investigating the case from all angles to trace the parents of the infants. “When we find abandoned infants, we usually check with nearby government hospitals and local midwives. But in these cases, we haven’t got any leads so far,” police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/search-on-for-parents-of-abandoned-babies/articleshow/86018607.cms||---

This makes them vulnerable to personal data breach. A survey conducted by LocalCircles on how Indians store their banking credentials revealed that of the remaining two-third who did not store in their email, computer or mobile, 39% said that they have noted down the password on paper somewhere while another 29% said they have memorised their passwords. About 7% of the respondents did not respond. Interestingly, many people in the community discussions on LocalCircles also indicated how they rely on their smartphone’s ‘contact list’ to store their banking passwords and details of ATM, bank account, or email. “The biggest risk that must be highlighted is that people are storing passwords in contact lists and end up sharing it with all kinds of apps,” said Sachin Taparia, founder LocalCircles a community social media platform and pollster on governance, public and consumer interest. According to Taparia, in the community discussion some members have listed that they use secured password manager apps. Password managers are considered safe as they store passwords in a secure vault, which can be unlocked with a master password. India’s cybersecurity researchers recently identified 167 counterfeit iOS and Android apps used by hackers to steal money from people. The final question in the survey tried to know from citizens if they store one or more of their passwords (ATM, bank account, email, other online accounts, etc) in their phone’s contact list. In response, 5% said “yes, many of them”, 6% said “yes, few of them”. The survey received 24,000 responses from citizens in 393 districts of India. Of these 63% were men while 37% were women. Of the total participants, 45% were from metro/tier-1 cities, 31% were from tier-2 towns and 24% were from tier-3 towns and rural locations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/a-third-of-indians-store-passwords-in-email-mobile-or-pc/articleshow/86032343.cms||Mayur Shetty

This time, it is in Srikakulam district and the bone of contention is a small room constructed for an anganwadi at Manikyapuram village in Sabakota panchayat of Mandasa mandal. It may be recalled that both states have already locked horns over Kotia villages on the border, in Vizianagaram district. Tension prevails at the Kotia border villages as Odisha cops closed road to two villages to restrict visits of the AP officials. Though the land for the anganwadi center was within the limits of AP as per the 1959-60 records of the Survey of India, Odisha claims the site belongs to it. Odisha police arrested the husband of an anganwadi volunteer, Gurunatham, a couple of days ago. Tribal outfits and other associations have already lodged a complaint with the district administration. Kasibugga DSP Sivarami Reddy and Mandasa tahsildar Bade Papa Rao visited the village on Tuesday. According to Papa Rao, Manikyapuram village comes under AP limits as per records. But Odisha officials are claiming the area by citing 1994 records. “Authorities of Rayagada (in Odisha) should maintain patience. But their attitude is creating tension in the area,” he said. Revenue authorities have said they would bring the dispute to the notice of higher officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/anganwadi-building-sparks-fresh-border-row/articleshow/86018587.cms||Siva G

India’s seventh oldest university however, was lucky to achieve a 3.01 Cumulative Grade Points Average (CGPA) score on the four-point scale, which is a boundary for getting ‘A’ grade, as per NU officials. There are two more grades above this — ‘A+’ and ‘A++’. Anything below ‘A’ grade would have brought an embarrassment for the university and its over four lakh students, considering the fact that it would be celebrating its centenary in two years. The new rating would be valid for five years till September 2026. In the third cycle, from 2009 to 2014, the NAAC had awarded the same grade to it with 3.08 CGPA, which is an average of grade points obtained in all parameters. Even the NU officials were unsure about getting a good grade, particularly after a mock NAAC team awarded it a poor ‘B’ grade which was exclusively reported by TOI on August 31. Candidly admitting that it was “unexpected”, vice chancellor Subhash Chaudhari said their entire team worked extremely hard to remove discrepancies pointed out by the mock NAAC team after inspecting the university from August 5 to7. “After taking over the NU reins amid the coronavirus pandemic, we faced a lot of challenges as a new team. We were forced to conduct online examinations and at the same time, the self-study report (SSR) was to be submitted to NAAC. Then we needed to change that report as NAAC changed its norms. We had earlier sent them SSR from 2014 to 2019, but they wanted the data from 2015 to 2020. They have even changed the rules and made it more complicated,” said an elated VC, who was flanked by pro-VC Sanjay Dudhe and other top officials. Elaborating on what went in NU’s favour, he said their plans to structure courses, syllabus and teaching and learning in line with the proposed National Education Policy (NEP) was liked by the six-member NAAC team that visited the university from September 2 to 4. “They also applauded our online examination system and sporting facilities and well-equipped gymnasium offered to the students. They appreciated our Sericulture Department where we provide training to the rural youth and farmers. We also cleared their criteria of research activities, papers and patents. They liked our focus on online learning.” Explaining the advantages of ‘A’ grading, the VC said it would allow NU to seek funds under various heads from the government and other institutions. “We now plan to start defence related certificate and engineering courses and aim to make all our departments autonomous,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nu-retains-a-grade-on-boundary-with-3-01-cgpa/articleshow/86021581.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Its wholly owned subsidiary Amazon Pay has tied up with homegrown investment advisory services startup Kuvera to offer wealth management services to 50 million customers in India. Over the years, Amazon Pay has expanded its business in the payments and credit space in the country. The move by Amazon Pay to offer wealth management services comes within days of a similar one by Google Pay to offer fixed deposits to its customers in India. Industry observers say that the two moves by the two global giants indicate the changing landscape in the Indian financial services space where the sheer size of the market — a 1.4-billion population — is attracting the best and the biggest in the world to have a foothold. According to Amazon Pay India director Vikas Bansal, the company’s vision is to simplify lives and fulfil aspirations by solving payment and financial needs of every customer. “For our most engaged customers, growing their wealth and investments is a large need, where we think Kuvera can help our customers with their unique offering,” Bansal said. Started in 2017 and owned by Arevuk Advisory Services, Kuvera is a Sebi-registered investment adviser that provides online personal financial services and has been one of the first tech-enabled platforms that offered customers goal-based, direct plan mutual fund investing in India. More than one million customers, with over Rs 28,000 crore of combined assets, have used its platform. Amazon Pay users will soon see a wealth section that will use Kuvera’s product and technology know-how. Initially, Kuvera will “facilitate investments into mutual funds and FDs”, Gaurav Rastogi, founder & CEO, Kuvera told TOI. Other products will be added over time, he said. This is the first wealth management tie-up for Amazon anywhere in the world. Under the current arrangement, while Amazon Pay will distribute the wealth management services of Kuvera, the Indian startup’s tech-driven platform will execute and manage customers’ money, Alokik Advani, managing partner at Fidelity International Strategic Ventures, one of the investors in Kuvera, told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/in-a-first-amazon-to-offer-wealth-mgmt-service/articleshow/86021784.cms||Partha Sinha

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted fairly widespread rainfall in the state over the next two days. The IMD has also issued yellow warning for heavy rainfall at isolated places in Bihar for Wednesday and Thursday. The yellow code warning by IMD asks the authorities to be watchful for extreme weather developments. Patna meteorological centre on the other hand has also issued a forecast for heavy rainfall in north-east Bihar over the next two days. Weathermen have attributed the prevailing rainy condition to the induce effect of a low-pressure area over Bay of Bengal. “Though the low pressure has primarily affected Odisha and Chhattisgarh but several places in south Bihar also witnessed light to moderate rainfall along with windy condition on Tuesday,” Sanjay Kumar, metrereologist at Patna meteorological centre said. He, however, added that the intensity of rainfall as well wind speed is likely to reduce from Wednesday. Private weather agency Skymetweather has also reported that a low pressure area formed over north-west and adjoining west-central Bay of Bengal on Monday, which is likely to revive monsoon activity over eastern and central parts of the country. It further stated that the peripherals of the low pressure area will influence weather conditions of Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Delhi, and Uttarakhand. Meanwhile, Bihar has received 12% surplus rainfall in the monsoon season till date. As per data available on the website of IMD, Bihar has received 957.6 mm rainfall from June 1 till September 7, whereas the normal rainfall during the same period is 855.5, thus leaving a surplus of 12%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/fairly-widespread-rainfall-likely-for-next-2-days/articleshow/86019248.cms||---

While more than 22,000 crashes resulting in 10,563 deaths were reported in 2019, it came down to 19,114 with 9,250 deaths last year, thanks to lockdown. In 2021, more than 15,000 accidents have been reported till August and the road accidents analysis scheme notified recently by the transport department will help in bringing down this figure especially on national highways. “The percentage of accidents on national highways (NH) in 2019 was 37 out of the total crashes despite the fact that they comprise only 4% of the total road length. In 2020, the number of accidents on NH was 5,764. The scheme will help in understanding the factors due to which these accidents occur and ways to curb them”, said Ashwini Bagga, a road safety expert. According to the scheme, it shall be required by joint inspection team to inspect the accident site within 24 hours to carry out the scientific analysis of causes of the accident. Further, wayside amenities shall be divided into two parts - small wayside amenities (on minimum1 hectare) where basic facilities such as snacks, drinking water, toiletries, multi-use kiosks, adequate parking space etc. shall be provided at an interval of every 25 km and large wayside amenities (on a minimum of 2 hectares) having adequate parking with bathrooms, comfortable rooms, restaurants, dining stalls and other facilities provided at an interval of about 50 km. To control the traffic and to provide speedy assistance at the time of accidents, police shall establish permanent traffic aid posts (facility centres) on national and state highways in coordination with the road owning agency. Building shall be reqcuired for traffic aid post and adequate land/building shall be required to park crashed vehicles which shall be provided by the road owning agency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/road-analysis-scheme-will-help-curb-mishaps-experts/articleshow/86021536.cms||Yeshika Budhwar

Ayub was arrested last month for forging solvency certificates for his brother’s parole. Ayub, who is currently in judicial custody, had sought bail on the grounds that he has been wrongly booked in the case as he had no role in forging the solvency certificates. He stated that instead of registering an offence against the persons, who had actually forged the certificates, officials of Vadodara Central Jail gave a complaint against him. Opposing Ayub’s bail application, district government pleader Anil Desai argued that Ayub had conspired to help his brother flee by submitting fake solvency certificate. “Other accused in the case are also to be arrested and there were possibilities that if the accused would have been released, he may have tampered with evidence or helped other accused,” Desai said. The court of additional sessions judge G D Pasi upheld Desai’s argument and also took into consideration the report by jail authorities for registering an FIR to turn down Ayub’s bail plea. Salim, who has been punished with life imprisonment, was granted 21-day parole by Gujarat high court on June 16. The court had ordered to deposit Rs one lakh and a solvency certificate of the same amount to two persons within 15 days as a condition to get parole. On June 30, when the jail officials asked for the original Aadhar card of the two persons, Ayub said that the identity cards were deposited at the gate along with his mobile phone. He left to get the identity cards but never returned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/bail-of-godhra-carnage-convicts-brother-junked/articleshow/86018038.cms||---
---||Business||You can soon use debit cards without any network||MUMBAI: Debit cardholders may soon be able to request their bank for a Visa card that allows them to store up to Rs 2,000 in the chip itself, enabling transactions to take place without connectivity. A proof of concept (PoC) for the stored value card for offline payments has already been established by Visa in partnership with payment solutions firm Innoviti. The PoC has been executed in partnership with Yes Bank and Axis Bank. Stored value cards are different from prepaid cards where authorisation takes place on the network cloud. The chip in this new Visa debit card will hold a stored value of a daily spend limit of Rs 2,000 and have a per-transaction limit of Rs 200 — the limits mandated by the RBI currently. If the balance is insufficient, the transaction will be declined, making this proposition conducive for cardholders and merchants. Merchants also stand to gain revenue from reduced friction and risk of payment failures. Visa’s solution is the first of its kind and equipped to enter the Indian market. The RBI has been urging banks to come up with solutions for offline digital transactions so that these can continue to take place with poor telecom infrastructure or during network breakdowns. Digital payments are hugely dependent on mobile networks and an outage could result in major transaction failures in a region. With the deep penetration that debit cards have across India, offline payments using Visa cards is expected to facilitate the transition of payments from cash to digital. “Lack of internet connectivity has limited the democratisation of digital payment acceptance in the country, as all existing payment technologies need real-time connectivity for authentication and authorisation. Offline payments are a fast, reliable, and low-cost way of solving this problem that can change the way payments happen,” said Rajeev Agrawal, MD & CEO of Innoviti Payment Solutions, India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/you-can-soon-use-debit-cards-without-any-network/articleshow/86021695.cms||---

The rains damaged roads and standing crops in some areas, while raising water level in reservoirs in the region. Kaviti in Srikakulam district received a rainfallof 121 mm on Monday, followed by Ichhapuram (100 mm), Kanchili (74 mm), G Sigadam (61 mm), Narasannapeta (56 mm), Gara (54 mm) and Palasa (54 mm) in the district. Heavy rains in the district led to waterlogging at several places and damaged paddy and other horticulture crops across a number of mandals. Similarly, Pusapatirega, Nellimarla, Denkada, Gajapathinagaram, Mentada M Jami and Kothavalasa mandals in Vizianagaram district received heavy rainfall in the past three days. Meanwhile, poor drainage in Vizianagaram town led to extensive waterlogging. Vizag city and rural parts of Visakhapatnam district also witnessed heavy rainfall. Waterlogging led to problems for residents of Anakapalle town. Officials of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) have predicted light to moderate rainfall over some parts of northern Andhra Pradesh on Wednesday and Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/heavy-rains-disrupt-daily-life-in-north-ap/articleshow/86018430.cms||---

---||Patna||Now, BJP MLA demands a room in Bihar assembly for Hanuman Chalisa prayer||PATNA: The allotment of a room for offering namaz in the Jharkhand legislative assembly had its ripple effect in Bihar as BJP MLA from Bisfi, Hari Bhushan Thakur Bachol, on Tuesday demanded a similar arrangement on the state assembly premises for chanting the Hanuman Chalisa prayer or reading the Shrimad Bhagavad Gita by the Hindu MLAs. “Yes, I have requested for the allotment of a separate room on the premises of the (Bihar) assembly to hold Hanuman Chalisa prayer or to read the Gita by the willing Hindu MLAs in the House,” Bachol said. “In this regard, I called on the Speaker, Vijay Kumar Sinha, on Tuesday and made my demand orally. I have not made any written request in this regard, though,” he said and added that the Speaker heard his plea, but did not concede anything. Incidentally, the Jharkhand assembly Speaker has allotted a separate room on the newly-built premises for holding namaz by Muslim lawmakers on Fridays. The BJP MLAs of Jharkhand have protested against the decision of their Speaker and, alternatively, have sought the allotment of a separate room for holding the Hanuman Chalisa prayer. Curiously, the Jharkhand assembly issue had its echo in the Uttar Pradesh (UP) House, too, where Samajwadi Party MLA Irfan Solanki on Tuesday, in a written application to the Speaker, has also sought the allotment of a separate room on the House premises for namaz. The assembly elections are due in seven states, including UP, next year. The central BJP and its state unit in UP have been working in tandem devising plans to outwit the opposition parties during the assembly elections. Bachol said what had happened in the Jharkhand House was akin to “appeasement” of the Muslims. “India is a secular country, meaning all religions are equal. Our Constitution also says that constitutional institutions should treat all religions equally and there should not be discrimination against any religion,” Bachol said. Reacting to the statement of Bachol, RJD spokesman Mrityunjay Tiwari told mediapersons that the BJP has a habit of distracting people from the burning issues facing people, like price rise, controversial farm Bills, raging unemployment, tottering national economy and the national monetization pipeline (NMP) announced by the Centre to sell government assets and public sector undertakings (PSUs) to private players. “We will allot them a room to hold the Hanuman Chalisa prayer, if they really need it,” Tiwari said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/now-bjp-mla-demands-a-room-in-house-for-hanuman-chalisa-prayer/articleshow/86019598.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Deepfakes replace women on sextortion calls||AHMEDABAD: A 46-year-old businessman with a unit in Odhav recently got entrapped in a sextortion racket when he accepted a friend request sent by a beautiful woman on social media. Within two days, they exchanged phone numbers and a video call was made by the woman. “It was a 15 second video call wherein the woman uttered sweet nothings while making suggestive gestures. Within 15 minutes, I received an extortion call asking for Rs 2 lakh or else they will make the video viral. I had not indulged in any obscenity. Still, the caller kept badgering and later climbed down to Rs 50,000 to close the matter," the bizman told cyber-cell cops. Interestingly, when the cops probed into the matter, their software revealed that the woman in the said video clip was not a real woman but a deepfake created by the advanced computer imagery and technology! In fact, cops at city cyber cell officials say that the sextortionists appear to have adopted a new modus operandi – generally such calls needed a woman accomplice, but the new technology has even done away with that. The computer-generated imagery does the work for these crooks who create deepfake, while possibly voicing these virtual characters. They could also be using the video clips from porn sites for the purpose to trap the men and youth on social media. Premveer Singh, joint commissioner of police, city crime branch, confirmed that it could be virtual computer-generated women who might have been used by the cyber crooks to lure men in many sextortion rackets. "Investigation in case of cybercrime is always tricky as the accused is invisible and mostly operating from other states posing jurisdiction issues. Though challenging and marred with limitations, we are now succeeding in nabbing such criminals. We would not leave them in future also," Singh said. In another case of sextortion of a 29-year-old telecom executive recorded on video call with a woman engaging in suggestive activities after similarly accepting a friend request on social media, police probe yet again found that the woman on the call was no real woman but product of a digital deep faking. “Scamsters seem to be heavily using technology to reduce footprints of people involved in these scams which are proliferating by the day. It has been noticed that the voice of women on many videos is also digitally altered using software that converts text into audio," said a cyber cell official. It needs mention that 8-10 applications of sextortion are received by the city cyber cell police station, cyber cell of state CID (crime) and cyber police station in Ahmedabad range. The percentage of cases where the accused might be using the ‘cyber women’ could be as high as 60%, they added. “The best way to avoid such cases is not to accept friend requests from any unknown person on social media. The profile pictures too could be fakes,” said an investigator.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/deepfakes-replace-women-on-sextortion-calls/articleshow/86020397.cms||Ashish Chauhan

The women commandos would return soon after completing their eight-week rigorous training at the CRPF’s Mudkhed training centre in Maharashtra. DIG (BMP) Garima Mallik and commandant of BMP-3 stationed at Bodh Gaya, Sushil Kumar, are leaving for Maharashtra next week to bring the commandos to Bihar. All the 92 women commandos, selected for specialised training to combat terrorism, Maoist activities and organised crime, are below 30 years of age. They will be subsequently deployed in the security of VVIPs like SSG of the state police, which is responsible for the CM’s security. Sources said the trained women commandos would reach Bihar from Maharashtra on September 16. “They will subsequently be inducted into the state police force as special commandos. They are adept in jungle warfare, unarmed combat, battle obstacle assault course, VIP security, urban operation and sophisticated battle skill,” the sources added. These commandos had to spend a week in a remote jungle with a survival kit to complete their training. Besides, they have been imparted training to handle weapons like Insas, SLR, AK-47, MP-5, MP-9 and LMG. A senior police officer, who is monitoring the training, said these commandos are trained for room intervention and search operation in densely populated localities with the help of helicopters. “They have been trained to move on foot with their weapons and 12kg weight on their soldiers,” he added. Prior to being sent for specialised training, these commandos had to complete pre-course training at the BMP-5 headquarters. In all, 134 personnel from 13 battalions of the BMP, Mahila battalion and Swabhiman battalion were selected for the purpose. However, only 92 were sent for training to the CRPF training centre at Mudkhet on June 26. Of the 92 personnel, 27 are from the Swabhiman battalion and 15 from the Mahila battalion. The rest have been drawn from the other battalions of the BMP. The Bihar government, it may be recalled, has given 35% reservation to women in police services.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/92-women-commandos-to-join-state-police-force-soon/articleshow/86019221.cms||Ramashankar

About four lakh cusecs of water is being released from Sir Arthur Cotton Barrage at Dowlaiswaram into the sea and all 175 crest gates of the barrage have been lifted. Officials of the irrigation department predict that water discharge may reach six lakh by Wednesday and rise to nine lakh cusecs if the existing low pressure system brings more rainfall. The water level at Bhadrachalam has reached 34.5 feet and is likely to increase due to heavy inflows from Kaleswaram, Medigadda Barrage and Sriramsagar project (SRSP) in Telangana. Irrigation officials are releasing 3.66 lakh cusecs of water from the Polavaram project. In West Godavari district, the Yerracalva reservoir project at Konguvarigudem is receiving heavy inflows from upstream areas. An inflow of 9,000 cusecs of water is reaching the project, of which 2,000 cusecs of water are being released downstream. At Thammileru Reservoir at Nagireddygudem, about 8,000 cusecs of water is reaching the reservoir. Officials are discharging 4,000 cusecs of water downstream. — Samson Raj||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/reservoirs-see-rise-in-water-levels/articleshow/86018528.cms||Samson Raj
---||Ahmedabad||Science graduates earn 22% more, says IIM-Ahmedabad study||AHMEDABAD: ‘Would you become a doctor or an engineer?’ Toddlers across the country face this ubiquitous question just as their parents fielded it when they were young. An IIM-A study has found a solid reason behind this rather obsessive insistence of parents that their wards study science -- it found that graduating from science stream courses earn about 22% higher than their counterparts in business and humanities courses. Interestingly, it is not just a science education. Underlying factors such as better grasping of English, knowledge of computers and cognitive skills push the demand and resultant income of science students, claimed the paper. The study ‘Science Education and Labour Market Outcomes in a Developing Economy’ was recently chosen for publication in the journal Economic Inquiry. The paper is authored by Tarun Jain from IIM Ahmedabad (IIM-A), Abhiroop Mukhopadhyay from Indian Statistical Institute, Nishith Prakash from University of Connecticut, and Raghav Rakesh from Michigan State University. The study claimed that the mean annual earnings were found to be Rs 1.78 lakh from the sample size of 4,763 from across India. Out of the total, the science stream students had average annual earnings of Rs 2.24 lakh and those with humanities and business courses had Rs 1.56 lakh. The researchers also wanted to understand underlying aspects – whether it’s just the stream that earns more money. But it’s not the case. “The study also highlights the importance of complementary skills – earnings were higher for the science students when they also had English and computer skills which were valued by the employers,” said Prof Jain, a professor of economics at IIM-A. “The education policy should ensure that students from all streams are well rounded with academic knowledge, technical skills and communication skills. The combination is what employers value, not one skill in isolation.” The Gujarat statistics reveal that about 20% of the total students passing out from Class XII opt for science stream. After the grouping of subjects, the number in Group B is constantly on rise. State education experts said that with more opportunities in developing fields, the takers for science stream have increased slightly in percentage annually. They also pointed at 90% of students getting admission at IIMs being engineers and a similar trend for other professional courses in Gujarat and elsewhere.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/science-grads-earn-22-more-says-iim-a-study/articleshow/86020486.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Patna||Group-D employees of ULBs launch indefinite stir in Bihar||PATNA: The sanitation, door-to-door garbage collection and fogging services have come to a halt at all the urban local bodies (ULBs) in the state with the Group-D employees, including sanitation workers, launching an indefinite strike on Tuesday in support of their multiple demands. Around 40,000 employees of 258 ULBs in the state joined the protest under the banner of ‘Bihar Local Bodies Employees Sanyukt Sangharsh Morcha’, an association of fourth grade employees, seeking release of their pending salaries, equal pay for equal work, regularisation of services of all contractual staff, compassionate job and other nine-point charter of demands. They held demonstrations at the headquarters of the civic bodies and raised slogans against the state government for not accepting their long-pending demands. In the state capital, more than 300 sanitation workers protested at the office of Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) at Maurya Lok Complex and blamed the government for their plight. Chandra Prakash, president of the association, said the government should regularise the services of daily workers and stop outsourcing. “The government should reconsider its decision of banning appointment of group D employees in the municipal bodies. It will deprive the children of dalits and people from most backward classes of government jobs. If the services are outsourced, what is the use of giving reservation in jobs to people from backward classes?” he asked. Prakash, who is also the president of PMC Staff Union, said around 9,000 employees of the civic body joined the peaceful protest on Tuesday. “No employee littered garbage on the roads, but the garbage will soon pile up on the roads if the government fails to fulfil our demands,” he added. Principal secretary of urban development and housing department (UDHD) Anand Kishor had held discussions with the representatives of the association on September 2, but nothing happened as the department did not accept the demands of pay parity and regularisation of services of contractual employees. PMC commissioner Himanshu Sharma said only the state government would take a call on the demands of the protesting Group-D employees. “The civic body has no jurisdiction to take up these issues. The group-D employees are already getting payment on the recommendation of the Seventh Pay Commission. Though the state government is ready to look into their demands, these employees are trying to disrupt civic services,” he said. Meanwhile, the agitation has caused inconvenience to the residents of Patna at a time when rainwater has accumulated in some localities. Satakshi Sinha, a resident of Patel Nagar, said, “It is necessary to keep the surroundings clean at a time when cases of dengue and seasonal diseases are on the rise in the city. However, the sanitation workers’ agitation will make the city dirty.” Pankaj Kumar, a resident of Digha, said, “It’s okay if the garbage is not collected for a day or two. However, if the agitation prolongs, people will start dumping garbage on roads, thereby inviting several monsoon diseases.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/group-d-employees-of-ulbs-launch-indefinite-stir-in-bihar/articleshow/86018702.cms||Faryal Rumi

People passing through the area shouted at the truck driver to stop but he fled after the mishap. The victim was identified as Ravi Shankar Meena, a resident of Dausa. According to assistant sub-inspector Gajanand, Meena worked as a taxi bike driver. “One Deepak Kumar, who was riding pillion on Meena’s bike, was injured in the accident. He is undergoing treatment and has sustained multiple injuries,” he said. Deepak had booked a ride around 1pm on Tuesday from Jagatpura to Narain Singh Circle. Meena picked him from Jagatpura when near an underpass at Nandpuri, the truck rammed into the bike. “Meena got stuck under the wheels and the truck driver continued to drag him. People passing through the area were horrified at the scene and followed the truck, but the driver jumped out of the cabin and fled,” police said. Frantic calls were made to the police control room after which multiple patrol vehicles and police vans arrived at the spot. A crane was called to lift the heavy truck and Meena was taken out. He was carried to a nearby hospital near Apex Circle where doctors declared him brought dead. Deepak’s condition remains critical. Police said that Deepak works at a hotel in the city and was heading to a bus stand to catch a bus for Alwar. “The truck was heading to Jawahar Circle area when it hit the bike,” an official said, adding that Meena worked as a taxi driver in Jaipur to make a living. He had come to Jaipur from Dausa recently. Officials claimed that the accident was horrifying as Meena’s chest was torn apart under the weight of the truck. “He had no chance of survival and died on the spot. We have informed his family members to come to Jaipur so that postmortem could be conducted,” an official added. Police said that the truck driver will be arrested soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/dausa-biker-dies-after-truck-drags-him-for-over-50-mts/articleshow/86021596.cms||---

We tried to find what led to them becoming homeless and begging on streets,” he said. Police found that while some could not get any work due to physical disabilities, others were addicted to liquor and drugs. Some were even abandoned by their families. City police had identified around 2,500 beggars who were living under flyovers, or alongside roads. Dayma said some beggars were also shifted to deaddiction centres so that they could be weaned off drugs.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Rlys mulls add’l entry-exit points to CSMT near Crawford Market||Mumbai: Those commuting to the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) may soon get additional entry/exit points as minister of state for Railways, Raosaheb Danve, has directed authorities to build a deck close to Crawford Market to help decongest exiting entry points, besides decongesting D N road. Danve recently held a review meeting of the CSMT redevelopment project to be executed by the Indian Railway Station Development Corporation (IRSDC). A senior railway official said, “The deck is proposed to be constructed behind Manish Market-Haj House, and will then be linked to the existing FOBs at CSMT near Himalaya Bridge.” Nearly 5 lakh people use CSMT station, of which a sizeable number of commuters who are from Manish Market, Crawford Market and the Kalbadevi belt will benefit once this deck comes up. “They won’t have to walk all the way up to the Himalaya Bridge or the underground subway to enter CSMT,” the railway official said. Danve had called officials from the state government, Mumbai Port Trust (MBPT) and Mumbai Metropolitan Region development for the meeting as there are also plans to extend the Eastern Freeway and build Metro line 11 (Wadala-GPO). “The minister wanted holistic planning for CSMT redevelopment as other agencies, like the MMRDA, are also planning extension of the freeway and Metro. Central Railway has demanded that a ‘U’ turn, for traffic coming in and going out of the P’Dmello side of the CSMT entrance, be made part of the redevelopment project,” said the official. At the meeting, MBPT also asked the Railways and the MMRDA to share the proposed design of the plan as their land will be needed for better traffic circulation once a ‘U’ turn is incorporated in the design. Redevelopment of CSMT is likely to start this year with 10 companies successfully submitting their applications for the Rs 1,642 crore project. Around 2.5 lakh square metre space between CSMT and Byculla will be available for commercial development as a part of the CSMT redevelopment project. Of this, 1.4 lakh sqm will be available at CSMT, 80,000 sqm at Byculla and another 30,000 sqm at Wadi Bunder, sources added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rlys-mulls-addl-entry-exit-points-to-csmt-near-crawford-market/articleshow/86023292.cms||Manthank Mehta

Though the Karnataka government’s guidelines allow five days of celebrations for Ganeshotsava across the state, the Dakshina Kannada district administration has limited celebrations to three days only. There will be no permission for pandals at public places, and the festival will have to be celebrated inside temples, halls and homes, with a limited number of devotees, said deputy commissioner K V Rajendra. Meanwhile, Udupi deputy commissioner M Kurma Rao also banned gatherings during Ganeshotsava in the district. The DC appealed to people to celebrate the festival in a simple way, without processions and cultural programmes. Holding a virtual meeting of officials on Tuesday, Rao said the government guidelines need to be followed strictly, to prevent a third wave of Covid-19. “Ganeshotsava may be organised at temples, houses or in open places, with a gathering of not more than 20 people. Ganesha idols to be installed at public places and homes should be less than 4 feet and 2 feet in height, respectively. Organisers should possess RT-PCR negative reports, and they should be vaccinated. They should ensure that people follow social distancing and wear masks. Devotees should be allowed to enter only after thermal scanning,” the DC said. Restrictions for darshan at Kukke temple Devotees will be allowed to have darshan at Kukke Sri Subrahmanya temple and Sri Kshetra Dharmastala between 7am and 7pm during weekdays. Meanwhile, darshan will not be allowed during weekends, a circular issued by the Dakshina Kannada district administration stated. Deputy commissioner K V Rajendra said that devotees will not be allowed to have darshan on Saturdays and Sundays, till further orders. “Though the Covid-19 test positivity rate in Dakshina Kannada is diminishing, restrictions are in place in view of the possibilities of a third wave. Devotees should strictly follow Covid-appropriate behaviour at temples during weekdays. Temples will not distribute thirtha prasada and anna prasada. Devotees will not be allowed to stay in guest houses of the temples during weekends, and only temple staff will be allowed to perform rituals,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/ganeshotsava-to-be-observed-in-low-key-manner-along-coast/articleshow/86017033.cms||---

Khachariyawas said though toll tax was increasing, national highways were getting dilapidated due to lack of repairs. He said recently toll tax was increased on Shahjahanpur, Manoharpur and Daulatpura toll gates on Jaipur-Delhi National Highway, but proper repair of the highway was not being done by the service provider company.

---||Nagpur||No decision on restrictions by cabinet or CM as of now: Vijay Wadettiwar||NAGPUR: A day after cabinet minister and Nagpur guardian minister Nitin Raut said Covid curbs will be re-imposed in the district due to rise in cases, other cabinet ministers said no decision on increasing restrictions has been taken as of now. Health Minister Rajesh Tope said the guardian minister of Nagpur may have made a statement after reviewing the situation, but there is no proposal to increase restrictions in the state at the moment. “We are keeping close watch to study where cases are increasing, how much and the reason behind the surge. Also, a final decision will be taken by the CM,” said Tope. He also said it was decided earlier that restrictions will be reimposed once oxygen consumption crosses 700MT. Relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar also said in Nagpur on Tuesday ‘no decision has been made, neither any discussion taken place on cabinet level’ regarding lockdown. “As of now, there are no plans for enforcing tougher curbs in Maharashtra, that includes Nagpur. Patient numbers are increasing in Mumbai and Pune. In Nagpur, cases have just started to increase. We are closely monitoring the situation ahead of the festival season,” the minister said in his interaction with the media. He added the guardian minister had expressed possibility of putting restrictions as third wave had reached the doorstep. Wadettiwar said any decision would be taken only by the cabinet and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, after consultations with the state Covid-19 task force. “The third wave is a certainty, according to experts, and it may enter our homes if we don’t follow Covid protocols like compulsorily wearing masks and maintaining distancing. I do not know whether Raut discussed the issue with the CM before making an announcement, but most likely it would have happened,” he said. Clarifying that if restrictions were imposed, it would not be limited to Nagpur but would be in entire Maharashtra, the Brahmapuri MLA reiterated that citizens need to take precautions. “If people fail to cooperate, and Covid cases multiply, there would be no other option but to reimpose curbs, as stated by Raut.” On third wave preparations, Wadettiwar said the government had made arrangements of adequate oxygen supply and beds in all districts. “Unlike the second wave, where the entire country, including Maharashtra, was caught unawares, we have made additional preparations considering 15-20% rise in patients,” he said. On the possibility of festival season being affected due to such declarations on restrictions, the minister said people need to be aware as this disease spreads rapidly in crowds. “If festivals are not allowed, then citizens start blaming the government. Therefore, they need to celebrate it with due precautions and avoiding crowding,” he said. On the OBC reservation issue, Wadettiwar said all parties — Congress, BJP, NCP, Shiv Sena and others — were unanimous that seats for the community must be reserved. “We don’t want to end OBC reservation, which is zero currently after the Supreme Court’s verdict. We are collecting empirical data to restore it. A first step in this direction was taken after all parties reached a consensus to not allow local body polls till OBC seats are restored,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-decision-on-restrictions-by-cabinet-or-cm-as-of-now-wadettiwar/articleshow/86021679.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Now employed at an outlet in Sitabuldi, he quickly opens up, telling how he has exhausted provident fund (PF) corpus and had to pledge wife’s ornaments after running out of funds, due to the lockdowns. “When I asked for some help during the first lockdown, my employer flatly refused. I had to withdraw from PF account. Disappointed, I also left the job. The outlet I am working with now is not covered under PF as the number of workers is below 20,” he said. Shop workers TOI met said they have started getting full salary only in the last two months. Reimposing the restrictions may bring tough times again, they said. Their earnings ranged from Rs 15,000 to Rs 16,000 a month. Traders, on the other hand, question the logic behind having curbs if the number of Covid cases has only gone up marginally. After the number of new Covid cases has gone into double-digits, the district’s guardian minister Nitin Raut hinted at reimposing the restrictions. As TOI went around the markets, employees in retail outlets said they were the worst-hit. Already poorly paid, their salaries went further down due to restrictions. They said there are restrictions even on timings. Shops should be allowed to open on weekends. “If the shops are closed on Saturdays and Sundays, wages for the two days are cut. It’s a straight loss of Rs 2,000, which is too much for a person earning Rs15,000 to Rs16,000,” said Sharma, as others agreed. “I had to manage by selling vegetables during the lockdown,” said another worker, also not wanting to be named. TOI found the shops bore a deserted look. “It is because of Pola,” said traders. “Had it been some other day, you would have hardly got a place to stand,” said workers at a parking stand. Even with less customers, little adherence to Covid-appropriate behaviour was seen in these places. Each of the traders TOI met claimed their entire staff has been fully vaccinated. “What is the population of Nagpur? If some 10 to 15 persons are Covid positive, does it really warrant curbs,” said Ved Prakash Jaiswal of M/s Vedom’s store in Dharampeth. Amit Jain of M/s Milton Store across the road had a similar view saying curbs in timings will only increase crowds. BC Bhartia, national president of Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), said shops and establishments should not be singled out in the name of curbs. The restrictions should apply to all including political gatherings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/workers-see-dire-times-again-traders-question-logic/articleshow/86021716.cms||Shishir Arya
---||Agra||After mega farmers’ meet, PM to lay foundation of univ in Jat icon's name||Agra/Lucknow: Days after the Muzaffarnagar mahapanchayat of protesting farmers, which a large number of Jats from western UP attended, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will lay the foundation stone of a new state university named after Jat icon Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh in Aligarh next Tuesday. This is being seen by many as an attempt to woo the community. Nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1932, Singh “gave up his property for educational purposes, and he established a technical college at Vrindavan (Prem Mahavidyalaya) ... He traveled around the world to create awareness about the situation in Afghanistan and India,” the Nobel Prize nomination archives say. “He was primarily on an unofficial economic mission on behalf of Afghanistan, but he also wanted to expose the British brutalities in India. He called himself the servant of the powerless and weak.” Singh set up the first provisional government of India, which was a government-in-exile, at Kabul in 1915. In 1929, he leased 3.04 acre land to the Muhammadan Anglo Oriental College (now Aligarh Muslim University) at Rs 2 a year. BJP sources told TOI the move could help “with the the Jat vote". “The ongoing farmers’ agitation has alienated Jats from the party in western UP somewhat. The foundation laying ceremony could win them back,” said a BJP politician. “The Jat vote might be slipping out of our hands,” another added. Jats make up about 17% of the population in the western UP divisions of Aligarh, Agra, Saharanpur, Moradabad, Meerut and Bareilly — 136 of the state’s 403 assembly seats. The community was considered a secure support base of RLD’s Ajit Singh, a prominent Jat leader in western UP, till the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots. The tide turned after that comprehensively in favour of the BJP. In 2017, RLD got just one seat in western UP. Confirming the plan, principal secretary, PWD, Nitin Ramesh Gokarn said, “Construction of the university will take at least 24 months from the day the foundation is laid.” It will be a 115-acre campus in Lodha and Musaipur villages of Aligarh. The initial budget is of Rs 101 crore. Saffron outfits had earlier demanded that AMU be renamed after Singh, after which CM Yogi Adityanath had announced in 2019 that a state university would be set up and named after the Jat leader. The PM will also lay the foundation stone for a defence corridor in Aligarh during his visit. Yogi will take stock of preparations on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/after-mega-farmers-meet-pm-to-lay-foundation-of-univ-in-jat-icons-name/articleshow/86017084.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

He asked the administration to take stern action in such cases. He was speaking during a discussion in a general body meeting on the hawker problem late on Monday. As members condemned the knife attack by a hawker on assistant commissioner Kalpita Pimpale last week, Mhaske said often information on eviction drives was passed on to illegal vendors. On Tuesday, Pimpale was discharged from hospital and said she would continue the action against illegal activities with “renewed vigour”. In the general body meeting, the BJP asked the mayor, a Shiv Sena politician, why he had been silent so far if he was aware of the staff-hawker nexus. Some corporators informed the House that anytime they alerted the municipal teams about hawkers creating a problem in their wards, they would receive calls from the hawker association in minutes, indicating a nexus. “A majority of hawkers in Thane are migrants and don’t even have valid identity documents, but despite this they blatantly occupy prime roads in the city, causing inconvenience to residents and shopkeepers,” Mhaske said. He said there was a need to have properly demarcated areas for bona fide vendors. He said the drive against squatters would continue. Corporators from various parties said some hawkers had become millionaires and owned properties in plush complexes, including commercial galas. The mayor asked the administration to take note of it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/thane-mayor-says-staff-lets-hawkers-know-about-drive/articleshow/86023309.cms||Manoj Badgeri
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan minister Ashok Chandana blames ‘Jaichands’ for Congress loss in Jaipur zila pramukh polls||JAIPUR: Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot camp politician and youth and sports minister Ashok Chandana claimed on Tuesday that some “Jaichands sold to BJP a year ago” defeated Congress in the panchayat polls while remaining in the party. The remark by the minister, who belongs to the Gujjar community, was seen as an indirect attack on former deputy CM Sachin Pilot and his loyalist MLAs, one of whom allegedly played a key role in crossvoting in the Jaipur zila parishad election that resulted in Congress losing to BJP despite a majority on Monday. On Monday night Gehlot, too, made a veiled attack on Pilot, saying that people responsible for horse-trading in the panchayat elections were the same people who had tried to topple the state government earlier. The remark was in reference to Pilot’s revolt against his leadership in July 2020. Sachin Pilot’s supporters, meanwhile, put up a grand show of strength on his 44th birthday on Tuesday, with youths from various parts of the state thronging to the city to wish him. Pilot accepted the greetings on a podium built by the road in front of his Civil Lines bungalow, while a DJ played songs in praise of the young leader. Hoardings and posters with his pictures dotted the roads leading to his house. A group of his supporters, named "Sachin Pilot Fans Club", released a 57-second video titled "Rajasthan of My Dreams" that projected Pilot as the state’s future leader, presenting his vision for the state without any reference to the Ashok Gehlot government. The video reflected Pilot’s aspiration for a larger role in the state. Despite a Congress majority in the Jaipur zila pramukh election, the discord started after cross-voting and rebellion by two elected Congress members. Sports minister Chandna said the Congress high command and the CM welcomed these people back a year ago under a "forget and forgive" policy. "Even after that if such fraud happens with the party, then the complaint will definitely go up to the top. If the high command had forgiven them, now action could also be taken against them. These people are working to finish off Congress by staying inside the party. It is now in front of the public. In politics, the dead are not buried," the minister said. Party state president and school education minister Govind Singh Dotasra, too, blamed the loss on sabotage by its own leaders and promised strong action against them. According to party leaders, both zila parishad members who rebelled in the Jaipur zila parishad election were given tickets at the behest of Congress MLA Ved Prakash Solanki, a staunch Pilot supporter. The report sent to the Congress high command has recommended action by holding Solanki accountable for crossvoting, sources said. MLA Solanki denied the allegations. He claimed that he had already informed the PCC chief of the trouble but the organisation did not do anything.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/min-blames-jaichands-for-cong-loss-in-jaipur-zila-pramukh-polls/articleshow/86021752.cms||Joychen Joseph

---||Mumbai||Covid-19: 30% of August cases and deaths covered in September 1st week in Mumbai||MUMBAI: Although Covid cases in the city dropped for the second consecutive day on Tuesday (349), the weekly graph shows a worrying increase. The case tally in the first seven days of September is 2,918 — a third of the entire tally of 9,048 in August. The daily toll has been under five on most days, yet the deaths between September 1 and 7 is also a third of the August toll of 78. In comparison, Maharashtra’s weekly case tally is 28,882, or 18.6% of August’s total of 1.5 lakh cases. The state added under-4,000 cases for the second consecutive day and fatalities have stayed below 100 for six days now. On Tuesday, 3,898 cases and 86 fatalities were reported, taking the total to 64.9 lakh and fatalities to 1,37,897. Mumbai’s case tally rose to 7.5 lakh and fatalities to 16,000 on Tuesday. Active cases in the state and the city reported a decline. The state now has 47,926 active cases, of which 4,165 are in Mumbai. Doctors and BMC officials insist it is too early to term the case rise as the beginning of the third wave. Dr Shashank Joshi, member of the task force, agreed. “We need to watch the trend for another two weeks before we can say the third wave is here,” he said. “Cases have increased in the last week, prompting us to be on alert,’’ said BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani. “We will have to be cautious at least until October 5, which would be a fortnight after the Ganpati festival ends.” The BMC is worried about Mumbaikars travelling to neighbouring districts for the festival. The present surge -- from 196 on August 17 to 495 on September 4 –- is being viewed as the result of relaxing restrictions on travel and entertainment. Health minister Rajesh Tope said the state government will be monitoring any slight surge. He cautioned the public against gathering at crowded places ahead of the Ganesh Chaturthi festival. It is not rocket science --- if there is increased crowd gathering, cases will increase. While the cases are low, the state government is trying to vaccinate as many people as it can to ensure that if a third wave was to hit the state, it would not be as severe as the second wave, said Tope. Oxygen production was still a concern as the work to instal new plants was proving time-consuming. “We have seen it in Kerala that the numbers surged post-festivities. We have experienced a similar surge last year too and so we are appealing to the public to follow all precautions during the festive season,” said Tope.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-30-of-aug-cases-and-deaths-covered-in-sept-1st-wk-in-city/articleshow/86021834.cms||Malathy Iyer

---||Mumbai||After minister Nitin Raut, Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar says 3rd Covid wave has struck||MUMBAI: A day after cabinet minister Nitin Raut said a third wave of Covid has hit Nagpur, Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar on Tuesday said the third wave is no longer on the way to the city, but is already here. Pednekar appealed to the public to celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi at home and avoid large gatherings in view of the pandemic. “I am making an appeal of ‘Mera Ghar, Mera Bappa’, meaning I will not leave him (Ganpati) and go out anywhere. I have also decided not to go anywhere as the third wave is not coming, but has rather arrived. We have seen that in Nagpur, they have already declared it (third wave),” she said. Dr Shashank Joshi, member of the state Covid task force, however, said there is no third wave in Mumbai or any part of Maharashtra at present. “What we are seeing is an extension of the second wave’s receding tail that becomes intermittently thick whenever testing is increased. The state’s total positivity rate has not crossed 5% nor has that of any district. Having said that, people must continue to wear masks,” he said, adding that even the districts of concern are showing a steady drop. Raut, who is also the Nagpur guardian minister, had said after a review on Monday new curbs like shorter shop timings would be imposed in a day or two. Other ministers contradicted him on Tuesday and said no decision on new restrictions has been taken for anywhere in the state. Health minister Rajesh Tope said: “There is no proposal under consideration by the health department or the CM at the moment to increase the restrictions, but we are keeping a close watch to study where the cases are increasing, by how much and the reasons. A final decision will be taken by the CM after taking stock of the situation.” Relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar said if restrictions are imposed, it would be for the entire state and not only in Nagpur. “As of now, there are no plans for enforcing tougher curbs…,” said Wadettiwar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-after-minister-city-mayor-says-3rd-wave-has-struck/articleshow/86021957.cms||---

---||World||Who the key figures are in new Taliban government||The Taliban on Tuesday announced key ministerial positions. Some facts about the key people: Mohammad Hasan Akhund, acting Prime Minister Akhund is the longtime head of Taliban’s powerful decision-making body Rehbari Shura, or leadership council. He was first the foreign minister and then deputy PM during the Taliban’s last rule from 1996-2001. He derives much of his prestige from his proximity to the movement’s reclusive first leader, Mullah Mohammad Omar. He hails from Kandahar, the birthplace of the Taliban. A UN sanctions report described him as a “close associate and political adviser” to Omar. He was placed on a UN Security Council sanctions list connected to the “acts and activities” of the Taliban. Akhund is highly respected within the movement, especially by its supreme leader Haibatullah Akhundzada, a Taliban source said. Some observers see Akhund, believed to be in his mid-60s and possibly older, as more of a political than a religious figure, with his control over the leadership council also giving him a say in military affairs. Abdul Ghani Baradar, first acting deputy PM Baradar was once a close friend of Mullah Omar, who gave him his nom de guerre, “Baradar” or “brother”. He served as deputy defence minister when the Taliban last ruled Afghanistan. Following the fall of the Taliban government, Baradar served as a senior military commander responsible for attacks on coalition forces, a UN sanctions notice said. He was arrested and imprisoned in Pakistan in 2010. After his release in 2018, he headed the Taliban’s political office in Doha, becoming one of the key figures in peace talks with the US. Abdul Salam Hanafi, second acting deputy PMHe was a deputy education minister in the previous Taliban regime, when they had effectively banned girls from attending schools. He was also on the UN blacklist, which was lifted to allow him to take part in peace talks with the US. After the Islamists were ousted in 2001, he was placed in charge of the Talibancontrolled northern Jawzjan province, bordering Uzbekistan. The UN Security Council has accused him of potential involvement in drug trafficking. Amir Khan Muttaqi, acting foreign ministerOriginally from Paktia, Muttaqi calls himself a resident of Helmand. He served as minister of culture and information during the previous Taliban government, as well as minister of education. Muttaqi was later sent to Qatar and was appointed a member of the peace commission and negotiation team that held talks with the US. Muttaqi is the chair of the Invitation and Guidance Commission, which during the insurgency had led efforts to get government officials and other key figures to defect. In statements and speeches while fighting raged for control of the country, he projected a moderate voice, calling on forces holed up in provincial capitals to talk to the group to avoid fighting in urban areas. He played a similar role with the province of Panjshir, calling for a peaceful settlement. Mullah Yaqoob, acting defence minister Son of the Taliban’s founder Mullah Omar, Yaqoob had originally sought to succeed his father in 2015. He stormed out of the council meeting that appointed his father’s successor, Mullah Akhtar Mansour, but was eventually reconciled. Still in his early 30s and without the long combat experience, he commands the loyalty of a section of the movement in Kandahar because of the prestige of his father’s name. He was named as overall head of the Taliban military commission last year, overseeing all military operations in Afghanistan and was one of three deputy leaders, along with Baradar and Sirajuddin Haqqani. Although considered a relative moderate by Western analysts, Taliban commanders said he was among the leaders pressing the military campaign against Afghan cities. Sirajuddin Haqqani, acting interior minister Head of the Haqqani network, Sirajuddin Haqqani succeeded as its leader following the death of his father, Jalaluddin Haqqani, in 2018. Initially backed by the US as one of the most effective anti-Soviet militia in the 1980s, the semi-autonomous group was blamed for some of the deadliest attacks on coalition forces. It is infamous for its use of suicide bombers. The network is also accused of assassinating top Afghan officials and holding kidnapped Western citizens for ransom — including US soldier Bowe Bergdahl, released in 2014. The network, whose exact status within the Taliban structure is debated, has been named a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the US. The UN Sanctions Committee also has also said the group, based in the lawless frontier areas between Afghanistan and Pakistan, has close involvement in drugs production and trade.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/who-the-key-figures-are-in-new-taliban-government/articleshow/86024861.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune court orders Virendrasinh Tawde & three other accused to be tried for terrorism||PUNE: The court of special UAPA judge SR Navander on Monday passed an order stating that charges relating to terrorism, besides murder and criminal conspiracy, among others, will be framed against Panvel-based ENT surgeon and Sanatan Sanstha activist Virendrasinh Tawde and three others in the August 20, 2013, murder of veteran rationalist Narendra Dabholkar. Sachin Andure and Sharad Kalaskar, the two men accused by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) of having shot dead Dabholkar, and Vikram Bhave, who is accused of assisting the duo in a recce of the crime spot, the escape route and related aspects, are also to be tried for terrorism. Judge Navander, however, said Mumbai lawyer Sanjeev Punalekar, who is among the five accused against whom the CBI has filed chargesheets in the case, will be tried only for the offence under Section 201 (destruction of evidence) of the IPC in view of the evidence placed on record against him. It is the CBI’s case that Punalekar had advised Kalaskar to destroy the firearms allegedly used in the murder. The actual framing of charges will be done at the next hearing on September 15, as per the court’s order. The CBI had earlier sought trial of all the five accused for charges under Section 16 (terrorism) of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), sections 302 (murder), 120-B (criminal conspiracy), 34 (common intention), 201 (destruction of evidence) of the IPC, besides, sections 3 (25), 27 (1) and 27 (3) of the Arms Act. The court said it had considered the CBI’s chargesheet comprising statement of witnesses, panchanamas and confessional statements, while passing the order. “I have heard the prosecution and the defence and decided to frame the charges as per the accusation levelled by the CBI. The evidence collected against the accused will be scrutinised at the time of the trial,” the judge said. Special public prosecutor Prakash Suryavanshi submitted that the CBI had proposed all charges against Punalekar and prayed to defer the framing of charges for two weeks, in case, the central probe agency chooses to challenge the Pune court’s order in the (Bombay) high court. The court made it clear that it can alter charges at any stage of the trial. Framing charges relating to conspiracy and murder against him (Punalekar) would be of no use if there is no evidence against him, the court observed. Defence lawyer Virendra Ichalkaranjikar, who appeared via video-conferencing mode, argued that the court should decide the bail plea of the accused before framing the charges. The court, however, made it clear that it cannot decide the bail plea as the matter was pending in the HC. After pronouncing the order, the court read out the charges to the accused, but could not proceed with the framing of charges as Tawde and Andure, who were produced via video-conferencing mode from Yerawada jail in Pune and Aurangabad jail, respectively, sought a week’s time to enable them meet and consult their family members and lawyers on the point of pleading guilty or not guilty. Bhave, who is out on bail granted by the Bombay HC, was physically present in the court while Kalaskar, who is lodged in Mumbai’s Arthur Road jail, could not be produced via video-conferencing owing to some technical issues. Punalekar appeared via video-conferencing from his Mumbai office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pune-court-orders-tawde-three-others-to-be-tried-for-terrorism/articleshow/86019607.cms||Asseem Shaikh
---||Delhi||Delhi Transport Corporation to run overage buses for three more years||NEW DELHI: Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) is the backbone of the capital’s public transport, but its fleet is depleting by the year. It is now going to engage private contractors to maintain and push its ageing warhorses to remain operational till the age of 15 years, though completing 12 years or covering a distance of 7.5 lakh km is considered the lifespan of low-floor, CNG-run buses. DTC has a fleet of 3,762 buses, out of which 2,644 were procured from Tata Motors Limited between 2007 and 2010 and are nearing end of life. As per the procurement contracts under Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, their lifespan is 12 years or 7.5 lakh km, whichever is later. However, DTC has been unable to get buses for nearly a decade primarily on the issue of annual maintenance contracts, leading to a depleting fleet every year. To tide over the shortage, it had to request State Transport Authority to allow its buses till 15 years from the date of registration. While the approval was granted, maintaining the buses beyond 12 years posed a challenge and DTC is now going to engage private contractors. The 2,644 buses are currently being maintained by Tata Motors or its service providers under comprehensive annual maintenance contracts. Out of these buses, 1,644 are under these contracts for up to 7.5 lakh km and 1,000 buses are under extended comprehensive annual maintenance contracts up to additional 1.2 lakh km of operations, or total 8.7 lakh km. Now, DTC intends to award comprehensive annual maintenance contracts for these 2,644 buses, in three distinct packages, to contractors selected through a bidding process. The contractors will be responsible for undertaking maintenance of buses, including accidental repairs, for up to 15 years from the date of registration. The 2,644 low-floor buses include 1,840 non-AC and 804 AC buses, with features like automatic transmission, air suspension, power steering, electro-pneumatically operated doors and LED destination board system. The buses, which have already completed 7.5 or 8.7 lakh km, will be handed over to the contractors immediately upon award of work. The remaining buses will be handed over when these complete 7.5 or 8.7 lakh km. As on September 30, 2021, these buses will include 58% that have been operated for less than 7.5 lakh km, 22% that have covered between 7.5 lakh and 8.1 lakh km, 18% between 8.1 lakh and 8.7 lakh km and the rest having covered more than 8.7 lakh km.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dtc-to-run-overage-buses-for-3-more-yrs/articleshow/86019669.cms||Sidharatha Roy

DS Pai, scientist and head of climate research and services, IMD, told TOI, “Our forecast for September shows that there would be good rainfall over central India in the next 7-10 days, which would help cover the rain deficiency considerably, including parts of Vidarbha.” Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather forecasting division, IMD, Pune, said around September 11, another system would form over North and adjoining central Bay of Bengal, which would further aid the rains. “September will help monsoon make up much of its deficiency. We do not see an immediate chance of monsoon withdrawal as of now,” said Kashyapi. IMD also said it had developed a Climate Vulnerability Atlas of India based on 13 meteorological disaster events. A formal inauguration for the atlas is likely to be held soon. “The atlas will identity district level vulnerabilities or districts which may be vulnerable to events like heatwave, cold wave and thunderstorm, among others, “ said Pulak Guhathakurta, head of the climate research division in IMD, Pune. He said the atlas would become a basis for impact-based forecast for each district as it gives climatological information on 13 weather hazards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/monsoon-shortfall-may-be-covered-this-month-imd/articleshow/86019622.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Clean, green, Covid-free: Vaccine mantra this festive season in Madhya Pradesh||BHOPAL: Though public opinion is divided on whether the state government should have allowed public observance of Ganesh festival, organisers of Ganesh festival suggest that there is no need to worry as they would themselves ensure that the Covid guidelines are followed in the pandals and would also utilise the occasion to give people the message to vaccinate themselves for protection from corona and work for a “clean and green Bhopal’’. Deepak Goyal of Sarafa Chowk Sri Ganesh Utsav Samiti, where the Lord Ganesh installed during Ganesh festival are revered as “Bhopal Ke Raja”, said “We are committed to observe Covid-19 guidelines. The pandal will be small according to specifications given by the administration — 30x45 feet. Since distribution of “prasad” after puja leads to crowding in the pandal, we have decided not to distribute “prasad” during this Ganesh festival.” “The idols could have been a little bigger but guidelines came late. We had ordered idols with a thought that we might have to install them in the dharmashala again, where we had installed idols during Ganesh festival last year after public festivities were not allowed on the occasion of Ganesh festival. Goyal said that usually Ganesh idols are installed at 60 to 70 sites in Bhopal but this year, the number may be less. Ajay Devnani of New Market Vyapari Mahasangh Sri Ganesh Utsav Samiti said that unlike the previous years, the pandal and tableaux would be simple and open to allow people to have darshan of the Lord straight away. “Earlier, Lord Ganesh would be installed in a temple or a cave and people would queue up to have a darshan of the Lord but not this year. The idol is 5 feet tall and made of clay. After the prayer (Arti) plants will be distributed to devouts so as to motivate them to work for “clean and green Bhopal”. Messages calling upon people to vaccinate themselves for protection from Coronavirus would also be there at the site of Ganesh festival. The organisers also hope to organise vaccination camps during one day of the festival with the help of the district administration. Masks will also be kept in the pandal for distribution and there will also be a provision of a sanitiser bottle/machine in the pandal,” said Devnani. Arun Nema of Sriram Ganesh Utsav Samiti Ibrahimpura said that celebration would mainly be limited to “puja path” and Covid-19 guidelines will be followed in letter & spirit. Prasad will be given in small packets to devotees as and when they come to avoid crowding.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/clean-green-covid-free-vax-mantra-this-festive-season/articleshow/86021958.cms||Ashutosh Shukla

---||Mumbai||Covid-19: BMC curtails all processions for Ganpati, bans physical darshan||MUMBAI: BMC on Tuesday came out with more curbs for the Ganpati festival, banning physical darshan at mandals and all gatherings besides severely curtailing processions for bringing the idols and immersion. It asked the organisers to arrange for online darshan from Friday and said only 10, preferably fully vaccinated, persons from every mandal can accompany the idol for visarjan. For household Ganpatis, only five persons are allowed. All devotees have to wear masks and observe social distancing. The same restrictions will apply for bringing Ganpati idols too. “Considering the potential danger of the Covid third wave, devotees are strictly forbidden from taking darshan. It has been decided that Ganeshotsav mandals should provide darshan facility to the devotees by cable network, website, Facebook, social media, etc,” said BMC. Earlier, the civic body had imposed height restrictions for mandal idols. On Tuesday, it said household idols also shouldn’t be over two feet tall. BMC appealed to citizens to immerse the idols in artificial ponds instead of heading to the sea or lakes. No aarti should be performed at the immersion point, it should be done earlier at home or the mandals. All mandals have been asked to refrain from stopping the vehicles carrying the idols for immersion anywhere except at the collection points set up by BMC. BMC caps height of household idols at 2ftThe BMC guidelines issued on Tuesday for Ganeshotsav not only curbed visarjan yatras, but those bringing the idols home too. “Even the process of bringing home Ganpati idols should not be in the form of a procession. There can be a maximum of five people for arrival processions too. If possible, these individuals should have taken two doses of Covid-19 vaccine and should have completed 15 days after taking the second dose. The idol should not be more than two feet high for domestic celebrations,” the BMC guidelines said. For mandals, it added: “There must not be more than 10 people in processions of Ganpati mandals. All devotees should wear masks and observe social distancing. Also, these 10 people should have taken two doses of Covid-19 vaccine and 15 days must have passed after taking the second dose. The idol should not be more than four feet high for public celebrations.” The civic body advised that domestic Ganpati idols should preferably be made of clay or, if possible, metal or marble idols in the house should be worshipped this year. Clay idols should be immersed in a bucket or drum at home, if possible. “At the time of immersion of household Ganpati, there should be no processions. If at all there is a procession, there should be a maximum of five persons for immersion. If possible, these individuals should have taken two doses of Covid-19 vaccine and 15 days must have passed after taking the second dose,” the guidelines said. Immersion of idols in containment zones should be done within the premise of the mandal or postponed. “Arrangements have to be made at home for immersion of Ganpati idols in sealed buildings. If the house/building is declared a containment zone during the festival, containment zone rules should be followed,” the BMC said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-caps-height-of-household-idols-at-2ft/articleshow/86022021.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The arrested include five autorickshaw drivers and a person known to the girl. A special court on Tuesday ordered custodial remand of all these suspects till September 16. The total number of suspects arrested in the case has reached 14 so far. Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta told TOI, “We have arrested 14 suspects, including 11 autorickshaw drivers, two class IV railway employees, and a youth known to the girl. We have arrested all the suspects on the charge of kidnapping and gang rape.” Gupta said, “The girl had visited the Pune railway station to meet the youth on the night of August 31 but he did not arrive there. An autorickshaw driver on the pretext of dropping the girl home took her to a lodge and raped her. The driver later called his 12 friends who took turns to gang rape the girl.” He said, “Investigations have revealed that after the girl was released, she reached Mumbai by train and met the youth in Dadar on September 2. The duo then boarded a train from Dadar railway station to reach Himachal Pradesh where the boy does small-time jobs. By this time, the police sent wireless message to the railway police from where the train was passing to trace them. The Chandigarh railway police found the girl and detained the boy on September 4. A team from the Wanowrie police reached there the next day and brought the duo to Pune on September 6.” “We have arrested the youth from Bihar and the five autorickshaw drivers after investigations established their role in the crime,” he added. Senior inspector Deepak Lagad said, “The suspect was aware of what had happened with the girl but he remained silent.” Deputy commissioner of police (zone V) Namrata Patil said, “The girl’s condition is stable. We have recorded her statement and will cross verify the information given by her.” Patil refused to divulge details of the statement given by the girl because of the sensitivity of the crime. Additional commissioner of police (east region) Namdeo Chavan said, “I have asked the Wanowrie police to verify if the 14 men have any criminal antecedents.” The 14 suspects have been arrested under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and Protection to Children from Sexual Offences Act.

Background check of all those working at the Pune railway station will be ensured with the help of the police.” A Pune railway division official said, “Railways and RPF personnel are on alert and over 50 CCTV cameras are an added advantage. The gang-rape of the minor is a shocking incident and more steps need to be taken to step up security. We have held talks with the RPF and are devising a fresh strategy. There will be focus on patrolling after dark at the station.” Another railway official said, “RPF personnel and a team of Saathi Railway Childline, an NGO under the women and child development ministry, patrol the station premises to keep an eye on the runaway and lonely minors. They identify such children, talk to them and try to contact their families. This year, the Pune division has rescued the highest number of such children among all divisions. Though we can’t say what is the exact reason for so many children being found at the station considering that the number was very less in 2019, the pandemic and the economic stress might be a reason.” The official said a meeting between the RPF, GRP and the Pune traffic police was held on Tuesday. “A coordinated longterm campaign will start. It will focus on action against autorickshaw drivers at the railway station without proper papers or permits. Strict actions, including confiscation of vehicles, will be taken against them,” an official said. Rohit Ranjan Dubey, coordinator of Saathi Railway Childline, said, “Our members work at the station in shifts. But since the pandemic has reduced the number of trains, one member is present at the station between10pm and 6am. Now, the plan is to talk to every child looking scared or lost at the station.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/railways-to-step-up-night-security-at-pune-station/articleshow/86019760.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Cops suspect insider’s role in Behala double murder||KOLKATA: Somebody known to the Behala double murder victims — 42-year-old Susmita Mondal and her son Tamojit Mondal (13) — was behind the incident, investigators said on Tuesday. The detective department’s homicide section has taken over the probe from the Parnasree police. Cops have registered a case of robbery along with murder after the woman’s mobile was found missing. The woman and her son were found lying on beds in separate rooms and the deep wounds that were believed to have been caused by a sharp object like knife or chopper suggested that the duo had been attacked all of a sudden and they had not resisted it. Cops have ruled out the attack by any organised gang or someone not known to them. According to the police, the teenager, a Class-VI student of a reputable English-medium school, was in uniform. As he attended his online classes on his mother’s mobile till 3pm and missed the class that started at 3.15pm, cops suspect that the crime was committed around that time. His mother’s mobile has also gone missing. The initial post-mortem report, too, suggested that the murder took place in the afternoon. Cops said that the boy had attended his classes from 11.15am on Monday. The last class he attended was the biology class, that went on from 2.15pm to 3pm. He was missing from his Hindi class that started around 3.15pm. Tamojit’s private tutor, an elderly person, had come around 5pm as per normal routine, rang the bell twice and left as none responded. The woman’s husband, Tapan Mondal, claimed that he had entered the house as the door was not locked. He, however, had a spare key as usual, said cops. Tapan has been questioned multiple times so far after cops said they were “yet to be satisfied with all his answers.” Sources said that his phone was switched off for a couple of hours in the afternoon, though Lalbazar has not confirmed this claim. Incidentally, some blood stain or clot noticed around the ring that Tapan was wearing has led cops to send it for forensic examination. A forensic team that visited the scene of crime and collected evidence suggested that the killer or killers had entered the bathroom to wash themselves after committing the murder. A detailed analysis of Tapan’s mobile has revealed a few conversations with unknown numbers that, he claimed, were official calls. Cops are trying to trace Tapan’s relatives even as they spoke to Susmita’s relatives who reside at Panrui near Shakuntala Park barely a few kilometres from her residence. Cops said they have not yet come across any major grievances that Susmita shared with them about her family. Neighbours at Senpally claimed that they had last seen Tamojit who attended the birthday party of a neighbour a day earlier. Though cops said she was a housewife, neighbours knew that she was working as a teacher. The flat, where the victims lived, is located in a dead-end street that is thickly populated. Police said none of the neighbours have heard any sound from the house to suspect anything. Local MLA and state minister Partha Chatterjee visited Senpally and spoke to the residents. “Behala is a peaceful neighbourhood. Such incidents had never been reported from this area before. I have asked police to investigate this case and put in the maximum effort to nab the accused,” said Chatterjee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-suspect-insiders-role-in-behala-double-murder/articleshow/86019723.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Chennai||Govt gets month’s time to take a call on ACB request to prosecute four officers||Bengaluru: The Karnataka high court has granted a month’s time to the sanctioning authority concerned in the government regarding the requisition sent by the Anti-Corruption Bureau seeking permission to prosecute four officers in connection with alleged illegalities and provision of preferential treatment to V K Sasikala at Central Prison (Parappana Agrahara). Sasikala, a close associate of former Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalalithaa, was convicted in the multi-crore disproportionate assets case and served her four-year term at the Bengaluru jail. A division bench comprising acting chief justice Satish Chandra Sharma and Justice Sachin Shankar Magadum said the home secretary has to appear before the court on October 8 if the needful is not done. “This court fails to understand why two months are required in the matter as all the officers are located in Bengaluru itself. The necessary orders for sanction can be obtained in a day if there is a will,” the bench observed. Earlier, counsel for ACB told the court that after preparing the final report in mid-July, a requisition for sanction to proceed against the four officers was forwarded to the government and till now nod hasn’t been granted and some clarifications have been sought. The ACB counsel sought two months as sanction is still awaited. The court is hearing a PIL filed by K S Gita, a Chennai-based educationist who claimed through the voluminous report submitted by retired IAS officer Vinay Kumar indicated preferential treatment to Sasikala, the ACB had not completed the investigation even after three years, despite having sufficient material in the case. On June 11, while disposing of the PIL, the high court had directed the ACB to submit the final report within two months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/govt-gets-months-time-to-take-a-call-on-acb-request-to-prosecute-four-officers/articleshow/86022027.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mysuru||Sindhuri & Vishwanath should join Moudgil’s probe team: Mahesh||Mysuru: Former minister and JD(S) MLA S R Mahesh on Monday questioned survey and land records commissioner Mounish Moudgil for ordering a probe into alleged land-grab charges. He said the IAS officer has joined hands with former Mysuru DC Rohini Sindhuri to target him. According to the MLA, the duo is trying to blackmail him into submission and to ensure his silence about corrupt practices. “I make it clear. Nobody can blackmail me,” he told reporters. A day after district minister ST Somashekar questioned Moudgil as to who gave him the authority to order the probe, Mahesh criticised Moudgil and asserted that he has played into the hands of Sindhuri by ordering probe into alleged land encroachment during the construction of a convention centre in Mysuru, which is owned by the legislator’s family. Referring to the probe conducted by Mysuru regional commissioner (RC) G C Prakash in June into the same issue, he said the RC probe has cleared him of the charges. Mahesh said he will welcome Moudgil with a bouquet if he comes to the site and conducts the survey himself. “Let Sindhuri also join him,” he stated reiterating that he will donate the property to the government and register it in the name of the governor if the charges are proved. He also took on former minister and BJP MLC A H Vishwanath for defending the probe. “Let him also join the team during the survey,” he stated. This comes on a day when Vishwanath said district minister Somashekar is wrong to question Moudgil for ordering the probe. “The official is trying to do his job and it is wrong to assign motives. If all is well, why is Mahesh questioning the probe,” he asked reporters. “It is wrong to question the officials for doing their job,” he added. Meanwhile, Moudgil clarified that the survey ordered for Mysuru is not a resurvey. He also pointed out that it was ordered prior to Mahesh’s press meet on an alleged scam in cloth bag purchase. “Multiple irregularities have been alleged. Despite multiple irregularities allegation in writing, inquiry ordered by the regional commissioner was on a single specific issue — whether the rajukaluve is encroached or not. All other allegations, like encroachment of Muda land, irregularities in Resort Approval in Lake Buffer Zone, etc, were not inquired,” Moudgil said. “The petitioner has been specifically asking for inquiry on all points, and not only on single point, at the behest of one person. So a comprehensive fact-finding survey over allegations of encroachment has been ordered. It’s a falsehood that survey inquiry, already completed under the directions of the RC, is being repeated,” he clarified.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/sindhuri-vishwanath-should-join-moudgils-probe-team-mahesh/articleshow/85986562.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Pawar, who is also Pune’s guardian minister, said the state government would ensure that all the arrested suspects got the strictest of punishment in the case. In a statement issued on Tuesday, the deputy chief minister said the police have already arrested eight of the 13 suspects and were acting on a war-footing to nab the remaining five suspects. “The incident is a blot on the face of humanity and the police must be more vigilant. They must ensure that there is no recurrence of such an incident in the future,” he said. Since this statement, the police managed to six more supects, including five autorickshaw drivers and a youth known to the girl, in connection with the crime. The deputy CM said since the incident also involved a couple of railway employees, the government has contacted the railway minister urgently seeking the latter’s cooperation in nipping such tendencies in the bud through apt action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/incident-a-blot-on-face-of-humanity-deputy-cm/articleshow/86019714.cms||---

---||Delhi||Unique ID code a must to register east Delhi properties||NEW DELHI: If you are planning to register property in east Delhi with the Delhi government revenue department, it would be better to first obtain a Unique Property Identification Code (UPIC) number from East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC). After the civic body approached Delhi government to incorporate UPIC among the documents required for registration to bring all property details online, an order was issued by the government to implement the proposal on a pilot basis. “All sub-registrars in areas under EDMC jurisdiction are hereby directed to use UPIC during the registration of properties on a pilot basis till further orders,” mentioned the Delhi government order signed by Akriti Sagar, deputy commissioner-II (headquarters), Delhi government, which was accessed by TOI. EDMC commissioner Vikas Anand said they would be the first in the city to implement the project. “Besides registration of property, the UPIC number will be required for mutation, obtaining licences (health, general trade, factory, veterinary trade, etc) as well as rent agreement made through the revenue department. People who are not liable to submit property tax or are not doing it intentionally will get covered from now,” he added. In the long run, the initiative would bring more people under the tax net and incorporate the details of properties, their status, etc online. Earlier, EDMC had requested the chief secretary to implement the project. The other two civic bodies had made a similar appeal. “The portal has been designed by National Informatics Centre. There is a provision for capturing the UPIC number in the software and no technical issues will arise in incorporating this detail,” said an EDMC official. Delhi government did not comment on this development. The official added, “Section 21 of the registration act provides that non-testamentary documents relating to immovable property shall not be accepted unless it contains a description of such properties and the UPIC number will facilitate this identification.” Earlier this year, EDMC had made online payment of property tax mandatory. “For paying property tax, people will need to obtain a UPIC number first. We are dispatching the UPIC number to 4.5 lakh properties,” said Anand. So far, a survey of 5.5 lakh properties has been completed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/unique-id-code-a-must-to-register-e-delhi-properties/articleshow/86019784.cms||Vibha Sharma

---||Delhi||Delhi University to declare first cutoff on October 1; to cover students taking re-test too||NEW DELHI: Candidates will have to wait till October to get an idea about their chances of securing an undergraduate berth at Delhi University. The chairman of its admission committee confirmed on Tuesday that DU would release the first cutoff list for the undergraduate courses on October 1. However, no more correction will be allowed in the registration form. Rajeev Gupta, chairman of the committee, said, “October 1 has been chosen as the first cutoff date as we want to accommodate all students who are appearing for improvement, compartment exams at the higher secondary level. Since CBSE is conducting physical exams, we wanted to give those students a chance too.” The CBSE exams end on September 16 and DU is hopeful that the results will be declared by October 1. The board has allowed students who are not happy with the online exam results to sit for the physical examinations. On reopening the portal, Gupta said, “As UG candidates have mostly filled forms under parental supervision, such correction problem doesn’t seem to have been there.” However, St Stephen’s College, a minority institute under DU, has already declared its first list. The qualified candidates will be called for interview. The college is, however, yet to release any admission schedule. The highest cutoff is for economics (H) at 99.5%. For 62 other colleges and around 70,000 seats, the cutoffs are also likely to remain high. “St Stephen’s College has already set a high benchmark, so at least in the first few lists, the cutoffs will remain high,” a college principal said. The cutoff is decided based on the number of applications and past experiences. This year, over 2 lakh candidates have applied.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/du-to-declare-first-cutoff-on-oct-1-to-cover-students-taking-re-test-too/articleshow/86019811.cms||---

---||Kolkata||New approach road set to link Sealdah with east Kolkata||KOLKATA: A meeting between the Kolkata traffic police and the railways on Monday has paved the way for a new approach road for Sealdah station that is handling around 500 passenger trains and around 10 lakh footfalls daily. A three-year-old proposal to create a link from Canal South (West) Road that will allow vehicles from EM Bypass, Beliaghata and Kankurgachi to drop passengers at the railway station is likely to see the light of the day with railways promising to call a tender for the project. Cops expect the new road to be operational from March-April next year, a few months after the East-West Metro begins its operations at Sealdah. “This road will take the pressure of the BR Singh Hospital Crossing. Private cars, cabs and taxis can drive up to the present parcel office after taking the Beliaghata Road-Canal South Road alignment and crossing the canal. We will also set up a parking lot here for private vehicles. With railways setting up a hanging garden in a portion of the VIP parking, we needed additional parking space. However, we will not allow the parking of commercial vehicles on this side,” said a senior cop from Sealdah traffic guard. Cops said the new road will help in decreasing congestion in the area. “The vehicles headed for the station from the east will not need to come anywhere near the Sealdah court. The road will also help us tackle the rising traffic load in the future. The railway authorities are developing the platform No.1 side and have proposed to set up a mall in its complex. All this will trigger a rise in the footfall of people, for which we will have to be ready,” the officer added. Cops said that a decision to shift a few of the eight auto routes originating from outside the station will be taken and an existing KMC parking lot on the Canal South Road might need to be shifted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/new-approach-road-set-to-link-sealdah-with-east-kol/articleshow/86019780.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Stray dogs still multiply like rabbits||AHMEDABAD: In December 2010, the civic body’s first stray dog census pegged the population at 2.16 lakh. The municipal commissioner at the time, I P Gautam, told a packed press conference of a plan to end the stray dog menace in 10 years. We are well past that deadline and Ahmedabad city still has 1.49 lakh stray dogs. Of them, 35,000 had not been sterilized, according to a 2019 estimate. The AMC has spent Rs 17 crore for sterilizing stray dogs since 2002. A back of the envelope calculation reveals that today a stray dog lurks behind every 45 Amdavadis. In 2010, there was a stray dog for every 28 Amdavadis and one could find a stray every 25 metres. “In the absence of sterilization during Covid in 2020, we estimate the dog population has increased by roughly 40%,” said a senior AMC official. “That means an additional population of 14,000 pups. We will have to re-strategize.” However, these numbers do not account for strays in the newly merged areas such as Ambli and Bopal. The official also admitted that internally the AMC had set a target of 2023 to complete the sterilization effort, but now that does not seem an easily achievable target. Officials said that the sterilization drive has hit several roadblocks since 2002. For instance, of the 2.5 lakh dogs sterilized, almost 1.23 lakh were dealt with between 2013 and 2017 alone. In 2007 and 2008, only 218 and 800 dogs were sterilized. “When the drive flagged, there was enough room for the dogs to multiply unchecked,” said a senior AMC official. Ahmedabad has a human population of almost 60 lakh, just one-third of Delhi’s, but it hosts 1.49 lakh stray dogs. An officer said that recently the AMC’s standing committee had appointed four agencies for the sterilization programme and has increased the remuneration from Rs 900 to Rs 930 per dog. Also, because new areas have been added to the municipal limits, the AMC has increased its budget from Rs 2.5 crore to Rs 4.5 crore so that the programme can be taken up effectively. The officials said that dumping sites and construction sites are becoming breeding grounds for stray dogs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/stray-dogs-still-multiply-like-rabbits/articleshow/86019773.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

On September 6, the education department issued an order saying that only people who have been fully vaccinated or have taken at least one dose of the Covid vaccine will be allowed to enter schools. Earlier, the department received several complaints about lack of checking for vaccination at schools. Apart from this, the education department has also received information about theft in two city schools. The district education officer said instructions have been issued to all school heads to strengthen security arrangements. Anyone who wants to enter schools must show a negative RT-PCR report taken 72 hours before coming or must be partially or fully vaccinated. Sources said a time board will be set up outside each school. Schools have been asked to maintain a record of every visitor. In addition, school staff are required to get both shots of the vaccine. Although private schools have also opened for students above the age of five, few are attending offline classes. School heads have been asked to make efforts to increase the number of students in schools.

Shiv Sena on Monday had criticised Akhtar for his comments that allegedly compared the RSS and VHP with the Taliban.

---||Delhi||Delhi HC asks ICMR to probe complaints against private labs||NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Tuesday said that Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) should examine complaints received against private pathology laboratories and revoke their licence in case of breach of conditions. ICMR gives licences to the labs and it cannot be sitting in ivory towers, the high court said. “You have to look into it. You give licences to them. The whole year has gone by. The whole nation is suffering,” Justice Najmi Waziri remarked while hearing a contempt plea against authorities for not adhering to the court’s previous direction to take action against online health service aggregators that are operating illegally and collecting samples for Covid-19 tests. Indian Council of Medical Research said that monitoring of the activities of online health service aggregators does not come under its purview. But it clarified that whenever they receive complaints against private labs, they look into it. ICMR earlier said in an affidavit that National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories certification was a must for enrolment of private labs for Covid-19 testing. As on August 16, 2021, it had approved 134 (35 government and 99 private) labs in Delhi for RT-PCR, TrueNat, CBNAAT and other M-NAT testing platforms and the information is available on its website. ICMR has laid down SOPs and standard guidance for setting up Covid-19 testing labs. Fourteen mentor institutes have been set up in India to guide the labs on implementing these SOPs and set up a testing lab. For Delhi, the mentor institute is AIIMS, it stated. The Supreme Court had last year directed that Covid-19 tests must be carried out in NABL-accredited labs or any agencies approved by WHO or ICMR. Subsequently, the high court had directed the AAP government to take action against online health service aggregators who were operating illegally without any registration and allegedly collecting samples leading to false negative Covid-19 results.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-asks-icmr-to-probe-complaints-against-private-labs/articleshow/86019849.cms||---

On Tuesday, the city received three lakh doses from the state, the highest tranche it has ever got. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said an estimated 2.5 lakh people were awaiting their second dose in the city. The first special drive to vaccinate only second dose recipients was organised on Saturday, which got a good response as 1.79 lakh beneficiaries were vaccinated. “In the last estimate taken, there were 2.66 lakh people waiting for their second dose, of which we had covered 1.79 lakh,” he said. Kakani said the second dose was given priority to prevent hospitalisations and deaths should there be a third wave. Of the three lakh doses received from the state on Tuesday, 2.95 lakh are Covishield. Insufficiency of doses caused vaccination to drop on Tuesday. After Monday’s record of 1.72 lakh doses, the number dropped to 66,201 on Tuesday.

The 30-year-old man Kajal Dafda has been arrested for killing her husband Nilesh as she was fed up of his drinking habit and domestic violence. On Monday night, she had repeatedly slit his throat with a knife while he was asleep. Earlier on Sunday too, Kajal had tried to kill Nilesh by giving him coffee mixed with pesticide. “During questioning, Kajal told police that she had purchased pesticide used in removing weeds and mixed it with coffee on Sunday evening. Nilesh drank it but it did not have the desired effect, so she slit his throat later on Monday,” Vasamsetty Ravi Teja, superintendent of police, Junagadh, told reporters on Tuesday. Kajal was formally arrested on Tuesday. The relations between the couple were strained for the last few months and Kajal was fed up with his regular drunken fracas at home. On Sunday evening, Nilesh again got drunk and quarreled with Kajal. She was unable to bear the domestic violence and went to her mother-in-law, who lives in the same area, taking along Nilesh. She told her mother-in-law about Nilesh’s behaviour. She was advised to call Nilesh’s friend Vishal to their home as he would listen to him. Kajal returned home and called Vishal. After a brief conversation, Nilesh, who was heavily drunk, slept off and Vishal left. But Kajal was still simmering with rage and decided to kill him. She took a knife and slit Nilesh's throat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/lawyers-murder-wife-had-tried-to-poison-him-too/articleshow/86017470.cms||---

After the Nemawar and Neemuch cases, there are now reports of the death of a tribal person in police custody at Bistan police station in Khargone district. And there is also the grim news of the murder of a tribal girl who was on her way to school in Balaghat district.” The former chief minister demanded a high-level probe into both the cases. “I demand from the state government that there should be a high-level investigation for both these unfortunate incidents. Strict, punitive action should be taken immediately against the culprits and all possible help should be extended to the families of the victims and they should get justice,” the Congress veteran tweeted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/tribals-are-being-oppressed-in-mp-alleges-congress/articleshow/86022098.cms||---

To avoid crowding during pandemic times, the chart has been displayed at the patient waiting area and QR code of this is being made to be linked with the PGI website. More than 500 patients come to OPDs of the Advanced Cardiac Centre (ACC) daily on the basis of tele-consultation. “We have been seeing twice the number before Covid as most are being called for follow-up after tele-consultation,” said prof Rajesh Vijayvergia, ACC, PGI. He added, “To avoid overcrowding in my OPD and save time, I have displayed the entire instructions after angioplasty for patients and the same can soon be uploaded using QR code.” Often cardiologists recommend a change in lifestyle for heart patients. “As it is not feasible to sit with a dietician and give consultation in the OPD, the chart or QR code can benefit patients. Besides adapting the same for themselves, they can educate others as well,” said Prof Rajesh. At any given OPD in the centre, most patients queue up for investigations, including ECG. A holding area has been made to minimise the rush there but no social distance has been maintained. “There are ropes which barricade the doctors’ room to avoid crowding but the same rush can be seen for investigations,” said Karan Rana, a patient waiting in the centre. Since those with hypertension and heart conditions are at risk for Covid infection, they need extra caution, feel doctors. “No one is allowed inside without masks, but we cannot manage adherence to social distancing due to the patient inflow,” said a faculty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pgi-displays-diet-chart-to-prevent-crowding/articleshow/86019822.cms||Shimona Kanwar

---||Goa||Goa government issues SOP for Ganesh Chaturthi, withdraws later||PANAJI: Hours after the state government issued a standard operating procedure (SOP) for Ganesh Chaturthi festival, it was withdrawn, considering the “sentiments of the people” and to “avoid panic”. Chief minister Pramod Sawant said that the government would not issue any new SOP, and that people should follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. The SOPs issued were those suggested by the expert committee. “Respecting the sentiments of the people, we have decided to withdraw the SOP,” Sawant said. “Chaturthi must be celebrated with full fervour while taking all the necessary precautions, given the pandemic.” Even though there is a suggestion from the expert committee, we hope that we don’t have to release new SOPs. “If Goans take precautions, there is no need to issue new SOPs. People should first take care of themselves and others,” Sawant said. In the SOP issued on Tuesday, the state prohibited priests from visiting houses for performing pooja, and restricted celebration vis-a-vis sarvajanik Ganesh utsav. The SOP stated that a maximum of five persons should attend the immersion. “Ganesh Chaturthi is a state festival, and it is celebrated in a big way in most of the houses in the state. Everyone wants a priest to visit their house to perform pooja, and people even want proper immersion of Ganesha. I appeal to all Goans to take precautions while celebrating Chaturthi, to avoid Covid spread.” Sawant said that whatever SOPs have been issued under Section 144 CrPC by the district collectors would remain in force. Sawant said that people should not gather in large numbers, and maintain social distancing. “If some family has a Covid patient in home isolation, they should take all precautions,” he said. The chief minister said that those coming from other states should be double-vaccinated, and that they should do an RT-PCR test.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-issues-chaturthi-sops-withdraws-them/articleshow/86022142.cms||---

According to the kin, the teenager has suffered a deep injury in his intestines. The CCTV footage showed that none of the onlookers came to help him. The police arrested both the accused late at night. The injured has been identified as Shivam Yadav, a Class XI student and resident of Gagandeep Colony, Bhattian Bet. His father Ashok Yadav is a labourer.Ashok said on Monday around 7.30pm, his son went out in the locality and minutes later he received a call from a resident that Shivam has been stabbed and he was severely injured. Ashok rushed to the spot and took Shivam to a hospital. The father said two scooter-borne miscreants tried to snatch Shivam’s cellphone and when he resisted and tried to run, the accused chased him. Shivam saw the main door of a house open and tried to go inside, but fell down near the door. The accused caught him and stabbed him with a knife and escaped without taking away his mobile. The entire incident has been captured in the CCTVs installed near the spot. CCTV footage shows a man standing at the crime spot did not try to intervene and passersby also did not come to Shivam’s rescue. Even when the accused were escaping, nobody tried to stop him. Ashok said, “Condition of my son is critical. His intestines have come out and he is unconscious.” Salem Tabri SHO inspector Gopal Krishan said the police have arrested Daljeet Singh of Amantran Colony and Vikas Kumar of Shimla Colony and a case under sections 379 B (2) (snatching by causing hurt), 511 (attempt to commit an offence) and 34 (act done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the IPC has been registered. SHO pays for treatment Shivam was taken to the civil hospital, where doctors referred him to Rajindra Hospital, Patiala. Assistant commissioner of police (north) Dharampal reached the civil hospital and since the victim’s condition was critical, he decided to admit him to CMCH rather than taking him to Patiala to avoid delay.Panna Lal, a relative of the victim who is also Congress sarpanch of Gagandeep Colony, said, “The family of Shivam is poor and had no money to get him treated at a private hospital. So, Salem Tabri SHO inspector Gopal Krishan deposited Rs 20,000 in the hospital after which Shivam was admitted. The ACP has also assured monetary help to the family. Besides, the residents of Gagandeep Colony have also collected Rs 30,000 to help them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/2-men-try-to-snatch-phone-of-17-year-old-stab-him/articleshow/86017475.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Heavy rain & high tide swamp city pockets; weather to improve today||KOLKATA: A heavy downpour lashed the city from 11am to noon, inundating several areas on Tuesday. A high tide in the Hooghly on Tuesday afternoon worsened the situation in the areas along the Tolly’s Nullah. Several streets in BBD Bagh also witnessed waterlogging due to the high tide as the lock gates along the Hooghly were closed. However, this low pressure system is moving away. “From Tuesday onwards, the weather will improve as far as rainfall is concerned. The temperature will also start rising,” said GK Das director (weather) at Regional Meteorological Centre Kolkata. The low pressure system will be moving over to Vidarbha, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat gradually. As a result, the rainfall in Bengal will slow down from Tuesday onwards. The rain is due to a well marked low pressure area in Chhatisgarh with a trough, which is extending from there to Bangladesh across Bengal and Orissa, bringing in rain. While all parts of south Bengal received light to moderate rain, the areas in South 24 Parganas, East and West Midnapore and Jharkhand witnessed a few spells of heavy showers. The Met office, however, is keeping a close tab on another low pressure area that is likely to form over the Bay of Bengal by September 11. The hour-long heavy rain was not consistent across Kolkata. Several areas in the city received over 30mm rain on an average in an hour. The Kolkata Municipal Corporation’s drainage network can barely pump out 10mm rain water in an hour. An anxious civic administration decided to operate all heavy- duty pumps in the major drainage pumping stations to save certain low-lying pockets from severe waterlogging as the downpour continued till late in the afternoon. Going by rainfall pattern as recorded by the KMC’s drainage pumping stations, while north Kolkata pockets like Belgachhia, Ultadanga or Maniktala received less than 30mm rainfall between 11am and noon, several south Kolkata areas such as Jodhpur Park and Kalighat received over 40mm rain during the same time. Palmer bridge drainage pumping station in Beliaghata also recorded over 40mm rainfall in an hour. A KMC sewerage and drainage department official said they were worried over the city's low lying and waterlogging-prone areas due to showers on Wednesday. “We are keeping a watch on large parts of Thanthania, Behala, Kidderpore, Garia, Jadavpur and several areas located off EM Bypass, including Madurdaha and Mukundapur. If needed, we may have to press into service portable pumps to flush out storm water from low-lying areas,” said the civic official. For the rest of the city, the KMC will keep its drainage pumping stations ready to combat waterlogging when it rains. “We have asked the executive engineers of all drainage pumping stations to keep ready all heavy-duty pumps so that they could be deployed in the event of a heavy downpour,” said a KMC drainage department official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/heavy-rain-high-tide-swamp-city-pockets-weather-to-improve-today/articleshow/86019878.cms||Saikat Ray

A huge crowd, who had arrived in tractor-trolleys, blocked the road. They threatened to block the Moradabad-Ramnagar highway if the accused were not arrested at the earliest. The security guard, Surendra Kumar (35), was heading home after night duty when he was shot at allegedly by the bike-borne assailants on Kafiyabad-Islamnagar road under Bhojpur police station on Saturday. He was taken to hospital, where he died. Moradabad police said due to the agitation, traffic remained suspended for over an hour on the road. Vidya Sagar Mishra, superintendent of police (rural areas), said, “The blockade was lifted after people were assured that all the accused associated with the case would be apprehended soon. One of the accused, Anees, has been arrested, while three — Rohit, Jitendra and Sachin -- are still at large.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 7% of admitted Covid patients got mental health issues, says SevenHills Hospital||MUMBAI: Almost 7% of patients admitted with Covid-19 developed a mental health issue—such as depression, anxiety, psychosis, post-traumatic stress disorder—which warranted counselling and treatment, a study by the civic-run SevenHills Hospital has revealed. The duration of psychiatric symptoms lingered for 4-6 months in many, underlining the need to include mental health in the scope of long Covid.  The hospital evaluated reports of 17,676 patients admitted between January and August 20. Of total admissions, 1,585 patients were referred for psychiatric evaluation by treating doctors. 1,233 (7%) were diagnosed with a mental health problem that didn’t exist earlier. Additionally, there were 219 patients with pre-existing mental health conditions. Six people succumbed from the Covid and mental ailment cohort.  Depression was the commonest psychiatric disorder found in nearly 24% of the 1,233 patients. Anxiety disorder was the second highest detected in 20% of patients, while adjustment disorder and delirium were found in 16% and 14% respectively. Patients who were found crying incessantly, those who struggled to sleep, and those who showed signs of anxiety and restlessness were referred for a psychiatric evaluation. “Simply being diagnosed with a new, life-threatening disease triggered stress and anxiety in many. That combined with the uncertainty of its outcome, risk of family members getting infected, all act as contributing factors,” said psychiatrist Dr Rashmi Joshi, associated with SevenHills since last October. Many developed symptoms soon after they set foot in the hospital, while others developed symptoms over the course of days.  Out of the 1233, 924 were relieved of symptoms after 3-4 months of follow-up and 109 before discharge. The hospital still has 200 patients coming for follow-ups in the post-Covid OPDs. “This analysis has clearly shown long Covid also can be in terms of mental health,” said Dr Balkrishna Adsul, dean of SevenHills, adding diagnosing and treating them early alongside Covid helped many to recover faster.  In the case of an 18-year-old boy, doctors were baffled with his loss of speech after he was suspected of Covid. After evaluation by ENT and neuro experts, the case was referred to the psychiatrist, who classified it as conversion disorder. “It’s a condition where one has physical symptoms of a health problem but no illness to explain it,” said Dr Joshi. The boy spoke after three days following rounds of counselling. A senior citizen, who had become hyper energetic and would barely sleep, was detected with bipolar disorder mania. With treatment, her condition improved before discharge. Dr Alka Subramanium, associate professor of psychiatry at Nair Hospital said the sequence of isolation and lockdown unmasks mental health disorders. “Almost all psychiatric conditions have a strong genetic basis and manifest when in a vulnerable situation. This could be a reason for rise of mental health problems during Covid,” she said. Dr Smita Chavan, deputy dean of SevenHills said that video calling facilitated through tabs has helped many patients to stay in touch with their families and cope with anxiety and depression.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/7-of-admitted-covid-patients-got-mental-health-issues-hosp/articleshow/86022164.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Will Pawan Kumar Bansal, Harmohan Dhawan come together after 22 years?||CHANDIGARH: Harmohan Dhawan’s Chandigarh Vikas Manch (CVM) may join hands with the Congress for the municipal corporation (MC) elections scheduled to be held in December, it is to be believed. The top leadership of the Congress is holding talks with Dhawan, said sources, hinting of more than a possibility of former MP Pawan Kumar Bansal and former Union minister Dhawan coming together after a gap of almost 22 years. Seat-sharing could derail the reunion, however. Sources said the Dhawan group is pushing for four to five seats for its candidates. The Congress does not want to cede more than two. Another condition is CVM candidates would have to contest on the Congress symbol, implying a merger. The Dhawan camp is keen to contest on its CVM ticket with outside support from the Congress. “Discussions were held in the past but nothing was finalised. In politics, parties look for alliance and a winnable combination. The party’s main aim is to win the MC polls by defeating the BJP. Congress workers are only working to ensure party’s victory,” said a senior Congress leader. A leader from the Dhawan camp admitted they were in touch with the Congress but said “these are only discussions”. “If needed, the CVM can go into the MC polls all alone. The final decision will be taken by Dhawan,” he said. Dhawan and Bansal were together in the 1999 parliament polls when Bansal had defeated BJP candidate Krishan Lal Sharma with a margin of over 5,000 votes. Differences had then cropped up between the two. Dhawan was an MP from Chandigarh constituency in 1989 from Janata Party and served as civil aviation minister in the Chandra Shekhar government cabinet. Dhawan has remained associated with various political parties such as Samajwadi Party, Indian National Lok Dal, Chandigarh Vikas Manch, Bahujan Samajwadi Party, Congress, BJP and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). Dhawan had unsuccessfully contested the 2019 Lok Sabha elections on AAP ticket. But since then, he has not been active in that party. Dhawan had launched Chandigarh Vikas Manch (CVM) and had even won four out of 20 seats in the 1996 MC polls. WHAT’S HOLDING THEM BACK Dhawan group wants four to five seats for CVM candidates in MC polls Congress is willing to cede only two seats Congress wants CVM candidates to contest the elections on its symbol; Dhawan group is not ready Uncertainty prevails over reservation of wards for Scheduled Caste and women candidates||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/will-bansal-dhawan-come-together-after-22-years/articleshow/86019895.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti
---||Bhopal||Masks slip, risk rises, and Bhopalis make lame excuses for dropping Covid guard||BHOPAL: Corona cases are on the rise once again and health experts have been repeatedly warning that the third wave of Covid-19 may hit soon, but it seems that most people in Bhopal have forgotten the importance of wearing face masks. A simple protocol that can substantially curb the spread of Covid-19 and contribute in controlling the pandemic has few takers on streets and public places. TOI team visited the New Market and Boat Club areas on Tuesday to do a reality check of Covid-19 norms being followed by people. The team found that almost 70% of the people were not wearing masks. People either carried their masks in their pockets or just left them dangling around their chin. When asked about the reason for not wearing masks, people made excuses like — “I was wearing a mask and had just removed it for drinking water.” “It’s so humid, I feel suffocated in the mask so I just removed it.” TOI spoke to a number of people including shopkeepers, elderly men, women, students and youngsters and even families with children visiting the New Market and Boat club and all were aware about the importance of masks and were carrying it with them. But they wore the masks only after the TOI raised an objection. A mobile shopkeeper Manish Gupta told TOI, “People only follow rules and protocols until there is a fear of any disease. Now the people have stopped fearing corona virus so they are not following the rules and do not wear masks. Most of the people think that their immunity has grown strong and Covid-19 will not affect them.” The TOI team found at New Market that either most shopkeepers were not wearing masks or wearing them improperly. People could be seen wearing masks below their nose or the chin, even dangling from one ear can be seen commonly. Another shopkeeper said, “Our business was badly affected by the online shopping portals and then by lockdown/Corona curfew. Now if a customer comes to our shop without wearing a mask, we just cannot tell him to go away and return after wearing a mask. It is not practical, then the customer will go to any other shop. Our shops are too small, how can we follow social distancing?” A garment shop owner said that all the rules are imposed on the shopkeepers of the New City area because here they follow the norms and abide by rules. But nothing is done against the violators in the Old City areas. An electronics shopkeeper Anil said, “Most of the people coming to our shop carry a mask with them but do not wear it. 30% people do not even carry a mask with them now. When we object, they take out their mask and wear it.” Watch Bhopal Ground Report: Reality check shows COVID-19 norms not being followed by people||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/masks-slip-risk-rises-and-bhopalis-make-lame-excuses-for-dropping-covid-guard/articleshow/86022182.cms||Sudeept Mishra
---||Goa||Last-ditch attempt to restart Goa mining fails to get SC nod||PANAJI: In a major setback to efforts aimed at resuming mining in the state, the Supreme Court on Tuesday dismissed an appeal filed by mining companies to allow them to operate leases till 2037. This fatal blow to the mining companies’ last-ditch effort to restart mining in Goa came at a time when the government is set to venture into the mining business itself, through the corporation route. With this order, the state government will have no option than to form the Goa Mining Corporation at the earliest. On July 30, the state government passed the bill in the House. It was then sent for the governor’s assent on September 1, but this hasn’t happened yet. Mining companies had claimed that the Goa, Daman and Diu (Abolition and Declaration of Mining Leases) Act, 1987, should be made applicable from 1987 instead of 1961, and under Section 8 of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 2015, the 50-year lease period would extend up to 2037. Chief minister Pramod Sawant said that both petitions of the mining companies have been dismissed by the apex court. “I will go through the order to know what exactly it (says). Beside this, the government has started the process to form the mining corporation. We will fast-track and auction mining leases and resume mining activities,” he said. The petition had been filed by Vedanta Limited and Geetabala Parulekar. In July 2021, the apex court had dismissed the review petition filed by the state government seeking to renew the operations of 88 mining leases cancelled in 2018 on the grounds of delay in filing the petition for more than 20 months, and said that the plea has no merits. In February 2018, the SC had quashed the second renewal of 88 mining leases in the state, bringing the entire industry to a halt. In 2020, the state government filed a review petition against the order. The mining companies had filed a special leave petition (SLP) in the Supreme Court after the high court of Bombay at Goa dismissed their petitions challenging the Goa, Daman and Diu (Abolition and Declaration of Mining Leases) Act, 1987. During Portuguese rule, the appellants (mining companies) were granted mining concessions, which were then converted into mining leases under the Act. The state government had also told the Supreme Court that the companies had made a representation to the mines department contending that under the amendment to Section 8A of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, they’re entitled to extend their leases to 2037, but that they would abide by the court’s order. The state had said that the mining concessions were converted into mining leases under the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Actfrom 1987, and consequently, the 50 mining leases would be extended to 2037.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/last-ditch-attempt-to-restart-goa-mining-fails-to-get-sc-nod/articleshow/86022194.cms||Murari Shetye

---||Ahmedabad||Vadodara ventilator maker aims to buy equity stake in US firm||Ahmedabad: After entering into technical collaboration with Amptron Medical, Vadodara-based Max Ventilators is now exploring the option of picking up an equity stake in the US-based company. As per initial plans, Max Ventilators aims to pick up 20-25% stake in Amptron Medical. “We have proposed to invest in Amptron Medical by acquiring equity of about 20-25%. It is at a very nascent stage presently,” said Ashok Patel, founder and CEO of Max Ventilators. He did not divulge financial details of the proposed deal. Backed by the huge demand in ventilators amid Covid-19 pandemic, Max Ventilators, a part of AB Industries, aims to about 2,000 ventilators by the end of this financial year. This is four-fold higher as compared to ventilators that the company sold in 2019-20 fiscal in pre-Covid period. Amptron and Max Ventilators recently entered into a technical collaboration under which they jointly developed a High-Flow Oxygen Therapy (HFOT) device that provides nearly 100 per cent survival chances, and also entails lower operating costs than a conventional ventilator. “Although unfortunate, while Covid was the much-needed trigger for the Indian ventilator makers to ramp up capacities in terms of quantity, the pandemic has also given a stimulus to the need and imperative for quality of these lifesaving breathing devices. Until now, Indian products were limited to having Indian certifications. This also curtailed access to international markets for their products,” said Patel. However, with this joint venture with Amptron, Max intends to go truly global in its manufacturing outlook and approach to expand our presence in developed markets, he added. Max Ventilators aims to sell about 3,000 to 4,000 HFOT and other devices jointly developed with Amptron. This strategic partnership Max aims to develop world-class lifesaving breathing machines and other medical devices according to international standards and certifications. From now onwards, Max will make products based on international technical and quality standards and therefore seek international certifications, said Patel. Furthermore, with Amptron’s R&D infrastructure and the team being entirely based in the US, their products will have US/international approvals. Even as licencing, manufacturing, and global marketing, sales, and distribution details are still being worked out in detail, under the agreement, Max retains the right to marketing, sales, and distribution for the Indian market. “We are looking forward to a long and mutually beneficial collaborative relationship between the two companies,” said Nirav Patel, CEO, Amptron Medical.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/vadodara-ventilator-maker-aims-to-buy-equity-stake-in-us-firm/articleshow/86019964.cms||---

While the one-time payment is meant for the families that have lost a member to Covid-19, the monthly pension is for orphaned children. Social welfare minister Rajendra Pal Gautam said Delhi government stood by the bereaved families. “The authorities have been directed to provide immediate financial assistance to the beneficiaries. As directed by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, the application process is being made hassle-free so that the affected families do not have to go from pillar to post,” Gautam said. “The officials conducting the on-the-spot inspection have been directed to help the families whose applications are falling short of the required documents.” The scheme has received 9,999 applications under both categories. “Out of these, 3,708 applications have been sanctioned for grant of the assistance after scrutiny,” said Gautam. The children who have lost both parents to Covid-19 or those who already did not have one of the parents and the other parent has died due to the corona infection will be provided Rs 2,500 per month till they turn 25. Eligible people can apply on the e-district portal of Delhi government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/3700-apply-for-monthly-covid-assistance/articleshow/86019945.cms||---

The syllabus slash suggestion, meant for all subjects, has been submitted to the state board. With schools being shut for over a year due to the pandemic, students, especially those in government and aided institutes, have been facing great learning difficulties. The challenge has been particularly acute for those without internet connections and smart devices as online learning is a distant thought for them. So, to reduce the burden, the committee has decided to slash the syllabuses. The syllabus reduction has been suggested for the four classes’ third summative, which comprises lessons from September to November. Chairman of the expert committee Avik Majumdar said, “We have been instructed to reduce the syllabus. Madhyamik syllabus has already been decreased. Now, we have submitted our proposal for other classes.” Students are usually given “activity tasks” every month. In the draft proposal, the committee has mentioned that the assignments should be set on the basis of the curtailed syllabuses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/proposal-to-slash-syllabus-in-vi-ix/articleshow/86019982.cms||---

Based on a national framework to be provided by the Union education ministry, history, geography and language syllabi for school students may undergo revision soon. “We have constituted committees for different levels like elementary, foundational stage, etc,” said SCERT director Nagraj Honnekeri. “There will be sub-committees formed for different subjects.”  NCERT will be giving states a broad framework to work with. As NEP has said that syllabus can have content specific to a state, we have an opportunity now to revise our syllabus to include state-related content whenever required, if found necessary by the committees.” A day earlier, chief minister and education minister Pramod Sawant had announced that different committees have been formed to review Goa’s school syllabus and make the content more state-specific and career-oriented. “The syllabus in subjects like history, geography and languages can be reviewed in view of NEP recommendations. These are the subjects which have the scope to include state-specific content. Once NCERT gives its framework, we can now customise the syllabus for our state,” said Honnekeri. The NEP states that one of the principles it is based on is to bring in ‘a respect for diversity and respect for the local context in all curriculum, pedagogy, and policy’. “This NEP aims at building a global-best education system rooted in Indian ethos,” states the document. The policy also calls for ‘an overhaul of the curriculum to make it more engaging and useful for all students’, while bringing an Indian and local context to it, to make it more easy for children to relate to and bring in an understanding of their roots.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/history-geography-language-syllabi-in-goa-may-get-state-specific-focus/articleshow/86022231.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar
---||Delhi||One ration card: Over 56k migrants benefitted so far||NEW DELHI: The implementation of One Nation, One Ration Card (ONORC) scheme in Delhi has brought relief to thousands of migrant workers hit hard by the pandemic and the subsequent lockdowns. Now, migrant workers who live in Delhi, but have ration cards from other states can obtain free rations from fair price shops. ONORC, which was implemented in July, has benefitted over 56,000 migrants till date as they have been able to take rations with Aadhaar authentication from fair price shops in the capital. According to Delhi government’s food department, in August over 40,000 such people took rations from the 2,000-odd fair price shops. In July, only around 16,000 migrants took rations. As awareness is growing, the demand for ration from such beneficiaries has been growing. “The distribution for August started from the 25th. Within 11 days of the start of distribution, 15.9 lakh (89.3%) out of 17.8 lakh ration card holders availed of foodgrains. Of this, 20.8% took foodgrains under the ONORC scheme,” said an official. In total, 65,30,208 beneficiaries out of 72,77,994 availed of food items in August. Under ONORC, 40,797 transactions took place in August. In July 16.2 lakh ration card holders availed of foodgrains through the ePoS system. A total of 67,42,646 beneficiaries out of 72,77,995 availed of foodgrains. Of this, 15.1% beneficiaries took foodgrains under the ONORC scheme. Under ONORC, 16,150 transactions took place in July. The AAP government constantly monitors ration distribution to ensure that all eligible people continue to get the foodgrains. Beneficiaries can obtain 5kg of foodgrains every month under regular entitlement, which includes 4kg wheat and 1kg rice. Regular entitlement under the AAY category is 25kg wheat, 10kg rice and 1kg sugar for each household. The cost fixed is Rs 2 per kg for wheat, Rs 3 per kg for rice and Rs 13.5 per kg for sugar. This is currently not being charged from NFS beneficiaries (including AAY beneficiaries) while obtaining rations for the months of July to November 2021. In addition to this, each beneficiary is entitled to 5kg of foodgrains each month, including 4kg wheat and 1kg rice free of cost under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana. An official said the distribution of rations under both the schemes was going on smoothly, but some teething problems had been reported. “Some fair price shops reported slow servers, slow authentication of biometrics of beneficiaries, problems in fetching data of beneficiaries from other states, and authentication failure due to connection timeout. Otherwise, the system was working fine,” added the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/one-ration-card-over-56k-migrants-benefitted-so-far/articleshow/86020024.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Delhi||Why diabetics must take care of their liver||NEW DELHI: If you have diabetes, it may be a good idea to get your liver condition examined periodically. This is because, studies show, people suffering from type-2 diabetes, especially those with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of more than 30 kg/m2, are highly likely to have liver fibrosis, a condition that can lead to cirrhosis and liver failure. Dr Anoop Misra, chairman of Fortis C-Doc, a hospital that specialises in the management of diabetes and other metabolic disorders, said they recently conducted liver ultrasonography and fibroscan, tests to assess fatty liver and fibrosis, in 250 diabetics. “Nearly 85% of the patients had grade-3 hepatic steatosis, meaning fat cells comprised more than 66% of their liver’s overall weight. Any degree of fibrosis and severe fibrosis were seen in 205 (62%) and 46 (18%) patients, respectively. It was higher in men with BMI more than 30 kg/m2 and those with more than five years of diabetes,” added Misra. An increase of one unit in BMI above 23 kg/m2 led to nearly 20 times increased risk of hepatic steatosis (accumulation of fat in the liver). The study and its results have been published in the latest issue of the journal Clinical Nutrition. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an integral component of metabolic syndrome, with insulin resistance as a central pathogenic factor. Patients with type-2 diabetes (T2DM) have insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome, the study said. “Importantly, the relationship between diabetes and NAFLD is bidirectional. When NAFLD and T2DM co-exist, the likelihood of developing non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), an aggressive form of fatty liver disease, is high. On the other hand, the presence of NAFLD increases the risk of T2DM. Furthermore, T2DM can progress to NASH, hepatic cirrhosis (irreversible scarring of the liver) and even hepatocellular carcinoma (cancer of the liver),” it added. Misra said though the association of liver disease and diabetes was known, focus was mainly on timely detection and management of complications related to the heart, kidney and eyes among diabetics. “Our study highlights the need to keep a closer watch on liver function as well. Timely intervention in the form of weight management, dietary changes and medications can help prevent serious complications,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-diabetics-must-take-care-of-their-liver/articleshow/86020035.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

The flats were constructed on 21.64 acres of CHB land, which was transferred to UT urban planning department for the ambitious Union government project. However, UT has not given equivalent land to the board despite several reminders and letters. Many letters have been sent and many meetings held since 2015, but to no avail. In a recent letter to the UT chief architect, the board stated, “The correspondence from your office asking status of earlier allotted land or earmarked, has no relevance with the present matter because the requested land is to be allotted in lieu of CHB’s land that was utilized by the UT administration for small flats.” Replying to queries of the UT chief architect, the board pointed out, “In a previous meeting, similar stand was taken by you, the undersigned (CEO of CHB) gave an example that if ‘X’ has spent some money on the directions and on behalf of ‘Y’ then subsequently ‘Y’ cannot refuse or delay reimbursement of the money on the ground that ‘X’ should first intimate how much money he is having in his purse.” The board has again requested UT chief architect to not delay the matter further and allot 21.64 acres of land to CHB in lieu of board’s land in Mauli Jagran. A senior CHB official said construction of flats began in June 2014 at a cost of Rs 250 crore under the Jawaharlal Nehru Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM). Under JNNURM, the responsibility of providing land lay with the UT administration. CHB helped UT administration but till date, UT urban planning department has not provided land in return. Nodal body for rehab coloniesCHB is the nodal body for construction of rehabilitation colonies. So far, it has built 12,736 of the 25,728 flats proposed. Of these, around 12,000 were built in Sector 38 (W), Sector 49, Dhanas, Mauli Jagran-II and Ram Darbar. The administration rehabilitates slum-dwellers after conducting a biometric survey. Colonies resettled in the last 10 years include Colony No 5, Nehru Colony, Kuldeep Colony and Mazdoor Colony.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/small-flats-handed-over-in-2015-chb-yet-to-get-21-64-acres-of-land/articleshow/86019977.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

---||Delhi||AIIMS fountain to feed on wastewater plant||NEW DELHI: New Delhi Municipal Council has initiated the process of installing a tertiary treatment plant to operate the fountain installed at a roundabout near AIIMS flyover. An NDMC official said the tender finalisation process was in the advance stage and the project was expected to become operational by November-end. This plant will improve the quality of treated wastewater so that it can be reused for fountain. “The capacity of the plant will be 30KLD and have minimum gas emission and footprint. It will use an advance technology (electrocoagulation and ionisation wastewater treatment) to make water clear and foul-free,” said the official. Electrocoagulation and ionisation consist of pair of metal sheets called electrodes that are arranged in pairs of two— anodes and cathodes. According to the process, the cathode is oxidised (loses electrons), while the water is reduced (gains electrons), which makes the wastewater better treated. The treated water will be used at the fountain 2-3 times and will then be used to irrigate the lawns. “We will not be using underground water as per the NGT guidelines and rely on fully recycled wastewater and also reuse it to help in water conservation,” said the official. The project, which was conceived long time ago, aims to construct a cascading fountain with a circumference of 90m — the largest in Delhi-NCR. It has been made around the giant steel sprouts at the lawn beneath the AIIMS flyover.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aiims-fountain-to-feed-on-wastewater-plant/articleshow/86020058.cms||Vibha Sharma

---||Goa||Now, government hikes water tariff by 5% for Goa Inc||PANAJI: Seven days after the state began supplying free water to 60% of the state’s domestic consumers, Goa Industrial Development Corporation has increased the water tariff for industrial units by 5%. GIDC on Monday informed industrial units that the rates for water supply have increased to Rs 39 per cubic meter and to Rs 78 per cubic meter for industries that use water as raw material, with retrospective effect from April. Reacting sharply to the hike in water tariffs, the Goa state industries association (GSIA) said that the government is playing vote bank politics by “looting industries to give free water to the public” in the state. In 2020, PWD increased the water tariffs for industrial units from Rs 30 to Rs 35 per cubic meter. GIDC charges an additional Rs 2 per cubic meter of water supplied. With the latest increase, PWD will charge Rs 37 per cubic meter of water. Pharmaceutical firms, packaging companies and food processing units that use water in the manufacturing process will have to pay double. “All entrepreneurs are kindly requested to take note of the same, as such the next water bill will be issued showing the increased amount with effect from April 2021 in the arrears column of the water bills,” said Aman Shetgaonkar, field manager, Tuem industrial estate. Industrial units are furious with the government, with industrialists saying that if the government cannot support entrepreneurs, it could at least stop creating new hurdles and burdens. “The chief minister, while announcing free water to consumers, said it is under the “save water to get free water” mission, but the intention of the government appears to be free water to save votes. Why supply free water if the government cannot afford it,” asked GSIA president Damodar Kochkar. The water resources department (WRD), in its revised 2021 policy, advises against providing water free of cost. “With the increase in water tariff, the industries will be forced to buy water from tanker suppliers or draw water from borewells, which in turn will deplete groundwater levels,” said Kochkar. GSIA has urged the government to show “better sense” and reduce the water tariff for industries too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/now-govt-hikes-water-tariff-by-5-for-goa-inc/articleshow/86022268.cms||---

He wanted to get rid of his debt of Rs 5 lakh, said police. His accomplice has also been arrested. The arrested men have been identified as Gopal and his friend Jitender (27), both residents of Gurgaon. On Saturday, the victim, Subhash Chandra, gave a written complaint to police alleging that he has been getting threats that he along with his nephew will be killed if he did not pay Rs 10 lakh to the criminals. Deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka) Santosh Kumar Meena said: “Several numbers and their call details were analysed and informers were deployed to track down the culprits. The team finally managed to zero in on the culprits in Gurgaon. Based on technical surveillance, a raid was conducted and the two suspects, Gopal and Jitender, were arrested.” During interrogation, Gopal said he was an employee of the complainant. “He knew his employer’s business was doing fine and therefore planned to extort money from him. To ensure that Chandra doesn’t doubt him, he roped in his friend Jitender, a DJ, promising him a share in the extorted money. Both of them then called and sent messages to the victim and demanded Rs 10 lakh as extortion money,” the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/employee-held-for-trying-to-extort-rs-10l-from-bizman-his-aide-in-net-too/articleshow/86020100.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Delhi||Plea for Kalkaji Mandir revamp: Delhi HC seeks reply||NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court has asked the state government and South Delhi Municipal Corporation to respond to a bunch of petitions on renovation, redevelopment and maintenance of the Kalkaji Mandir complex. Justice Prathiba M Singh asked both the authorities to join the proceedings on Wednesday, after it received a host of suggestions from various associations and groups involved in running and managing the temple. The court was also informed by Delhi Jal Board (DJB) that it had spent Rs 4.57 crore on improving sewer treatment inside and around the complex. The money was deposited with the board on the orders of Supreme Court earlier by various “baridaars” to repair sewer system. DJB said it had till now received Rs 4.61 crore, of which Rs 4.57 crore had already been spent on the internal sewer system inside Kalkaji Mandir complex, peripheral sewer system and on treatment of sewage. The court took note that almost all the parties invested in the matter were unanimous that the sewerage system in the area was not in a good working condition. They submitted that most of the pipelines laid were blocked, while the way the system had been laid out was unclear. “Further, at the time of the construction of the Modi Mill Flyover, the peripheral lines have been damaged/demolished. It is submitted that, in fact, there is no sewerage system in the Kalkaji Mandir despite all baridaars having deposited a substantial sum with DJB,” the court noted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/plea-for-kalkaji-mandir-revamp-hc-seeks-reply/articleshow/86020090.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Kolkata||‘Only fully vaccinated people to be let into pandal sanctum sanctorum’||Kolkata: Several Durga Puja organisers have decided to allow only fully vaccinated people into the sanctum sanctorum of pandals, where the idols are worshipped and a handful of people work in close proximity over almost a week for the elaborate preparations and the rituals for the five-day festival. “We will ensure that the priests, the women from the neighbourhood who make the preparations, a few other club members who lend a hand, dhakis, electricians and even a section of pandal decorators who are on standby, receive their second dose of vaccine at least a fortnight before the Puja starts. Most of them have already been fully vaccinated,” said Saswat Bose, who heads the Durga Puja at Hatibagan Sarbajanin and is also the secretary of Forum for Durgotsav, an umbrella organisation of organisers that has 500 members, including all popular Pujas in Kolkata and suburbs. The forum has held two camps in the city, where over 1,000 people associated with the Puja have been administered Covid vaccines. It is in discussion with the civic body to organize one more camp soon to vaccinate those who are yet to receive their second shots. “We want to ensure that the Durga Puja does not in any way get affected by Covid. Apart from allowing only fully vaccinated people into the sanctum sanctorum, even visitors who enter the pandal will undergo thermal scan. We are designing our pandal in such a way that the idols can be viewed from a distance,” said Partho Ghosh, co-founder of the forum and its past president and secretary of Sib Mandir, a top-draw Puja near Mudiali. Forum president Kajal Sarkar hopes the Covid situation would improve further and that would allow people to finally enjoy the festival after two years. “With so many people already being vaccinated, people are feeling more secure and confident to step out, unlike last year, when there was some hesitation. We will, of course, abide by the Covid safety protocol to ensure the celebration does not lead to a spike in the spread of the novel coronavirus,” said Sarkar, also the secretary of Bosepukur Sitala Mandir. While the organizers will work out a crowd-control plan during a meeting with Kolkata Police, many pujas have decided to allow a maximum of 25-30 people inside a pandal at a time to ensure adequate distancing is maintained. “No one without mask will be allowed. Also, there will be provision to sanitize hands at the entrance. The pandals will also be sanitised early in the morning,” said Sarkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/only-fully-vaccinated-people-to-be-let-into-pandal-sanctum-sanctorum/articleshow/86020129.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Retired colonel on RIL staff was first to spot car near Antilia||MUMBAI: A retired colonel, the president of a Reliance group company handling security matters, was the first to notice the abandoned vehicle outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence, Antilia, on February 25. The vehicle was subsequently found to contain a bag of gelatine sticks and a letter carrying a threat addressed to Mukesh Ambani and his wife Nita Ambani. The witness recalled that moments before discovering the vehicle, he had walked from Antilia to Carmichael Road to meet the widow of a Reliance Industries Jamnagar employee who had recently died of a heart attack. The woman was at the gate of the residence to express her grievance and demand more compensation. He said he noticed the SUV while talking to her. The 53-year-old Reliance official, a witness in the case against the 10 individuals allegedly involved in Mansukh Hiran’s murder, told the National Investigation Agency (NIA) that a clean number plate on an otherwise dusty vehicle drew his attention; the registration number, he realised, had the same last four digits as allotted to vehicles in the Ambani family’s security entourage. His team found that the vehicle had the same registration number as that of a Range Rover in the security entourage of Nita Ambani. The witness said the police were immediately informed. “Meanwhile, my team members cross-checked with neighbouring residences but nobody had any clue on who parked the vehicle,” he said. The police arrived and called the bomb detection and disposal squad. “…I was informed by the police authorities that one bag containing gelatin sticks and a threat letter to Shri Mukesh Ambani and Smt Nita Ambani, was recovered from the SUV,” the witness said. He said this was immediately conveyed to Mukesh Ambani and a scheduled trip by Nita Ambani at 4 pm from Antilia to the airport was put off and later cancelled. “On February 25, 2021, Ms Nita Ambani was to leave for Jamnagar but after this incident her programme was postponed after the advice of DCP Rajiv Jain and by me,” the witness told the NIA. The witness further said that cops informed him that the gelatin sticks were not assembled. “Earlier also Ambani family had been receiving threats from various quarters but all were related to farmers protests that began in October 2020. Ambani family does not suspect any particular person for the threat letter and gelatin sticks found in the abandoned Mahindra Scorpio,” the witness had told NIA on March 10. In a statement on February 26 to the Mumbai anti-terror squad (ATS), the agency which was earlier probing the case, the same witness had said that due to his years in the armed forces and more so in a “Counter Insurgency” wing, any suspicious object, person or movement was immediately noticed by him. “After the incident JSR was carried out by CRPF, IB and local police authorities. Security of Antilia surrounding was increased,” the witness said. He also said the Ambanis had received threats earlier. Hence, the Union government had provided CRPF security in 2013. The witness said the security at the residence and for the Ambani family is handled by a group comprising mostly retired army and paramilitary personnel who have worked in specialised units. They undergo training by experts. Their attrition rate is less than 2% and they are provided with all welfare measures, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-retd-colonel-on-ril-staff-was-first-to-spot-car-near-antilia/articleshow/86022349.cms||Rebecca Samervel

---||Ahmedabad||Take state off saline drip||Ahmedabad: Gujarat boasts of 1,600km coastline that has shaped its history and geography for centuries. But the same coastline is also the area of concern at several spots due to seawater ingress in groundwater, making it difficult for the local population to engage in farming or secure drinking water. A recent publication ‘Unveiling the extent of salinization to delineate the potential submarine groundwater discharge zones along the North-western coast of India,’ in Marine Pollution Bulletin journal by Elsevier highlighted the issue of seawater ingress in the coastal water aquifers in Gujarat. The study was carried out by Prof Manish Kumar from Dehradun-based UPES along with Chandrashekhar Bhagat and Pranabkumar Mohapatra from IIT Gandhinagar. The researchers said that they had collected samples from 56 locations ranging from Saurashtra to south Gujarat. Of the total, 42% of the samples were found to have seawater ingress in groundwater. Moreover, about 58% of the sites had submarine groundwater discharge (SDG), indicating that if adequate steps are taken, the issues such as high salinity and TDS could be addressed. The team has also identified nine probable sites where construction of checkdams can improve the groundwater quality. “The study indicated the possible remedial actions. We examined the earlier reports on salinity and found that the Gulf of Khambhat has one of the highest ingresses among areas under study,” said Prof Kumar. “The seawater makes way when there’s a difference between the height of the groundwater aquifer and seawater among, other factors.” State-based experts said that several local projects are focused on freshwater availability. One such attempt is from Rajesh Shah who runs Saline Area Vitalization Enterprise (SAVE) at Jambusar through his ‘green wall’ initiative. “We are covering the area of 18km with trees that survive in the region and are trying to reduce the effects of sea ingress,” he said. “But more initiatives are needed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/take-state-off-saline-drip/articleshow/86020121.cms||Parth Shastri

Mayor Kulbhushan Goyal said during the meeting of the Revenue and Realisation Committee, it was decided to take strict action against property tax defaulters to supplement MC revenue and carry out developmental works. From the list of 114 property tax defaulters, 10 with Rs 15 lakh pending tax have been issued sealing notices. The defaulting properties include Government Hotel Red Bishop, Gymkhana Club, two private schools, two filling stations, two private factories and two SCOs in Sector 11. MC officials have also issued sealing notices to two of the five mobile tower companies due to their pending tax amount. They have been given 48 hours notice to pay the tax. Out of total 292 mobile towers, only 37 have paid property tax, said the mayor. “Only Rs 3 crore has been deposited as tax so far by residents and property owners. As per the notice, they have been given 72 hours time to pay pending tax, failing which their properties will be sealed. The seal would be opened after payment of pending tax,” the mayor said. Saying that the exercise was essential to carry on development works in the city, the mayor warned tax defaulters of strict action. The civic body will now issue notices to residential property tax defaulters as well.

---||Delhi||Delhi’s second major smog tower in pollution hotspot Anand Vihar||NEW DELHI: After a smog tower became operational in Connaught Place on August 23, an over-20m-high tower — Delhi’s second major similar facility — was inaugurated on Tuesday in Anand Vihar, which is among the city’s most polluted locations. Funded by the Centre, this tower in east Delhi, too, has been developed on the same methodology as the CP tower, a Delhi government project. Union minister for environment, forest and climate change Bhupender Yadav virtually inaugurated it on the second International Day of Clean Air For Blue Skies. He hoped that the pilot project would yield fruitful results and supplement the air quality improvement efforts. The tower, proposed by IIT-Bombay, is downdraft type — polluted air comes in from the top of the tower and clean air comes out from the bottom — for localised reduction of PM2.5 and PM10. The filter system, novel geometry filtration system, has been designed by University of Minnesota, and is to work with an efficiency of 90%. Forty fan units have been installed to provide designed airflow rate of 1,000m3/sec. The tower has been built by Tata Projects Limited with NBCC (India) Ltd as the project management consultant. IIT-Bombay, in collaboration with IIT-Delhi, will validate its performance. According to officials, the performance is to be evaluated for two years. “An advisory committee, headed by the chairman of Central Pollution Control Board and comprising of experts from IITs, NEERI, MoEF&CC, Engineers India Limited, NTPC and NBCC, has been constituted to oversee the progress, review the performance and guide on improvement and optimisation. The committee has also decided upon its operational hours,” said a ministry statement. Outdoor air purifiers were earlier installed in Lajpat Nagar, Krishna Nagar and Gandhi Nagar. Tanushree Ganguly, programme lead of Council on Energy, Environment and Water, however, said “there is no scientific evidence yet that demonstrates that smog towers could be effective in cleaning the air. Data from all recently installed towers must be made open to independent evaluation” before setting up more such facilities. “The solution for air pollution lies in scaling up air pollution monitoring, building a better understanding of air pollution data and sources, improving the capacity of agencies responsible for managing air quality, educating common people, and strengthening our regulatory regime,” she emphasised.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/citys-2nd-major-smog-tower-in-e-delhi-pollution-hotspot/articleshow/86020251.cms||---
---||Rajkot||Gujarat: Four Great Indian Bustards sighted in Kutch||RAJKOT: While bird lovers were saddened that the exotic Great Indian Bustard (GIB) species vanished from Kutch, hopes were revived on Sunday when forest officials sighted four females in Kutch. However, amid the sliver lining, dark clouds of uncertainty still loom large on their fate as these were all female birds while no male bird was spotted along in the group. In July, union MOS for environment, Ashwini Kumar Choubey had stated in a reply to a question in parliament that the bird is no longer sighted in the sanctuary area. GIB sanctuary in Kutch is spread two square kilometre, but these four birds are found outside the sanctuary area. According to forest officials, the birds are moving in a 1,000 sq km area spread in Kutch, Rajasthan and some parts of Pakistan. GIBs are listed as critically endangered and it falls under schedule 1 of wildlife protection Act. Compounded by deaths taking place from adult birds crashing into the power lines in Kutch, the species is slowly getting erased from Gujarat’s map. Talking to TOI, chief conservator of forest Kutch, Anita Karan confirmed that four female birds of the species were sighted near Naliya grasslands. “We have always maintained that there are four GIBs in Kutch. However, the future of the species is grim as these are only female birds. Gujarat is a part of the breeding and conservation programme of this bird,” she said. Forest department sources claim that there are around 80 to 120 GIBs in Rajasthan, but they can’t take the risk to bring males in Kutch for breeding. There are several reasons for the fear, but the major reason is the threat to their life because of the high tension power lines. As the species is listed under critically endangered category, the state forest department does not want to take any risk. A conservation programme of GIB was started by the central government, in which artificial incubation is employed to create progeny from the eggs laid by these birds in the wild. As these birds would have human imprint, they can’t be released in the wild. They will be released into the wild with the other wild birds to increase their population only after the third or the fourth generation. Tushar Patel, assistant conservator of forest Kutch (west) said, “We have proper habitat for GIBs in Kutch, from where progeny in future will be released. They will be put with the wild birds so that they too learn the art of hunting. But till that time, our role is to prepare a good habitat for the GIBs.” According to the forest department, a lot of work has to be done on ground to prepare habitats in Kutch to relocate the GIBs here. GIBs feed on insects, fruits and crops, but with farmers in the region using inorganic techniques of farming with pesticides etc, they will have to be convinced to to change to organic farming for the betterment of the birds. Again, rampant encroachment of revenue Gauchar land in feeding as well as livestock grazing in the grasslands of the reserve forest have to be controlled, besides changing the overhead power lines to underground cables to avoid birds’ collision. Adult GIB male birds weigh anywhere between 11 and 15kg, while adult females weigh around 4 to 7kg. The birds live in the grassland and scrub and prefer to nest in the tall grasslands.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/four-great-indian-bustards-sighted-in-kutch/articleshow/86017736.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

---||Mumbai||Sachin Waze & gang planned to extort money from Mukesh Ambani: Chargesheet||MUMBAI: Dismissed police officer Sachin Waze, the mastermind behind the planting of explosives in a vehicle near Mukesh Ambani’s residence on February 25, had planned to extort money from the industrialist, according to the chargesheet submitted by the National Investigation Agency (NIA). “The intent was clearly to terrorise wealthy and prosperous individuals…extort money by putting…fear of dire consequences,” says the chargesheet that invokes the anti-terror law UAPA as well as stringent sections of the Indian Penal Code. The plot allegedly involved five serving and retired cops, including erstwhile encounter specialist Pradeep Sharma. They had roped in five others, some of whom had long criminal records, says the NIA. Waze left a note in the vehicle to threaten the Ambanis, says the chargesheet. To mislead investigators, a message was posted on the Telegram app purportedly showing a terror outfit Jaish-ul-Hind taking responsibility for planting the explosives, it adds. Waze also plotted the murder of the vehicle owner, Mansukh Hiran, NIA says. Hiran’s killers fled to Nepal while Waze tried to destroy evidenceThe gang of 10, with Sachin Waze as the mastermind, had not only conspired to target Mukesh Ambani by planting explosives in a SUV near Antilia, but also planted red herrings to mislead investigators. “The post on Telegram…appears to be a deliberate attempt to add credibility to the above said act of terror and the murder of Hiran was a direct outcome of the said act of terror,” the chargesheet says. NIA says demand for a payoff from the Ambanis in the threat posted on Telegram indicates Waze’s aim to reap monetary gains. Waze himself drove the explosive-laden car and parked it near Ambani’s home, it adds. The driver of the police vehicle that accompanied him was unaware of the conspiracy and was told it was a secret operation. Later, Waze got the investigations transferred to himself so he could vitiate the probe, and instill fear in the Ambani family and the general public, the chargesheet said. The next day when the police driver saw the news, he was shocked, but kept silent as Waze threatened him against disclosing anything. The chargesheet says Waze destroyed a visitor’s register at the police commissioner’s office to conceal his and his accomplices’ movements. Waze had booked a room for 100 nights in Hotel Oberoi in the fictitious name of Sushant Khamkar. He thought it was a safe place for planning and execution of the plot. On Waze’s instruction, Hiran had earlier filed a false case with Vikhroli police that on February 17, his Scorpio was stolen. Waze had kept the vehicle with him at his own housing society in Thane. Hiran, however, refused to play along after a point, which prompted Waze and his cronies to eliminate him. NIA said there were two meetings on March 2 and 3 in the police chief ’s office in which inspector Sunil Mane and former encounter specialist Pradeep Sharma were present. Waze ensured Hiran was seen here so as to have him identified. On March 3, Waze handed over a bag with cash and a SIM card to Sharma at his PS Foundation office in Andheri. Sharma, in turn, handed it over to Santosh Shellar to arrange a vehicle and recruit others. Shellar roped in Anand Jadhav, Satish Mothkuri and Manish Soni. In court proceedings, the prosecution had said Rs 45 lakh was paid to eliminate Hiran. On March 4 night, Mane called Hiran saying he was ‘Inspector Tawde’ and asked him to meet him on Ghodbunder Road. After picking up Hiran, he drove to a hotel and handed Hiran over to Shellar who was waiting in a Tavera car. Mane took away his mobile and told him he would be in safe hands. In the moving car, Mothkuri, seated in the last row, smothered Hiran and inserted handkerchiefs in his mouth while Jadhav and Shellar held his hands, said Soni who was driving the vehicle and has turned an approver in the case. At Kasheli bridge in Thane, they threw the body in the creek and then went to a dhaba for dinner. Before disposal of Hiran’s body, they removed his gold chain, a wallet with cash, debit/credit cards and wristwatch to prevent the body’s identification. After the murder, Shellar, Jadhav and Soni, on Sharma’s instruction, left for Nepal via Delhi, says NIA. Waze and API Kazi also allegedly dumped digital video recorders with CCTV footage of a housing society near Antilia, Waze’s own building and of Hiran’s shop in Thane along with phones used by the gang and fake car number plates in Mithi river. . Kazi’s advocate Zeeshan Khan said, “the chargesheet has been received by us…we have faith in the judiciary.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hirans-killers-fled-to-nepal-while-waze-tried-to-destroy-evidence/articleshow/86022423.cms||Rebecca Samervel

---||Ludhiana||Out on parole in 2012, man living with fake identity held||Ludhiana: The CIA-III of Ludhiana police commissionerate arrested a man with five passports made on forged papers and other fake documents. According to the police, the man was sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment in a case of drug peddling and when he came out of jail on parole in 2012, he got his forged documents made and started living with a different identity.The accused has been identified as Ranveer Singh of Jodhan, who had been living in Bhai Himmat Singh Nagar of Dugri for the past few years on fake identity of Sandeep Singh. The police have recovered four passports in the name of Sandeep Singh, one passport of his wife Sukhjeet Kaur in which she claimed to be the wife of Sandeep Singh, three Aadhaar cards, two PAN cards, a voter card, debit card, SBI passbook and marriage, birth and school certificates.Additional deputy commissioner of police (crime) Rupinder Kaur Bhatti said, “In 2004, Ranveer was held with 90kg poppy husk, in 2012 with 52kg poppy husk, and again in 2012 with a .32 bore pistol and ammunition. In the 90kg poppy husk case, he was sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment. The accused is married and has three children. In 2012 when he came out on parole, he decided not to return to the jail. Meanwhile, he met his friend Sandeep who offered help. Sandeep had his Class X certificate without a photograph and he gave it to Ranveer to get his other ID documents made. Using that certificate, Ranveer got all other IDs made with his photo and created a new identity as Sandeep Singh. He also managed to get his passport made. The passport is genuine, but the identity is fake.”ACP (crime) Pawanjit added, “Ranveer said he was planning to flee abroad with his family. The police are now searching for the real Sandeep Singh, who is living with the identity of another man. This is a big scam and the involvement of a public servant cannot be ruled out. There is also a possibility that the accused had helped others also in making forged passports.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/out-on-parole-in-2012-man-living-with-fake-identity-held/articleshow/86017783.cms||---

---||Pune||Pune: Poor response hits bid to link hospitals for real-time data sharing||PUNE: The district administration’s plan to connect public and private Covid hospitals for real-time data sharing and tracking has suffered a jolt because of poor response from the health hubs. After the Bombay HC’s intervention, the district administration had decided, by involving medical informatics experts from the Indian Medical Association, to connect public and private Covid hospitals via the internationally recognised software framework — Health Level (HL) 7. But its move to conduct a pilot project with a handful of hospitals could not materialise owing to hospitals’ reluctance to share data. Santosh Patil, the deputy commissioner at Pune divisional commissionarate, said, “The pilot involving a few public and private Covid hospitals to assess the utility of HL7 framework could not take off as the hospitals were not keen. We have not shelved the project. We shall do it.” HL7 is essentially a set of standards (messaging formats) for transfer of clinical and administrative data between software applications being used by healthcare providers. Hospitals do not need to change their software to use HL7. They just needed to add this feature, medical informatics experts said. “In a meeting at the divisional commissioner’s office in June, it was decided to connect a few government hospitals through HL7 to see how the system works. Thereafter, there has been no further discussion,” said medical informatics expert Rajeev Joshi, who is advising the district administration in bracing the dashboard through HL7. Currently, healthcare units’ software is not compatible with each other. This has led to islands of data that are not shareable. “Integration of hospitals’ electronic medical record systems with HL7 shouldn’t be an issue. We shall sensitise hospitals about not harbouring concerns about sharing the data,” said Sanjay Patil, chairman of the IMA’s Hospital Board of India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/poor-response-hits-bid-to-link-hospitals-for-real-time-data-sharing/articleshow/86022426.cms||Umesh Isalkar

---||Dehradun||Almora becomes first Uttarakhand district to commercially grow saffron||Almora: Encouraged by successful production of saffron in three blocks of Almora last year, the state agriculture department now plans to grow the spice in every block of the district and if possible, export it. With this, Almora would be the first district in Uttarakhand to do commercial cultivation of the world’s costliest spice. According to authorities, Almora was picked as its climate is ideal for saffron cultivation. “Last year, saffron was produced on a trial basis in Tarikhet, Hawalbagh and Lamgara blocks of Almora. A total of eight cultivators had been roped in. Now that the exercise has been a success, we plan to introduce saffron production in all 11 blocks of the district. We will start planting the bulbs on September 15,” TN Pandey, chief horticulture officer, Almora, told TOI. Last year, saffron bulbs had been procured in limited numbers from Kashmir’s Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences and Technology. This year, the agriculture department has ordered five quintals of saffron bulbs from Kashmir for mass production. The bulbs take three to four months to grow into purple flowers and then flaming red strands of saffron and picked from those. Once produced, the saffron would be exported to neighbouring states, starting with Delhi. If the harvest is big, it might even be exported to foreign countries, authorities said. Grown mostly in Kashmir, saffron was recently introduced to Himachal Pradesh. Sources told TOI that after Almora, trials to grow saffron would be conducted in Uttarkashi, which also has a climate favourable to nurture this crop.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/almora-becomes-first-uttarakhand-district-to-commercially-grow-saffron/articleshow/86017813.cms||---

But life in the shadow of the pandemic has made survival a daunting task for these artisans, busy giving finishing touches to the idols, as the festival beckons. For the second year in a row, it’s the same story of missing customers and little income at the two major areas for Ganesh idols in Dhoolpet and Auto Nagar area in LB Nagar. There are about 80-90 families of artisans from Rajasthan in Auto Nagar who work through the year to source raw material from their hometown to make Ganesh idols. This year, the orders are down to a trickle. “We have just two days left for the festival but there are no orders. Before the pandemic, orders hovered around 4,000-5,000 idols. Now, there are barely 100-150 orders across the 80-90 shops in the area,” says Mallaram Bawri who has been selling idols in city for the past over 15 years. Chennaram Bawri of Hayathnagar added: “We get raw material from Rajasthan on credit and pay after the festival. For two years we are not able to pay them. Earlier, we made a profit of Rs 2,000-3,000 on a 12-ft idol. But now I don’t think we will be able to even recover the investment.” It’s a tale of similar setbacks on the other end of the city in Dhoolpet. Prior to the pandemic, the area was a chaos of vehicles and customers jostling to buy their favourite idol. Now, it’s a life of uncertainty for artisans waiting for buyers. “We don’t even have the money to pay the interest on loans for raw material. If we are not able to sell these idols in the next two days, we won’t be able to survive,” said another artisan Rajan Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/artisans-face-hard-times-as-covid-hits-ganesh-idols-sale/articleshow/86022435.cms||Moulika.KV

---||Mumbai||Probe panel issues bailable warrant against former Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh||MUMBAI: The Justice Chandiwal commission set up by the state government to probe former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh’s allegations against former state home minister Anil Deshmukh issued on Tuesday a bailable warrant against Singh for securing his attendance before the panel on September 22. This is the first time in the Maharashtra police force’s recent history that a warrant has been issued in the name of a serving IPS officer for securing his presence. Ever since the probe began, Singh has been on medical leave. “Conduct of Parambir Singh warrants condemnation as invited by himself, (sic) has compelled the commission to issue a warrant against him in the sum of Rs 50,000. Considering the status and stature of Parambir Singh, the Director General of Police is requested to depute a high-ranking... police officer to execute the warrant. All safety measures for maintenance of law and order and medical examination as per rules shall equally be taken,” Justice K U Chanidwal observed in his three-page order. Justice Chandiwal said the commission has been given all powers under the Commission of Inquiry Act, but in spite of that, the matter has been dragged. The panel said “an afflicted class suffers brunt of orders” while a high- ranking police officer, supposedly well versed with law, avoided the commission “on pretexts referred in earlier orders... which apparently are untenable.” The concessions extended to him have been “misused,” it said, and added that on earlier occasions, the commission did not act, but a hint was given. “Today is the 15th date of hearing.. it is (sic) unexpected of such a high-ranking officer to abstain himself for 15 dates and to ensure calculatedly to get the inquiry protracted under the ruse of filing a writ petition or pendency of a PIL filed by an advocate, with which he has no concern,” Justice Chandiwal stated. Following a letter written by Singh to CM Uddhav Thackeary alleging Deshmukh had set a target of mobilizing Rs 100 crore from restaurant and bar owners, the state government on March 30 set up the one-man commission. Because of Singh’s failure to appear, the commission so far has imposed on him a cost of Rs 55,000. Accordingly, he has deposited the amount in the CM’s relief fund for Covid-19. Singh has not attended the proceedings saying he has challenged the validity of the commission. His lawyer had sought an adjournment, saying the high court may pass an order soon, but when no order was passed till Tuesday, Justice Chandiwal issued the bailable warrant. Singh’s plea for adjournment was opposed by Deshmukh’s lawyer Anita Castellino, who had, at the last hearing, urged the inquiry commission to issue a warrant against Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-probe-panel-issues-bailable-warrant-against-param-bir/articleshow/86022474.cms||---

Cops traced the rickshaw around four kilometres away from a rickshaw stand. The incident involved a family from Chhattisgarh who had come to the city on Tuesday to participate in post-death rituals of a relative. Sunil Agarwal, a resident of Ambikapur in Chhattisgarh, was staying in a hotel on VIP Road in Vesu along with three of his family members. On Tuesday all of them took an auto rickshaw from the hotel to reach Shyam Baba Temple. The family was also carrying a bag of jewellery as per traditional rituals which require family members of a woman to give her jewellery in case of her husband’s death. Since, they were four passengers in the rickshaw, the bag was kept in the narrow space behind the passenger seat. The family got down from the rickshaw and went to their destination but after a while realized that they forgot to take their bag. They returned to the spot to hunt for the rickshaw but couldn’t locate it despite searching for over an hour. “Police were alerted at around 1 pm. Examining CCTV footage and collecting other information we traced the rickshaw by 3 pm,” said R S Suvera, police inspector, SOG. The police identified the rickshaw and its registration number from From CCTV footage and also recovered its address. Since it was a rented accommodation, they found out that the rickshaw owner had changed residence. Cops then traced the rickshaw by inquiring at various garages to a garage from where they could recover the bag intact. “The family has come for post funeral rituals and by mistake lost the bag in the rickshaw. Police recovered the bag quickly and returned the valuables,” said city police commissioner Ajay Tomar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/cops-recover-bag-with-gold-from-rickshaw-in-two-hours/articleshow/86017807.cms||---
---||Jaipur||BJP vs BJP in Rajasthan: Kailash Meghwal takes on Gulab Chand Kataria, levels serious charges||JAIPUR: Former assembly speaker and senior BJP leader Kailash Meghwal has decided to move a censure motion against Leader of Opposition Gulab Chand Kataria over the latter’s controversial statements made on Maharana Pratap and Lord Ram in the recent past. The censure motion will be moved at the meeting of BJP MLAs scheduled to be held before the resumption of the sixth assembly session on Thursday. Meghwal shot a letter to BJP state president Satish Poonia on September 4 asking him to convene the proceedings of the meeting as the censure motion is against the Leader of Opposition. The matter didn’t stop with this. On the same day, Meghwal sent a detailed 11-page letter to BJP national president JP Nadda making startling allegations against Kataria right from 1976 to 2021. He held Kataria’s statement, disrespecting ‘Maharana Pratap’, was responsible for the defeat of BJP candidates in the assembly bypolls at Sahara in Bhilwara and Sujangarh in Churu, while reducing the victory margin of Deepti Maheshwari to 5,310 votes in Rajsamand. “Had he not disrespected Maharana Pratap, Deepti Maheshwari, daughter of former MLA Kiran Maheshwari, would have won by a bigger margin of 30,000-40,000 votes,” the letter says. The letter also includes a series of allegations against Kataria, based on his personal and professional experience. The main portion of the letter dwells upon Kataria’s alleged illtreatment of former Rajsamand MLA Kiran Maheshwari. “Kataria ji and his supporters had never missed an opportunity to disrespect her. From distributing anonymous letters with explicit and abusive content to creating obstacles in her political career,” said Meghwal. Recalling an incident that happened at a meeting in which he (Meghwal) was also present, he writes, “He (Kataria) called Maheshwari to a meeting and questioned her in indecent, shameful and abusive language. The language was so abusive that my conscience is not allowing me to write more about it.” “If you (JP Nadda) and party workers come to know the language he has used, you would never like to see his face,” the letter says. It also levelled serious corruption charges by alleging that lakhs and crores of rupees had been transacted under the shadow of Kataria on the basis of his position in the party and ticket distribution. “Former BJP state president Ashok Parnami was aware of his foul play and had returned the money taken for the purpose," says the letter. Kataria used his influence to keep former BJP leader and Janta Sena chief Randhir Singh Bhinder away from the party due to personal rivalry. He concludes the letter by blaming the opposition for not being able to raise public issues in an effective manner. “It has become a belief that this is the weakest opposition in the history of Rajasthan and Kataria is responsible for it,” says Meghwal in the letter. Poonia, who expressed ignorance of any such letter, told TOI, “I have not received any such letter. I will comment only after receiving the letter officially.” TOI repeatedly called Meghwal for his comment but got no response, while Kataria and Deepti Maheshwari were busy with meetings at Jaipur and Rajsamand, respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bjp-vs-bjp-meghwal-takes-onkataria-levels-serious-charges/articleshow/86022488.cms||---

Despite the presence of such a mechanism, the ED is conducting searches at establishments. This action by the ED is an attempt to override the state’s powers,” said Pawar after attending a function organised by a cooperative bank here. “We will try to raise the issue together when the Parliament starts functioning,” he said. “There are cases against Eknath Khadse, Anil Parab, Pratap Sarnaik and Anil Deshmukh. The ED is being used as tool. It is only in the last 2-3 years that people in country have come to know about the ED,” Pawar said. Pawar further said that the stand taken by the RBI against the cooperative societies and banks was incorrect. “The RBI’s policy hints at reducing the number of urban cooperative banks, closing them down and merging them. It will weaken the cooperative banking sector,” said the NCP president. He said that a decision on forming a separate municipal corporation in Pune should be taken after taking all the political parties into confidence. “Since the civic polls are nearing, it will not be good to form an additional municipal corporation,” Pawar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/ed-trying-to-override-state-powers-pawar/articleshow/86020264.cms||---

Around 150 offences were registered under this drive and Rs 47,000 collected as fine on a single day. The drive against the dark films was ordered by the police commissioner Ajay Tomar after it was found that the car involved in a road accident on Vesu Canal Road had dark glasses due to which police could not identify the driver despite having CCTV footage. “As per the Motor Vehicle Act and Supreme Court judgement, dark films are prohibited. Not only dark but any type of films, including transparent, are not allowed on car’s glasses,” said BN Dave, assistant commissioner of police, traffic. “In five days, police identified over 2,500 cars and they were penalized on the spot.

Punja Vansh, senior Congress MLA and chairman of the PAC (public accounts committee), in a letter to chief minister Vijay Rupani alleged, ‘The state education department has given 40 non-teaching assignments to government school teachers, which is causing a major negative impact on education. Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya, Sainik Schools, Sports Schools, Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas, Eklavya Model Schools accommodate many students.’ He added, ‘The government has given advertisements for contractual appointment of teachers at proposed schools of excellence. The government has claimed it will give admission to 1 lakh students in so-called ‘schools of excellence’. These PPP schools will not only cause a burden to the exchequer, but also compromise rights given under the Right to Education Act. ‘In the name of unavailability of students, the Gujarat government is trying to close down about 6,000 government-run schools. Education in rural areas will be hit by the move.’ Vinod Rao, secretary, education, said, “The allegation made by the MLA clearly shows that he has not read the policy. PPP model is not privatisation. This policy is to provide education matching the best private schools to government school students. They will be government school students. It is to leverage the potential of good students. Allegations of privatization are baseless.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govts-school-of-excellence-policy-a-scam-alleges-cong/articleshow/86020260.cms||---

The MoU was signed in the presence of chief minister Vijay Rupani. The pact was signed by Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) Commissioner Ranjithkumar and Abhijit Kamran, global selling head, Amazon. The Gujarat government said that Amazon will initiate capacity-building by conducting training, webinars and onboarding workshops for the MSME clusters in Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Surat, Bharuch, Rajkot and other cities.

The party’s CM candidate, Colonel Ajay Kothiyal (retired), said he landed a security guard’s job with the department after paying Rs 25,000 to an organisation without any verification of his credentials. The government has set up an inquiry into the allegations. Secretary of the women empowerment and child development department HC Semwal said the department is taking action. “We have set up an inquiry and sought a report from the authorities of the district to understand what happened and who is involved. The report will be filed in 10 days. Based on its findings, we will plan our next move.” “Some young people got in touch with me recently, saying they had paid money to an organisation to land a job in the department. To verify, I applied for the job. I was asked to deposit Rs 25,000. After I paid the money, I received the appointment letter. There was no screening or interview,” Colonel Kothiyal, 52, declared AAP’s CM candidate for the 2022 polls last month, told TOI. “It shows massive corruption in the hiring process.” Kothiyal, along with AAP workers, reached the secretariat on Tuesday with a box of sweets to meet the department officials. The appointment letter, by a Lucknow-based private agency, said Kothiyal had been “selected provisionally for the post of security guard, Champawat, on outsource basis for providing service at women welfare (sic) and child development department, Uttarakhand” for a salary of Rs 8,475. The letter was issued on August 6 last month but reached Kothiyal now. The letter, along with a hashtag on “job scam” was trending at number 3 on Twitter on Tuesday evening. The agency did not respond to TOI’s calls. “The money was taken as a ‘donation’ in the name of an NGO, Darpan, which is registered under the Registrar of Societies with one Ajay Pratap Singh as its president,” Kothiyal said.

The Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) has raised the issue with the concerned authorities and its office-bearers said multiple emails, reminders and request for meetings have not yielded any result. “Due to some technical snag in the Import Data Processing and Monitoring System (IDPMS), the bills of entry are not getting reflected on the website of Reserve Bank of India (RBI). As a result, the banks are not releasing payments against the imported goods,” said Dinesh Navadiya, regional chairman, GJEPC. “The issue is related specifically to the month of June. Nationalized banks are issuing payments but private lenders cannot make payment due to the rules. We have requested for immediate action with Directorate General of Systems, customs and excise department, RBI and Directorate General of Export Promotion,” Navadiya added.  “The time limit of 90 days for payment has also ended in September and they have to make the payment at any cost by the end of this month,” GJEPC regional office claimed in a press release.  “Local customs office has agreed to provide required documents in physical forms to banks if they are ready to make payment. But RBI did not give any positive response in this. In those ports, which do not have electronic data interchange (EDI) facility, the payments are made on physical copies of the bill of entry. Considering this as a special case, if RBI allows payment in non-EDI port method, the problem can be solved,” states the press release.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/tech-snag-costs-3k-units-rs-5cr-loss-daily/articleshow/86017882.cms||---

Kerala reported 25,772 fresh Covid infections and 189 deaths on Tuesday, compared to 851 cases and 15 deaths in Karnataka. The measure has been taken to curb spread of infections amid opening of schools and fears of an impending third wave, especially during the festival season. Issuing the advisory on Tuesday, the state health and family department has directed all educational institutions, companies, hotels, factories, industries and hospitals in the state to instruct students and employees who have not yet returned to Karnataka from Kerala to put off their return till October-end. ‘Kerala returnees testing positive’  Those who are in Karnataka should be advised not to travel to the neighbouring state till that time, it siad. “It is observed that despite bringing RT-PCR negative test reports, students and employees arriving in Karnataka from Kerala are testing positive for Covid-19 during the repeat test. The number of such cases is considerably high in Dakshina Kannada and Udupi,” said Jawaid Akhtar, additional chief secretary in the health and family welfare department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ktaka-advisory-defer-kerala-trips-till-oct-end/articleshow/86024066.cms||---

A Pune Regional Transport Office (RTO) source said the closure was a routine step taken each year during Ganeshotsav to restrict rush to the Konkan region via the highway. “Buses carrying people, be it private or those belonging to the Maharashtra State Road Transport Authority (MSRTC), can use the highway. Transport vehicles carrying essentials such as fuel, milk, LPG, liquid medical oxygen, foodgrain and vegetables can use the Mumbai-Goa highway,” the official said. Baba Shinde, president of the Maharashtra State Vahan Chalak Malak Pratinidhi Sanghatna, said, “Heavy transport vehicles from Mumbai on the way to Goa can first come to Pune and then proceed to Goa via Kolhapur. The vehicles can also take another route via Satara and Chiplun. Vehicles from Pune to Konkan will not be affected, as they take the route via Kolhapur or Chiplun.” A Pune MSRTC official said 165 additional buses were plying to Ratnagiri, Raigad and Sindhudurg in Konkan. “Over 500 additional buses are plying to Konkan from places such as Satara, Sangli, Aurangabad, Nashik and Solapur,” the offcial said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/heavy-vehicles-not-to-ply-on-mum-goa-route-till-sept-20/articleshow/86020287.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Jaipur||Jaipur: JDA in soup over ‘illegal’ luxury hotel construction at Rambagh Circle||JAIPUR: The Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) has allegedly let the construction of a 50-room hotel at the city’s Rambagh Circle for an influential hotelier without any approval and clearance of maps by the building planning committee (BPC). As per documents in possession of TOI, the influential hotelier is allegedly carrying out new construction and extending the hotel in violation of JDA norms. In an RTI reply, the JDA town planning wing has accepted that they have not approved any layout plan for the construction. “Despite several complaints, the JDA enforcement wing did not take action against the violator. In fact, the illegal construction is going on in full swing. The hotel is laying new concrete roofing, which cannot be termed as renovation. The other new constructions include swimming pool, bar, kitchen, etc.,” an activist alleged. Urban development and housing (UDH) minister Shanti Dhariwal told TOI, “I am aware of the matter. Directions have been given to the Jaipur Development Commissioner (JDC) to investigate.” On Tuesday, the JDA sought a factual report against the alleged illegal construction. JDC Gaurav Goyal said, “A committee has been constituted to examine the unauthorised construction, if any. The hotel administration has claimed that renovation work is being carried out. All aspects will be ascertained by the committee.” A senior official said that the owners can carry out renovation without JDA's permission as per norms. However, any kind of new construction, including erecting RCC columns, pillar and others, is a violation. “The committee will ascertain new and old constructions after a site visit. It will check Google Maps,” said the official. Apart from this, the committee will carry out a survey as the hotel administration has allegedly grabbed the Central Park land in violation of Rajasthan High Court orders. In April 2018, the high court had directed the JDA to remove all encroachments on the 322-bigha Central Park land and file a compliance report within eight weeks. However, encroachments done by the hotel have not been removed till date.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jda-in-soup-over-illegalluxury-hotel-construction/articleshow/86022526.cms||---

The complainant said that the verbal assault was launched by a man who was a common friend. The case was filed on Monday. The complainant, a resident of Vejalpur, said that she uploads videos of her acting and dance performances onto a social media platform. On the platform, she had befriended a resident of Patan named Bharat Patel about two years ago. She said she considered him to be her younger brother. The complainant said that she and Patel used to post encouragement and appreciation for each other’s videos. About a year ago, she befriended a woman called Lavina Singh on the social media platform. She said that later Patel also befriended Singh and the three of them engaged on the platform, giving kudos for one another’s videos. Meanwhile, the complainant and Singh began interacting on video calls. “During one such call about a month ago, Singh proposed that we have a relationship,” the complainant said in her FIR. “I rejected the offer of the lesbian relationship and blocked her number.” Singh then wrote a social media post accusing the complainant of betrayal for breaking off the friendship. Reacting to Singh’s post, Patel abused the complainant and her mother using casteist slurs. The woman eventually approached Vejalpur police. Cops have filed a complaint against Patel under the Information Technology Act and the Prevention of Atrocities (Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes) Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/59-year-old-rejects-lesbian-proposal-casteist-slurs-fly/articleshow/86020348.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Calls to ease curbs in festival season||BENGALURU: With the test positivity rate (TPR) sliding under 2% and the Covid-19 situation well under control, severe pressure is being mounted on the state government to lift night curfew in all 31 districts after Ganesh Chaturthi. Various stakeholders including representatives of trade and civil society groups have approached chief minister Basavarj Bommai, appealing to him to relax restrictions in cities like Bengaluru, where there are clear signs of economic recovery. “The situation is muchimproved in Bengaluru, so much so that people are not actually following night curfew norms,” said MS Shankar, general secretary, Forum for People’s Collective Efforts. “Shops are open till late in the night and traffic is as usual. There is no point in sticking to restrictions which are only on paper. Everything on the ground is normal.” He pointed to the “irony” of Metro rail ceasing services at 8pm when all other modes of transport are operating beyond that deadline. He said extending Metro services to 11pm will help boost the pace of economic recovery. Manoj Singh, cluster head, Nexus Malls that owns the chain of Forum Mall, said, “Businesses are missing out on crucial opportunities because of night curfew. About 60% of footfall at shopping malls comes from the dinnertime crowd. Recovery rate has not been as fast as it could be as food and beverage outlets are closed in malls.” While the government has lifted almost all other pandemic-induced restrictions, it has kept night curfew in place from 9pm-6am. A ban on pubs, swimming pools, sports activities with spectators and indoor practice also persists, while cinema halls can operate but with an occupancy limited to 50%. Caution the keyOfficials say the government is only being cautious as the Ganesh Chaturthi festival (on September 10) is around the corner. They say crowing and a lack of norms around the festival could lead to a surge in infections. They point to Kerala where infections soared after restrictions were eased for Muharram and Onam. While the government has allowed public celebrations of Ganesh Chaturthi for a maximum five days in districts where the positivity rate is below 2%, it is likely to consider more relaxations after the festival. “The present restrictions hold good till September 13. The chief minister will take a call on the status of restrictions and fresh guidelines will be issued accordingly,” said Tushar Girinath, principal secretary, revenue department. Calibrated approachCaptains of industry are advising the government to take steps to ensure a balance between economic revival and public safety. “It is time for the government to opt for a calibrated approach to relaxing curbs. While it is heartening to note the good pace of recovery, we must not lose the advantage of this momentum by lowering our guard,” said Kiran Majumdar Shaw, chairperson, Biocon. Soon after the festival, Bommai is expected to consult experts to assess the situation. The latest surge in Maharashtra and unrelenting virus spread in Kerala is still a cause of concern. And members of Covid-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) said they want to be cautious till October-November when the antibodies developed in people, who had contracted Covid at its peak in May, are expected to wane. “The October-November period is crucial for various reasons including anticipation of a third wave. Our advice to the government is to be cautious till that period is passed,” said Dr MK Sudarshan, TAC chairman.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/calls-to-ease-curbs-in-festival-season/articleshow/86024080.cms||B V Shiva Shankar

The organ donation benefitted three patients with end-stage kidney and liver diseases at Sahyadri hospital and Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital. “One of his kidneys and liver were allocated to two patients enrolled for an organ transplant at Sahyadri hospital and another kidney benefitted a patient registered with the Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital,” said Aarti Gokhale, the transplant coordinator of Zonal Transplant Coordination Committee — an apex body that oversees the allocation of donated organs as per the norms. The donor, a labour contractor by profession, had suffered subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), which is a type of stroke. He was undergoing treatment at Sahyadri hospital for the last few days. He was declared brain-dead on Monday. After being counselled, the man’s wife consented to donate all of his vital organs. “His heart and lungs were found to be unfit for transplant,” Gokhale said. The brain-dead man’s liver was successfully transplanted into a 45-year-old farmer from Malaegon in Nashik at Sahyadri hospital, Gokhale added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/brain-dead-mans-vital-organs-benefit-3/articleshow/86020322.cms||---

---||Delhi||Air panel asks Delhi’s neighbours to revise stubble burning action plans||NEW DELHI: Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh will have to come up with revised and detailed action plans to combat burning of harvest remnants in the next couple of weeks. The newly formed Commission for Air Quality Management in NCR rejected their draft plans and asked for changes. The plans, which were to be submitted by the end of last month, will now be submitted in the next two weeks after incorporating the changes the commission has suggested to each state. Sources said while each state had prepared its action plan to control stubble burning in its jurisdiction, key details and a common methodology to detect fire count were missing. While the air commission has asked each of the states to adopt a protocol developed by Indian Space Research Organisation to estimate the crop-residue burning counts, a number of details and ground-level inputs were found missing in the plans. Officials said the use of ISRO technology will apply to Delhi, Rajasthan, Haryana, Rajasthan and UP, with uniform data to be available to each state for submission to the commission for comparison with fire counts from the last few years. Sources said a multiplicity of ways to measure fire counts, including different satellite data, resulted in a fluctuation in the statistics required for comparison. A member of the commission, speaking to TOI on condition of anonymity, said while the initial plans had not been rejected, Punjab, Haryana and UP in particular had been asked to ‘update’ and ‘revise’ their action plans. “After last winter, each state was asked to prepare a stubble-burning action plan for the coming winter. Some flaws were found in the submitted plans. Each state was informed of what was required in addition to the plan specifications,” the member said. Burning of the remnants of the wheat harvest to clear the field for another sowing commences in October each year. The peak in these field fires are generally seen in November. The smoke released gets trapped in the air, owing to meteorological conditions such as low temperatures, a reduction in wind speed and a low-boundary layer. If wind direction is towards the capital, stubble burning results in up to as much as 40% of the total PM2.5 pollutants in Delhi in the months of October and November, according to past data collected by the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research, a forecasting agency under the Union earth sciences ministry. If the rabi crop harvest season in April and May of this year is anything to go by, Punjab and Haryana can be expected to be grappling with many farm fire events. The VIIRS satellite data analysed by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water between April 1 and May 16 found 4,000 more fire counts in Punjab this year when compared with the same period last year. The figure was also higher than in 2019. Similarly, fire counts in Haryana almost doubled from the record in the same period last year. According to satellite imagery, Punjab recorded 12,033 fire counts between April 1 and May 16 this year against 8,172 in the same period last year. In 2019, 10,307 fires were recorded during this period. Haryana showed an improvement from 2019, but compared to 2020, there were twice the number of farm fires this year. Data showed 4,825 fires in Haryana this year against 2,523 last year. In 2019, the figure was 5,443.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/air-panel-asks-delhis-neighbours-to-revise-stubble-burning-action-plans/articleshow/86020379.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand lost 1.2 lakh hectare agricultural land in 2 decades||Nainital: As the demand for land preservation act gains ground in Uttarakhand, with many prominent people and political parties supporting the issue, data provided by the state government suggests that the state has lost over 1.2 lakh hectares of agricultural land in the past two decades. According to the directorate of agriculture and state’s directorate of economics and statistics, the state had around 7.7 lakh hectares of net sown area in 2000-01, but it has now come down to 6.47 lakh hectares. The trend has only accelerated in the past few years, as the data suggests that 50,000 hectares of the total loss happened only in the last five years. According to officials, the situation is more worrying because over 70% of the state’s rural population is either directly or indirectly dependent on agriculture. Officials cite migration, disasters, as well as rapid urbanisation, especially in the plains, as major reasons for this trend. “Around two-thirds of the state’s rural population is dependent on agriculture. Because the land parcels are being used for other purposes and farmers are migrating, agriculture is in a state of decline, but the major reason for this has to be urbanisation,” said an official of the agriculture department. Though the plains of the state lost most of the land, even the hill districts -- which already have limited land for agriculture – lost around 30,000 hectares of net sown area. The official added that the animal menace and natural disasters over the years have also pushed people out of agriculture. “In districts like Rudraprayag and Bageshwar, more than 90% households have reported that their crops were damaged by animals, while in Chamoli and Uttarkashi more than half of the households say their crops were damaged by disasters,” the official said. In another worrying finding, the state’s human development report shows that agriculture and its allied sectors' share in the Gross State Value Added (GSVA) idex is also on a steady decline. Agriculture, fishery and forestry contributed 12.3% to the GSVA of Uttarakhand in 2011-12 but it came down to 8.6% in 2017-18. Agriculture and its allied sectors' share in Uttarakhand GSVA was almost half that of the national figure, which was over 15%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/uttarakhand-lost-1-2-lakh-hectare-agricultural-land-in-2-decades/articleshow/86017950.cms||Prashant Jha

Sport climbing was introduced in the Olympic games held in Tokyo this year. The newly-built arena will boost the country’s medal prospects in the upcoming international events, experts believe. Colonel Amit Bisht, principal of NIM and the chairman of Indian Mountaineering Foundation (north zone), said, “New opportunities have come up in sport climbing after the International Olympic Committee (IOC) declared it a medal sport in 2016. So, we constructed an indoor sport climbing arena in NIM, where we can prepare Uttarakhand state and national teams by nurturing talents.” Colonel Bisht said that it is the country's first indoor sport climbing arena of Olympic standard with world-class facilities. “It can be used for both training and competitions. It has two speed climbing walls equipped with auto-belay and timer, a 15-metre high and 12-metre wide lead climbing wall and bouldering wall with ten routes and crash pad.” The principal said that an Uttarakhand team is being prepared from a group of selected climbers. “The arena was recently used during a sport climbing training-cum-competition, organised by the IMF and sport climbing association of Uttarakhand. On the basis of this event, we have selected 25 climbers from different parts of Uttarakhand. We are aiming to make a state team for upcoming national games by providing advanced training to these youngsters. We are also planning to build a national team in a similar way,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/countrys-first-olympic-standard-indoor-sport-climbing-arena-opens-in-uttarkashi/articleshow/86017918.cms||Abhyudaya Kotnala
---||Ahmedabad||‘Clear stand on rail track, gas pipeline in Gir’||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Tuesday asked the state government to make its stand clear on formal permissions for laying down oil and gas pipeline through the Gir sanctuary eco-sensitive zone and gauge conversion as well as electrification of the railway tracks through the sanctuary. While hearing a suo motu PIL on protection of the Asiatic lions, the bench of Justice N V Anjaria and Justice A P Thaker orally observed that the state government’s stand is materially important on the issue of formal permission being granted to projects taking place in the sanctuary. The court, however, did not pass any direction because the advocates representing the Centre and the Western Railway were absent during the hearing. The court has posted further hearing on September 21, and it said that the government may be ready with the answer by then. The amicus curiae, advocate Hemang Shah, submitted that the government authorities have maintained a silence as to whose benefit the gauge conversion and electrification of railway tracks are taking place and who is going to benefit from the laying down of the oil and gas pipeline in the buffer zone of the sanctuary. He told the court that he has gathered information from different sources and visited the places in Gir and found out that the development projects in the restricted forest areas have been planned because of development of a port in Chhara and establishment of an LNG terminal. He submitted that HPCL Shapoorji Energy Ltd is the company that is setting up the LNG terminal. The amicus also submitted that laying down the pipeline may prove hazardous for the forest area. After advocate Shah mentioned the company’s name, the court questioned whether they are necessary parties to be heard during the hearing. To this, he replied that the government authorities are not disclosing the names of the groups, which are likely to be benefited from the project. The HC is hearing the issue suo motu since 2018, when the government informed the state assembly about death of the lions due to unnatural causes in and around the Gir sanctuary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/clear-stand-on-rail-track-gas-pipeline-in-gir/articleshow/86020377.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Court: All warrants against Maiank Mehta cancelled||Mumbai: British businessman Maiank Mehta, an accused turned approver in money laundering cases against his brother-in-law, fugitive diamantaire Nirav Modi, made his first appearance before a special PMLA court in Mumbai on Tuesday. Special Judge V C Barde allowed Mehta’s plea for cancellation of warrants against him. “All outstanding non-bailable warrants against the approver, Maiank Mehta, shall stand cancelled in view of his appearance in the court today...The approver shall furnish his own bond in the sum of Rs 50,000 and surety or sureties in the like sum,” the court said. Mehta and wife Purvi Mehta, Nirav Modi’s sister, will depose as prosecution witnesses against him. Purvi Mehta, a Belgian national, is yet to appear before the court. Warrants against her are kept in abeyance through an earlier order. During the hearing on Tuesday, Mehta’s lawyers Amit Desai and Manavendra Mishra sought cancellation of the warrants and also protection now that he was a prosecution witness. In January, the court permitted the couple to become approvers. The court granted the Mehtas pardon while allowing their separate applications to be declared approvers in the case. Desai assured the court Mehta would go to the ED office to record his statement whenever called. He submitted Mehta had moved abroad in the 1980s and despite living abroad for over 40 years, his “matru bhoomi” (motherland) was India. He said Mehta’s parents and relatives lived in the city. “He is a practising Jain and has come in the middle of Paryushan... He’s unfortunately caught up in this issue. It is a quirk of fate that his wife happens to be the sister of the main person,” Desai said. After the hearing, Mehta went to the office of the investigating agency. The court directed Mehta to furnish his address, mobile phone numbers, email id (supported by proof) and particulars of the person who should be contacted in his absence. “Approver shall appear as and when sought by ED before them, and before the court as and when directed, and shall be properly represented in the court by appearing in person or through advocate. He shall leave India only after intimating to prosecution-ED,” it said. Last week, Mehta intimated the court he would be arriving from Hong Kong and feared in view of the warrants, he may be detained. The court said, “The applicant Maiank Mehta shall appear before the court on September 7... no action shall be taken against him till he appears before the court.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/court-all-warrants-against-maiank-mehta-cancelled/articleshow/86022575.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Ahmedabad||Urdu-medium schools: HC notice over vacant posts||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Tuesday issued notice to the Ahmedabad Municipal Commissioner and the administrative officer of the Ahmedabad Municipal School Board over the demand to fill 45 vacant posts of science and maths teachers in the upper primary section in Urdu-medium schools in the city. The high court has sought explanation over non-appointment of teachers in Urdu-medium schools after the president of Student Welfare and Education Trust, Ahesan Shaikh, filed a PIL through advocate Aziz Alvi demanding that the vacant seats be filled at the earliest with qualified candidates. The petitioner has submitted that AMC and the school board has not been appointing qualified persons for the posts of science and maths teachers in the upper primary section in nearly 50-odd Urdu-medium schools spread over mostly eastern parts of the city. Shaikh explained that after the implementation of the Right to Education Act (RTE), the minimum qualification for the post of science and maths teacher is that the candidate should be a science graduate who has studied in Urdu-medium school up to at least the primary level. The PIL complained that AMC and the school board have not been recruiting any teacher for the subjects of science and maths for the upper primary sections in Urdu-medium school over the past five years. All the posts are vacant, but the authorities are not keen on filling up the posts. Shaikh claimed that during the last recruitment few months ago, AMC declared that it does not have any vacancy for science and maths teacher in its schools. Since there were vacancies in Surat municipal corporation-run schools, those selected candidates were sent to Surat by the state government. But when there is a demand to fill the vacancies, the authorities wrongly argue that qualified candidates are not available. But the reality is that students of class 6-8 in Urdu medium schools are taught science and maths by either language teachers or those who are qualified to teach social sciences. The court has posted further hearing on September 30.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/urdu-medium-schools-hc-notice-over-vacant-posts/articleshow/86020419.cms||---

The drugs seized include codeine syrup, commercial quantity of LSD, 105g of heroin, 400g (700 tablets) of nitrazepam, intermediate quantity of cocaine, small quantity of hydroponic and multi-strain weed. In the first case, upon receiving inputs that a Nigerian national named David is involved in supplying various drugs like LSD, cocaine, ecstasy, etc, in and around Parra and Arpora, NCB launched a special drive for identification and apprehension of the person over the past two days. Sameer Wankhede, zonal director, NCB, Mumbai, said that owing to the outcome of the efforts put in, the NCB, sub zone, Goa succeeded in apprehending the suspect on the Calangute-Mapusa Road, at Arpora, at 10pm on Monday. During the search, 11 blots of LSD (commercial quantity) and intermediate quantity of cocaine were recovered from him. Wankhede said the accused has been identified as David Chibuike Chisom alias Eze Chukwebuka Joshua, a resident of Nigeria. During investigation, David was arrested on Tuesday. In the second case, acting on specific information, a team of NCB-Mumbai officials launched an operation at Mumbai and seized 60g of multi-strain buds, also known as cannabis, concealed in a box of chocolates. The parcel had originated from Canada and was destined for Mumbai, officials said. The price of the multi-strain buds is around Rs 5,000 to Rs 8,000 per gram in the illicit market, officials said. Cannabis strains are either pure or hybrid varieties of the plant genus cannabis. Varieties are developed to intensify specific characteristics of the plant, or to differentiate the strain for the purposes of marketing, or to make it more effective as a drug.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Key revenue dept services to go online||Thiruvananthapuram: At least six crucial services of the revenue department, including issuing some documents that are mandatorily required for availing loans from banks and property registration, will be made available online, thus cutting down the possibilities of corruption and nepotism. The digital services offered include a mobile application for remitting land tax online, modules for providing location sketch, field measurement book sketch and thandaper account, module for submitting application for conversion of land, a land tax portal that will give full details of the previous history/arrears of the land owned by individuals, a module for application and shortlisting of social security pensions and individual websites for each of the 1,666 village offices in state with a provision to navigate and retrieve the details of even the last parcel of land in that village. “Citizens depend on the revenue department for multiple crucial services. The services being offered online will cut down the direct interface between citizens and government servants, alleviating the possibility of corruption, while offering services in a speedy manner. Digital services will also help in ensuring the services within a time-frame prescribed in the Right to Services Act,” said land revenue commissioner K Biju. Land tax payment has been a cumbersome task for the public, who would have to travel to village offices with the details of their land, multiple times on many occasions. Though online payment through the portal was enabled earlier, it had several glitches. The new ‘eRevenue’ app features the provision to assess the arrears of land tax to be paid, allowing land owners to use UPI payment mode to remit tax. The tax receipt will be received with a QR code, scanning which the veracity of the tax remittances can be ensured. The thandaper account and the location sketches are insisted upon by banks and financial institutions while seeking loans and registration of properties and the public usually visit village offices multiple times for them. The thandaper account would give the history of the land including the previous transactions. Also, in villages where the resurvey has been completed, the field measurement book sketch that has been digitized, will help citizens to know the exact boundaries of the land parcel owned by him as per village records. The application for conversion of land also can be hereafter be made online, which will ensure that applications cannot be prioritized on the basis of favouritism. The applicant can track the position of the application, its stage and also receive the final document after processing the application online. The revenue department will hereafter accept, process and dispose of the applications for social security pensions provided by the department– for cancer, leprosy and TB patients – online. The department’s online services, including the mobile app, will be launched on Thursday by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/key-revenue-dept-services-to-go-online/articleshow/86020390.cms||KP Saikiran

---||Ahmedabad||Specialty chemical makers’ capex to grow by 50%: Study||Ahmedabad: Specialty chemical manufacturers capital expenditure (capex) is estimated to increase 50% this fiscal. The capex surge will be driven by the revival in domestic demand and robust exports, states a study by Crisil Ratings. According to the study, the capital expenditure of specialty chemicals manufacturers in India will rise to Rs 6,000-6,200 crore in 2021-22, which will be 50% more than last fiscal. This fiscal’s capex will also be well above Rs 5,000 crore spent in 2019-20. The study involved 106 specialty chemical makers, which account for a fourth of the sector’s annual revenue of Rs 3 lakh crore. Gujarat is a leading manufacturer of chemicals in India. “The spurt in capex comes on top of substantial spend already incurred to add capacity in recent years, given the strong export demand for specialty chemicals, which has boosted revenue,” the study added. “Revenue growth is likely to improve sharply to 19-20% this fiscal, compared with 9-10%in the pandemic-marred last fiscal, driven by recovery in domestic demand, higher realisations owing to rising crude oil prices, and better exports,” said Gautam Shahi, director, CRISIL Ratings. “With western nations becoming more environment-focused, production is increasingly getting outsourced to India, which has also emerged as an efficient and cost-effective alternative to China. This has helped Indian players log a compound annual growth rate of 11% in revenue between fiscals 2015 and 2021, increasing India’s share of the global specialty chemicals market from 3% to 4%,” Shahi added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/specialty-chemical-makers-capex-to-grow-by-50-study/articleshow/86020450.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Readers’ corner||‘I got to know myself better’ By Bhavya Gupta I was into my fourth year of engineering when the pandemic began. While I was studying at the university, I had a notion that since people around me have the same course choice as I do, I could have the same goals as theirs too. This way the scope seemed very limited because I was more or less influenced by the 10-15 people I was surrounded by. I never got a chance to assess myself or to understand if I was genuinely into something or was it merely peer mentality at play. When the lockdown happened, I had a lot of time to myself which seemed quite overwhelming at first but it soon struck me that I was never self-aware and never gave my inner conscience any importance. This is when I learned to know myself better. I started by finding where my passion lies and moved on to making certain micro habits like learning a new skill/ reading/ self-affirmations an integral part of my daily routine, pushed myself into things I had once said were completely out of my comfort zone, stopped comparing myself to others because I knew each one of us has a unique journey of our own. I believe the year 2020 has got me closer to myself - learning, unlearning and loads of self-reflection has helped me realise how underrated self-awareness can be. (The writer is a computer science graduate) …............................ ‘Now I put mental health above all else’ By Anvita Bhogadi The lockdown taught me many vital life lessons. I saw my closest friends drift apart and experienced the loss of relatives. As I adjusted to the new normal, the cycle of distress seemed to continue. The fierce competition among peers didn’t stop for the pandemic. Everyone would jump at the chance to reveal what kind of courses they took during lockdown times and ridicule people who didn’t. I no longer looked forward to meeting my classmates as I felt excluded for not taking up courses. Add to this was the impact of social media. All this stress and depression lead me to prioritise my mental health and bring positivity into my life. I started taking yoga classes and began positive journaling, where I would reflect on what I was grateful for in my life and think of ways to spread happiness. And soon it all began to fall in place. I revived my interest for art and aesthetic photography. I began graphic designing and editing as well. I put together journal-scrapbooks filled with small things and moments from the present for my future self to cherish. In these times of a virtual lifestyle and constant demand of being near the screen, I fell back in touch with paper and ink; ending up being a night owl, comforted by coffee, books and Taylor Swift music at 3am. I tried my hand at different styles of writing and discovered the poet within me. I started posting my poetry on Instagram and sharing my feelings with the world. I also decided to work on my passion for activism- fighting for feminism, eradicating homophobia etc - and started volunteering for different student-led organisations. And after being through tough times and isolation for around 18 months, I learnt the most important lesson of all: even if dark clouds engulf you; you will always make it through. (The writer is a student of class 9) ......................................... Embraced changes to be healthy, happy By V S Venkataraman The most important lesson that Covid-19 has taught me is: Prevention is better than cure. I have now realised the weight of this saying and embraced certain changes to keep up with the new normal times. Earlier, my daily routine was walking casually while chatting with friends and visiting public parks. Now, I walk briskly inside with a face mask on and observe social distancing. Physical interactions with friends and relatives have been replaced with faceless contacts through social media and mobile phone. The present crisis is a challenge which I am trying to convert into an opportunity. Staying at home, I have plenty of spare time which I utilise to read books, practice yoga and do breathing exercises that enable me to gain peace of mind and keep my spirits high. With all this, I am feeling positive now and have adapted well to this post Covid-19 scenario for which I am immensely grateful to God. I must say that change is the only word that does not change in the ever changing universe. After all, we have one C between B and D, i.e., choice between Birth and Death. The choice is that we should not leave things to chance and adapt to change with a brave heart.

---||Hyderabad||‘Benefits being rolled out to encourage use of EVs’||Q. I registered my new car on July 29 and within 15 days I got my number. But I have still not received my registration card and I am told that the reason for this is a printing problem. Can we know when this will be rectified and if authorities are taking any steps to fix it soon? --- Chilakamarri Satyanarayana A. Yes, there is problem with printing of cards in some offices as the printers are old. We are in the process of replacing them with new printers and you will soon receive your RC card. In the meantime, however, if you wish you can register a grievance on our website: https://tsrtagrievance.cgg.gov.in/Login.do Q. There appears to be a spike in the number of road accidents in the city of late. Is the transport department taking any measures to check this and bring down the numbers? -- Kishore Nanda A. Yes, road accidents are on the rise in the city. The police department is conducting regular drunk and drive checks – as it is a primary reason for these accidents – while the and transport department is conducting several awareness programmes and suspending driving licenses of defaulters. Further, road safety Programmes are conducted every year for 15 days (as part of a central government initiative), wherein various road safety awareness programmes are conducted in coordination with other state departments such as the police, GMHC and Roads & Buildings departments. Q. What are the fines imposed on motorists for not following road rules? How strictly are they implemented in Hyderabad/Telangana? -- Deepthi Nath A. Fines are imposed as fixed under the compounding fee (C/F) schedule. There charges vary depending on the offence – driving with license, without fitness certificate etc – and the kind of vehicle. Apart from a fine, certain offences, like driving without a license, can also attract imprisonment. For details log on to: www.transport.telangana.gov.in Q. I had sold my two-wheeler to my apartment guard in 2019. While he has moved out of that job now, he has still not got the vehicle transferred on his name. Now, in case I buy a new vehicle will I need to pay the additional 2 % charges? -- Santosh Kumar Loya A. Yes, you will be charged 2% additional tax as long as the vehicle is in your name. That is because it is your responsibility to ensure that the purchaser transfers the vehicle on his/her name, once the deal is done. Q. What are the guidelines for use of vehicles that are more than 20 years old? -- Ashok Reddy A. The central government has introduced a new vehicle scrap policy which will come into effect in 2024. Until then, if a vehicle is fit to ply (road worthy), the same will be certified by a Motor Vehicle Inspector after which it will be reregistered for an additional five years. In addition, the vehicle owner will also need to pay green tax as applicable and will have to produce a valid pollution certificate and insurance certificate. Q. I am a senior citizen and during the lockdown I realised that my license (after 35 years) had expired in January 2020. Ditto with my wife. When we sought to renew them, we were told that since the licenses had expired more than one year ago, we have to apply for a new license, starting with learner's license. Is there no other solution? -- Vijay Asthana A. Yes, that is the only way. The government of India has amended the Central Motor Vehicle Act, wherein if a driving license is found to have expired for more than one year, one needs to go for learning license test (LLR test) and Fresh Driver’s license test, afresh. Q. If I have an abandoned, unattended vehicle parked within my gated community, and no resident is claiming responsibility for it despite many notices, what does one do to clear the vehicle? Asking because we were told to inform our PS and RTA before clearing them out. -- Prakash Savio A. If any vehicle is unattended; you can provide information about the unattended vehicle to the nearest police station for further necessary action. Q. Why are diesel autos/tempos/cargo vehicles emitting black smoke and blaring their horns not being banned from the city roads? They are not just polluting the air but also causing traffic jams. -- K Kasinath A. All commercial vehicles with life more than 15 years are not allowed on the roads within GHMC limits. Measures are being taken to take them off the roads. Further a lot of other steps are being taken to promote the use of electric vehicles to limit emission of greenhouse gases, by the Telangana government. Q. Is it safe to commute by public transport now? What kind of sanitisation is being done on a regular basis for these vehicles to be safe for travellers? -- Nishitha Krishnan A. All the public transport systems like RTC, Hyderabad Metro and the Railways are conducting operations in line with the prescribed Covid-19 guidelines issued by Central and State governments. In addition to that, we also urge all commuters to follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour for the safety of themselves and fellow commuters. Q. What steps are being taken to encourage the use of electric vehicles -- both cargo and passenger -- in the city? -- Anuradha M A. Telangana government is extending a lot of incentives and tax benefits for encouraging the use of electric vehicles, like zero registration fees and zero road tax, among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/benefits-being-rolled-out-to-encourage-use-of-evs/articleshow/86021867.cms||---

Party state president Bandi Sanjay Kumar said the public meeting will be held at Veyi Udala Marri. “We are demanding the state government to celebrate September 17 as Telangana Liberation Day. Amit Shah will address the public meeting to inspire the people of the state,” he said. It is said that Nizam’s Razakars (volunteers) allegedly killed over 1,000 people fighting against Nizam’s government near the banyan tree at Udala Marri, which later came to be known as ‘Veyi Udala Marri’. On September 17, 1948, the then Hyderabad state was merged with the Indian Union following India’s military action, popularly known as ‘police action.’ BJP sources said Shah’s visit will be significant ahead of Huzurabad’s by-election. BJP has been demanding the government to officially celebrate September 17 as Telangana Liberation Day. It alleged that the ruling TRS was scared of Asaduddin Owaisi’s AIMIM and hence was not ready to celebrate the day as liberation day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/shah-to-address-liberation-day-meet-on-sept-17/articleshow/86021498.cms||---

Soon after the report was published on September 4, the civic authorities swung into action and cleared the mess from the area. The person who reported the issue said that the possibility to highlight these issues through the newspaper is empowering citizens and is becoming an effective tool for Hyderabadis to solve civic issues. “I would like to thank TOI for choosing to publish the grievance and bringing it to the notice of the officials. The garbage is being dumped in the open because there are no vehicles for door to door collection of waste. We are relieved that the issue has been resolved for now, but I request the officials to ensure that the garbage is collected regularly,” said Mohammad Ahmed, the citizen reporter. Thanking the GHMC officials for acting on the report, a resident of the area Vicky Yadav said, “We are glad that the GHMC acted immediately and solved the issue. The garbage being dumped on the road was flowing onto the road due to the rain and it was obstructing the traffic flow. People were also worried about the health issues it might cause.” Sanitation supervisor of the area M Yadaiah said, “The issue has been rectified immediately after the issue was brought to our notice. It is also the responsibility of the residents to keep the premises clean and not dump the garbage in the open.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/shah-gunj-locals-breathe-easy-as-garbage-issue-gets-fixed/articleshow/86021820.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||BJP meet on Sunday to review Kerala poll rout||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Core committee meeting of BJP state unit would be held in Ernakulam on September 12 and is expected to discuss in detail the opinions, suggestions, and complaints that local leaders and party workers have shared with five committees set up to collect the ground-level reaction in the aftermath of the party’s rout in the recent assembly elections. The core committee meeting was originally scheduled in Thiruvananthapuram on September 11, but the date and venue were changed considering practical difficulties raised by some senior leaders in travelling to the state capital from northern districts, especially in the Covid times. A meeting of state office bearers was earlier decided to be organized in August to discuss in detail the fact-finding report on the huge setback the party faced in the last assembly election. However, the state leadership was forced to drop the plan following instructions from the central leadership that conventional meetings requiring physical presence of a considerable number of participants should not be organized until Kerala comes out of the current Covid-19 crisis. The fact-finding committees led by state-level senior leaders held discussions with leaders and cadres at the local level and prepared handwritten notes, which were submitted to BJP state president K Surendran. “Since it’s a fact-finding exercise, it doesn’t have any recommendatory nature. Their objective is to absorb the true reflections of the selfless workers at the ground level,” sources said. The decision to set up the five teams was taken following demands for a forum to give an audience to grassroot workers. It is learnt that all the five teams were in receipt of severe criticism for the manner in which the party handled the assembly election. The role played by RSS in the election has come under severe criticism, so was the shoddy management of resources and manpower by BJP. Several workers expressed severe disappointment over the internal bickerings among party leaders and the unsavoury and untimely statements by leaders like O Rajagopal and Sobha Surendran before and during the election campaign. There were widespread complaints of RSS leaders being control freaks and devising strategies that either failed to click with the public or backfired on party candidates. Many workers said that BJP failed to strengthen the organization at the grassroot level and the practice of RSS workers doubling up as part-time political faces of BJP should end. The central leadership’s decision to field Surendran from two seats too did not go down well with the cadres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/bjp-meet-on-sunday-to-review-poll-rout/articleshow/86020473.cms||B S Anilkumar

Any irregularity is overlooked.” Prabhakar stated that BJP would file a written complaint with the Union government against the CEO. “When by-elections are being held in other states, including West Bengal, why is it being postponed for Huzurabad?” he questioned. Prabhakar further alleged that four cabinet ministers —T Harish Rao, Errabelli Dayakar Rao, Koppula Eshwar, and Gangula Kamalakar —were politicising welfare scheme delivery. “These ministers are intervening in every programme and ensuring that TRS sympathisers benefit from them,” he said. On TRS candidate for Huzurabad, Gellu Srinivas, accompanying ministers during their visits to the constituency, he said, “This is highly objectionable. These ministers cannot do anything for the people of their assembly constituencies, but they are attempting to influence the welfare scheme implementation in Huzurabad.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bjp-demands-recall-of-ceo-alleges-bias/articleshow/86021619.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Dak bungalow where Vivekananda stayed in 1901 razed to build meditation centre||Pithoragarh: A historical dak bungalow in Champawat where Swami Vivekananda had stayed when he travelled through the Kumaon region 120 years ago has been demolished to make way for a meditation centre. The old building in Duery village was razed by the public works department (PWD) last month. Local residents expressed shock that the structure was demolished despite the state government’s assurances that a ‘Vivekananda circuit’ would be built along the route he had covered in his journey in 1901. M C Pande, executive engineer PWD (Champawat) told TOI that the day bungalow was demolished to build a meditation centre on the site. “The centre is being built under the Mukhyamantri Border Area Development Project (MBADP) at a cost of Rs 22 lakh,” he said. Mohan Singh Manral, author of books on the Indian monk, said Vivekananda visited Kumaon four times between 1890 and 1901. After staying at Mayavati ashram in Champawat district for 15 days, Vivekananda was to board a train from Pilibhit (UP) to Kolkata. “At that time, Pilibhit was the nearest railway station from Mayavati and it took five days to reach. So Vivekananda spent a night at the dark bungalow in Champawat. It’s unfortunate that such a historic building has been destroyed,” he said. Vivekananda was in Mayavati after he learned that his disciple Captain Sevier who had established the ashram had died. The ashram located in a tea estate has a museum that showcases some personal possessions of the monk. Prashant Joshi, professor of history at government degree college, Khatima, added that Swami Vivekananda had extensively travelled the Uttarakhand Himalayas in search of enlightenment. “The state should have done more to preserve his memories. There were talks of a circuit, but no concrete work has been done,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/dak-bungalow-where-vivekananda-stayed-in-1901-razed-to-build-meditation-centre/articleshow/86017998.cms||Prem Punetha

A complaint of cheating was registered at City police station against four directors of the firm that had launched several schemes in 2019. The police said that all the four accused were missing and have also switched off their phones. According to the police, Akshata Bhangaonkar, who was hired by the firm directors, filed a complaint against them as she too had invested money in their scheme. Akshata told the police that she had read an advertisement of CVK Parivar Nidhi Ltd in 2019 for a job placement. She met one of the accused Vijaysinh Solanki who introduced himself as director of the firm. He explained Akshata the investment schemes wherein the investor was given the interest of 6% on daily savings scheme and varying interest rates on fix deposits. Another accused Chhatrasinh Solanki told her that the firm’s main office was in Gandhinagar. Akshata joined the firm as central manager in its branch near Gandhi Nagargruh in August 2019. The accused hired several other staff who used to explain the schemes to investors and collected their identity cards as well as financial details. The accused even gave passbooks to the investors that showed updates of their investments. All the money was deposited in a bank in Raopura while the forms were sent to Gandhinagar. Akshata and the other employees even encouraged their relatives and friends to invest in their firm’s schemes between August 2019 to February 2020. About 150 persons invested Rs 33.55 lakh in various schemes. In February last year, the firm closed down its branch near Gandhi Nagargruh and didn’t pay salaries of February and March to its staff. When the investors didn’t get returns on their investments, they contacted Vijaysinh and Chhatrasinh who asked them to wait till May 2020. The duo then gave 52 cheques to the daily investors but most of them bounced. When the firm’s employees and investors tried to contact the directors, they were not available and their phones were switched off following the victims approached the City police on Monday. Apart from Vijaysinh and Chhatrasinh, two other directors Krupalsinh Solanki and Sanjay Joshi too have been booked for cheating.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/150-duped-with-high-returns-promise/articleshow/86018141.cms||---

Senior inspector Jagannath Kalaskar of the Bharati Vidyapeeth police told TOI, “Pitridevi Hariji Singh, the victim, was staying with her daughter-in-law in the flat, which is part of the 11-storey Lakewood society.” The officer added, “Her husband is undergoing treatment for some ailments in a hospital in Mumbai. Her son, who works with a private company, is staying with her husband in the Mumbai hospital.” The family is originally from Uttar Pradesh. Kalaskar said, “About four days ago, Singh came to Pune to stay with her daughter-in-law, who was staying alone in the city. The woman and her husband would frequently visit Pune, as their son and daughter-in-law were working professionals.” An elderly man from the society, who was out on a morning walk, saw the badly injured woman lying on the ground with blood flowing from her head and other body parts. He raised an alarm and local residents called police. Kalaskar said, “We are yet to record statement of the woman’s daughter-in-law. For now, we will register an accidental death case.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/woman-falls-to-death-from-8th-floor-balcony/articleshow/86020428.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Speaking at a public gathering in Sangareddy district as part of ‘Praja Sangrama Padayatra’, he said: “As the president of the BJP state unit, I am announcing that BJP will form the government in 2023 and we will bring the population control bill. I am challenging chief minister KCR to implement Muslim reservation, we will not keep quiet. We will implement the population control bill and ST reservation bills.” Objecting to TRS government’s attempt to introduce legislation to allow people with more than two children to contest in GHMC election, he stated, “Our party warned that we will not let that bill be introduced. KCR tried to bring that bill only to help AIMIM win in the old city as BJP was emerging strong there.” Calling the demand for Muslim quota as unconstitutional, he said, “BCs are losing out on many things. I am not against any religion, but we will not tolerate injustice meted out to BCs, SCs, STs and poor upper castes.” Defending his stand and claiming he was not being communal, Sanjay said: “Talking about our people’s interests is not against any other religion. I’ve never offended any other faith.” Earlier, south Bengaluru MP Tejasvi Surya termed Sanjay’s padayatra as a Dandayatra (invasion) against the TRS government. Surya claimed that before formation of Telangana, TRS promised ‘neellu’ (water), ‘niyamakalu’ (jobs), and ‘nidhulu’ (funds), but after taking power people have only got ‘kanneellu’ (tears), ‘nirudyogam’ (unemployment) and ‘atmahatyalu’ (suicides).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bjp-will-bring-population-control-law-in-t-bandi/articleshow/86021467.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

---||Delhi||Panel has pulled up neighbouring states for lack of groundwork: AAP||New Delhi: Commission for Air Quality Management has observed that the neighbouring states of Delhi have failed to take preventive steps to curb stubble burning, AAP chief spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj claimed on Tuesday. He said the commission had rejected the plans submitted by Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan for controlling stubble burning and noted its concerns about the lack of groundwork and hollow claims. The commission has warned that if the third wave of Covid-19 coincides with stubble burning pollution, it may prove fatal, claimed Bharadwaj. “Delhi government demonstrated last year how we can use bio-decomposers to decompose stubble and turn it into manure for our fields. Additionally, machines are available in the market to remove this stubble and process it,” he said. “The commission has observed the states have claimed they will use the stubble to make ethanol or for industrial and agricultural use. All this has been said without explaining how it will be implemented,” Bharadwaj alleged. “It has called out the discrepancies and dismissed the reports by all four states. They have been instructed to present a new plan to prevent stubble burning,” he added. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor called the press conference the beginning of an eyewash to ultimately evade the responsibility to stop stubble burning. Kapoor said farmers in the neighbouring states were forced to burn stubble as it was economically not feasible to remove it from land. Delhi government can extend its crores of rupees of surplus environment funds to the neighbouring states to help farmers, he suggested. Meanwhile, environment minister Gopal Rai said Delhi government had identified the biodecomposing method as an important measure to deal with stubble burning. A delegation will meet the Union environment minister and the commission to discuss the problem and present measures to combat it. Rai urged Delhi’s neighbours to implement solutions adopted by it to reduce vehicular and dust pollution. The environment department and Delhi Pollution Control Committee will start working on the Winter action plan from next week to combat pollution, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/panel-has-pulled-up-neighbouring-states-for-lack-of-groundwork-aap/articleshow/86020542.cms||---

The Union Cabinet is scheduled to discuss the relief measures to industry players, including Airtel and Reliance Jio. “If approved, the package may end up freeing up thousands of crores of rupees for the telecom players. The government is serious about its intent to keep the industry healthy and having a healthy competition so that advancements can be made towards new technologies such as 5G over the coming period,” sources told TOI. On the cards is a 2-percentage-point reduction in the licence fee that telecom compnies pay to the government, which is currently pegged at 8%. This will be in line with the recommendations made by regulator Trai. “The other big relief could be a re-calibration of the definition of AGR, which is used to compute the licence fee (LF) and spectrum usage charge (SUC). The government may allow companies to exclude their non-telecom earnings from AGR calculations, which will effectively help them reduce the LF and SUC payouts to the exchequer,” a source said. The government may also give the industry an extended holiday on spectrum payments beyond the two-year moratorium that players are already enjoying. While the financial woes at Vodafone Idea seem to be the immediate trigger behind the telecom department’s urgency to approve a bailout, analysts say that “market leader Reliance Jio and secondbiggest Bharti Airtel would be the big gainers” from any government support. “While a weak player like Vodafone Idea gets breathing space to put its house in order and work out a revival strategy by roping in investors, the stronger players will get a huge boost by cut in taxes and other relief measures. Their operations get even stronger and financially more stable, and robust,” an analyst, who advises some of the telecom companies, said. A top source said telecom secretary Anshu Prakash and senior officials from the telecom department had made presentations at the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), ahead of preparing the proposals for the Cabinet. “The telecom ministry has been working overtime to prepare a package. Many officers have been working late nights as the government undertakes urgent steps to help the industry come out of the financial mess,” the source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/cabinet-to-discuss-bailout-package-for-telecom-today/articleshow/86025105.cms||Pankaj Doval

---||Kochi||Case filed against IAS officer for abusive message to scribe||Kochi: Kochi police registered a case against IAS officer N Prasanth on charges of insulting the modesty of a woman after he had allegedly sent abusive messages to a woman journalist via WhatsApp. The case was registered at Palarivattom police station on Tuesday under Section 509 (…to insult the modesty of any woman, utters any words, makes any sound or gesture…) based on a complaint submitted by Kerala Union of Working Journalists (KUWJ) to the chief minister. The incident pertaining to the case happened in February amid the EMCC deep sea fishing controversy. Kerala State Inland Navigation Corporation (KSINC) had signed an MoU with US-based EMCC International Pvt Ltd for construction of deep-sea fishing trawlers. The government (including then fisheries minister J Mercykutty) had said that Prashanth – the managing director of KSINC –was responsible for providing the details related to the deal to the then opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala. Following this, Prashanth was approached by a woman journalist of a leading vernacular daily in Kochi via WhatsApp to get his official response in connection with controversy. However, the 2007 batch officer reportedly responded with ‘abusive replies and emojis’. The officer’s response attracted much criticism. Later, Prashanth also came up justifying his actions through social media posts. Based on the complaint from KUWJ, the state government later had ordered a probe against him for his alleged misbehaviour. Later, the police held a preliminary enquiry and collected statements from the woman. After the preliminary enquiry, the police sought legal advice from the directorate of prosecution to register a case against him. Sources said that the directorate of prosecution observed that government officials can deny or provide information when journalists approach them for official reactions for news purposes but they are not supposed to misbehave. Later, consent was given to register a case against the IAS officer. “We have registered the case and further action will be initiated,” said a police officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/case-filed-against-ias-officer-for-abusive-message-to-scribe/articleshow/86020605.cms||---

Justice B Pugalendhi observed that the reputation of the institution has to be preserved by conducting proper investigation in such matters. Meanwhile, the investigating officer had submitted a detailed report on the investigation conducted so far in this case. The judge said this court has confidence on the investigating agency that an appropriate investigation would be conducted in this case. The court made these observations while hearing the anticipatory bail plea of suspended inspector Vasanthi. The case was listed under the caption ‘for withdrawal’ on Tuesday. Taking into account that the petitioner was arrested during the pendency of her anticipatory bail plea and that the petitioner’s counsel had filed a memo seeking to withdraw the petition, the judge permitted the withdrawal of this petition.

It will help save vulnerable groups from severe health impacts of air pollution. An online campaign to demand public health advisories has also been started. Brikesh Singh, convener of Clean Air Collective — a national collaborative network of organisations, individuals and institutions working towards the common objective of clean air, said this citizen-led campaign was being carried out across 132 non-attainment/million-plus cities via the online petition. Non-attainment cities are those that do not meet the air quality standards set by the Union environment ministry. There is a mandate under National Clean Air Action Plan to issue public health advisories on days when air quality is unhealthy for citizens, said Singh. Dipankar Saha, former additional director of Central Pollution Control Board, said health warnings were essential if the air quality index for a certain region crossed the safe limit. “It should be done locally as far as possible to reach out to maximum people. We must take all on board.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/online-campaign-begins-for-issuing-health-advisory-on-bad-air-days/articleshow/86020597.cms||---

As per the status report submitted by the commissioner of survey and settlement, the number of applications pending for disposal as on October 1 2020, was 5,76,771. Of these, 4,77,474 applications have already been disposed of and 99,297 are pending. Similarly, from October 10, 2020 to March 31, 2021, a total of 8,81,269 applications have been received, of which 8,62,787 (98%) have been disposed of in spite of the election duty assigned to the survey staff in taluk offices. As of April 1, 2021, a total of 5.95 lakh applications are pending. With the current manpower, the maximum of 1.5 lakh applications could be disposed per month. However, around 1.5 lakh new applications are received every month. In order to clear the backlog (5.95 lakh pending applications) in six months time, around 2.5 lakh applications have to be disposed of every month. Following the implementation of automatic mutation of not involving sub-division (NISD) applications, the work burden on the VAOs has been considerably reduced. If they are engaged in the disposal of involving sub-division (ISD) applications as per a GO, their disposal can be increased to 2.5 lakh per month. By this process, the 5.95 lakh pending applications can be disposed of in six months. However, for implementing the same, the interim stay granted by the principal seat has to be vacated. A vacate stay petition has already been filed in this regard, said the report. Taking cognizance, justice Krishnakumar observed that insofar as the other directions are concerned, the commissioner of land administration department has not filed a status report. Since the state sought time to file status report by furnishing all the details of the pending and disposal of the applications upto July 2021. In October 2020, justice D Krishnakumar who took serious note of the pendency of lakhs of patta transfer applications for several years, had issued a slew of directions to the state government to dispose of such applications before March 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/1-5l-patta-applications-disposed-of-every-month-state-tells-hc/articleshow/86020594.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||Mumbai||BMC makes eligibility criteria must for freebies distribution||MUMBAI: In a major check on the misuse of civic funds during the distribution of freebies by corporators, the BMC has issued a circular making it mandatory to fix the eligibility criteria for various items and invite applications to select the beneficiaries. The BMC has been distributing freebies like laptops and tablets, jute bags, food trucks, sewing machines, tarpaulin sheets and dustbins without any clear guidelines and eligibility criteria for beneficiaries. The Opposition had alleged that this was leading to misuse of funds as most freebies were being given to party workers instead of those who really needed them. TimesViewThe BMC’s circular to fix eligibility criteria for freebies and make distribution transparent is welcome. At a time when the BMC is facing a cash crunch, it is surprising that corporators are on a spending spree, using civic funds for distributing freebies ranging from computers and jute bags to food trucks. The BMC must first focus on providing basic civic amenities like good roads and open spaces to citizens.Political observers said that with the BMC elections scheduled next year, freebies are in high demand. The new circular issued by the BMC’s planning department has made it mandatory to fix the eligibility criteria for items and seek applications from citizens. “The officials concerned must issue an advertisement in newspapers about items being distributed and applications must be invited in a transparent manner,” said Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner (Planning). “All applications must be screened and only those eligible must be given the items. This way there will be a record of all applications, there will be no duplication of beneficiaries.” A major controversy had broken out in February when BJP corporator Vinod Mishra filed a complaint with the Comptroller and Auditor General against the BMC’s bid to buy freebies, including 30 food and vegetable trucks in Shiv Sena corporator Yashwant Ja-dhav’s constituency in Byculla. Mishra had demanded an audit of the purchases alleging that they were done in violation of the central vigilance commission norms. Proposals were also passed to buy gym equipment worth Rs 2 crore, CCTV cameras in constituency no 209 worth Rs 1 crore, solar street lights for Rs 50 lakh and high mast lights for Rs 1 crore and steel benches worth Rs 90 lakh. “We come this circular. Most freebies are given to close associates of the ruling Shiv Sena,” said Mishra. “We are not against freebies, but there must be a fixed eligibility criteria. BMC funds must be used for making durable assets and not for distribution of freebies. There must be an audit of all the freebies distributed so far.” In March, in a major policy change, the BMC had moved Rs 650 crore of the corporators’ fu-nds from its revenue budget to capital budget. This means distribution of freebies and recurring works being carried out by corporators from these funds has become more difficult.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-makes-eligibility-criteria-must-for-freebies-distribution/articleshow/86022747.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

The roads have been proposed in forest division purviews of Ichoda, Utnoor, Kinnerasani Wild Life Management, Asifabad, Kagaznagar, Gudur, and Khanapur. According to the forest officials, mitigation measures would be taken up by constructing underpasses and passages for movement of wildlife wherever roads are being constructed in the core forest areas. Environment and forests minister A Indrakaran Reddy asked the forest department officials to ensure speedy permissions for the road projects. The Telangana government has recently drawn flak for allegedly violating forest conservation laws by taking up road construction works in at least three reserve forest areas. The issue came up for discussion at the 49th meeting of the Regional Empowered Committee (REC) under the Union ministry of environment, forest & climate change (MoEF&CC). According to the meeting’s minutes, of the 24 proposed road development projects, nine were completed in reserve forests without obtaining permissions.

Congress corporator Nitin Sathaone, BJP corporators Dr Jyoti Bhisikar, Abhiruchi Rajgire and Mahesh Mahajan claimed that water supply in Shanti Nagar command area is satisfactory. “The civic body has already completed the work of 24x7 water project. So the NMC should start supplying potable water round-the-clock,” said Sathaone. In separate letters addressed to executive engineer (water works department), all the four corporators admitted that till September 5 there were issues related to low pressure and inadequate water supply in several areas of Prabhag number 21. However, now the problem has been resolved, they stated. On Monday, Pande had staged a protest over inadequate and contaminated water supply in many areas under Shanti Nagar command area. Following the protest, NMC and Orange City Water had resolved the issues raised by Pande. The independent corporator expressed surprise over the swift reaction from the four sitting corporators. “They were sleeping so far and when the problem raised by me was resolved, these corporators are shouting to claim credit,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/day-after-pande-flags-water-woes-corporators-say-alls-well/articleshow/86020649.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

The book, Pandit Bhimsen Joshi- Celebrating His Legacy, has been authored by classical music exponent and academic Kasturi Paigude Rane. It was launched in New Delhi by classical music exponent Wasifuddin Dagar and Kiran Seth, the founder of SPIC MACAY, which helps in popularising Indian classical art forms to students. Rane, who is based in Pune and teaches music at the Lalit Kala Kendra, Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU), joined via a remote link. Over the next few months, the publishers will also launch translations of the book in Marathi, Bengali and Kannada. Joshi had a significant association with SPIC MACAY and performed at many events in schools and colleges. Incidentally, Rane’s first meeting with Joshi took place at a SPIC MACAY event at Pune’s Fergusson College. “The first time I met Panditji was at a SPIC MACAY event at Fergusson College in 2000 when I was a student there. I was blown away by his personality and his performance. I did not think then that one day I will be told to write a book on him. ,” Rane recalled. The book is a based on a set of interviews that Rane conducted with members of Joshi’s family, as well as those associated with the Arya Sangeet Prasarak Mandal, the organisation that Joshi founded for popularisation of Indian classical art forms and which organises the annual Sawai Gandharva Bhimsen Mahotsav. The book includes anecdotes of Rane’s meetings with Joshi, memories of his students, as well as those who do not harbour much interest in Indian classical music but had heard his music and saw him on mass media.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/ib-ministry-releases-book-on-bhimsen-joshi-on-his-centenary-year/articleshow/86020630.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

The idea has been embraced by grown-ups and children alike. “As the name suggests, the seeds of vegetables and flowering plants are sown in the Ankur Ganesh idol. The plant begins to grow after the seeds receive moisture during the ritual of idol immersion,” said Amol Kulkarni, a representative of Manovedh Foundation, which is promoting the concept. According to the foundation, the unique concept not only promotes eco-friendly celebration but helps in soil conservation at the same time. The Ganapati idols are made using local red or black fertile soil and not shadoo clay since it does not promote growth of plants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/ankur-ganesh-brings-green-tinge-to-festival/articleshow/86016281.cms||Abhilash Botekar

The district has so far reported 462 dengue cases in 2021, accounting for nearly 30% of all cases to have surfaced in the state. Similarly, 708 malaria cases emerged in the district of the nearly 1,100 cases in the state, contributing about 60% of the total malaria caseload of the state. The district also witnessed 24 chikungunya cases. Overall, the district accounts for nearly 40% of total seasonal diseases in the state As has become the trend, Vizag city contributes a major chunk of the dengue case total of the district every year. For example, of the 462 dengue cases in the district, more than 250 are from Vizag city. According to district officials, there has been a spurt in seasonal disease case numbers this year in Ananthagiri, Araku, Paderu, Chintapalli, Hukumpeta and Dumbriguda mandals in the tribal belt and Rolugunta, Kasimkota, Devarapalli and Butchayyapeta mandals in the rural parts of the district, apart from Vizag city. With the increasing case numbers, there has been an influx of patients into various government and private hospitals in the district in recent weeks. Sporadic rains associated with mosquito breeding are said to be the major cause of increasing cases. June to is the peak season for vector-borne diseases in the state. Officials of the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) informed that they have started releasing Gambusia fish, which are predators of mosquito larvae, into the wells of the city. The fish, which measure between one to two inches, is capable of ingesting mosquito larvae about twice its weight in a day. Disease-carrying mosquitoes mostly flourish in stagnant water and these fish help prevent stagnant waters from becoming breeding grounds. According to experts, urbanisation has been providing thriving larval habitats for mosquito vectors—right from artificial containers, tyres and changing lifestyle—to crowded human population and unplanned urbanisation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/vizag-continues-to-be-states-seasonal-diseases-capital/articleshow/86018216.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation to pay Rs 1.5 lakh to family for child’s death in open manhole||AHMEDABAD: A city civil court ordered the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) to pay Rs 1.50 lakh compensation for its negligence, which resulted in the death of a seven-year-old boy, who died after falling into a manhole because AMC employees did not shut its lid. The order for compensation comes some 14 years after the incident. The episode took place near Shahpur Darwaza on January 19, 2004, when little Jayesh Dantaniya went out to play in the morning. He was not found till the afternoon sending his family into alarm.  A fire brigade team was informed and asked to trace the child. This was because the fire station was just beside the family’s house. The next day, firemen retrieved the child’s body from a sewer. The postmortem report suggested that he had died of asphyxiation. One year later, Jayesh’s family filed a suit seeking Rs 1.5 lakh from the civic body for their negligence. They asserted that the manhole had been kept open for nearly a month. When the court asked the civic authorities, an engineer told the court that the road on which the accident took place sees heavy traffic and there was no possibility of the lid being left open. After hearing the case, the court concluded that there was ample evidence to suggest that the manhole was open. It is the duty of AMC employees to maintain the gutter line and keep the lid shut. “Hence, it is proved that the employees of the defendant corporation failed to take proper care and they did not shut the lid of the gutter,” the court said and added that the victim was just a child and cannot be held to be negligent. The court held the AMC vicariously liable to pay compensation for the negligence of its employees and ordered it to pay Rs 1.50 lakh with 8% interest, saying that the family is entitled to compensation under various heads like future loss of income, loss of love and affection, funeral expenses etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/amc-to-pay-rs-1-5l-to-family-for-childs-death-in-open-manhole/articleshow/86020702.cms||---

The driver of the truck, carrying water pipes to Rishikesh, had taken the wrong carriageway to avoid a U-turn that was 500 m away.The five persons who died were identified as Ashish Sinha (33), his wife Shilpi (30), their son Dev (1), Ashish’s brother-in-law Sonu (35) and Sonu’s daughter Kavya (11). Sonu’s wife Nidhi (28) and Ashish’s daughter Shivi (4) are battling critical injuries in the ICU of a private hospital. The bodies have been sent for autopsies and the reports are awaited.According to family members, Ashish and his family had come to Indirapuram from Lucknow on Sunday morning. Both the families had planned to go to Rishikesh for Dev’s mundan ceremony. “Since the mundan was scheduled for early morning, the families left for Rishikesh on Sunday night itself. They spent the day in Rishikesh and were returning home when the accident took place on Monday night,” said Manoj Kumar, Sonu’s elder brother.The car — a Maruti Alto — belonged to Sonu, a power department employee, and he was driving it. “It was around 11.30pm when we got a call from police. We rushed to the hospital in Kavi Nagar, but Sonu and the others had died by then. We were told that Nidhi and Shivi were undergoing treatment in the ICU and were critical,” Kumar said.Shailendra Pratap Singh, the SHO of Masuri police station, said they got information about the accident around 10.10pm and a team was sent to the spot. The occupants were pulled out of the mangled car and rushed to a private hospital. The five were declared dead on arrival while the two others were rushed to the ICU.“The truck driver has been identified as Bablu (30), a resident of Amroha. He tried to flee but was caught by a police team in Bhojpur. He told his interrogators that he took the wrong carriageway to cut down on travel time. There was a U-turn 500 metres away which he wanted to avoid,” Singh said.Following a complaint by Sonu’s family, an FIR has been registered against the truck driver under sections 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 279 (rash driving) and 338 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) of the IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/truck-on-wrong-side-hits-car-on-dme-5-die/articleshow/86023472.cms||---

The directive came on an application filed by the investigating officer in the case, who alleged that former Noida police chief Sharma and the three others — Chandan Rai, Swapnil Rai and Atul Kumar — hadn’t got their voice samples tested at the forensic science laboratory in Lucknow despite a notice to them..In September 2020, the vigilance department had lodged an FIR in Meerut against Sharma and another IPS officer, Himanshu Kumar, under Section 8 of the Prevention of Corruption Act for allegedly lobbying for suitable posts. The three others were accused of acting as middlemen.As part of investigation, the vigilance team had attached recordings of phone calls and chat clippings from the cellphones of the trio, who were in touch with the police officer. “The investigating officer had filed an application in the court. However, Sharma and the three others had submitted their objections to the application, saying that a media trial was being conducted against them,” said Sanjeev Gupta, additional government counsel. The court of special judge (anti-corruption) Gyan Prakash Singh, however, directed Sharma and the others to get their voice samples recorded.In January 2020, Sharma was transferred from Rampur, where he was the SP, to the police training centre in Unnao after a report by former Noida SSP Vaibhav Krishna named him and five other IPS officers in a cash-for-postings racket.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/postings-row-ips-officer-asked-to-get-voice-sample-tested/articleshow/86023482.cms||Shikha Salaria

While slamming Maharashtra BJP unit for celebrating the victory, the Sena spokesperson had termed Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti’s (MES) defeat in the Belgaum elections as “unfortunate”, stating it was a betrayal and defeat of Marathi speaking people. A regional outfit, MES is fighting for the merger of Marathi-speaking areas of Belgaum into Maharashtra. “Out of our 35 elected members, 15 are Marathi speaking. Therefore, Marathi Manoos cannot be defeated ever. They should not be equated with any party,” the former CM said during his interaction with the media in the city. The border district of Belgaum is the bone of contention between Maharashtra and Karnataka since decades, as former staked its claim on the territory on linguistic grounds claiming it to be a part of erstwhile Bombay Presidency. On his appointment as Goa in-charge for the elections, Fadnavis expressed confidence that BJP would bounce back in the state based on good work by chief minister Pramod Sawant and former defence minister Manohar Parrikar. “I am grateful to BJP president JP Nadda for bestowing me the opportunity. Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, we would retain power in Goa. We will work under the guidance of home minister Amit Shah, defence minister Rajnath Singh and transport minister Nitin Gadkari, and follow the path shown by late Parrikar.” Speaking on Uttar Pradesh polls, the senior BJP leader said the saffron party would win polls with a landslide under the leadership of PM Modi and CM Yogi Adityanath. “Yogi’s leadership is impressive and inclusive where he has taken care of all castes and communities along with development,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bjps-belgaum-victory-defeat-of-sanjay-rauts-arrogance-not-of-marathi-manus-fadnavis/articleshow/86047745.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Hyderabad||IIIT-Hyderabad team devises new way to perform quantum chemistry calculations||HYDERABAD: Researchers at the International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad (IIIT-H) designed a novel way of performing quantum chemistry calculations. The new method helps to predict the molecular properties and model chemical reactions. Utkarsh Azad, dual degree research student at IIIT H, under the guidance of Harjinder Singh attempted to showcase the abilities of NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-scale Quantum) device - the current generation of quantum computers that use the properties of quantum physics to perform calculations, outperforming traditional machines such as laptops and others - for doing quantum chemistry calculations. A student of the Center for Computational Natural Sciences and Bioinformatics (CCNSB), IIITH, Utkarsh said that modelling chemical reactions on classical computers requires approximations because they can’t exactly calculate quantum behaviour of more than just a couple of electrons. “The computations are too large and time-consuming and each simplification reduces the overall accuracy of the calculations, thereby limiting their usefulness. Whereas quantum computing works differently, through phenomena known as entanglement, we are able to describe electron-electron interactions without approximations,” he said and added that quantum computing enables us to model nature as it is, without any simplifications. The research titled ‘Quantum Chemistry Calculations Using Energy Derivatives on Quantum Computers’ was recently featured in the ‘NISQ Computing Newsletter’ by the USRA Research Institute for Advanced Computer Science.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/iiit-h-team-devises-new-way-to-perform-quantum-chemistry-calculations/articleshow/86022854.cms||---

Hemant Gupta, a retired senior clerk at a government bank, sat quietly under a peepal tree, a yellow rope wrapped around his torso. The 64-year-old man had sent multiple letters to authorities to protest against trees that were being felled for a national highway. When he didn’t hear back from them, he decided to take matters into his own hands. “I want to make sure they don’t fell another tree. I’m not against the development of the highway but we must find a way to preserve the trees, perhaps, transplant the younger ones elsewhere,” said Gupta. Gupta is ready to “adopt” the trees and exhaust his savings to bear their transplantation and maintenance expenses. “I will break my fixed deposits if I have to. But our environment must be protected,” he said. Construction work is on at the stretch for the four-lane National Highway-58 which starts from Delhi and connects Rishikesh with Srinagar in Pauri Garhwal. About 16 trees have been marked for felling on a 2km stretch. Later in the day, an official from the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) reached Gupta’s protest site to persuade him to go home. After several hours, the senior citizen left the spot in the evening on the promise that no trees would be felled for the next three days. “He has asked us to give him three days. He will appeal to the forest department officials and district authorities to come up with a plan to save the trees,” said C P Singh, the official. Singh added that since the start of the project in 2013, over 500 trees have been felled after obtaining necessary clearances.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/retd-govt-bank-employee-ties-himself-to-tree-to-protest-felling/articleshow/86018300.cms||Shivani Azad

While the classes concerned were scheduled to restart from Monday, delay in issuing the official order as well as the festival of Pola that is celebrated on a large-scale in rural areas saw poor attendance in classrooms on the first day. The school staff has been asked to undergo Covid vaccination, while members of teaching and non-teaching staff who have not got inoculated so far have been ordered to undergo mandatory RT-PCR testing for joining schools. As per official order, a four-member committee headed by Aurangabad district collector as its president and CEO of ZP, health officer and education officer as its members has been formed to oversee the running of these classes in compliance with Covid prevention norms. “The school heads and local health authorities have been asked to work in coordination. If any student develops symptoms of Covid and tests positive, the particular school must be shut down with immediate effect,” the ZP administration has said. Notably, rural schools from Aurangabad district have already started classes for students from Std VIII and above as per earlier order of the state government. Kailas Gaikwad, general secretary of Aurangabad district ZP Teachers’ Association, said it was welcome move. “While the education of these children had come to standstill since the past one-and-a-half years, the option of online teaching was proving less effective considering different constrains in rural areas. We have appealed to the teaching and non-teaching staff to continue work by following the SOP devised by the authorities,” he said.

Now, he has utilised all his options right from the Bombay high court to Supreme Court. Law must be allowed to take its own course. It’s high time he takes the decision in this regard,” he told the media after his arrival at Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar International airport here. Speaking on the arrest of Karuna Sharma earlier in the day, who claimed to be the second wife of NCP minister Dhananjay Munde, the former chief minister demanded a thorough inquiry into the entire incident. Sharma was held by the Parli police for allegedly hurling casteist remarks at a woman and was remanded to 14 days judicial custody by the Beed court A revolver was also believed to have been recovered from her car by the cops. “Everyone has a right to speak and no one should be stopped from expressing his thoughts. After what happened at Parli, it is clear how the law and order is being maintained. She must be investigated without any external pressure, as the recovery of a revolver from her vehicle is a serious issue,” Fadnavis said. Fadnavis, however, refused to comment on chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, saying he should advise his colleagues in the cabinet and constituent partners on governance. On the performance of Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, the Southwest Nagpur MLA said everyone was trying to outsmart others and there was lack of coordination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/all-legal-options-exhausted-deshmukh-should-face-ed-probe-fadnavis/articleshow/85989871.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Pune||Indian wolves most ancient of surviving lineage, says study||PUNE: Genome sequencing of the Indian wolf, which determined the genetic makeup, has shown that grey wolf populations represent the most ancient surviving lineage among these carnivores. The study conducted in Saswad and Morgaon areas near Pune by the University of California and scientists in India also indicated that the Indian wolf was among the most endangered and its habitat was threatened by human encroachment and land conversion. The authors sequenced genomes of four Indian and two Tibetan wolves and included 31 additional canid genomes to resolve their evolutionary and phylogenomic history. They found that Tibetan and Indian wolves are distinct from each other and from other wolf populations. The research is the first to include genomes of all three major wolf lineages — lupus (grey wolves), rufus (red wolves) and lycaon (a subspecies of grey wolf) — and provided new insights into the grey wolf ’s evolutionary history. The report was published in the journal Molecular Ecology. The study emphasized the urgency of conserving Indian wolves, whose numbers are fewer than 3,000. Other findings suggested that the Indian wolf could be even more basal than the Tibetan wolf, making it the most distantly divergent wolf alive today. Lead author Lauren Hennelly, a doctoral student with the University of California Davis School of Veterinary Medicine’s Mammalian Ecology Conservation Unit, said wolves are one of the last remaining large carnivores in Pakistan, and many of India’s large carnivores are endangered. “Knowing they are so unique and found only here must inspire local people and scientists to learn more about conserving them and their grassland habitats,” she said. Until this study, the evolutionary history of Indian wolves was based on mitochondrial DNA evidence inherited only from the mother. That evidence suggested that the Indian wolf diverged more recently than the Tibetan wolf, Hennelly said. The study used the entire genome — the nuclear DNA containing nearly all of the genes reflecting the wolf’s evolutionary history which showed that the Indian wolf was likely even more divergent than the Tibetan wolf. “This divergent lineage answers the question that could help their conservation at a policy scale which could trickle down and bolster local efforts to protect these wolves,” Hennelly said. Mihir Godbole, founder of the Grasslands Trust for conservation of neglected habitats, said, “We have been working in collaboration with researchers, film-makers, policymakers to conserve the flora and fauna of the region, keeping in mind human welfare at the same time.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/genetic-study-shows-indian-wolves-most-ancient-of-surviving-lineage/articleshow/86020723.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

Sources said that the team, comprising the state police cybercell and the Cyberdome, has identified the IP address from which the hoax mails were sent to CSL officials. The police suspect an insider in CSL could be the sender. “We received a few leads to identify the sender of the threat mails. The statements of a few CSL officials will be collected in the coming days and the accused will be identified and arrested soon,” said a police officer. The emails threatening about a bomb being planted in the premises of the CSL facility which hosts critical assets including the Indigenous Aircraft Carrier-I were received by five CSL officials since August 24. South police has registered an FIR under relevant sections of the IT Act for cyber terrorism and Section 384 of the IPC for extortion. Though police have ensured that there was no actual bomb as the mail sender threatened, the security alert issued at all vital installations in Kochi will continue to be in effect for a few more days. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/bomb-threat-ip-of-sender-identified/articleshow/86020755.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||Why does Shankar Nagar get waterlogged after every rain?||NAGPUR: Occasional waterlogging due to rain is understandable, but repeated instances mean something is amiss. Nagpurians have started suffering from the visibly flawed infrastructure works in the city as was evident following Tuesday’s downpour that saw many busy traffic junctions waterlogged. To the Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s relief, the water drained out before the peak traffic hours at most junctions — barring Shankar Nagar Square, the new moniker of Nagpur’s clogged stormwater drainage system. “The busy junction went under water for the umpteenth time this monsoon,” admitted a senior official from the NMC’s public health engineering department. “The Tuesday morning’s downpour once again inundated Shankar Nagar Square and forced the traffic to move at a snail’s pace,” said N Pramod, a local resident. The public health engineering department official claimed that the state’s public works department, which has undertaken the cement road work from University Campus Square on Amravati Road to Rani Jhansi Square, has damaged the stormwater network near Shankar Nagar Square. “The stormwater network has been clogged between Titan showroom and Shankar Nagar Square,” he claimed. The road concretization work also clogged many inlets of the stormwater network resulting in accumulation of knee deep water at this junction, he said. According to the officer, the NMC had on several occasions brought this to the notice of state PWD officials, including superintending engineer Vidyadhar Sardeshmukh. But no efforts have been made to resolve the problem, he claimed. Though stormwater drain is part of any road, PWD overlooks it while constructing roads, said the official. Like at Shankar Nagar Square, PWD committed similar mistake at several places while constructing the inner ring road. Citing an example, the NMC official said that at Padole Hospital Square too, stormwater network was not laid properly. Sardeshmukh assured to look into the matter raised by the NMC. Motorists too expressed anguish over frequent waterlogging. It has become a regular and agonizing fallout of heavy rain in the city exposing the inefficiency of civic authorities. The NMC must take notice of this recurring problem and come out with a permanent solution, was the general opinion of the motorists. Waterlogging was also spotted in areas including Loha Pul, Padole Hospital Square, Medical College Square, Khamla Road, Smruti Talkies Chowk (Sadar), Tirpude Square, Dhantoli Chowk, Narendra Nagar railway underbridge, LIC Square, Reshimbagh Square, Sadar’s Raj Bhavan bus stop etc. All these waterlogged spots considerably slowed down vehicular movement, resulting in traffic congestion at many other places too. Many residential localities, especially in the city’s outskirts, too witnessed heavy waterlogging. Fire officials said they received calls of rainwater accumulation from Sonegaon, Juni Vasti Khamla Road, parts of North and South Nagpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/why-does-shankar-nagar-get-waterlogged-after-every-rain/articleshow/86020720.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

About 54,000 streetlights will be replaced under this plan, officials say, adding the move is expected to bring down energy consumption by 50%.The Authority on Tuesday allotted a tender of Rs 48.64 crore to Surya Roshni Limited and the work is expected to commence in phases within a month of completing the tender formalities from the date of signing the documents.While the tender is allotted for seven years — which includes operation and maintenance — the work of installing the LED lights is expected to be complete by 2022, officials said.“We had an estimate of Rs 75 crore for installation of LED lights across Greater Noida. About 54,000 will be installed initially,” Salil Yadav, deputy general manager, GNIDA, said. CEO Narendra Bhooshan said the tender allotted will change the modalities of LED installations for future in the state “as it not only includes rational bid price, but also operations and maintenance for seven years”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/gr-noida-to-replace-54k-street-lamps-with-leds/articleshow/86023489.cms||Meenakshi Sinha
---||Noida||Benefits & exemptions may hold key to collusion probe||Noida: The Noida Authority made frequent changes to its rulebook between 2004 and 2012, when most housing projects were approved in the NCR city, and there’s a randomness about benefits and exemptions granted to real estate developers, officials said on Tuesday as a stocktaking of the chronology of decisions in that period raised many eyebrows.Noida Authority officials shared details of five notifications pertaining to changes in building regulations and purchasable floor area ratio (FAR), among others, with the UP government’s four-member special investigation team (SIT), which has been tasked with fixing responsibility after the Supreme Court on August 31 ordered the prosecution of erring officials and the demolition of Supertech’s Emerald Court twin towers, pointing to collusion between Noida officials and the developer.“We were unable to understand what yardstick has been used while doling out benefits and exemptions,” said a senior officer with Noida’s planning division. “It appears that benefits and exemptions were offered according to the revised rules but in an arbitrary manner while violations were ignored or overlooked.”During the course of approvals granted to the Supertech group to revise the original plan for its twin towers, resulting in the project’s height being increased twice to 40 floors eventually, the Noida Authority revised its building regulations twice. Sources said when the Emerald Court allotment was originally made in 2004, the Building Rules of 1986 were applicable. In June 2006, and again in November 2010, the Building Rules were revised. The revised plans for the twin towers were cleared in December 2006, November 2009 and March 2012.Sources said it had also been found that Aster 2, which is the closest Emerald Court building to the twin towers, had been awarded a completion certificate in April 2008. Yet, the construction of a space frame between it and Apex in June 2012 was allowed without the RWA being informed.Broadly, the probe report into collusion is likely to be divided into three sections -- the period between November 2004 and November 2009, the period right after, up to December 2012, before the RWA moved the Allahabad high court, and another one till this August. Though some names will be provided to the state government by Thursday evening, which is the deadline to wrap up the probe, the SIT can ask for more time to ascertain the role of other officials. The SIT is also likely to question the former and present Noida employees and record their statements. On Wednesday, SIT members are likely to visit the twin towers and speak to members of the Emerald Court RWA. The SIT comprises Sanjiv Mittal, who heads it, additional chief secretary (rural development) Manoj Singh, additional director general of Meerut zone Rajeev Sabharwal and chief town and country planner Anoop Srivastava.Noida CEO Ritu Maheshwari, additional CEO Neha Sharma, officer on special duty of group housing Avinash Tripathi and general manager of the planning section Ishtiyaq Ahmed along with senior planning manager Vaibhav Gupta were present during the morning meeting with the SIT. The opinion of Srivastava will be important in determining the culpability of the Authority officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/benefits-exemptions-may-hold-key-to-collusion-probe/articleshow/86023498.cms||Shalabh

Dastagir Chittewan (Jamadar) belonged to a family, which was hired by the Kolhapur royal family to take care of the cheetahs brought from Africa and used for hunting. He was 84. Dastagir had met with a minor accident in his home after which he underwent a leg surgery. Thereafter he had stopped eating. He breathed his last in his house built in 1939 on a plot given to his father, Ismail Chittewan, by the then Kolhapur king Rajaram Maharaj. A photo of Ismail Chittewan holding two cheetahs with a rope hangs proudly in the hall. In the 1900s, Kolhapur had a place called cheetah karkhana or chittekhana, which is at the spot where Vikram High school now stands, to keep the tamed cheetahs. Five people on rotation basis were deployed to take care of one cheetah. Dastagir would go with his father to this cheetah karkhana from the time he was 4 years old. Last year, during an interaction, Dastagir had recalled his childhood memories of accompanying his father who took care of two cheetahs named Bhawani and Shankar. “We belong to the Cheete-pardhi community, which has a tradition of hunting and catching cheetahs for livelihood right from the Mughal era. We came to be known as Cheetewans. My father was appointed by Rajaram Maharaj to train cheetahs and also to travel to South Africa in a ship to carry out cheetah purchase. My father went there thrice,” he had said. He had recalled that cheetahs would recognize their trainers even when they were kept blindfolded. After the practice of hunting declined in the 1960s, the cheetahs were given to Ranichi Baug (a Byculla zoo in Mumbai). Dastidar was excited when he heard the talks of cheetahs being reintroduced in to the wild in India. “Proper research should be done about the animal, and its food habits, only then it will survive,” he had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/last-man-to-see-cheetahs-tamed-for-hunts-passes-away/articleshow/86016366.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

Public representatives in Thane city are offering free travel and vaccination, providing Ganesh idols at nominal rates and conducting decoration competitions ahead of the corporation elections scheduled next year. Shiv Sena MLC Ravindra Phatak, whose wife also is a corporator, is in talks with NGOs to conduct a vaccination drive for the 18-44 age group. Thane guardian minister Eknath Shinde and Kalyan Lok Sabha MP Shrikant Shinde, both from Shiv Sena, have arranged 300 buses for Konkan which will leave from Thane and Kalyan on September 8. Both locations have a dense population of Maharashtrians. Shrikant Shinde said, “Konkan natives have suffered huge losses due to flood and also due to Covid-19 lockdown. So to give them some relief we have arranged these free rides so that they can celebrate Ganeshotsav with their relatives. All buses will be sanitized before the journey and all passengers will be required to wear masks during the journey and follow Covid norms. We have also distributed 400 Ganpati idols at a nominal cost to families who were unable to buy as they faced a financial crisis.” Milind Patil, NCP corporator from Kalwa, said the party has arranged four bus services from Kalwa and elsewhere for people travelling home for the festival. MNS has hired 100 buses to ferry devotees to their native Konkan. “We are also conducting workshops for household idol decorations, arranging a mobile immersion van and offering free auto rides for idol visarjan in Naupada,” said Avinash Jadhav, Thane-Palghar district president.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/parties-offer-voters-free-bus-rides-to-konkan-for-ganpati/articleshow/86022841.cms||Manoj Badgeri
---||Noida||Detained for over 24 hrs: Farmers to NHRC||Noida: Farmers have approached the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) over the “unlawful detention” of more than 40 people during the three-day protest march to the Noida Authority’s office last week over. Lawyer Sunil Awana,representing farmers’ leader Sukhvir Pahelwan, in a complaint has alleged that around 40 farmers were detained under CrPC section 151 (2) either on August 31 or on September 1 and 2, and had not been released after 24 hours. The CrPC section 151 (2) says no person detained shall be in custody for a period exceeding 24 hours from the time he or she is picked up unless further detention is required or authorised under any other provisions of CrPC or of any other law for the time being in force. Advocates and family members of the detained farmers, however, alleged that the police delayed the release of the farmers deliberately.Advocate Karamveer Singh, who is representing several farmers arrested under the provision, told TOI that an executive magistrate can prepare a release bond within 24 hours and order release of the farmers.“After a person is arrested under CrPC 151 (2), his personal bond can be filled by his lawyer and submitted to the magistrate’s court. However, when lawyers and family members approached the magistrate court in Surajpur, the officials asked to visit the magistrate office in Sector 6. The family members and lawyers were made to run here and there, which delayed the filing of personal bonds. Despite the fact that there is no necessity of a personal bond to be submitted by the lawyer representing the accused, the police delayed the release order to weaken the protest,” he said.Karamveer alleged that the release orders were issued on Monday and Tuesday for only 22 farmers after the Luksar jailor requested the police not to send farmers in bulk as they had to make special preparations in the jail keeping the Covid protocols in mind. Additional Commissioner of Police (law and order) Love Kumar said several farmers have been released on Tuesday after their personal bonds were received by police. ACP-1 (central Noida) Abdul Qadir said, “Their personal bonds came on Monday and their release orders were issued on Tuesday,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/detained-for-over-24-hrs-farmers-to-nhrc/articleshow/86023503.cms||Shikha Salaria

They claimed that the livelihood of lakhs of people has been hit and the ban will also fuel migration from the hills. The Uttarakhand high court has put a ban on the pilgrimage due to the pandemic. The ban has been challenged in the Supreme Court by the state government. Suresh Semwal, the chairman of Gangotri Mandir Samiti, said, “We are not against any political event. But it is surprising that the annual pilgrimage is not being held due to Covid-19 scare. But, for political events there is no scare. They are attended by thousands of people.” Semwal said, “The yatra was the main source of income for many. Its closure for almost two years will lead to migration from the hills now.” Brijesh Sati, spokesperson of Char Dham Tirth Purohit Mahapanchayat, told TOI that the locals were staging protests and walking towards the revered shrine with their request to open them for the devotees. “Our teams are running campaigns, under which villagers are being contacted. Their support is being sought for scrapping the Char Dham Devsthanam Management Board Act and start of the yatra again,” he said. Sati further added that the protests would be intensified soon to draw the attention of the state government. When contacted, government spokesperson and state’s agriculture minister Subodh Uniyal said, “We had made an attempt to open the yatra for residents of three districts, which house the four revered shrines. But the decision was challenged in high court. Any further action can be taken only after the directions from the court now.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/thousands-can-gather-for-political-rallies-but-not-for-pilgrimage-char-dham-priests/articleshow/86018341.cms||Kautilya Singh

The delegation highlighted how hundreds of patients will suffer and may face complications availing of medical insurances for no fault of theirs. Among the delegation that met Kumar was former Ahmedabad Medical Association (AMA) president Mona Desai. “We have only requested that all be treated equal before law. We have instances where many commercial units, including hotels, continue to function in the same commercial building where hospitals have been sealed for lack of BU permission. Ahead of the third wave, many mid-size and small hospitals that played a pivotal role during the pandemic will be forced to close. There are an estimated 40,000 clinics and hospitals without BU permission across nagarpalikas and villages in Gujarat,” said Desai. Dr Nilesh Shah pointed out how smaller hospitals, which form the bulk of Covid healthcare inventory in the city, will suffer. Of the 700 clinics and small hospitals in the city, nearly 60 per cent were designated as Covid hospitals. “We shall abide by the law, but our only petition is that it should be equitably implemented, be it hospital, commercial unit, office or residence.” Other doctors also pointed out how the withdrawal of C-forms on Monday has put hundreds of patients in a fix. “Many will be shifted in 2-3 days to other hospitals. Following the withdrawal of forms, medical insurance companies can cause problems for patients,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hospital-sealing-doctors-meet-civic-chief/articleshow/86020795.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Meanwhile, the Saibaba Colony police collected CCTV footage from the bakery and nearby commercial establishments and found it was a case of murder. They arrested Mani on Monday night. “After Bakyaraj’s death, we had registered a case under Section 174 of the Criminal Procedure Code. Later, it was altered to a case under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/man-held-for-murdering-tea-shop-worker/articleshow/86020787.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

On Tuesday, the residents of Osman Nagar on the city’s fringes were seen wading through knee-deep water in an attempt to shift their valuables to a safer place, while some of them were helplessly waiting for the water level to go down. “Since the last floods, we hardly had any respite from this situation. The entire area gets inundated and our houses are flooded with water after every spell of rain. Due to multiple incidents of inundation, the foundations of our houses are gradually deteriorating,” said Afreen Begum, whose house is surrounded by slush and sewage from the overflowing drains in the area. As the monsoon keeps them on tenterhooks, angry locals alleged that the civic authorities have ignored their pleas requesting the officials to drain out excess water and provide a permanent solution to the problem. A 60-year-old resident, Syed Faheem, said, “After education minister Sabitha Indira Reddy inspected the area recently, the officials of Jalpally municipality have begun the reconstruction work of Osman Nagar Lake bund but it was of no use. We need a permanent solution.” The bund, which stretches across one km and is about 12 feet wide, is being constructed to protect the water from protecting the houses. The municipality is reconstructing the damaged bund with a special fund of Rs 20 lakh sanctioned by the Rangareddy district collector on the representation of minister Sabitha Indra Reddy. Officials, however, said that they cannot provide a permanent solution as the houses were built on the lake’s full tank level (FTL) area and the case is still pending in high court. Agreeing that several houses are still suffering from the impact of last year’s floods, G Praveen Kumar, commissioner, Jalpally municipality said, “The area is still affected because the houses are constructed in the lake FTL area. We cannot take up any measures to offer a permanent solution because the case is still pending in high court.” However, the commissioner said that they are taking all necessary measures to drain out the water by clearing inlet and outlet channels of the drains. It was in September last year that the first bout of heavy rainfall inundated Osman Nagar on the outskirts of Hyderabad. The area remained waterlogged for about six months at a stretch before the officials took measures to drain out the floodwater. However, a year since the area experienced waterlogging and the floods that created havoc in the entire city, nothing seems to have changed for the residents of nearly 300 houses that are once again flooded with excess water from the nearby Osman Nagar Lake.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/1500-homeless-as-osman-nagar-flooded-again/articleshow/86020776.cms||Moulika.KV

Congress also demanded compensation to the farmers whose crops have been damaged due to rains and floods. ”At least Rs 10,000 per acre compensation should be paid to the farmers for damages to their crops due to continuous heavy rains.

The CM spoke to chief secretary Somesh Kumar over phone and enquired about the flood situation in various districts in the state. He instructed the chief secretary to put district collectors and the official machinery on high alert and make arrangements to rescue and rehabilitate those affected. He said that officials should monitor all lakes, tanks and rivulets which have received heavy inflows due to rains in rural areas and drains and nalas in the city and towns to ensure that no untoward incidents take place. All officials and employees of the municipal administration, panchayat raj, roads and buildings, electricity departments should be asked to keep a watch in their respective jurisdictions, he said. “People living in the low-lying areas should not be put to any difficulties and for this, the irrigation department officials should take all the necessary measures. Alternative arrangements and rehabilitation arrangements should be made by the district administrations,” the CM said. He directed the chief secretary that disaster management teams should be put on standby in the backdrop of the MeT department issuing warnings. “All elected representatives must stay put in their respective constituencies and areas and coordinate with the government machinery and the people. People should stay indoors, especially those living in low-lying areas,” KCR said. Following the directions of the CM, chief secretary Somesh Kumar held a tele-conference with collectors of 20 flood- affected districts and took stock of the prevailing situation in the districts.

---||Ahmedabad||‘Weak link between grit, choosing science’||Ahmedabad: Are students choosing science different from those choosing business or humanities at high school level? When it comes to behavioural traits, there’s no major correlation, claims a study carried out by a team of researchers. They stressed on the choice part along with cognitive abilities. The study ‘Science Education and Labour Market Outcomes in a Developing Economy’ published in ‘Economic Inquiry’ has been authored by Tarun Jain from IIM Ahmedabad, Abhiroop Mukhopadhyay from Indian Statistical Institute, Nishith Prakash from University of Connecticut, and Raghav Rakesh from Michigan State University. They had carried out a primary survey on 524 students in Class 12 in 44 schools in Andhra Pradesh and Bihar to find traits of science and non-science students based on tests to ascertain ambiguity aversion, positive personality traits and Cognitive Reflection Test. “The scores do not differ by stream choice. We found a weak correlation between grit and the likelihood of studying science,” mentioned the paper. The paper argued that choosing science at high school level improves earning potential. But the study points at a larger picture. The paper argues that complementary skills – ranging from English to computer and communication to technical – are the real key to change. “Scientific temperament is valuable. The government should invest in better science teachers, science labs in all schools, as well as computer and language training before students leave school,” said Prof Jain, a professor of economics at IIM-A. In Gujarat, experts said that taking science is more common in urban areas due to factors ranging from socio-economic to aptitude and information about future prospects. Kirit Joshi, former principal of Diwan Ballubhai School, said, “One must not link just science education with money, but also to ensure that these students contribute to innovation, technology and societal development. Career counselling at an early stage could also prove to be beneficial.” (With inputs from Bharat Yagnik)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/weak-link-between-grit-choosing-science/articleshow/86020912.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Kochi||Cops: Accused admitted to burying Idukki woman alive||IDUKKI: The accused in the Panikkankudy murder has admitted to the police that he has buried the woman alive. Police on Tuesday took Manikkunel Benoy, 48, to collect evidence from the spot where he had murdered and buried Thamadathil Sindhu, 44, whose body was exhumed from the kitchen of Benoy’s house. Police who arrested Benoy on Monday took him to the spot with tight security at 10am on Tuesday. Benoy showed police the room where he quarrelled with Sindhu. Idukki DSP Immanuel Paul said that the accused strangled the woman during the quarrel and she fell unconscious. “Believing that she was dead, the accused took her to a pit on the backside of his house and poured kerosene over her body and set on fire. When she cried loudly he returned her to the room. Then he made a pit under the stove and buried her alive.” The DSP said the accused revealed that to ensure her death he covered her face with a plastic cover while burying her. “When placing the body inside the pit, the accused found that her leg was moving but still he buried her,” the officer said. DSP Paul said that last month Sindhu, who had started living with Benoy recently, visited her ex-husband, who is a cancer patient. Knowing about this, Benoy asked to return immediately. He even tried to hang her son inside the home and hearing his cries through the phone she returned home immediately. “Benoy turned suspicious about Sindhu and this led to the crime. Based on the complaint of the family, we have registered another case of murder attempt too against the accused,” he said. Police will also examine the Ponmudy dam area where her clothes were abandoned and the shop at Nedumkandam from where he purchased a mobile phone, in addition to the places he had stayed after committing the crime. The incident came to light after Sindhu’s mother filed a man missing complaint with Vellathooval police on August 15. Police on Saturday exhumed her body after the relatives found the body buried inside the kitchen of Benoy’s house. Postmortem report also revealed signs of serious assault. One rib was broken and the body had several injury marks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cops-accused-admitted-to-burying-idukki-woman-alive/articleshow/86020963.cms||---

The court had stayed the three laws, that had caused protests in New Delhi, and appointed a three-member committee to submit its report after consulting stakeholders, including farmers. The letter by Ghanavat reads, “As a member of the committee representing the farmers, I am pained that the issue has not been resolved and the farmers’ protest continues. I feel that the report has not been give any attention by the court.” Ghanavat has urged the report should be made public for implementation of its recommendations. This would help end the stalemate to the farmers’ satisfaction, he said.

No one can exercise undue influence over the government, the administration, and the judiciary,” Munde tweeted, in an indirect attack on her estranged cousin (Dhananjay Munde). Without mentioning Sharma-Munde or her cousin, Munde added: “It is not that injustice takes place when power lies in the hands of the wrong people, but when the brave remain mute spectators.” BJP state vice-president and former minister Ram Shinde, meanwhile, alleged that Karuna Sharma-Munde was being framed as a part of a larger conspiracy. “The chain of events leaves scope for the suspicion that Karuna Sharma-Munde is being framed. We demand a thorough probe into the matter,” he said while speaking to the media in neighbouring Ahmednagar district. On Sharma-Munde allegedly being stopped from holding a press conference at Parli on September 6 — during which she was supposed to “expose” her husband — Shinde said democracy gives every citizen the right to express his/her views. Neither Dhananjay Munde nor the NCP had issued an official statement on the matter till Tuesday evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/pankaja-reacts-to-sharma-munde-issue-on-twitter/articleshow/86018365.cms||---

The task force has commenced discussions with large multinationals operating in the state and other places to attract investments and take up expansion projects in the district Arjun Prakash, chairman, district chapter of CII, said while nurturing existing business, it was also important to explore emerging business opportunities and prepare a point of penetration. “Electronics is definitely an area for Coimbatore, especially in view of the new talent pool that has shaped up in the district in this decade. We have the potential to capture 30%-40% of the state’s electronics manufacturing output, which is likely to be valued at $40 billion by 2025.” Other senior functionaries of CII said while the district was known for foundry, pumps, valves, textiles, jewellery and wet grinders, the share of electronics has not been so high. But the district has great potential in electronics, with its capabilities in precision engineering and manufacturing. CII functionaries also urged the industry players to utilize this space, which could provide direct employment to more than 10,000 people and indirect employment to 40,000 to 60,000 people, while boosting the local consumer economy. Pointing out that healthcare was becoming increasingly digital driven, Prashanth S, vice-chairman, district chapter of CII, said a home-grown electronics industry that focuses on digital health could capture a significant portion of the market. Industrialists said the CII was positioning the district as an important destination for channelling investments during meetings with state and central government authorities. “It aims to understand the challenges in electronics manufacturing and aid the growth of the industry by developing a road map,” they said. On its part, CII is hoping to work for an electronics cluster in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/cii-to-develop-electronics-sector-in-district/articleshow/86020815.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

An election department official said the list would be published by merging all additions and correction of names ahead of the municipal elections. The electoral roll would concentrate on the “one family one booth” concept with the election officials ensuring that families with similar surnames and were from the same areas and buildings were kept together to ensure that they could cast their ballots in the same booth. “The voters can avail of the facility of ‘family tagging’ requests. This would bring all the voters of a family in the same polling booth. The draft roll will be published on November 1,” an official said. This is being carried out according to the directions of the Election Commission of India (ECI). State chief electoral officer Shrikant Deshpande told TOI, “The ‘one family one booth’ will help listing of families under one booth. The ECI has stated that at the time of publication of the draft roll 2022, the final roll, along with the supplementary prepared during continuous updates, will be integrated after deleting names and clubbing family members. Our office is accordingly doing the work.” The state has 8.99 crore voters and the process of addition and deletion is on. Nearly 58,573 names are duplicate entries, which are now being checked for the deletion process.

---||Dehradun||U’khand bans ‘virtual immersion’ of ashes in Ganga after protests from priestsSheo S Jaiswal | TNN||Haridwar: A proposed initiative to allow ‘virtual immersion’ of ashes in Ganga was shelved by the state government after stiff opposition from priests in Haridwar who argued that the practise would “tamper with centuries-old tradition” and snatch away their “rights to conduct the ritual”. The proposal was mooted by the Uttarakhand Sanskrit Academy — a government-run body for promotion of Sanskrit — and was aimed especially at non-resident Indians (NRIs). According to plan, ashes could be sent by courier for immersion. The academy would then cover the ritual live and stream it online for the family. The idea received immediate blowback from the priest community which said that it “violated their rights of immersion”. The protesting priests had said that ash immersion was a matter between a person and his family priest (kul purohit). “No one can come between the two,” Ganga Sabha, a priest body that manages Har-ki-Pauri, had warned. The priests threatened to launch an agitation if the plan came into force and received backing from the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), a right-wing organisation. On Sunday, a delegation of Ganga Sabha and VHP members met chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami to raise their concerns. A day later, the government announced that the initiative had been scrapped. Anand Bhardwaj, secretary of the academy, told TOI that an announcement to scrap the digital immersion initiative was made by state minister for Sanskrit education Arvind Pandey in Roorkee. The proposal, called Mukti Yojna, had followed a resolution adopted by the academy in September last year. According to Bhardwaj, “The initiative was a response to the needs of over three crore NRIs. The ash immersion mechanism does not cater to them.” Ganga Sabha general secretary Tanmaya Vashishth said they were aware of the issues faced by NRIs when it comes to immersion of ashes. “We are mulling a system to help NRIs identify their family priests who could do the rituals for them. We will also work on a method through which ashes will reach the priests,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-bans-virtual-immersion-of-ashes-in-ganga-after-protests-from-priestssheo-s-jaiswal-tnn/articleshow/86018396.cms||Sheo S Jaiswal

It heard the state government’s appeal against Bombay high court’s March 5, 2021, order that upheld payment to Manaj Tollway as per consent terms. In 2013, Manaj was given a four-laning and improvement works contract for two state highways. In 2015, it opted out and invoked arbitration. A bench of Justice M R Shah and Aniruddha Bose asked why the state was challenging the decision to pay Manaj when it was signed by officers and had received the governor’s approval. Senior advocate Paramjit Singh Patwalia for Maharashtra said massive loss has been caused to the exchequer due to nod to consent terms. The judges questioned if it is a loss to the exchequer what action was taken against the officers responsible. They said before they consider the appeal, they would like to know if the state will initiate action against the officers. They posted the hearing on September 13.

---||Chennai||Seeds of a financial hub in Chennai’s soil||By K S Vijay ElangovaCHENNAI: As an established port of trade of British India since the 1600s, Chennai has always had the flair and intrinsic attributes to be a vibrant financial hub. The announcement in the Budget by Tamil Nadu finance minister P T R Palanivel Thiaga Rajan allocating 60 acres, which may not match the ambition, around the Nandambakkam Trade Centre to set up a financial city is a welcome move for various reasons including the deep understanding of Chennai’s potential for a thriving market hub. As a second most developed economy in the country as per the gross state domestic product, the Tamil Nadu government had been amnesiac not to project and develop Chennai as a major financial hub. As a major manufacturing and information technology hub in addition to being a thriving market place, the city had the organic latency to become a vibrant financial centre in the country with its strategic location and good connectivity. As a mixed economy with a large manufacturing and IT services base, Chennai always attracted substantial flow of foreign investments as seen in the presence of world’s top multinational companies operating in the city. The presence of a large financial talent pool, vibrant export and import trade, effective international sea and air connectivity, significant knowledge capital, better geographical positioning than the fledgling Gujarat International Finance Tec (GIFT) City in terms of connecting east and west and the presence of major global banks, should propel Chennai to become one of the major financial hubs. Meanwhile, building other extensive networks, setting up the medium for free flow of capital, a sound fiscal legal system, building a firm base for a full range of financial products and a simple and low tax regime (incumbent on the Centre), are the most wanting attributes that the state needs to vigorously pursue policies to build. However, to be counted among the global financial cities, it is imperative to be part of the bourses. The lack of one in the city, puts Chennai on the back foot. The Madras Stock Exchange, started in 1937, was the first for south India, but it whimpered to a halt in 2015 due to the absence of substantial trading and the political will and vision to sustain it. It would have been historic had we still had it competing with other exchanges in the country such as Mumbai. Chennai’s gross regional product is pegged at a good $78 billion, and $200 billion with industrial zones in terms of purchasing power parity, with a number of thriving domestic and international businesses. Mumbai exchange these days does not inspire as much as it does not make much difference to its growth. It is regrettable the Chennai has been left behind while cities such as Bengaluru and Hyderabad have overtaken it in the past few years. Chennai has prospects for an all-round development on the lines of cities such as Sydney, which is seen moving to attract major investments while trying to project itself as a possible successor to Hong Kong. Chennai has similar characteristics to Sydney, which astoundingly contributes, as a mixed economy, one fourth of Australia’s gross domestic product ($461 billion as per purchasing power parity). Almost three decades have elapsed since the 1990s globalisation thrust, and the potential of the city has not been nurtured effectively. But new negotiations on these lines have started raising hopes that Chennai can soon be the address of a major global financial services sector. Among global financial hubs, Hong Kong’s rise shows it did not take much time to become a major finance industry after ceeding to the British in 1842 by the Nanking treaty. Hong Kong’s manufacturing base also positively impacted its rapid growth as a key global financial services market. Taking cue from Hong Kong’s experience on how financial services hubs thrive, the primary attribute can be found in the transparent regulations related to global standards. The present finance minister with his global financial expertise could help strengthen Chennai’s position. The catharsis from the earlier trend can be slightly painful as he is set to pitch in austerity measures to tackle public debt and possible increase in local taxes to tide over the fall in the revenue due to the pandemic, in the short term, while pursuing plans to develop Chennai as a major financial hub for the future.

Before reaching out to the target, he would study their background and accordingly would start a conversation.” The accused would win over the confidence of his targets and then would convince them to come to the bank for signing up for the loan process.

---||Chennai||Interrupted by pandemic, campus culture is the crucial link for students||By Paul WilsonChennai: As Tamil Nadu and a few other states resume on-campus classes for schools and colleges it is imperative to understand the priority of the institutions. Is it just academic excellence or all-round development? Beyond prizes and scores, learning in schools and colleges is intertwined with values, culture and ethics that help shape the personality of students leading to a sustainable perception to the institutions. But pandemic dispensation has shifted the priority of teachers, students and parents. In 2020, after the first wave of Covid-19, fear of the disease was all-encompassing. There was apprehension on the part of parents about sending their wards for on- campus classes due to lack of vaccination. But after more than a year at home, parents have realised the importance of social learning that happens through on campus mode, appealing to the transformation of a student’s personality. In the race for a career, we often fail to recognise the implications of cultural and emotional intelligence that students get acquainted with through on campus learning. Education can never be envisaged as just an intellectual acquaintance or cognitive deposition, rather it encompasses personality development through social learning on campus. Over the past year, teaching and learning, could very well be associated with distance education mode. Any educational campus would be associated with the tangible cultural heritage that helps in comprehensive development of students. Students often identify themselves with physical spaces in a college or school such as cafeteria, hostels, stone benches, temple or chapel and green spaces that contribute to informal chats, building relationships and gaining negotiation skills. Add to this the cultural heritage of educational institutions that are passed on from senior folks to freshers in a college or school. Events like auditions for scouting talent, intercollegiate or school cultural programmes, NSS and NCC, help develop interests and personality traits of a student community characteristic of a given institution. The retention capacity of nostalgic memories of students through their on-campus engagement with tangible and intangible cultural heritage as part of campus life has profound influence on the legacy, institutional perception, resilient capacity during crisis, sustainability of the institution through the consistent admissions and placement even amidst economic breakdown. Pandemic dispensation has triggered cultural disengagement owing to the lack of access to campus life. Though many institutions are making efforts in mitigating the cultural disengagement through events on the digital platform, the essence of the real time and face-to-face collaborations among students is missing for a meaningful engagement through affective learning. Cultural disengagement has a potential threat of facilitating the evolution of counter culture by students (freshers) and it may or may not resonate with the institutional values and the mainstream culture of the institution. To neutralise the effects of the cultural shift over the past year, cultural rehabilitation is necessary through engagement of freshers with the alumni for cultural continuity. Reopening of educational institutions should not be perceived as just an opportunity to complete the syllabus. Authorities need to use it as an opportunity to check cultural disengagement among students when they return. It is the responsibility of the teachers to go beyond the staggered behavioural patterns of students, if any, and consciously make efforts to conserve the cultural heritage for a progressive institutional perception and sustainability.

A portion, about 300-metre of the bridge, was destroyed late Monday night. The temporary structure was built after 57-year-old Ranipokhari bridge collapsed on August 27 due to heavy rainfall. Built by putting together large cement pipes, with a lair of mud on it, the bridge was opened to traffic on Sunday. It didn’t last two days of rain and collapsed Monday night, leaving long queues of passersby trapped on both sides. No one was injured and the traffic was diverted to another route. NP Singh, chief engineer, Public Works Department (PWD), Dehradun, said, “The heavy flow of water washed away the temporary structure. But we managed to repair the damaged portion by late Tuesday evening. If we get more days without rain, we will prepare a permanent structure for water to pass through. Over 40 pipes are being laid which will facilitate passing of water and will not affect any structure over it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/gone-in-2-days-a-bridge-connecting-rishikesh-to-dehradun-washed-away-in-rain/articleshow/86018422.cms||---

It is an initiative by the Union environment ministry where every state and union territory is provided a broad framework, based on which they have to formulate a detailed action plan towards its biodiversity conservation. Goa has formed a 45-member team, one of the largest for any state programme, spanning from varied domains from agriculture to architecture, besides those involved in conservation efforts. The first meeting of the committee was held on Tuesday and the two-hour long meeting was chaired by environment minister Nilesh Cabral. Member secretary of Goa State Biodiversity Board, Pradeep Sarmokadam, said that while Karnataka has framed its biodiversity action plan in the shortest time frame so far of 15 months, Goa should aim to complete the effort within six months. He said work of the plan’s implementation can then begin at the earliest. “We already have a biodiversity plan, which has been framed earlier. But it is mainly a meticulous documentation of Goa’s biodiversity. With that document already being there, we now need a strategy and plan to implement to take the conservation forward. The document should be such that even the common person can refer to it and learn how to conserve biodiversity on his or her individual level,” he said. At the same time, the strategy and action plan should serve as a policy document, which various departments can refer to frame schemes taking biodiversity conservation into consideration. On Tuesday, various committees and sub-committees were formed to take forward the work of framing the action plan. Committees have been formed to draw up plans on the themes of vulnerable ecosystems, coastal and marine ecosystems, sustainable practices, traditional knowledge, among others. Among the suggestions received from the committee members at the first meeting was to promote use of eco-friendly material by government departments to renovate springs and traditional drains and other waterways. Members suggested that only local fruit bearing trees should be planted as part of urban beautification.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-to-frame-biodiversity-action-plan-within-six-months/articleshow/86020991.cms||---

The families had been staying at JJ Nagar in Nilayoor near Thiruparankundram in 22 huts. Though their house was on patta land they didn’t have electricity connection. Children of the community depended on street lights for their studies. When the plight of these families was brought to the notice of the minister, he sent officials to the colony and asked them to take steps to provide electricity. M R Murugan, president of the kattunaicker community, says 22 families got pattas for the land in different periods, 10 in 2004, two in 2007 and another ten in 2014. As they lived in tent-like houses, they had not been able to get electricity. Two street lights were their only relief during the night and funerals and other ceremonies were performed in pitch darkness if held at night. ``When lights started burning in six houses, it was like Diwali. Four more houses are to get it soon and the remaining houses when they complete construction,’’ he said. Murugan says that while 22 of them were given patta in J J Nagar, 33 got it in Veder Pulliankulam. ``Our wish is that all 52 families live in the same area as we are a close-knit community which depends on some of the males to look after the women when we go to far-off places due to our nomadic lifestyle,’’ he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/20-years-on-tribal-colony-gets-power/articleshow/86020887.cms||---

A proposal regarding regularisation was approved and orders were issued accordingly. The civic body will start implementing this scheme from the next week,” Prithviraj Sutar, the leader of Shiv Sena in the PMC, said. A delegation of Sena leaders met the minister in Mumbai earlier this week. They raised the pending civic issues with him. Sutar said according to the earlier policy, TDR could be used for construction along six-metre roads. It should be restarted. Many small property owners would benefit from the move. It was a key demand of the delegation, he said. He said the existing rules giving priority to local residents must be followed strictly during the recruitment process for the Metro rail project. A meeting regarding a recruitment drive would be conducted next week. The demand for implementing the Seventh Pay Commission recommendations for the civic employees was also raised.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/new-gunthewari-regularisation-to-start/articleshow/86020871.cms||---

The study was conducted by Ajeevika Bureau, a non-profit organisation working on the issues of migrant workers. The report, titled, ‘Surveying fire hazards in the textile hub of Narol’ was released on Tuesday. The report is based on a survey, interviews and focus group discussions with 95 workers employed at 30 large processing factories in Narol, a hub of the garments and textiles industry in the south-eastern part of Ahmedabad. These factories employ 500 persons on average. “It is abysmal that at 94% of units, workers have not been trained on using fire extinguishers. Fire safety compliance is poor. In the past year, we saw seen a couple of major fires and several minor ones. As these factories don’t comply with fire safety rules, workers there are the ones at risk,” said Mahesh Gajeria, programme manager, Ajeevika Bureau told TOI. “It is unfortunate that fire extinguishers, the most basic piece of fire safety equipment, are not available at so many units. There are many other areas of non-compliance,” Gajera said. Fire safety is in general compromised at various levels at industrial units. For instance, 72% of units have exposed live wires and 92% do not have fire hydrants available, the study found. As these are textile processing units, most use and store flammable materials. Yet, 98% of units have neither on-site emergency plans or fire alarms. At least 94% of workers reported no training or information given on occupational hazards in their work, the report states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/no-fire-extinguisher-in-26-of-narol-units/articleshow/86020900.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Police arrested Shahnawaz Saifi for allegedly murdering his wife Sadaf (22). The couple has a three-year-old daughter. Madhukar Kad, senior inspector of Mumbra police station, said, “Early on Wednesday, he strangled his wife, tried to burn her body and boarded a train to Moradabad with his daughter.” “The victim’s father tried calling her on the phone. He informed his kin to check their residence. When they reached the place, they found the body of the woman and their daughter was missing, while the gas had spread across the the apartment,” Kad added. Police said the accused, a welder, met the victim online, after which they fell in love and married. But their lifestyles did not match and they quarrelled frequently as he did not like her working, said the officer. She was adamant about working, which triggered off his rage, so he decided to kill her after watching crime serials online. Initially, he strangled her and burned parts of her body. He then let the gas cylinder leak but her kin reached the spot and the blast did not trigger off, the officer told TOI. The accused was found on a train at Itarsi station with the help of RPF and was brought back and arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/man-strangles-wife-tries-to-pass-if-off-as-death-due-to-gas-leak/articleshow/86023001.cms||Nishikant Karlikar

According to a senior police officer, based on a tip that a few Bangladeshi nationals were staying in rental rooms near a knitwear firm at Chinnakarunaipalayam, Avinashi police sub-inspector Kathickthangam and team had verified their documents on Tuesday morning. “The eight were working with the knitwear unit. They had come down to the district some six months ago and joined the unit work by producing fake Aadhaar cards that had addresses from West Bengal. The police team has seized the fake identity cards from them. They did not have any valid passport and visa to stay in India. So, the team has arrested them,” the officer said. The arrested were identified as Jakir Hussain, 23, Alamin, 29, Litton, 30, Biplop Hussain, 23, Ridoyan, 23, Mochin Hussain, 33, Rana Charprasi, 22 and Balbul Ahamed, 32, natives of Dhaka, Madaripur and Gazipur in Bangladesh. “They crossed the India border in West Bengal and managed to obtain fake Aadhaar cards from there. Later, they moved to Tirupur district for work. While the textile sector in Bangladesh is famous worldwide, we don’t know why they are working in the garment units in Tirupur under the guise of Indians,” the officer said. During inquiry, he said, they told us that they had come down to Tirupur as they were struggling to make a living in their home country. The Avinashi police have registered a case against them under Sections 14A(b) read with 3 (2)(a) and 3 (2)(c) of the Foreigners Act, 1946, and produced before a judicial magistrate court, which remanded them in judicial custody. They were later lodged in the Puzhal Central Prison in Chennai. On September 5, the Tirupur South police had arrested four Bangladeshi nationals for their illegal stay in the city. They were also working in a garment unit and residing in a rental house. Police nabbed them when they came to offer prayers at a mosque near Tirupur old bus stand. Similarly, five Bangladeshis were arrested near Mangalam in Tirupur district for illegal stay on August 19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/eight-bangladeshi-nationals-jailed-for-illegal-stay/articleshow/86020879.cms||---

The number of Covid cases have been declining steadily and so has the number of people in need of oxygen support for treatment, said health authorities in Nashik. Considering the data, health authorities have said that, although the situation does not seem worrisome at the moment, there has been a concern regarding the rising number of cases in some pockets as well as an increase in hospitalisation. “The number of critical patients has reduced during the past three months. However, in the last few days, there has been a marginal rise in Covid patients. With festivities almost underway and restrictions more or less being removed, we are keeping a close watch on the situation,” Dr Ashok Thorat, civil surgeon at Nashik Civil Hospital told TOI. As per data provided by the district health authorities, 239 persons required ventilator or oxygen support on July 6 and the number dropped to 159 by August 6. The number dropped further to 106 persons on September 6. The number of coronavirus patients on O2 support was 207 on July 6. The figure declined to 139 on August 6 and the figure stood at 106 on September 6. However, there has been a slight increase of 11 patients on ventilator support in the last one month. The officer also pointed out that the number of active cases in the district decreased from 2,164 on July 6 to 946 on September 6. The officer, however, said that the number of people on ventilator support was higher and most of the cases were comorbid. “The numbers are not very disturbing, but surely people need to be careful,” the officer added. The health authorities further pointed out that people, who were critical and admitted to the hospital for oxygen support, did not include vaccinated persons. “Most persons requiring oxygen or ventilator support were either comorbid and from the age-group of 30 to 70 years. However, of these patients none were even partially vaccinated,” said Dr Jitendra Dhaneshwar, in-charge of Bytco Municipal Hospital. “Until July, we had about 50 patients, who were either partially vaccinated and required oxygen support, but that is not the case these days. Getting vaccinated cuts down the risk involved,” the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/steady-decline-in-patients-needing-o2-support-in-nashik/articleshow/86018442.cms||Abhilash Botekar

The layout mapping of the proposed highway was held a few weeks back in the Shiye-Kerle village stretch in Kolhapur. Now, Kolhapur MP Sanjay Mandlik and former Shiv Sena MLA Chandradeep Narke have demanded the cancellation of the proposed four-laning work. Mandlik even met the district collector along with the villagers. “The farmers in Shiye, Bhuye, Bhuyewadi, Nigwe Dumala, Kushire, Jatharwadi, Padwalwadi, Kerle, and Kerli villages will become landless if the proposal goes through. In these areas, sugar cane is grown on a large scale. Even many industrial units are located here. All these will be affected by the road-widening work. Since the villagers are protesting the project, it should be cancelled,” Mandlik said. Narke added: “The layout mapping work of the Nagpur-Ratnagiri national highway, which was recently taken up by the National Highway Authority’s Solapur division, has not been done properly. The highway will further increase the threat of floods in the Kolhapur city and adjacent villages. An outer ring road is also proposed via these villages. Therefore, at least the Nagpur-Ratnagiri National Highway should be diverted via the Shiroli-Wathar-Warna Nagar-Borpadale stretch.” Around 400 villagers have given a signed an appeal addressed to the district collector to cancel the four-laning work. Rohit Patil, of Bhuyewadi village, said, “Around 300 acre of high-yielding farmland of 400 farmers will be acquired for the proposed work. The farmers here possess small land parcels and if they too are acquired, then how will we survive?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/kolhapur-mp-wants-4-laning-of-highway-cancelled/articleshow/86016458.cms||---

The state organisation has so measured land at five villages in Purandar tehsil. It has completed 98% of land measurement work for the proposed western ring road project. MSRDC executive engineer Sandeep Patil said the authorities wanted to complete the land survey for the eastern ring road by December. “We are calculating valuations of the land that will be acquired for the western ring road. The state government has stated that the compensation will be given to the farmers on the line of the Samruddhi Mumbai-Nagpur highway project. As a result, the farmers are likely to get almost five times more than the existing rates. This will mae the land acquisition process smooth.” The 69km proposed western ring road and the 105km proposed eastern ring road are crucial to the new ring road plan around Pune and PImpri Chinchwad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/eastern-ring-road-land-measurement-work-begins/articleshow/86020893.cms||---

The 63-year-old covers all the streets in ward 81 of Madurai Corporation daily and informs people on vaccination camps they can access, using a mega phone. Ela Amuthan is a B.Com graduate from the American College and was working as an LIC agent for many years. His social work started by helping people find blood donors through his contacts and then he started participating in the last rite ceremonies of inmates in old age homes and unclaimed bodies along with his friend V P Manikandan. When the first covid wave struck, he started helping people get groceries and other needs. “When I went to the crematorium with Manikandan during the second wave, I saw ambulances lining up and even bringing two bodies. This is when I decided to do something to prevent deaths due to covid,” he said. He does not own a vehicle and does door-to-door campaigns in his ward 81. As it became difficult to reach out to a larger audience, he bought a megaphone. “I cover all the 30 odd streets in my ward from 10am to 12 noon everyday and have been able to make nearly 300 people take their first doses since August 15,” he said. Basheer, a resident, said they got information from him on where vaccines were being given and also came to know only through his announcements that prior registration was not needed. While his aim is to make all the eligible people in his ward get vaccinated, Amuthan also travels to other parts of the city with his megaphone talking about the importance of the vaccine. “Making Madurai free of covid is my ultimate aim,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/on-a-mission-to-get-everyone-in-madurai-city-vaccinated/articleshow/86020909.cms||---

The cynosure of all eyes on Tuesday at the convocation event was Latha HN, a visually handicapped student who secured gold medal in MA Kannada. Madalambike TS, who secured 10 gold medals and four cash prizes, lost her father three years ago and is from a remote village and a poor family. She was supported by her sister, who is a teacher, to pursue higher education. Latha, who is blind by birth is a BA, and BEd graduate. She joined MA in Kannada two years ago. “Technology helped me a lot to learn the subjects. I was typing on a computer using the Nudi font. Now, I have launched my own YouTube channel Nudi Thorana where I post videos on preparing for competitive examinations. I have uploaded 12 videos already,” she said. A resident of Handithavalli village near Ravandur in Periyapatna taluk, Latha’s parents are daily wage workers. “My sister Jayashri, father Nagaraju, and mother Radha supported my studies. They never said no to anything I dreamed,” she said. “At the time of Covid-19 crisis, my friends and sister helped me in my studies. They sent recorded notes which helped me a lot,” she said. Madalambike TS, who secured 10 gold medals and four cash prizes is a resident of Tammadahalla in Chamarajanagar taluk. She studied at the UoM PG Centre, Chamarajanagar. “Since my childhood, I have dreamed of pursuing an MA in Kannada. Three years ago, my father passed away. He had wanted me to secure gold medals.

---||Mysuru||Encroachment clearance drive relaunched in Gobbali reserve forest area||Hassan: The foresters in Gobbali reserve forest area, Arkalgud taluk in Hassan relaunched the encroachment clearance drive, which had earlier run into trouble, on Tuesday. As many as 91 dalit families from Gangur village had been cultivating the land, which the forest department claimed is a forest area in April and started to clear the encroachment leading to tension. Now the forest staff have relaunched the drive which has come under scrutiny. The village, where the families are residing, adjoins Gobbali reserve forest area. The families have been cultivating the disputed land since 1994 when they were freed from bonded labour. In the first week of April, with the help of police department, the forest officers had conducted a clearance drive which included digging livestock proof trenches to plant trees. The villagers, however, didn’t allow the officers to plant trees and erected temporary huts in the area. After learning that the villagers had decided to cultivate the land again, the forest department made preparations to stop them. They decided to launch the clearance drive at 7am on Tuesday. The RFO had requested the taluk health officer to provide them an ambulance with health staff as a precautionary measure to counter any untoward incident. “Hundred policemen were deployed at the spot. After taluk administration’s intervention, its was decided to stop the drive for a week,” said Arkalgud RFO Arun Kumar. “The villagers are assured of alternate land. The process of identifying land is assigned to respective officers. The report will be submitted to DC,” said Arkalgud tahsildar Renukumar. “After they were freed from bonded labour, they were not provided any suitable agricultural land and livelihood facilities as per the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act. Upset with this, they decided to cultivate the adjacent forest land for livelihood. We have never had an officer seek ambulance and health staff at an agitation site. This means means they were expecting untoward incidents,” said CPI(M) district president Dharmesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/encroachment-clearance-drive-relaunched-in-gobbali-reserve-forest-area/articleshow/86016451.cms||---

The joint call to action comes from non-attainment cities (ones that do not meet the prescribed air quality standards set by the Union environment ministry) like Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur, Chandrapur and others, reeling under poor air quality. Bad air days are when the air quality index (AQI) — pollutant measuring indicator — rises beyond the safe limit. The online campaign (https://blueskies.jhatkaa.org/) was initiated on September 7 — International Day of Clean Air for Blue Skies. In its second year since its inception, the theme for 2021 is ‘Healthy Air, Healthy Planet’. Maharashtra has a total of 19 non-attainment/million plus cities under the National Clean Air Action Plan, highest for any state in the country. Bhagwan Kesbhat, founder of Mumbai-based Waatavaran Foundation and member of Maharashtra Clean Air Collective, said, “Citizen groups across all non-attainment cities will also meet their respective municipal commissioners and submit a letter demanding a health advisory on bad air days.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-citizens-civil-bodies-across-state-seek-bad-air-day-alert/articleshow/86023051.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar

FOCEA alleged that at least 44 professors from self-finance departments have been asked to resign by the college administration since 2019. Most recently, on September 3, seven professors were forced to resign. “The professors were forcibly threatened to leave their jobs without any compensation except for three months’ salary. All staff are in fear of their job security,” said P Manoharan, secretary, FOCEA. The federation demanded that the college administration immediately reinstate all those who were forced to resign. “When we first protested after professors were forced to resign after getting just one month’s salary additionally, the administration started paying three months’ salary. However, the situation cannot continue as it is demoralizing and causes unnecessary fear,” said Manoharan. Around 80 faculty and staff took part in the protest led by V Suresh Kumar, president, FOCEA and other officer-bearers from MUTA and TANTSAC. The protesters shouted slogans and carried banners. Since Monday, the protesters had started wearing badges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/protest-against-forced-resignation-of-professors-at-thiagarajar-college/articleshow/86020960.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Her village has become the first in the district to have all 585 beneficiaries vaccinated with the first dose. The zilla parishad’s health administration was facing major vaccine hesitancy among the villagers. Only 130 villagers took the vaccine in April and May but none in June. That is when the health authorities hit a roadblock. “There were misgivings among the beneficiaries about taking the shots. They simply refused to take the vaccine. It was at this juncture that I decided to step in,” she said. She then did something that is common during the election period. Visiting all homes for support. That she had taken her vaccine dose helped. Patil is now fully vaccinated. “We as politicians visit their homes during elections to garner votes. So it was our moral duty to knock on their doors and win over them to get vaccinated,” she said. Patil’s efforts started yielding results in July when another 154 beneficiaries took vaccine. The remaining 299 were vaccinated on August 14-15, when mega vaccination drives were held in the state. The police patil of the village, Mukta Gosavi, who used to accompany the sarpanch during her door-to-door visits, recalled the determination to get all the beneficiaries in the village vaccinated. Jalgaon district health officer Dr B T Jamadar applauded Patil’s efforts. “She even got herself vaccinated early to send a positive message to the beneficiaries that it is safe to take the vaccine,” said Jamadar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/woman-sarpanchs-effort-to-get-all-villagers-vaccinated-pays-off/articleshow/86018503.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

Earlier, Vadodara with 49 cases had the highest cases. With nine cases less on Tuesday, the number of active cases dropped to 40. The state has been experiencing spike in cases for the past two days. After 19 cases on Monday, 18 were recorded on Tuesday, much higher than the weekly average of 13. With discharge of 21 patients, the active cases got reduced by 3. The new cases on Tuesday included 7 from Ahmedabad city, 3 from Surat city, 2 each from Vadodara city, Kutch and Navsari districts, and 1 each from Gandhinagar city and Tapi.

---||Pune||Pune: Laboratories delaying data entry of negative Covid test reports to face action||PUNE: The district administration will initiate action against the laboratories faltering in uploading Covid-19 test reports on time, especially the data on negative and home test kits’ results. “The delay in data entry impacts the district’s weekly positivity rate (WPR) report prepared at the state-level. We have already told the laboratories not to delay the entries, especially the negative reports. The district collector, as the head of the district, can initiate action against these laboratories,” said a senior health official. Last week, there was differences in WPR data in the cabinet report and that generated by the district health officials. The district authorities had attributed it to the laboratories’ delay in entering the Covid negative test report data. The district health officials claimed that they would check the laboratories delaying the data entry from now on. The caseload was less now compared to April-May and so there should be no delay in data entry, said one among them. He said the district’s WPR — crucial for taking decisions on imposing or withdrawing curbs — hinged on the entry of Covid test reports. Explaining the issue, a public health official said the data was collated at three levels. There are two portals — CV Analytics (based on realtime data from laboratories) and that of Indian Council of Medical Research. Besides, each district maintains data at their own level. He said these three data hardly matched, prompting confusion. The health officials also expressed concern over the delay in feeding the home tests’ data correctly on the portal. They stressed that the use of home test kits was quite high, and it should be monitored if their data reflected on the portal. Last month, over 80,000 home test kits were used across Maharashtra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/laboratories-delaying-data-entry-of-negative-test-reports-to-face-action/articleshow/86020972.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Pune||Pune tops Maharashtra vaccination chart again with 1.8 lakh Covid shots||PUNE: The district topped the state with the highest singleday Covid-19 vaccination once again with 1.82 lakh beneficiaries getting their shots till 8pm on Tuesday, while Mumbai recorded the second-highest vaccination figures of 79,000 doses and 52,314 beneficiaries were administered vaccine in Ahmednagar. According to the health department authorities in Pune district, the final vaccination figure for Tuesday could cross two-lakh because many vaccination centres were updating their information online till late in the night. On August 31, the district had registered a record vaccination of 2.57 lakh beneficiaries. The vaccination figures till 8pm suggested that the Pune rural had crossed the onelakh vaccination mark. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits recorded 68,000 vaccinations and the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) areas registered 14,000 vaccinations. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Cantonment General hospital (SVPCGH) vaccinated around 692 beneficiaries in a short notice after getting the alert about the mega vaccination drive. Pune Zilla Parishad chief executive officer (CEO) Ayush Prasad said, “The involvement of local communities at the gram panchayat-level has proven quite helpful in rural areas. Our microplanning has made sure that all the eligible adults get their shots at the nearest vaccination site. For the semi-urban areas, we have tied up with housing societies to achieve maximum possible inoculation.” Prasad said efforts from the medical and paramedical staffers had also helped them keep the consistency in the inoculation drive. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, told TOI, “The district is again likely to get a bumper lot of doses, so the mega vaccination drive is likely to be continued for the next few days. We want to vaccinate as many citizens as we can before the festive season starts. The instructions are very clear, exhaust all the vaccine stock within a day or two.” (With inputs from Swati Shinde Gole)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pune-tops-state-vaccination-chart-again-with-1-8l-shots/articleshow/86020944.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Coimbatore||Principal of private school in Annur test positive for Covid||Coimbatore: The principal of a private school in Annur tested positive for Covid-19 on Tuesday. The principal had symptoms of Covid-19 and abstained from going to school since Monday. She has been admitted to a private hospital for treatment. The school was closed for classes from Tuesday noon onwards and parents have been informed that it would be reopened only after puja holidays. Meanwhile, the school education department has decided to step up the vaccination programme for parents of students from Class IX to Class XII. Officials said vaccination is the only way forward to safeguard the school-going children and continue operating schools. “Only about 40% of the parents of school-going children have received at least one dose of vaccine in the district so far,” said an official from the school education department. Health department officials said that most of the students tested positive for Covid-19 during a random check. Chances are high that students might have contracted the virus from their parents, they said. While asking the private schools to conduct vaccination camps for parents of students from their schools, chief education officer said headmasters of government schools have been tasked with contacting parents and insist that they should get vaccines. Though vaccination camps were conducted by both government and private schools in the days before the schools were reopened, a large section of parents still remain unvaccinated, she said. “A private school in Therkkupalayam recently conducted a vaccination camp for parents. While 300 doses of vaccine were available, only around 50 parents turned up. Still there is vaccine hesitancy among certain section of people,” she said. Deputy director of health services P Aruna said they are planning to test more students in the coming days to detect cases at the earliest in order to prevent the infection from spreading to other students and teachers.  “We have collected 1,500 samples from students after the schools were reopened. In the next phase, as many as 24 teams of health officials will collect 2,000 samples from students randomly,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/principal-of-private-school-in-annur-test-positive-for-covid/articleshow/86020952.cms||V Devanathan
---||Coimbatore||City records 53% rise in air passengers||Coimbatore: After a slump in the passenger traffic in May and June, when the second wave of Covid-19 was at its peak in the district, the city airport has bounced back to business by handling 99,000 passengers in August alone. This was a 53% increase in passenger traffic from July, when it handled 64,457 passengers. The airport had handled 96,529 domestic passengers and 2,291 international passengers last month, compared to 63,244 domestic passengers and 1,213 international passengers in July. The number of flights from the airport has also seen a sharp rise of 67% in August. However, the numbers, be they of passenger traffic or flights, are nowhere near the pre-Covid times. In August 2019, the airport had handled 2.32 lakh domestic passengers, 20,005 international travellers and 1,679 aircrafts. Aviation enthusiasts said they were happy to see the airport limping back to normalcy. It is to be noted that the domestic and international passenger traffic had touched a low of 23,555 and 829, respectively, in May. Travel agents said 40% of the domestic passengers had used the airport to fly to Chennai, while the remaining were headed to Mumbai, Bengaluru, New Delhi and Hyderabad. In a new trend, many guest workers too have started taking flights from the city to their native places and back. Ashish Kanted, proprietor of Ashish Travels, said presently the airport was mostly used by the business community, followed by the guest workers and leisure travellers. “Earlier, guest workers mainly used trains to commute to their hometowns and back. In the absence of trains, some of them are taking flights with the employer bearing a large chunk of the airfare. Leisure travel has also started picking up and the focus is on domestic places, as it isn’t easy to visit destinations abroad.” City airport director S Senthil Valavan said the people were more confident to fly now as the Airport Authority of India had put in place all the safety protocols. “All the airport employees have taken the first dose of vaccine and many of them are fully vaccinated. We have a swab collection facility for Covid-19 testing as well for the convenience of travellers. Those travelling to Gulf countries are finding it useful.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/city-records-53-rise-in-air-passengers/articleshow/86021018.cms||V Devanathan
---||Hyderabad||Telangana legislative council may have 50% vacancies by January||HYDERABAD: The legislative council, the upper House of the Telangana legislature, may have 50% members if elections are not held in time to the existing six vacancies and another 12 seats scheduled to fall vacant on January 5. The hot debate in political circles is whether polls would be held or delayed further due to a possible Covid-19 third wave, leaving the upper House nearly half-empty. Kalvakuntla Kavitha, daughter of chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, is among the MLCs whose term of office would end along with 12 MLCs. She is most likely to get a second term. Of the 40-member House, the six existing vacancies are under the MLAs’ quota and another 12 to fall vacant on January 5 are under the local authorities’ category. Though one more seat is vacant under the ‘nominated’ category, the cabinet has recommended the name of P Kaushik Reddy and the relevant file is pending with the governor. Constitutional experts have said there won’t be any impact on people or passage of bills even if 50% vacancy is created in the council as the ruling party has enough members to have its way with new laws and reforms, if any. However, it is the possibility of a Covid-19 third wave which has stirred up a hot discussion in political circles whether the aspirants have to wait longer than expected. Already, the elections to six MLC vacancies have been deferred once due to the pandemic. A notification for the by-poll to the Huzurabad assembly constituency too has been delayed due to coronavirus and other factors. Chief electoral officer Shashank Goel told TOI that they have not received any communication about holding polls to either the existing MLC seats or by-poll to the Huzurabad assembly constituency. Sources said the ECI would take a call on holding polls in Telangana after the festival season in November first week. Sources said at least two Dalit candidates are likely to make it to the council as promotion of Scheduled Castes is high on the agenda of the CM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/council-may-have-50-vacancies-by-jan/articleshow/86023040.cms||Roushan Ali

The court was hearing the bail petitions filed by S Jagatheeswaran of Madurai, R Nicholos and his son N Alangara Sakkratis of Tuticorin district. The case of the prosecution is that 23 Sri Lankans without any proper documents came to Tuticorin district on April 28. Subsequently, they reached Madurai district and were made to stay near the Kappalur industrial estate area with the help of Ashok Kumar and Kasiviswanathan. In the petition, Nicholos and Sakkratis stated that they were fishermen and were falsely implicated in this case. Similarly, Jagatheeswaran stated that he was working as the acting driver for Kasiviswanathan and was falsely implicated in this case. Since the state government sought time to get response, justice B Pugalendhi adjourned the case to a further date for hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/3-held-for-helping-23-lankans-enter-india-illegally-seek-bail/articleshow/86020989.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: 1.25 lakh ineligible ration cards given up||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: As many as 1,25,070 ration card holders in various categories have voluntarily surrendered their cards to the government till July 31, after the government urged them to surrender if they do not fall in various eligible categories. In order to weed out the remaining ineligible card holders, the civil supplies department has launched a WhatsApp number by which the public can inform any such information about ineligible card holders. Till July, out of the 5,85,977 Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) cards distributed in the state, 9,935 cards have been surrendered and brought under non-priority non-subsidy (NPNS) category, who are offered rice and wheat at regular, non-subsidised rates. Similarly, from the total 32,62,522 priority household (PHH) cards, 65,328 cards have been surrendered and from the non-priority subsidy (NPS) category, under which 25,01,646 cards have been distributed, 49,807 have been surrendered. These cards were surrendered from the 38,58,322 card holders in the state (3.24%). The purification of the database, especially of the AAY and PHH is the core activity of the department to weed out the ineligible from the system, civil supplies department sources said. Based on the instructions of civil supplies minister G R Anil, a meeting chaired by civil supplies commissioner D Sajith Babu on Monday set a target of November 1 to ensure that 100% of the eligible cardholders receive their share of ration. It has been found that last month, as many as 97% of the cardholders had received the rations. It is reliably learnt that those cardholders who have not accepted their eligible rations for three months June, July and August will be categorized as those who do not require rations. The rationing inspectors will assess such cardholders and if found that they are ineligible, they will be weeded out of the priority list. It is in addition to this that the department has also decided to launch a WhatsApp number (9495998223) in which the public can inform about any ineligible citizen holding the priority ration card. It has been instructed to take action in such cases within 24 hours, and report the compliance. The WhatsApp facility for complaint registration will be functional till October 15. The state had implemented the National Food Securities Act, 2013, on November 1, 2016. As per the Act, the state has 4,228 fair-price shops (authorized ration dealers ARD) with 90,86,816 card holders. The total number of beneficiaries under the system is 3,57,42,768 (as per the estimates, each card has 4.2 beneficiaries in the state). As many as 5,95,800 cards under the AAY are allowed in the state, of which the state has already distributed 5,85,977 cards. The remaining 9,823 cards can be distributed to 41,256 beneficiaries. Also, as per the NFSA, the total number of cards that can be distributed in the priority household category is 1,54,80,040.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/1-25l-ineligible-ration-cards-given-up/articleshow/86021061.cms||KP Saikiran
---||Delhi||No going back: Afghan Sikhs in Delhi take tentative steps towards rebuilding||NEW DELHI: Growing up in Kabul, Kulwinder Singh is not unused to the sound of gunshots being fired. August 15, however, was a different day. “I was at my grocery shop. At around 9.30am, there were sounds of gunshots being fired. No one was sure what was happening, but soon enough there was panic and chaos in the market,” said the 40-year-old. The Taliban had swept into Afghanistan’s capital. “I closed my shop and shifted my family to a gurdwara near our home for safety,” said Singh, sitting with his wife, Kuljeet Kaur, in a room adjacent to Guru Arjan Dev Ji Gurdwara in New Mahavir Nagar in west Delhi. The Singh couple and their four children were among the 78 Afghan evacuees who were airlifted from Afghanistan on August 24 and put in Covid quarantine at the Indo-Tibetan Border Police Centre at Chhawla. They were released from the quarantine centre on Tuesday. “The situation in Afghanistan is very tense. We left our homes and shops there and almost fled our country in whatever we were wearing,” said Himmat Singh, 45, of Ghazni with folded palms. “Thankfully, we managed to bring Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji with us and we are thankful to the Indian government for helping us.” Himmat said living in Afghanistan had never been completely safe and the situation had only worsened with the Taliban taking control. “I was abducted 30 years ago, along with some others in my neighbourhood. Now the streets are completely deserted,” he said, admitting that he hadn’t faced problems reaching the airport despite the proliferation of armed Taliban fighters in the streets. Himmat used to sell medicinal plants and herbs and doesn’t know what India holds for his future. “At the moment, I am just thankful that my family has reached India safely. I haven’t begun thinking about my next step yet,” he said. “All I know is there is no going back,” he said. A tired but hopeful Kailash Kaur is more hopeful of building her life anew. Having lost her youngest son, just 21 years old, in a bomb blast in Kabul a few months ago, she now worries for the two sons stranded in Afghanistan. She holds on to the hope that they will be able to reach India after international flights resume from Kabul. Soon after they were allowed to leave the quarantine centre, Kaur and 43 other Afghan Sikhs and Hindu were brought by voluntary organisations to the New Mahavir Nagar gurdwara. However, by evening most families, including Kaur’s, had chosen to move in with relatives in Delhi or in Punjab. Before leaving for Ludhiana where her two married daughters live, Kaur shared that she had brought her grandchildren, her slain son’s children, to India. “Now, even as I am safe, I worry about my two sons and daughter-in-law who are living in a gurdwara in Kabul. They don’t sleep all night and are surviving on the langar served there,” Kaur said. She claimed that she was evacuated with just two pairs of clothes and nothing else. Manmeet Kaur, 35, said that it was never very safe for women to venture out on the streets of Kabul and she seldom stepped out of the house since last year. “The education of our children has been badly affected for more than a year,” she added. Vikramjit Singh Sahney, international president, World Punjabi Organisation, and chairman, Sun Foundation, revealed having helped bring Afghan Sikh and Hindu families in three chartered flights last year. Sahney is also arranging for the reskilling of the refugees. “We want them to learn beauty and wellness, stitching, IT-enabled services and tasks like electricians,” he said. Kanv Bhalla, rehabilitation head, Sobti Foundation, described how the body was arranging rented accommodations and basic monthly financial support for the displaced Afghans. “Financial support helps a lot, but the need of the hour is creating livelihood options for them,” Bhalla said. “In the past, most of them took up odd jobs. This time, we want to see if we can link them to small self-sustaining businesses.” Watch Afghan Sikh refugees in Delhi get ready to move forward towards rebuilding||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-going-back-afghan-sikhs-take-tentative-steps-towards-rebuilding/articleshow/86021131.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The residents are descendants of a group of conservancy workers, who were brought by the British officials to work for Coimbatore municipality, and residing in the houses belonging to the city corporation. While the younger generation is mainly into other jobs, a few of them still work with the civic body, the residents said. P Lakshmi, 65, a retired conservancy worker, said she had no option but to fetch water from the public tap. “Because of the rush, residents often quarrel with one another while collecting the water. We have electricity connection, salt water connection and underground drainage connection, which are in the name of corporation commissioner. But the drinking water connection is still eluding us.” Recalling that he had shifted to a house in the colony when he was aged six years, N Dhanraj, 72, president of the residents’ association, said his parents were conservancy workers with the civic body and they had done manual scavenging works in those days. “When we approached for a piped drinking water connection, officials asked for property tax documents and land documents, which we do not have since the land belongs to the city corporation. We want the civic body to provide us piped drinking water connection,” he said. P Murugesan, another resident, said they had moved the Madras high court and obtained orders to get the land in their names after paying the guideline value some 15 years ago. “But the order was not yet complied with.” A corporation official said the houses should have been vacated by the occupants after their retirement from the service, but the same was not done. “We cannot provide water connection without the required documents. Only the government can take policy decisions in this regard. While they say they have received a court order to get the land transferred to their names, they haven’t yet produced the same before us.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/cmc-colony-folk-seek-piped-drinking-water-connection/articleshow/86020994.cms||V Devanathan

Panacea Biotec has announced supply of the first shipment, out of 1 million doses, of the second dose component of Sputnik V for sale in India that will be distributed by Russian Direct Investment Fund’s (RDIF) Indian partner Dr Reddy’s Labs. “This is the first batch of the second component produced at our facility in Himachal Pradesh and supplied in India. The company received necessary clearance from Central Drug Laboratories (CDL), Kasauli, on August 31,” Panacea Biotec said. With this, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, which had been struggling to ramp up supplies to private hospitals due to non-availability of the second dose, on Tuesday said it has begun ramping up vaccine availability nationwide. “Dr Reddy’s has initiated supply of the first dose component to partner hospitals all over India followed by equivalent doses of the second dose component. With more batches of the second dose component to follow from the manufacturing site we expect this momentum and supply to continue,” a Dr Reddy’s spokesperson told TOI. The rollout comes over four months after Sputnik V received EUA in mid-April. Dr Reddy’s had announced mid-June as deadline for commercial rollout but failed to do so as it received only 4.5 lakh doses of the second dose and 31.5 lakh doses of first dose component (Ad26) from Russia. The two doses have to be administered 21 days apart.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sputnik-v-commercial-rollout-begins/articleshow/86023038.cms||Swati Bharadwaj
---||Pune||High monsoon humidity linked to Covid rise in Pune, Mumbai, Delhi: IITM study||PUNE: Researchers from the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) have linked high humidity during the monsoon to the increase in daily Covid cases in at least three cities — Pune, Delhi and Mumbai. The findings were published in the international journal, Earth Systems and Environment, recently. Virus particles get a medium like the water vapour droplets in high humidity conditions to stay suspended in the air for a longer time. Drier air helps high evaporation rates of saliva contaminated droplets. The research examined the impact of meteorological parameters during the summer and monsoon seasons from April to September 2020 on daily Covid cases in Pune, Delhi, Mumbai and Ahmedabad, each with a distinct climate and geography. Researchers noted that humidity levels were strongly correlated with Covid infections in Pune which is surrounded by hills, dry Delhi and coastal Mumbai, but no such correlation was found in arid Ahmedabad. In Pune, the positive correlation was .70, in Delhi it was .50 and in Mumbai .46, but no such correlation was found in Ahmedabad. No connection was found between Covid cases and daily temperatures in any of these cities. Humidity spiked during the monsoon as rainfall was high in Delhi and Pune last year. Ahmedabad recorded relatively less than average rainfall last year, hence there was no correlation. Hence, the virus spread fast in Pune and Delhi. But, in Mumbai, which remains highly humid throughout the year, the positive correlation between humidity and Covid spread was not as much as Pune and Delhi, IITM officials said. Scientists said the virus travels with respiratory droplets, hence the association of Covid cases with relative/absolute humidity in dry regions such as Pune and Delhi could have serious implications. Gufran Beig, senior scientist and founder project director of System of Air Quality Forecasting and Research at Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, told TOI, “Using sophisticated statistical models to analyse linkages between various meteorological variables and the daily Covid cases from April to September 2020, the study found that the virus appears to be insensitive to most weather parameters except humidity, whose association with Covid varies with different climatic zones.” Beig said low summer humidity in arid, dry regions showed negligible effect on Covid cases. “However, they surged in tandem with humidity levels in Mumbai where humidity was high. During high humidity conditions like in the monsoon, Pune and Delhi, which are otherwise dry regions, also showed a surge in infections,” he said. Low humidity levels in summer in drier Delhi and Pune did not seem to have an impact on infection spread.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/high-monsoon-humidity-linked-to-covid-rise-in-pune-mumbai-delhi-iitm-study/articleshow/86021041.cms||Neha Madaan

Advocate General (AG) SN Babulkar appeared before the bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma to point out that the livelihoods of local residents living around the shrines have been affected and therefore, the stay should be vacated. The bench however said that a special leave petition (SLP) is already before the Supreme Court (SC) and it cannot pass any order until the SLP is pending. Sources in the state government now say that the SLP will be withdrawn from the apex court and a fresh application will be filed before the HC to allow the Yatra. As reported by TOI earlier, the HC had on June 28 stayed the cabinet decision of June 25 that allowed locals of Rudraprayag, Chamoli and Uttarkashi districts to visit Char Dham shrines located in their respective districts. The court had concluded that reopening of the yatra would lead to “inviting a calamity” and therefore the stay is in public interest and in interest of justice. The state government then moved the SC seeking a stay on the HC’s directions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/state-appeals-hc-to-lift-stay-on-char-dham-yatra/articleshow/86018565.cms||Prashant Jha

On arrival, airport authorities have to ensure that all passengers undergo another RT-PCR test. All international travellers are now required to undergo RT-PCR test before departure and after arrival. But state health department officials reiterated the need to follow the SOPs stringently to keep the Mu variant, which may not be covered by the vaccines, at bay. Bangladesh is among the seven countries on the watchlist for the variant. At a meeting held in Swastha Bhawan, state officials urged airport authorities to be extra cautious about passengers coming from Bangladesh, South Africa, China, Botswana, Mauritius, New Zealand and Zimbabwe where Mu variant has been detected. As per the guideline, mandatory pre- and post-RT-PCR tests have been sought for international passengers from these seven countries in addition to the already existing norms for travellers through flights originating from the UK, Europe and West Asia. At present, Kolkata has direct connectivity with only Bangladesh and the UK and the Gulf. “All incoming passengers from Bangladesh, UK and West Asia are being tested at the Kolkata airport’s Covid testing lab and are being allowed to leave the airport premises only on receipt of a Covid negative certificate,” said Kolkata airport director C Pattabhi. “The test is a paid service available at the airport. If any passenger insists on a free service, he or she can be sent to CNCI for testing. In case someone tests positive, the passenger will be admitted to ID&BG,” said a senior state health department official. At the meeting, airport officials also brought up the issue of the 13-month-long-five-city (Mumbai, Pune, Chennai, Nagpur, Ahmedabad) partial ban but no decision of resumption of normal flight movement in these sectors were taken yet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/double-check-on-intl-flyers-to-keep-mu-variant-at-bay/articleshow/86018605.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

The activists — Baba Indulkar and Dilip Desai — claimed that recently Wadettiwar made strong remarks against the Maratha community. “The minister, through an open platform, said he will hit the street with stick in hand if the Marathas are given reservation through the Other Backward Class (OBC) quota,” Desai said. The activists belong to the faction of Maratha community who want reservation through the OBC quota. “The ministers take oath assuring they will not cause enmity among groups or favour any one group. Wadettiwar used language of violence which is against the oath. The governor has powers to strip him from the position as per the Constitution of India.

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: 500 nominated posts to be filled soon, says KT Rama Rao||HYDERABAD: In what could cheer TRS leaders, party working president KT Rama Rao said 500 nominated posts will be filled soon. He said co-option member posts in Greater Hyderabad would be filled at the earliest. Assuring that every TRS leader and worker would be recognised, KTR said those who strove hard for strengthening the party would be rewarded suitably. He said training programmes would be conducted for party workers and leaders after Dasara, mainly to enlighten them on taking government schemes to the people. Taking a dig at Congress and BJP at the TRS Greater Hyderabad committee meeting on Tuesday ahead of the party organisational elections, KTR said: “Though they claim themselves to be national parties, they resort to ‘galli’ (street) and silly politics.” He called upon the party leaders to hit back strongly when these parties make unnecessary allegations either on the TRS or party chief K Chandrasekhar Rao. KTR said the opposition parties were making allegations on the TRS government for electoral gains and for ‘newspaper headlines’. He reiterated that Huzurabad by-election was a small election and that the ruling party had won all the elections in the past seven years. When KCR started Telangana movement two decades ago, he was all alone. He made Congress speak in favour of Telangana statehood in 2004 and TDP in 2009. “Though the Congress government tried to suppress the movement, KCR’s relentless fight forced Congress to grant separate statehood for Telangana,” KTR said. On the organisational elections in Greater Hyderabad, he asked the party leaders to constitute 6,300 committees in 150 divisions, including 4,800 colonies and 1,486 notified slums before September 20. There would be social media committees in all municipal divisions in the city, he said.

---||Kolkata||Repair hope for Lightning Sculptor’s Kumartuli studio||Kolkata: The studio of Kumartuli’s “lightning sculptor” Gopeswar Paul, who was the first to break away from the “ekchala” pattern, might finally get repaired. Long back, it was declared a Grade 1 heritage building and also finds a mention on the KMC list. Multiple appeals by Paul’s descendants to KMC seeking its intervention for repairs have met with no response. At a West Bengal Heritage Commission meeting held on Monday, it was decided that an engineer will visit the studio soon to inspect how and when the repair work can begin. WBHC’s secretary Umapada Chatterjee and officer on special duty Basudeb Mallik had paid a visit to the studio on August 31. WBHC chairperson Suvaprasanna said: “We plan to install a blue plaque outside the studio located on 40A Kashi Mitra Ghat Street. We will see to it that the sculptures are displayed properly inside without changing the original aesthetics of the space. Our architect will visit the studio soon to inspect how the repair work can start.” Paul’s descendant Abhijit, who has studied at the Government College of Art and Craft, is keen about the repairs. Gopeswar was born in 1893 and died in 1944. In 1924, Gopeswar had floored everyone with his work at the British Empire exhibition in the Wembley. He had gone to Italy to visit the studios of famous sculptors before starting to make idols in Kumartuli. “He took a small space on rent near Kashi Mitra ghat. That was initially used as a storehouse for cots meant for taking the dead to the crematorium. He built a shade in front to start his workshop,” he added. Gopeswar Paul's studioLater, his son Siddheswar bought that space to build a studio and workshop for G Paul and Sons. Many stories about Gopeswar’s aesthetics and lightning speed have become part of Kolkata’s oral history. One anecdote involves Netaji, who was then the chairman of the ‘Kumartuli Sarbojonin Durga Puja’. Just a day before the Pujas, the idol caught fire. Overnight, Gopeswar had single-handedly sculpted all the five idols. His idols were clad in Benarasi saris and were given crowns. To get the correct proportions of the lion’s idol, Gopeswar would visit the Alipore zoo and sculpt miniature figures. These would serve as models for his lifesize sculptures. Using a towel for the skin of the lion and coconut coil for the mane were his innovations. The Italian marble idols of Ramakrishna at Belur and RN Mookherjee’s idol at Victoria were sculpted by him. Abhijit’s aunt Jamuna is the sculptor’s daughter-in-law. His father Byomkesh Paul manages the studio now. “On Tuesday, I submitted the letters my aunt wrote to KMC regarding the repair of the studio,” Abhijit said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/repair-hope-for-lightning-sculptors-kumartuli-studio/articleshow/86018612.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta

While the administrative approval for the construction of the building was sanctioned by the state government in January 2020, the construction was halted in May 2020 as the government decided to put curbs on expenses and focus more on Covid management. “We have floated the tender for the construction of the building and over next 45 days, bidders are expected to file their bids. Once the due procedure is over and the state government finalises the contractor, the work order will be issued,” said Prashant Sonawane, the superintendent engineer of Nashik PWD. According to another senior PWD officer, the state government, that had frozen developmental activities in May 2020, has now started releasing funds for the developmental works again. “The funds are being provided in a step-by-manner,” the officer added. The eco-friendly green building will have various features including a rainwater harvesting system, roof-top solar power system, bio-digesters to treat sewage etc. The 34,093.7 sqm building will be constructed on 2.5 hectare of land behind the existing court building. In all, the building will house 45 courts against the 34 courts currently functioning on the premises. The current building faces a shortage of at least 44 rooms to accommodate the courts and other offices. The new building will have a court of the principal district judge, 21 senior division courts, 18 district judge courts, one child-friendly court, and three Pocso courts. The building will also have waiting rooms, canteens, and video conference halls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/bids-invited-for-rs-171cr-nashik-court-building/articleshow/86018608.cms||Abhilash Botekar

All administrative heads of 79 hospitals have been asked to submit its site proposal and plan by September 12. “We need to make these hybrid critical care units functional within a short period to combat the probable surge in number of Covid-19 infected patients. The attempt will be to get these ready by October beginning,” said a senior health department official. Each of the hybrid CCUs will consist 8 critical care beds and 16 HDU beds. The 79 hospitals include medical colleges in Diamond Harbour and Bankura, while the rest are mostly district, sub-divisional and superspecialty hospitals. Unlike the first wave when Covid-19 did not pose a great threat in most districts, the second wave had the virus creating havoc in rural Bengal. The units will be set up in an estimated space of at least 3,500 square feet. Negative air pressure in the patient care area and centralised medical oxygen supply system are among the criterion for these CCUs. Hospitals have been asked to utilise general wards in case additional space is required.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/critical-care-units-in-79-govt-hosps/articleshow/86018610.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

---||Kolkata||On duty here, Af docs worry for families back home||Kolkata: They came to Bengal to pursue their medical education, hoping that they would go back to serve their country after obtaining higher education. But the turn of events in Afghanistan has left three young doctors sleepless as they worry about their families stuck in the trouble-torn country. The three families live in different provinces. “I am extremely worried for the safety of my family in Kabul. The anxiety often keeps me awake at night. Though I have been talking to them every day, I am scared for their safety,” said Fazal Zafar, one of the doctors. Right after completing their MBBS courses in Afghanitan, Zafar, Mohammad Navi and Ismat Alizai came to Mission Hospital in Durgapur for a three-year fellowship programme on emergency medicine. Like other doctors in the hospital, the trio had been part of the hospital’s Covid workforce during the peak of the pandemic. In fact, Zafar had contracted the virus in January this year. He visited his family in March for a month when all was well. Since his house is barely 7km from the Kabul airport, the scenes in and around the airport have disturbed him deeply. “My parents struggled hard for the education of their children. Even my younger brother is pursuing MBBS course. I wanted to go back and serve my people. But now our future has become so uncertain,” said Zafar. Even after completing his three-year stint, Ismat Alizai got his visa extended so that he could garner more experience by working at the Durgapur hospital. His wife and five-year old son were planning to visit him in Durgapur. But the Taliban takeover has turned everything topsy-turvy. “Neither they can come here nor can I visit them now. They know that I am stressed and they keep assuring me that all is fine. But I know all is not well,” said Ismat. “We are thankful to colleagues in this hospital and especially Satyajit Bose and Debashish Ghosh for their support,” said Zafar. “All three are extremely gentle, sincere and hardworking. We will try to do everything to help them out,” said cardiac surgeon Bose, chairman of Mission Hospital, Durgapur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/on-duty-here-af-docs-worry-for-families-back-home/articleshow/86018619.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The superintendent of police, Dhule district, Chinmay Pandit told TOI that the three youngsters were nabbed after they robbed a resident of Darne village in Shindkheda taluka of his new bike and assaulted him resulting in his death on Monday afternoon. The victim Premsinh Girase was on his way back home after buying the new motorcycle. The suspects brandished sharp weapons and stole Girase’s bike, mobile phone and some cash. Initially, the victim was taken to the local hospital at Shindkheda and later he succumbed while being shifted to a hospital in Dhule city. “Since the incident took place in broad daylight, some onlookers saw the trio fleeing and one eyewitness told the police that one of the suspects had a tattoo on his hand,” said Pandit. Six police teams fanned out to the village adjoining Darne, where the victim lived. Based on the lead about the tattoo, the location of all three suspects was determined and they were nabbed. “We had the CCTV footage of the trio from a petrol pump as they had gone there to re-fuel their own bike before targeting the victim. We also crosschecked the footage with those arrested. The information about the tattoo gave us a vital clue to be able to nab the suspects,” added Pandit. After the incident, a group of local residents blocked the road demanding immediate arrest of the suspects. Pandit reached the spot and assured the agitators that the suspects would be arrested as soon as possible. “When the incident took place, we were in a meeting with the new deputy inspector general of Nashik range BG Shekhar and the officers in-charge of all police stations in the district were present at this meeting. During the course of the meeting, we were informed of the incident and we immediately swung into action,” said Pandit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/tattoo-helps-arrest-suspect/articleshow/86016565.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

---||Kolkata||Desi version of Cov treatment drug to hit markets by Sept-end||Kolkata: The Indian version of tocilizumab — the much-sought after drug for Covid treatment — could be out in the market by September-end. The news of this indigenous drug getting emergency use authorisation (EUA) has brought cheers and hope to the team of investigators who were part of the drug’s clinical trial in June. The second wave had seen a surge in demand for Swiss-made tocilizumab, primarily used for treatment of arthritis, for treating severely infected Covid-19 patients. With the drug short in supply, there had been cases of hoarding and black-marketing. With the indigenously developed Indian version of the drug — tocira by Hetero Pharma — likely to be rolled out in a few weeks, it is expected to strengthen the supply chain. The price is expected to cheaper as well. “This is an important milestone in the war against Covid-19. We are extremely happy and proud to have been part of the study on the efficacy on this drug. We are thankful to organisations like Hetero for the effort to develop such generic, low-cost drug,” said Subhrojyoti Bhowmick, clinical and academics director at Peerless Hospital. Peerless was one among 10 medical institutes across the country where the drug underwent ‘therapeutic equivalent trial’ where Bhowmick co-investigated the study. Ajoy Sarkar, clinical director (critical care unit), was the principal investigator. During the trial, tocira was pitted against Roche’s tocilizumab to find if the Indian version matched up to the efficacy of the imported drug. A section of volunteer patients were administered the Swiss-made drug while another set of patients got Hetero Pharma’s tocira. The outcome of the two drugs was compared at the end of the trial. Investigators said the Indian version was extremely comparative both in terms of efficacy and safety. Findings from the study from 10 sites were collated and data was submitted to DCGI before it got the EUA. “The drug will be manufactured in Hyderabad at its dedicated Biologics facility of Hetero Biopharma Ltd (subsidiary/group company of Hetero Labs Ltd) and marketed by its associate company, Hetero Healthcare Ltd,” said Shubhodeep Sinha, senior vice-president and medical director of Hetero Group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/desi-version-of-cov-treatment-drug-to-hit-markets-by-sept-end/articleshow/86018624.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Chavan, considered the architect of modern Maharashtra, was born in a four-room house in the Devrashtre village of Sangli district in 1913. He was involved in the freedom movement and had later joined politics. He became the first CM of Maharashtra and even served as Deputy Prime Minister of India. His house has been given the status of a state-protected monument. While many other places, such as the school in the village where Chavan studied, have been developed, the memorial at his birthplace is yet to take shape. The process has been going on for the past 12 years and funds of Rs 2.17 crore continue to remain unutilised with the archeology department. Recently, Sangli collector Abhijeet Chaudhary visited the village and met the people living in the neighbourhood — in all, 11 families. He assured them of decent compensation for their land (roughly 11 guntas) and rehabilitation. “I found that the people had no problem with the compensation. However, they are being held back due to emotional considerations. Many residents said that they were born here and want to continue living here. Some of them have shops. I assured them that the shops can be incorporated into the design of the birthplace memorial and they will thus not lose their businesses,” Chaudhary said. Chavan’s house was in shambles a few years ago. The state archeology department carried out some repairs. The department has now put up photographs at the venue and showcases a film on Chavan’s journey for the visitors. The memorial work will include strengthening the house, landscaping so that visitors can spend some quality time here. Chaudhary said the minutes of the discussion with the neighbours are prepared and soon he will submit the report to the government. The panel appointed to monitor the memorial works include the Yashwantrao Chavan Pratishthan. NCP chief Sharad Pawar is the chairman of the pratishthan. The locals who want the memorial have appealed to Pawar to help resolve the matter.

---||Kozhikode||No provocative lectures or statements: CUK to faculty||Kozhikode: Central University of Kerala (CUK) in Kasaragod issued a circular on Aug 30, asking its faculty members and employees not to give provocative lectures or statements that are ‘anti-national and go against the interest of the nation’. The circular issued by the registrar (in charge) also warned that disciplinary action will be taken against those who indulge in such activities in future. It is learnt that the circular was issued after the recent row over CUK suspending an assistant professor in the department of international relations and politics for reportedly calling RSS a ‘proto-fascist organization’ while taking an online class on ‘Fascism and Nazism’ in April. The suspension of Gilbert Sebastian by vice-chancellor H Venkateshwarlu, pending inquiry, in May was revoked the next month after issuance of a strict, warning letter to the teacher. The latest circular was issued as per the decision taken on June 24 at the 51st meeting of the executive council of the university; the issue involving Gilbert Sebastian was discussed then. The council, which observed that Sebastian’s statement in class was ‘anti-national’, had ‘authorized the vice-chancellor to issue a circular in the University that, in future faculty or employees should abstain from giving such provoking lectures/statements that in turn will affect the interest of the nation’. As per the minutes of the meeting, the members – while appreciating the action by the VC to suspend the faculty member–expressed their concern over the alleged, unilateral decision of the VC to revoke the suspension based on Sebastian’s regret and withdrawal letter. The disciplinary action against him was taken following complaints lodged by ABVP, the student outfit of BJP. Meanwhile, many faculty members expressed concern over the circular saying that it could be used to curtail freedom of speech and academic freedom and would make it difficult for teachers to engage in open discussions in classrooms. The order could be misused as it has not defined what constitutes ‘anti-national’, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/no-provocative-lectures-or-statements-cuk-to-faculty/articleshow/86021111.cms||---

After receiving drizzles through the day, many parts of Aurangabad reported heavy rain late on Tuesday evening, which resulted in waterlogging and power outage in some areas. Incessant showers led to the inundation of many localities in Mukhed, Loha and Kandhar talukas in Nanded district. Farms were left flooded and road connectivity was snapped in some places. The Godavari river that passes through Nanded and other areas was flowing at the level of 350 metres within the municipal limits of Nanded-Waghala by Tuesday evening, just one-metre short of the alert mark. The danger level is 354 metres. Earlier, a car carrying three people, including two close relatives of Mukhed MLA Tushar Rathod, was swept away in an overflowing nullah near Mukhed on Tuesday afternoon. While the driver exited the vehicle and climbed up a tree, Rathod’s cousin Bhagwan (65) and his son Sandeep (38) were feared drowned. Mukhed tehsildar Kashinath Patil said the search operation for both men was on till evening. Nanded collector Vipin Itankar said people living on the banks of the Godavari and its tributaries and nullahs have been asked to remain on alert. “The entire government machinery has been deployed in Mukhed, Loha and Kandhar as well as the Nanded municipal limits. People stranded due to the flood waters were rescued in separate operations,” he said. Road traffic on the Narsi-Degloor and Narsi-Biloli routes were disrupted due to submerging of bridges, causing heavy traffic jams. In Beed district, parts of Kaij and Georai taluka witnessed floods in a few areas as the tributaries of the Godavari started overflowing due to heavy rains. Bindusara dam situated near Beed was overflowing by Tuesday morning, causing some old bridges in the city to go under water. While spells of light to medium showers with occasional heavy showers were reported in many parts of the region till Tuesday evening, the possibility of more showers has prompted the district administration to sound an alert. Earlier, 28 revenue circles from Nanded district, 20 from Hingoli district and two from Parbhani district reported heavy showers of more than 65mm, official data shows. As per the data, Marathwada has reported a total of 12 rain-related deaths since the start of the current month, besides 664 cattle being killed in different parts of the region.

A moveable windrow compost system will be introduced on the premises of the solid waste treatment plant at Brahmapuram. Before setting up the unit, a group of councillors would visit a similar unit functioning in Hyderabad to study about it. The treatment of waste at the current plant is not effective. The state pollution control board (SPCB) has already pointed out the flaws at the existing windrow compost plant. The old building which houses the existing solid waste treatment plant is in a dilapidated condition. “We are planning to construct a new building in place of the existing plant. Then, we will be exploring the possibilities of introducing a new method of moveable windrow compost plant,” mayor M Anil Kumar said. “As a preliminary step, a team of councillors would visit a similar plant in Hyderabad. On the basis of the report by the councillors, we will be able to proceed,” Kumar said. Esteem developers will be implementing the project in Kochi. The moveable windrow compost system will be more effective. The machine can move around the plant premises and treat the waste. Mayor has given instructions to officials to complete the procedures for constructing the new plant before the onset of next monsoon. Though the state government is mooting a waste-to-energy (WTE) plant for treating the garbage in the city, the project has been pending for several years. The work on WTE plant couldn’t be started so far. Even if the work is started, it would take years for the completion of the plant. Until then, waste can be treated at the windrow compost plant. Measures for preparing a master plan for Brahmapuram are also progressing. The corporation has around 115 acres of land at Brahmapuram. Of this, the government had decided to allot 22 acres for setting up WTE plant. Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation (KSIDC) is the nodal officer for the WTE project. Now, the corporation is planning to ask the state government to take over the 22 acres where the proposed plant is to come up. Similarly, there is a septage treatment plant operating from the solid waste treatment plant premises. The government has also allotted five acres to IMAGE, a medical waste treatment wing of IMA, for constructing a medical waste treatment plant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/corp-mulls-moveable-waste-handling-unit-at-brahmapuram/articleshow/86018751.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

Patil told TOI that the IT sector is saturated in the big cities and many tech firms are looking for a better model to boost their output, while simultaneously ensuring that their employees get good working conditions away from the cluttered cities. He said added that the IT sector was the first to adopt the work-from-home culture after the Covid pandemic broke out and time has come to make employees from the smaller towns feel at home by developing nodal centres there. Patil said: “I have asked the business agencies, such Nasscom, to study and prepare the databases of the smaller cities across Maharashtra where we can set up government-run, well-equipped IT nodal centres. The idea is to have a set-up that allows the IT employees to work from near the native places. The companies can sign up to use the infrastructure for their employees. This way, the companies can retain the employees.” Patil has appealed to IT experts and enthusiasts to come up with suggestions to make tier-II and tier-III cities the IT hubs. He said the smaller cities will be given incentives to develop the IT habitat. A policy will be prepared regarding this as soon as the suggestions come in and surveys by agencies are done, said Patil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/satej-patil-it-nodal-centres-to-come-up-in-smaller-cities-in-maha/articleshow/86016668.cms||---
---||Delhi||No Afghan protesters outside UNHCR office now: Police||New Delhi: Delhi Police on Tuesday informed the Delhi high court that there are now no Afghan nationals protesting outside the UNHCR office in south Delhi. “The protest by Afghan refugees has been withdrawn from the UNHCR office,” the police informed the court in response to a petition filed by Vasant Vihar Welfare Association seeking the removal of protesters in the proximity of residential areas. The counsel, appearing for the association, also told Justice Rekha Palli that there is no protest in the area now. Taking note of the “change in circumstances,” the high court ended proceedings initiated by the association, but refused to pass any order in relation to the formulation of a policy on “congregation of foreign nationals/asylum seekers/refugees” as sought by the petitioner. The association submitted that “Last time also, there was a Rohingya crisis and people started gathering. This has become a routine now for people to gather and protest.” On September 3, the high court had directed the Delhi government and police to ensure that the number of Afghan nationals who were protesting outside the UNHCR office and seeking refugee status, was reduced and they strictly followed Covid-19-appropriate protocol. It had said that the law was same for everybody and questioned the authorities as to how there could be 500 persons gathered for the protest. The welfare association stated that many foreign nationals had gathered outside the office of United Nations High Commissioner of Refugees (UNHCR) in Vasant Vihar since August 15, and residents of nearby areas were facing difficulties due to this. It said that the number of such foreign nationals from Afghanistan had increased manifold in the past week owing to the takeover of the country by Taliban forces. According to the petition, the area has turned into a protest site where people from all age-groups, including children, are congregating despite the threat of the third wave of Covid-19 looming large. When the Centre’s counsel, while referring to the Afghanistan political crisis, had said the situation was not normal and it was unprecedented, the court said there was no question of being unreasonably harsh to anybody but the law was same for everybody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-afghan-protesters-outside-unhcr-office-now-police/articleshow/86021191.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The limb is popularly known as Jaipur Foot across the globe. The ex-president of Afghanistan, Ashraf Ghani had signed an MoU with the Jaipur Foot to hold camps in three provinces in his country. So far, six special camps in Afghanistan have been held and over 3,738 persons have benefited.In July, a delegation from the Afghanistan government headed by its ambassador to India, Farid Manmundzay visited Jaipur Foot to renew the agreement of holding the camp. The delegation asked them to hold a camp in Kabul in different cities and assured them of safety and security. The camp didn’t materialise because by then Taliban had begun to take over the entire country.Founder and chief patron of BMVSS, DR Mehta, says, “It is unfortunate that recent events in Afghanistan have jeopardised our plans to go there and help people.”Mehta told TOI that they wanted to set up a permanent camp in Afghanistan. “The talks of setting up permanent camp were at an advanced level but due to the uncertainty this came to a standstill,” Mehta added. In 2015, BMVSS sent 1,000 artificial limbs and trained health care members of the disability ministry of Afghanistan.The war there has taken a toll on hundreds of citizens who have lost their limbs and Jaipur Foot was their hope to a better future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jaipur-foot-teams-plan-for-camp-in-af-on-hold-after-taliban-moves-in/articleshow/86021183.cms||Shoeb Khan

Their primary demands are waiver of the loans taken from micro-finance companies (MFCs) and directions to the MFC operators to not harass women to recover the loans. These women had marched for a similar demand and few of them had even jumped into the Panchaganga waters after the 2019 floods as well. On Tuesday, the delegation met collector Rahul Rekhawar, who assured them that their demands would be taken up. Divya Magdum, the president of Chhatrapati Shashan Mahila Aghadi, who led the march, said: “The women had borrowed small amounts to run the self-help groups and earn some profit. However, since the 2019 floods, most of them have faced hard times. The pandemic further shut the markets in cities and towns where these women sold their products. They are now unable to pay the borrowed amounts. However, time, they are being forced by the agents to repay the installments.

Both the times Sharma with his team of experts in implanting artificial limbs had to escape amid gunshots and bombings. Recalling the harrowing time, Sharma says that they had arrived in the third biggest city of Afghanistan, Mazar-E-Sharif for an implant camp a couple of days ago.The city was surrounded by hills and the city belonged to those who had control of the hills. “Since we were under tight security in a secluded area, the advancing Taliban was not known to us until they reached the hills. I remember receiving a call from the Indian high commission office late in the night to be alert and be ready with our belongings. That moment I realised that we are under trouble,” said Sharma.By late morning, they could hear the gun shots and movement of people on the roads shook them to the core. “We travelled to Uzbekistan in a special Indian Air Force plane in the afternoon the same day. We felt bad that the beneficiaries who’d waited for us for so long would now have to wait for some more years to get artificial limbs,” said Sharma. Within a year, the team went back to Kabul for another camp amidst intense fighting between Taliban and Afghan fighter Ahmed Shah Masood. “The team this time urged the Indian embassy to put them in the last flight so that we could serve people,” said Sharma. “The beneficiaries negotiated with the Taliban to allow us to work. The pro-government fighters resisted Taliban for a month which allowed our team of Jaipur Foot to work for a month. Then the situation became grave with the Taliban having an upper edge. We were forced to leave,” said Sharma, who still dreams of serving the people of the war-torn nation. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/group-was-evacuated-twice-from-af-in-1996-1997/articleshow/86021197.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The government will also explore the possibility of installing CCTV cameras in major jewellery shops, the feed from which will be shared with the GST office and police stations. In the meeting convened to discuss the matter here on Tuesday, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan instructed the officials to strengthen inspection in jewellery shops. The chief minister said that searches should be intensified in all shops and business establishments where tax evasion is suspected, and if found guilty, the officials should take strict steps, including cancelling their GST registration. The chief minister asked officials to provide incentives to officers who top in tax collection, and also asked the officials to explore the possibility of installing CCTV cameras in major jewellery shops, the feed from which will be available in the GST office and police stations. Clarifying on the possibility of installing CCTVs, the chief minister said that the government does not intend to get into any kind of confrontation with gold merchants. “Everyone should remit their taxes properly. There are some, including big merchants, who are not paying their taxes properly. For those who are remitting their taxes properly, this is not an issue. But for those who are not, such a measure may cause concerns,” he said. He said that only through a proper inspection, the status of such gold business establishments would be clear. The CCTV initiative is part of such a measure to ascertain the situation there. It is not for harming anyone, but to keep a check on those deviating from the law, he said. The chief minister added that there are also some who directly sell gold at the houses of customers during occasions like marriages. Such methods are also for evading taxes and such gold should be confiscated, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/govt-to-take-strict-steps-to-curb-tax-evasion-by-jewellers/articleshow/86021219.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

According to Malviya, tribals residing in the TSP (Tribal Sub-Plan) regions were not getting employment benefits. In the Constitution, 12% seats in administrative services are reserved for tribal candidates, but most of these benefits were taken by affluent candidates or kin of those who are already into administrative services, he said. He demanded that according to the new reservation provision of June 2013, 45% seats are reserved for Scheduled Tribes of the region. “We demand that according to the new provision and based on the tribal population in the region, reservation may be provided proportionately to tribal candidates in administrative services,” he said. Speaking about the condition of tribal people in the region, Meena said people of the region were deprived of several facilities that are available to other sections of society. “The need for reservation in employment and in particular the administrative services is our demand for the day,” he said.

The associations have been protesting against the imposition of trade licence by both the civic bodies under which all businessmen have to pay annually. Traders termed it to be against their interests especially after all the losses due to the pandemic. Jaipur Vyapaar Mandal president Subhash Goyal said, “We are going to shut the entire market on September 11 if our demands are not fulfilled. We want the government to stand by the traders and not work against our interests.” Shopkeepers said the licence was a black law and until it was taken back, they would continue with the protests. Jaipur Vyapaar Mahasangh president Ravi Naiyar said this was just the beginning and soon these posters and hoardings would be put up across the city. Civic officials said Jaipur was not the first urban body to impose it. In Jodhpur Municipal Corporation-Greater, the trade licence was implemented 25 years ago. Moreover, the 15th Finance Commission has stopped grants to municipal corporations for civic work. The grant will now be given for National Clean Air Project and solid waste management based on the performance of a corporation. Now, civic bodies will have to bear its own financial liability for which the trade licence is a necessity to increase the earnings of the corporations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/city-market-assns-protest-against-new-trade-licence/articleshow/86021216.cms||---

The fine was imposed on four units, including three sugar mills and one distillery owned by Dhampur Sugar Mill Limited in western UP, and the fine has to be deposited before September 30. The units include Dhampur Sugar Mills, District Sambhal; Dhampur Sugar Mills, District Bijnor; Dhampur Distillery Unit, District Bijnor and Dhampur Sugar Mills, Meerganj, District Bareilly. The green panel pronounced its decision on September 1 while hearing a plea filed by Adil Ansari seeking strict action against the four units. In his application, Ansari alleged that DSM's four units are violating environmental norms and causing damage to the environment and local residents also. The court had issued show cause notices to the authorities concerned in 2019 and asked for explanation. Later, it observed all inspections reports since 2016 conducted by UPCB and CPCB. In its 130-page order, the court admitted that these units are violating norms. The court said, “The compensation levied by CPCB and UPPCB upon the units (earlier) is inadequate and insufficient as they have taken a very lenient view while imposing environmental compensation…. The ‘polluter pays’ principle contemplates that the units which have polluted the environment must also pay the compensation not only to the victims of pollution but also for the cost of restoring the environment. Therefore, a fine of Rs 5 crore is slapped on each unit.” “The units will deposit the compensation amount within one month from the date of judgment. In case they fail to do so, the CPCB will issue directions for closure of Units till the payment of compensation,” the NGT observed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/ngt-slapped-fine-of-rs-20-crore-on-up-sugar-mill/articleshow/86016755.cms||---

In a letter sent to the corporation, the contractor said that the plant would be shut down from Friday unless the civic body takes measures to facilitate the operations of the plant. According to some of the councillors, the contractor has complained that there has not been power supply to the plant for the past two-and-a-half months. “The contractor said that he won’t be able to continue to operate the plant in the absence of electricity supply to the plant,” said Antony Kureethra, opposition leader. At the same time, mayor M Anil Kumar said that he hadn’t got the letter from the contractor. According to Kureethra, the contractor said that the plant was working on generator for the past couple of months and also that he had to spent lakhs for buying fuel for the generator. The contractor had sent similar letter to the corporation several times threatening to stop the operations of the plant since 2012. The entire waste generated in Kochi corporation and neighbouring local bodies are being treated at Brahmapuram. Once the plant is closed, the garbage movement from the city will come to a standstill. “The contractor is using the helpless situation of the corporation for blackmailing the local body authorities and force them to approve his demands time and again,” a councillor said. Though, the contractor had threatened to stop the operations of the plant several times, he would back out after getting his demands approved by the corporation authorities. Though the agencies, including pollution control board, had found that waste was not being treated properly at the plant, the local body authorities are yet to entrust an agency or firm which can do the job in a better manner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/contractor-threatens-to-shut-compost-plant-unit/articleshow/86018812.cms||---

DCP (west) Richa Tomar said Ramdhiya has been arrested and efforts are underway to recover the weapon used in the crime. “Ramdhiya was the main shooter who shot dead Rajinder Kumar Chawla outside NHAI office,” Tomar said. File picture of police officers at the site of the firing incidentPolice on Saturday had arrested another shooter from Haryana identified as one Dharmendra Singh. According to additional DCP Ram Singh, both Dharmendra and Ramdhiya are residents of Panipat in Haryana and were given Rs 15 lakh to shoot Chawla. “Shooters were instructed to wait in a park near the NHAI office. Around 2pm, another accused Naveen visited them to give a complete description of Chawla including the shirt he was wearing so that shooters could identify their target,” Singh said. A few moments later, Chawla stepped out of the meeting for a smoke. Shooters were given a signal that the man smoking outside was their target. “Both shooters went near Chawla and Ramdhiya fire at him from a close range,” Singh said. “Ramdhiya is the main accused who had fired at Chawla. He and Dharmendra later took an auto to catch a bus for Gurgaon, from there, another suspect, Shekhar, picked them up and ferried them to their village,” Singh added. Police said both shooters were asked to come to Gurgaon on August 25. The next day, they consumed some kind of narcotic substances before leaving for Jaipur. “We had constituted a special team that tracked down all vehicles that had passed through that particular location on the day of the crime which eventually helped us unravel the entire conspiracy,” Singh added. Police on Friday had claimed of making the breakthrough in the case after four accused were identified by cops as Karandeep Sheoran (29), the owner of E5 Infrastructure Pvt Ltd, Naveen Bisla (31), Vikas Singh (33) and Amit Nehra (26). Along with two shooters and four conspirators, cops have arrested a total of six accused so far. “Investigation is underway to examine the involvement of other suspects in the conspiracy,” Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/main-shooter-who-killed-nhai-consultant-held/articleshow/86021250.cms||---

Sources said options are being explored to send a message to the entire construction sector which has been shaken after the first such case.“There is a need to set an example for everyone in this sector and instil faith in every stakeholder. We will take legal opinion on what actions can be taken against the accused highway builder. Authority engineers are our representatives and it’s our responsibility to protect them,” said an official.NHAI’s authority engineer R K Chawla was shot dead outside the authority office in Jaipur. Rajasthan Police have arrested four persons including the managing director of E5 Infrastructure Pvt Ltd who had allegedly hired sharp shooters to the kill Chawla. The deceased was employed with URS Scott Wilson, which has been acquired by Aecom. NHAI and other wings of the highways ministry appoint authority engineers to supervise government-funded projects and they are paid by the government authority.The official added that providing security to all authority engineers is not practical. “We never had such an incident in NHAI’s history. The contractors have several avenues in NHAI to address their concerns, if there is any disagreement between them and the authority engineers and problems do get resolved,” said a senior official in the highways authority.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/engr-murder-nhai-likely-to-act-against-private-firm/articleshow/86018860.cms||Dipak K Dash

---||Salem||Sugar mill employees demand wage revision||Namakkal: The non-common cadre system (non-CCS) employees of sugar mills in the state have urged the state government to implement the recommendations of the Rajeev Ranjan committee. They claimed that they would get revised salary if the state government implements the recommendations of the committee. “The categories that were included in the CCS are getting pay on par with government pay while non-CCS employees are getting wage board pay,” president of the confederation of trade unions of cooperative and public-sector sugar mills K Elavari said. He said the dual wage system has been followed since 1985. “Even after abolishing the CCS, the pay scale of CCS officers was protected by allowing them to continue to enjoy the same benefits under the erstwhile system,” Elavari said. The then chief minister M Karunanidhi formed a seven-member high-level committee headed by IAS officer Rajeev Ranjan on March 11 to remove the wage disparity between CCS and non-CCS employees. The committee handed over its recommendations to the state government on August 1, 2011. “The then AIADMK government discarded the report,” he alleged. “The committee recommended to fix wages of all employees as per government pattern,” Elavari added. “The sugar mill employees are struggling to make ends meet. It would be grateful if chief minister M K Stalin fulfills our long-pending demand of implementing the recommendations of Rajeev Ranjan committee,” Elavari said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/salem/sugar-mill-employees-demand-wage-revision/articleshow/86021264.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Nagpur||Like Buldhana, Nagpur’s Covid surge could also be temporary||NAGPUR: The district of Nagpur reported 18 new cases of Covid-19 on Tuesday, its highest one-day rise in the last several weeks. The district has been reporting new cases in double digits for three days now, but conditions in other districts of Vidarbha are still well under control. Buldhana had reported more than 20 new cases thrice last week, but the surge proved temporary. In the last three days, the daily caseload has gone down significantly in Buldhana and daily recovery count is up. The same might happen in Nagpur too. Additional district health officer Dr Rajendra Sangle said, “We continued to conduct contact tracing of Covid patients aggressively in Buldhana. Gradually, the positivity rate went down.” He added, “In the last two days, 30 patients have recovered from the district.” In Nagpur too, immediate family members of Covid patients have tested positive in the last three days. Tuesday’s list also had a few names from the families of positive patients. Majority of the distant contacts of patients, like neighbours and visitors, are testing negative. So, the increase in number of patients being noticed in last three days could be a temporary affair, and cases may go down in a week. The administration is gearing up and protective measures are in the pipeline. Meanwhile, barring Nagpur, no district in Vidarbha reported a double-digit increase in Covid-19 patients. Amravati reported zero new cases for the third day in row. Bhandara, Wardha and Yavatmal also reported zero new cases. Overall, 32 new cases were reported in the region. No Covid-19 death was reported for the seventh consecutive day of September, which is another good indicator. On the other hand, 48 patients recovered in a day, which is higher than the day’s new cases. As a result, the number of under-treatment patients went under 300 again. Now, 266 patients are under treatment in Vidarbha. More than 10,000 tests were conducted in the last 24 hours, which is nearly twice Sunday’s figure of 5,898. Chandrapur: Active patients figure further dipped to 38 with 6 recoveries against two detections on Tuesday. The day witnessed no casualty and toll remained unchanged at 1,540. A total of 87,092 patients have so far recovered out of total caseload of 88,670. Wardha: There was no new positive case from 263 tests on Tuesday while caseload, recoveries and toll remained same at 49,392, 48,062 and 1,325 respectively, as no new death or recovery was reported. The two active cases are under treatment in district as on Tuesday. Amravati: It was zero for the third day on trot as none of the 353 samples tested for Covid-19 tested positive on Tuesday. With four recoveries, the total went up to 94,462, thus bringing down the number of cases under treatment to just 28 from 32 yesterday. The deaths stayed put at 1,563 as nobody fell to the virus in the district today. Yavatmal: The district has recorded neither any death nor any new positive patients during the last 24 hours, helping the toll remained unchanged at 1,787. District administration received 945 test reports and all of them were found negative. Currently there are 10 active positive patients undergoing treatment in the hospitals. Of the 72,864 positive patients, 71,067 have recovered. The test positivity rate is 10.01 % and the death rate is 2.45 %. The daily positivity rate remained unchanged at zero on Tuesday. Buldhana: There were 15 recoveries and three new cases in the district, where 822 test results were received on Tuesday. Now, 72 patients are under treatment.

---||Delhi||Anganwadi workers take to streets to demand their dues||New Delhi: Gayatri, an Anganwadi worker for nearly 21 years now, is finding it hard to make ends meet. Her husband lost his job as a security guard and has been unemployed for nearly four months. A mother of two children, Gayatri said, “Anganwadi workers are overworked and underpaid. We are struggling to meet the basic expenses of our families.” Gayatri, who has not been able to pay the rent for her two-room house for three months, was one of the thousands of Anganwadi workers and helpers who staged a massive demonstration at Delhi Secretariat on Tuesday. She said, “We are forced to protest because we have the same problem. Apart from our routine work, we also spend hours in maintaining records both offline and online.” Gayatri added, “Considering our increased workload, our honorarium should be increased from the existing Rs 9,678 per month to Rs 18,000.” TOI reported on Tuesday how despite the workload of Anganwadi workers increasing during the pandemic, they haven’t received their full honoraria for the past few months. Against the full honorarium of Rs 9,678, the workers have got only Rs 7,003 per month. The helpers have got around Rs 3,500 a month instead of their full honorarium of Rs 4,839. “Following our protests against the central and Delhi governments, the pending arrears were transferred to our accounts on Tuesday evening. Nearly Rs 28,700 have been paid to a worker and around Rs 14,350 to a helper,” said Shivani Kaul, president, Delhi State Anganwadi Workers and Helpers Union. Mamta, a widowed Anganwadi helper, said, “I am the only earning member in my family. With a part of my honorarium pending for the past few months, I was borrowing money to make ends meet.” Apart from the honorarium, Anganwadi workers are struggling with the increased workload. For Anita Kumari, one of the most burdensome chore is distributing nutrition supplements door-to-door. For each beneficiary, this weighs a few kilograms. “Before the pandemic, the supplements were distributed at Anganwadi centres. As I am able to carry only four packets at a time, I end up making several rounds of Anganwadi centres to pick up the kits for distribution,” said Kumari. One of the protestors, Shyamli, added, “We are under pressure to encourage people in our respective areas to go for Covid vaccination. But when we ask people to do so, some of them misbehave with us.” Among the major demands of the Anganwadi workers are that all workers and helpers should be given the status of government employees and their employment should be regularised and brought under the labour laws. They also demanded the restoration of the old system of nutritional allocation and a halt to door-to-door distribution. They also want eligible workers to be promoted to the post of supervisor and eligible helpers as workers. Monika, a helper, said she had worked for over 11 years and her experience warranted a promotion to Anganwadi worker. The major duties of Anganwadi workers are to conduct online classes for pre-school children, provide food supplements to pregnant and lactating women and children and provide counselling on pregnancy and infant care. They also facilitate immunisation and health check-ups.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/anganwadi-workers-take-to-streets-to-demand-their-dues/articleshow/86021284.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

He was allowed interim bail from September 13 to 27 by special judge D E Kothalikar, who imposed certain conditions while granting relief to the jailed activist. The judge directed the accused to surrender his passport to the court before leaving for his native place. Wilson should not leave the limits of his native place Neendakara in Kollam, the court said and maintained no prayer for extension of the bail will be entertained. Wilson was arrested in June 2018 by the Pune police, which was then probing the case. He is currently in judicial custody and lodged in the Taloja jail in Navi Mumbai. Last week, Wilson, through his lawyers R Sathyanayanan and Niraj Yadav, had moved a plea in the court seeking temporary bail for two weeks for visiting his native place to attend the mass organised for his father (84) who died on August 18. His plea said as per customs, a function has been organised on the 30th day of his father’s death that falls on September 16. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Monday opposed Wilson’s plea for temporary bail. The central agency had told the court the presence of the accused for the mass was not required. The final rites of the activist's father were already over and Wilson was simply creating a ground for his release, the NIA had argued.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/rona-wilson-gets-temporary-bail-to-attend-fathers-mass/articleshow/86021301.cms||---

As of March-end, it took 408 days from the insolvency commencement date to the approval of the resolution. A thrust of the law was to provide for a time-bound resolution — ideally within 180 days, which could be extended by another 90 days. But with litigation in other forums excluded, it is now taking close to 600 days, according to data with the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Board of India. Nearly 75% of the cases have crossed the 270-day period. Since the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code (IBC) came into force in December 2016, 4,541 cases have been filed in NCLT with 2,859 closed. And of these 396 have seen the resolution plans approved, translating into a success rate of 14%. The numbers also revealed that 47% of the cases have ended up in liquidation although IBBI said that three-fourths were either sick or defunct. “A lot of the assets were badly impaired by the time the IBC process started,” said an official. The IBBI report argued that in value terms, nearly 75% of distressed companies were rescued either through the resolution route or via liquidation. “The corporate debtors (CDs) rescued had assets valued at Rs 1.46 lakh crore, while the CDs referred for liquidation had assets valued at Rs 0.49 lakh crore when they were admitted to CIRP. Thus, in value terms, around 75% of distressed assets were rescued.” The government has repeatedly pointed out that just an application before the NCLT has resulted in debtors paying up before the case is admitted. A majority of applications have therefore been withdrawn, including some high-profile ones.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/insolvency-resolution-pace-slows-by-45-in-q1/articleshow/86025205.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Bawana lake to be revived using recycled water||NEW DELHI: Water minister Satyendar Jain visited the natural sewage treatment plant (STP) at Ghoga Drain on Tuesday. He directed the officials concerned to increase its water treatment capacity from 10 lakh litres per day to 50 lakh litres per day. Jain said, “This STP is based on a constructed wetland system and treats 10 lakh litres of wastewater per day without electricity or additional power. The water treatment capacity of this STP should be increased to 50 lakh litres per day. The recycled water will be used for groundwater recharge by creating a lake in an adjacent area.” The minister also inspected the area around Sannoth Lake in Bawana. He said that around 3 MGD (million gallons per day) recycled water from Bawana’s common effluent treatment plant would be used to rejuvenate the lake. The revival work is scheduled to be completed by December 2021, he added. Jain further said that the water holding capacity of the lake would be increased so that more groundwater could be recharged. The minister also instructed Delhi State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (DSIIDC) and Irrigation & Flood Control (I&FC) department officials to clean the Bawana escape drain, which has a design discharge capacity of 680 cusecs. This task of cleaning the drain will be jointly done by DSIIDC and the I&FC department. “DSIIDC will ensure that no untreated or unauthorised drain falls into the escape drain, while the I&FC department will ensure that the existing quality of the water flowing into the drains should be improved to meet the parameters laid down by National Green Tribunal. Weirs should be made in the drain along with floating wetlands and aerators to enhance the treatment of wastewater flowing into the drain,” Jain said. The Delhi government has announced that the area around the lake will be landscaped and several facilities, including a playing area for children, a stepped picnic garden, a walkway, Chhath Puja ghat and an open gym, will be developed for the common public. The lake will have different species of trees around it, including Neem, Bombax, Plumeria and Acacia. This project is being executed by the I&FC department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bawana-lake-to-be-revived-using-recycled-water/articleshow/86021359.cms||---

The applications being received at the on-going town planning adalat here will be processed this way. People living in Vizhinjam have often raised concerns regarding delay in getting coastal regulation zone (CRZ) clearance for residential buildings. The town planning adalat which began here on Tuesday received around 14 applications for which CRZ clearance was mandatory for issuing building permit. The civic body will process such applications in respective zonal offices and awareness for submitting applications will be created among the applicants. A nodal officer will also be deputed for the initiative. “We have come to notice that when people submit applications individually, they have to deal with so much delays and hurdles even if it is for a small house with nominal dimensions. That is why we are planning to compile such applications based on zonal offices and will be submitted in compiled format to district level authorities for clearance. The hearing and related processes will be scheduled exclusively for such files,” said corporation secretary Binu Francis. Mayor Arya Rajendran said heads of standing committees and officials with the engineering section will directly supervise processing of such files. “We will assign a date for follow up of files pending clearance from CRZ or regional town planner. This will also eliminate the involvement of intermediaries who often misguide the applicants,” said the mayor. The city corporation had earlier been tasked with the arduous process of clearing applications for construction of dwellings in CRZ-2 after the district level coastal zone management committee would defer a major share of applications for the scrutiny by the corporation secretary. Airport NoC, clearance from regional town planners for construction in green zones, consent from neighbours are other types of files which will be processed in this manner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/corp-to-compile-and-submit-files-requiring-crz-clearance/articleshow/86018896.cms||Aswin J Kumar

---||Delhi||As northeast Delhi riots cases continue to drag, courts come down heavily on cops for ‘lax’ investigation||NEW DELHI: “From a hundred rabbits you can’t make a horse, a hundred suspicion don’t make a proof,” a Delhi court quoted from the Fyodor Dostoevsky classic Crime and Punishment while discharging two persons of the offence of attempt to murder in a case related to the riots in northeast Delhi in February 2020. The courts have been getting more impatient and caustic while hearing the cases in the 755 riot FIRs filed since March last year. Their complaint is the “very poor” level of police investigation in a large number of cases. Additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav, one of the four dealing with riot cases, has been particularly taken aback by the casualness with which cops have registered FIRs, investigated cases and filed chargesheets. TOI analysed the bail orders of the three other trial courts and of Delhi high court and found out how they similarly cited shoddy investigative work in their decisions. Delhi Police offered no comment to TOI on the courts pulling it up on so many occasions. In the past month, ASJ Yadav has passed several orders in which he has described the police probe as “callous”, “farcical”, “indolent”, “unproductive”, “absurd” and “inefficient”. Of the 150 or so cases heard by this court, TOI has noted such remarks in over 50. He said when history looked back at the capital’s worst communal riots since Partition, the deficiency in proper, scientific investigation would “surely torment the sentinels of democracy”. While acquitting Shah Alam, Rashid Saifi and Shadab in an arson incident case registered at Dayalpur police station, ASJ Yadav said on September 2 that the complainant/victim had become a “casualty in the matter” because the case remained unsolved because of “callous and indolent investigation; lack of supervision by the superior officers of the investigation and criminal wastage of the time and money of the taxpayer”. Yadav categorised the cops’ failure to conduct a proper investigation as “colossal” and “criminal” waste of taxpayers’ time and money. The judge was exasperated at the police putting up only five witnesses, including the victim and the investigating officer, after a lengthy investigation. The late and sudden appearance of constable Gyan Singh made the court remark that the silence and delay of producing the constable in the case gave the impression that he had been “planted or introduced to solve the case”. While discharging the same three men the following day, September 3, in a similar case, the court reiterated there were numerous lacunae in police investigation. It also noted the police’s attempt to dispose of or solve the case by clubbing different complaints together, even one of Zeeshan related to February 25, 2020, with those pertaining to February 24. On August 28, the same court, hearing the case about an attack on police personnel filed in Karawal Nagar police station, said it “really painful” to see “very poor” standard of investigation in a large number of cases related to the riots. The court said that after filing “half-baked chargesheets”, police “hardly bothers” to take the investigation to a logical end. The stern remarks came after noting that though the victims in the case were the cops themselves, the IO hadn’t even taken care to collect samples of acid/corrosive substances used in the attack and to have their chemical analysis done to establish the nature of injuries suffered by the victims. Police were jolted on July 13 when ASJ Yadav imposed a fine of Rs 25,000 on the police for “miserably failing” in conducting a fair investigation of the gunshot injury suffered by Mohammad Nisar. The court noted that Nisar’s complaint was clubbed with other complaints, different in nature, under a single FIR 64 at Bhajanpura police station and the investigation was carried out in the “most casual, callous and farcical manner”. The court observed that the cops were unaware of the names and addresses of the victims for almost three months and the search for the victims was launched only in May 2020. It further noted that though the FIR claimed the accused people had caused damage to life and properties of Hindus, not a single name from that community was mentioned in it. After police said that Nasir’s complaint had been investigated and uncovered nothing against the accused, the court directed the police to register a fresh FIR in the case. In the case related to the alleged arson and desecration at a mosque in Karawal Nagar, the sessions court noted on July 20 that the police weren’t even aware that an FIR had already been registered at the local police station by the time complainant Haji Hashim Ali approached the magistrate court. “This prima facie reflects the callous attitude/negligence on the part of the investigating agency, as it was incumbent upon it to have placed complete materials before the learned ACMM (North-East). This court is quite pained to see the lackadaisical attitude adopted by the investigating agency in the matter,” the judge said. The magistrate court had directed police to lodge a separate FIR to which the IO argued that there was no need of a separate FIR as one FIR had already clubbed Ali’s complaint with another. The sessions court was shocked at the “absurdity” of clubbing the two complaints and then arresting Ali in the case, making him both a complainant and an accused. When ASJ Yadav heard the case, police informed the court that an FIR had been registered in the mosque burning case and was being investigated. With the court coming down heavily on the cops for deficiencies, the ACP involved was demoted to inspector. Recurrences of this sort led the court to caustically observe that “the issue of clubbing and joining the investigation of different complaints into one FIR is basically to protect the accused, even if the offence is the same”. As for bail orders, Arif had been arrested for the alleged murder of a Muslim man, but the court said it “did not appeal to the senses” a Muslim would rub shoulders in such a surcharged atmosphere with an ‘unlawful assembly’ of people from another community to beat a Muslim boy to death. In another case, the court granted bail to activist Khalid Saifi, allegedly a key conspirator of the riots, saying the chargesheet showed total “non-application of mind by the police which goes to the extent of vindictiveness”. While granting bails to the accused in nine cases, the court doubted the credibility of the police witnesses. In four cases, bails were granted as the video footage supplied to the court exposed discrepancies in FIRs filed in the incidents. The bail orders given by the three other trial courts and Delhi High Court similarly point out the lacunae in police investigations. While freeing on bail JNU students Natasha Narwal, Devangana Kalita and Asif Iqbal Tanha, booked under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, the high court remarked that in its anxiety to suppress dissent, “the State has blurred the line between the constitutionally guaranteed ‘right to protest’ and ‘terrorist activity’”. A bench of justices Siddharth Mridul and Anup Jairam Bhambhani said, “If such blurring gains traction, democracy would be in peril.” On June 6, the high court granted bail to three accused, observing that the forming of an unlawful assembly at a different spot would not implicate them as members of an unlawful assembly in another place. The lower courts too have been aghast at the gaps. While acquitting Suresh on July 20, ASJ Amitabh Rawat wondered at the absurdity of just one person in an unlawful assembly of over 100 people being identified. The case related to policemen allegedly beating people and forcing them to sing the national anthem, and till August this year, only three policemen had been identified. While acquitting Imran and Babu of offences under the Arms Act for the injuring Rahul in the Welcome area, ASJ Rawat wondered how a case of attempt to murder could be made out against the two when the victim was not approached by the cops, in fact, hadn’t ever been seen by police. The same court granted bail to Furkan in December. The judge noted that the offence under Section 436 IPC (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to destroy house, etc) for which Furkan was booked for burning a car as part of a mob in Jafrabad was “debatable”. The section was applicable only when the building was a residence or being ordinarily used as a place of worship, while the car was parked on a public road, the court said. The courts pointed out the consequences the judicial system, the accused and the victims faced due to the callous police investigations. In one of his orders, ASJ Yadav, “There are a large number of accused persons languishing in jail for the last 1.5 years merely on account of the fact that trials in their cases weren’t being initiated. Cops seem to be still busy filing supplementary chargesheets. The precious judicial time of this court is being wasted in giving dates in those cases. A lot of time of this court is being consumed by cases like the present one, where there is hardly any investigation carried out by police. The case appears to have been solved merely by filing this chargesheet without any real effort being made to trace the eyewitnesses, real accused persons and technical evidence.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/as-riots-cases-continue-to-drag-courts-come-down-heavily-on-cops-for-lax-investigation/articleshow/86018880.cms||Usha Das
---||Delhi||Delhi: Two cops held for extorting money from businessmen||NEW DELHI: Two constables posted with the First Battalion of Delhi Police have been arrested for allegedly extorting money from two businessmen in central Delhi’s Karol Bagh. The constables posed as trademark officials and allegedly told the traders that they were using a wrong trademark to extort from them. Recently, a cloth businessman from Karol Bagh in central Delhi complained to the cops that some men had tried to extort Rs 10 lakh from him. During investigation, it turned out that the accused men were policemen. Another person involved in the crime was also arrested. Initially, a case of kidnapping for ransom was registered, but later other IPC sections were added. The accused policemen have been identified as Sumit and Pramod and their associate as Manjeet. A senior police officer claimed that 10-15 days ago, a businessman told them that his nephew and he were running a jeans unit. Two men claiming to be trademark officials reached their factory and told them that action would be taken against them as they were using fake labels. The accused took the nephew in their car and made him call the businessman to give Rs 3 lakh. He was let off after they were paid the money. The victims then reached the police station and filed a complaint. “The nephew said he was taken in a black car with tinted glasses, which was our first clue. CCTV footage was scanned and the car was identified. The car owner was the wife of one of the accused cops. When our team met her, it was found that on the days mentioned the cop was driving the car. Upon interrogation, he gave the names of the other accused, following which they were arrested,” said a senior police officer. During investigation, it came to the fore that a spare parts businessman also underwent the same trauma with a similar modus operandi. The accused cops had asked for more money, but were only able to get Rs 1.5 lakh. The accused constables lived in Rohini and had started this extortion gang a couple of months ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/two-cops-held-for-extorting-money-from-businessmen/articleshow/86018917.cms||---

Till September 3, 2,485 vehicles out of approximately 3,500 private emergency vehicles have been installed with the device across the state. The officials claimed that they have largely received positive response from service providers and a large number of them were fitted with the device during the camps set in the districts for the same. “The aim is not to penalise but to encourage ambulance providers to fit GPS trackers. Fortunately, most of them are willing to follow the order. Initially we had written in the order that the ambulances should have trackers in a month’s time. However, there is no fixed deadline and it is an ongoing process,” said an official. The department has been taking various measures to ensure that ambulance providers do not take undue advantage of the pandemic. In a bid to ensure that the ambulance providers do not overcharge the patients we have set up a control room at the department headquarters in Jaipur which is functional 24/7. The aggrieved person can call on 0141-2708318 in case the ambulance provider charges more than the fixed fare, refuses to ply the patient or body or charges extra for night transportation etc. The department has also put up hoardings regarding the fare in several places including outside hospitals. RTO teams conduct regular checking of ambulances. Officials claimed that while it is difficult to take action against emergency service vehicles, in extreme cases, they have suspended the licence of drivers who overcharged patients. The fitness certificate of the vehicle can also be cancelled in case a service provider is found to flout any norms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/nearly-2-5k-pvt-ambulances-fitted-with-gps/articleshow/86021344.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Greenhouse gas emissions from buildings to go up 3.5 times by 2050’||MUMBAI: Greenhouse gas emissions from residential, commercial and institutional buildings in Mumbai are estimated to go up 3.3 times by 2050, showed a recent analysis by the World Resources Institute (WRI) India. This, considering that power plants and buildings are responsible for over 60% of the city’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, it added. The analysis, based on the current consumption patte-rns, was shared at the stakeh-older consultations’ meeting held on Tuesday to draft Mu-mbai’s Climate Action Plan. In his presentation, Mehul Patel, manager of the climate programme at WRI India, said that residential, commercial and institutional buildings’ GHG emissions are dominated by electricity and LPG. “The key sources are appliances like air conditioners, geysers, refrigerators, fans, LPG, PNG, kerosene,” he said. “The analysis also found that while Mumbai’s electricity demand is 3,400-3,600MW, its rooftop solar potential is nearly half of this demand—1,724MW comprising 1,300MW from residential buildings and the rest from industrial and educational buildings. Andheri west (K-West ward) and Borivli (R-Central ward) have the highest solar potential,” he added. A further breakup showed that the maximum GHG emissions—32%—came in from the residential sector, followed by 30% from the transport sector. The panelists also discussed strategies for dealing with the rapid increase in emission levels, which include decentralizing clean energy systems, retrofitting existing infrastructure and encouragi-ng changes in building design to reduce energy consumption. Sunil Dahiya, analyst from Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, said that there is a close relation between air pollution and climate change. “Mumbai is undoubtedly one of the most polluted cities. Most of the power plants have not installed flue-gas desulfurization technology. We need to reduce dependence on fossil fuel energy and also from the central grid to decentralized methodology,” he said. Ashish Fernandes, CEO of Climate Risk Horizons, a research and advisory consultancy, said: “Mumbai being the economic powerhouse, it’s essential to look at what can be done to mitigate the issues. These need to be framed in such a way that it’s a win-win for all, like tapping into solar and renewable energy, starting from civic buildings, schools and hospitals.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-greenhouse-gas-emissions-from-bldgs-to-go-up-3-5-times-by-2050/articleshow/86023229.cms||Richa Pinto

Nokkukooli is not a labour dispute. It is illegal extortion that cannot be resolved by discussions, but by invoking laws to prevent extortion. The government will deal with it using legal provisions, he said on Tuesday. Rajeeve made it clear that government will not allow ‘lightning’ strikes in the industrial sector. By and large, trade unions are not resorting to this form of strike. But there are reports of some isolated cases and government will take stern action, he added. Rajeeve said employees must explore the possibilities of augmenting productivity. Though government is keen on protecting public sector, it is not absolute protection; PSUs have to be strengthened and protected. Practices like overtime allowances to workers must be reduced to the maximum extent possible. There must be serious studies to identify how highly-qualified labour from Kerala is able to display high efficiency outside and low levels of productivity within the state, he said. Rajeeve disclosed that government was ready to permit private industrial estates in Kerala. He added that the government was planning to prepare an inventory of land available with the public sector industrial units and government institutions to explore the possibility of utilizing surplus land for other purposes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/govt-will-take-action-against-nokkukooli/articleshow/86021371.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Kochi||Dissenting priests meet archbishop over changes in Holy Mass||Thrissur: The priests of different parishes in Thrissur archdiocese who are opposed to the changes proposed by the bishops’ synod of the Syro Malabar Church (SMC) in the conduct of the Holy Mass, on Tuesday submitted a memorandum to the Archbishop Mar Andrews Thazhath. The dissenting priests demanded that the directive of the synod that all churches under SMC should celebrate the mass facing the altar must be withdrawn. They said the Janabhimukha Kurbana (conduct of the Holy Mass facing the faithful) was being conducted in various churches for the last 52years. The priests are demanding that the Janabhimukha Kurbana should be continued, said Father Francis Muttath, who is one of the dissenting priests. According to them, a memorandum signed by 230 of the nearly 330 working priests in the archdiocese, had been handed over to the archbishop. But the church leadership was going ahead with the changes in the Holy Mass, said Father John Ayyankanayil, another dissenting priest. Father Davies Chakkalakkal said the decision to change the mode of celebrating the Holy Mass was taken without proper discussions. The priests and faithful are opposed to the proposed changes, he said. Pointing out that the Holy Mass was primarily meant to uplift the faithful, Father Paul Arakkal said turning the back to the faithful by the priest during the mass would be tantamount to showing disrespect to them. It will only trigger divisive mentality among the people, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/dissenting-priests-meet-archbishop-over-changes-in-holy-mass/articleshow/86021414.cms||---
---||Meerut||Dalit boy ‘hangs self’ in juvenile home after upper caste inmates ‘break rib’||Meerut: A Dalit boy from Amroha, 16, was found hanging in the bathroom of a juvenile home in Bulandshahr. He had been sent to the centre on July 30 after being held for “kidnapping” an upper caste girl he had eloped with. Since then, he had been allegedly beaten up by dominant caste inmates for his “transgression” and for “daring to” run away with the upper caste girl, his family said. “On Monday, around 5pm, I got a call telling me my son had hanged himself. But I am certain he was murdered,” his father said in the complaint, on the basis of which an FIR was lodged against eight persons — five inmates, the girl’s parents and her uncle — for murder, criminal conspiracy and under the SC/ST Act on Tuesday. District probation officer Nagender Pal Singh said a high-level probe has been ordered into the case. “I had met him two days before that and he said he was in deep pain. He was crying and asking me to get him out because inmates, in collusion with juvenile home staffers, would thrash him brutally,” his father, a hawker, said. “He had told me they broke his rib and he found it difficult to breathe. His hip bone had also been injured. What could I do? I told him I was trying hard to get him out. Now, he’s dead.” The boy, along with four others, had run away from the home on August 16. “Because he was tortured incessantly,” his father said in the complaint. “On August 18, I submitted a written application to the court to provide him protection.” He also made his son surrender. “The inmates, of a dominant caste, would admonish my son, asking how he could dare to run away with an upper caste girl and hurl caste abuses at him. Whenever I visited, I would request the staffers to help him. But every time we complained, he was beaten up more.” The boy’s uncle said the case for which he was held was the reason why they believe the girl’s family may have been involved. “Our boy was just 16. So was the girl, who lived with her family on the upper floor of our house in Amroha on rent. They fell in love but the family moved out. The two stayed in touch,” he added. “The girl asked our boy to meet him and take her away. He made the mistake of eloping with her. The girl’s family filed a police complaint and he was held.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/dalit-boy-hangs-self-in-juvenile-home-after-upper-caste-inmates-break-rib/articleshow/86016844.cms||Sandeep Rai

---||Hyderabad||Student among two held for peddling hashish oil in Hyderabad||HYDERABAD: Task Force sleuths have arrested two peddlers allegedly selling hashish oil to students and other clients in the city. They also seized 25 vials of the contraband along with two cell phones from their possession. Task Force sleuths along with SR Nagar police have arrested Md Ibrahim Khan, 30, a labourer from Borabanda, and Md Khaja Mubeenuddin, 22, a student from Yousufguda, in possession of 25 vials of hashish oil. “Each vial contains five milliliters of hashish oil and the value of the total contraband seized by our team was Rs 1 lakh,” South Zone Task force inspector Raghavendra said. Main accused Md Mahabub Ali of Borabanda is a close friend of Ibrahim. Ali is on the run and he was earlier involved in three cases of robbery and attempt to murder under the Madhapur PS limits. According to police, Ali and Ibrahim were addicted to ganja and hashish. “The duo along with Mubeen decided to procure hashish oil from suppliers in Visakhapatnam district at the price of Rs 1,000 per vial and sell it in Hyderabad for Rs 3,000 to Rs 4,000 a vial,” the inspector said. On interrogation, the two arrested accused confessed that they have been targeting youngsters by offering them the contraband for less than the market price and once they were addicted, the orders would increase through word of mouth and the profits too will follow.

At the carnival, Sisodia said, big businesses would be requested to invest in the ideas of the students.Explaining the aim behind the Entrepreneurship Mindset Curriculum (EMC) in government schools, Sisodia said that the way to create or provide employment was by not depending on the promises of political leaders or on economic reports. “Jobs in the country will not be created by assurances from World Bank, Niti Aayog and leaders, but through programmes like EMC and Business Blasters,” said the deputy CM. “Through these programmes, we want not an army of job seekers to emerge from schools and colleges, but entrepreneurs who create employment for the youth of the country.”On Tuesday, the scheme called Business Blasters was also launched to provide students of classes XI and XII of all Delhi government schools with Rs 2,000 as seed money for commercial projects that the students, individually or in groups, can work on. “The launch of Business Blasters will form the foundation of a developed India,” Sisodia said with optimism. “If we start EMC and Business Blasters curricula in all the schools of the country, then that day isn’t far away when we can change history. India will no longer be a developing country, but a developed one. Children emerging from Delhi schools will be job providers, not those lining up to get jobs.”Sisodia said the seed money scheme wouldn’t be confined to schools. “It is chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s vision to see an entrepreneurial competition at the district and state levels,” said the deputy CM. “There will also be an entrepreneurship carnival to showcase the students’ efforts and to rope in big companies to invest in such enterprises.”The top 10 earning groups or individuals will be given direct admission to BBA and other business-oriented courses in Delhi Technological University, Netaji Subhas University of Technology, Indira Gandhi Technical University for Women and Indraprastha University.As part of the launch, the 41 students who were part of the pilot phase of the scheme interacted with Nitin Saluja, founder of tea café chain Chaayos, Mekin Maheswari, founder of entrepreneurship foundation Udhyam Group, and Magsaysay Award winner Anshul Gupta, founder of community development NGO Goonj.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rs-2k-seed-money-for-class-xi-xii-kids-biz-blasters-plan-set-rolling/articleshow/86018993.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Narendra Dabholkar murder case: Virendrasinh Tawde, 3 others to be tried for terror, says court||PUNE: The court of special UAPA judge S R Navander here on Monday passed an order stating that charges relating to terrorism, besides murder and criminal conspiracy, among others, will be framed against ENT surgeon and Sanatan Sanstha operative Virendrasinh Tawde and three others in the August 20, 2013, murder of rationalist Narendra Dabholkar. Sachin Andure and Sharad Kalaskar, the two men accused by the CBI of having shot Dabholkar, and Vikram Bhave, who is accused of assisting the duo in a recce of the crime spot, the escape route and related aspects, are also to be tried for terrorism. The CBI described Tawde, who is from Panvel, as a key conspirator in the case. The court said Mumbai lawyer Sanjeev Punalekar, who is among the five accused against whom the CBI filed chargesheets in the case, will be tried only for the offence under Section 201 (destruction of evidence) of the IPC in view of the evidence placed on record against him. It is the CBI case that Punalekar had advised Kalaskar to destroy the firearms allegedly used in the murder. The framing of charges will be done at the next hearing on September 15. The CBI had sought trial of all five accused under Section 16 (terrorism) of the UAPA, sections 302 (murder), 120-B (criminal conspiracy), 34 (common intention) and 201 (evidence destruction) of the IPC, besides sections 3 (25), 27 (1) and 27 (3) of the Arms Act. Defence lawyer Virendra Ichalkaranjikar, appearing via video-conferencing, argued that the court should decide the bail plea of the accused before framing charges. The court said it cannot decide the bail plea as the matter was pending in the high court. The court read out the charges to the accused, but could not proceed with framing of charges as Tawde and Andure, who were produced via video-conferencing from Yerawada jail here and Aurangabad jail, respectively, sought a week’s time to enable them meet and consult their family and lawyers on the point of pleading guilty or not guilty. Bhave, who is out on bail granted by the high court, was present in court while Kalaskar, who is lodged in Arthur Road jail in Mumbai, could not be produced via video-conferencing owing to a technical issue. Punalekar appeared via video-conferencing from his Mumbai office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/court-tawde-3-others-to-be-tried-for-terror/articleshow/86023258.cms||Asseem Shaikh
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: 400 applications under PMAY rejected citing landline telephone connections||JAIPUR: Applications for free housing under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) of over 400 families belonging to Sahariya and Gadiya Lohar tribes in Baran district have been rejected by the local administration saying that they possess landline phones. A local NGO has challenged the report of the local administration by stating that 90% of families are living in shanties and don’t have a power connection, let alone landline phones. The PMAY scheme is for families that don’t possess landlines, phones, fridges, bikes or own houses. Naresh Patel, a local social activist said that they have verified most of the applicants to learn that they do not possess any movable and non-movable assets. “In Ranibarod gram panchayat, on our reality check, all 22 applicants belonging to Sahariyas and Gadiya Lohars were found to be living on the roadside with no basic facilities,” said Patel. The matter came to light after the applications of all identified beneficiaries were rejected by the local administration in August third week. The families were informed by their gram panchayat. The applicants for the scheme are recommended by their respective gram panchayats (GPs). It is scrutinised by the sarpanch and pradhan before it is sent to the zila parishad. The rejected applicants are from over 40 GPs. The rejection has dashed the dreams of beneficiaries who are running from pillar to post to get the correction done. Sub-divisional officer, Kishanganj Prahlad Ram Dudi told TOI, “Once the application is filed manually, the process of scrutinising the application is online. The form is linked with aadhaar card and whether the family owns any of the items that debar them from the scheme is done automatically. It appears that the rejection was made due to some technical error.” Krishna Shukla, CEO, zila parishad, told TOI that the concerned officials have been told to revise the applications. “The changes in the application can be made in the list once the revised list is prepared,” said Shukla. Under the PMAY, the Central government provides the aid of Rs 1.5 lakh to the beneficiary for building a house on his/her own land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/400-applications-under-pmay-rejected-citing-landline-telephone-connections/articleshow/86021411.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Nagpur: 11 vaccinated MBBS students test Covid positive, 100 quarantined||NAGPUR: Ten girls and one boy pursuing first-year MBBS at Datta Meghe Medical College (DMMC) at Wanadongri tested Covid positive on Monday. A second-year MBBS student of NKP Salve Institute of Medical Sciences (NSIMS) too tested positive a day ago. All the 150 first-year MBBS students had been vaccinated with both doses in February and March under the healthcare worker (HCW) category by the college, DMMC dean Dr Dilip Gode told TOI. This is the first MBBS batch of the college. Many students and residents at IGGMCH and GMCH too have complained of high fever. Officials from both colleges said most of them are RTPCR negative but positive for dengue. Some of the infected DMMC students complained of feverish feeling while others are completely asymptomatic. Dr Gode said all are doing well and don’t have any major health issue due to vaccination. “Their SPO2 levels are maintained at 98%,” he said. The NSIMS student belonged to Patna, and went home with his parents. He was tested after complaint of fever. Four more students who came in his contact were tested but were found negative on Tuesday, officials said. The DMMC dean informed that the infected students have been admitted in a special ward of Shalinitai Meghe Hospital and Research Centre (SMHRC), where the Dedicated Covid Hospital had been shut after second wave receded a couple of months ago. The college has informed the parents of the students and they are being counselled. Over 100 students, including the infected ones, stay on the campus hostel. The college would be conducting RTPCR tests of all students on Wednesday. The remaining 50 belong to the city and have been advised home isolation and testing. The remaining hostelites have been quarantined in their hostel rooms and doctors are checking each one of them, the dean said. The sole boy to test positive is a day scholar and lives in the city, Dr Gode said. The dean said contact tracing has started but it would be difficult to say from where the students got infected. “Two girls had fever. We assumed it could be dengue. They were also tested for Covid and found positive. Their close contacts too tested positive. We have taken their history and found no one travelled to the city in the last one week. They have classes till 5.30pm and have to be back by 9.30pm at the hostel. As exams are coming up, they told us they were in the hostels even on Sunday,” the dean said. Sources said one of the possible sources of infection could be food ordered from outside and birthday celebrations in the hostel. The dean said this was the first time any student tested positive after reopening of physical classes in June. The numbers were reported in Tuesday’s data by the Nagpur civil surgeon’s office. The sudden spike increased the daily cases to 18. While 10 of them are DMMC students, 8 are from the city. Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) officials said six are new cases and two are high risk close contacts of a positive person. Till a couple of days back, the district had been reporting single digit case, mostly one or two. In fact, rural parts, including Hingna tehsil where the colleges are located, had not reported a single case for 12 days in August-end. The latest spike in cases comes a day after guardian minister Nitin Raut said the district would be re-imposing restrictions on non-essential establishments in view of the projected third wave.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/11-vaxxed-mbbs-students-test-positive-100-classmates-quarantined/articleshow/86021420.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan government may revise SOPs for online cab drivers||JAIPUR: The transport department will revise the standard operating procedure (SOP) for verifying drivers of online cab services in Rajasthan after officials received complaints about misbehaviour with passengers. Last month, the department officials met the representatives of the companies concerned but were not satisfied with the process followed by them. Hence, it was decided to make SOP stricter. “We met the representatives of the online cab services but the documents and process for recruitment of drivers shared by them were not satisfactory. It started with the Uber service, but we will talk to Ola as well, as driver verification process must be done in a detailed manner so that their backgrounds are properly checked. While we do have an SOP in place for the same, we are deliberating over revising it as passengers’ security is paramount. We will hold a meeting with the representatives of the cab services again this week to discuss the same,” said an official of the transport department. According to officials, the cab services have an online system where most of the times, the customers do not give explicit reason for low rating to a driver due to the apprehension of being identified. Even the cab companies only take the registration details of the vehicles and the licence information of the driver. The officials claimed that they started to look into the verification of the drivers after an informal complaint came to their notice in which a woman was travelling with a child in a cab when the driver allegedly misbehaved with them. The drivers’ licences are issued by the RTOs and necessary action can be taken in case of instances of misdemeanour. All cab drivers are required to procure a certificate from the police stating that the driver in question has no criminal record along with address proof etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-may-revise-sops-for-online-cab-drivers/articleshow/86021439.cms||---

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: RERC raises net metering load capacity up to 500KW||JAIPUR: Ending a prolonged uncertainty over the fate of rooftop solar projects, Rajasthan Electricity Regulatory Commission (RERC) in an order on Tuesday increased net metering load capacity up to 500 kiloxwatt (KW) from earlier provision of 10kW. In the order it said, “Net metering arrangement shall be applicable for loads up to 500 KW or up to the sanctioned load, whichever is lower, for all categories of the consumers. However, the Commission may take further view on other issues raised by the discoms in their response at a later stage by following the due procedure.” TOI on Tuesday reported that some states like Haryana and Punjab had already followed the amendments of Union ministry of power and increased the load to 500KW. In fact, Tamil Nadu and Jharkhand have also raised the ceiling to 500KW. The solar industry in the state had vehemently protested RERC’s rules that restricted the net metering benefits to 10KW. They had argued that without the benefits of net metering the rooftop projects above 10KW would not be viable. RERC CMD Subodh Agarwal said, “The order will help rooftop segment gain momentum and contribute to our efforts to improve Rajasthan’s standing as a solar hub in the country. This will also complement our policy thrust and help achieve budget announcements made by the chief minister.” While the industry welcomed the decision, it also said that the additional surcharges on RESCO projects (Renewable Energy Service Company, which invests and sets up plants on customers’ locations and charges fees for units) has not been waived off in the current order. Rajasthan Solar Association president Sunil Bansal said, “The order will actually revive the industry. But we want cross subsidies and surcharges to go. Otherwise, service providers will not find the projects financially feasible and invest.” Under net metering, the consumer uses cheaper rooftop solar power instead of the costly discom power. As per old rules, projects above 10KW were required to come under gross billing or metering which requires them to pay normal electricity rate to discoms even though they uses cheap power from its rooftop plant. In return, the discoms were to pay the rooftop projects owners under gross metering at rates discovered through auction along with 25% incentive which is estimated to be far lower than the discom rates of around Rs 8 per unit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rerc-raises-net-metering-load-capacity-up-to-500kw/articleshow/86021426.cms||---

If any shop is found selling PoP idols, not just the idols, the establishment will also be sealed, said Tiwari. “If required, police protection will be sought during the drive,” said the municipal commissioner. A decision to this effect was taken at a meeting chaired by the mayor and civic chief and attended by representatives of NGOs and NMC officials from 10 zones. Radhakrishnan also directed NMC zonal officials to implement the prescribed height restriction of idols for both, individual (2ft) and sarvajanik mandals (4ft). NMC has already started seizure drive of PoP idols from Monday. In the last two days, the civic body’s solid waste management team and nuisance detection squad (NDS) have seized 111 PoP idols. On Tuesday, the second day of the drive, the team seized 90 idols after inspecting 106 shops in five zones — Laxminagar, Dharampeth, Hanuman Nagar and Nehru Nagar. The NDS team also recovered fines worth Rs1.21 lakh from the shopkeepers. In Dharampeth zone, volunteers including those from Green Vigil Foundation like founder Kaustav Chatterjee, Surabhi Jaiswal, Mehul Kosurkar and Shriya Joge helped the NMC team in identifying PoP idols. The team here seized 27 idols and recovered Rs30,000 fine. Hanuman Nagar zone recorded the highest number of offences. The NDS team here inspected 25 shops and seized 60 PoP idols and recovered Rs50,000 fine. Mangalwari zone too seized three PoP idols by inspecting 15 shops.

Laxmi Nagar zone team inspected 15 shops and imposed Rs10,000 fine on the defaulters. In connection with Ganesh Utsav, shops selling idols have been set up at various places in the city. However, NMC’s prior permission is a must. “While inspecting the shops, it should be ascertained whether they (shopkeepers) have the NMC permission or not. If not, action should be taken against the shop owner concerned,” the mayor said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-to-seal-shops-selling-pop-idols-seizure-drive-started/articleshow/86021488.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

Ruling on a special leave petition filed by Anubhav Ravi, an AIADMK functionary, who opposed further investigation, saying it would delay the ongoing trial in the Nilgiris sessions court, a bench headed by Justice D Y Chandrachud sought to dismiss the petition. But it then declared it as withdrawn after senior counsel Siddharth Luthra, representing Ravi, sought the court’s permission to withdraw the plea. The order may have political ramifications as decks have now been cleared for the TN police to summon and interrogate witnesses and suspects. The case concerns the murder of a security guard and burglary at Kodanad estate, co-owned by former CM Jayalalithaa and her friend V K Sasikala, in 2017. Sasikala was lodged in a Bengaluru jail then. Chargesheet had been filed against 11 suspects and the trial had reached an advanced stage when the new DMK government cited several loopholes and began further probe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/cant-stop-probe-in-kodanad-case-truth-must-come-out-sc/articleshow/86016893.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Congress wins five deputy zila pramukh posts in Jaipur, BJP bags 1||JAIPUR: The up-zila pramukh (deputy zila pramukh) and up-pradhan (deputy pradhan) elections held on Tuesday also witnessed many upsets. The Congress won five out of six deputy zila pramukh posts leaving one for the BJP. A day earlier, the Congress and BJP shared three zilla pramukh posts each. The Congress snatched Jaipur and Bharatpur from the BJP apart from Dausa, Jodhpur and Sawai Madhopur. The BJP had to remained satisfied with Sirohi. In the election of the zila pramukh in Jaipur on Monday, the BJP had defeated the Congress despite the latter having a majority. But in the election of the deputy zila pramukh, the Congress avenged its defeat by winning by a vote. The Congress candidate won in Bharatpur with the support of independents. Out of the results for uppradhan in 77 panchyayat samitis announced, the Congress won in 46, three less than its pradhan posts, while the BJP increased its tally by two to 27. Independents won in 3 and one went to RLP. In one panchayat samiti, no candidate filed nomination on time. In the 22 panchayat samitis in Jaipur, the BJP changed its position in Dudu and Kotputli and got its deputy pradhan elected. The most interesting election was that of Dudu, Paota and Kotputli where the BJP won all three. Independent MLA and former Congress minister Babulal Nagar could not win the deputy pradhan post in Dudu where a day earlier he managed to elect his candidate for the post of pradhan. Out of 22 panchayat samitis in Jaipur, Congress manged to elect its deputy pradhan only in 11 and BJP in 10. In the pradhan elections, 13 out of 22 were won by the Congress, while 9 had gone to BJP. In Mojmabad panchayat samiti, no candidate could reach on time to file nomination, due to which this seat remained vacant. BJP candidate Suvalal reached office only at 11.09 am, on which the returning officer refused to accept the application. In Kotputli panchayat samiti, out of 27 seats, BJP won 9, Congress 8, Independents 7 and Rashtriya Loktantrik Party (RLP) 3. After losing the election of pradhan, BJP played bets on independent candidate Manju Devi for deputy pradhan. The Congress also thought it better to bet on an independent instead of its candidate. But Congress's Bina Devi rebelled and contested the independent resulting in the victory of the BJP there. In Paota panchayat samiti, the election of uppradhan was interesting. The BJP had elected its pradhan a day earlier with the help of RLP. But on Tuesday, during the deputy pradhan election, the BJP declared Rajendra Singh as their candidate, instead of offering the post to the RLP. Angered by this, RLP member Suman Devi contested as an Independent. Devi was hopeful of getting support of Congress, but here also some of Congress members cross voted and Rajendra Singh came out victorious.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/congress-wins-5-deputy-zila-pramukh-posts-bjp-bags-1/articleshow/86021494.cms||---

---||Ranchi||Assembly passes supplementary budget after walkout by BJP MLAs||Ranchi: The Jharkhand Vidhan Sabha on Tuesday passed the supplementary budget of Rs 4,684.93 crore tabled by finance minister Rameshwar Oraon through voice vote after BJP lawmakers staged a walkout to protest the state government's unflinching stance to their demand of amending the new recruitment regulations for third and fourth grade jobs in Jharkhand government. A debate on the budget was initiated by Bagodar MLA Binod Kumar Singh after he brought a cut motion. Singh claimed that the supplementary budget did not focus on the need to bolster the state’s primary and secondary healthcare infrastructure whose loopholes were exposed during the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic earlier this year. The supplementary budget had sought Rs 279 crore for health, Rs 1,786 crore for power, Rs 1,000 crore for mining, Rs 284 crore for rural affairs and Rs 337 crore for home department. BJP lawmakers descended to the well seeking a rollback of the new recruitment policy after Speaker Rabindra Nath Mahto overruled Bhawanathpur MLA Bhanu Pratap Shahi’s question where he asked the treasury bench to come clean on the cut-off date for the eligibility. Amid high-pitched sloganeering, Ranchi MLA C P Singh questioned why did the government drop Hindi, Bhojpuri, Angika and Maghi as second languages in the eligibility criteria for the posts. “Since morning, our MLAs are protesting and demanding a roll back of the new regulations but the arrogant government is not paying heed,” Singh said. Singh’s remarks, where he termed health minister Banna Gupta as a “tempo agent”, sparked dissent in treasury benches. The lawmakers descended to the well and sought an apology from Singh. The impasse was lifted after Singh took back his words. Earlier in the day, state labour minister Satyanand Bhokta tabled the select committee’s report on the Jharkhand State Employment of Local Candidates Bill of 2021. The bill, which provisions 75% job reservation in the private sector for local candidates, had been sent to the select committee for a re-look in the budget session after 22 MLAs objected to its provisions. The select committee, which consisted ofMLAs Pradeep Yadav, Mathura Prasad Mahto, Ramdas Soren, Ramchandra Chandravanshi and Binod Kumar Singh, has recommended that a monitoring committee will be set up in each district under the chairmanship of respective deputy commissioners to ensure that new units will have to comply with the reservation policy. “The committee will also consist of local MLA and district labour officials,” Bhokta told TOI before tabling the report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/assembly-passes-supplementary-budget-after-walkout-by-bjp-mlas/articleshow/86018914.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||Ranchi||PIL filed in Jharkhand HC over allocation of namaz room in assembly||RANCHI: A person filed a public interest litigation (PIL) in the Jharkhand high court on Tuesday against the allocation of a separate room to offer namaz inside the state assembly building. Currently, the 81-member Jharkhand Legislative Assembly has four Muslim MLAs of whom two are from Congress — Irfan Ansari and Alamgir Alam. The other two — Dr Sarfaraz Ahmad and Haji Hussain Ansari — belong to the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM). Dubbing the move the assembly as a strike against secularism, petitioner Bhairav Singh said the assembly is a public building and creating or allocating a room for a special class or community is against the secular and the social fabric of society at large. His petition further said the expenditure of the assembly from the public exchequer in allocating a room for the minority community to offer prayers is also a violation of the secular rights of other communities that will stand discriminated. The petition further said the circular issued on the order of the speaker on September 2 allocating room number TW348 for offering namaz by the minority community should be scrapped. Singh has made speaker Rabindra Nath Mahto and the secretary of the assembly as a party in the case. Petitioner Singh had earlier protested against the beheading of a girl in Ranchi and whose body was found from Ormanjhi here. Later, Singh took part in the stone-pelting against the chief minister’s carcade during a protest by BJP and other right-wing groups at Kishoreganj against the incident. He was arrested in January this year on charges of orchestrating the stone-pelting incident and came out of jail last month after the high court granted him bail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/pil-filed-in-hc-over-allocation-of-namaz-room-in-assembly/articleshow/86019031.cms||---
---||Ranchi||‘MLAs only fighting with each other, neglecting key issues’||Ranchi: Jobseekers in the state on Tuesday rued the disruptions in the proceedings of the House during the ongoing monsoon session and said the legislators should be discussing a host of burning issues like unemployment and price hike facing Jharkhand. Shintu Singh, a member of the Ekikrit Para Sikshak Sangharsh Morcha, said, “Despite the education minister’s assurance of providing us service condition on a par with our counterparts in Bihar, the decision in this regard is getting delayed. The representatives should have raised our issue before the state assembly and discussed it.” Rajiv Tiwari of the Jharkhand Homeguard Welfare Association said his organization had staged a demonstration for 35 days in front of the Vidhan Sabha earlier this year for more work and better service conditions. He said several of their demands including a hike in honorarium has not yet been fulfilled. “However our issues are put in the back-burner by the opposition and the ruling MLAs at present. They are fighting instead of discussing our demands,” he said. A section of the ruling parties and the opposition parties had also called for amendments to employment policy but the policy has not been taken up in the House. An aspirant for Jharkhand Public Service Commission civil services examination, Shashi Panna, said it is quite disappointing that the employment policy has not been discussed in the House so far. He said the opposition legislators should have argued their points strongly to persuade the government to amend the policy. Secretary of the Jharkhand Sahayak Pradhyapak Sangh, Jainedra Kumar, also said the MLAs are a disappointment. He said, “We have been demanding extension of the upper age limit to 62 and fixation of the wages for long. We have approached many MLAs with our demands but have faced disappointment. During the current session, the focus of MLAs is on insignificant issues.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/mlas-only-fighting-with-each-other-neglecting-key-issues/articleshow/86018962.cms||Sanjay Sahay
