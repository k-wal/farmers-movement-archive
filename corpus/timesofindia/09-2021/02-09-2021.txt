Ida was the fifth most powerful storm to strike the US when it hit Louisiana on Sunday with maximum winds of 150 mph (240 kph), likely causing tens of billions of dollars in flood, wind and other damage, including to the electrical grid. More than 1 million homes and businesses in Louisiana and Mississippi were without power after Ida toppled a major transmission tower and knocked out thousands of miles of lines and hundreds of substations. New Orleans was plunged into total darkness at one point; power began returning to the city on Wednesday. The White House says Biden has been getting regular updates on the storm and its aftermath. He has held several conference calls with governors and local officials to discuss preparations and needs after the storm, and has received briefings from FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell. FEMA had sent tons of supplies, including generators, tarps and other materials into the region ahead of the storm, and federal response teams are working on search and rescue. Biden’s trip Friday to the Gulf region will cap a difficult stretch for the president, who oversaw the chaotic exit of the US military from Afghanistan after a 20-year engagement. That included the deaths of 13 US servicemembers helping evacuate more than 120,000 Americans, Afghan allies and others fleeing life under Taliban rule. As Ida bore down on the Gulf Coast on Sunday, Biden was at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to witness the return of the remains of the 13 US servicemen and women who were killed last week in suicide bombing at Afghanistan’s airport in Kabul, where the evacuations were taking place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-president-joe-biden-to-survey-idas-storm-damage-in-louisiana-on-friday/articleshow/85846381.cms||---
---||World||US coordination with Taliban on strikes 'possible': Mark Milley||WASHINGTON: Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said on Wednesday that it's "possible" that the US will have to coordinate with the Taliban on any future counterterrorism strikes in Afghanistan against Islamic State militants or others. The Taliban, said Milley, is a "ruthless" group, and "whether or not they change remains to be seen." He added, "In war you do what you must in order to reduce risk to mission and force, not what you necessarily want to do." Speaking two days after the final US troops left Afghanistan at the close of a turbulent and deadly evacuation of more than 124,000 American citizens, Afghans and others, Milley and defence secretary Lloyd Austin told Pentagon reporters that it's hard to predict the future of the Taliban in Afghanistan. "I would not make any leaps of logic to broader issues," said Austin. Both men commanded troops in Afghanistan during the 20-year war and their comments on Wednesday largely focused on tributes to those who served, who died and who were wounded in the conflict and to those who executed the complex airlift over the past three weeks. With the US involvement in the war over and all American military out of the country, President Joe Biden is grappling with the prospects of a new relationship with the Taliban, the Islamist militant group the US toppled after the September 11, 2001, attacks in America, and that is now once again in power in Afghanistan. Biden has tasked secretary of state Antony Blinken with coordinating with international partners to hold the Taliban to their promise of safe passage for Americans and others who want to leave in the days ahead. Marine General Frank McKenzie, head of US Central Command, has described the US relationship with the Taliban during the evacuation as "very pragmatic and very businesslike," saying they helped secure the airport. But other reports from people in Afghanistan describe shootings, violence and Taliban moves to block desperate Afghans from getting through the gates. Biden in an address to the nation on Tuesday called the US airlift an "extraordinary success," though more than 100 Americans and thousands of others were left behind. And he vigorously defended his decision to end America's longest war and withdraw all US troops by an August 31 deadline. "I was not going to extend this forever war," Biden declared from the White House. "And I was not going to extend a forever exit." Biden has faced tough questions about the way the US went about leaving Afghanistan, a chaotic evacuation with spasms of violence, including a suicide bombing last week that killed 13 American service members and 169 Afghans. He is coming under heavy criticism, particularly from Republicans, for his handling of the evacuation. But he said it was inevitable that the final departure from two decades of war, first negotiated with the Taliban for May 1 by former President Donald Trump, would have been difficult, with likely violence, no matter when it was planned and conducted. "To those asking for a third decade of war in Afghanistan, I ask, 'What is the vital national interest?' Biden said. He added, "I simply do not believe that the safety and security of America is enhanced by continuing to deploy thousands of American troops and spending billions of dollars in Afghanistan." A number of Republicans - and some Democrats - have contended that the US would have been better served maintaining a small military footprint in Afghanistan. Before last week's suicide attack, the US military had not suffered a combat casualty since February 2020 - around the time the Trump administration brokered its deal with the Taliban to end the war by May of this year. Biden said breaking the Trump deal would have restarted a shooting war. He said those who favor remaining at war also fail to recognize the weight of deployment, with a scourge of PTSD, financial struggles, divorce and other problems for US troops. And Biden also pushed back against criticism that he fell short of his pledge to get all Americans out of the country ahead of the US military withdrawal. He said many of the Americans left behind are dual citizens, some with deep family roots that are complicating their ability to leave Afghanistan. Biden repeated his argument that ending the Afghanistan war was a crucial step for recalibrating American foreign policy toward growing challenges posed by China and Russia - and counterterrorism concerns that pose a more potent threat to the US. In Biden's view the war could have ended 10 years ago with the US killing of Osama bin Laden, whose al-Qaida extremist network planned and executed the 9/11 plot from an Afghanistan sanctuary. Al-Qaida has been vastly diminished, preventing it thus far from again attacking the United States. The president lamented an estimated $2 trillion of taxpayer money that was spent fighting the war. Congressional committees, whose interest in the war waned over the years, are expected to hold public hearings on what went wrong in the final months of the US withdrawal. House minority leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., on Tuesday described the Biden administration's handling of the evacuation as "probably the biggest failure in American government on a military stage in my lifetime" and promised that Republicans would press the White House for answers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-coordination-with-taliban-on-strikes-possible-mark-milley/articleshow/85846647.cms||---

Sinha was speaking at the launch of ‘SAATH’, a rural women enterprise acceleration programme, at Kashmir International Conference Complex here. Under the SAATH initiative of the Jammu and Kashmir Rural Livelihoods Mission, 11,000 new self-help groups (SHGs) will be established across J&K. SHG women entrepreneurs will be provided mentoring and handholding through intensive training and capacity building workshops for upscaling their business ventures. The LG observed that the specifically tailored platform ‘SAATH’ will be a major contributor to the socio-economic upliftment of women in rural and semi-urban areas. Apart from making business ecologies thrive in rural areas, the programme will nurture existing enterprises into sustainable, high productivity ventures through skilling, mentoring and market linkages, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/lg-admin-to-establish-11000-new-shgs-for-women-across-jammu-and-kashmir/articleshow/85846931.cms||M Saleem Pandit

A notification issued on Tuesday by Ladakh principal secretary for the department of forest, ecology and environment, Pawan Kotwal, confirmed the development. In India, eastern Ladakh is the only known breeding ground for black-necked cranes outside China. Snow leopards, meanwhile, are found in J&K, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh and their estimated population in the country is between 450-500. While the black-necked crane (Grus nicricollis) is evaluated as “near-threatened” on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, the snow leopard (Panther unica) is listed as “vulnerable”. Before the reorganization of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir into the UTs of J&K and Ladakh in August 2019, the black-necked crane and the Kashmir stag (hangul) were the state bird and animal, respectively. Since Kashmiri stags are not found in Ladakh, it was necessary to choose a new state animal and bird, the notification clarified.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jammu/snow-leopard-black-necked-crane-declared-state-animal-bird-of-ladakh/articleshow/85847120.cms||Sanjay Khajuria
---||World||New Afghan government to be announced soon, says Stanikzai||ISLAMABAD: The Taliban have said that the new government in Afghanistan will be announced in a day or two as all formalities have been completed following two weeks of consultations with all stakeholders. The group had earlier said it would announce a government after all foreign forces had completely withdrawn from Afghanistan. The last of the remaining American troops had departed late on Monday night after handing over control of Kabul’s Hamid Karzai International Airport to the Taliban. Confirming that the new government will have representation from all Afghan ethnic groups, the deputy head of the Taliban’s political office in Qatar, Sher Abbas Stanikzai, said those who had served in cabinets after the US occupation in 2001 would not be included in the upcoming setup. He was speaking after the three-day talks between Taliban leaders in the southern Afghanistan city of Kandahar ended. The talks were chaired by Taliban supreme leader Haibatullah Akhunzada and attended by his key deputies, Mullah Yaqoob, son of slain Taliban founder Mullah Muhammad Omar, and Sirajuddin Haqqani, the head of the Haqqani network. According to Taliban sources, the next government will include, besides Pashtuns, new faces, mostly young and educated people from the Tajik, Hazara, Uzbek and other ethnic groups. Without disclosing the form of government, Stanikzai said that women would have an important role in it. He did not specify whether women would be appointed to high positions such as ministers. The Taliban leader called on the international community to recognise the new Afghan government as it would be formed peacefully for the first time in 40 years. "All Afghans are united and we expect the US, EU and all countries of the world to recognise our government," Stanikzai said, adding that their members in Doha were in regular contact with envoys of foreign countries. According to Stanikzai, Kabul airport would become functional within two days, with financial support of $30 million from Doha and Ankara. He said Afghans with proper travel documents would be allowed to leave the country after the resumption of commercial flights. The Taliban leader claimed that the US would deport around 2,500 people who had fled without documents during the evacuations. The real test for the upcoming Afghan government, observers believe, would be how they handle the enormous challenges faced by the country. Over half a million Afghans have been internally displaced due to months of fighting between Taliban fighters and government forces. Government employees have not been paid salaries for months and banks are barely functional as Afghanistan has been cut off from international financial institutions after the Taliban seized control of the country. The US has frozen nearly $9.5 billion in assets belonging to Da Afghanistan Bank (the country’s central bank). Afghanistan is heavily dependent on financial support from outside as international aid had covered around 75% of the previous US-backed government’s budget. A day earlier, an Afghanistan central bank board member had urged US President Joe Biden and the IMF to release funds for the cash-starved country. With no evacuation flights, thousands of Afghans scared of Taliban rule have moved to the country’s border towns to cross into Pakistan, Iran and the Central Asian republics. "Thousands of people have gathered at Spin Boldak and Torkhan (Afghanistan’s border crossings with Pakistan) and the situation is far worse than what was seen at Kabul airport. As there are no foreign forces here, it has not been covered by the media," Afghan journalist Natiq Malikzada said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/new-afghan-government-to-be-announced-soon-says-stanikzai/articleshow/85847213.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

Addressing party functionaries of the Jammu province at Sher-e-Kashmir Bhavan here, Omar said: “This is a promise held out by the Prime Minister and the home minister, which should be kept.” The former CM further said, “National Conference will continue to fight for full statehood to Jammu and Kashmir and tagging the issue with ‘appropriate time’ is questionable, as it is the people who have to decide about it.” NC firmly believes in the Constitution and the supremacy of the Supreme Court, which is seized of the issue of (nullification of) Article 370 and (scrapping of) Article 35A, he said. The Centre had on August 5, 2019, defanged Article 370 and junked Article 35A, taking away the special status of J&K and dividing it into two Union territories of J&K and Ladakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/restore-statehood-before-assembly-polls-are-announced-omar-abdullah-to-centre/articleshow/85847419.cms||Sanjay Khajuria
---||India||Restore 'Darbar Move': JKAP protestors||JAMMU: Jammu & Kashmir Apni Party (JKAP) on Wednesday staged a protest demanding resumption of ‘Darbar Move,’ an age-old practice of shifting of government offices between the twin capital cities of Srinagar and Jammu. Led by JKAP trade union wing president Ajaz Kazmi, scores of JKAP activists assembled near the Press Club in Jammu and staged a sit-in protest. Later, the protestors tried to march towards the city centre but were intercepted by a police contingent. Some JKAP activists were also detained when they tried to take out a rally without permission. “We impress upon the government to review its decision in the best interest of the people,” Kazmi told the media. ‘Darbar Move’ was a traditional practice of shifting the civil secretariat and other government offices of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir twice a year between Srinagar and Jammu. As summer sets in, offices in Jammu close in the last week of April to reopen in Srinagar in the first week of May. Similarly, with the onset of winters, offices shut down in Srinagar in the last week of October to reopen in Jammu in the first week of November. ‘Darbar Move’ meant around 10,000 employees working in the civil secretariats would move along with truckloads of files through the 300-km long Jammu-Srinagar highway twice every year. Apart from the effort, the exercise cost the government nearly Rs 200 crore every year. Expenses were incurred on transportation and moving the staff that included travel fares and arrangements for their accommodation. In April this year, J&K Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha deferred the shift to Srinagar in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. Later in June, the LG announced that the J&K administration has completely transitioned to e-office, thereby ending the practice. Traders and transporters in Jammu resented the decision saying that the century-old practice, started by Maharaja Gulab Singh in 1872, gives a big boost to Jammu economically, besides developing a bond between the people of the two regions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/restore-darbar-move-jkap-protestors/articleshow/85847612.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

He was 92 and had been unwell for months. An ANI report quoted IGP (Kashmir range) Vijay Kumar as saying that internet services had been suspended across the Valley as part of a series of precautionary curbs. Referring to Geelani as "Kashmiri freedom fighter", Pakistan PM Imran Khan announced, "The Pakistan flag will fly at half mast and we will observe a day of official mourning." His body will be taken to his ancestral village in Sopore for burial, family sources said. Geelani's death came days after speculation of an imminent ban on both factions of the Hurriyat had led to a signboard of the Tehreek-e-Hurriyat being hurriedly removed from the annexe of his family home. In a way, it seemed to mark the passing of the Hurriyat mantle to the other faction led by Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, who remained defiant amid murmurs of a ban.

"US evacuated some 6,000 American citizens, and a total of more than 124,000 civilians. And we did it all in the midst of a pandemic and in the face of grave and growing threats," Austin said during a speech at the Pentagon at end of the military mission in Afghanistan. Austin said that he is proud of how military members have welcomed Afghan refugees to the United States. "Some of those brave Afghans will be coming to make new lives with their families in America, after careful screening & security vetting run by our interagency partners. I'm proud of the way that our military communities have welcomed them," said Austin. He said that the US has concluded the largest air evacuation of civilians in American history. "We have just concluded the largest air evacuation of civilians in American history. It was heroic. And I hope that all Americans will unite to thank our service members for their courage and compassion," he said. Austin also honours those who died over the course of the war in Afghanistan. "Our forces risked their own lives to save the lives of others, and 13 of our very best, paid the ultimate price," he said. "I want to end with a word to the force and their families: Thank you to all those who served in this war. Because you are the greatest asset that we have. You. The extraordinary men and women who volunteer to keep us all safe, and your families," he added. He also said that he will be visiting the Gulf next week. "I'll be traveling to the Gulf next week to thank our partners there who've done so much to help save and shelter Afghan civilians," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-evacuated-about-6000-american-citizens-more-than-124000-civilians-from-afghanistan-defence-secretary-lloyd-austin/articleshow/85847895.cms||---

Exulting over the "victory" of the Taliban over America, the global terror group called for launching the next stage of the "struggle, the way for which has been paved by the victory of the defiant Afghan nation". Besides Kashmir, it shortlisted the Levant, or the Mediterranean swath comprising Iraq, Syria, Jordan and Lebanon; Islamic Maghreb, or the region in northwest Africa consisting of Libya, Morocco, Algeria, Mauritania, Tunisia and Somalia; and Yemen as its priorities. "With the help of Allah, this historic victory will open the way for the Muslim masses to achieve liberation from the despotic rule of tyrants who have been imposed by the West on the Islamic world," said As-Sahab, the official media outlet of the core al-Qaida leadership in Pakistan. Kashmir figures prominently in the list of targets. The last time Kashmir was mentioned by al-Qaida was during the launch of its J&K outlet, Ansar Ghazwatul Hind, with the avowed objective of re-conquering India for Islam. The omission of Xinjiang and Chechnya, both sites of alleged atrocities on Muslims, is believed to be more political in nature. China and Russia have come out in recent months to support the Taliban. The al-Qaida core leadership remains in Pakistan with Ayman al-Zawahiri as its head, and, as the statement makes it clear, remains sensitive to the political imperatives of their hosts— the Pakistani government. The fact that al-Qaida has refrained from mentioning two regions where Muslims are reportedly being targeted is interesting. Chechens, at the receiving end of Russia's tough rule, formed the large number of IS fighters in Iraq and Syria while Muslims in Xinjiang remain an oppressed lot as per numerous reports. As the US vacated its presence in Afghanistan in the most messy way imaginable, China and Russia have banded together to not only criticise the withdrawal but also support the Taliban. That has extended to Pakistan as well, which is now in an informal grouping with China, Russia and even Turkey, as the Taliban’s benefactors. China and Russia worked together in the UNSC on Tuesday as they jointly abstained on Resolution 2593. Both countries objected to the non-inclusion of IS and ETIM (East Turkestan Islamic Movement) of the Uighurs in the resolution. Russia objected to the evacuation of Afghans, calling it "brain drain", while China wanted the US to continue to stay on in Afghanistan to complete its mission. Both countries called for the unfreezing of the Taliban’s assets by the US and multilateral financial institutions. Russia, certainly, is keen to posit the Taliban as the "enemy" of the Islamic State-Khorasan, hoping the new regime in Kabul will help deal with the latter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/qaida-cheers-afghanistan-victory-says-kashmir-next-target/articleshow/85851194.cms||Indrani Bagchi

---||India||Difficult to hold 2022 assembly polls if EVMs not freed for re-use: EC to SC||NEW DELHI: Uncertainty looms over next year's assembly elections in Punjab, UP, Goa, Uttarakhand and Manipur as the Election Commission moved the Supreme Court seeking timely release of EVMs and VVPATs used in state elections last year and this year, which are kept in safe custody in anticipation of filing of election petitions. As per the statute, EVMs are to be kept untouched and safe for 45 days from the declaration of results, which is the time limit for a defeated candidate to file an election petition challenging the results. If no election petition is filed within the period of limitation (45 days), EVMs can be released for re-use in subsequent elections. The problem faced by the EC stems from an order of the Supreme Court, which, keeping in mind the difficulties posed by the Covid pandemic, indefinitely extended the limitation period since the disease gripped the country from March last year. This means, all election results declared within 45 days of the lockdown enforced in March last year due to the pandemic, would still be open for challenge by the defeated candidates. Thus, all the EVMs deployed for assembly elections in Assam, Kerala, Delhi, Puducherry, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal could not be reused unless the SC fixed a specific time period for filing of election petitions concerning these polls. Senior advocate Vikas Singh mentioned the EC's application before a bench headed by CJI N V Ramana and sought urgent an urgent hearing while conveying the anxiety of the poll panel about the uncertainty around next year’s state elections, given the fact that about 4.5 lakh EVMs, used in the assembly polls this year and last year, remain locked. The bench agreed to list the application as early as possible. The EC, in its application filed through advocate Amit Sharma, said, “Every Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) used in an election and kept in the custody of the district election officer shall be kept untouched, under the standard protocol of security, tilt confirmation of election petition position from the high court concerned after the completion of the period for filing election petition, that is, 45 days from the declaration of the result.” “In the case of elections, where no election petitions have been filed or no other court cases are pending, after the aforesaid period of 45 days, EVMs may be used for any future election or any other purpose like movement, physical verification of EVMs. In case of any election where election petition has been filed, the following action shall be taken:- (i) If EVMs are the subject of the election petition, EVMs used at all polling stations in the constituency concerned shall continue to be kept in the safe custody of the District Election Officer, till such time the election petition is finally disposed of by the courts. (ii) If EVMs are not the subject of the election petition, an application may be moved to the court concerned for allowing EVMs concerned to be taken out of the strong room for any future election or any other purpose like movement, physical verification of EVMs etc,” the EC said. It said, “Due to the SC's April 27 order, the statutory period for filing election petitions as prescribed under the Representation of the People Act, 1951 has also been relaxed. Resultantly, all the EVMs and VVPATs belonging to the Election Commission of India that were used in recently held assembly elections are blocked and cannot be used in future/upcoming elections." The EC said for next year’s assembly elections in five states, 4.6 EVMs and 4 lakh VVPATs would be required. It said it has a stock of 1.4 lakh EVMs and one lakh VVPATs and hence would require 3.2 lakh EVMs and 3 lakh VVPATs, which were used in earlier state polls, to conduct the elections due next year. "Therefore, to meet the requirement for upcoming poll states, if EVMs remain stuck in the states/Union Territories of Assam, Kerala, NCT of Delhi, Puducherry, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal due to the April 27 order passed by this court, EVMs and VVPATs would necessarily have to be shifted from all the states/Union Territories to these five poll states leading to serious logistical challenges which may also lead to delay in First Level Checking of EVMs and VVPATs," the EC said. "The preparatory work to conduct aforesaid elections, like movement of requisite quantity of EVMs and VVPATs ought to have started in July, 2021 itself so that First Level Checking of EVMs and VVPATs, which is a mandatory process, could start from the first week of September, 2021," it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/difficult-to-hold-2022-assembly-polls-if-evms-not-freed-for-re-use-ec-to-sc/articleshow/85851351.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka CM Basavaraj Bommai’s high-speed rail link move stumps officials and experts||BENGALURU: In the thick of a financial crisis and preparations ahead of the anticipated third wave of Covid-19 infections, chief minister Basavaraj Bommai’s “sudden” announcement that the high-speed rail project (HSRP) proposed in 2008 to link the city centre with the Kempegowda International Airport will be revived has caught his entire government off guard. Officials from the urban development department (UDD), the infrastructure development department (IDD) and the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation (BMRCL) denied being consulted on the proposal and blamed one another for the revival move. CMO officials, too, claimed they have no knowledge of how Bommai came up with the idea of reviving the HSRP proposal. In 2008, the government had considered high-speed rail connectivity from MG Road to the airport. Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) submitted a detailed project report for the service that promised to cover 33 km in 25 minutes at a maximum speed of 145 kmph. The project cost was estimated to be close to Rs 6,700 crore in 2008. An SPV named Bangalore Airport Rail Link limited (BARL) was formed to take up the project but the government shifted its focus on the Metro.The proposed fare structure was Rs 200 from Cubbon Road to BIAL, Rs 150 from Hebbal to KIA and Rs 100 from Yelahanka to KIA. High-speed rail project not viable: ExpertsMultiple sources within the government and experts wondered what was the rationale behind reviving the project that was junked as a “waste of resources”. Doubts are being raised over the very requirement of HSRP. Given that there is already an expressway linking the city to KIA and two other mass transit projects — suburban rail and Namma Metro line — in the pipeline, they say where is the space to accommodate another mode of transport. Besides, there is another grander proposal — a hyperloop link to the airport on the cards. Further, the land earmarked for HSRP has now been taken for Metro alignment and any revival could only entail expenditure to the tune of hundreds of crores of rupees on land acquisition alone. “HSRP was supposed to run along the eastern side of NH-44. In fact, NHAI had earmarked space for HSRP but the same is now being used for Metro’s airport corridor. We doubt whether this project will take off since it was put in cold storage in 2013 to make way for Metro,” said an official. “With the Suburban rail and Namma Metro project to international airport cast in stone and under way, projects like the HSRP or the even more grand erstwhile proposal of a hyperloop to the airport are nothing but a wastage of resources and create even more chaos along the already dense traffic stretch,” said a senior government official. “An HSRP would just complicate the situation, create competition among government agencies and only cause additional losses to the exchequer,” another official said. BIAL records show that passenger traffic at KIA has fallen from 32.3 million in 2019-20 to 10.91 million in 2020-21, a 66% reduction, mainly due to Covid-19. Raj Kumar Dugar of Citizens 4 Citizens NGO, said HSRP will not be a viable project in terms of cost. “We really don’t need a high-cost rail to the airport when a cheaper suburban rail alternative is already available. Low-speed construction of both HSRP and Metro will further affect traffic on the airport road. It will lead to cutting down of more trees,” he said. According to E Sreedharan, India's Metro Man and former DMRC principal adviser, it’s time the government decided on a high-speed rail link from the city centre to the airport with a maximum speed of 160kmph so that journey time will be only about 20 minutes. “Such a project should be a joint venture between the state government and airport operator and can be partly funded through a travel cess on this line,” he said. Ashish Verma, IISc associate professor (transportation systems engineering), said there should be a thorough study on travel demand and cost-benefit analysis. “The government should not take an ad-hoc decision. Now, we have two mass transport plans — Metro and Suburban to the airport –– ready and the focus should be to complete it on time rather than bringing a new rail,” he said, Hyperloop still aliveThe much-hyped Hyperloop continues to be alive in the scheme of things albeit a long way from being implemented. Last year, Virgin Hyperloop and Bangalore International Airport Limited (BIAL), which operates KIA, signed a memorandum of understanding to conduct a feasibility study for a hyperloop corridor from the airport to the city. A BIAL official said: “We are not aware about any plans for a high speed rail link. The Hyperloop is at a pre-feasibility stage and will take a really long time”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bommais-high-speed-rail-link-move-stumps-officials-and-experts/articleshow/85851462.cms||Christin Mathew Philip
---||India||‘Intermeddlers have no business' in Rakesh Asthana case: Solicitor General||NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court on Wednesday sought the stand of the Centre and Delhi Police chief Rakesh Asthana on a public interest litigation challenging his appointment. A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh issued a notice on a plea filed by one Sadre Alam and listed the matter for further hearing on September 8. The court also allowed advocate Prashant Bhushan to intervene and argue in the matter on behalf of the NGO Centre for Public Interest Litigation (CPIL), which has challenged the appointment before the Supreme Court. During the hearing, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, however, opposed both the petitions, arguing that “intermeddlers” and “professional PIL petitioners” cannot be allowed to challenge the appointment of the Gujarat-cadre IPS officer as Delhi Police Commissioner. “This is not Jantar Mantar or Ramlila Maidan,” the SG contended, adding that the petitioners “have no business challenging the appointment and expressed his misgivings towards “ready-made petitioners” who follow a “systematic pattern” of criticising all government-made appointments. Interestingly, Bhushan also opposed Alam’s plea, claiming that it is a motivated petition only filed to thwart CPIL’s plea. Appearing for the NGO, Bhushan stated that Alam's petition was mala fide and a “complete copy-paste” of the plea pending before the apex court. Even as the high court allowed him to intervene, Bhushan clarified that he did not intend to argue before the court as the NGO’s plea was pending before the Supreme Court. SG Mehta also flagged the issue, arguing that Alam “seems to have copied and followed the dangerous path of Mr Bhushan (NGO’s counsel). The debutant should be stopped.” He told the court that the petitioner must be investigated. “It is very serious... It is too much for a coincidence that the same typographical error was possible,” he added even as he sought time to respond to the petition on merit and said the court has to hear the “affected officer” as well before any order is passed. B S Bagga, counsel for Alam, maintained that the plea was not a product of “copy-paste” and is a genuine petition. The high court, however, refrained from expressing any view on the matter. In his petition before the high court, Alam has sought quashing of the July 27 order issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs appointing Asthana as the Delhi Police Commissioner and also the order granting inter-cadre deputation and extension of service to him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/intermeddlers-have-no-business-in-rakesh-asthana-case-solicitor-general/articleshow/85851465.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||India||1 in 5 healthcare workers yet to receive second Covid vaccine shot||NEW DELHI: Healthcare workers and frontline workers were the very first priority groups identified when Covid vaccination started in mid-January, but more than seven months on, nearly one in five healthcare workers and over a quarter of frontline workers have not yet got their second shots, official data shows. A closer look shows widely differing coverage levels in states with Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Delhi having the lowest coverage. Nationally, just over 1.03 crore healthcare workers have got the first shot, but under 84 lakh have got the second. Among frontline workers, while 1.83 crore have got their first shot, only 1.32 crore have got the second. Almost all states have achieved over 95% coverage of the first dose in both groups, barring Punjab, Karnataka and Delhi. Among the larger states, Kerala, Haryana and Jharkhand had the best record with complete or near total coverage of first dose in both groups and over 85% coverage with the second shot. In contrast, in Tamil Nadu barely 60% of healthcare workers and 40% of frontline workers have received the second dose. "There was vaccine hesitancy and wastage in the first four months of the drive. With this, the allotment came down. Although allotments have increased, we still have a lot of backlog to clear. This can be set right only if we have on time allocation of 1 crore doses," said Tamil Nadu health secretary J Radhakrishnan. Surprisingly, Himachal Pradesh, which has been in the news for the highest overall Covid vaccination coverage in the country, had the lowest proportion of frontline workers who got the second dose, just 38% of the total 5.8 lakh registered. State health authorities said the gap between coverage of first and second dose was because of the waiting period between doses being increased. Similarly, barely 50% of frontline workers in Karnataka and 57% in Delhi have got the second shot. In some states, even the coverage of first dose was very poor among these priority groups. Punjab officials, where only 61% of healthcare workers have got their first dose, blame vaccine shortage but also claim that they don’t have full data after those in the 18-44 age group, including healthcare workers and frontline workers, started getting their doses in the private sector. In Delhi just 87% of healthcare workers have got their first dose. Officials in Karnataka, where the proportion of healthcare workers who received the first dose was just 85%, claim they have problems with duplicate entries in the Cowin database of registered HCWs making the total numbers inflated. They claim that this is because doctors who are visiting consultants in many hospitals have been registered by various hospitals and nursing students who were graduating were registered by their colleges. Rajasthan, Odisha, Gujarat and Assam have ensured high coverage of first and second dose among both priority groups. Although a smaller state, Goa too has a good record, having ensured 90% plus coverage for second shots in both groups.

The CM, who took stock of the activities of agriculture and allied departments with ministers and senior officials at his camp office on Wednesday, alleged that opposition parties are trying to create unnecessary controversy over fixing of meters. “We have taken all measures to ensure free power supply to the agriculture sector even after fixing of meters to the pumpsets. No farmer has raised any objection to the proposal after we made categorical assurance on the continuance of free supply,” he said, adding the government will remit the entire amount of consumption directly into the farmers’ accounts which would then be routed to the accounts of the discoms. He further said farmers would not be required to pay a rupee during the entire transaction. “The fixing of meters would enhance accountability and make discoms provide better services. The meters would help officials keep track of the usage and shift load to new transformers or plan alternatives as and when required,” Jagan said. He also directed officials to first study the reasons behind tripping or burning of transformers. “Find out the root cause behind failure of transformers and take corrective measures. Replacement of transformers without checking the actual reasons behind their tripping will not strengthen the system as the new one too would go the same way sooner or later,” he added. The CM also wanted agriculture officials to encourage farmers to cultivate millets and discourage cultivation of paddy in areas where there is no canal to provide water. He also asked them to encourage farmers to switch to organic mode wherever possible. “We must focus on areas where fertilizer and pesticide use is high and create awareness to reduce use of chemical fertilizers,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/free-power-supply-to-agri-will-continue-cm/articleshow/85843009.cms||Samdani MN

States like Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Jharkhand, Bihar and West Bengal with considerably large population of 60 plus years have significantly low coverage of Covid vaccination doses per 1,000 population in this age category, according to ORF's Covid vaccine tracker. ORF has analysed Covid vaccination data till August 27. Times ViewIt is well established that the elderly are the most vulnerable to Covid-19. It’s a state’s duty to take care of its senior citizens. With the prospects of a third wave looming, the laggard states must accelerate the process in order to protect them and the Centre must ensure they get the vaccines to do so.The national average of doses administered per 1,000 people aged 60 years and above was estimated at 947.13.However, Tamil Nadu gave 523.05 doses, UP administered 651.12, and West Bengal 853.48, according to the ORF tracker. All these three states have more than one crore elderly population in this age bracket.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); Maharashtra which too has 1.45 crore population aged above 60 years, administered 951.12 doses per 1,000 to such people, slightly higher than the national average. “The next wave is likely to be limited to states where overall seroprevalence, both infection as well as vaccine induced, is low. However, if the vaccine coverage of elderly population is still low, there is a huge risk of the human tragedy repeating in terms of deaths and suffering,” says Oommen C Kurian, senior fellow, health initiative at ORF.   States like Tamil Nadu and Punjab which have high proportion of elderly and low vaccination coverage may bear the brunt of the next wave, unless vaccine coverage of the elderly is accelerated, he added. According to ORF’s assessment, 61.6% of 60 plus population has received at least one dose and 31.4% has got both till August 27. With the Centre pushing states to accelerate coverage in this category and ensure they are immunised with two doses, there has been significant rise in overall vaccination recently, with states like UP and Bihar ramping up overall coverage. However, since most of the rise is in first doses, it is not clear whether the coverage has improved among elderly. Overall, more than 66.15 crore doses were administered across the country till Wednesday 9pm. Smaller states and UTs like Sikkim, Mizoram, Lakshadweep, Chandigarh and Andaman & Nicobar have wider coverage of doses of Covid vaccine per 1,000 population of 60 years and above. Full vaccination of the elderly population also assumes significance because the burden of co-morbidities is also high in this segment, making them increasingly vulnerable to not only infection but also death. While vaccines may not adequately protect against infection, vaccination – especially full immunisation with two doses – has proven effective to reduce severe disease and death due to Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/low-60-vaccination-tally-in-some-states-a-worry/articleshow/85851614.cms||Sushmi Dey

Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai said Karnataka police and the National Investigation Agency (NIA) are keeping a close watch on suspicious activity in coastal districts and adjoining forest areas of Malnad region. “I cannot discuss some issues, but we’re keeping a strict vigil,” he said, adding NIA has detained a person of interest. Bommai said he’ll discuss the issue with Union home minister Amit Shah when he visits Hubballi and Davanagere on Thursday. On alleged sleeper cells of terror organisations in neighbouring states, Bommai said Karnataka police are keeping a strict vigil and working closely with NIA. Police of Mangaluru city as well as Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts refused to comment on terrorists reportedly landing in Kerala. A Dakshina Kannada district police source said they received information that at least 13 people in three batches travelled on an illegal ferry from Sri Lanka to Tamil Nadu a fortnight ago. He said they planned to travel to Kochi by road and then to Pakistan in fishing trawlers. They may have entered coastal towns and all checkposts there are being monitored. While sources said a team is expected to return to Sri Lanka via the same route and activate sleeper cells en route, police officers wouldn’t comment about it. After the 2019 bombings in Sri Lanka, the government there took strict measures to counter terror attacks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/terror-threat-vigil-in-coast/articleshow/85852240.cms||---

Explaining the reason behind the delay in supply, Arora said, “Sputnik V uses two different adenoviruses as the viral vectors. The first shot contains adenovirus 26 (Ad26) as the viral vector, while the second contains adenovirus 5 (Ad5). Manufacturing of the second dose is a slow process because the Ad5 virus grows very slowly. Since the second dose takes time to manufacture, supplies have been delayed. First doses of the vaccine will be available only when supplies of the second shot are ramped up.” So far, only a few lakh doses of the vaccine have been available for use in India. Several private hospitals have run out of the vaccine’s first dose, a source at one facility in Pune said on Wednesday. Dr Arora said some viruses grow very slowly in controlled conditions, including adenovirus 5. “The virus has been used in the past for candidate vaccines and has posed the same issue. Sputnik V’s availability so far in India is not high enough to incorporate it in the government’s free vaccination programme,” he said. The vaccine has to be stored at -18°C for stability and potency. Apart from Russia, only India is manufacturing the vaccine, he said, adding that the manufacturing process had begun in India, but issues in ramping up second dose production were being experienced here as well as in Russia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/supply-crunch-hits-inclusion-of-sputnik-v-in-government-vaccination-drive/articleshow/85852318.cms||Neha Madaan

The gang members arrived in Mysuru few weeks ago and did recce of the area around the jewellery shops in the city they had listed to loot including the one in Vidyaranyapuram where they succeeded, but were caught, police stated. The gang and the conspirators had identified some 4-5 shops that are located away from the central business district and had displayed maximum jewelleries on showcases. Prior to the incident on August 23, the gang had made a futile attempt at another shop where the owner insisted that they leave footwear outside the shop, which led to an argument between them, the cops added. Cops are yet to arrest one of the culprits. A man seen in the footage downing the shutter before committing the offence is still on the run. An officer said business rivalry is suspected to be the motive behind the crime. A jeweller from Mysuru conspired with some people in Bengaluru and Rajasthan to loot a few shops run by people known to him in the city. “How they teamed up and grouped the men from different states is being investigated. So far, eight are booked in the case and of them seven are in police custody,” the officer added. Countrymade pistol was hid in drainInterestingly, police have recovered the pistol used in the crime at the Vidyaranyapuram jewellery shop. The accused, who shot at a youth, killing him on spot, was arrested from West Bengal, but the weapon was recovered from another accused in Mumbai. “After the crime, he handed over the pistol to another accused and he hid the weapon in a drain near his house in Mumbai. It is a country made pistol,” said a police officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/gang-planned-to-loot-more-jewellery-shops-in-mysuru/articleshow/85843687.cms||Lawrence Milton

To avail of the benefits, the head of the family needs to register on the portal rggbkmny.cg.nic.in by November 30. Prior to registration, they have to submit their application to the gram panchayat secretary with Aadhaar number, bank passbook details and an active mobile number. The gram panchayat secretary will forward it to the Janpad panchayat CEO after which the application will be updated on the portal.

The efforts of both the national parties to make the rebels retire from the fray have not met with much success. Candidates from Janata Dal(S), Aam Admi Party, Uttama Prajakeeya and other small outfits have the potential to upset the national parties’ calculations by eating into the votes of these parties. This has resulted in tough contest in some wards. For former corporators who are now seeking re-election, it has become a matter of prestige to retain the seat. The delimitation of wards and reservation has forced some of them to change their constituency while some have lost the pockets which were their vote bank. In ward 3 BJP leader Iresh Anchatageri faces his own party’s Manjunath Naddatti who has turned a rebel. Another former corporator Shankar Shelke (BJP) has to face two formidable candidates — Basavaraj Jadhav of Congress and Prakash Ghatge (Congress rebel) — in ward 8. Ghatge, who had been declared official candidate of Congress, turned a rebel after he was denied B form at eleventh hour. All the three belong to Maratha community. In ward no.14 it is a direct fight between Shambhu Salimani (Congress) and former Congress corporator Subhas Shindhe (now BJP). Shindhe, who was aspiring for Congress ticket, shifted to BJP overnight after being denied ticket by Congress and managed to be the BJP candidate. While there are 6,000 Muslim voters in the ward, Hindu voters account for 4,000. Shindhe claims to cut into Muslim votes. The contest between two Brahmin candidates — Vishnu Korlahalli (BJP) and Aniruddh Chinchore (Congress) — who are greenhorns in ward 15 that covers Brahmin-dominated Malamaddi area has caused curiosity. Builder Shridhar Panajikar of JD(S) is also in the fray. Members suspendedMeanwhile, BJP suspended former mayor Venkatesh Mestri and former corporator Mohan Asundi on charges of anti-party activities. Congress suspended former opposition leader in HDMC Yasin Haveripeth. BJP also suspended seven members in Hubballi-Dharwad Central constituency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/rebels-make-it-a-keen-contest/articleshow/85841938.cms||Gurura Jamkhandi
---||India||Women drivers to break jungle barrier||DEHRADUN: The state of Uttarakhand will deploy women as Gypsy drivers and nature guides across all tiger reserves and wildlife sanctuaries. Until now, only men were employed in these wildlife tourism activities. This comes just months after the government had announced in March that women Gypsy drivers — referred to as pilots — and nature guides would be appointed at Corbett Tiger Reserve after training them. Nearly 50 women are being trained to take up responsibilities in the two tiger reserves — Rajaji Tiger Reserve and Corbett — and six sanctuaries in the state which boast of high populations of tigers, leopards and elephants. The first batch of 21 women is currently undergoing training in Dehradun. J S Suhag, chief wildlife warden, claimed that this would be the first time that women would take up the mantle of Gypsy pilots and nature guides "in all tiger reserves and sanctuaries in a state". Notably, two tiger reserves in Madhya Pradesh — Kanha Tiger Reserve-National Park and the Pench Tiger Reserve-National Park — have women guides who accompany tourists to core areas to catch a glimpse of the big cat. But this is not across sanctuaries and does not include pilots. Uttarakhand forest minister Harak Singh Rawat said that Corbett — which has 105 nature guides, all of them male — and Rajaji reserves will be the first to get women pilots. “Women have played a crucial role in conserving forests in Uttarakhand. With these jobs, they can earn a livelihood as well as help the forest department keep an eye on protected areas,” the minister said. When TOI spoke to women trainees at the forefront of this change in the hill state, some said they would focus on promoting responsible tourism while others were excited about playing a vital part in protecting the ecology of the hills. Meenakshi Kumari, a resident of Pauri Garhwal who will soon be deployed as a Gypsy pilot in Corbett, said she would derive “immense satisfaction” from the job. “My family has long carried out conservation efforts at a local level, for me, this job would be a natural extension of that legacy,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/women-drivers-to-break-jungle-barrier/articleshow/85852706.cms||Shivani Azad
---||India||Coal scam: Bengal makes probes Centre-state issue in SC||NEW DELHI: Even as CBI and ED are both probing TMC MP Abhishek Banerjee in the coal scam case, the Mamata Banerjee government has raised a Centre-State dispute before the Supreme Court accusing the Centre and its probe agencies of violating federal structure of the country by registering cases in West Bengal despite withdrawal of general consent. Appearing for the state, senior advocate Sidharth Luthra on Wednesday sought urgent hearing on the original suit filed by the state under Article 131 of the Constitution and told a bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana, and Justices Surya Kant and A S Bopanna that even after three years of the state withdrawing general consent to CBI for registration of cases pertaining to incidents in West Bengal, the central agency continues to breach the federal structure of governance by suo motu registering cases. West Bengal said that it had withdrawn general consent in the year 2018, but even after that the CBI has registered as many as 12 cases pertaining to incidents that took place in the state. Mamata Banerjee government said that law and order and police were constitutionally put under the exclusive jurisdiction of the states and that the registration of cases by the CBI were illegal and a transgression of the constitutionally distributed powers between the Centre and the states. Among the 12 CBI cases cited by the state was the alleged multi-crore coal pilferage scam related to Eastern Coalfields Ltd mines in which, on the basis of the CBI case, the ED had registered case under Prevention of Money Laundering Act and summoned TMC MP Abhishek Banerjee and his wife Rujira. Abhishek has denied the charges. The agency has also arrested Vikas Mishra, brother of TMC youth wing leader Vinay Mishra who has allegedly left the country and renounced Indian citizenship. CBI is already litigating in the SC over the legitimacy of its FIR on the coal scam case which allegedly took place in the railway area under central government control. The West Bengal government is contesting the CBI's claim in that case. Despite this, the state decided to file a suit and said, “From the plain reading of the law, it is evident that the CBI does not have any inherent jurisdiction in any area in a state including a railway area...without the state’s consent,” it said. Other instances cited by the WB government included the CBI case against former vice-chancellor of Visva Bharati, Shantiniketan, for alleged misappropriation of money, registration of a case on complaint of Calcutta HC about forgery of its document and a cross-border cattle smuggling incident involving a BSF commandant. The state said the CBI could register cases in states, which have withdrawn general consent under Section 6 of DSPE Act, only when there is a direction to the central agency in this regard by the constitutional courts. The CBI is unconstitutionally usurping the powers vested in the state and its police by continuing to register cases in West Bengal, the Mamata Banerjee government said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/coal-scam-bengal-makes-probes-centre-state-issue-in-sc/articleshow/85853005.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Around 29 kalyana mandapams have been leased out to various institutions so far. A committee of intellectuals formed by the TTD in the past also recommended leasing unused properties for the benefit of the devotees at large. Stringent rules are in place to initiate action in such cases where lease conditions are violated which results in impacting the sentiments of devotees,” a TTD statement clarified. Meanwhile, TTD authorities rubbished reports that some officers in the temple body had colluded with the operator of a private hotel, leading to revenue loss to the tune of Rs 3 crore. “This is all baseless and false. We will initiate firm legal action against vested interests in the social media and others who launched a vicious and a motivated campaign to damage the reputation of the biggest Hindu religious institution in the world,” the statement added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ttd-defends-move-to-lease-out-kalyana-mandapams/articleshow/85843304.cms||Sandeep Raghavan
---||Kolkata||Hidco sets ball rolling for pedestrian project||Kolkata: Hidco has initiated the process to engage an agency to design and transform Street 0106 in New Town, which runs under the flyover in Action Area I and connects Axis Mall to Central Mall, into a pedestrian- and cycle-friendly urban space. Officials said the plan includes a street food plaza, recreation zones, seating, public art, tree plantation and other decorative structures on the road. The project cost has been pegged at Rs 1.1 crore and the agency will need to complete the work within four months after starting. Officials said the reason this road was selected as a proposed pedestrian-friendly zone is that not many vehicles, except those going to the malls at both ends, enter this stretch from the main arterial crossing. “The clock tower off the main arterial road also makes it an ideal setting,” said an official.  “There are many pedestrian-only streets abroad. They give pedestrians a chaos-free walking space and are also environment friendly,” officials said. Hidco also plans to develop the street in front of Eco Urban Village as a pedestrian-friendly road while NDITA plans to develop Street 25 as a pedestrian-only road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hidco-sets-ball-rolling-for-pedestrian-project/articleshow/85846170.cms||Suman Chakraborti
---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: No traces of Pulasa in Godavari this monsoon||VISAKHAPATNAM: Monsoon is well and truly here, but the state is yet to see a steady supply of the sought-after Pulasa. August, the month when fisherfolk depend on a good catch, has seen abnormally low numbers of the fish compared to last year. Experts point out that lack of conservation, overfishing and polluting are behind the steep fall in numbers. “We have hardly earned Rs 10,000 till date because there was no catch. We only got small ones weighing half-a-kilogram. Usually, we would get Rs 1 lakh by the end of August,” said V Pothuraju, a fisherman in Yanam. In fact, two kilograms of Pulasa sold for a whopping Rs 17,000 near Yanam a few days ago. In a normal year, the fish would sell for Rs 2,000 per kg. Fisheries department official said the catch two decades ago would be around 40 tonnes. Now, it has dwindled to two to four tonnes. “The statistics are not perfect as we never calculated the catch. Because it is a migratory fish, it will come for breeding in the Godavari basin in the monsoon season. When it comes from saltwater to freshwater, many changes would take place in the fish and its taste would also change,” additional director of fisheries, East Godavari, P Koteswara Rao told TOI. Fishermen also opt for a catch of Pulasa over other varieties due to the profit the fish brings. Howeverm in the absence of breeding, fisherfolk catch the fish irrespective of size, resulting in gradual depreciation of numbers. “Pulasa is tastier due to fatty acids in the fish and the fat content would be between 20-30%. There is no breeding of Pulasa in the state. Research and development should be taken up by the government. A study should be conducted, conservation and management aspects should also be taken care of,” zoology researcher P Srinivasa Rao said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/no-traces-of-pulasa-in-godavari-this-monsoon/articleshow/85843403.cms||Siva G

Expressing anger over removing the chapters on the veteran leaders, RJD chief Lalu Prasad said in a tweet: “Thirty years back I had established JP University in the name of Jayaprakash Narayan in my karmbhoomi. Now, in the same university, this ‘sanghi’ government and officials toeing its agenda are removing the ideology of JP-Lohia from the syllabus. This cannot be tolerated. Government should immediately take note.” The students of the university have also protested the change in the syllabus. Besides JP and Lohia, chapters on Ram Mohan Roy, Dayanand Saraswati and Bal Gangadhar Tilak have also been removed. When contacted, JP University vice-chancellor Faruque Ali admitted that the syllabus committee constituted by the Raj Bhavan had made the changes. He said that 10 to 20% of the coverage in the syllabus has to be given to local thinkers. “We have taken the matter in the right spirit and will add chapters on the local leaders accordingly,” he said.  Also, these changes have occurred because of the implementation of choice-based credit system, said Faruque.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/varsity-removes-jp-lohia-from-syllabus/articleshow/85846023.cms||Sheezan Nezami

In his resignation letter addressed to CM Nitish Kumar, Amardeep said he has been finding himself unable to discharge his responsibilities with self-respect. The son of former Madhepura MP Prof Ramendra Kumar Yadav ‘Ravi’, Amardeep had been heading the JD(U) media cell ever since its establishment in 2017. Sources in JD(U) said Amardeep had been finding it difficult to discharge his responsibilities ever since Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan took over as the JD(U) president, replacing RCP. He had been facing pressure from the supporters of a rival camp within the JD(U) to include their names as the admin of the party’s different WhatsApp groups. Amardeep refused to do so. Recently, Amardeep was accused of adopting partisan attitude in uploading videos related to speeches of senior party leaders to the official Twitter handle of the JD(U). When contacted, Amardeep told TOI that he has mailed his resignation letter to the party’s top leadership. “I have quit the party post, not the JD(U) membership. I am still in the JD(U),” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/jdu-state-media-cell-chief-quits-party-post/articleshow/85846210.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Business||Madras HC puts off 5-year motor insurance order till September 13||MUMBAI: The Madras high court has kept its order on compulsory five-year bumper-to-bumper insurance for new vehicles with effect from September 1, 2021 in abeyance following a petition filed by the General Insurance Council. The court has posted the case for hearing on September 13 for all interested parties. In its petition, the GI Council had sought clarification on the term ‘bumper-to-bumper’ as it was not a standard industry definition. It was not clear whether the court was referring to a package cover including both third-party and own damage. The industry also wanted clarification on the classes of vehicles for which the order would apply. “The order was issued in response to a case involving a private car. It is not clear whether the intention is to cover all vehicles or just cars,” said an industry official. The counsel for the industry body also said that there were a number of interested parties in the order, like the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India, whose views need to be taken. According to non-life industry officials, there is no reason for them to be opposing the order as it would increase the demand for comprehensive insurance. However, the challenge was in the implementation. Even now, state authorities find it a challenge to ensure that all vehicles buy the mandated third-party insurance. In its order, the Madras high court has put the onus of implementation on the state transport department. However, states have not been successful in ensuring compliance with the third-party cover. Some industry officials feel that making comprehensive insurance compulsory might not be the way out to enforce a social obligation. “It would be far simpler to declare the vehicle occupants, other than the driver, as third parties and cover them under the third-party insurance,” said an industry source. He added that this would make them eligible to make unlimited claims under the third-party cover. While this would increase the claims ratio, the premium could be adjusted so that companies do not bleed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hc-puts-off-5-yr-motor-insurance-order-till-sept-13/articleshow/85847609.cms||Mayur Shetty

---||Vijayawada||Centre urged to place Veligonda in approved projects list||Amaravati: The state government has requested the Centre to take immediate steps to amend the gazette notification of Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) to include Veligonda project in the list of approved projects. Andhra Pradesh said that in view of the joint use of storages at Nagarjunasagar and Srisailam, full control of the outlets and power houses should be kept under KRMB. Once the water is released under the direction of the Board, the state is free to use the water as per its requirements under various projects and it is not for the Board to interfere on the allocation of utilisation. Therefore, the control of the Board should end with release from the head regulators from the common reservoirs. In a letter to the Union Jal Shakti ministry, AP water resources secretary, J Syamala Rao, placed the suggestions and objections of the state government on the notification before the Centre. AP requested the Centre include all existing projects that have allocation of water by Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal, including minor irrigation utilisations, projects based on agreements concluded by erstwhile AP mentioned in schedule-I as approved projects. Ongoing projects included in para-10 in schedule-XI of AP Reorganisation Act-2014 should be also mentioned in schedule-I as approved projects, said the state government. New projects started after the formation of the states should be mentioned as unapproved projects in the schedule-I. AP had requested the Centre to amend the notification by restricting the jurisdiction of KRMB to the extent of release of water from the common reservoirs. “The jurisdiction of KRMB as mentioned in the schedule-II should be confined to major irrigation projects such as Jurala, Srisailam and Nagarjuna Sagar,” said the state government. The government also contended that Srisailam and Nagarjuna Sagar projects along with the power houses should be kept under the control of KRMB.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/centre-urged-to-place-veligonda-in-approved-projects-list/articleshow/85843165.cms||Samdani MN

Spoton is a B2B logistics company fully owned by the two PE investors, who are exiting after three years. India Equity Partners picked up the stakes of TNT India in Spoton which was later sold to the two PE firms. PR Srinivasan (PRS), managing partner at Xponentia Capital said, “After being spun off in early 2012 with revenues of less than Rs 12 crore a month, the company has been able to grow close to Rs 1,000 crore a year, due to the emphasis on technology.” Added Gautam Gode, MD, Samara Capital, “Spoton is a unique player in an otherwise legacy industry — controlled by PE funds from Day 1 and with a totally professional and best-in-class management. Delhivery has a similar provenance; that’s why we’re happy that Spoton finds its next home in this new-age player.” In the last three years, Spoton acquired RTS (a supply chain solutions business) and set up two new verticals focused on “Air express” and “non-corporate customers”. “As a consequence, net sales and EBITDA of Spoton grew at a CAGR of around 24% and 30% respectively,” said the company statement. Abhik Mitra, MD of Spoton Logistics added, “The investment performance shows the power of collaboration between well aligned investors; the Samara and Xponentia teams have a long history of shared accomplishments dating back to their days as Citigroup colleagues.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/delhivery-buys-b2b-co-spoton-logistics/articleshow/85637250.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Now, a 50-day digital fast for Jain youth; top 10 win free pilgrimage||AHMEDABAD: With gadgets serving as one of the biggest distractions for youth in the modern world, the Jain community has devised a way to break the virtual bondage. “A mobile is a good servant, but a dangerous master.” That’s the tagline of the 50-day “digital fasting” challenge that a Jain organisation has been promoting among its youth. The top 10 performers of this feat of abstinence will win a free pilgrimage tour to Shri Sammed Shikharji in Jharkhand. The challenge’s rationale is to strengthen ties within families by weakening digital distractions besides sharpening concentration sans online interruptions. The results of this 50-day challenge, which began on July 23, will be announced on September 10. Posters heralding the contest have come up outside Jain temples in the Walled City of Ahmedabad. One such was sighted outside Shantinathji Jain Derasar at Haja Patel ni Pol on Relief Road in Kalupur. The first step of the challenge does involve an online step: registration. But after signing up, participants will have to eschew all gadgets — mobiles, laptops, tablets, and phablets — for at least 12 hours a day. On observing the digital fast between 9am and 9pm, one gets 12 points. If the fast lasts from 9pm to 9am the following day, 9 points are awarded. “The aim is to bring forth the foundational values of Jainism and make them relevant to the current generation,” said Ramesh Kumar Shah, founder of jainfoundation.in, who has launched the challenge. “Overall, the competition has drawn about 2,000 registrations including 300 from Gujarat,” he added. Over the past four months, the newly set up foundation has been organising webinars on a variety of topics, including philosophy, Jain religion, rituals, devotion, education, and Jain art and architecture. The challenge is being supported by Jain groups in Ahmedabad, Bangalore, and Chennai. Pravesh Mehta, treasurer of Jain International Trade Organization (JITO), Ahmedabad, said: “It’s an amazing initiative during Paryushan, that will lead the conversation to the optimum use of gadgets. I don’t remember using a mobile phone 20 years ago. We can manage our time without it.” Jitendra Shah, former director of LD Institute of Indology, confirmed that Jain organisations in the city had agreed to promote the concept in Ahmedabad and other places in Gujarat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/now-a-50-day-digital-fast-for-jain-youth-top-10-win-free-pilgrimage/articleshow/85847043.cms||Ashish Chauhan

He added, “The light and sound show, which will be a major attraction of the park, will throw light on Sikhism and the life of Guru Gobind Singh.” Spread over an area of 10 acres near Guru Ka Bagh in Patna City, Prakash Punj has four ‘dwars’ named after Guru Gobind Singh’s sons — Ajit Singh, Fateh Singh, Jujhar Singh, and Zorawar Singh. Near the four ‘dwars’ are five circular walls called Hemkund Sahib, Paonta Sahib, Nanded Sahib, Keshgarh Sahib, and Patna Sahib. Miniature versions of all these gurdwaras have also been carved on their walls. The multi-purpose facility, which has been developed by the building construction department at an estimated cost of Rs 50 crore, also has a circular auditorium and two exhibition halls on both sides. While the former will be used to organise religious functions, the latter will consist of exhibits related to the 10 Sikh gurus. Besides, a museum has been built on the premises of Prakash Punj with a view to highlighting the life, teachings and works of Guru Gobind Singh. The general secretary of the Takhat Sri Harmandir Ji Patna Sahib Prabandhak Committee, M S Dillon, said, “Some belongings of the last Sikh Guru, including his clothes, pen and weapons, will be displayed in the museum soon.” He added, “A multi-storey Punjab Bhavan is also being constructed here.” According to sources, a 9.5 metre-high skybridge connecting the Ajit Singh Dwar, the Fateh Singh Dwar and the auditorium is expected to attract a large number of tourists as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/park-at-prakash-punj-in-city-to-highlight-life-of-10th-sikh-guru/articleshow/85843282.cms||Faryal Rumi

He added, “There will be two committees — one at the state level and the other at the district level. The former, headed by the principal secretary of the EFCC department, will take decisions on state-level issues and policy matters for promotion of ecotourism. The latter, headed by the DMs, will take up local issues and ensure proper development of the places of ecotourism in different districts.” According to the policy, the district administration will ensure the participation of the local community in the decision-making process while developing ecotourism at any location. It will also make sure that the locals get employment opportunities later. At the beginning of the meeting, the principal secretary of the EFCC department, Dipak Kumar Singh, made a presentation on the state’s ecotourism policy before the CM. He informed the latter about the ecotourism plans and the implementation strategies. Nitish said, “We have taken several steps for protection of the environment. Now, we have prepared a policy for development of ecotourism.” He, however, added, “We have to keep in mind that there is no damage to nature in the process of development of ecotourism.” Referring to the prospect of development of ecotourism near the Valmiki Tiger Reserve (VTR), Nitish said, “It is a unique place for promotion of ecotourism. A convention centre will also be constructed at the VTR so that people can organize different events there.” The CM also pointed out that development of ecotourism would not only enhance the number of tourists coming to Bihar from other places, but also increase the income of the locals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/draft-ecotourism-policy-to-get-bihar-cabinet-nod/articleshow/85843443.cms||Madan Kumar
---||Hyderabad||Rs 25 crore worth assets of Hyderabad jeweller attached||HYDERABAD: Assets worth Rs 25 crore of city-based Ghanshyamdas Gems and Jewellers’ promoters Sanjay Agarwal and family members have been attached by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in a case of smuggling gold meant for export and diverting it to domestic market. ED has attached residential villas and 54 kg of gold seized from the accused facing a case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). ED investigation follows a case registered against the accused by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), Kolkata, under the Customs Act for allegedly diverting 250 kg of gold. Their modus operandi involved completing all customs export formalities for jewellery which was then exchanged within the airport and brought back for domestic use. “The accused Sanjay Agarwal procured gold from agencies such as MMTC, State Trading Corporation etc. meant for export but diverted it in the domestic market with the active connivance of his relatives and associates,” the ED said. In March and July this year, ED had seized documents during searches in Hyderabad revealing acquisition of properties by the accused in the name of their associates. ED had earlier arrested Sanjay’s son Preet Kumar Agarwal in this case for money laundering. Non-bailable warrants were issued by a Kolkata court against Sanjay Agarwal, Radhika Agarwal, Ajay Kumar Agarwal and Avinash Soni of Ganesh Jewellers who was paid Rs20,000/month to act as a carrier. Earlier in April 2018, DRI had arrested Preet from Kolkata International Airport. “Sanjay Agarwal boarded an Indigo Airlines flight to Hyderabad but was made to de-board by DRI officials who intercepted two boxes from the airline’s domestic cargo which contained 1,194 pieces of gold bangles valued at Rs16 crore. The consignment was supposed to be carried by Preet to Dubai. Instead, Preet passed boxes to his father Sanjay waiting outside the airport. Sanjay in turn booked the consignment of gold jewellery with Indigo Airlines’ domestic cargo to transfer it from Kolkata to Hyderabad,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rs-25cr-worth-assets-of-city-jeweller-attached/articleshow/85848741.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

The CM, who took stock of the activities of agriculture and allied departments with ministers and senior officials at his camp office on Wednesday, alleged that opposition parties are trying to create unnecessary controversy over fixing of meters. “We have taken all measures to ensure free power supply to the agriculture sector even after fixing of meters to the pumpsets. No farmer has raised any objection to the proposal after we made categorical assurance on the continuance of free supply,” he said, adding the government will remit the entire amount of consumption directly into the farmers’ accounts which would then be routed to the accounts of the discoms. He further said farmers would not be required to pay a rupee during the entire transaction. “The fixing of meters would enhance accountability and make discoms provide better services. The meters would help officials keep track of the usage and shift load to new transformers or plan alternatives as and when required,” Jagan said. He also directed officials to first study the reasons behind tripping or burning of transformers. “Find out the root cause behind failure of transformers and take corrective measures. Replacement of transformers without checking the actual reasons behind their tripping will not strengthen the system as the new one too would go the same way sooner or later,” he added. The CM also wanted agriculture officials to encourage farmers to cultivate millets and discourage cultivation of paddy in areas where there is no canal to provide water. He also asked them to encourage farmers to switch to organic mode wherever possible. “We must focus on areas where fertilizer and pesticide use is high and create awareness to reduce use of chemical fertilizers,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/free-power-supply-to-agri-will-continue-cm/articleshow/85843236.cms||Samdani MN

He said in Bihar, a large number of people demand ‘usna’ (parboiled) rice. He asked the officials to work in the direction of increasing the number of rice mills to produce parboiled rice. Besides, the ‘arwa’ rice should also be prepared in sufficient quantity.

More Covid admissions, that have already doubled at several private hospitals over the last 8-10 days, would force a squeeze of non-Covid sections that are now operating at full capacity. At AMRI Hospitals, non-Covid patients have crossed 550 across three units, which is the highest since March last year. The number of surgeries, too, is the highest in the last 18 months. The hospital has 50 Covid beds, of which 32 are occupied. It was just 17 last week. “If the present rate of Covid patient growth continues, we will be faced with the compulsion of cutting down on non-Covid patients. About 80% of our non-Covid beds are occupied and a lot of them have undergone procedures deferred due to the pandemic,” said AMRI CEO Rupak Barua. Peerless Hospital has 289 non-Covid patients. The hospital had 20 Covid patients till last Sunday, but the number has jumped to 31. “If this continues, we must extend our Covid unit, which will lead to a reduction in non-Covid admissions,” said CEO Sudipta Mitra. A Covid patient died at the hospital on Tuesday. Mitra added that with Bangladesh flights about to resume, enquiries have been pouring in from patients there. “We are now making two-three admissions from Bangladesh every day. We also have a huge number of local non-Covid patients who have surgeries and procedures lined up over the next two-three weeks,” he said.An extra Covid ward will have 50 beds at Peerless, which could see an equal number of non-Covid admissions being curtailed. Medica Superspecialty Hospital is yet to see a rise in Covid patients, but expects an explosion by the month-end. “There has been a spurt in positivity rate in tests we conducted. We have 250 non-Covid patients, which may have to come down by September-end to accommodate Covid patients,” said Medica chairperson Alok Roy. There are 425 non-Covid and 12 Covid patients at RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences at present. “Other than a minor rise in the positivity rate over the last few weeks, there hasn’t been any remarkable change,” said RTIICS zonal head R Venkatesh. He added if Covid numbers rise, non-Covid beds could be reduced “following the process adopted during the first two waves”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hosps-face-cov-non-cov-bed-balance-challenge/articleshow/85845907.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

Many of these borrowers are taking a loan for the first time with lenders assessing them using analytics and other digital appraisal tools. In the case of two-wheelers, 65% of borrowers were first-time loan seekers, while it was 35% in the case of those buying consumer durables like refrigerators or washing machines on credit. For lenders, particularly non-banks, small is beautiful with the size of personal loans shrinking sharply even as volumes of these loans surge. Between FY17 and FY21, the average ticket size of personal loans shrunk 40% to Rs 1.5 lakh from Rs 2.4 lakh. Within the personal loan segment, small-ticket personal loans (STPL — below Rs 1 lakh), which are driven largely by non-banking finance companies, have grown threefold in terms of disbursements and over 11 times in volume in the period FY17 to FY21. These STPL borrowers now account for half of all the personal loan accounts in the country. Credit bureau CRIF High Mark has done a comprehensive study, titled ‘How India Lends’, capturing market trends over five years. “The credit landscape in India is ever-evolving and has witnessed changing consumer preferences, shift in demand towards smaller ticket loans, ease of access to credit, increased usage of digital platforms and entry of non–traditional lenders in the ecosystem, to name a few,” said CRIF High Mark MD & CEO Navin Chandani. While lenders are giving out small-ticket loans at a furious pace, the activity has not gained much attention because the overall loan book has not grown a lot since these advances are short-term and small-sized. The outstanding portfolio of small-ticket personal loans with lenders has increased from Rs 26,700 crore in March 2019 to Rs 39,700 crore in March 2020, growing 48% in one year. The outstanding loans grew by only 3.6% to Rs 41,200 crore in FY21. While the value of the loan portfolio has eased in FY21, in terms of the number of loans, accounts have grown 19% to nearly 2 crore. Incidentally, it is the smaller borrowers who are facing more stress in repayment. According to CRIF High Mark, the STPL loans have 8.8% of borrowers who are not able to make payments in time (31-180 days) as compared to 3.5% in the personal loan segments. According to the report, the total size of the lending market in India as of March this year stood at Rs 157 lakh crore. Of this, retail and commercial account for 49% each. Microfinance accounts for the balance 2%. Over the last five years, retail, microlending and commercial lending portfolios have witnessed an increase of 91%, 157% and 93%, respectively. Even after the second wave of Covid, personal loans have continued to grow. According to a CARE Ratings report, the growth rate of the retail/personal loans segment stood at 11.2% and was higher by 220 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point) in July this year when compared with July 2020. In absolute terms, credit outstanding has increased from Rs 25.7 lakh crore in July 2020 to Rs 28.6 lakh crore in July 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/young-first-time-borrowers-fire-up-personal-loan-market-in-india/articleshow/85847517.cms||Mayur Shetty

Additional public prosecutor (APP) Rajesh Pathak said, “Considering the performance of the juvenile at the Army recruitment rally and his good performance in Class X and Class XII examinations, principal judge Mishra, with the consent of its members, absolved him of all charges filed against him with the SC/ST police station in 2018. He said, “The judge also directed the Nalanda SP not to mention the case in the character certificate if issued by his office, after his final selection. The minor had passed both his matriculation and Class XII examinations from the Bihar School Examination Board in first division in 2018 and 2020 respectively.” APP Pathak said while absolving the minor from all charges filed against him under SC/ST Act among others, the principal judge observed that it is natural for minors to join their parents when they see them fighting with others. He said the judge also cited the Supreme Court order in Sheela Barse versus Union of India and others when it observed... “As far as a child accused of an offence punishable with imprisonment of not more than 7 years is concerned we would regard a period of three months from the date of filing the complainant or lodging of FIR as the maximum time permissible for investigation and a period of six months from filing of the chargesheet is not done, the prosecution against the child would be liable to be quashed.” Explaining the case he said a case of physical assault using lathis and iron rods, intimidation, racial abuses and those under SC/ST Act among others with SC/ST police station was lodged by one Prabha Devi against him and four others on 22.11.2018. He said the court of additional district judge-I referred the juvenile, then 17, to be tried at JJB in 2020. He said despite several reminders the investigating officer (IO) failed to submit a chargesheet against him while he submitted chargesheet against two of the four adult accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/accused-boy-clears-army-recruitment-tests-gets-acquitted-by-nalanda-jjb/articleshow/85846450.cms||Farrukh Nadim

The patient — a naval architect — had undergone treatment for Covid with his wife at a city private hospital in July after the duo tested positive on their return from Dubai. They have now recovered and have been discharged from hospital. The wife’s genome sequencing report is pending. Genome sequencing is done mostly on samples sent from government laboratories or hospitals. But in this case, the hospital took the initiative. According to sources, the man works in Saudi Arabia. The couple flew into the city via Dubai in mid-July to see the wife’s ailing mother. While both had tested negative before they flew from Dubai, they tested positive to rapid antigen tests upon arrival at the Kolkata airport. They then visited Peerless Hospital to check it again and an RT-PCR test confirmed Covid. “While the wife only had a mild infection, the husband had a moderate disease and we had to put him on medications except oxygen therapy. I had a strong hunch that the duo could be infected by the delta variant,” said internal medicine specialist Chadramouli Mukherjee. Doctors noticed a very low CT value in the couple’s RT-PCR reports. The hospital’s microbiology department was roped in for its opinion on genome sequencing of the couple’s samples. After the patients consented and the matter was pursued with the state health department, the duo’s samples were collected on July 30 and sent to National Institute of Biomedical Genomics in Kalyani. The result confirming delta on the man’s samples came on August 29. “The couple has acted responsibly. While discharging them, we reminded them to keep themselves isolated for another two weeks and maintain Covid-appropriate behaviour to make sure they didn’t infect others,” said Mukherjee. Doctors said the duo had taken both jabs of the Astrazeneca vaccine in Saudi Arabia days before their trip to India. “Despite the infection, none of them developed a severe illness since they had got both doses of a vaccine,” said microbiologist Bhaskar Narayan Chaudhuri. The second Covid wave in India is believed to have been triggered by the Delta variant. There have been cases of breakthrough infections, and in many of them, the infection had been found to have been caused by the Delta variant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/swab-sample-of-man-who-flew-in-from-dubai-tests-ve-for-delta/articleshow/85845935.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Petrol price came down to Rs104.11 per litre whereas diesel was sold at Rs94.86 per litre in Patna on Wednesday. Petrol rate has been reduced for the third time in a month and dropped by total 34 paise. Similarly, diesel rates have been reduced for the sixth time by total 84 paise since August 1, according to the executives of fuel refilling stations in Patna. However, the compressed natural gas (CNG) and piped natural gas became costlier by Rs1/kg and 50 paise per SCM (standard cubic metre) respectively. After the revised rates, the CNG was being sold at Rs62.9/kg while the PNG prices increased to Rs31.1 per SCM in the city. The high fuel and natural gas prices have cascading effect on vegetable and fruit markets and other important commodities like foodgrain, daily household items and transportation charges. The high rates of essential items have been adding burden to the low-income and middle-income group amid the Covd-19 pandemic. Manoj Jaiswal, a resident of Gulzarbagh said, “I used to spend Rs1,100 a month on petrol before the pandemic. Now I have to spend more Rs2,000. My business has already been affected due to Covid-19. Even though the restrictions have been lifted to a large extent, I am getting very few orders. To maintain the household budget, we have already listed out all the items that are not very essential.” Rashmi Sharma, a homemaker, said she never thought that life would become so burdensome as all the household daily items and cooking gas have become costlier. “What good it would be if the diesel and petrol prices declined by 10 paise per litre. The prices of other commodities have been skyrocketing,” she said. Price pressure has added to the burden on households already dealing with job cuts, salary reductions and loss of income. “High prices are upsetting our monthly budget. The government increases the petrol and diesel prices every other day since May 2020. When they reduce the rates, it takes 10-15 days to revise the prices. I am already earning less due to work from home,” said Anuj Kumar Singh, a technical analyst and the resident of Indrapuri area. A 28-year-old Priya Kumari, who lost her job earlier this year, said as the prices of all the commodities have sharply increased, traveling has also become a costly affair. “Even the autorickshaw or cab drivers often take higher charges,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/residents-rue-only-10-paise-cut-in-fuel-rates/articleshow/85843365.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Business||IMF drawing rights to boost forex by $18 billion||MUMBAI: The country’s foreign exchange reserves will be bumped up by $18 billion with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) allocating additional Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) to India. The country’s forex reserves stood at $617 billion as of August 20, buoyed by strong inflows of foreign investment. Economists expect the reserves to increase further as the RBI continues to purchase dollars. The IMF has allocated SDR of 12.6 billion, which is equivalent to $17.9 billion on August 23, 2021. The total SDR holdings of India now stands at 13.7 billion (equivalent to around $19.4 billion at the latest exchange rate) as of August 23, 2021. This increase in SDR holdings will be reflected in the foreign exchange reserves data that shall be published for the week ended August 27, 2021. IMF makes the general SDR allocation to its members in proportion to their existing quotas in the fund. The IMF board had approved a general allocation of about SDR 456 billion on August 2, 2021 (effective from August 23), of which the share of India is SDR 12.6 billion. Since the SDR is like a cheap credit line, it does not have an impact on the RBI balance sheet although it does add to the reserves.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/imf-drawing-rights-to-boost-forex-by-18bn/articleshow/85847698.cms||---
---||Business||SBI raises Rs 4,000 crore from AT1 bonds||MUMBAI: The State Bank of India (SBI) has raised Rs 4,000 crore of additional tier-1 (AT1) bonds, offering a coupon rate of 7.72%. This comes close on the heels of HDFC Bank raising $1 billion through issue of AT1 bonds in the international market. Meanwhile, Axis Bank has already tapped the international market to raise AT1 bonds. Several other public sector banks are looking at issuing the bonds — both locally and in the international market — following the good response to recent issues. According to bankers, there is fresh interest for AT1 bonds as these offer a higher rate of return and yields are very low in the debt market. Public sector bonds are seen as low-risk investments because of government ownership. SBI’s bonds received bids in excess of Rs 10,000 crore, which is nearly 10 times the base size of Rs 1,000 crore. “Based on the response, the bank has decided to accept Rs 4,000 crore at a coupon of 7.72%,” the country’s largest bank said. The returns on these bonds are higher than conventional debt instruments as AT1 is seen as an equity-like instrument since it bears some risk. SBI’s pricing is the lowest ever offered on such debt issued by any Indian bank since the implementation of Basel III capital rules in 2013, the bank said. While the bank has AAA credit rating from local credit agencies, the AT1 offering is rated AA+, which is the highest rating in the country for these instruments in view of their hybrid and high-risk nature, the bank said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sbi-raises-rs-4k-cr-from-at1-bonds/articleshow/85847816.cms||---
---||Patna||Bihar: Flood situation grim in Champaran, Gopalganj||PATNA/BAGAHA: The floodwaters of Gandak continued to cause havoc both in its upper and lower reaches falling in West Champaran, East Champaran, Gopalganj and Muzaffarpur districts. The blocks badly affected were Areraj, Kesaria, Sangrampur, Madhuban, Patahi, Banjaria, Sugauli and Adapur, reports said on Wednesday. The flood conditions in Gopalganj Sadar, Baikunthpur and Manjhagarh were particularly acute, as the Gandak water had been moving downstream from its upper reaches, reports added. On Wednesday, the water discharge through Valmikinagar barrage was 2.21 lakh cusecs in the morning, but fell to 2.06 lakh cusecs by the evening. Similarly, the water discharge through Birpur barrage across the Kosi was 1.76 lakh cusecs in the morning and 1.74 lakh cusecs in the afternoon. Among other major rivers, the Ganga was flowing 8cm above the danger level at Patna, followed by 61cm at Hathidah, 45cm at Kahalgaon and around 70cm at Farakka. Due to the intake of water from the swollen Gandak, along with other rivers flowing through north Bihar, the water level of the Ganga had been showing a rising trend from Digha at Patna to Kahalgaon in Bhagalpur. The Bagmati was flowing 1.31 metre above the danger level at Benibad and 1.46 metre above the red mark at Hayaghat. Further, the Burhi Gandak continued to cause havoc in Samastipur and Khagaria districts. There appeared to be no respite from the floodwaters in West Champaran district. As many as 90 families of Kanti Tola in Semra-Labdeha panchayat have taken shelter with their children and domestic cattle near Salikpur police checkpost under Khadda police station area in Kushinagar district of UP. On Wednesday, a relief team from Piparasi block of West Champaran provided readymade food, like 2kg chura and 1/2kg jaggery each to the displaced families.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/flood-situation-grim-in-champaran-gopalganj/articleshow/85843466.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Madurai||As schools reopen, 90% students turn up in Madurai, 75% in Trichy||Madurai/Trichy: Schools and colleges which had turned into vaccination centres and even Covid care centres (CCC) at the peak of the pandemic got back to business on Wednesday as they opened for Class IX to XII with significant attendance by students. More than 90% attendance was recorded in most schools in Madurai while Trichy recorded 75%. In Madurai, as many as 534 high and higher secondary schools catering to about 1.66 lakh students opened as against 523 in Trichy. District collectors inspected the schools along with the chief educational officers. Madurai collector Dr S Aneesh Sekhar said almost all teaching and non-teaching staff had taken at least one dose of the vaccine. “We are allowing only 20 students in a classroom and accordingly classes have been scheduled,” he said. In schools with space constraints, only 50% students from Class IX and XI are allowed to come on alternate days in batches while all students of Class X and XII are allowed to come to school. In Trichy, some private schools chose to hold physical classes only for class XII with other classes continuing online. Teachers were positioned at the entrance of schools to record body temperature, spray hand sanitiser and register the personal details of students. Instead of allowing three to four students to be seated on a bench, only two were allowed. Madurai district CEO R Swaminathan said that during the first week of reopening, teachers will go by the refresher course module to help students grasp the basics. “On the first few days, teachers have also been asked to focus on motivating students and also reiterate awareness on health and hygiene,” he added. K B Sharmila Banu, headmistress, Ponmudiyar HSS, said students were keen to return to school and all safety measures were in place. All students were screened with thermal scanners on entry and wearing masks and use of hand sanitisers were also ensured. The school held classes for Classes IX, X and XII on the first day. “We had about 70% attendance in our school but we expect for students to turn up in the next few days. This time, school reopening feels more normal for students as they are already used to following Covid-19 SOPs last year,” said Senthilnathan M, president, Private Schools Correspondents’ Confederation. Although public transport was available, parents preferred to drop their children in their personal vehicle. “Students did not display any sign of fear or hesitation in returning to the classroom. They were seen excited, our teachers tried to make them comfortable and get accustomed to regular classes,” K Balakrishnan, principal, Bharathi matriculation school in Trichy KK Nagar said. Attendance in classes X and XII was reported higher than in classes IX and XI. “We doubt the quality of online classes, so certain subjects require physical presence. I told my son to be self-conscious in maintaining personal hygiene while going to school,” K Anandraj, father of a class XII boy from Lalgudi said. “Some schools have opted to conduct classes on alternate days, that was also a reason why the attendance was poor. Overall, we find the parents and students willing to resume classroom coaching,” an official with the education department in Trichy said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/as-schools-reopen-90-students-turn-up-in-madurai-75-in-trichy/articleshow/85848756.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Patna||RJD’s ‘Taliban’ remark for RSS invites BJP’s ire||PATNA: RJD state president Jagadanand Singh has called the RSS as the country’s Taliban, inviting criticism from BJP, which called him ‘Hitler Singh’ who is completely soaked in his party’s ways. With RJD national president Lalu Prasad is expected to return to Patna, the state’s political pulse is set to gain fast tempo, observers feel. Jagadanand, addressing his party’s disaster management cell at the RJD state headquarters on Tuesday, said, “Taliban is not just a name, but a culture. People like them are also in India. The RSS is the Taliban of India.” Besides, referring to the incidents in Uttar Pradesh (UP), Madhya Pradesh (MP) and elsewhere in the country without mentioning the names of these states, Jagdanand said those associated with it (read RSS) chop the beards and beat up those who sell bangles or repair punctured tubes and tyres (all allusion to Muslims). “The kind of atmosphere and condition prevailing in the country, the situation seems to be headed towards anarchy,” he added. The state BJP sharply reacted to his statements. “His (Jagadanand’s) statement is like that of Hitler Singh,” state BJP spokesman Arvind Singh said, pointing to the infighting and power struggle going on within the RJD itself. “The RSS does social service, works for ‘samras’ (homogenous) society and believes in cultural nationalism. Its volunteers are patriots,” Arvind added. Recently, Tej Pratap Yadav, the elder son of Lalu, had called Jagadanand “Hitler.” Later, Jagadanand installed Gagan Yadav as the state president of Chhatra RJD, a post that was otherwise unofficially held by Aakash Yadav, the chum of Tej Pratap. Tej Pratap also went to Delhi and on return from there, sat in the chamber of Lalu. He even sent an aide at the party’s state headquarters to call Jagadanand for a meeting with him! The RJD’s infighting had gone as bad as that. However, on Wednesday, Jagadanand was at the centre stage. While the state BJP made no delay in pouncing on Jagadanand, the latter had also made light of the claim of the JD(U) that CM Nitish Kumar was the ‘PM material’, which was not taken charitably by the state BJP. In the situation, Jagadanand’s statement has not surprised the observers. According to them, Lalu, whose health is improving, is likely to return to Patna in the near future. Accordingly, Jagadanand has stirred up the state’s political atmosphere, besides sharply dividing the line between the BJP and RJD and also between the JD(U) and RJD, they felt. However, Tej Pratap remains an unguided missile. Responding to BJP’s anger, RJD spokesman Chitranjan Gagan said, “It’s natural. They can say anything, but who does not know the history of the RSS in the country.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rjds-taliban-remark-for-rss-invites-bjps-ire/articleshow/85845948.cms||Abhay Singh

During a virtual meeting with chief minister, Nitish Kumar, on Wednesday, environment, forest and climate change (EFCC) minister, Neeraj Kumar Singh, expressed his desire to hold a cabinet meeting at the VTR with a view to promoting ecotourism. “The EFCC department will also organise a sightseeing session for the cabinet members and other government officials,” he said. Soon after the meeting, the officials of the EFCC department began chalking out a plan for the proposed cabinet meeting at the VTR. Later, Neeraj told this reporter, “The officials concerned have been asked to visit the area, inspect the condition of guest houses, create a play zone, mark parking slots, and identify a helipad site.” Meanwhile, a 200-acre land near the VTR, which falls under the jurisdiction of the irrigation department, has been identified for setting up green resorts. Neeraj said, “There is huge potential to promote ecotourism in the state. We have, therefore, planned to develop green belts along major rivers like the Ganga, the Sone, the Gandak, and the Kosi soon.” He added, “The EFCC department has also decided to use 20% of the revenue generated through ecotourism for the welfare of the tribals in the region.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-cabinet-meeting-likely-at-vtr-in-october/articleshow/85843497.cms||VK Tripathi

For some colleges which made it mandatory for students to be fully-vaccinated, attendance was drastically low. Colleges are also holding exclusive Covid-19 vaccination camps. “In our college, we had less than 10% attendance. Out of 3,400 students from second and third years, only 269 were present in the morning shift. Similarly, out of 3,600 students in the evening shift, only 210 were present. We are allowing only those who are fully-vaccinated to enter the campus,” said Dr Davamani M Christober, principal, The American College. He said only about 10% of second and third year students across departments were fully-vaccinated while about 57% received the first dose. In Lady Doak College, only around 100 second and third year students attended classes on Wednesday as full Covid-19 vaccination was insisted upon. Meanwhile, online classes are continuing. Some other colleges are allowing students who are partially-vaccinated to come to campus. “We had 95% attendance though we had restricted the number of students. Around 60 students had also returned to the college hostel. After 35 students who were not vaccinated for Covid-19 came to the campus, a special camp was arranged to get them to take the jabs,” said Dr D Pandiaraja, principal, Thiagarajar College of Arts and Science. Dr S Vanathi, principal, Sri Meenakshi Government Arts College for Women said only 50% students were allowed to come and most of them turned up. “We have asked second and third year UG students to come on alternate days and second year PG students to come on all days. We also held a Covid-19 vaccination camp on Wednesday and 421 second year students were vaccinated. Camps will be held on Thursday and Friday as well,” she added.

---||Business||PE-VC funding dips, late-stage cos raise more||Chennai: Private equity and venture capital investments tapered in August with the heightened bullishness of July giving way to cautious optimism. Around $7.1 billion worth PE-VC investments across 112 deals were recorded in August with transactions more skewed towards funds raised by growth and late-stage tech companies, according to data from Venture Intelligence. In comparison, July saw over 126 deals worth over $9.1 billion with deal flow distributed across stages. Private equity and venture capital investments have hit record levels this year. For January-August 2021, investments stand at around $44.6 billion across over 700 deals. In August, mature companies raised large-ticket rounds as they contemplated their next steps to go public and also consolidate their position. Exits also doubled in the month in terms of value at $3.8 billion compared to around $1.7 billion last month. “From July to August, we have gone from wildly optimistic to cautiously optimistic. There is neither a steep fall nor a sharp climb in August, and across stages, we saw almost the same kind of deal count and value as July,” Arun Natarajan, founder, Venture Intelligence, said. Besides watching how the internet IPOs perform, it’s also important to get a reading on the US Fed’s signals as anything that happens in the US will likely impact the liquidity in Indian private markets,” he added. The largest deal of the month was Hinduja Global Solutions, the BPO arm of Hinduja Group, selling its healthcare services business to PE fund Barings Private Equity Asia for around $1.2 billion. Dailyhunt’s $450-million fundraise that included a secondary sale by early investors, and Unacademy’s $440-million series-H round were other large deals. Executive education firm Eruditus raised $650 million from Accel, SoftBank, and others turning a unicorn. BharatPe was another unicorn this month, raising $370 million from Tiger Global and others. The month also saw API platform Postman becoming the most valued SaaS startup in India in a $225-million fund-raise. Analysts said investment trends going forward will depend on how other lined-up internet IPOs perform in the public markets. There is still a lot of liquidity and the ecosystem has not hit its peak yet, they said. Natarajan noted that given the valuations, the market is also seeing more sellers with increasing cases of deals with secondary components.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/pe-vc-funding-dips-late-stage-cos-raise-more/articleshow/85845968.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

---||Agra||Panic among sellers in Mathura over meat, liquor ban||AGRA: UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s announcement that liquor and meat will be banned in Mathura has left sellers in the city in a state of panic. Thousands depend on these and their allied sectors for their livelihoods and, so far, there is no rehabilitation plan in place. Nor is there a roadmap for the ban. Yogi had on Monday said that those engaged in liquor and meat trade could take up selling milk instead and “revive the glory” of Mathura, considered holy in Hinduism. “I am the only earning member in my family of eight. I have two children. How do I change course suddenly?” asked Arun Thakur, who owns six liquor retail outlets in the city. “If the government wants to go ahead with this, it should come up with a rehabilitation plan for us … There are almost 1,000 of us liquor sellers and dependent families in the city.” And it’s not just sellers. “I work at a liquor store. The owner runs 22 such stores in the city and employs 50 people like me,” said Akhilesh Yadav. “The CM said we should start selling milk. But can traders switch so easily? Will the earnings be even comparable?” Mathura city has 644 liquor vends — 240 beer shops, 211 foreign liquor stores, 184 Indian liquor stores and nine model shops. “The excise department earned Rs 480 crore from liquor sales (as excise duty and licence fees) in Mathura over the last financial year,” said district excise officer Prabhat Chandra. For meat sellers in the city, many of whom don’t put up signages to remain inconspicuous, this threatens to intensify the crisis that started with the pandemic. “I make Rs 600-700 a day. I have six daughters and a wife to support. Where would I go? I don’t know how to do anything other than this. I learnt from my brothers in Delhi,” said Mohammad Shahid, a meat seller in Mathura. Another seller, Vishal Sonkar, who runs a meat shop that has been in his family for generations, said, “I employ six workers. I have 15 members in my own family. We can’t do anything else.” The allied sectors, too, will be hit. “Non-veg sells more than veg here” said Aarif Khan, owner of Taj Hotel in Mathura. “There are nearly 10,000 people in the hotel and restaurant business in the city.” The city has at least 300 hotels and restaurants, former secretary of the Hotels and Restaurants Association in Mathura (the body has been disbanded) Ankit Bansal said. “At least 50 of these eateries serve non-veg. Many will be left unemployed. The sector will be badly affected,” Bansal, now the national working member of the National Restaurant Association of India, said. Designated officer in Mathura’s food and drug administration department, Gauri Shankar, said Mathura doesn’t have a slaughterhouse. It has 45 registered meat shops. One of them has a turnover of more than Rs 12 lakh a year and the rest are small ones. Customers, meanwhile, asked how the government could determine their consumption habits. “Everyone has a right to eat by their choice. The sale of meat is restricted around temples, why ban it entirely?” asked Mohammad Afzal, a Mathura resident. Another, Mukesh Arora, added, “Many communities eat non-vegetarian food. The government should have thought it through before announcing.” Some said it would only encourage bootlegging. “These bans lead to liquor smuggling,” said Narendra Vajpayee, a Mathura resident. Another, Rajesh Kumar, added, “Even the prohibition in Gujarat was unsuccessful. The restrictions should only be around temples.” Over the past four years, the state government has imposed the same ban on seven towns of religious significance in the district — Govardhan, Baldev, Nandgaon, Radhakund, Gokul, Vrindavan and Barsana — after declaring them pilgrimage sites. “In Mathura, the ban will be in place in parts of the city. Which ones, has not been decided,” said additional chief secretary (information) Navneet Sehgal. “The roadmap for the ban is being prepared now.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/panic-among-sellers-in-mathura-over-meat-liquor-ban/articleshow/85843725.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The panel will sit for three more days in the high court premises and examine the police and witnesses. The advocates of the commission were seen questioning the investigation officer about certain alleged discrepancies in the police version of the encounter that killed four accused on December 7, days after they were picked up. They were facing charges of raping and killing Disha. When police opened fire on them they were trying to flee, police said. Surender Reddy, the IO was questioned at length by advocate Parameshwar for the commission. The four men had entry bullet injuries only in the front side of the body and NHRC guidelines were not followed while transporting the bodies from scene of offence to the government hospital for post-mortem, doctors who did the examination were not informed about NHRC guidelines, the advocate quizzed the IO. Questions were asked on the reasons why the judicial magistrate was not informed about the killing of the four accused, despite the magistrate being at 3.5km distance. Surender Reddy, the IO confirmed there were thousands of onlookers who had gathered at the scene. “But videos of inquest showed there were few onlookers and that too at a distance of 500 metres,” a source quoted a commission lawyer.

According to economics teachers, the faculty of commerce and management committee which has been constituted to implement NEP Policy 2020, has left out economics subjects, which is the basis for both commerce and management. Mangalore University vice-chancellor P S Yadapadithaya is the chairman of faculty of commerce and management committee to implement National Education Policy 2020 in the state. Ramakrishna B M, president of Mangalore University Economics Association, told TOI that there is no single subject on economics found in the commerce and management NEP draft. Currently, economics is taught in BA, BBA and BCom courses. “If economics is removed from the course, where should the economics teachers, both appointed by the government and college managements go? They will have to leave teaching and take up other work,” he said. Recently, various associations that have economics teachers in Dakshina Kannada, have submitted a memorandum to minister for higher education C N Ashwath Narayan, during his visit here, to include the subject in the upcoming NEP 2020. The associations from other universities too have urged the government to include the subject. Ramakrishna further added that a survey of economics teachers under Mangalore University was conducted recently, and a total 96 colleges participated. According to outcomes, there are about 176 economics teachers working full-time in colleges affiliated to MU. “If economics is excluded from NEP, as many as 119 teachers will lose their jobs,” he quoted the survey outcome. “When PU has an economics subject,why not in the undergraduate curriculum? It is a known fact that economics is a foundation for both commerce and management. In such a scenario, how can one keep away from the subject, and the committee has not included any economics teachers,” said an economics professor, who wished to remain anonymous. “We will introduce economics in the NEP 2020, and there is no need to panic about it. I have conveyed it to economics teachers,” said Mangalore University vice-chancellor P S Yadapadithaya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/govt-urged-to-include-economics-in-nep-2020/articleshow/85843745.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

---||Kolkata||Kolkata witnesses highest August rain deficit in a decade||KOLKATA: August ended with a rain deficit of 34% in Kolkata, the highest the city has clocked in more than a decade. Lack of enough low-pressure systems and absence of depressions are responsible for the showers slowing down last month, said weathermen. The last time Kolkata had a deficit in August was in 2018 when the city received 23% less precipitation than normal. Kolkata received 229 mm rain last month against a normal mark of 335.2 mm. Gangetic Bengal, too, recorded a deficit of 18% in August this time. In 2019, however, Kolkata ended August with a 60% surplus. August is the second wettest of the monsoon months, behind July. Normally, four low-pressure systems strike during the month with a couple of depressions occurring, too. “This August was unusually dry with just two low-pressure systems forming. The last one had formed last week near the Odisha coast but it did not have a strong enough impact. It led to intermittent drizzles but that were not enough to push the rain count up. The first low-pressure, too, was a weak one,” said Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) director G K Das. What made the month even drier is the elusive monsoon trough that continued to pass through north Bengal.  “While south Bengal had a secondary monsoon trough passing through it, the primary trough didn’t slide down to Bengal. It triggered heavy showers across north Bengal that received 49% excess rain in August,” added Das. In 2019, Kolkata received 198 mm rain between August 16 and August 18 which is 14% of the normal seasonal count (June-Sept) of 1,324.1 mm. The month had ended with a 60% surplus. “There was no such deluge last month which could wipe out the deficit,” explained Das. August 2017 had turned out to be moderately wet with a rain count of 385.9 mm, 15% above the normal mark. In 2016, the city had received 74% more than the normal count in August. In 2013, the city had received 103% more than the normal count in August. That was the wettest August in recent years. Rain happens in cycles and a wet July is usually followed by a moderate August. “But there’s no specific rule. Showers depend on the presence and activity of systems that drive rain in monsoon. Typically, the more frequently you have the systems, the better are the chances of heavy rain. But this August has been a good one,” said Das.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-witnesses-highest-aug-rain-deficit-in-a-decade/articleshow/85846340.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Mangaluru||Students set to form LGBTQIA+ community club in Manipal||Manipal: Due to the fear of being discriminated, students from the LGBTQIA+ community often try to hide their identity in front of other students and faculty members on most Indian campuses. They often end up facing passive queer-phobia. With classes likely to begin soon, in an attempt to break the stigma, and help the community, students from the Manipal Institute of Technology are all set to launch the LGBTQIA+ club. The club-kaleidoscope will work on the mental and physical well-being of the community. Adhar Sharma, a third-year engineering student, who has taken the lead to bring students together on this initiative, said, “ While the rigts of the LGBTQIA+ are being gradually being recognised around the world and in India, at Manipal we have not made strides towards recognising the community or creating an environment so that people are comfortable. The idea of the club and community is to normalise the LGBTQIA+ community, and get rid of misinformation, and bring the facts to the people. On a larger scale, it is about building a community and getting people who identify as LGBTQIA+, and help them overcome stigma, mental trauma and challenges that they face,” he said. This is being pursued by other universities in India as well. “We have spoken to professors, and many in the campus felt that it was high time that we had a club. We have received nearly 80 submissions from students willing to join the club. During our interactions, students have told us how there has not been much acceptance of the idea, and they face stigma at home, as their parents are not accepting them. There are students who have not been able to express themselves, and when we speak to them, they break down and speak about the challenges they have faced. We have a lot of students who identify within the LGBTQIA+, and we also have students who support the movement,” said Adhar. He said that they had approached the director, student affairs, MIT, Manipal, who has forwarded the request to the head of clubs at MIT. “We have been assured that we will be granted permission,” he said. MIT officials were not available for comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/students-set-to-form-lgbtqia-community-club-in-manipal/articleshow/85843844.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

The 125th birth anniversary celebrations of Prabhupada began here on Wednesday as chief minister Mamata Banerjee inaugurated the newly acquired space virtually from Panagarh. The original house is no longer there because small hutments had come up in its place, but the 150-year-old jackfruit tree that shaded the house still stands. Iskcon had been trying acquire the property for 43 years and has finally been able to rehabilitate the 16 families that had been living there for generations after maternal uncles of Prabhupada had sold the place to them in the 1920s. This 4-cottah space has been turned into a spiritual park. An imprint of Prabhupada’s footprint has been engraved on stone below the jackfruit tree that will be the centre of attraction of the spiritual park. “Prabhupada was born here on September 1, 1896. It was quite a feat acquiring 63, Tollygunj Road, which we have now converted into a peaceful spiritual space,” said vice president of Iskcon here, Radharaman Das. “As a spirited young man, he naturally turned towards the freedom movement. He was inspired by both Mahatma Gandhi and Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose,” Das said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi virtually released a commemorative coin on Prabhupada on Wednesday to celebrate the occasion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/iskcon-acquires-founders-birthplace-in-tollygunge-cm-unveils-spiritual-park/articleshow/85846413.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

---||Delhi||Sharjeel Imam speeches were divisive: Delhi Police to court||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police claimed before a city court on Wednesday that the speeches given by JNU student Sharjeel Imam at Jamia Millia Islamia and Aligarh Muslim University were “definitely divisive” and he had attempted to create complete anarchy. The submissions were made before additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat during hearing of Imam’s bail plea in the case in which he has been booked under sedition and stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act for allegedly giving inflammatory speeches at the two universities during the protests against CAA and NRC. Special public prosecutor Amit Prasad, appearing for the police, claimed that in Imam’s speech given at the Jamia university in December 2019, the people called upon to take an action were limited to one community. “The entire content of this speech primarily focuses on two three important points which is that the speech was definitely divisive. It was not a speech which was made for the general public at large. It was made for a specific community. And, he is attempting to create complete anarchy,” Prasad alleged. He further claimed that the accused was not a simple pickpocketer or small-time drug peddler whose conduct or what he uttered would not have a significance. “He has a knowledge of at least five languages with excellent oratory skills. With excellent skills where people would believe what he says. And it is with that background that we have to read these speeches,” he stated. While reading transcripts of the speeches filed in the chargesheet, Prasad alleged that Imam was somebody who has done his thesis on rioting and, therefore, has a knowledge of how a critical mass is to be brought together and what can be got done through them. “It is not necessary that at the threshold itself one needs to speak out his mind,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sharjeel-speeches-were-divisive-cops-to-court/articleshow/85848966.cms||Usha Das

Officials cited parents’ reluctance as well as early morning showers as reasons for the turnout.Government schools in GB Nagar reported 18-20% attendance while there was nearly no-show in private schools with a couple of exceptions. Since the government passed the order of reopening schools, parents’ associations in the city have been opposing the move, fearing a “possible third wave”. However, GB Nagar district education officer assured that they have taken all preparations — teachers have been fully vaccinated among other measures.Lalitha Ramakrishnan from Cambridge School in Noida Sector 27 told TOI that they will only conduct physical activities for students of primary classes from Saturday. “No classes were held today (Wednesday) for the primary section. We hope to hold classes in future,” she said. Other private schools in the city — Amity, JP, Somerville, Bal Bharti DPS among others — also witnessed low attendance.All Noida School Parents Association (ANSPA) general secretary K Arunachalam said: “They should stick to only online classes. We are also requesting the government to take back the order as Covid cases are again increasing.” ANSPA president Yatendra Kasana said 95% of the students in middle and senior schools are not attending classes since the schools reopened on August 16.GB Nagar Parents Welfare Society (GPWS) founder Manoj Kataria said almost all parents are against the move. “Threat of Covid infection is still looming large in the country. With no vaccine for children, parents are even more concerned. Around 90% of private primary schools on Wednesday could not conduct classes owing to the low turnout,” said Kataria.A similar situation was seen in Ghaziabad. The attendance was below 10% in private schools even as only 25% of them started the junior classes. President of Independent Schools’ Federation of India Subhash Jain said: “The attendance of students in higher classes (IX to XII) is just about 20%. So, we can’t expect many students from junior classes to rejoin school.”Shikha Saxena, head of Government Primary School in Noida’s Atta 2, said they had 70 out of 218 students attending classes on Wednesday. “We expect full attendance in coming days,” she said.Basic education officer (GB Nagar) DK Saxena said heavy morning showers also played spoilsport on Wednesday. “We expect better attendance in the coming days. As of now, most of the school managers are waiting for the consent of parents,” he said.He added that of the 1,646 schools in GB Nagar (both government and private), there are a total of 571 primary schools. Basic shiksha adhikari (BSA) in Ghaziabad, Brij Bhushan Choudhary said: “The heavy rainfall in the morning was the reason for low attendance, which may improve in the coming days.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/schools-reopen-for-primary-classes-but-most-parents-still-not-on-board/articleshow/85851083.cms||Meenakshi Sinha

---||Kolkata||Police reach out to accident victims’ families to help clear insurance hurdle||Kolkata: Conceived by commissioner of police Soumen Mitra and the top brass at Lalbazar, the Kolkata traffic police has launched a mass contact programme, after several complaints regarding delay in insurance claim reached the cops. Accident victims say they were unable to claim insurance due to delay in getting either police reports or for not properly documenting necessary details. According to Lalbazar sources, the department has so far identified 82 fatal accident victims, who died this year on Kolkata roads between January and April. Cops said 56 of these victims hail from Kolkata, of which cops have so far been able to meet 43 families. The rest were currently unavailable at their residences. “Till now, we have recorded around 134 deaths in fatal accidents this year. We will try and meet the kin of each victim. The local police and traffic guards will be coordinating with the kin of the deceased and ensure that they receive the insurance amount at the earliest,” said an officer. Commissioner Mitra spoke of the initiative for the first time while inaugurating the Road Safety Week on Tuesday. “We have been successful in bringing down accidents. Efforts are on to bring them down further. We will help victims get their claims quickly. The OCs of local police stations will meet the families and help them in expediting the process,” said Mitra. But the role of the police will not end by sharing the final report or handing over FIR copy and the postmortem report. “The local police will play a much bigger role by pursuing each case with insurance companies. They will also be helping the beleaguered families with all documentary help that will help them get the insurance quickly,” said Arijit Sinha, DC (Traffic). The police said that they will also play a crucial role when there is a delay in informing the insurer of the death amidst Covid related restrictions. “As a primary responsibility, it is very important to inform the insurance company about the person’s death. The insurer can be informed by a call or other online options. Our officers handling the case will speak to the family regarding this. In Covid times if the accident victim is not a city resident, we will take it up with the insurer,” explained an officer. “In order to start the process, the nominee has to submit supportive documents. The required documents vary in case of natural and accidental death. Our officers will ensure they get all their documents in place. This will also hold true if there is a vehicle insurance claim,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/police-reach-out-to-accident-victims-families-to-help-clear-insurance-hurdle/articleshow/85846465.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

In the past couple of days, four such cases have been reported to the cyber cell of the Ludhiana police in which people have lost lakhs of rupees to cons.According to the officials, the fraudsters send links for payment to people via SMSs and emails mentioning Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) in it so that they can trust it and make the payment. In charge of cyber cell-II inspector Jatinder Singh said, “We have received four such complaints in the past couple of days. In all the cases, the accused have used the name of an e-wallet application, PayU. Frauds send SMSs and emails claiming to be from the PayU e-wallet. They share links with people using this application, saying their electricity bill is pending and they can pay it using the link. The victims make payment through the link, but money is transferred to the account of fraudsters and not to PSPCL.”He added, “Some businessmen received the links, made payments in lakhs for their factories and offices and got duped. In one case, a man lost Rs 2.48 lakh to this new fraud and another complainant lost Rs 3.5 lakh. The emails and messages they receive mention the approximate amount of the pending PSPCL bill, which means that the data of the power corporation is being stolen.” The official said that the only solution to escape the fraudsters is to make payment only through the official website and mobile application of PSPCL.Inspector Jatinder said, “I would advise people to use only the official platforms to make payment. People should not fall for any SMS or email, claiming discounts on bills or cashbacks. This is another way of trapping them into frauds.” ‘Fake PSPCL webpage foxes people’Rupinder Kaur Bhatti, ADCP (crime), who also heads the cybercrime unit, said, “A fake page of PSPCL opens when a person clicks on the link shared by the fraudsters. That is why the person does not realise that he is making payment to a con platform. We have written to the PSPCL authorities and further probe is on to know who has leaked data of consumers.”Check on agents The officials said the police have got information that some agents pay online bills of residents for a fee and there were chances that consumers’ data was being sold by them. However, it is yet to be verified.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/frauds-targeting-people-making-electricity-bill-payments-online/articleshow/85843920.cms||Payal Dhawan

Out of 9,806 students registered for the CAP, 5,537 students have applied for science stream that has a total of 6,000 seats.

According to TOI sources, the girl, a Class XI student, took the extreme step after a scuffle with her elder brother. However, the exact cause will only be ascertained after the probe. The girl’s father works as a government school teacher.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/15-yr-old-girl-kills-self-in-bageshwar/articleshow/85843982.cms||---

The collision was so massive that the auto-rickshaw fell into a pit, killing three of the six passengers on the spot, said police. Besides, three persons travelling in the car also sustained injures. Police said there were six passengers on-board the auto-rickshaw, including driver Mohammed Ansaar and his 8-year-old son Taleem, when the speeding car rammed into it near a petrol pump on the Kasganj-Budaun state highway. All the six grievously injured passengers were rushed to the Budaun district hospital, where doctors proclaimed three of them dead upon arrival, said police, adding that two more travellers succumbed to their injuries during the treatment at the district hospital. The deceased were identified as Rambabu (50), Rajpal, Taleem, Ansaar and Poonan, while Rambabu’s son Munendra sustained injuries, said police. Police said the car driver, Sahil Kumar, his brother Shekhar and their mother Sangeeta also sustained injuries in the accident and their statements were yet to be recorded. The condition of the injured undergoing treatment at the district hospital was stated to be stable, said police. Station house officer of Kadarchowk police station Rajeev Sharma said, “An FIR has been registered against the car driver under sections 304a (causing death by negligence) and 279 (rash driving) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) following a complaint lodged by the victims' kin. According to locals, it was the car driver’s fault. He rammed into the auto-rickshaw while attempting to overtake. Now, our technical team will carry out an inspection of the accident spot and the vehicles before submitting their report." "The bodies will be handed over to their families after the postmortem,” added the SHO. Last Wednesday, six people travelling in an auto-rickshaw were killed and one was grievously injured when a speeding truck crashed into the auto in the Kunwargaon area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/boy-8-among-five-killed-four-injured-as-speeding-car-crashes-into-auto-rickshaw/articleshow/85843941.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

The project has secured fourth place in the CSIR Innovation Award for School Children-2021 and is the only one from the state to feature among the top 14 projects. Anusha and Rakshitha Naik, who developed this kit, said that the kit will help in saving tonnes of LPG. “My mother is particular that there is no wastage when using the gas stove. This forced me to think of measures to save gas,” Anusha said. Explaining about the project, she said, “GSK is placed on the gas burner and the vessel used for cooking is placed on it. GSK is made up of a metal frame, and has copper coils so that water can easily flow through it. This coil has two ends. One end is connected to an ordinary tap, and when the water passes through the coil, hot water can be collected in the bucket and used for bathing, as food is being cooked. The kit costs about Rs 625 to produce, and is economical, as it can save electricity bills and investment on geysers. In areas that receive heavy rain, solar heaters do not work. Our assessment showed that by running the gas for about 10 minutes, we can get about 13 litres of hot water for bathing, by using the GSK.” The school is located in a remote area in the district. The project has been developed with the help of headmaster Shekhar Shettigar and science teacher Vyshali Rao G C has been the project guide. English teacher Shrikanth Nayak and physical education teacher Premanath Tholar helped the students to gather the materials to make the GSK. Maths teachers Ramesh R and Sumalatha helped the students with mathematical calculations of the copper tubes, diameter, water flow and other parameters, and social science teacher Suresh Marakal Saibarakatte played an important role in designing and welding works. Teachers including Uday Shetty, Malini K R and Malathi, and clerk Jyothsna guided the students in the documentation of the project. “The kit has been tested practically both in the school and in my house. We are working towards obtaining a patent for the kit, and the GSK is being fine-tuned,” said Suresh Marakal Saibarakatte.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/govt-school-students-from-remote-area-develop-gas-saving-kit/articleshow/85843946.cms||---

According to cops this is the first time she tried her hand at snatching. “She had got used to a particular lifestyle. The Covid situation made it difficult for her to maintain that. That might have led to the crime,” said an officer. Police said the woman had convinced her friend, Sanjib Majhi, to snatch in the wee hours after the duo decided to make some quick money.  The victims were returning to their home on D N Ghosh Road and were close to Jatin Das Park when the incident took place. “The two accused had come riding a Scooty and stole valuables from the victim Maninder Kaur even as her husband Birendra Gupta tried raising an alarm and stopping them from fleeing. The incident was reported around 1.45 am in the wee hours of Tuesday morning from near the Khirode Ghosh Market on Hazra Road,” said an officer. Cops have recovered the stolen items comprising one costly android mobile, Aadhar Card, Metro smart card and Rs 600 cash. Cops have also seized the two-wheeler used to commit the crime. “This is the first time since Covid that we have arrested a female snatcher from south Kolkata. We have seen female snatchers before, but their modus operandi are different from what this woman had planned. It was Dey who herself had actually lunged at the woman’s valuables and fled from the spot,” said an office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/homemaker-took-to-snatching-to-maintain-lifestyle/articleshow/85846507.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

She also underwent a medico-legal test in Baghajatin State General Hospital. Police said an FIR under several penal sections, including rape, has already been registered. The university also removed the professor from all administrative posts pending inquiry by JU’s Internal Complaints Committee (ICC). “The student has alleged that her professor had entered into a relationship with her after giving her false promise of marriage. Later, he refused to marry her. Hence, we have started a case under IPC sections 417 (cheating), 376 (rape) and 506 (criminal intimidation),” said joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma. Police did not immediately give a timeframe but said the senior academic will be summoned shortly. The ICC is also expected to record the statements of the student and the professor, along with witnesses, “very soon”. On Wednesday, the student spoke to the media about her complaint, iterating that she was coaxed into entering a relationship with a promise of marriage. She said she had been in a relationship with the academic for two and a half months and is now being threatened and intimidated by him. The professor could not be reached for comments. JU students on Wednesday submitted a deputation to the vice-chancellor on the issue, demanding immediate action. JU authorities confirmed that the professor has been divested of his administrative responsibilities. University sources, however, did not specify whether any other action had been initiated. Registrar Snehamanju Basu had told TOI that the complaint has been forwarded to the ICC for detailed probe. The university, sources said, is awaiting the ICC recommendations.

All the three were arrested later in the day, following a gunfight, police said.Sunil Aggarwal ran the kitchen — which supplies food through online food delivery platforms Swiggy and Zomato — out of a rented house in the Mitra Enclave housing society.Around 12am on Wednesday, a Swiggy delivery professional arrived at the kitchen to collect his food orders — chicken biryani and poori sabzi. While he was soon handed over the biryani bowl, the order for poori-sabzi was getting delayed and that had led to an argument between him and Narayan, the main chef.Additional DCP (Greater Noida) Vishal Pandey told TOI that when the delivery professional was arguing with Narayan, Sunil arrived at the spot and an argument then ensued between the Swiggy man and him too.“In fact, some 8-10 delivery professionals had been standing at a distance on the road abutting the society and the three accused who were talking to them about getting work in the online food delivery platforms suddenly got involved in the fight. The three were drunk and one of them shot Sunil dead,” he said.The three accused have been identified as Vikas, Sunil and Devendra. Originally from Bulandshahr's Anoopshahr area, they have been staying at a rented accommodation in Swarn Nagri.Chef Narayan said that arguments with delivery professionals is a usual affair. “This person had multiple orders and he simply started arguing when the poori sabzi order got a little delayed. One person wearing plain clothes arrived at the spot from nowhere and shot Sunil and he died on the spot.”Police, however, said that the chef and the kitchen owner were also heavily drunk at the time. “When the three accused joined the fight between Sunil and the Swiggy professional, they all started hurling abuses at each other. Suddenly, Vikas took out his pistol and shot Sunil in his head,” Pandey said.Cops said that the accused fired upon a police party when signalled to stop at a barricade, to which the policemen retaliated. Vikas was shot at while the two others were caught as they tried to flee. The pistol used in the crime, two other country-made guns, and the Splendor they were riding were seized from them.Asked about the motive of the crime, DCP (Greater Noida) Abhishek Singh said that it seemed to be a drunken brawl. “We are, however, trying to ascertain the criminal history of the accused as a Munger-made pistol has been recovered from the accused. Munger pistols are used by criminals especially in eastern UP.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/three-jump-into-food-order-spat-shoot-bizman/articleshow/85851128.cms||Shikha Salaria

On most days in the last five weeks, daily tally was under 300. It was last over 400 (430) on July 20 and dropped to its lowest in recent days to 196 on August 17. BMC officials refuse to speculate if this uptick marks the onset of the third wave in the city, but additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said the BMC health machinery is on “alert”. Across the state, daily tally rose to 4,456 after three days of a decline in trends. 183 fatalities were reported in the state on Wednesday, of which four were in Mumbai. With this, total fatalities rose to 1,37,496 in the state and 15,981 in Mumbai. “Although the daily cases crossed 400, the number of corresponding tests were high at 41,929,” Kakani said. In other words, the daily test positivity rate remains under 1%. Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state’s task force on Covid-19, said the increasing trend is most possibly a result of the unlocking that began on August 15. There is a need to ensure cases don’t rise sharply as they did in the second wave which began in February-March and crossed over 11,000 in a single day. There are eight districts which have a higher positivity rate than the state's average. Of the total 44,366 new cases added to the tally in the last week of August, 70% or 30,000 are from five districts, of which four are in western Maharashtra. Pune, Osmanabad and Ahmednagar are experiencing a surge with weekly positivity rate also rising.The state’s weekly positivity rate rose to 2.58% from 2.49% in the third week of August. In Mumbai, BMC has set up jumbo facilities across the city, with plans to increase Covid beds from 21,000 at present to 30,000 if needed. Mumbai city guardian minister Aslam Shaikh said the government is monitoring the situation and there is no need for any restrictions at the moment, but citizens should continue to follow all Covid-19 related protocols especially during the festive season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-daily-covid-tally-in-city-hits-43-day-high-with-415-cases/articleshow/85849112.cms||Malathy Iyer

---||Aurangabad||Tiger from Tipeshwar spotted in Nanded dist||Aurangabad: The forest department on Wednesday informed about the presence of a tiger in the Kinwat taluka of Nanded district — around 380km from here. The big cat had made two kills within hours, including one cattle on the outskirts of the Mandwa village on Tuesday, sparking panic among the local residents. Honorary wildlife warden Atindra Katti said the tiger belongs to the Tipeshwar wildlife sanctuary in Yavatmal and must have entered the Marathwada region in pursuit of a new territory. “The tiger has been in the Kinwat taluka for around one month. We could capture the wild animal in trap cameras and spotted pugmarks and remains of its kill. While the tiger was hunting other wild animals, it was for the first time that it killed a cattle on Tuesday afternoon,” he said. The tiger moving around in Kinwat taluka is aged between three and four years. Its sex and official ID were yet to be ascertained by the forest department. Earlier, tiger T3C1, also known as Walker, had moved from the Tipeshwar wildlife sanctuary to the Gautala Autramghat wildlife sanctuary in Aurangabad district in March this year and it continues to stay here. The authorities said the increase in tiger population at the Tipeshwar wildlife sanctuary has been forcing many adults and sub-adult tigers to venture out in search of new territories. “The tiger population at the sanctuary was around five in 2005. It has increased by almost five times since then. The search of either new territory or mating partner often sees the tigers taken on on longer journeys,” Katti said. The tiger roaming around in the Kinwat taluka is expected to head towards its home in the Tipeshwar sanctuary or the Painganga wildlife sanctuary or the Kawal wildlife sanctuary in Telangana, the authorities said. Downplaying fears associated with the presence of the tiger, Katti said a set of awareness measures can avoid any potential human-wildlife conflict. “The locals should strictly avoid cattle grazing in the wild. It would ensure safety of human lives as well as of the livestock. Areas having the presence of a tiger should be avoided,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/tiger-from-tipeshwar-spotted-in-nanded-dist/articleshow/85841482.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Goa||Blowing in the wind: Climate change and its impact on Goa||PANAJI: The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) signalled a code red alert on rapid intensification of extreme weather events. In Goa, a chain of unusual occurrences has scientists asserting that the impacts of climate change are not only close, they are literally blowing in our face. From an episode of anomalous rainfall soon after the new year and hailstorms in winter, to the copious pre-monsoon rainfall and a catastrophic cyclone-fuelled deluge in July, the baffling weather series during the eventful seven months seems to confirm the IPCC’s warning. “Most of us thought that climate change would affect the Indian subcontinent and Goa in particular in a gradual fashion. But we are seeing the signals of it rattling us as early as now,” reputed meteorologist M R Ramesh Kumar, said. The quick succession of extreme weather events is viewed as an indication of the worsening climate crisis. ‘Rising frequency of cyclones alarming’“Each year brings calamities in different forms. In recent years, floods occurred in different parts of the country. Calamities such as cyclones, droughts and landslides have occurred more frequently in Goa and elsewhere,” Kumar pointed out. The year 2021 itself began on an ominous note as India meteorological department (IMD), Panaji, recorded heavier rainfall than usual in January. The anomalous rain made it one of the wettest January months in many years. But it ended as a wet and warm January as the month also had higher early morning temperatures than in last 30 years. The average monthly minimum temperature recorded was 22.6C, as compared to 21.5C in January 2010 and 21.5C in January 1996. “Compared to previous years, winter started with predominant easterly winds, which increased minimum temperature and anomalous rainfall,” Rahul M, scientist at IMD, Panaji, said. The winter was also Goa’s wettest in three decades due to heavy rainfall in February as well. Unheard-of events in winter — hail, thunderstorms and vertical cloud formations — during a five-day wet spell from February 19 surprised scientists. “Usually, winter months are driest and cloud-free, especially over Goa. Hailstones, a very unusual occurrence, form when clouds develop vertically up to 10km height above mean sea level,” Kumar, a former NIO chief scientist, said. The rain persisted during summer as Cyclone Tauktae struck around mid-May. “Though cyclones over the Arabian Sea during pre-monsoon season are not unusual, Tauktae was one of the closest to pass by Goa’s coast, causing immense devastation,” the IMD scientist said. What was being speculated as a heat wave-driven summer turned out to be a wet one. “Goa received its third-highest rainfall in 70 years and also saw a very dangerous trend,” Kumar said. In July, a 14-day bumper rainfall created still more havoc as one of the worst floods in 40 years submerged Goa. “The state recorded an average rainfall of 1,047.3mm against a normal of 471mm owing to increased rainfall activity during this period,” Rahul said. The increasing frequency of cyclones in the Arabian Sea is another worrisome trend. In 2019, the year of cyclones, eight of them — five in the Arabian Sea — ripped through the subcontinent, creating more impacts than ever before. The chain of cyclones continued in the following year as five of them — Gati and Nivar being very severe cyclones — formed in quick succession. “The frequency and rapid intensification of several cyclones could be attributed to the warming of the Indian Ocean. This is an alarming trend and an indication of future events,” Kumar warned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/blowing-in-the-wind-climate-change-and-its-impact-on-goa/articleshow/85849074.cms||Paul Fernandes
---||Dehradun||AICC spokesperson slams Modi govt over privatisation, questions logic behind move||Dehradun: Launching an attack on the central government over the ongoing attempts to privatise state-run organisations, Gourav Vallabh, All India Congress Committee spokesperson, said that letting the private sector hold major stakes in “strategic” assets is likely to have an adverse impact and deprive the marginalised sections of opportunities in the future. Addressing a press conference in Dehradun, Vallabh said, “Over the last seven years, we have seen a constant decline in all spheres of social and public life. Now, the Modi government has resorted to selling state assets... Why do you want to hand over the strategic assets of our country, which were built up in the last seven decades, to your friends?” Vallabh added, “Along with disinvestment and privatisation, the Modi government has now hit upon the idea of monetisation, which is essentially transferring assets to a handful of friends. Meanwhile, the government will hang on to a piece of paper of ownership that will only be returned after 30 to 50 years.” According to Vallabh, the three major ‘issues’ with privatisation are — the revenue of government-owned assets will not be available to the nation once it is privatised; marginalised sections will have lesser options to secure government jobs; and big private players will emerge as monopolies in strategic sectors such as power, telecom and natural gas pipeline.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/aicc-spokesperson-slams-modi-govt-over-privatisation-questions-logic-behind-move/articleshow/85844036.cms||Kautilya Singh

---||Chennai||Next vacation, trek through the cardamom estates of Meghamalai||By S PaulrajThese are the less-known tourism spots in the Western Ghats with floral and faunal diversity, good climate, better stay options and a serene and tranquil experience — Welcome to the cardamom estates of Meghamalai in Theni district. In recent years, the forest and wildlife laws have become stringent keeping tourists away from core forest areas. In such a situation, the richness of the forest and the experience of wildlife may be missed. Private estate plantations offer the experience of virgin forests with the rare and endemic flora and fauna of that area. Their remoteness, terrain, elevation, and climate make them more attractive than many of the other parts of the forest.As many of the estates in the Western Ghats are located at an elevation of 3,000ft to 4,000ft, they give a feel of a hill-station. In Meghamalai, streams, waterfalls and hills are just outside the window of the many estate rest houses. The surrounding grasslands, sholas, river courses, rocky patches and forest hamlets provide an ideal getaway for tourists.Adding a dash of adventure to scenic views, private estates in the Western Ghats also provide a variety of trekking experience. Nestled inside the forest, every pathway outside the estate is a possible trekking route. Among the estates, the cardamom ones have more diversified greenery than other plantation estates, as it needs more overhead shade than other crops.Estate tourism has two major categories - estate tourism in government-controlled entities such as tea and rubber and private estates which include tea, rubber, coffee and cardamom. Many of these private estates are in an abandoned state due to lack of proper transport facilities. Moreover, as they are surrounded by wildlife protected areas, forest laws allow them restricted plantation activities. This problem is prominent among estates in and around Meghamalai hills. As plantation activities become less economical, these estate owners are now willing to develop ecotourism in some parts of their estates. They are expecting support from the government, especially the forest department, for developing eco-tourism within the purview of the existing rules and regulations concerning forest and wildlife protection.Although the state is yet to develop a tourism policy of its own, the Tamil Nadu forest department could work with the approved eco-tourism policy. The interest of the forest department in the development of eco-tourism in private estates is yet to catch up with local forest officials, feels an estate owner in Meghamalai. There is no commitment on the part of the government on investment in this tourism sector. Second, as private tourism act as a buffer, pressure on forests for tourism activities could be reduced.Tamil Nadu with its high number of domestic and foreign tourists in the country, has an advantage when it comes tapping into the potential of such places. The state tourism minister in his recent meeting announced the government’s intention to diversify tourism potential. One of the salient points in his announcement is the plan to offer tours of estates, which could offer an unseen travel window for tourists.(The author is a former Indian forest service officer)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/next-vacation-trek-through-the-cardamom-estates-of-meghamalai/articleshow/85836216.cms||---

They got off a train at New Delhi Railway Station and boarded an auto to look for an accomodation after which the auto driver took them to his relative’s room in New Ashok Nagar. He also promised to get them a job. In the meantime, he sent her friend out to buy some stuff for the house from the market and sexually assaulted the girl. When her friend returned, the girl started crying and requested him to take her back to Bihar. The auto driver then dropped them back to the railway station and fled after asking them to keep quiet about the incident. The girl again broke down at the station and a patrol cop spotted her. He took her to the police station and enquired. An FIR was subsequently registered. The accused were tracked using the victim’s stolen phone and arrested. Cops also took help of CCTV footage in identifying the auto as the victim had stated a few digits of the auto’s registration number. Ravi also belongs to Bihar and had fled to his hometown after the incident. A team was sent there and the suspect was caught from near his house. Sajjan belongs to Delhi. Separate FIRs of rape and robbery have been filed. According to police, the second accused threatened and snatched the victim’s phone near the station. The accused have also been booked under sections of the protection of children from sexual offences (POCSO) Act as the victim is a minor. Her family has been informed and she provided counselling. She told NGO officials that she was in a relationship with her male friend and they wanted to get married. They had come to Delhi to start a new life.

The other 11 districts registered a rain deficit in the three months, with Pauri Garhwal getting the least showers at a 33% deficit. In Uttarakhand, the southwest monsoon season starts on June 1 and ends on September 30.

Currently practicing at Delhi's Karni Singh Shooting Range, Sanskar has been selected for two events, 50m Rifle 3 Position and 50m Rifle Prone Open category, at the premier event. “I had to move to Delhi, so that I could train better. Here, the facilities are top-notch and I am making the best of it,” said Sanskar while talking to TOI. Insisting that he was not under any pressure and ready to give his best shot, Sanskar said, the world championship for him is the route through which he wants to achieve his Olympic dream. “I know for sure that if I perform well in Peru, Paris won’t be far away,” he said. “Sanskar was a state level swimmer but I introduced him to shooting when I sensed his talent. With little training and lots of hard work, he is ready for the World Junior Championship. But that’s just the beginning,” said TP Havelia, president, Karate Association of UP and his uncle. Sanskar too credits his uncle for the accomplishments. “The credit for my journey from Lucknow to the World Championship goes to my mother, coaches, father and uncle,” said the city lad who is pursuing BA (Liberal Arts) from Manav Rachna University, New Delhi. “We wish to hire a coach from Germany but since the cost of training there is Rs 20 million annually, we are looking for sponsors for Sanskar,” said Shilpi Havelia, his mother. Earlier, in the trials held in Delhi from August 1 to 12, Sanskar secured second position in the 50m rifle three position. Prior to this, Sanskar won gold, silver and bronze medals in the 10m rifle event while participating in the Inter-shoot 20-20 Shooting Championships under the European Grand P Series at The Hague (Netherlands) in February 2020. “I achieved that feat with a hired rifle. Now, I have acquired a new one,” he said. The Karate Association of UP and Uttar Pradesh Rowing Association has announced an incentive of Rs 25,000 each to Sanskar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lucknow-shooter-eyes-podium-finish-at-jr-world-meet/articleshow/85849119.cms||Fazal Khan

It was on Aug 15, Pushpalatha K –who was on duty at the vaccination centre of the district hospital in Chengannur – achieved the rare feat. The 43-year-old had no complaints about the work load and said that “I would have continued vaccination if people were still in queue.” She began her duty by 9.30am and by 1pm around 400 persons were vaccinated. “There was a rush of migrant workers later at noon. I didn’t want to deny them vaccination,” she said, adding that an experienced nurse needs 30 seconds to vaccinate a person. “The syringe has to be taken and loaded with the vaccine. During this time, we should make the person relax and give necessary directions. While vaccinating we should be careful,” she added. Meanwhile, president of the union Jayasree PK said health workers from their wing have to plan, make arrangements and write up a detailed report for health department after vaccination on each day. “The work has become tiring and we badly need more manpower,” she said, adding that public health wing workers are in direct contact with people. “Due to the pandemic, our involvement in vaccination drives and related work, our major work like care for mother and child and prevention of epidemics have suffered,” she added. She said that there are 236 vacancies for public health nurses and several more in case of junior PHN that need to be filled. Meanwhile, health minister Veena George who visited the district hospital recently, congratulated Pushpalatha for her effort. She said health workers like Pushpalatha are the pride of the department. Pushpalatha who got the job through PSC test two years ago told the minister that she secured the job after struggling a lot in life.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/record-vax-feat-also-sheds-light-on-manpower-needs/articleshow/85846674.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

GST collections were also 6% lower than the revenues collected in July, when Goa earned Rs 303 crore in GST revenue. In 2019-20, Goa’s GST mop-up for August was Rs 325 crore, indicating that Goa’s revenues from GST are 12% short of pre-pandemic levels. Economic activity in the first three quarters of 2020-21 was severely affected due to the nationwide lockdown and the first wave of Covid-19.  Nationally, GST revenues for the month of August 2021 are 30% higher at Rs 1,12,020 crore than the GST revenues in the same month last year. Even as compared to the August revenues in 2019-20 of Rs 98,202 crore, there is a 14% growth in monthly GST earnings. Of the Rs 285 crore GST collected in Goa, less than half will go to the state exchequer, with the Centre earning more than 50% of the amount. The total GST earned by the state for the current financial year up to July stands at Rs 1346.6 crore. Though the GST collections remain far below normal, with the easing out of Covid-19 restrictions and a reduction in new cases, GST collection for July and August 2021 have suggested that the economy is recovering.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goas-gst-this-aug-34-more-than-prev-aug/articleshow/85849125.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Congress MLA says he suspects sale of vaccine certificates in Bandra||MUMBAI: Congress MLA from Bandra (East) Zeeshan Siddique on Thursday alleged that bogus covid vaccine certificates were being generated by the BMC’s H-East ward office. A video showed Siddique holding a copy of the certificate claiming that a doctor at the civic body’s Kherwadi vaccination centre has vaccinated her but the register shows that this woman never visited the centre. He alleged that there were several corruption complaints against the ward office, which is worrying. In the video, he said that it was very unfortunate that a 24 year old woman who never visited the centre had a certificate generated against her name. “For many months there have been complaints we have been receiving of corruption and that certificates are being sold. I spoke to the ward officer but the official did not visit the vaccination centre where the incident occurred. If the BMC is not taking it seriously then police should take cognizance of it. It seems certificates are being sold to those who are not taking the vaccine, which is very serious,” Siddique said. Assistant municipal commissioner Alka Sasane did not respond to calls. Medical health officer Dr Satish Badgire of H-East ward denied any scam and said that a data entry operator on contractual basis had brought his mother and sister for vaccination at the Jio Garden vaccination centre in the ward, but as the centre was not meant for those below 45 years, his sister was vaccinated there but her certificate was generated at the Kherwadi centre. “We investigated the matter and found the facts and the same was presented before the MLA too,” said Badgire. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani, in charge of the civic health department, said that he was not aware of the incident. “However I will inquire into it and based on the genuineness of the complaint required action would be taken,” said Kakani. BMC chief IS Chahal was not available for comment. Mumbai Mayor Kishori Pednekar said that she too wasn’t aware of the case. “In such a case, the concerned should come forward with the required proofs, based on which the further course of action can be decided,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cong-mla-says-he-suspects-sale-of-vaccine-certificates-in-bandra/articleshow/85849156.cms||Richa Pinto

Its authorities, however, passed the buck on examinees for making blunders while appearing in the online papers.Zareena Joya, who was awarded a gold medal in last year’s convocation, was stunned when she was declared absent in the MSc (Mathematics) fourth semester paper. The meritorious student was upset over the fact that despite appearing in the paper, she was marked absent and declared failed. Even many BEd students were also marked absent in the papers and failed. They required mark sheet for applying for a teachers eligibility test (TET) whose deadline is September 5. The aggrieved students told TOI that they had screenshots of their appearance in the exams. When they initially approached NU exam section authorities, they were not entertained.Joya and other students then wrote a letter to the Board of Examination and Evaluation (BOEE) director Prafulla Sable requesting him to make corrections in the mark sheet. It was only after his directives that the NU authorities took cognizance of their complaints and resolved their issues.“It’s entirely students’ fault as they don’t follow the instructions published in the manual. While appearing in the online papers, they need to be very careful. They are prohibited from taking screenshots, still they indulged in it. The exam software then locks the paper and marks them as absent,” Sable told TOI.He added that NU conducted over 10 lakh papers along with PhD Entrance Test (PET) successfully, but received only 350 complaints, that too due to students’ mistakes. “We have resolved their issues and awarded marks as per their performance. The examinees should also not receive any notifications from the social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. In such cases, the software blocks the paper. We have repeatedly made the students and teachers aware about this during our workshops, but they pay attention unfortunately.”Ex-VC came to NU’s rescueFormer VC SP Kane came to the rescue of his successor Subhash Chaudhari during the NAAC’s team visit to NU’s administrative block, as per NU officials. After the latter’s presentation to the visiting team led by M Das from Orissa, they started asking questions. Chaudhari couldn’t answer the queries and deviated those to Kane, after introducing him as his predecessor. Kane, who joined NU at the age of 23 and was NAAC coordinator in the last cycle when NU received ‘A’ grade, explained the visitors on NU’s history and its journey over the years. He also informed them on luminaries produced by the seventh oldest university over the years, including a prime minister, two Chief Justices of India, and leading politicians at central and state levels.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/in-a-shocker-over-350-nu-students-marked-absent-in-papers-failed/articleshow/85874496.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Patna||Bihar: Disproportionate assets unearthed during raid on suspended officer’s house||PATNA: The special vigilance unit (SVU) of Bihar police on Wednesday lodged a disproportionate assets case worth over Rs1 crore against executive officer of Hajipur Nagar Parishad, Anubhuti Prasad Srivastava, who had been suspended last month after the intervention of CM Nitish Kumar. The SUV sleuths searched the residential premises of Srivastava at Tilaknagar near Runkunpura in Patna and seized documents related to investments in real estate and insurance policies. Documents pertaining to purchase of one flat each in Patna and Indore in Madhya Pradesh were also seized. An officer associated with the investigation said evidence of investments in banks, fixed deposits, LIC policies and other sectors were found during the raid. Preliminary investigation revealed that Srivastava was paying Rs15 lakh as annual premium of an insurance policy. He has two bank lockers in his name. In addition, he owned two luxury cars. “Evidences of his frequent air travel and foreign tours, including that to Mauritius, have also been found,” the officer said. The SVU officer did not rule out accumulation of more assets and investments by Srivastava disproportionate to his known sources of income. Srivastava has been booked under Section 13(2) read with 13(1)(b) of Prevention of Corruption Act. Srivastava was earlier found involved in alleged embezzlement of funds worth Rs39 crore during his stint as executive officer of Bhabhua Nagar Parishad in Kaimur district. A probe conducted on the initiative of Kaimur district magistrate (DM) had also found a contractual engineer, Rahul Singh, and some other officials responsible for the funds embezzlement. Srivastava was suspended by the Urban Development and Housing Department on August 18 this year, two days after the matter was raised at the CM’s janata darbar. Nitish had asked DGP S K Singhal to look into the matter. Sources said the Kaimur DM’s report was submitted to the UDHD department in September last year. However, the matter remained under wraps for the reason best known to the authorities concerned. According to the DM’s report, altogether 504 schemes at an estimated cost of Rs39.71 crore were completed in financial years 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20 during the tenure of Srivastava, but tenders were floated for 51 schemes only. The probe report also highlighted gross irregularities in maintaining books and GST vouchers. Allegations of corrupt practices were also levelled against Srivastava when he was posted at Jagdishpur and Dumraon nagar parishads. “Srivastava’s case is the first one lodged by the SUV since January this year,” a senior SUV official said. The SUV was set up by Nitish soon after he came to power to nail the state’s corrupt bureaucrats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/disproportionate-assets-unearthed-during-raid-on-suspended-officers-house/articleshow/85846696.cms||Ramashankar

The walk has been organised to attract the attention of the state government to plight of the flood-affected farmers. The walk will end at Narsinhawadi on the fifth day. If the government fails to heed to the demands of the farmers, Shetti, with hundreds of farmers, plans to take Jal Samadhi. On Wednesday, the walk started from Prayag Chikali where several rivers join and form the Panchaganga river. The place is first to get affected almost every year due to floods. Shetti said, “We are not happy to carry out this long protest walk. The government has forced the farmers to take to the streets. It has been one-and-a-half months since the floods took place, but farmers have not been extended any kind of help from the government. Our demand is to waive the loans procured by the farmers for growing the crops. We also demand to ensure farmers get compensation as they received after the 2019 floods.” Hundreds of women joined Shetti during his walk from Prayag Chikali to Shiye. “I want to highlight the damages caused to the lives, properties and crops of villagers. I have learnt that the ex-gratia amount promised by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray during his visit after the floods has not been paid to 80% of the flood affected people. The villagers do not have money to buy food. They are deeply upset due to approach of the government,” Shetti said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/shetti-kickstarts-5-day-panchaganga-parikrama/articleshow/85841561.cms||---

Three people died in the murderous assault at Intezargunj in Warangal. “At about 3 am, we woke up to a huge noise made by a saw machine. Minutes later, our main door came apart and a group of armed men entered. They switched on all lights,” said Rubina, with tears rolling down her cheeks. Rubina, the only witness to the brutal attack and eldest daughter of Pasha, said: “The men, including my uncle Shafi, screamed and attacked my father Chand Pasha with sickles and other weapons.” “On seeing the attack, I rushed to my father’s defence. My uncle overpowered me. He then dragged me to another room and bolted it from outside,” Rubina, who is married, said. “A little later, Shafi attacked my mother Sabera, as I could hear her screams. She slumped to the ground with a thud. I was helpless as none came to our rescue. The culprits then attacked my two brothers — Sameer and Fahad — and maternal uncle Syed Khaleel,” she said. They left the murder weapons (sickles and knives) in the hall, assuming that all the victims were dead, but neighbours rushed in and shifted Sameer and Fahad, who were gasping for breath, to MGM Hospital, Rubina said, claiming her uncle killed her parents due to a grudge and financial issues. According to Rubina, her father Chand Pasha and uncle Shafi had jointly carried out their cattle and leather business after the demise of their grandfather. However, four years ago, the brothers went separate ways. Shafi ran into losses in his business and approached Chand Pasha again to take him as his partner. After several consultations, Chand Pasha agreed to the proposal on humanitarian grounds as Shafi had three daughters. A few days earlier, Shafi again started demanding a share in the business and their assets. “My parents rejected his plea. Since then, he bore a grudge against us. The quarrels increased in the past four months,”she said. “I pleaded with my uncle not to kill my parents, but all my pleas fell on deaf ears. They continued their spree, killing one after the other,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rubinas-pleas-fell-on-deaf-ears-killing-spree-continued/articleshow/85849226.cms||Shiva Kumar Pinna

A predictive modelling study prepared by Goa Medical College’s department for preventive and social medicine shows that Covid-19 cases are on the rise with the number of highrisk areas increasing. According to a report updated and submitted to the state government, GMC doctors have seen emerging Covid-19 hotspots across the state increase from 73 to 96. They predict a fresh surge in cases around Calvim, Mapusa, Zuarinagar and Margao. The records show that since August 20, more and more individuals have reported chest congestion, runny noses, fever and other symptoms associated with Covid-19. In North Goa, the top five Covid-19 hotspots are the Bambolim complex, Calvim, Tivim, Mapusa and the Mapusa industrial estate. In South Goa, the hotspots are Zuarinagar, Rachol, Curchorem, Fatorda and Aquem. The emerging hotspots where Covid-19 cases could see a jump over the next fortnight are Calangute, St Estevam, Chicalim, Agonda, Talaulim and Cumbharjua. Head of the GMC’s preventive and social medicine department Dr Jagadish A Cacodcar along with Dr Nitin Y Dhupdale and Dr Dhanya Jose prepared the report on the “emerging hotspot areas which are very highrisk, and high-risk areas that need immediate scrutiny”. The report has been prepared based on Arogya Setu analysis surveillance and call records from patients describing symptoms of Covid-19. The study, which also factors in data obtained from confirmed Covid-19 cases, probable cases who have come for testing and suspected cases, naturally shows Bambolim, where the GMC is based, as a major hotspot. At the same time, the doctors are encouraged by the decline in cases in Quepem, Assolda, Varca, Assonora and Betalbatim. These locations have seen their risk colour change from pink (very high risk) to amber (high risk). Six days ago, a house in Ponda was declared a microcontainment zone after a family of nine, including two elderly men and a dentist attached to the Loutolim PHC tested positive for Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/covid-19-hotspots-up-from-73-to-96-gmc-docs-predict-spike/articleshow/85849149.cms||Newton Sequeira

The board has also asked the KMC to reply in a week’s time about the reason for waste water entering the lake and thereby causing pollution. Since last one week, hundreds of litre of waste water is entering the iconic lake. The discharge of waste water not only leads to growth of hyacinth and foul odour, but also leads to deaths of aquatic life. The show-cause notice has been issued by regional MPCB officer Prashant Andhale. In the notice, Andhale states the directions were issued time and again to the KMC to ensure water bodies remain free from pollution. He has also cited the Bombay high court order regarding pollution of Panchaganga river and Rankala lake and asked the civic officials to follow the orders. “The KMC has been asked to arrest nullah water from Shyam Sundar Society and send it through underground drainage system. It must be treated at the sewage treatment plant (STP). Failing to implement the directions issued will invite legal action as per Water Act, Air Act and Hazardous Waste Rules,” said Andhale. The KMC used to drain out the waste water from the localities near the lake and send it to Dudhali-based STP. The MPCB officials have observed that the drainage system was not activated and the treatment plant was not functional.

The order paves the way for filling up around 2,600 vacant posts of assistant teachers in the state. The direction came as the bench of Justice Manoj Tiwari and Justice Alok Kumar Verma was hearing a bunch of petitions challenging the state government’s order that prohibits candidates having acquired the degree through distance learning from participating in the process. The petitioners have argued that the Centre, in December last year, clarified that the degrees of candidates who have completed their courses through distance learning will be considered equivalent to those acquired through regular classes and therefore, the state’s order goes against the Centre’s guidelines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/consider-candidates-with-distance-learning-degrees-for-post-of-assistant-teachers-hc/articleshow/85844122.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Dehradun||Despite heavy rains, landslides, Gartang Gali draws tourists by hundreds||Dehradun: Located at a height of 11,000 feet in Nelong Valley of Uttarkashi district, Gartang Gali, the unique wooden skywalk bridge - built by Peshawar Pathans as one of the routes for reaching Tibet from India over 150 years ago – has seen a record footfall of visitors. Having been shut for tourists since the 1962 India-China war, the bridge was reopened after a gap of almost 60 years for tourists in the third week of August. Since its opening on August 22, Gartang Gali has seen over 350 visitors in a span of just over a week. Apart from tourists of Delhi and neighbouring states, most of the visitors in the first 10 days were from the state itself. Located 90-km from Uttarkashi headquarters, the bridge is 136-metre-long and 1.8-metre-wide. The repair work was started by the Public Works Department in September 2020 and completed this July at an expense of Rs 64 lakh. The skywalk bridge is made of Sheesham wood and is supported at the base by small iron made structures. Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami told TOI, “In the first week, we received a positive response. We expect the numbers to go up further as the weather and the Covid situation improve.” For the safety of visitors and the bridge, authorities are allowing only 10 tourists at a time. A tour takes around 60 to 90 minutes and over the past 10 days around 60 to 70 visitors have enjoyed the bridge experience - located in the Gangotri National Park - each day. Uttarkashi district magistrate (DM) Mayur Dixit said, “Those visiting the bridge need to register themselves at the Bhairav Ghati outpost of the forest department." The groups allowed are strictly restricted from jumping, dancing, and the use of liquor and inflammable substances is prohibited. “The visitors are required to maintain a certain distance while moving on the bridge,” the DM added. Lawyer-turned politician Prithviraj Chauhan, who visited Gartang Gali bridge on August 30, said he was completely “mesmerised by the breathtaking view.” He added, “It is beautiful and the picturesque site will draw the attention of many. I am confident that the bridge will become a major tourist destination."

The government has also asked potential beneficiaries to get their second dose. The gap between two doses of the Covishield vaccine is otherwise 12-16 weeks. Nodal officer for immunisation, Dr Anup Netravalkar, said that henceforth, the 12-16 weeks rule won’t apply to these categories, and said that they will be eligible for the shot in six weeks. Netravalkar said that most teaching and non-teaching staff have been vaccinated with the first dose. However, those who are yet to take their first dose and those who are yet to take the second and a month-and-a-half has lapsed since their first dose, should not delay. “Vaccination will be held for all teaching and non-teaching staff on September 5, teachers’ day,” Netravalkar said. Meanwhile, the state has also thrown open the vaccination drive to foreign nationals living in Goa, who will have to present their passport to receive the vaccine. Netravalkar said that foreign nationals in the state can either walk in to any vaccination centre or book their slot on the Co-Win portal. Even foreign citizens who wish to take their second dose (with the first dose taken elsewhere) will be able to do so. However, if it’s Covaxin, the foreigner would have to approach a private hospital. Meanwhile, after 228 days of continuous vaccination, the state government has declared two days off for staff deployed at vaccination centres for Ganesh Chaturthi. “No vaccination will be held on September 10 and 11, and the drive will resume on September 12,” he said. Immunisation officer Dr Rajendra Borkar said that vaccination staff have done a commendable job as they all worked tirelessly for 228 days since January 16. “The vaccination continued even during heavy rains and storms,” he said. To date, he said, 15,63,726 doses have been administered. Around 11.5 lakh people have been vaccinated with the first dose, and 35% of the population has been fully vaccinated, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-reduces-vax-dose-for-edu-staff-to-six-weeks/articleshow/85849166.cms||---
---||Bareilly||UP BJP worker's missing girl, 13, found pregnant in colleague's custody||BAREILLY: For eight months, an agonised father, a local BJP leader from UP’s Sambhal, had been staging a protest outside the office of the senior superintendent of police (SSP) in Moradabad, demanding police search for his 13-year-old daughter who had gone missing. On Tuesday, police rescued the child, now seven months pregnant, from Moradabad where she had been held captive allegedly by another local BJP worker that the family was acquainted with. The accused, Vishnu Sharma, a BJP booth president in his late twenties, kept shifting base to evade arrest, said police. The girl, a student of class 8, was reunited with her family while Sharma was arrested. The girl was living at her grandparents’ house when she went missing in January. Her father suspected that Sharma had something to do with it since he had gone into hiding soon after the incident. He had earlier told TOI that he had named Sharma in his complaint, but cops were “taking too long to act against him”. In July, the Moradabad SSP formed five teams to search for the girl and the case was handed to the Sambhal crime branch to speed up the investigation process. Circle officer (Civil Lines), Moradabad, Indu Siddhartha said the girl was sent for medical examination which revealed that she was seven months pregnant. “In her statement to the court, she said that she was held captive by Sharma,” said the CO. The accused, meanwhile, said that he was “married” to the girl and he believed her to be 21. He has been booked under section 366 (kidnapping, abducting or inducing woman to compel her marriage), 376 (punishment for rape) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant provisions of the Pocso (prevention of children from sexual offences) Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/missing-for-8-months-daughter-13-of-up-bjp-worker-found-pregnant-in-colleagues-custody/articleshow/85844142.cms||Maria Khan
---||Delhi||State cannot restrict the right to life on mere anticipation, says court||New Delhi: A court has set aside a lookout circular (LOC) issued against a man in a money laundering case related to a bank loan fraud of over Rs 14,000 crore, saying the state’s interference with the fundamental rights of citizens cannot be based on mere “propitious anticipations”. Suresh Nandlal Rohira, who has been questioned in the case involving Gujarat-based Sterling Biotech Ltd, has moved the court seeking directions to Enforcement Directorate (ED) to revoke the LOC issued in July 2019 and allow him to travel abroad to join a job at a company based in Singapore. Additional sessions judge Dharmender Rana said Rohira had a fundamental right to travel abroad for earning his livelihood guaranteed under Constitution of India. The court further said ED had failed to cite any plausible explanation as to how Rohira taking a job abroad would be prejudicial to the economic interest of the country. “It is simply averred that... his presence is necessary in India for further leads in the investigation of layering of proceeds of crime across multiple jurisdiction in Nigeria. In my considered opinion, when the state attempts to curtail the right of life and liberty of an individual, the state action must be necessarily an exercise of utmost responsibility and restraint,” the judge said. The investigation has been pending since 2017 and Rohira has been extensively examined by ED on multiple occasions, the court noted. “Till date, nothing incriminating has been reported against the applicant,” it said. Rohira has neither been arraigned as an accused nor he is reported to be evading his arrest/appearance; rather he has always responded to the summons issued by ED, the court added. “Except for bare allegations, nothing credible has been brought to my notice by ED to support the contention that the applicant is deliberately concealing any vital piece of evidence. Furthermore, the applicant voluntarily undertook before this court that he shall continue to appear and cooperate, as and when summoned by ED. Instead of accepting the voluntary undertaking... ED is contesting the petition... on vague and general grounds,” the judge noted. The court directed Rohira to present himself at the Indian embassy in Singapore/Ivory Coast at least once every month during his stay. It said he should file an undertaking before the court, duly supported with an undertaking by his wife, to the effect that he would appear before ED upon being issued one month’s advance notice. It also directed that his wife and children should not leave the country without the court’s permission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/state-cannot-restrict-the-right-to-life-on-mere-anticipation-says-court/articleshow/85849237.cms||Usha Das
---||Dehradun||SC/ST students haven’t received scholarships for last four years, private institutions not offering them admissions, alleges PIL||Nainital: A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) has been filed in the Uttarakhand high court (HC) arguing that the state government has not released money for the scholarship of the SC/ST community for the last four years. As a consequence, several private institutions are refusing admission to students from socially backward classes. The division bench of Justice Manoj Tiwari and Justice Alok Kumar Verma was informed by the state government’s counsel that he is yet to receive any instructions from the government on the issue. Following this, the court listed the case for further hearing on Friday. The PIL, filed by a Haridwar-based organisation 'Dalit Muslim Pichhda Varg Ekta Samiti', alleges that the Centre had started this scheme in 2010 intending to help the socially backward students gain education post-school. However, the state government has not reimbursed the private institutions that are offering technical education to these students since 2017 and that’s why many of them have stopped giving admissions to the poor students. “The inaction on the part of the state government and also the act of discontinuance of the scheme is arbitrary and whimsical. It is also pertinent to mention that the central government has never discontinued the scheme. However, it was the state government that has not submitted its account details of disbursement to the central government for its previous years nor it has claimed the scholarship amount for ensuing years well within time due to which hundreds of students of eligible classes were deprived of the same,” read the petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/sc/st-students-havent-received-scholarships-for-last-four-years-private-institutions-not-offering-them-admissions-alleges-pil/articleshow/85844153.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat’s GST collection jumps 25% on low-base effect||AHMEDABAD: The gross Goods and Services Tax (GST) collection grew 25% in Gujarat in August this year, as compared to the same month last year.  According to data released by Union ministry of finance, GST collection in Gujarat stood at Rs 7,556 crore in August 2021 – up 25% against Rs 6,030 crore in August 2020. Against July’s collection of Rs 7,629 crore, the tax collection fell marginally by 0.9% in August. The growth in GST collection in Gujarat, is however less than the pan-India growth of 30% during the same period. Industry sources attribute the growth in tax collection to a surge in economic and commercial activity, revival in domestic demand as well as export orders. “The demand in the global market has surged many folds in various industrial sectors including textiles, yarn, steel, chemicals and pharmaceuticals. In all these sectors, domestic demand is also reviving well.  Moreover, with restrictions easing across most parts of the country and the festive season, the overall demand has bounced back well with malls, stores, restaurants and other services opening up. All these factors contribute to a robust tax collection,” said Chintan Thaker, chairman, Assocham Gujarat state council. Industry players have also attributed part of the surge in GST collection to the inflation. “Raw material prices have shot up and so have those of finished products. Inflation has also partly contributed to the surge in tax collection,” Thaker added. The 25% growth in tax collection against August 2020 is primarily due to a low-base effect. “Last year in August, the market had barely begun to recover with economic activities resuming, albeit at a slower pace. The tax collection was therefore lower than normal and therefore, on a lower base, the 25% growth rate was reported,” said a well-placed source. The gross GST revenue collected from across the country in August 2021 stood at Rs 1.12 lakh crore, of which Rs 20,522 crore came from central GST (CGST), state GST (SGST) collection comprised Rs 26,605 crore and integrated GST (IGST) is Rs 56,247 crore (including Rs 26,884 crore collected on import of goods), according to finance ministry data.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarats-gst-collection-jumps-25-on-low-base-effect/articleshow/85846799.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Mumbai||Low supply keeping Sputnik vax out of govt drive: Dr N K Arora||Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine may not be available in government vaccination sites till supplies increase substantially, Dr N K Arora, chairman of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation, told TOI. So far, only a few lakh doses have been made available in India. Sputnik V uses two different adenoviruses as the viral vectors — adenovirus 26 (Ad26) for the first shot and adenovirus 5 (Ad5) for the second. The manufacturing of the second dose is a slow process because the virus grows very slowly. Hence, supplies have been delayed. Several private hospitals have run out of even the vaccine’s first doses, sources in hospitals in Pune told TOI on Wednesday. More first doses will be made available only when supplies of the second shot are ramped up, said Arora. “Sputnik V’s availability so far in India is not high enough to incorporate the vaccine in the government’s free vaccination programme. Only when the availability increases, a system along with cold storage can be worked out,” said Arora. The vaccine has to be stored at -18 degrees C till half an hour before administration for stability and potency. Apart from Russia, only India is currently manufacturing the vaccine. “Dr Reddy’s, which launched Sputnik V on a pilot basis in India, has been trying to resolve the second dose issue over the last two-three months. We are given to understand that they will make headway soon,” said Arora. In an email response to TOI, a spokesperson from Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Limited said: “We expect locally manufactured doses to be available from the September-October period. We have received 31.5 lakh doses of component 1 and 4.5 lakh doses of component 2 of Sputnik V in India so far. We are working closely with the RDIF (the Russian partner) to ramp up supplies.” People who want to take Sputnik V are complaining about the delay. They said hospitals that earlier had stock, are now rescheduling appointments due to supply constraints. “Sputnik V has a 21-day gap between the first and second doses. Many want to get this vaccine because fully vaccinated people have been given access to a host of relaxations,” said software engineer Vaibhav Heddurshetti.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/low-supply-keeping-sputnik-vax-out-of-govt-drive-arora/articleshow/85849217.cms||Neha Madaan

The incident took place on Wednesday afternoon. According to police, the accused, Bapu Kadam, was found hanging from a tree in one of the farms in Malipargaon village. “His mother, Praubai, was rushed to a Majalgaon-based government hospital. After her condition deteriorated, she was moved to the Beed Civil hospital where her condition continues to be critical,” a police officer said. “Some villagers have expressed suspicion over the alleged suicide. Not taking any chance, we have registered a case of accidental death and are awaiting the autopsy report to ascertain the cause of death, so that an appropriate offence is registered,” he added. Citing preliminary reports, superintendent of police R Raja said a heated argument reportedly broke out between the woman and her son. “In a fit of rage, he allegedly took a sickle and slit her throat,” Raja said. “Hearing her cries for help, other family members rushed in and saw her lying in a pool of blood. Soon, the suspect fled. While the family members were busy moving the woman from one hospital to another, report of her son committing suicide also came to fore,” he added. Bapu was taken to a government hospital where he was declared brought dead.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/man-slits-mothers-throat-before-ending-life/articleshow/85841641.cms||Mohammed Akhef

---||Nagpur||Fully vaccinated still need RT-PCR negative report for non-Covid treatment||NAGPUR: Even if you are fully vaccinated for more than two weeks and need hospitalization for non-Covid treatment, an RT-PCR negative report is compulsory at most of the private and government hospitals. Exemption from taking the Covid test too is given but only after following a rigorous screening. Emergency cases are isolated at bigger hospitals till the RT-PCR report is pending. Smaller ones don’t have the option other than asking patients to wait for the test result. Some big hospitals are performing rapid antigen test (RAT) especially for those turning up with fever and at the same time facilitating swab collection. Patients have to do it on their own at many other hospitals. Recently, some fully vaccinated patients were asked to wait for admission till they bring an RT-PCR negative. A GMCH spokesperson said the hospital ensures regular treatment is not affected due to lack of RT-PCR test. “It depends on the assessment of surgeon and anaesthetist. They take a call based on urgency of the case and condition of the patient,” he said. Dr Tushar Gawad, director (administration), Alexis Multispeciality Hospital, said, “Screening for symptoms and other relevant history is done for all patients. After screening by the clinicians, those who are fully vaccinated (14 days after 2nd dose) and asymptomatic patients are being exempted from RT-PCR testing for Covid-19. With regards to interventions, we do RAT for minor surgeries and day care procedures, while for major surgeries and procedures we do RT-PCR test.” Dr Harshvardhan Bora, internal medicine and critical care expert at Kingsway Hospital, said it depends on hospital policy. “Each hospital has its own. Some are flexible based on screening. But if patients complain of coughing and breathlessness, then a Covid test becomes necessary. If a patient is Covid-infected, it becomes a risk for fellow patients,” he said. Dr Rakesh Shah, head of administration at Wockhardt Hospitals, said as a precautionary measure, both elective surgery and ILI patients are asked for RT-PCR tests. “We do record details of vaccination too,” he said. Vidarbha Hospital Association (VHA) convenor Dr Anup Marar said as a safety measure, all hospitals do segregate the incoming patients and undertake RT-PCR tests before mixing them with admitted patients. “This prevents inadvertent exposure. Vaccination does not prevent infection but will only help reduce mortality. Fully vaccinated can also get Covid-19 and must be RT-PCR positive,” he said. Dr Marar added, “Red flag of 3rd wave will be raised when hospitals and laboratories suddenly observe a surge of increased positivity rate among the tested. Hence, if hospitals become careless and stop practice of RT-PCR screening of fresh incoming patients, it will surely backfire and will not give chance to control the outbreak. All healthcare workers should follow universal safety guidelines while dealing with any patient.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/fully-vaxxed-still-need-rt-pcr-ve-report-for-non-covid-treatment/articleshow/85846732.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Ghaziabad||Three kids among five electrocuted outside Ghaziabad shop in heavy rain||GHAZIABAD: Five people, including three children, were electrocuted at Rakesh Marg in Sihani Gate area on Wednesday morning. While two of them touched an iron pole supporting a shop’s tin shade, two others died while attempting to save them. A girl who was passing by collapsed when she stepped into the puddle to wade through. The victims include Simran (11), her cousin Surbhi (4), Simran’s mother Janaki (36), Khushi (10) and Lakshmi Narayan (24), all of whom resided in the same area. Police said Simran’s mother Krishna Devi had asked her to buy some toffees for her younger brother from the local grocery store near their house. It was raining heavily when Simran, accompanied by Surbhi, reached the shop. As the road was flooded and rainwater had accumulated everywhere, a wooden podium had been placed outside the shop while its tin roof was supported by two iron poles. Simran, who was carrying Surbhi in her arms (as seen in CCTV footage), used one of the poles to haul herself to the wooden plank. In the process, both got electrocuted. Noticing the girls falling into a pool of water, Lakshmi Narayan, who lived nearby, rushed to the spot. “He realised what had happened and tried to pull them out, but himself came in contact with the electrified pole and fell,” said his father Badri Narayan. Lakshmi had got married two years ago and he and his wife Madhumala had welcomed their second child just a month ago, Badri told TOI. Janaki, who saw Lakshmi running towards the girl, rushed to help too. “By the time she reached, Lakshmi was on the ground, shaking. She panicked and, in desperation, tried to pull the children away, but died too,” her nephew Vinod Rawat said. The leak had also electrified the puddle. Khushi, who was passing by, noticed the commotion and stepped into the rainwater to have a closer look, but collapsed to the ground. One of the residents, Rakesh, was standing at the entrance of his house a few metres away and raised the alarm. Some people tried to disengage the victims with sticks. “By the time an electrician came and cut off the power source, almost eight minutes had passed,” said Rakesh. The victims were rushed to hospital but all were declared dead on arrival. Family members react as they gather outside Sudarshan hospital after 5 people died due to electrocution, in Ghaziabad, Wednesday, Sep. 1, 2021. 1 person is in critical condition and is under treatment at the hospital (PTI Photo)Within half an hour, officials from the power department, administration and police reached the spot. Paschimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited chief engineer Pankaj said, “According to the superintendent engineer’s preliminary report, the tin shade was constructed a day before and it seems insulation of the wire was damaged. This led to an electric current passing through the shade and the poles. Some residents said they had comp-lained to the shopkeeper before but he did not fix the problem.” He stressed that there was no negligence by the department. District magistrate RK Singh set up a committee to probe the matter. “Once it submits its report in a couple of days, we will decide on the compensation,” he said. SP city Nipun Agarwal said the shopkeeper, Ramesh, had taken the store on rent a month ago. “He is absconding and we are trying to locate him. A complaint from the families is awaited, after which we will file an FIR,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/3-kids-among-5-electrocuted-outside-shop-in-heavy-rain/articleshow/85849275.cms||Abhijay Jha

In UP, out of the 39 lakh children enrolled in classes 1-5 in state-run primary schools, 21 lakh school children turned up on Wednesday. The figure is generated on the basis of midday meals served to children. The attendance was lower in government schools in Hyderabad with 20% of students attending classes on the first day of reopening after a hiatus of almost five months. Most government and budget schools, barring residential, social welfare and tribal welfare schools with hostel facilities, reopened for physical classes. Private and corporate schools continued with online classes. The attendance in government schools was attributed to midday meals, cramped homes of children and limited or no contact with friends. Not just schools, coaching centres too are limping back to normalcy. The busy coaching hub of Kota in Rajasthan successfully drew a 50% strength on Wednesday. The situation has posed a challenge for teachers as they now have to complete the course in three months instead of 10 months. Though permission to start physical classes for students of grades 9-12 was granted last week in Karnataka, most private schools are yet to throw open their doors to students. Commissioner of public instruction V Anbukumar said the data is not real time since many schools were yet to post updates in the central system. “While attendance in government schools is high, parents in many private institutes are reluctant to send their children to schools,” he said. The Assam State Disaster Management Authority on Wednesday gave a go-ahead for the reopening of schools for Class XII and final year students of graduation and post-graduation from September 6.

Dealing with an “extradition inquiry report” of Puneet, additional chief metropolitan magistrate Akash Jain recommended his extradition “for facing trial for the offences of culpable driving under section 318(1) of the Crimes Act 1958 (Victoria); negligently causing serious injury under Section 24 of the Crimes Act; improper use of a foreign travel document under Section 21(2) of Foreign Passports (Law Enforcement and Security) Act 2005 (Commonwealth)”. In the intervening night of September 30 and October 1, 2008, Puneet, allegedly driving in a drunken state, had hit two pedestrians in Victoria. While Dean Byron Hofstee died, serious injuries were caused to Clancy Coker. On October 1, Puneet was charged with culpable driving causing the death of Hofstee and negligently causing serious injuries to Coker. He was granted bail in the Melbourne magistrate’s court on his own undertaking with a number of conditions. On April 17, 2009, he pleaded guilty, but reportedly left Australia on June 12 using the passport of another Indian. The Melbourne court then issued a warrant against him for the improper use of a foreign travel document. In December 2013, an application was moved by the Union of India before the magistrate court in India for a production warrant after Punjab Police arrested him on November 29. The counsel for the accused alleged that Puneet had been targeted by the local media and local community in Australia on account of his race and nationality, which was evident from the testimony of a witness. The court said, “Merely stating that there has been a racial bias and political motivation without cogent proof will not serve the case of FC.” The lawyer had also argued that the offences made out against Puneet under the Indian law did not fall under the category of “extradition offence”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-stays-extradition-of-indian-wanted-in-australia/articleshow/85849374.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||23% of Mumbai still to get a shot, BMC asks private hospitals to chip in||MUMBAI: The civic body has urged private hospitals and corporates to donate Covid-19 vaccines for sections of the population that cannot afford to pay for it. Mumbai has administered at least one dose to 77% of the adult population. In a meeting on Monday, civic head IS Chahal had asked private hospitals to find donors who can sponsor doses lying unused at these hospitals. He said it will help the corporation cover the remaining 23% population with at least one dose at the earliest. Mumbai's estimated adult population is 93lakh, of which 71.94lakh have got at least one dose. The city received 9.8lakh doses in July and 9.96lakh in August. Dr Gautam Bhansali, who coordinates between private hospitals and the corporation, said the facilities can procure doses under the 25% quota earmarked by the Centre with help from corporate sponsors. They can place orders on CoWin and facilitate vaccinations. He said Bombay Hospital was in talks with three corporates to sponsor around 1lakh doses. “We have asked private hospital managements to look for donors,” he said. Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer, said the corporation was open to small donations as well. “If someone has 500-1,000 doses too, they can donate,” she said, adding they will be used mainly for the population living in slums. Till now, nearly 6lakh doses have been committed to the BMC under CSR. Hospitals such as Jaslok and Surana Sethia have vaccinated with doses procured with corporate funds. Godrej and HN Reliance have bought and donated to the BMC and are helping them administer it. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said the BMC doesn’t have a current count of doses lying with the private sector. “What we know is they have vaccinated more than public centres in the last two weeks,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/23-of-mumbai-still-to-get-a-shot-bmc-asks-pvt-hosps-to-chip-in/articleshow/85849327.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||In Gujarat, mobile subscribers cross 7 crore-mark||AHMEDABAD: To meet growing work and education requirements digitally, an increasing number of people across Gujarat are opting for multiple mobile connections. According to the latest telecom subscriptions report recently released by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), the number of subscribers crossed the 7-crore mark in June this year. With net addition of 2.78 lakh connections in June alone, the tele-density i.e. number of mobile subscribers per 100 population has gone up to 114 in Gujarat – the sixth highest in India. In terms of tele-density, Gujarat lags behind Delhi (324), Himachal Pradesh (158), Punjab (140), Kerala (135) and Maharashtra (117). Against a population of 6.1 crore persons according to the 2011 census, the state’s mobile subscribers have clearly exceeded the total population, indicating that people are using multiple connections. The increase in mobile subscriber numbers is mainly attributed to work from home, online classes and resumption of small and medium businesses, according to telecom industry sources. “Demand for broadband connections has shot up heavily since the pandemic due to higher bandwidth requirements for online education as well as for work from home. However, serviceability of broadband connections is a problem as all telecom players are expanding their optical fibre network,” said a telecom industry source. “The need for consistent internet connectivity however remains. People have begun opting for multiple connections to ensure consistent connectivity. In fact, many people have bought a separate SIM card which is used solely by their kids,” the source further explained. In June this year, Bharti Airtel gained some 97,526 subscribers, Reliance Jio gained some 5.43 lakh subscribers. On the other hand, Vi lost some 2.37 lakh subscribers and state-owned telecom operator, BSNL lost 1.24 lakh subscribers. This overall pushed the total subscriber numbers up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/mobile-subscribers-cross-7cr-mark/articleshow/85846917.cms||Niyati Parikh

For many years, they continued their traditional business without any hiccups. However, four years ago, the brothers went separate ways. Shafi ran into losses in his business and approached Chand Pasha again to take him as his partner. After several consultations, Chand Pasha agreed to the proposal on humanitarian grounds as Shafi had three daughters, police said. Though Shafi had a second chance, he did not change his attitude.

Police suspect that parents also hanged themselves after seeing their son’s body hanging. Yogesh Ghatal (31) was very disturbed after recovering from Covid-19 and he attempted suicide thrice since April. He was rescued at the last moment by family members in the past, police said. However, Ghatal’s body was found hanging from a branch of a tree while bodies of his parents Jatar (58) and Manki (56) were found on another nearby tree. The bodies were first spotted by Ghatal’s sister Rasilawhen she reached their house as none of them were not answering calls. Rasila is married in Molaamba and lives in the same village. She used to call her parents and brother daily to inquire about their health. On Tuesday, when she reached the house, the door was open but there was no one nearby. Later, while searching she spotted the bodies on a tree. A case of accidental death was registered in Vansda police station after police recovered the bodies and sent them for postmortem. “Preliminary investigation suggests its a a suicide. We are awaiting a postmortem report to get more details,” said an officer in Vansda police station.  Ghatal was married and has a three-year-old daughter. His wife went to her parents’ house to celebrate Raksha Bandhan with her daughter and was not at home when the incident took place. “Ghatal was disturbed since April after he contracted Covid-19. He recovered after a mild fever but he had been living a tense life since then. He had tried to kill himself by hanging thrice but his parents kept close watch on him and he was rescued,” said police. He went to a nearby forest area or on a hill to end life but his parents searched for him and brought him back. “His parents also committed suicide due to the son’s suicide. They must have felt that they could not save him and it led to the extreme step,” said police. The family does farming on their own land and also goes to work on farms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/covid-recovered-man-his-parents-hang-selves-in-vansda/articleshow/85844164.cms||---

A native of Banda’s Pachokhar village in Tindwari town, Ram Bahadur was reeling under a psychological disorder and had illegally crossed over to Pakistan, police said. He was arrested on suspicion that he was an Indian spy and was released on August 30. He was handed over to the Punjab authorities, said senior police officials on Wednesday. Speaking to the media, his family members thanked the government for bringing him back to India. After Ram Bahadur went missing in 2009, his family members lodged a complaint with the Tindwari police station. A case was registered in this regard and as efforts were on to trace him, the family came to know in January 2021 that he was detained in Pakistan. His father Gilla Prajapati told reporters that Ram Bahadur was mentally unsound and went missing some 12 years ago. “We had searched, but couldn’t find him. We presumed him dead in some accident, and we did not have even the slightest of inkling that he crossed the border and reached Pakistan and was imprisoned there,” said Prajapati. His younger brother Maiku said that Ram Bahadur was the eldest of the two brothers. Village head Santosh Kumar said that detailed information about Ram Bahadur has been made available to the district administration. “On Tuesday, Lekhpal Khushbu Gupta reached Ram Bahadur’s house and got him identified through video calling. Later, Amritsar administration and Army officers interacted with Ram Bahadur’s father Gilla Prajapati and mother Kusuma,” said village head Santosh Kumar. “Pakistani authorities had released him on Monday. He reached India via Attari. However, he has been kept in the hospital in Amritsar, Punjab. He will be there for two days. On the instructions of the government, the Banda administration and police officials have verified Ram Bahadur and sent the report to the Amritsar administration,” informed superintendent of police Banda, Abhinandan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/banda-resident-releasedfrom-pak-jail-after-12-yrs/articleshow/85849336.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Got LPA approval? No need to pay security deposit to corporation||Coimbatore: The city corporation has decided not to collect security deposit from the residents for building approvals if they have already obtained a nod from the local planning authority. The move has brought cheers to the residents as well as builders.A corporation official said the local bodies were empowered to grant planning permission to the residential buildings up to a height of 12 metres and a built-up area of 10,000sqft with a maximum of eight dwelling units spread over stilt plus three floors or ground plus two floors. Buildings with bigger size need to get approval from the local planning authority.However, for the past three years, the civic body has been collecting security deposits from the people who had already obtained permission from the local planning authority. In effect, the residents had to pay deposits with both the agencies. Deposit amounts would usually be returned to the applicants after successfully obtaining a building completion certificate. But the amount would be forfeited, if the building violates the norms.The civic body collects Rs 75 per sqft for residential buildings and Rs 150 per sqft for commercial buildings as the deposit amount.This practise was set right after office-bearers of the Confederation of Real Estate Developers Associations of India (Credai) took up the issue with corporation commissioner Raja Gopal Sunkara. The decision not to collect security deposit from the residents for the buildings approved by the local planning authority was taken at a council meeting that was held on July 30, the official said. However, the resolutions of the meeting were uploaded on the website only on Tuesday.Gugan Ilango, president, district chapter of Credai, said only the city corporation here was collecting security deposit from the residents who had already obtained building approval from the local planning authority. “Hence, we took up the issue with top officials. The decision not to collect the deposit amount by both the agencies will surely bring relief to the residents planning to construct houses.”The process to get back the security deposit from the local body, he said, was often tedious. “It was a long pending problem. We had talked to various elected representatives and corporation commissioners. Our grievance was considered in the right spirit and an appropriate decision has been taken.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/got-lpa-approval-no-need-to-pay-security-deposit-to-corporation/articleshow/85846921.cms||V Devanathan

---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Covid forced working class to shun 50% healthy food, says survey||DEHRADUN: With the pandemic, the working class cut back on nutritional food by at least half. A survey of daily wage workers, domestic workers, small farmers and shopkeepers in Uttarakhand, Tamil Nadu and Delhi found that consumption of nutritional food dropped alarmingly as a direct fallout of their economic condition. The share of those who consumed eggs dropped from from 77% before the pandemic to 30% by July this year, chicken from 72% to 22%, bananas from 79% to 53% and fruits other than bananas from 69% to 26%, the survey by Delhi-based Kislay Social Research Collective found. Some drops were sharper than the average — egg consumption went from 61% pre-pandemic to 14% in Delhi and chicken from 87% to 8% in Dehradun. The consumption of oil and ghee had gone down for 75% of those surveyed, that of dal for 67%, and of milk for 66%. Here, too, some places fared worse than the average — Uttarakhand hills reported the highest drop in oil and ghee consumption (79%), Tamil Nadu in dal (77%) and milk (74%). “Our survey indicates an unnoticed nutritional disaster may be underway across most of the country,” the report said. “A sharp reduction in eggs, oil and ghee, dal, milk, vegetables and fruits implies a major drop in nutrition,” said Shankar Gopal, research coordinator for the survey. The drastic change came with a shift in their livelihoods. “Many Indians don’t have secure jobs. During lockdown, most lost all their sources of income. Many who went home are still unemployed or working for much lower wages,” said Gopal. “Daily wagers who went back to work find there is much less work now. With less work, there is less money and less food to put on the table.” Of those surveyed, 66% said they were unemployed for the entire period between April 1 and July 5 this year and 46% said they were making less than half now than they did before the pandemic. Covid also aggravated debt. Over 62% of those surveyed said they had to borrow money because of the pandemic this year. Of them, 64% said they have not been able to repay anything yet; just 1% said they have been able to pay back what they owed. The report said, “There has been no return to normalcy for most of our participants.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/covid-forced-working-class-to-shun-50-of-its-nutritional-food-survey/articleshow/85844262.cms||Shivani Azad

From March to June, restaurants, hotels, banquet halls and marriage palaces were subjected to many restrictions due to the severe second wave of coronavirus. Now after two months of easing restrictions, like allowing dine-in and increasing the cap on number of guests at marriages and other functions, the hospitality industry, especially restaurants and banquet halls, is breathing a sigh of relief. However, the marriage palaces are still to revive business as big budget weddings have not started. Businessmen want the state and the Centre to help revive the industry.Shiv Shankar Rai, hotelier and general secretary of Punjab Tent Dealers’ Welfare Association, said, “The hospitality industry has passed through the worst phase this year, from complete ban on holding marriage functions to being allowed to host only 20 guests per event. A large number of tent house owners, caterers and event managers left the business and there were many layoffs since March. Even five-star hotels were forced to cut down staff strength. But now after two months of easing of restrictions, businesses have finally started picking up.”Rai added, “Footfall and bookings have resumed, but big functions are not taking place as of now because of which marriage palaces are not registering business, but there are queries for November and December.”Mayank Chabra, owner of a restaurant in Sarabha Nagar, said, “Since March, we have suffered heavy losses. In June after restrictions eased, the customer footfall was low due to the fear of another wave of coronavirus. But now business is seeing some revival though it is still not back to normal. The biggest problem we are facing is an increase in our fixed expenditures, like electricity bill and cooking gas. In the past one year, sales have fallen, but these expenses have been rising constantly. Therefore, we request the state and the Centre to do something to support our industry, like reducing power charges and introducing interest-free loans.”Prem Singh Baghel, an event manager, had to shut down his office due to no business in the past several months. “Now queries for parties have started coming, but the majority of the people are opting for smaller gatherings. It is okay for me as we had been sitting idle for so long. We hope things will improve in the coming months if Covid doesn't strike again.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/hospitality-industry-starts-filling-cup-but-is-waiting-to-say-cheers/articleshow/85844267.cms||Mohit Behl

---||Nagpur||‘Prolonged school closure will lead to generational catastrophe’||Unicef, the world’s premier body dealing with various aspects of children’s lives, strongly feels that school reopening must not be delayed anymore. Rajeshwari Chandrasekar, who has spent almost 25 years with Unicef and is currently the chief of field office in its Maharashtra unit, told TOI the longer schools remain closed, greater will be the generational learning loss. Excerpts... Unicef India has stated that delay in reopening schools may lead to ‘generational catastrophe’... Not reopening schools has multiple ripple effects which has impacted not only children’s education, but also their physical and emotional well-being. In terms of what we call generational catastrophe is to look at childhood as a lost future due to school closure. This prolonged closure affects the skills that children would have acquired and made them productive future workers. When reopening is planned, a remedial learning package for students to make up for the academic loss has to be thought of. But schooling does continue at many places in online mode... We have seen that the current distance learning strategies which are being used are partially effective. A national-level study covering 80,000 school students and parents showed that the latter felt their children were learning considerably less as compared to previous years. The same study showed that around 90% students (Std II-VI) lost at least one foundational ability in language and maths compared to previous year. And that’s why we feel that school closures come at the cost of learning. Does this mean the situation would be worse for those who have not been able to continue education even online? There are many out-of-school kids and that number is increasing. The longer they are out of school, the more their likelihood of not returning to campus thereby worsening the learning crisis and, therefore the generational catastrophe we talked about earlier. Maharashtra has reopened schools (Std VIII onwards) in rural areas but has kept on hold the GR which would have permitted reopening in urban areas too. What is Unicef’s suggestion on reopening? Just last week, I attended the Maharashtra Covid-19 task force meeting on school reopening. What Unicef would like to suggest is to give priority to vaccination of teachers so that when reopening happens, it will help stop transmission. Second point is to prepare schools through local administration to follow SOPs laid down by the state. They can go through the checklist that Unicef has developed in partnership with state education department and other stakeholders. Third is to explore different modules which may include staggered reopening, multiple shifts, alternate day classes etc, along with continuing the online hybrid model. So, the online teaching model must not stop? It must continue because if tomorrow the infections start to rise, then you can again close down schools. But to keep schools closed waiting for the D-Day is not going to work. We have to get schools prepared for such a scenario. What about primary school kids? We have been advocating on how to prioritize reopening for primary school kids given the impact of school closure on them. These are their foundational years and if you do not provide them the opportunity of learning and socializing with peers/teachers, then you have lost a generation already. How will Unicef contribute to this? We have proposed to the Maharashtra government that Unicef can develop a reopening model in 100 schools spread across the state. We will demonstrate how local administration can develop decision tools to see under what criteria to reopen, when to shut etc. These 100 schools can then become a model which can be implemented by every institute.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/prolonged-school-closure-will-lead-to-generational-catastrophe/articleshow/85846985.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

Days later, on Wednesday, he was booked in his own thana, where he is posted as the SHO, for allegedly taking a bribe of Rs 1 lakh to let off a man with a stolen truck. A decorated officer, inspector Vijenderpal Rana was part of the police team -- led by the then SP Ajay Sahni -- that had shot dead Shiv Shakti Naidu, a dreaded gangster who had pulled off a sensational Rs 8 crore heist in Delhi’s Lajpat Nagar in 2014. Kingpin of the notorious Naidu gang, he was killed on February 18 last year during an encounter. Sahni and Vijenderpal Rana were awarded the Police Gallantry Medal for the encounter on August 15. Vijenderpal Rana’s downhill slide from being a celebrated cop to an “absconding accused” was quick; it took him just 15 days. Superintendent of police Vineet Bhatnagar said, "The inspector is wanted in the bribery case. He has not returned yet.” An FIR has been registered at Meerut’s Sadar police station. Gaurav Rana, acting SHO of the police station, told TOI that his predecessor and head constable Manmohan Singh have been booked under various sections of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. “We arrested the constable redhanded as he was taking a Rs 50,000- bribe from the scrap dealer with the truck. Inspector Rana had also taken a bribe of around Rs 1 lakh. The FIR was filed on the orders of the SSP,” the SHO added. Vijenderpal Rana had declared his police station “corruption free” a few days ago. He had even put up a board outside the thana asking visitors to report any incident of bribery. According to sources, the graft came to light when SP Bhatnagar noticed discrepancies in an FIR registered at Sadar police station regarding the theft of a truck. Important points were missing from it. Further investigation led the IPS officer to the alleged corruption case. “We had found that the SHO Sadar (Vijenderpal Rana) and a constable in his team were harassing a junk dealer," a senior police officer involved in the investigation said. "When we spoke to the man, he told us that the SHO and the constable were asking for money. To catch them red-handed, we asked the dealer to go to the constable’s home and give him Rs 50,000 as bribe. We nabbed the policeman there itself. The inspector is still missing though.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/up-cop-with-gallantry-medal-on-aug-15-booked-for-graft-on-sept-1/articleshow/85844299.cms||Ishita Mishra

SP national president Akhilesh Yadav was in Hardoi on Wednesday to attend a private engagement when mediapersons asked about his stance in case Naresh Agarwal, a powerful political figure of Hardoi who had joined the BJP in 2018, wants to return to the SP. He said he would consider his induction in the SP if he says that he has been insulted in the BJP. "The SP has always honoured people," Akhilesh added. In response to another media query on Agarwal hopping over from one political party to another in order to remain closer to the power, the former UP CM said he is seen as a (political) weather scientist but his radar failed in 2017. A Rajya Sabha MP in the SP, Naresh Agarwal snapped ties with Akhilesh Yadav and had joined the BJP after he was denied a ticket to biennial elections to the Upper House held in March 2018. Akhilesh had given a ticket to Jaya Bachchan instead. At that time some senior SP leaders were of the view that in 2017 assembly elections Naresh Agarwal had secretly helped the BJP in and around Hardoi. While joining the BJP, Naresh Agarwal, who was one of the most vocal SP MPs in Parliament, had not burnt his bridges completely with the SP and went on record to say that he will always remain grateful to SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav. However, his comments made in apparent reference to Jaya Bhaduri Bachchan had left the BJP squirming. Without taking names Naresh Agarwal said he was rejected by the SP leadership for “… those who dance in films, work in films …”. His remarks did not go down well with the BJP and then external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj described his comments as “improper and unacceptable”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sp-not-against-naresh-returning-to-party-fold/articleshow/85849384.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: On Teachers’ Day, teachers to protest irregular salaries||MUMBAI: Teaching and non-teaching staff of government and aided schools will protest against non-receipt of salaries on September 5, which is celebrated as Teachers’ Day. Salaries for August, amounting to Rs 140 crore, have not been disbursed in Mumbai alone, said Shivnath Darade, secretary, Maharashtra Rajya Shikshak Parishad. Across the state, the amount is Rs 1,900 crore. The July salaries of some teachers were received as late as last week. With the Ganesh Chaturthi around the corner, the teachers are insisting on being paid. TimesViewTeachers drawing government salaries have been carrying out Covid-related duties since the pandemic struck. Their demand to be declared ‘Corona Warriors’ that entails some benefits has gone unheard; now all they are asking for is timely payment of salaries, especially during the festivals. The government should ensure their salaries are released on time.Darade said a few teachers will sit on a hunger strike outside the deputy director of education’s office on Charni Road on Sunday. Many teachers wanted to participate, but they have been discouraged due to Covid. All Covid protocols will be followed while protesting, he added. This protest comes on the heels of the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) staffers protesting on Monday after a driver in Dhule committed suicide over irregular salaries. The 44-year-old driver was depressed as he had loans of Rs 5 lakh. Darade said teachers, too, are on the same boat. “Teachers have housing loans and due to irregular salaries, they are being penalised by their banks,” said Darade. Many private school teachers are also complaining that they have not received salaries since the academic year began in June. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-on-teachers-day-teachers-to-protest-irregular-salaries/articleshow/85849411.cms||---

The man died on Saturday and his daughter on the following day. The investigators have concluded that the grenade had been illegally obtained by someone through Army or paramilitary contacts. On Saturday, Ramesh Faneja, 30, died on the spot in the powerful explosion while his three family members were injured. The blast rocked the family’s house in Godhkulla village under Shamlaji taluka of Aravalli district, special operations group police inspector J P Bharwad said. The next day, Faneja’s two-year-old daughter Sweety died during treatment, while his wife Sangita and another daughter Aayushi, 11, are still in hospital, Bharwad said. “A forensic analysis has now revealed that it was a hand grenade which exploded when Faneja was trying to pull out its pin,” an investigator said. “Faneja’s friends, Vinod Faneja and Jignesh Faneja, found the grenade six months ago on a pasture land near a pond,” Bharwad said. “They had given the grenade to Faneja and it had been with him since then.” Sangita said in her statement to police that her husband kept the grenade because he reckoned that he could use it sometime in the future. On Saturday, he was trying to remove its pin when the blast occurred, she said. Shamlaji police of Aravalli district have lodged an FIR against Faneja and Vinod for negligence causing death. Other relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code have been invoked as well. Meanwhile, police found a photograph in which Faneja was seen with the grenade dangling from his waist, Aravalli superintendent of police Sanjay Kharat said. In another photograph, Faneja was seen holding an automatic rifle, he said. Kharat said: “We found such photos in his mobile phone and on his social media accounts.” He said a detailed probe has been launched to determine the exact source of the grenade and Faneja’s motive in possessing it. “Many youths from this region are in the Army and paramilitary forces,” Kharat said. “Some of them were Faneja’s friends.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/blast-that-killed-2-caused-by-grenade-cops/articleshow/85847004.cms||---

The university recently conducted both online and offline (pen and paper) format exams for commerce and law courses. The results of BCom second and sixth semesters were announced on Tuesday. “On the same day, the results were declared for law students who were in their fourth and sixth semesters. This caused a huge inflow of traffic on the university’s official website, causing it to crash,” said a GU sources. It took more than 24 hours for the university to restore the website, sources added. Some students claimed that the website was pulled down by the authorities after complaints that some law undergraduate students who did not take the exam had cleared it. “On the other hand, the website indicated that some students who had secured 55 marks or even more had failed,” said sources. The university officials maintained that the server had crashed with more than 80,000 students trying to access their results online at the same time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gu-website-down-for-24-hours/articleshow/85847035.cms||---
---||Trichy||DST pat for Trichy prof’s waste management technology||Trichy: A low-cost waste management model developed by a Trichy-based college professor has earned the appreciation of the central department of science and technology (DST) which has featured his work in its official website. The novel model which has been funded by DST converts toxic sludge generated in textile dyeing units into environment-friendly compost in 90 days by using adapted bacteria, cow dung and earthworm. The field trial of the process has yielded favourable results following which the department of science and technology (DST) has suggested for a largescale adoption in the textile dyeing units after passing further laboratory clearances. The model was promulgated by S Senthil Kumar, assistant professor, department of botany, National College, Trichy. Kumar said that the sludge usually generated by the effluent treatment plant in textile dyeing units were left idle. The sludge, a by-product of biological effluent treatment has toxic chemicals and salt. The professor who visited various textile dyeing units analysed the sludge that was stagnant for years. In his study, he found that a particular bacteria identified as Lysinibacillus sphaericus has adapted to the textile effluent. The adapted bacteria was moved to a fresh sludge for pre-treatment for 30 days. Later, cow dung and earthworms were applied and released into the sludge for 60 days. After the process, the toxic industrial sludge becomes compost, similar to the manure produce from municipal solid waste. “The advantage of the study funded by the department of science technology is, the process can be conducted on the site and requires no major investment. The compost can be used to grow plants or even as an environment-friendly landfill,” Kumar said. The field study was conducted at the Perundurai common effluent treatment plant (CETP) in Erode district. The results of the preliminary on-site study have disclosed an effective stabilisation and mineralisation of nutrients in the industrial sludge. “We are in the process of validating the compost through a nationally accredited laboratory after which the waste conversion model can be formally emulated,” the professor added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/dst-pat-for-trichy-profs-waste-management-technology/articleshow/85847045.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Allahabad||HC reserves verdict on pleas against court order directing ASI survey||Prayagraj: The Allahabad high court on Tuesday reserved its order on the petitions challenging a Varanasi court’s order directing the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to ‘conduct a comprehensive physical survey’ of the Kashi Vishwanath Temple (KVT)-Gyanvapi mosque complex in order to find out whether a temple was demolished to build the mosque that stands there adjacent to KVT. The court said it would pronounce its judgment on September 9, 2021, at 2 p.m. The petitioners, UP Sunni Central Waqf Board and Anjuman Intazamia Masazid, Varanasi have challenged the Varanasi court’s order dated April 8, 2021. Justice Prakash Padia reserved the order after hearing counsel for the petitioners, counsel for the Central government, the state government and others. Earlier at one stage, while appearing for one of the petitioners, its counsel had contended that the suit on which the order of the civil judge (senior division), fast-track court (FTC) of Varanasi (dated April 8, 2021) is under challenge, is itself not maintainable under Section 4 of the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991, as it bars filing of suit or any other legal proceedings with respect to conversion of religious character of any place of worship, existing on August 15, 1947. Hence, no claim can be made regarding a religious place which existed on August 15, 1947. As per the Act of 1991, no relief can be sought for changing the status of any religious place as it existed on August 15, 1947, contended the petitioner’s counsel. Hence the order for conducting survey is illegal, the counsel had added. The petitioner’s counsel further contended that when the high court has already reserved its judgment on the issue of maintainability of the aforesaid suit, the court below should not have passed any order in the suit till the issue of maintainability of the suit was decided by the high court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hc-reserves-verdict-on-pleas-against-court-order-directing-asi-survey/articleshow/85849472.cms||---

---||Nagpur||7k workers to start sweeping gardens, grounds daily||Nagpur: Gardens, playgrounds, squares, areas around statues etc are likely to be cleaner over the next few days, as Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) will utilize around 7,000 sanitary workers to sweep these areas along with the roads. The civic body is also planning to improve monitoring of sanitary workers by upgrading the GPS Watch System. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B told TOI, “Each sanitary worker is given a stretch of around 500m for sweeping. It is observed that they finish sweeping by 10.30am. Then, they sit along the roads and wait to register their attendance at 2pm. They have lunch from 11 to 11.30am. We plan to utilize them from 11.30am onwards till 2pm at public places like gardens, playgrounds, squares, area around statues etc,” he said. Currently gardens, playgrounds, areas around statues, squares and other public places are not swept daily. Sweeping is done as and when required, or after receiving complaints. Majority of the playgrounds are in bad condition as far as sanitation is concerned. Sanitary workers currently only sweep roads and clean sewage lines. This would be the first time sanitary workers will be engaged in sweeping gardens, playgrounds etc on daily basis. Radhakrishnan added directives have been given to the agency to upgrade GPS Watch System introduced to monitor the works and ensure proper attendance of sanitary workers. “An alert should come automatically in the inbox of sanitary inspectors about the number of sanitary workers wearing watches. In the same manner, sanitary inspectors should get automatic intimation about sanitary workers’ presence in fixed geo fencing area. It is very difficult to watch each and every sanitary worker in existing system,” he said. Following irregularities in attendance of sanitary workers, and to ensure neat and clean city, NMC and Bengaluru-based ITI Limited, a central government undertaking, had launched GPS Watch System in 2018. The attendance of sanitary workers is registered as per the GPS Watch and monthly salaries are released. Around 7,000 workers and some officials were given the watches. However, following strong opposition from sanitary workers, backed by the corporators, NMC had to stop GPS Watch System many times. Till today, salaries of sanitary workers are not prepared as per this system. Still, NMC continues to pay Rs207 per watch per month for a total of Rs16.56 lakh per month to the company for development, operation and maintenance of the system.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/7k-workers-to-start-sweeping-gardens-grounds-daily/articleshow/85847086.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Ahmedabad||Kalol explosion: FIR against two former ONGC staffers||AHMEDABAD: Police have filed an FIR of criminal negligence causing death in connection with the blast of a pipeline of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), which killed three persons in December 2020. The pipeline passed beneath a residential society in Kalol. Police filed the FIR on Tuesday for giving the nod to build the housing society despite the knowledge that the gas pipeline passed under the land in question. The FIR states that permissions were given by several government agencies and ONGC despite the knowledge that the gas pipeline might pose a risk to people. The FIR of Kalol taluka police names a former land acquisition officer of ONGC, Dipak Narolia, who had on June 15, 2009, given the NOC (no-objection certificate) to build the housing society. It also names a former head draftsman of ONGC, Ghanshyam Patel. Besides, the FIR mentions “the person from AUDA who got the land converted from agricultural to NA (non-agricultural) use in 2008.” The FIR also cites “the person who committed irregularity in getting NOCs from various departments concerned, and the builder who carried out construction work in 2010.” Further, police have moved against “all the responsible persons who were involved in the irregularity.” The blast killed Amit Dave, 26, Pinal Dave, 26, and Hansa Dave, 76, residents of house number 159 in Garden Society in Saij village in Kalol. Their neighbour in house number 158, Hasmukh Patel, suffered injuries. The explosion occurred at about 7.30am on December 22, 2020. The FIR has come at a time when a public interest litigation is being heard by the Gujarat high court seeking a police complaint against the accused and compensation for the victims. During the probe, the investigators wrote to the HR head of ONGC, S K Chaturvedi, about the pipeline. He had replied on December 23, 2020, that there was no active gas pipeline beneath the society and an unused pipeline lay there. On January 25, 2021, Chaturvedi told the investigators that the gas pipeline had been active till September 24, 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/kalol-explosion-fir-against-two-former-ongc-staffers/articleshow/85847090.cms||---

The department has planned to conduct exclusive vaccination camps for the workers and employers within a week. The department also plans to host vaccination camps for street vendors at Central bus stand, Chathiram bus stand and Thiruverumbur from September 3. “We found that only 50-60% of the workers and employees from hotels, eateries, bakeries and sweet stalls have received the jab. The employers were told to conduct vaccination audit in their establishments,” Dr R Ramesh Babu, district food safety officer told TOI. Shops that have not vaccinated majority of their employees may even be asked to remain closed for a few days, officials said. If the employees cite health issues as the reason for not getting the jab, they will not be forced, officials added. “Major eateries and chain of hotels have vaccinated almost all their employees. We are focusing the small outlets now and encouraging them to take the jab,” he said. In the recent sensitization meeting held in Trichy on Tuesday, the shop owners were also told to have a valid FSSAI certificate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-dist-admin-mandates-jab-for-food-industry-workers/articleshow/85847081.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Schools record 64% attendance on Day 1||Coimbatore: On the first day of school reopening for Classes IX to XII on Wednesday, more than 64% students turned up at the government and private schools in the district. Entering the school campus was altogether a different experience for the students, who were thermal screened for temperature and allowed in only after confirming they were not having any Covid-19 symptoms. They were also made to sanitize their hands. Class X and XII students of last year had gone through this process when the schools were reopened for them a few weeks before the second wave in February. But Covid norms are stricter this time. Teachers were seen checking if the students were wearing face masks properly at regular intervals, while ensuring their compliance with social distancing. Only a student was seated on a bench. When they returned to the schools after a gap of four months, enthusiasm was high among the Class XII students. As per the available data with the district chief education office, more than 70% Class XII students had turned up at the government and private schools on the day. N Geetha, district chief education officer, said, “Since the Class XII board exams play a crucial role in the college admission process, parents were concerned about the coaching and wanted offline classes to resume soon.” Class X students too showed interest in attending the physical classes and 68% of them had turned up on the first day, she said. The response from Class IX and XI students was, however, comparatively dismal, especially at the government schools where their attendance stood at nearly 48%. Geetha said she had asked teachers to take efforts to bring more students back to the schools after checking the reason for absenteeism. The fear of Covid-19 also seems to have forced a few parents to decide against sending their wards to schools. Samson Selladurai, principal, Nava Bharath International School, said 89% of students was present in the school on the first day. “Parents of three of the 101 students are apprehensive about a possible Covid-19 spread. They want to send their wards only after vaccination. While we tried to convince them, we didn’t put pressure on them to send their kids to the school. We have decided to take a call after a week.” Some students, meanwhile, faced transportation issues because of the flyover work on Mettupalayam Road. Since the buses from Mettupalayam, Karamadai and Periyanaickenpalayam are diverted at Vellakinaru Pirivu, students going to educational institutions at Kavundampalayam and the city had to walk all the distance. Many had to skip schools because of this. City colleges didn’t see many students on Wednesday. Long distance travel, reopening in the middle of the week were cited as reasons for low turnout of students. College managements, however, said they were expecting more students in the coming days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/schools-record-64-attendance-on-day-1/articleshow/85847155.cms||Sampath Kumar

---||Lucknow||Two Ayodhya children battling rare debilitating disease need imported injections of Rs 32 crore||AYODHYA: The family of two minor brothers battling a rare debilitating disease — muscular dystrophy — has appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Yogi Adityanath to provide aid for importing life-saving medicines, which cost over Rs 32crore. Prakhar,12, and Prajwal,10, residents of Rauva Lohangpur village of Ayodhya district, take wobbly steps before stumbling on the ground when they try to walk. Their radiant faces grimace in pain as they are forced to crawl to perform daily chores amidst a swift degeneration of their skeletal muscles that control motor movement. Their father, Dharmendra Pandey, a farmer by profession, has depleted his resources after spending over Rs25 lakh in their treatment. Doctors at AIIMS told the family that two injections costing Rs 16crore each need to be imported from the US to treat this rare genetic disease. Talking to TOI, Dharmendra said, “Seven years ago, my elder son, Prakhar, was afflicted by muscular dystrophy. Later the younger one, Prajwal, too was diagnosed with the disease. I have no money left and living in despair. My wife, Sadhana, and my father, Rambahal, cannot watch the kids in trauma anymore. We visited the country’s best hospitals, including King George’s Medical University, SGPGI, AIIMS-Delhi and even travelled to Udaipur and Kerala, but found no succour.” Finally, doctors at AIIMS, Delhi, told Pandey that his sons can recover if an injection imported from the US is administered. “With each vial costing Rs 16crore, I need Rs 32crore for their treatment. I am pleading with PM Narendra Modi, CM Yogi Adityanath and the people of the country to help my children,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/two-ayodhya-kids-battling-rare-debilitating-disease-need-imported-injections-of-rs-32cr/articleshow/85849529.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

The flight had last operated on April 9.An Air India official said, “We have got information from the higher authorities that Ludhiana-Delhi flight will remain suspended till October 31. Less load (of passengers) and technical reasons, besides Covid-related issues, are the reasons for the continued suspension of the flight. We don’t know whether the flight will operate or remain suspended after that. Fewer number of 72 ATR planes for multiple destinations may also be a reason for its suspension.”“There is another problem—as per the new Directorate General Civil Aviation guidelines, there should be 5,000 metre visibility for the landing of a flight, which is hard to find at Sahnewal airport in the morning and evening hours. The meteorological department had said this kind of visibility is normally between noon and 3pm at Sahnewal. Earlier, there was a requirement of 1,500 metre visibility,” an airport official said.Air India officials said they were receiving a few queries on resumption of the flight.Residents, especially the business community, are anxiously waiting for the flight to resume.“For a business city like Ludhiana, air connectivity is a must. Businessmen do trade with clients from across the country. And both prefer air travel to save time,” said Ajeet Singh, a city businessman.Low occupancyThe data of Delhi-Ludhiana flight shows that during the first 19 days of March, its average occupancy was mostly below 50%. It was 52.14% on March 20 and fell to 30% by March 27, when the last flight operated in the month.

The police team, who was accompanying the deceased cop on the day of the incident, told the court that he tried to stop the vehicle being driven by the accused after a tip-off from LIU that they were involved in "cow smuggling".

---||Ahmedabad||Upload all old gazettes in six months: HC||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Wednesday asked the state government to upload all of its previously published gazettes on its official website within six months. This was after advocate Bandish Soparkar filed a PIL in January seeking directions to the state government to update all government notifications on its official portal. He demanded that all government notifications/gazettes should be made available to public online. The central government and 22 state governments do it regularly and post their notifications timely on their websites for public consumption. However, Gujarat was quite irregular in this practice. The petitioner had submitted that the Directorate of Government Printing and Stationery is bound to issue free of cost copies of government gazettes. The e-publication of gazette takes place only with regard to change in names, and there are various notifications and special gazettes that are not made available to public on its website. The court had inquired with the state government about e-publishing of its gazettes and notifications. The government pleader submitted that the state government has already started e-publishing all the notifications issued by the government on its portal. She further submitted that as far as the past or old notifications are concerned, such gazettes would also be e-published in a short time as the process for the same is underway. The petitioner urged the court to fix a time frame for uploading all old gazettes on the official portal and the state government agreed to complete the task within six months. Accordingly, the HC issued direction to e-publish old gazettes in six months and disposed the PIL.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/upload-all-old-gazettes-in-six-months-hc/articleshow/85847158.cms||---

But on Wednesday when schools and colleges reopened after a wide gap, these shops remained deserted. “We are being approached mostly for stitching the old bags. Sales of new bags sales are down since a year now. We are gradually launching other services such as mobile recharge to compensate for the loss,” P Murugesan, a school bag seller near Chathiram bus stand said. Though the reopening of schools was finalised early, the shopkeepers said that there was not much of sales in recent days. Parents ask students to use the same bags due to their economic situation, particularly after the lockdowns, the shopkeepers added. “If schools opened for normal classes, assignments given in bulk would result in some sales of papers and other stationery items. Even on the opening day, sales were not as like those in the previous years,” K Suresh, a stationery outlet owner in Palakkarai said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/stationery-sellers-see-no-jump-in-sales/articleshow/85847147.cms||---
---||Nagpur||MP baby undergoes heart operation within hours of birth, survives||Nagpur: A healthy appearing newborn turned blue within a few hours of birth at Satna hospital in Madhya Pradesh. The treating paediatrician there suspected some critical cyanotic heart disease. Due to lack of facilities there, the baby boy was rushed from Satna to Kingsway Hospital in Nagpur in an ambulance across 480km in eight hours on August 14. At Kingsway, it was found that the baby’s oxygen level was just 40%. The baby was placed under the care of paediatric cardiologist Dr Praneet Lale. The baby was diagnosed with a severe heart condition — obstructed infracardiac total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC). The same night, the infant underwent a six-hour-long procedure to repair the complex heart defect. Last week, he was discharged in a stable condition. Cardiac surgeons Dr Sachin Kuthe and Dr Pratiksha Jaiswal and cardiac anaesthesist Dr Manish Sonkusale performed the operation. Intensivists Dr Kuldeep Sukhadeve, Dr Rajkumar Kiratkar, Dr Deepak Goel, Dr Priyanaka Wankar and Dr Ganpat Jha were part of post-operative care. Dr Lale said that had the surgery not been done, the baby may not have survived. “It is a congenital disease. It can happen in any baby. The baby will have an absolutely normal life and he can even participate in competitive sports. He needs to follow up once a year,” said Dr Lale. In this case, the vessels carrying purified blood from the lungs drained through the liver. “One in 10,000 babies have chances of having TAPVC. Out of this, the incidence of obstructed infracardiac TAPVC is much less. Such cases must be operated as soon as possible after birth. If not operated on time, such babies can’t survive. The little boy was a fighter to survive the long road journey,” he said. He further said that the heart defect can be detected in ultrasound during pregnancy but requires highly trained specialist such as paediatric cardiologist and fetal medicine specialist. Dr Lale said that paediatric cardiac surgery is for congenital heart defects. “The incidence of congenital heart defects is eight per 1,000 live births. Paediatric cardiac surgery is a unique speciality as it deals with newborns and small children with major and complex heart defects which are present since birth. The surgeries are very complex, demanding and need great skills for good results,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mp-baby-undergoes-heart-operation-within-hours-of-birth-survives/articleshow/85847135.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

The woman, identified as Nauta, was the accused man's mother. He murdered her after she tried to stop him from smuggling smack. According to police, Shubham, with the help of the friend, strangulated his mother. The crime took place on August 23 at Bahupura village when Nauta was on her way to attend the mourning of her father's death.

The court noted that the accident badly affected the childhood of three innocent children. Shah sought bail after the filing of the chargesheet against him by police. However, additional sessions judge J A Thakkar was not convinced that filing of the chargesheet would weigh in favour of the accused so far as his case for bail was concerned. The court also expressed apprehension that once granted bail, there is the possibility of tampering with evidence. It concluded that looking at the larger interest of society, Shah cannot be granted bail. The court briefly discussed details from the chargesheet, that Shah’s car may have been at a speed of 90km per hour at the time of the accident. The court said that among the four persons who sustained injuries, three are children younger than seven years. “Therefore, it is required to be considered at this stage that the childhood of these three innocent children is highly affected and due to this act of the applicant-accused, their future might be difficult,” the court said. It further said, “Looking to the materials on hand, it also appears that the present applicant-accused fled from the spot of incident and did not stay at the place to see the pain of the injured including three innocent children who were sleeping. Therefore, the conduct of the applicant-accused is also required to be considered at this stage.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/parv-shah-denied-bail-in-hit-and-run-case/articleshow/85847184.cms||---

The complainant, Pritesh Patel, suffered multiple fractures and an FIR in the matter has been filed with Chandkheda police, and ACB officer said. A case under prevention of corruption act has also been filed against Priyadarshi, he added. According to case details, Priyadarshi had demanded Rs 4,000 as bribe to register Patel’s security agency under GST. After settling at Rs 3,000 Patel informed the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) who laid a trap for Priyadarshi at Visat petrol pump near Chandkheda. When Patel went to the petrol pump, Priyadarshi told him to sit inside his car, but he smelt a trap when Patel kept the door of the car open. He immediately shoved Patel to throw him outside the car and began driving at speed with the businessman being dragged around 400 metres on the busy road. When an ACB cop tried to stop Priyadarshi he hit the cop with his car, injuring him. Patel and the ACB cop were then rushed to Civil Hospital in Asarwa.

BJP executive committee member advocate Bikram Singh Sidhu, who has already filed a complaint against alleged malpractice in the recent auction, announced this in a press conference here. BJP district president Pushpinder Singhal said the party will stage protests outside LIT office and also gherao the residence of cabinet minister, who was involved in the scam. Sidhu, while citing the example of ‘City Centre scam’, alleged that whenever any fraud takes place in LIT, it happens during the Congress government tenure. “The 3.79 acre land in Model Town that was auctioned for Rs 98 crore has a market price of Rs 300 crore. Initially, there was a plan to construct 100 shop-cum-offices at this place and develop a food gallery. But the LIT chairman ignored it to benefit those close to him. Earlier, too, major chunks of land in BRS Nagar and Rajguru Nagar were sold at a nominal price. Land earmarked for a school and a community centre was also sold for commercial purposes. The LIT may sell a building on Rani Jhansi Road, which has a reserve price of Rs 200 crore, at a lesser rate,” he added. Singhal said, “We are going to stage a protest against the LIT chairman as we cannot let public properties be sold off like this. Earlier, too, we had protested against the LIT for trying to sell prime land at the rear of Maharaja Palace.”LIT chairman Raman Balasubramanium said he has already clarified on the issue and there was no malpractice involved. “The opposition is raking up the issue for vested interest,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/bjp-to-move-hc-if-govt-fails-to-act/articleshow/85844501.cms||---

The three-year-old project was completed at a cost of Rs 11.36 crore under the smart cities mission programme. Trial runs will help take corrective measures before the project is put to public use in the next 10 days. The civic body has utilised existing poles in 23 spots around the hillock after making minor modifications to position 108 LED floodlights (RGBA) to spotlight Rockfort in such a manner, that people from even a kilometre distance can witness the picturesque sight during the nights. A source said that the illumination can be viewed from Cauvery bridge, Chennai bypass, Big bazaar street, Andar street, Chathiram bus stand and Karur road localities. An official said that through the beautification project, the city’s landmark can have theme-based lightings on Independence Day, Republic Day and other special occasions. The facility is enabled with remote monitoring and management, which will enable senior officials to supervise them from their office through an online platform. “We will commission the project in 10 days,” corporation commissioner P M N Mujibur Rahuman told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/rockfort-illumination-project-over-corpn-holding-trial-runs/articleshow/85847164.cms||---
---||Pune||QR code helps 500 youths promise organs in slack year for donations||Pune: More youths are responding to organ donation by filing the QR code-based pledge, officials from the Zonal Transplant Coordination Committee (ZTCC), the apex organization that oversees the allocation of donated organs, said on Wednesday. The organization developed the QR code to reach out to people during the pandemic, spread awareness, and meet the huge gap in demand and supply. Prior to the pandemic, the ZTCC would register an average of 500 pledges every year. The number dropped to 50 pledges during the pandemic. But now, the number of donors filing the pledge has slowly started picking up ever since the ZTCC launched the QR code this June. “We have recorded 500 pledges ever since we launched the QR Code-based online organ donation pledge on June 21. The response from young people is growing,” liver transplant physician and secretary of Pune region ZTCC Sheetal Dhadphale Mahajani said. Residents from rural parts of Pune have also responded to the initiative. “Residents of Dhalewadi village in Purandar taluka have collectively pledged their organs using the QR code,” Aarti Gokhale, transplant coordinator, ZTCC Pune branch, said. By pledging, there is no force to donate organs. But when a person pledges, he talks about it to his family. This way, the family knows about organ donation, and at the time of death, they can make a decision easily, she added. “We hope to increase donor base through the QR code,” Gokhale said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/qr-code-helps-500-youths-promise-organs-in-slack-year-for-donations/articleshow/85847160.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Nagbhid police have arrested five people and booked them under various sections of IPC and Maharashtra Prevention and Eradication of Human Sacrifice and other Inhuman, Evil and Aghori Practices and Black Magic Act, 2013. The complaint was lodged by Indirabai, mother of Yashoda Kamte and Ashok Kamte. All three were thrashed by the accused. Investigations and arrests are still underway in the first case, where five dalits of two families were thrashed in Wani (Khurd) village of Jiwti tehsil for practising black magic. Nagbhid police said accused Pramod Sadmake, Sitaram Sadmake, Mayuri Sadmake, Mayuri’s mother (name not known) and Pilla Atram had charged one Ashok Kamte from village Mindala (Toli) of practicing back magic. They thrashed his sister Yashoda at her house on Tuesday afternoon. Ashok Kamte had gone to Nagbhid for some work at that time. Later, Pilla Atram and Pramod Sadmake tracked Ashok Kamte to Nagbhid and forcefully brought him on his bike to Mindhala. He was taken to the house of one Nikesh Sadmake, and tied to an iron pillar of public water tank. The accused then thrashed him with cricket bat and bamboo sticks mercilessly for hours. Kamte was seriously injured in the beating. When Ashok and Yashoda’s mother Indirabai Kamte (70) tried to intervene, she too was thrashed by the accused. As the victims did not have any means to lodge a complaint on the same day, Indirabai reached Nagbhid police station with her victim daughter Yashoda on Wednesday and filed a complaint. Based on the complaint, Nagbhid police registered offences under section 143, 147, 148, 149, 452, 324, 342, 363, 368, 323 of IPC and section 3(1)(2) of anti-superstition act against five accused. All the accused have been arrested. Nagbhid police have deployed police force at village Mindhala and situation is under control. SP Arvind Salve and SDPO Milind Shinde visited the village on Wednesday to take stock of the situation. SP Salve called upon the people not to believe in superstitions and maintain law and order. Two incidents of witch hunt within a week in the district has posed a challenge before the administration to tackle the superstitions prevailing in rural areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/3-thrashed-over-black-magic-allegations-in-nagbhid-tehsil/articleshow/85847187.cms||Mazhar Ali
---||Lucknow||Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences doctors perform Uttar Pradesh's first swap kidney transplant||LUCKNOW: In a landmark development that may cut the wait list for patients in need of kidney transplant, doctors at Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences conducted the state’s first swap renal transplant on Tuesday after two families agreed to the respective spouses donating a kidney to the other patient in exchange. The beneficiaries were 53-year-old Chitra from Azamgarh and 47-year-old Rohan of Lucknow, both patients of end stage renal disease (ESRD) in which transplant is the only hope. Chitra and old Rohan had been waiting for a donor. “In both cases, the spouses were willing to donate a kidney, but during tests the required matching was not achieved,” said Prof Narayan Prasad, head of nephrology department. The teams of nephrology and urology departments then zeroed in on swap renal transplantation. A new round of crossmatch tests with swapped donors — Rohan’s wife Aarti for Chitra and Chitra’s husband Ashok for Rohan — was launched and the desired parameters were found to be in sync. The option was explained to both couples along with the risk and benefits. Once their consent was achieved, the formalities of permissions under the Tissue and Human Organ Transplantation Act, amendment and rule of 2014 were initiated. Thereafter, clearance from anesthesia department team led by Prof Anil Agarwal, and including Prof Sanjay Dhiraj, Dr Divya Srivastava and Dr Rafat Shamim, was obtained and the procedure conducted on August 31. “Two teams comprising surgeons from the urology department, supported by anesthetists and para medical staff, were readied for simultaneous procedures. The extraction from donors and transplantation took nearly four hours. The patients were kept in post-operative ICU. When they were declared fine, we could break the good news,” said surgeon and head of urology department Prof Aneesh Srivastava, who was assisted by Dr MS Ansari, Dr Uday Pratap Singh and Dr Sanjay Sureka. SGPGI director Prof RK Dhiman said, “This beginning will make it easy for patients in need of transplant who lead a traumatic life waiting for a match. Some unfortunate ones even die in the wait. The swap transplant option will widen the pool of donors and eventually help in cutting the waiting list.” (Names of the patients have been changed on request)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sgpgi-docs-perform-states-first-swap-kidney-transplant/articleshow/85849644.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Trichy||Cops rescue 7 minors, arrest three traffickers at Trichy||Trichy: Railway protection force (RPF) personnel rescued seven minor boys and arrested three traffickers who accompanied them at the Trichy railway junction on Wednesday. The accused had brought the boys to Trichy for engaging them in construction business and confectionery shops. According to police, the boys aged between 13 and 16 along with three agents were caught by RPF personnel as they arrived in Trichy by Banaras Rameswaram festival special train on Tuesday evening. On noticing them, RPF police developed suspicion and conducted inquiries with them. The three agents were identified as Ramnath, 40, and S Sivpuja, 32, from Uttar Pradesh and Girwarilal Chouhan, 41, from Chhattisgarh. They had brought the boys to engage them as construction workers in Trichy and surrounding districts in the central region, police said. Subsequently, all the three have been handed over to Government Railway Police (GRP) who in turn booked them under various IPC sections and arrested them. Further inquiries were on. Police handed over the boys to child welfare committee (CWC). According to CWC authorities, child trafficking from states like Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and West Bengal is rampant. “The traffickers brought the minors by luring their parents with money. Due to their poor economic condition, they have no option but to accept the deal. The traffickers tell the minors what to say to the police if they are caught. They have to say they arrived here to visit their relatives working in Tamil Nadu,” an official said. He said district collector S Sivarasu has instructed officials from the concerned departments to take necessary action to check child trafficking.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/cops-rescue-7-minors-arrest-three-traffickers-at-trichy/articleshow/85847191.cms||---

---||Rajkot||Gujarat: Rains wash away Saurashtra farmers’ fears of crop failure||RAJKOT: Saurashtra finally received its bounty of rain after much waiting on Wednesday. It started to pour past midnight on Tuesday making fields and farmers brim with joy allaying fears of imminent crop failure. Skies literally opened up with a vengeance in Mangrol and Junagadh with Mangrol taluka receiving around 170 mm rain during the day on Wednesday and around 200mm rainfall on Tuesday night. Talala, Veraval, Una, Gir Somnath, Kaylapnur and Kahmbhaliya talukas of Devbhumi Dwarka districts and Rajula and Jafrabad talukas of Amreli districts received heavy rain along with Bhavnagar and Kutch districts too. The heavy rainfall resulted in massive flooding in the town and surrounding villages on Mangrol taluka, said sources. Maliya and Talala talukas reported getting 163mm rainfall each on Wednesday.

In Rajkot district, Gondal taluka received 100mm rainfall while other talukas of Saurahtra received around 50 to 100 mm rainfall during the day on Tuesday. Sources said that no news of any damage or loss of life or livestock has been received so far, but small rivers and ponds are filled with fresh water. Internal roads of villages of Gir Somnath districts had to be closed during the day because of water logging. According to sources, flood waters on Junagadh-Somnath highway slowed down traffic on this route, while the administration was busy clearing the road during the day. Gondal town of Rajkot district received significant rain during the day resulting in floods in the town. The underpass that connects the town with the national highway was blocked due to waterlogging leading to massive problems for stranded passengers after the state transport bus depot got flooded. The rain lashed Bhavnagar city during Monday night. The significant rain was reported in Mahuva, Ghogha and Gariyadhar talukas of the district. The rain also lashed in Anjar, Gandhidham and Abdasa talukas of Kutch. Rains also drenched Rajkot city since Tuesday night.

Waterlogging was also reported in several areas like 150-feet Ring road, Kalavad road, University road, Jawahar road and Yagnik road. Thanks to the current spell, Ahmedabad and Banaskantha are no longer in the “large deficient” category, but the rainfall there, along with 26 other districts, remains “deficient”.

Consumers have, however, objected to the deadline of January 1, 2022, within which they will have to apply for the subsidy and have demanded this be extended. Sources said the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, which is providing the subsidy from the Centre, has set a target of 25 MW solar panel installations in MSEDCL supply areas. The state power firm has a consumer base of over 2.6 crore across Maharashtra. Residential consumers can opt for a minimum 1 kilowatts peak (kWp) solar panel, which will generate 1,400-1,500 units annually.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-msedcl-offers-40-subsidy-on-solar-panels/articleshow/85849670.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Average Madhya Pradesh resident losing 2.9 years of life due to pollution: Study||NEW DELHI: India’s air pollution problem is now not just limited to the Indo-Gangetic plains, but has increased geographically as well, with states such as Maharashtra and MP seeing people lose an additional 2.5 to 2.9 years of life expectancy due to air pollution, the annual Air Quality Life Index report from the University of Chicago on Wednesday reveals. It finds people in north India are still the most hit by air pollution, with 510 million losing an average of 8.5 years of their life if 2019 pollution levels persisted. In terms of states, Delhi is still the most impacted, with the average person losing 9.7 years of life as compared to average life expectancyif WHO standards were being met, with UP in second (9.5 years). If Delhi was able to bring down pollution to the national standards, Delhiites would still stand to lose seven years of their life. The annual average for PM 2.5 is 40 micrograms per cubic metre. The study, which analysed air pollution data from 1998 until 2019, also finds that while Delhi overall ranks as the worst state, UP has the most polluted cities, with the PM 2.5 concentration in Allahabad and Lucknow 12 times the WHO guidelines. Residents of both these cities stand to lose on an average 11 years of their life. “During a truly unprecedented year where some people who are accustomed to breathing dirty air, experienced clean air, it became acutely apparent the important role policy has played and could play in reducing fossil fuels that contribute both to local air pollution and climate change,” said Michael Greenstone, the Milton Friedman Distinguished Service Professor in Economics and creator of the AQLI along with colleagues at the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC). ‘One of 3 schoolkids in Delhi has asthma’Nearly one out of every three schoolchildren in Delhi has asthma and airflow obstruction. In comparison, only 23% children living in cities like Kottayam and Mysuru, where there is less pollution compared to Delhi, have respiratory health issues, a group of experts has claimed this on the basis of study that assessed the respiratory health of school children in three cities – Delhi, Kottayam in Kerala and Mysuru in Karnataka– by using a questionnaire and lung function test. ‘South Asia is home to the most polluted countries on earth’The AQLI demonstrates the benefits these policies could bring to improve our health and lengthen our lives,” he added. The AQLI is a pollution index that translates particulate air pollution into the expected impact on life expectancy. Developed by the University of Chicago’s Milton Friedman Distinguished Service Professor in Economics Michael Greenstone and his team at the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC), it quantifies the causal relationship between long-term human exposure to air pollution and life expectancy by combining hyper-localised, global particulate measurements. The report states South Asia is home to the most polluted countries on earth, with Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan accounting for nearly a quarter of the global population and consistently ranking among the top five most polluted countries in the world. In 2019, India’s average particulate matter concentration was 70.3 μg/m  — the highest in the world and 7 times the WHO’s guideline of 10 μg/m  . “Air pollution shortens average Indian life expectancy by 5.9 years, relative to what it would be if the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline was met; 3 years relative to what it would be if pollution were reduced to meet the country’s own national standard. Some areas of India fare much worse than average, with air pollution shortening lives by 9.7 years in Delhi and 9.5 years in Uttar Pradesh,” the report said. Ken Lee, director of the AQLI said, “The bad news is that the greatest impacts of air pollution remain concentrated in South Asia. The good news is that governments in this region are recognising the severity of the problem and are now beginning to respond. The Government of India’s National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) is an important step towards cleaner air and longer lives, as is the establishment of the new Commission for Air Quality Management in the NCR,” Lee said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/avg-mp-resident-losing-2-9-yrs-of-life-due-to-pollution-study/articleshow/85847190.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

According to her, she likes physical classes more, as it will allow her to directly interact with teachers and clear doubts. She was one of the many studious students who wanted to get back to school for a comprehensive learning process. Academic activities resumed in private schools on the day itself and the focus was on recapping what was taught in online classes and clearing doubts. G Johnson, a teacher with Nirmala Matha Convent Matriculation School, Kuniamuthur, said, “We will be in a better position to access students’ learning process in offline classes and reopening of schools will help us address their weak areas.” Preparing the students for board exams would be a real challenge, said R Visalakshi, state president, Tamil Nadu Private School Association, referring to the long gap in conducting physical classes. “Moreover, we don’t know what the future holds and if the board exams will be held next year. We want the students to come to schools and get used to the atmosphere again. The focus will be on completing the syllabus.” The scenario was different in government schools, where teachers chose to go slow with academics on day one, as several students were not able to attend online classes regularly. S Rajalakshmi, headmistress, government model higher secondary school, Asokapuram, said 515 of the 575 students, who were called for physical classes, had turned up on Wednesday. “We asked the class teachers to give motivational speeches to the students to allay their fear of Covid-19. Instead of discussing academics, we discussed their career choices and how they should work towards achieving the same.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/private-schools-jump-start-academic-activities/articleshow/85847209.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Nagpur||ED action bears out mystery letter in March that listed Kharmate’s vast assets||Nagpur: A letter was widely circulated on social media in March, alleging that deputy RTO Bajrang Kharmate took bribes for managing postings of officials in the regional transport department across Maharashtra. Kharmate is now under the Enforcement Directorate (ED) scanner in a money laundering case registered against former state home minister Anil Deshmukh. The ED probe has traced all of Kharmate’s disproportionate assets, including those mentioned in the said letter. The 16-page letter addressed to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had listed Kharmate’s ill-gotten wealth, and claimed he pocketed around Rs150 crore by managing transfers of officials to choice postings in 2020 alone. The letter also mentioned the properties amassed by Kharmate, including a mall on Ahmednagar Road and two showrooms in Indore. Most of the properties were registered in the names of his wife, three sons, and his two brothers, the letter alleged. On Monday, the ED revealed that Kharmate ran three franchises of an electronic appliances company and two of a branded jewellery company in Pune in premises owned by him. Kharmate had at that time refuted the allegation. Even the then RTO Officers Association’s president and motor vehicle inspector R Kalamankar had filed a complaint against an unidentified person for circulating the letter. But the ED raids have exposed Kharmate. Kharmate is currently posted in Wardha as deputy RTO, which is under the jurisdiction of Nagpur city RTO. However, using his ‘influence’, Kharmate managed to get additional charge of Nagpur (rural) RTO. The letter had claimed that Kharmate was acting in collusion with transport minister Anil Parab. Kharmate was also allegedly involved in converting 1,000 technical posts created after a PIL in the high court, and instead recruited 700 inspectors and 300 assistant inspectors. “Without greasing Kharmate’s palm, no transfers and postings were happening in the transport department,” the letter had claimed. Official sources also alleged that due to his influence, the transport commissioner’s office in Mumbai had not filled up vacant posts of nine RTOs, including Nagpur rural, Nagpur city, Dhule, Kolhapur, Aurangabad, Panvel, Nashik, Mumbai West and Mumbai Central. These posts have been lying vacant for many months. The letter had also claimed that the transport department revenue has gone down by 65%, and over 8.49 lakh vehicles had not paid annual tax. There are around 10 lakh vehicles which pay annual tax to the transport department. Despite increasing manpower, the department had failed to increase revenue, it said. The letter alleged that even the work to construct driving test tracks (Rs150 crore project), vehicle inspection centres (Rs1,300 crore project) and construction of new buildings worth Rs500 crore too were not allotted to state’s public works department. It was alleged the transport department would entrust some private contractors for the projects. The letter also mentioned a case where a motor vehicle inspector posted in Nagpur city was caught issuing fitness certificate to a truck (MH40AT1212) detained at Khapa police station. A probe indicted him for wrongdoing, but his alleged proximity to Kharmate ensured there was action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ed-action-bears-out-mystery-letter-in-march-that-listed-kharmates-vast-assets/articleshow/85847244.cms||---
---||Meerut||Feted on I-Day, UP cop takes bribe 15 days later, gets caught||MEERUT: On Independence Day, inspector Vijenderpal Singh Rana turned up in his smartest uniform to receive UP Police's gallantry medal. Days later, on Wednesday, he was booked in his own thana, where he is posted as the SHO, for allegedly taking a bribe of Rs 1 lakh to let off a man with a stolen truck. A decorated officer, inspector Vijenderpal Rana was part of the police team -- led by the then SP Ajay Sahni -- that had shot dead Shiv Shakti Naidu, a dreaded gangster who had pulled off a sensational Rs 8 crore heist in Delhi’s Lajpat Nagar in 2014. Kingpin of the notorious Naidu gang, he was killed on February 18 last year during an encounter. Sahni and Vijenderpal Rana were awarded the Police Gallantry Medal for the encounter on August 15. Vijenderpal Rana’s downhill slide from being a celebrated cop to an “absconding accused” was quick; it took him just 15 days. Superintendent of police Vineet Bhatnagar said, "The inspector is wanted in the bribery case. He has not returned yet.” An FIR has been registered at Meerut’s Sadar police station. Gaurav Rana, acting SHO of the police station, told TOI that his predecessor and head constable Manmohan Singh have been booked under various sections of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. “We arrested the constable redhanded as he was taking a Rs 50,000- bribe from the scrap dealer with the truck. Inspector Rana had also taken a bribe of around Rs 1 lakh. The FIR was filed on the orders of the SSP,” the SHO added. Vijenderpal Rana had declared his police station “corruption free” a few days ago. He had even put up a board outside the thana asking visitors to report any incident of bribery. According to sources, the graft came to light when SP Bhatnagar noticed discrepancies in an FIR registered at Sadar police station regarding the theft of a truck. Important points were missing from it. Further investigation led the IPS officer to the alleged corruption case. “We had found that the SHO Sadar (Vijenderpal Rana) and a constable in his team were harassing a junk dealer," a senior police officer involved in the investigation said. "When we spoke to the man, he told us that the SHO and the constable were asking for money. To catch them red-handed, we asked the dealer to go to the constable’s home and give him Rs 50,000 as bribe. We nabbed the policeman there itself. The inspector is still missing though.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/up-cop-with-gallantry-medal-on-aug-15-booked-for-graft-on-sept-1/articleshow/85844607.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Jump in dengue hospitalisations in August, compared to July figures||MUMBAI: Dengue hospitalisations have seen a significant jump in August compared to July. BMC said over 132 people required hospitalisation after they were confirmed to have dengue. In July, 28 confirmed admissions were recorded. The actual hospitalisations could be higher as not all private admissions are notified. Most cases were reported from F south (Parel, Sewri, Naigaum), B (Dongri, Umarkhadi) and H west (Bandra, Khar and Santacruz (W), civic officials said. BMC said there were no deaths because of the mosquito-borne disease. Malaria admissions remained the same since July, when 787 cases were reported. In August, 790 cases were reported. Insecticide department said 13,15,373 houses were inspected, and 11,492 dengue breeding spots were destroyed. Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer, said the city usually registers a rise in dengue cases in August-September. She said people should not delay seeing a doctor if they have fever, headache, rashes, muscle pain and joint pain. Dr Abhishek Subhash, consultant (internal medicine) at Bhatia Hospital, said dengue was more than last year. Many patients having fever have dengue-like symptoms with low platelets. “Although dengue tests are coming out negative in many cases. But since symptoms and presentation are akin to dengue, we are treating patients accordingly,” he said. The doctor added that 50-60% of fever cases he has treated have turned out to be dengue. Doctors caution that the window for undergoing a dengue test was crucial too. A civic doctor said NS1 antigen test for dengue comes positive around 24 hours after onset of symptoms. There have been 3,338 malaria cases, 133 leptospirosis, 209 dengue, 1,848 gastroenteritis, 165 hepatitis and 45 H1N1 cases between January-August.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-jump-in-dengue-hospitalisations-in-aug-compared-to-july-figures/articleshow/85849706.cms||---

The deceased was identified as Karsan Chavda, a resident of Keshod town. Chavda was found hanging from a hook in the ceiling of the office of Gujarat Water Supply and Sewerage Board (GWSSB) in Keshod where he worked as a watchman. His body had started decomposing, said police. It is suspected that he may have ended his life two-three days ago during the festival holidays. According to police, Chavda went missing on August 28 and he was found dead on Wednesday. Police recovered a note from the room where Chavda’s body was found. It read, “Don't harass my family and office staff for my extreme step. I am sacrificing myself for the sake of Rabari, Bharwad and Charan communities as the government has been harassing students of these communities. I am giving my life for the sake of these communities.” However, Keshod police inspector N B Chauhan told TOI, “We have recorded statement of Rambhai Chavda, son of the deceased. He said that his father was suffering from hypertension, diabetes and psychological issues.” When asked about the content in Chavda’s note, Chauhan said, “The contents of the suicide note seem to be out of context.

The shop owned by Meyyappar and Raja, residents of Athur Palaniyappa Nagar, was functioning in a building located on Karur-Coimbatore main road. It was some motorists crossing the stretch who noticed smoke emanating from the shop around 12 am on Wednesday. Some of them tried to douse the fire by pouring water available around, but its intensity increased and soon engulfed the whole shop. Police and fire and rescue services personnel rushed to the spot and tried to put out the fire. The firefighters used three tanks full of water to bring the fire under control, but could not. Karur town police inspector Senthurapandiyan and his team arranged water from tanker lorry owners supplying drinking water. With the help of five such tanker lorries, the fire could be brought under control after 2 hours, police said. The fire gutted materials stocked at the shop including foam, rexin, plywood and electrical components worth Rs 50 lakh, according to the complaint lodged with police. Preliminary inquiries pointed to a short circuit as having caused the fire. Police have registered a case and commenced investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/auto-spare-parts-shop-gutted-in-fire/articleshow/85847238.cms||---

---||Noida||Noida man kills wife & kids, buries them in basement; held||NOIDA: More than three years after he allegedly killed his wife and two children as well as a friend to fake his own death, law finally caught up with a 34-year-old man, who was arrested on Wednesday. Police said after murdering his family in February 2018, Rakesh had buried the bodies of his wife Ratnesh (then 27) and children Avni (3) and Arpit (1) in the basement of their house in the Chipyana area of Bisrakh. He then allegedly killed his friend, Rajendra, in Kasganj’s Dholna area, dumped his body and threw his ID card near it to fake his own death. Rakesh allegedly committed the crimes only to pursue an affair, a UP Police constable. Later, Rakesh, along with his father — a retired head constable of UP Police — allegedly hatched the plot to feign his death and the father-son duo kept fooling the Kasganj and the GB Nagar cops for more than three years. While the family members of the deceased ran from pillar to post to search for their “missing daughter and grandchildren” and lodged a missing person’s complaint with Bisrakh police, Rakesh was living comfortably under a different name in various states and UTs, including Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab and UP. When police recovered a body from Kasganj’s Dholna area in April 2018, Rakesh’s father Banwarilal claimed that it was his son’s. However, residents of Dholna had identified the body to be that of Rajendra, a friend of Rakesh. “While Rajendra’s family identified his body and wanted to cremate it, Banwarilal claimed it was of his son. He had connived with his son to fake his death,” Bisrakh SHO Anita Chauhan told TOI. The case ran parallel with the missing person’s complaint of Rakesh’s wife and their two children. “The complaint was later converted into an FIR lodged under IPC 364 (kidnapping or abducting in order to murder),” she said. More than three years on, Kasganj police got crucial clues that Rakesh was staying under a fake name and arrested him on Wednesday. Banwarilal was caught too and the duo were brought to Chipyana area to trace where the bodies of the family members had been buried. After digging the basement of the house, three skeletons were recovered. They will be sent for DNA examination to confirm identities, Chauhan said. ACP-2 (central Noida) Yogendra Singh said a cemented wall had been built over the spot where the accused buried the bodies. “The woman with whom Rakesh has been involved belongs to Kasganj itself and the duo had been involved for the past few years,” a senior police officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/man-kills-wife-and-2-kids-buries-them-in-basement-held-after-three-years/articleshow/85849744.cms||Shikha Salaria
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Record 300 Mantralaya cadre staff reshuffled||MUMBAI: CM Uddhav Thackeray has reshuffled a record number of 300 Mantralaya cadre officials. The reshuffle includes promotion of assistant section officer to section officer, from section officer to undersecretary, and so on to deputy secretary and joint secretary. Several officers in Mantralaya had been camping in the same department for years and had come to wield more clout than not only the secretaries of the departments, but even the cabinet members. “They had become so powerful no cabinet member was able to shift them. After the MVA government came to power, it was brought to the notice of the administration. After prolonged thought, 300-odd Mantralaya cadre officials were reshuffled in consultation with the CM,” a senior official told TOI. In the past, former CMs like Devendra Fadnavis, and Prithviraj Chavan had made attempts to reshuffle the Mantralaya cadre officials, but did not succeed. “We hope all the transfer and promotion orders issued in the last two days are implemented. It will be a real testing time for the CM and the general administration department led by chief secretary Sitaram Kunte,” said the official. As per rules, a Mantralaya cadre officer can’t be shifted out of Mantralaya. In 1983, Shrikant Jichkar as minister of state for general administration had proposed shifting them to the field for better understanding of ground situations, but failed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-record-300-mantralaya-cadre-staff-reshuffled/articleshow/85849748.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar
---||Lucknow||Sustainable Dutch projects in UP help double farm income||Lucknow: From introducing sustainable methods in Uttar Pradesh’s dairy sector with an aim to double farm income to reducing water consumption and wastage in tanneries, the Netherlands government and expert organisations have been collaborating with UP in various sectors. On a two-day visit to Lucknow, Dutch ambassador to India, Marten van den Berg ,spoke exclusively to TOI on the current projects between the two countries and the future course of action. On dairy farmers:“Dutch farmers spent a year on ground in Kanpur to train UP’s farmers. We have successfully trained around 2,000 dairy farmers and 3,000 women farmers in UP to help them increase milk productivity and double income,” said Marten. After Dutch organisation Solidaridad’s interventions in the region, consumers can know the origin of the milk and its treatment process at the scan of a QR code. “Due to Covid, we also trained farmers on video from the Netherlands and they are now taking the training forward,” added economic counsellor Joost Geijer.  On waste to value:As a pilot project, the Netherlands is setting up ‘waste to energy’ power plants in Muzaffarnagar and Ghaziabad. A third could be in Pilibhit. The ambassador said the idea is to convert solid waste into energy and ancillary products such as paper and road tiles and make the project self-sustainable. After Uttar Pradesh as a pilot, the technology will be expanded to the rest of the country. On saving water:As part of the clean Ganga collaboration with the Indian government, Dutch organisations have been working with tanneries in Kanpur to use salt and enzymes to clean animal hide instead of using water. Waste from tanneries like sludge is being used to make tiles. Fleshing waste is converted to animal feed and the project has created “a potential saving of 82,500 litres of fresh water withdrawal everyday.” Work in the sugarcane sector has led to saving of 400 billion litres of water as certified by Indian Institute of Sugarcane Research, Lucknow. On the future role:A pilot project to construct a road by reusing onsite material is underway. A 20km stretch in Kanpur Dehat is ready as a demo and the process will be replicated across the country. “We are also working on conversion of farm waste into energy. Instead of burning stubble which is a pollution menace, we will be working on converting it to fuel or furniture,” said agriculture counsellor at the Dutch embassy Michiel van Erkel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sustainable-dutch-projects-in-up-help-double-farm-income/articleshow/85849711.cms||Yusra Husain
---||Salem||Colleges in Salem region record low turnout||Salem: Schools in Salem region, which comprises Namakkal, Dharmapuri, Krishnagiri, Salem and Erode districts, reopened to encouraging responses from students on Wednesday. However, colleges in these districts reported a low turnout on the day. Addressing the media, Salem collector S Karmegam, who inspected Salem Fort Girls’ Higher Secondary School, said the schools in the district had recorded 48% attendance on the day. Pointing out that there were 595 high and higher secondary schools in the district, he said among them were 295 government schools, 35 aided schools, 215 matriculation schools and 50 CBSE schools. “They together have a strength of 1.83 lakh students, including 92,397 boys and 90,985 girls.” The situation was quite the opposite in colleges. A professor with the Salem government arts and science college told TOI on condition of anonymity that only 346 of the 1320-odd students had turned up on day one. “The situation wasn’t any different in other colleges in the district.” The collector said he had instructed the school and college managements to allow only 50% students for physical classes. Karmegam said he had formed 73 teams to monitor educational institutions in the district and warned to strict action if the school or college managements fail to follow the government guidelines. Government school teachers at Karungalpalayam in Erode city, meanwhile, welcomed the students with roses. One of the teachers said the flowers were given to the students to make them comfortable. “They were coming to the school amidst the pandemic situation and they should feel free.” Dharmapuri collector S Divyadharshini said 353 schools, including 225 government schools, six aided schools and 122 private schools were opened in the district. Namakkal collector Shreya P Singh, Erode collector H Krishnanunni and Krishnagiri collector Jeyachandra Bhanu Reddy also inspected a few educational institutions in their districts on the day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/salem/colleges-in-salem-region-record-low-turnout/articleshow/85847312.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||PCCF nod to capture problem tiger of Halda, operation begins||Chandrapur: PCCF (wildlife) Sunil Limye has granted permission for capturing problem tiger of Halda, which is responsible for three human kills. CCF, Chandrapur, NR Pravin will be heading the operation to be carried out by the rapid response team of Tadoba. The problem tiger has so far killed three persons in the area around Halda beat in South Bramhapuri forest range in the last three months. The victims belonged to Vandra, Halda and Padmapur villages located close to each other. With the predator population increasing to 224 — 114 tigers and 110 leopards— Bramhapuri has become a hub for man-animal conflict. Terrified villagers were looking up to politicians and forest department for help. Guardian minister Vijay Wadettiwar, who is MLA from Bramhapuri constituency, held a special meeting with top forest officials to deal with the problem. Local foresters identified the problem tiger with the help of camera trap pictures taken at the three spots of human kills. After local advisory committee approved capturing of the tiger, a proposal was sent to PCCF (wildlife) for approval. CCF Pravin told TOI that the order from PCCF granting permission to capture the problem tiger reached them on Tuesday. “A team headed by veterinary wildlife officer Dr Ravikant Khobragade has been deputed for the mission,” he said. According to experts, rescue operations during the rainy season are quite difficult to execute. The jungle is dense and visibility through the forest is very low during monsoon. Moreover, the internal roads are not accessible by vehicles and hence the rescue team often has to move on foot. With plenty of water available across the jungle, tracking the location of target predator becomes tough, they said. While agreeing with them, CCF Pravin claimed that PCCF has granted period of one month to capture the tiger. “If required, we can always seek extension to continue the operation,” he said. Meanwhile, local foresters have started search and tracking operation to trace the location of the problem tiger in the forest. The rescue team is likely to move in the forest in the next couple of days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/pccf-nod-to-capture-problem-tiger-of-halda-operation-begins/articleshow/85847314.cms||Mazhar Ali

While quashing the PASA order against Botad’s Jagdishbhai Maheta, Justice Paresh Upadhyay expressed his displeasure at the silence maintained by the state government to the HC’s specific question, “Whether the object of enacting the Gujarat Land Grabbing (Prohibition) Act, 2020, is really achieved or it turns out to be abuse of law on the ground, when based on that offence, detention under PASA is also ordered.” While the HC posed the query to the state home department, Botad’s district collector filed a reply in this regard. The court said, “The state is silent on this point. This is taken note of.” It quashed the PASA order saying that it is unsustainable and needs to be quashed as Maheta was dubbed as ‘property grabber’. In this case, Maheta was one of the visitors to the real tenant, and his visits were not approved by the landlord, who wanted them to vacate his houses. He later lodged an FIR against Maheta and four others under the anti-land grabbing laws. The district authority even booked Maheta under PASA in July, but the high court immediately stayed the detention order. The HC was furious with the authorities for resorting to the practice of invoking anti-land grabbing laws to vacate rented properties. The court had orally observed that small causes courts are replete with cases regarding disputes between landlords and tenants. Such practice of invoking PASA against reluctant tenants would end all civil litigations and aggrieved landlords would resort to the land grabbing laws.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/govt-silent-on-hc-query/articleshow/85847302.cms||---

---||Delhi||Swim Or Sink... From CP To Sadar, Traders Wade Into Troubled Waters||New Delhi: It was unusual to see staff bailing out water from the shops in Connaught Place on Wednesday morning and making poor progress. Some could be seen making arrangements to prevent rainwater from entering the stores but failing miserably. Establishments closer to Panchkuian Road were especially affected. “Looking at the waterlogged common areas, parking lots and shops, would you think we were in the heart of Delhi?” asked Atul Bhargava, president, New Delhi Traders’ Association. “The level of the roads is higher than the shop floors and so the rainwater flowed into the stores. Vehicular movement made things even more painful for us.” Bhargava said that New Delhi Municipal Council provided assistance, but wondered about the damage the water had done to stocks and shop fittings. “The drainage system, boosted just prior to the 2010 Commonwealth Games, isn’t good enough to meet the requirements of the market. We have been requesting the civic authorities to look into this time and again,” said Bhargava. When a well organised shopping centre like Connaught Place was so adversely affected, other markets perhaps could have expected no respite. And so it was. Most lanes in Sadar Bazar were inundated, shop owners had to load their stocks in rickshaws/tempos and rush them away from rooms that were filling up with rainwater. “We suffered big losses in the pandemic and now we are almost penniless due to lapses in civic management,” grumbled Rajendra Sharma, general secretary, Federation of Sadar Bazar Traders. “After rainwater entered the shops, we have been busy since morning shifting our stocks, even from shops constructed four feet above the road. With the roads already flooded, we couldn’t even pump out the water till late afternoon.” Being a low-lying area, Sadar Bazar collected runoff from Pahari Dhiraj and Qutub Road. What added to the problem, according to Sharma, were the newly laid sewer lines. Apparently, they have smaller diameter than the old lines and couldn’t cope with the rainwater. “The problem will not be resolved permanently until concrete action is taken by the area MLA and Delhi government,” said area municipal councillor Jai Prakash. Kamla Nagar had hoped for relief after the north corporation addressed the waterlogging problems last month. “It was like a river, with cars partially submerged in the water,” said Nitin Gupta, president of the market association there. “We waited helplessly for the water to recede. Unless the drainage capacity is increased, the problem will continue.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/swim-or-sink-from-cp-to-sadar-traders-wade-into-troubled-waters/articleshow/85849825.cms||Vibha Sharma

Unlike pre-Covid time, schools have not made it mandatory even to reach the school on time. Schools said that they will allowed it for next couple of days as buses are not running and campuses have just reopened. Government schools conducted classes from 10.30am. However, several students were seen entering the school even around noon. “Several students are reaching the classes late.

Strict timing rules will be followed gradually,” said DEO Bhopal, Nitin Tripathi. Same was the situation in private schools. “Schools are opened to boost the confidence of the students. We have given them free school timings to attend classes. If they reach school late, we will low them to attend classes,” said vice-president of MP Association of Unaided Private Schools, Vinny Raj Modi.

Days later, on Wednesday, he was booked in his own thana, where he is posted as the SHO, for allegedly taking a bribe of Rs 1 lakh to let off a man with a stolen truck. A decorated officer, inspector Vijenderpal Rana was part of the police team — led by the then SP Ajay Sahni — that had shot dead Shiv Shakti Naidu, a dreaded gangster who had pulled off a sensational Rs 8 crore heist in Delhi’s Lajpat Nagar in 2014. Kingpin of the notorious Naidu gang, he was killed on February 18 last year during an encounter. Sahni and Vijenderpal Rana were awarded the Police Gallantry Medal for the encounter on August 15. Rana declared his thana was free from graftVijenderpal Rana’s downhill slide from being a celebrated cop to an “absconding accused” was quick; it took him just 15 days. SP Vineet Bhatnagar said, “The inspector is wanted in the bribery case. He hasn’t returned yet.” An FIR has been registered at Meerut’s Sadar police station. Gaurav Rana, acting SHO of the police station, told TOI that his predecessor and head constable Manmohan Singh have been booked under Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. “We arrested the constable redhanded as he was taking a Rs 50,000 bribe from the scrap dealer with the truck. Rana had also taken a bribe of around Rs 1 lakh. The FIR was filed on orders of the SSP,” the SHO said. Vijenderpal Rana had declared his police station “corruption free” a few days ago. He had even put up a board outside the thana asking visitors to report any incident of bribery. According to sources, the graft came to light when SP Bhatnagar noticed discrepancies in an FIR registered at Sadar police station regarding the theft of a truck. Important points were missing from it. Further investigation led the IPS officer to the alleged corruption case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/up-cop-booked-for-graft-2-weeks-after-getting-medal/articleshow/85853552.cms||Ishita Mishra

In the latest achievement, Thakkar (33) won the first prize for best elephant click in a photography competition organized by the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun, to observe World Elephant Day, on August 12. The award comprises a trophy and a certificate. Thakkar told TOI that the photograph of two sub-adult elephants comforting each other by making sympathetic noises and touching their trunks to each other’s mouths was captured in Dhikala forest range during his visit to Corbett Tiger Reserve in 2018. “The herd had 40 elephants,” he said. “There are very few names who are deeply involved in elephant photography. You need to understand their behaviour and psychology to get better pictures. I visit Dhikala at least three or four times in a year,” he said. With not many people visiting parks for the last two years due to the pandemic, several such competition organizers have been flexible about allowing even old images. “The theme of the WII contest was ‘Elephants in action’ and my picture of delicate maneuvers by two tuskers was the perfect choice, it seems,” said Thakkar. Disillusioned by tiger photography, which has been confined more to social media over the years, Thakkar wanted to do something different and hence shifted to elephant photography 11 years ago. Of the 32 recognized awards which Thakkar has bagged, half of them have been for elephant photography. These include six from competitions in Germany, Korea, France, China, UK and Australia, and four in the prestigious ‘Nature in Focus’ contest organized in Bengaluru. According to Thakkar, social media has ruined the excitement in photographing tigers. “By the time I could post pictures, it would have gone viral. Secondly, there is too much overcrowding in the parks which deter people engaged in serious photography,” he said. For the last seven years, he has not visited parks in Central India. “Firstly, tiger tourism has become costly and secondly there is a mad rush. I have fallen in love with elephants and hence when I sight a tiger in Corbett, I alert other tourists and move in search of tuskers, so that I can coolly photograph them,” said Thakkar. He has expanded his passion to the Himalayan region. He visited Sikkim in 2018 to picture Tibetan sand fox and argali, the mountain wild sheep, which are only found in Sikkim.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/love-for-elephants-earns-city-lensman-wii-award/articleshow/85847387.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

August was mostly dry for the city with barely a few days reporting significant rain activity. Between Tuesday and Wednesday there were overnight heavy rain spells recorded in many areas. Adjoining areas of Mumbai, like Dahanu, also recorded 100mm-plus of rainfall. While brief showers have been forecast for the coming days, heavy rainfall is likely to pick up pace next week, said weather bureau officials. In a related development, lakes that supply water to the city have nearly 90% of the required water stock in them. In the 24 hours ending 8.30 am on Wednesday, the IMD’s Santacruz observatory recorded 108.4mm of rainfall while the Colaba observatory recorded 57.2mm of rainfall. The rain recorded by the Santacruz observatory falls in the ‘heavy rain’ category (64.5mm-115.5mm). The Colaba observatory recorded 57.2mm of rainfall which falls in the ‘moderate rain’ category (15.6mm to 64.4mm). On Wednesday, there was light rain recorded in the city and suburbs with the Colaba observatory recording 6.4mm of rainfall while Santacruz recorded 1.2mm of rainfall. The IMD has forecast ‘light to moderate’ rainfall from September 2-5. A warning for fishermen is still in place, said the IMD owing to squally weather conditions and fishermen from north Maharashtra have been advised not to venture into the sea. The maximum temperature in the city remained normal owing to the rainfall which had cooled down the city. On Wednesday maximum temperature recorded by the Colaba observatory was 29.6 degrees while the Met’s Santacruz observatory recorded maximum temperatures of 30.7 degrees. The water stock in lakes supplying Mumbai’s needs as on Wednesday stood at 12.93 lakh million litres or 89.35%. Last year on the same date, the total water stocks stood at 97%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/sept-begins-on-rainy-note-after-dry-spell-in-aug-in-mumbai/articleshow/85849787.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Mumbai||To stop Mumbai from sinking, govt to set up CM-led panel on climate change||MUMBAI: The state cabinet was on Wednesday presented with the global warming report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, with an overall focus on Maharashtra and an emphasis on its coastal belt, particularly Mumbai. Calling for mitigating measures, the environment department, while making the presentation, reiterated that if temperatures rise by 2-2.5 degrees Celsius on account of climate change, the city and the state will be among the world’s worst-affected spots. “The cabinet appreciates the need for quick action and places on record the urgency to get going on a carbon-neutral plan,” said Manisha Mhaiskar, principal secretary, environment. “It has been decided to set up a council of ministers for climate change, headed by the chief minister, and co-chaired by the deputy chief minister. We have identified five sectors where a time-bound climate action plan needs to be initiated if we are to reduce the impact of climate change.” The department warned that if one continues with “business as usual” then Mumbai and other coastal areas face the prospect of submergence, and central Maharashtra of severe drought. It said that forests, instead of acting as carbon sinks, will burn due to fires. The presentation also warned of ‘wet bulb temperature’ (temperature read by a thermometer covered in water-soaked cloth — wet-bulb thermometer — over which air is passed) being severely damaging to Mumbai. A wet bulb temperature reaches the surrounding temperature when humidity is 100% and water does not provide any cooling, resulting in heat strokes among living beings; this can cause a large number of deaths, comparable to that caused by earthquakes or epidemics. The presentation pointed out that the impact of climate change was already being felt locally: Mumbai and neighbouring areas experienced two cyclones in quick succession (Nisarga in 2020 and Tauktae in 2021). It also said that because of extreme rainfall, landslides are becoming a regular event. The department mentioned initiatives the government has taken to lower the rate of temperature rise, among which are the conservation of Aarey forest and the restoration of mangroves as steps towards protecting and creating carbon sinks. Five sectors identified as major contributors to the carbon footprint include energy (50%), industry and transport (15% each), and agriculture and urbanisation (10% each). Mhaiskar said the minister of the department concerned will head the preparation of a plan and provide details of fund allocation for implementation. The plan will then be placed before the council.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-to-stop-city-from-sinking-govt-to-set-up-cm-led-panel-on-climate-change/articleshow/85849791.cms||Clara Lewis

Parents said that they can’t take risk for their children in such a situation. “I have told the school of my kid to take the fee but I am not sending my child to school till he gets vaccinated. As there is no vaccination of people below 18 years yet, I can’t take the risk,” said Rajeev Batham, father of a class 7 student. Presence of students remained poor in both government as well as private schools. Most parents outrightly said no to sending their kids to school for campus academics amid talks of third Covid wave. “Fear of the third wave is still there. How can we send our children to school now. Online classes are on and there is no need to send them for offline classes,” said a parent, Adarsh Gupta. Parents even praised online classes. “Both teachers and students are comfortable in online classes. In such a situation I do not find any reason to send children for offline classes,” said another parent, Ashok Shrivastava. Schools also admitted that parents are preferring online classes. “Students won’t come in proper strength till online classes are available for them. We have raised the issue several times earlier. Offline classes will be a success only when online classes are closed,” said a school-owner without quoting his name.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/safety-concerns-parents-prefer-online-classes/articleshow/85847342.cms||---

Most of the schools could not restart the transport facility. Schools said that they are not in a position to start the facility before September 5 due to non-availability of the drivers. After the first lockdown was imposed, several schools could not pay their salaries due to which they left the job. Later, many drivers and helpers switched the profession. Now, schools are trying to call them back. “It is too early to join the schools again. I had seen worst phase of my life when I was denied the monthly pay. Somehow, I managed to get a job elsewhere. Now the school wants me to come back. In such a situation, I need to ensured by the schools that they will not throw me out again after resuming the work,” said a driver seeking anonymity. Several drivers are even demanding their pending arrears. “They have to clear my dues first if they want me to join back,” said another driver. Then non-availability of buses too is troubling schools. Unmaintained, many buses are not plying now. “Several schools even sold their buses over the months. Providing transport facility is a big challenge now,” said a school owner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/no-buses-or-drivers-transport-facility-fails-to-kick-off-in-most-schools/articleshow/85847322.cms||---
---||Pune||Pimpri man loses Rs 28 lakh to ‘Japanese firm’ commission lure||PUNE: A Pimpri resident (39) on Tuesday lodged a police complaint stating that unidentified callers, who posed as executives of a Japanese multinational pharma company, duped him of Rs28 lakh after offering him a commission for supply of minerals from a firm in Meghalaya. In June, the callers had convinced him to transfer the money for taking forward the deal, but stopped communicating with him after receiving the amount. The man, who works with a Swedish multinational industrial firm, had forwarded a complaint application to the cyber police. Following a verification, an FIR was registered with the Pimpri police. A Pimpri police officer said on June 3, the complainant had received a message on a social media platform from a man, who identified himself as an executive director of a pharmaceutical company from Japan. “The person told the complainant that the company is into health technology and wanted to start an office in India for buying minerals. He offered the complainant to work with the firm in India,” the officer said. He said the complainant accepted the offer. “After some days, a woman contacted the complainant and told him that the company had decided to buy xanthocomite mineral from a firm in Meghalaya. She urged the complainant to act as a mediator and finalise the deal worth Rs4.5 crore,” he said. “He was also lured of the seven per cent commission on that deal. They sent him an ‘MOU’ of the deal,” he said. The officer said the fraudsters took money from the complainant under the pretext of making purchases or payment of different charges. “Till June 23, the complainant transferred Rs29lakh to three bank accounts. When he refused to pay more money, the suspects stopped answering his calls,” the police officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/man-loses-rs-28l-to-japanese-firm-commission-lure/articleshow/85847373.cms||Mihir Tanksale

The man was rushed to the government hospital where doctors said no surgery could be performed to fix the tongue as the tissues were damaged. Police identified the man as V Murugesan, of Vasanth Nagar in the district. An inquiry with his family members revealed that Murugesan did not have any job for the past few days because of the pandemic. “Since he was not employed regularly, he suffered from depression.

---||Rajkot||Amul may acquire private land for proposed plant at Rajkot||RAJKOT: The proposed plant of Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF) in Rajkot is facing troubles because of want of land. The dairy giant has rejected a piece of 100-acre land that was identified by Rajkot collectorate near Anandpar because of its high price. GCMMF has demanded another piece of land. The federation’s total budget for the proposed plant is around Rs 500 crore. Sources said that the 100-acre land offered by the Rajkot collectorate in revenue survey numbers of Anandpar, Navagam and Sokhda villages on Ahmedabad highway costs around Rs 2.75 crore per acre. Amul has sought 100-acre land to install a milk processing plant with capacity of 30 lakh litre per day (LLPD). “The plant and machinery cost is expected to cross Rs 300 crore so we need land at cheaper rate. We have asked the government to identify land on Bhavnagar road. If we do not find the government rate affordable, we will acquire private land,” GCMMF’s vice chairman Valamji Humbal told TOI. Rajkot is a strategic location for a plant for milk coming from all districts of Saurashtra. Currently, around 30 LLPD from Saurashtra and Kutch is sent to Amul’s Gandhinagar plant where milk products like srikhand, chocolate, cheese and butter are manufactured. The Gandhinagar plant has capacity to process 50 LLPD. “But milk procurement will increase to 60 LLPD during peak season of winter. We are doing everything to take surplus milk. But after one more season, if we won’t be able to commence our Rajkot plant, we will be forced to declare milk holiday for a day during peak winter. It will result in heavy loss to milk producers,” he said. A day’s milk holiday would cost loss of around Rs 12 crore to milk producers in the region. Transportation cost is Rs 30 lakh a day GCMMF currently spends Rs 30 lakh per day for the transporting surplus milk from various parts of Saurashtra to Gandhinagar. This cost will be saved and the milk collection from this region will be increased once Rajkot plant commences operation. The time consumed in transportation of milk will also reduce. Milk collected from every location of Saurashtra travels around 300 km before reaching Gandhinagar plant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/amul-may-acquire-pvt-land-for-proposed-plant-at-rajkot/articleshow/85844716.cms||---

A native of Banda’s Pachokhar village in Tindwari town, Ram Bahadur was suffering from a psychological disorder and had illegally crossed over to Pakistan, police said. He was arrested on suspicion that he was an Indian spy and was released on August 30. He was handed over to the Punjab authorities, said senior police officials on Wednesday. Speaking to the media, his family members thanked the government for bringing him back to India. After Ram Bahadur went missing in 2009, his family members lodged a complaint with the Tindwari police station. A case was registered in this regard and as efforts were on to trace him, the family came to know in January 2021 that he was detained in Pakistan. His father Gilla Prajapati told reporters that Ram Bahadur was mentally unsound and went missing some 12 years ago. “We had searched, but couldn’t find him. We presumed him dead in some accident, and we did not have even the slightest of inkling that he crossed the border and reached Pakistan and was imprisoned there,” said Prajapati. His younger brother Maiku said that Ram Bahadur was the eldest of the two brothers. Village head Santosh Kumar said detailed information about Ram Bahadur has been made available to the district administration. “On Tuesday, Lekhpal Khushbu Gupta reached Ram Bahadur’s house and got him identified through video calling. Later, Amritsar administration and Army officers interacted with Ram Bahadur’s father Gilla Prajapati and mother Kusuma,” said village head Santosh Kumar. “Pakistani authorities had released him on Monday. He reached India via Attari. However, he has been kept in the hospital in Amritsar, Punjab.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/banda-resident-returns-after-spending-12-yrs-in-pak-prison/articleshow/85849781.cms||---

The demonstration was planned from municipal market to the municipal office. However, police stopped the demonstration midway near Ooty Coffee House on Commercial Road. They were lodged at a marriage hall. The protesters included members of Manitha Neya Makkal Katchi, besides merchants of the municipal market. They demanded reopening of the sealed shops in the municipal market and act against the municipal authorities. They also wanted the government to reconsider the revision of rent made in 2016. The municipal authorities sealed 850 shops located within the market and a few outside the market on August 25. As many as 1,395 shops in the market and outside, belonging to the Ooty municipality, failed to pay the revised enhanced rent for the past five years. Of the 1,395 shops, only a few of them have paid the enhanced rent that too partly. “We have lost business for eight days since the shops were sealed. Municipal officials sealed our shops without any prior notice,” a merchant said, adding, “Manitha Neya Makkal Katchi is holding the demonstration in support of us.” The protesters were let off in the evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/426-people-detained-for-trying-to-take-out-demonstration/articleshow/85847359.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||With Odisha FC, we found someone who Watford can align with: Paul O’Brien||Panaji: Odisha FC’s partnership with Watford FC got Premier League players talking about India, almost instantly. Tom Cleverly, Ben Foster and Moussa Sissoko were all doing media duties when Watford’s three-year international club partnership with Odisha was announced, late on Thursday. Not surprisingly, the stars wanted to know more. “They were really excited about the possibilities,” said Richard Walker, head of communications and media relations at Watford. “They were trying to find out more about Indian culture and Odisha, not just the club but state as well, and quite how impactful this partnership could be. They were really enthralled by what they learnt about Odisha and its ambition to become a big name in the ISL.” Odisha haven’t had the success they were looking for in the Indian Super League. They finished at the bottom of the ladder last season, winning just two of their 20 league matches. This season, though, the Bhubaneswar-based side has done things differently. They got Spain’s World Cup-winning forward David Villa on board and then surprised many with a couple of ambitious signings. The Watford partnership is an added incentive. “Last season wasn’t great, nobody is proud of it, but this season, with the partnership with Watford and the work that we’ve been doing on the field, everybody’s very optimistic,” said Abhik Chatterjee, head of football operations at Odisha. “Our main motive this season is to ensure that anybody who’s looking at Odisha FC from the outside, sees it as an exciting brand to get associated with. Players looking at Odisha FC should think, I can join this club and there’s an opportunity for me maybe to go to Watford to train there,” said Chatterjee. The results won’t come overnight, neither on the field, nor off it. And Odisha are ready to wait, just like they did to find the right partner to move ahead. “Partnerships are about having the right club, about the substance and not the badge. That’s why we went to Watford,” explained club president Raj Athwal. Paul O’Brien, Watford’s commercial director, said it wasn’t difficult to get a partnership between Indian and Premier League clubs, but finding the right partner was challenging. “It’s difficult to get a true partnership, difficult to align our values together, and that’s what we got very fortunate with Odisha that we found someone we could align with. We had other opportunities, but those weren’t right for us,” said O’Brien. Rohan Shukla, international marketing officer for Watford, knocked on the doors of several ISL clubs, trying to explain that they wanted to do “something very different” and not similar to what was being done in the past. Not many were convinced. “We were trying to explain to ISL clubs that we are catering towards, not just getting into India, creating a fan base and leaving as quickly as you can, but actually staying there and making a difference. To be able to convince people, it was very time consuming. Constant meetings were held with different clubs for this purpose. “Odisha understood the vision very clearly as to how we were going to be very different. There is something which is unique in its way, but will help develop Indian football going ahead. It was very difficult to convince people, but when the right team, which is Odisha FC here, was on board, it was very easy because the conversation changed from trying to convince people to how we can go about this and make a difference towards Indian football,” said Shukla.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/with-odisha-fc-we-found-someone-who-watford-can-align-with-paul-obrien/articleshow/85879895.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

Sharma said that he then called the police control room and the cops took him and the patients’ relatives to the police station. He stated that he was attacked by Rajput’s relative Deepak, 32, and Pathan’s relative Fazalkhan, 18. Sharma said the two men used sticks to beat him.Later in the day, Congress councillor Iqbal Shaikh sent a letter to municipal commissioner Mukesh Kumar demanding that action be taken against the security agency whose personnel attacked the patients’ relatives.

The apex power utility has also floated draft bid documents for the procurement of power and has sought views and comments from the interested stakeholders. According to GUVNL, the power will be procured from the thermal power plants — existing and new — set up on design, build, finance, own and operate (DBFOO) basis. For power generation, these plants use coal allocated under the Union government’s Shakti (Scheme for Harnessing and Allocating Koyala Transparently in India) policy. GUVNL intends to invite bids after obtaining Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission’s (GERC) approval to the draft bid document. “Gujarat will start getting coal under Shakti scheme by 2023. Hence, the commencement of power supply would tentatively begin from September 2023,” said sources. The contract period for the power supply will be 15 years and the date of registration and process for submission of bids will be intimated by GUVNL separately once the state-run company secures GERC’s approval to the bid documents, GUVNL said in a notice. GUVNL plans to invite bids for procurement of electricity from the thermal power plants after almost a decade. It had last sought bids from thermal power producers in 2010, added sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/guvnl-to-procure-3000mw-power-on-long-term-basis/articleshow/85835410.cms||---

---||Mumbai||P305 accused ignored messages for help: Chargesheet||MUMBAI: The police have filed a chargesheet against 11 persons and a company in the sinking of accommodation barge P305 during cyclone Tautkae on May 17. The chargesheet stated that the accused, who were associated with several companies, did not respond to emails and WhatsApp messages for help, causing the mishap. The 1,658-page chargesheet stated that lives could have been saved had action been taken on time and the stranded crew would have been rescued. Those chargesheeted named deceased P305 captain Rakesh Ballav and Nirankar Biswas, an Afcons company representative who was on board and died when the barge sank. Paapa Shipping director Nitin Singh, technical superintendent Akhileshwar Tiwari and manager Prasad Rane, who are all behind bars, were named in the chargesheet filed at the Ballard Pier court. The chargesheet lists 151 witnesses. “All the accused were well aware about the cyclone and knew that keeping the crew on board was dangerous. Moreover, no tug was sent to remove the barge to a safer place,” an officer said, citing the contents of the chargesheet, which was filed on August 30. A team supervised by DCP Ganesh Shinde and led by senior inspector Suhas Hemade is investigating the case. The police attached a copy of an email sent by Sachendra Singh (59), an Indian Register of Shipping (IRS) officer who was on board on behalf of the ONGC at the time of the mishap. “On May 14, Singh had sent an email to ONGC, Afcons, Certified Engineers India Limited (CEIL) and IRS. In the mail, he alerted these companies about the cyclone. Citing the Disturbance 2 report, sent by a company, Storm Geo, Singh stated that the wind speed would be 40 to 50 knots while the sea wave could be seven to nine metres. After explaining this, Singh stated that Ballav had stated that he needed sufficient help to move the barge. The accused did not act on the mail,” a police officer said. Singh drowned and his body was later found. The police attached a WhatsApp message sent by a CEIL engineer, Saurav Jain, to his office. He had stated that six anchors of the barge had broken and it was on two anchors only. “Jain in his message wrote that it all was happening due to the barge master’s overconfidence and lack of interest of companies towards lives of people,” the officer said, adding that Jain was still missing. Among the wanted accused in the chargesheet are two directors of Paapa shipping, Afcons project manager, a VP (onshore/offshore operations) and a marine operation head.

---||Rajkot||Want to remain young? Try this fish-scale, seaweed rub||RAJKOT: India’s cosmetics market stood at $13191.23 million in FY2020 and is stated to grow at double digit to reach $28985.33 million in FY2026. And why not? Beauty is serious business and to stay young or ‘sada jawan’ is every heart’s evergreen desire. To board this ‘beautyship’, Veraval-based CIFT (Central Institute of Fisheries Technology) too has come up with its own concoction that will help skin trap its youthfulness. Collagen extracted from fish scale mixed with seaweed extract — a cosmetic product prepared by using these two marine products — vows to give the beauty market a revolutionary makeover it has been dying to get. Scientists at CIFT claim that the marine face-pack is capable of decreasing wrinkles on the human face and is considered to have anti-ageing properties. According to the scientists the wrinkles start on skin as with the ageing the skin produces less proteins and collagen which makes human skin less resistant to environmental exposure. “This facepack once applied on the face, will start glowing and it will decrease wrinkles on the face so no one can presume your age by your face. Collagen-based products are rarely available in India. The difference of our product from other cosmetic products available in the market is that this one is free of harmful paraben preservatives and is available at a much cheaper cost,” CIFT scientist Ashish Kumar Jha told TOI. The scientific community has been working on fish collegian for years and its benefits are proven through various researches worldwide. It has many pharmaceutical and cosmetic uses. CIFT has also added seaweed extract which also has an immense role in the cosmetic industry. “We have tried it with different percentages and then skin consistency,” said Jha, adding that most of the cosmetic companies in India are using animal extract for natural cosmetics. CIFT has transferred this technology to a Porbandar-based collagen producing company, Amar Aquatic, on Saturday for commercial production. The company is one of the two companies of Gujarat that extract fish collagen from the catch at Veraval, Porbandar, Mangrol, Okha and Dwarka and export it in huge quantities to countries like South Korea, Thailand, Japan and a few western countries. These countries use the powder either in edible form or in various pharmaceutical and cosmetic products. Udayraj Mishra, director of Amar Aquatic said, “After a certain age, the human body stops making amino acids naturally or the process slows down. This is a special product which has the capacity to restart the process of making amino acids in the body. The gel we are going to make will show visible effect on the skin after 10 minutes of application and will stay effective for a minimum of three months.” According to Mishra, the products available in the market now are made of animal extract, while this will be the first product in the country to be made of marine collagen. It is 1.5 to 10-times more effective because it has low molecular weight and will also restart the collagen-making process in the body, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/want-to-remain-young-try-this-fish-scale-seaweed-rub/articleshow/85844822.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya
---||Kochi||Kerala: Woman and her two minor children die of burn injuries in Thuravoor||KOCHI: In a tragic incident, a mother and two of her children died of burn injuries reportedly after the mother attempted self-immolation on Wednesday. The woman’s husband had died over a month ago due to cardiac arrest and she was quite depressed ever since his death, police said. The deceased are identified as Anju Anoop, 31, of Elamthuruthy House at Thuravoor near Angamaly, her daughter Ardra, 6, and son Aarush, 3. The woman was found with burn injuries along with her children at around 2.30pm at her home in Thuravoor. She had been staying with her mother-inlaw and husband’s brother at the house. According to police, prima facie it seemed like the mother had poured kerosene over herself and the children before setting fire in a room bolted from inside. The children seemed to have died on the spot and they were declared brought dead at a private hospital where they were rushed to, said police. The mother sustained severe burns and she was taken to Thrissur Medical College Hospital where she succumbed to the injuries. An officer with the Angamaly police said that the woman was quite depressed over her husband Anoop’s death. “She was reportedly at her paternal home on the day her husband’s death happened. She was quite depressed that she was not at the house when it happened. This could have led her to take the extreme step,” said the officer. Her husband was an autorickshaw driver. “Her mother-in-law Chellama had gone to the neighbour’s house when the incident happened on Wednesday. She was looking for her grandchildren but when she returned, she found the room locked and smelled Kerosene. Soon she raised an alarm,” said an officer with Angamaly police. The neighbours soon broke open the window and found the room full of smoke. They then broke open the door to find the mother and children with severe burn injuries. “All of them were rushed to a private hospital at Angamaly in an ambulance of the fire and rescue department. The children were pronounced dead here. Anju was then taken to Thrissur Medical College where she died,” said an officer. Suicides are preventable and help is just a phone call away. Those in distress can call Maitri at 0484-2540530 or Emergency Medical Services at 0471-2552056.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/woman-and-her-two-minor-children-die-of-burn-injuries/articleshow/85847491.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Court frees Good Samaritan accused by biker’s family||MUMBAI: A 53-year-old Dadar businessman, accused of knocking down a biker with his car in 2013, was acquitted after the court accepted as “probable” his defence that he was being falsely implicated after the biker’s parents refused to repay Rs 40,000 he had spent on his treatment after finding him unconscious on the road. Acquitting Sameer Pethe, the magistrate’s court said the biker had injuries, but “there is no evidence to prove the accused drove his four-wheeler in a rash and negligent manner… and caused grievous hurt to the injured”. The magistrate also noted that Abhijeet Mewada, the biker who became unconscious soon after falling down, could not have identified the car driver at the time of the incident. TimesViewRoad accident cases generally end up in long-drawn legal battles. The courts, on most occasions, rely heavily on the victims’ testimonials before giving verdict. In this case, however, the court paid minute attention to the material and circumstantial evidence before rejecting the victim’s claims. Hopefully, a case like this should not prevent Good Samaritans from helping accident victims.Another witness, too, did not identify Pethe, saying he arrived at the scene only after the accident. Pethe told the court that Mewada had lost control of his bike and fallen on the concrete road. He helped him, and later when he asked his parents to repay the money he had spent on his treatment, they refused and concocted the story. Mewada had suffered shoulder and arm injuries. He told the court that on October 25, 2013, between 8 and 10pm, he was going home to Worli from Shivaji Park. He accused Pethe of taking an illegal U-turn and ramming into him. He said he lost his senses soon after falling down. The investigating officer had specified in his cross-examination that Mewada had not given detailed description of Pethe during the recording of his statement. The court pointed out that the cop had deposed that Mewada had not seen Pethe at the time of the incident. “In my view, if the injured had seen the accused at the time of the incident, he would have narrated it while recording his statement…,” said the court. It added that Mewada had not clarified when he saw the accused in the car. “The evidence of the informant does not inspire confidence. In the circumstances, the defence raised by the accused appears to be probable,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-court-frees-good-samaritan-accused-by-bikers-family/articleshow/85849891.cms||Rebecca Samervel

Dange, in a two-page letter, said he and his family members fear for their lives. “I have a service weapon but that weapon cannot be carried when I am off duty or when I am going to see my aged father in Pune,” Dange told TOI. Dange said that he had taken action against several criminals including members of an Indian Mujahideen module, and there had been an attempt on his life while he was posted at Antop Hill police station. Dange has already filed a complaint last month that he and witnesses in the ACB case are being pressured not to pursue his complaint against Singh. “If something happens to me...

---||Bhopal||Keep tab of kids mobile usage: Cyber cops advisory to parents||Bhopal: Taken aback by the number of complaints that it has received in the last few days, Madhya Pradesh cyber cell headquarters have issued an advisory saying that web criminals are targeting children addicted to online games for frauds and stealing money from their parents. In one of the recent cases reported in July, a 13-year-old boy had committed suicide in Chattarpur district having lost Rs 40,000 in an online game. He had left behind a suicide note, saying that he was taking the extreme step after losing the said money. He was a student of class 6. Investigators found that he was scolded by his parents after they saw messages of money debited from their bank accounts. He hanged himself from the ceiling fan using a scarf, police said. Many complaints have come to fore in the last four months wherein children have fallen trap to online bullying and ended up paying up the fraudsters or sharing details of parents’ bank account, said an officer at the cyber HQ. He said parents should keep an eye on their children and their gaming activities with utmost care. “Due to the ongoing trend of playing online games, children insist on getting their own mobile or play online games using their parent’s phone. In these games, to enter the next level or to buy an avatar, weapon or dress, an online payment has to be made, which kids often make through their parent’s online banking or debit/credit card without informing them. Later on, the parents complain to the police about the online financial fraud,” says the advisory. MODUS OPERANDI Several games, most notably multiplayer mobile games, are equipped with facilities that allow players to make in-app and in-game purchases, for which, online payment through credit card/debit card/internet banking, is done by children without informing their parents. Many times, the card/bank details get saved in the online game’s payment mode, after which only OTP is required to make an online payment. Since OTP is sent on the parent’s mobile number, which is used by kids to play games online, they are able to make instant payments and delete all the messages related to such transactions. PRECAUTIONS 1.Prefer giving mobile without sim, connected to wi-fi, to children for online classes. Use wi-fi only tablets 2. Keep parental control over children’s online activity. Avoid sharing a mobile with the children which is linked to any bank account 3. Never allow or teach your children to make bill payments, recharge or other payments 4. If you receive any message about an online transaction, confirm it with your family about the transaction before reaching the Police. In case you are a victim of cyber frauds, register a complaint in your nearest police station or log in to www.cybercrime.gov.inorcall on Toll Free number 155260.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/keep-tab-of-kids-mobile-usage-cyber-cops-advisory-to-parents/articleshow/85847457.cms||---

Pradip Raundhal, forest officer, Khed forest range, who inspected the spot, told TOI, “Considering the deep claw injuries and pugmarks at the site, we strongly suspect that the woman was killed by a leopard. We have also recovered the animal’s hair from the spot. A team of veterinary doctors have collected DNA samples of the body to ascertain the animal attack. The post-mortem of the body was conducted at the rural hospital, Chandoli in Khed tehsil.” Wild animals such as leopard, wolf and hyena are sighted in forest areas near the village, said officials. “The woman’s body was found mauled in the attack. According to preliminary findings, the animal’s teeth pierced her chest, shoulder and neck,” said Jayram Gowda, deputy conservator of forest, Junnar division. The villagers spotted the body on Wednesday afternoon near a rivulet. “The woman stayed alone in a hut surrounded by sugar cane fields. We suspect that the animal might have attacked her early in the morning,” Raundhal said, adding that leopards were known to frequent the village. “There are at least four to five leopards in the village. One person sustained minor injuries in a leopard attack last week. The sightings of the animals have been quite frequent in the last two decades,” he added. In 2001, Jaganath Patole, a resident of the village, was killed in a leopard attack, said forest officials. The village has sugar cane fields and forest areas, so the animals have not left or migrated to any other place, said the officials. According to the state government rules, the victim’s family gets Rs15 lakh compensation from the forest department. Rs5 lakh is released to the family of the victim in 48 hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/woman-killed-in-suspected-leopard-attack-in-khed-tehsil/articleshow/85847469.cms||Sandip Dighe

Tiwari said the govt did not work on the fundamentals to ensure a quality life for Delhiites, while Bidhuri said that despite the BJP reminding the government time and again about cleaning of PWD drains, the Delhi government did not get the drains cleaned. “The rains left the AAP government totally exposed. Almost all roads and several colonies were flooded because the government ignored the basic needs of the capital like drainage,” Tiwari said. In a statement, Bidhuri said that the AAP government was selling the dream of making Delhi like London and Singapore but had actually made its condition worse. “The Minto Bridge underpass was flooded during rains on Wednesday and it was closed for vehicular traffic, and other roads were several feet under water,” Bidhuri said, claiming that the situation in Delhi was never so bad. Delhi government, however, said in a statement: “It’s raining heavily for two days. It is due to the steps taken by Delhi government that major problems like bus stuck in waterlogged Minto Bridge underpass did not happen. In addition, many places did not report waterlogging. We will make efforts to ensure that despite heavy rain, there is no waterlogging on the roads in future.

The truth is that there is a major shortage of coal. Coal is exhausted at many production units and about to be exhausted in other places,” the senior Congress leader claimed. “The government did not make any alternative arrangements in time, nor did it pay the previous dues, which has affected the production. And now, it is giving the excuse of scanty rainfall, empty dams and water logging in coal mines,” Nath alleged.

Candidates from Janata Dal(S), Aam Admi Party, Uttama Prajakeeya and other small outfits have the potential to upset the national parties’ calculations by eating into the votes of these parties. This has resulted in tough contest in some wards. For former corporators who are now seeking re-election, it has become a matter of prestige to retain the seat. The delimitation of wards and reservation has forced some of them to change their constituency while some have lost the pockets which were their vote bank.In ward no.3 BJP leader Iresh Anchatageri faces his own party’s Manjunath Naddatti who has turned a rebel. Another former corporator Shankar Shelke (BJP) has to face two formidable candidates — Basavaraj Jadhav of Congress and Prakash Ghatge (Congress rebel) — in ward 8. Ghatge, who had been declared official candidate of Congress, turned a rebel after he was denied B form at eleventh hour. All the three belong to Maratha community.In ward no.14 it is a direct fight between Shambhu Salimani (Congress) and former Congress corporator Subhas Shindhe (now BJP). Shindhe, who was aspiring for Congress ticket, shifted to BJP overnight after being denied ticket by Congress and managed to be the BJP candidate. While there are 6,000 Muslim voters in the ward, Hindu voters account for 4,000. Shindhe claims to cut into Muslim votes.The contest between two Brahmin candidates — Vishnu Korlahalli (BJP) and Aniruddh Chinchore (Congress) — who are greenhorns in ward no. 15 that covers Brahmin-dominated Malamaddi area has caused curiosity. Builder Shridhar Panajikar of JD(S) is also in the fray.

---||Kochi||Kerala: Create awareness of Pocso Act changes, say activists||KOCHI: There’s growing concern among lawyers and activists working for the protection of children from sexual abuse that not many have understood the newly-notified amendments under the Protection of children from sexual offences (Pocso) Act. This is mainly because of the increase in minorto-minor abuses in state, especially during Covid lockdown and online schooling. There is a growing suspicion that children have fallen into the trap triggered by the device’s access to social media which has led to them befriending strangers and also known persons. “It is really frightening for these children who share nude images of each other and then don’t know how to get out of it Girls meet the accused who ironically in many cases, is also a minor. We know of instances where the child is scared to tell parents and ends up commit ting suicide or falling victim to sexual abuse,” said an activist. She said that not many peo ple know that a minor can be booked under Pocso. “When parents come to know, they are hushing it up. In case of high school boys who are into using drugs, we have even heard of cases of incest. But, people are keeping quiet about it. It is when they come for counselling that we get to know such things,” she added. This is a concern raised by legal experts. “There is an urgent need to publicize the new amendments as the provisions of punishment for child abuse has been made more stringent. Many people think that if the boys are under 18, there is no chance of being prosecuted. Only the most gruesome are being charged. We should urgently introduce these rules to the public so that parents are warned,” said Bindu PA, special public prosecutor, Pocso court, Ernakulam. “We have been hearing of cases about rise in sexual abuse of minors. Parents often go to work leaving children under the care of their elder siblings. The elder kids are lost in their own world and the younger ones fall victim to their friends or neighbours. There are several cases of children getting into various social media platforms and getting trapped by predators on lookout for such children,” said Jenson VJ, social worker, Integrated Development Society, Alappuzha. Under the new rules, amended in March 2020, the states have been asked to prepare age appropriate educational material and curriculum for children, informing them about various aspects of personal safety, including measures to protect physical and virtual identity; to safeguard emotional and mental wellbeing, prevention and protection from sexual offences and reporting mechanisms, including Childline through toll free number 1098.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/create-awareness-of-pocso-act-changes-say-activists/articleshow/85847567.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

With the support of the people, we will rebuild the nation once again,” Solanki said, while addressing a press conference at the PCC office here. Solanki alleged that Rs60 lakh crore worth of national assets constructed over the decades is being handed-over for just Rs6 lakh crore to some selected industrial houses. “Prime Ministers -- from Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi, Narasimha Rao and even BJP’s Atal Bihari Vajpayee built this nation. There are 170 such public sector companies added to the country’s assets by these Prime Ministers. It is only Narendra Modi who has chosen to sell and not build,” Solanki alleged. Solanki said that when the British left, they left not more than Rs200 crore in the treasury and the country took loans from IMF and other financial institutions and along with tax-payers money, gave shape to modern India. “People of this nation are the owners of these assets, but it will no longer stay that way. Prime Minister Modi told everyone that he sold tea, isn’t it time that he revealed how he is selling the country’s assets?” Solanki asked. “Companies that are making profits are being sold. This logic has really baffled us because welfare states think of selling loss-making concerns, not those making profits. The time is not far when this regime, which is now selling the nation’s assets, will lease out its people,” the former Union minister claimed. Solanki said, “Congress has never compromised on the human factor. The way the party built the nation, it ensured generation of employment and meeting the basic necessities of the people. We will not pull down the working class and poor.” Solanki said that in 2008, the entire world, including Europe and the US were undergoing severe economic recession. “Then it was our economist Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who with the help of industrialists and people, steered the country out of depression”, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/govt-selling-natl-assets-says-former-union-min/articleshow/85847591.cms||Suchandana Gupta

Barai, who did his bachelors and masters in structural engineering from MSU, was the chief guest at ‘We are proud of you’ – a programme that was organized by the varsity to felicitate gold medallists at Sir Sayajirao Nagargruh at Akota. It was for the first time that the programme was held as a post annual convocation ceremony instead of pre-convocation ceremony which is held on the eve of the convocation ceremony at ‘Dhanvantri’ – the official residence of MSU vice-chancellor. While lauding the efforts of Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III, the erstwhile ruler of Baroda state, Barai said that it was due to his vision that strong foundation for educational institute like MSU was laid in Vadodara. “Name any domain – arts, science, technology or engineering – university’s alumni have made significant contributions in their field. There are Padma awardees, Nobel laureate that this university has produced. You are going to benefit from brand MSU,” he said. He also made gold medallists take a pledge that they will support education of at least one student as ‘gupt daan’. The university had organised its annual convocation ceremony on a virtual platform in April due to the Covid-19 induced pandemic and restrictions. A total of 184 students were awarded 285 gold medals during the 69th annual convocation. Of the total gold medals, 181 were conferred to girl students, while 104 were conferred to male students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/play-active-role-to-rejuvenate-and-uplift-msu-prof-barai/articleshow/85842599.cms||---

While most government and budget schools reopened for physical classes, private and corporate schools continued with online classes. Barring residential, social welfare and tribal welfare schools with hostel facilities, all schools reopened. However, the attendance was thin on the first day as most parents remained apprehensive about sending children back to the classroom. Schools in the city saw students coming in from 8am. As it was the first day, teachers and staff members were seen stationed both outside and inside the school premises to guide students as well as parents about the safety norms. “We had to constantly remind students to maintain social distance as coming back to school after so long was slightly overwhelming for them. We guided them at the entrance and directed them to their classes where they were made to sit in a zig-zag manner,” said K Bhagyalakshmi, a teacher at a government school in Malkajgiri. High attendance in government schools was attributed to mid-day meals, cramped homes of children and limited or no contact with friends, among others. Many students were happy to be back on campus after a long break. “The online classes were going well but I missed coming to school and meeting my friends. I am very happy to be back to school,” said Aarabhi Iyer, class 10 student of a government school in Somajiguda. While few students in government schools turned up in uniforms, others were seen in civil attire. “My uniform does not fit me any more as I have outgrown it,” said Chavali Vinod, a class 8 student of a government school in Secunderabad. At budget schools, the turnout was thin as only senior students turned up for physical classes. “Of a strength of 320 students, only 28 turned up on the first day. When we tried contacting the parents, many of them informed us that their child was either shifted to a government school or they had moved back to their villages,” said S Sujatha, headmistress of a budget school in Musheerabad. Several school managements are hopeful that the attendance of students for physical classes will go up over the next few weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/20-attendance-on-back-to-school-day-1/articleshow/85847157.cms||Preeti Biswas

---||Hyderabad||Third wave unlikely in Telangana, send kids to school: Government||HYDERABAD: A day after the high court put a question mark over the state’s preparedness and ordered it not to compel children to attend physical classes, the health department on Wednesday claimed that there was no chance of a third wave in Telangana unless a new variant emerged and urged parents to send children to school without fear. However, it will be the collective responsibility of parents, school authorities and society at large to prevent the spread of the virus in schools, officials said. Health officials said that only vaccinated staff would be allowed in schools and a class or school (depending on overall strength) would be shut in case of an outbreak. “If more than 5 cases are recorded in an educational institution, it will be closed for a few days. If cases are recorded in the same class, the class will be closed for a week. We urge parents not to fear another wave and send children to schools. Schools have been told to take precautions and teach children mask etiquette and maintain social distancing. Currently, the situation is under control. We might not see a third wave unless a new highly infectious variant emerges,” claimed state public health director Dr G Srinivasa Rao. Citing its own analysis of Covid cases, the state health department claimed that out of the total cases only 13% were of those aged below 20. Out of this, 10% were of children aged above 10, while 3% of children below 10 years. State health officials also cited the work on vaccines for children to allay parents’ concerns. While when such a vaccine would be available is still not clear, local health officials claimed the one for children above 15 years might be available from September and for those aged below 2 from October. “In total three vaccines might come for kids. The vaccines are currently under clinical trials and are likely to be available soon,” the official claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/3rd-wave-unlikely-send-kids-to-school-govt/articleshow/85847222.cms||Amrita Didyala

The decision was taken by many colleges as the counselling process for degree and professional courses for first year students is still in progress. “Since the first year admissions are currently in progress, we have decided to hold regular classes for all students only from September 6. While some second and final year students did visit the college, the turnout was barely 20 per cent,” said K Shashank, in-charge principal of Government Institute of Electronics, East Marredpally. Colleges that reopened on Wednesday started the first day with practical session.

Several state universities and colleges are making arrangements to reopen from next week.  “There is a high level of response and students are eager to join back both hostels and classes. Arrangements are being made to ensure smooth conduct of classes and hostels from next week. The attendance of students will increase in coming days, especially after the hostels reopen,” said R Limbadri, chairman, Telangana State Council of Higher Education (TSCHE).

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Pre-term infant beats severe post-Covid syndrome||A 36-week premature baby, diagnosed with severe immune overreaction linked to post-Covid syndrome, recovered successfully at a Pune city hospital after experiencing a slew of complications, including renal failure necessitating dialysis, in June. The baby’s mother had Covid-19 infection at 14 weeks of pregnancy which, the experts said, might have led to the transmission of the infection to the foetus through the placenta. The baby was born on May 22, following which both the baby and the mother were detected with high concentration of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The baby’s condition started worsening rapidly five days after birth. The newborn developed respiratory failure, shock due to a steep drop in blood pressure, kidney failure, which necessitated life-saving ventilator support. On the brighter side, the treatment with fast-acting antibodies and steroids with dialysis dramatically improved the baby’s condition. The baby registered full recovery and was discharged on June 16 after 16 days of intensive care at the hospital. “This is the first case of a preterm neonate in medical literature to survive multisystem inflammatory syndrome in neonates (MIS-N) despite acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring dialysis in India,” said chief neonatologist Sachin Shah of Surya Mother and Child Superspeciality Hospital in Wakad. As per reported worldwide literature, there are just 22 cases with variable presentations of MIS-N, mortality in which is above 10%. “The progression of AKI in children is considered a post-viral inflammatory response. It is not clearly understood at this time. The general consensus is that there is a cytokine storm [abnormal immune overreaction] leading to organ damage,” Shah said. Some of the blood tests of the baby, including D dimer, were elevated indicating a hyperimmune response. “Though in majority of newborns, antibodies are protective, in some cases, they may trigger an abnormal inflammatory response and cytokine storm leading to rapid deterioration of the clinical condition,” Shah said. “The child is doing fine and attaining all the developmental milestones,” said the mother of the child.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-pre-term-infant-beats-severe-post-covid-syndrome/articleshow/85850006.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The projects would now need consent from 51% buyers for securing extension of the respective completion dates. There are 103 such projects that exceeded the deadline in 2017, 541 in the following year and 1,180 in 2019. Many of the projects had failed to complete even after extension of one year as per Section 6 of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act. “All these projects would now require consent of 51% buyers under Section 7(3) of the Act,” an official said. According to the Act, the developers of these projects are prohibited from selling, advertising or marketing them before seeking the extension. Of the 1,824 projects listed as expired by MahaRERA, applications for extension of 350 projects have been submitted. “These applications are under scrutiny,” an official privy to the development said. MahaRERA had given an extension to the deadlines up to September for the projects that were supposed to be completed in March. “The rest of the projects had deadlines before the pandemic year of 2020,” a MahaRERA official said. Most of the projects are based in Pune, Mumbai, Thane and Raigad. Another 1,500 projects might be under the scanner as their deadline was over in March 2021. The developers of these projects can now avail of extension of a period of one year under Section 6 of RERA. Developers felt that the authorities should take a “considerate approach” as the market had been down and there were difficulties in procuring documents within the deadline. Anarock Property consultants chairman Anuj Puri said the MahaRERA’s move sent out a strong signal to the errant developers delaying the projects. “Homebuyers have been waiting to get possession of projects for the past three years. Last year was unique with the pandemic creating disruption in the supply chain and non-availability of constructions. It (2020) should be treated as an exception,” he said. Credai Maharashtra president Sunil Furde told TOI: “MahaRERA was right in pointing out the status of the unfinished projects. But many projects are shown ‘incomplete’ because of technical reasons. The authorities should evaluate this.” He said projects of Credai members listed on the portal had been completed on time. “The completion certificate of these projects has been received from the municipal corporations before the registered dates. There are some projects that were completed but the completion certificates were received later,” Furde said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/maharera-flags-1824-housing-projects-across-state-as-expired/articleshow/85847630.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The dissenting priests are demanding the continuation of Janabhimukha Kurbana (conduct of the Holy Mass facing the faithful) while the recent Synod has decided to adopt the new practice of conducting Holy Mass facing the altar. The archbishop in his letter to the priests has directed them to read the pastoral letter of the major archbishop of the Syro-Malabar Church on the new mode in all the parish churches and associated institutions on Sunday. He pointed out that the Synod held from August 16 to 27 had decided to implement the new mode of celebrating the Holy Mass as exhorted by Pope Francis, from November 28. Mar Thazhath said he has come to know that a section of the priests is planning to hold a meeting on the decision of the Synod and its implementation, without the permission of the head of the archdiocese. “Holding such a meeting to discuss a decision approved by the Pope and Synod could lead to sectarianism. That will also run against the spirit of the oath taken by the priests during ordination. I humbly request to avoid such meetings,” the letter said. However, the dissenting priests allege that the decision was taken without holding discussions with them. A senior priest that a Zoom meeting of the priests is planned. They are also planning to send a delegation to the Vatican to directly inform the Pope about their objections. They will first meet the Pope’s representative in Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/thrissur-archbishop-warns-priests/articleshow/85847657.cms||T Ramavarman
---||Pune||Supply constraints to delay inclusion of Sputnik V in govt vaccination sites||PUNE: The chairman of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation, Dr N K Arora, told TOI that the Russian vaccine Sputnik V might not be able to enter the government inoculation sites till its supply increased substantially. Explaining the reason behind the delay in its supply, Arora said, “Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine uses two different adenoviruses as the viral vectors. The first shot contains adenovirus 26 (Ad26) as the viral vector, while the second contains adenovirus 5 (Ad5). The manufacturing of the second dose is a slow process, because the Ad5 virus grows very slowly. Since the second dose takes time to manufacture, the supplies have been delayed. First doses would be available only when supplies of the second shot are ramped up.” So far, only a few lakh doses of the vaccine have been available for use in India. Several private hospitals have run out of the vaccine’s first dose, a source in one of the facilities in Pune said on Wednesday. Dr Arora said some viruses grow very slowly in controlled conditions, including adenovirus 5. “The virus has been used in the past for candidate vaccines and has posed the same issue. Sputnik V’s availability so far in India is not high enough to incorporate the vaccine in the government’s free vaccination programme. Only when the availability increases, a system, along with cold storage of the vaccine, can be worked out to introduce it in government centres. The vaccine requires appropriate cold chain storage — till up to half-an-hour before it is administered,” he said. The vaccine has to be stored at -18°C for stability and potency. Apart from Russia, only India was manufacturing the vaccine currently, he said. Dr Arora said the manufacturing process of the vaccine had begun in India, but the issues in ramping up the second dose production was being experienced here as well as in Russia. “Dr Reddy’s, which launched Sputnik V on a pilot basis in India, is trying to resolve the issue over the last two-three months now and we are given to understand that there would soon be a headway.” In an email response to TOI, a spokesperson from Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Limited said, “We are working closely with our partners in India for manufacturing readiness. We expect that locally manufactured doses are likely to be available from the September-October period. We have received 31.5 lakh doses of component 1 and 4.5 lakh doses of component 2 of the Sputnik V vaccine in India so far. We are working closely with the RDIF (Russian Direct Investment Fund) to ramp up supplies.” People who want the first dose of Sputnik V have been complaining of delay in getting the vaccine shot. A representative of a private hospital that was earlier administering the vaccine said the facility had stopped giving the first doses because it had run out of stock. “We still have the second doses of Sputnik, which had come with the first lot we had received. The second shots would have to be used for those who are due,” the representative said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/supply-constraints-to-delay-inclusion-of-sputnik-v-in-govt-vaccination-sites/articleshow/85847665.cms||Neha Madaan

---||Kolkata||Hosps face Cov-non-Cov bed balance challenge||Kolkata: With a rise in the number of Covid patients over the last week, private hospitals are facing the challenge of accommodating non-Covid patients — whose number is the highest since the onset of the pandemic — while considering extending their Covid units. More Covid admissions, that have already doubled at several private hospitals over the last 8-10 days, would force a squeeze of non-Covid sections that are now operating at full capacity. At AMRI Hospitals, non-Covid patients have crossed 550 across three units, which is the highest since March last year. The number of surgeries, too, is the highest in the last 18 months. The hospital has 50 Covid beds, of which 32 are occupied. It was just 17 last week. “If the present rate of Covid patient growth continues, we will be faced with the compulsion of cutting down on non-Covid patients. About 80% of our non-Covid beds are occupied and a lot of them have undergone procedures deferred due to the pandemic,” said AMRI CEO Rupak Barua. Peerless Hospital has 289 non-Covid patients. The hospital had 20 Covid patients till last Sunday, but the number has jumped to 31. “If this continues, we must extend our Covid unit, which will lead to a reduction in non-Covid admissions,” said CEO Sudipta Mitra. A Covid patient died at the hospital on Tuesday. Mitra added that with Bangladesh flights about to resume, enquiries have been pouring in from patients there. “We are now making two-three admissions from Bangladesh every day. We also have a huge number of local non-Covid patients who have surgeries and procedures lined up over the next two-three weeks,” he said.An extra Covid ward will have 50 beds at Peerless, which could see an equal number of non-Covid admissions being curtailed. Medica Superspecialty Hospital is yet to see a rise in Covid patients, but expects an explosion by the month-end. “There has been a spurt in positivity rate in tests we conducted. We have 250 non-Covid patients, which may have to come down by September-end to accommodate Covid patients,” said Medica chairperson Alok Roy. There are 425 non-Covid and 12 Covid patients at RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences at present. “Other than a minor rise in the positivity rate over the last few weeks, there hasn’t been any remarkable change,” said RTIICS zonal head R Venkatesh. He added if Covid numbers rise, non-Covid beds could be reduced “following the process adopted during the first two waves”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/hosps-face-cov-non-cov-bed-balance-challenge/articleshow/85847660.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Lucknow||Supertech row: UP CM Yogi Adityanath orders strict action against guilty||LUCKNOW/NOIDA: A day after the Supreme Court ordered demolition of the 40-storey twin towers being constructed in Noida's Sector 93A, UP CM Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday ordered strict action against Noida Authority officials who were involved in allowing anomalies in construction of the two structures. Presiding over a high level meeting in Lucknow, Yogi pointed out that the case dated back to 2004 and therefore a special inquiry committee should be constituted to probe the anomalies which were conducted over a period of time. “Each and every official responsible for the irregularities should be brought to book in the case,” the CM stressed, directing officials to comply with the order of the Supreme Court. Following the instructions of the CM, a joint probe team of senior officials has been entrusted with the investigation of the matter. Emerald Court flats just 10ft away from Supertech twin towersAt the same time, departmental proceedings have also been started against the erring employees for not making higher officials aware of all the facts about the issue. “The matter was pending in the court till now. Action will be initiated against the officials after a thorough probe by the special inquiry committee. We will follow every point of ruling by the apex court,” Noida CEO, Ritu Maheshwari, told TOI. Officials said that action would be initiated against the then officials and employees who were responsible for the anomalies. According to a statement issued by the Noida Authority, the issue pertains to T-16 and T-17 towers constructed by Supertech on a 54,815 sq mt plot (number GH-04) in Sector-93 A. The allotment of plot and sanctioning of the map was done between 2004 and 2012. The structural maps for the said plot were given further sanctions in 2005, 2006, 2009 and 2012. On December 10, 2012, the resident welfare association (RWA) of the society filed a writ petition before the Allahabad high court alleging that the National Building Code-2005 and NOIDA building rule-2010 were flouted and adequate space between the two towers was not kept. On April 11, 2014, the Allahabad high court ordered demolition of the two towers besides taking action against the builder and the officials. However, on May 5, 2014, the apex court passed a stay order on the high court after a Special Leave Petition (No. 11959/2014) was filed. A senior Noida official said that the Tuesday ruling of the SC was essentially the detailed orders on the SLP while endorsing the HC orders. “The record of this case is replete with instances which highlight the collusion between the officers of Noida with the appellant and its management," said a bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and M R Shah in its 140-page verdict. The top court also affirmed the HC order for sanctioning prosecution under provisions of Uttar Pradesh Urban Development Act and Industrial Area Development Act, against the officials of the Supertech Ltd and the officers of Noida for violations of the provisions of laws. The apex court said that the two towers be hammered down under the supervision of Central Building Research Institute (CBRI) within three months of the ruling. The cost of the entire exercise will be borne by Super Tech builders. The builders will also be required to refund the allottees – except those who have been given back their money before – along with an annual interest of 12%. After SC order, Noida official suspendedAn official recently shunted out of Noida Authority’s planning department was suspended by the state government late on Wednesday as heads started to roll a day after the Supreme Court ordered the demolition of Supertech’s twin towers at Emerald Court in Noida and prosecution of officials who colluded with the builder. Mukesh Goyal, a manager, was transferred from Noida Authority last month, soon after the SC’s scathing observations during a hearing in the case on August 5 when it called the authority a corrupt body. The Noida CEO had recommended action against Goyal on the basis of a preliminary inquiry, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/supertech-row-cm-orders-strict-action-against-guilty/articleshow/85850032.cms||Pankaj Shah

The region had added 34,000 cases in July and over 37,300 in June. “There has been a constant drop in monthly additions of Covid-19 cases for the last four months. In April, the region had added over 3 lakh patients,” a health official said. Data by the district health office has revealed that August recorded more recoveries as compared to addition of new patients. “With this, August has become the third month so far in 2021 recording more discharges of Covid-19 patients as against addition of new cases. Other two months were January and June,” the health official said, citing the data. The official said daily cases in urban pockets has been on the decline since the last couple of months. “The daily positive cases in the Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal limits have stayed below 500 on most days in August. The new cases in the rural area have been staying between 500 and 1,000 every day. The share of positive cases from the rural parts was around 55% of the total cases of 30,299 recorded in August,” the official said. Sanjeev Wavre, assistant medical chief, PMC, said despite a drop in daily cases, instructions had been issued to continue with stringent contract-tracing measures. “Daily cases in PMC limits have stayed below 500 since the last few weeks. No any outbreak has been reported in any of the civic ward limits recently. However, we have continued to operate swab collection centres. The citizens are appealed to go for swab testing in case of symptoms. There is a need to be cautious, especially in the backdrop of relaxations and festive season,” Wavre said. An official from the health department said the daily caseload in the rural parts had been above 500, prompting the administration to opt for concentrated efforts as a part of its Covid mitigation efforts. Testing breaches 70 lakh-markThe Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR) on Wednesday added 1,085 new cases of Covid-19 as against 730 recoveries, with the testing increasing above 32,500, including more than 16,300 tests from the rural areas. The region’s tally of sample testing increased above 70 lakh on Wednesday evening. The daily testing has been ramped up in the region since the last few days. A report released by district health officer Bhagwan Pawar stated that tally of positive cases increased to 11.16 lakh on Wednesday evening, while the recoveries jumped past10.88 lakh. The region’s active caseload reached 9,327 on Wednesday. Twelve more deaths were recorded in the region in the last 24 hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/at-30k-covid-cases-in-pmr-hit-six-month-low-in-august/articleshow/85847647.cms||Sarang Dastane

---||Ahmedabad||BJP in Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation: No free medical services for 3rd childbirth||AHMEDABAD: The leader of the ruling BJP in the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), has proposed to the standing committee and executive wing to implement a three-decade-old VS Hospital resolution, which restricts benefits of free childbirth medical services to two children per couple. The resolution has a rider. Free benefits can be availed for a third child only if either the mother or the father consents to undergo birth control surgery. If implemented, this archaic 1987 resolution may clash with the Union government’s Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakaram (JSSK) 2011, which entitles pregnant women to free childbirth medical services without restrictions on the number of children. Moreover, the number of JSSK beneficiaries in the city has also fallen drastically in the last three years — from 8,843 in 2018-19 to just 1,010 in 2020-21. Total births registered under this scheme fell by 48% in 2019-20 and by a further 77% in 2020-21. The JSSK policy states, ‘It is an initiative with a hope that states will come forward and ensure that benefits under JSSK reach every needy pregnant woman coming to a government institutional facility. All states and UTs have initiated implementation of the scheme.’ There is no condition in the scheme which restricts the number of times this benefit can be availed. Bhaskar Bhatt, leader of the BJP in the AMC, says, “The 1987 resolution was passed by the VS board. We have not invented it. The idea is to lessen the financial burden on the civic body. Our VS Hospital, Shardaben Hospital and LG Hospital cater to patients from outside the city and state too. We now have proposed to the executive wing to devise a similar policy for Shardaben and LG hospitals.” The resolution was passed by the independent board of VS Hospital on August 27, 1987. The resolution as proposed by Dr Surendra P Patel and was backed by the then Congress councillor and present BJP Rajya Sabha MP Narhari Amin, the chairman Jayendra Pandit and six other members.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bjp-proposes-two-child-limit-for-free-natal-services/articleshow/85847784.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Ready to go it alone in UP if required, says AIMIM||Hyderabad: All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen will contest in more than 100 seats if the Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha, a political front of smaller parties fails to sustain until the elections to 403-member Uttar Pradesh State Assembly in early 2022. Though the first option will be to contest elections under a strong-alliance, AIMIM is preparing the ground to go alone too if needed. Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi-led party is presently a part of Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha led by Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) president Om Prakash Rajbhar. It was the recent meeting of Rajbhar with the BJP UP state president that led to speculation that he was leaning towards BJP and that the Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha may not sustain for long. However, Rajbhar made it clear that his meeting with the BJP state president was not in connection with joining the BJP-led alliance and that SBSP was still leading the Morcha. AIMIM is trying to rope in Bheem Army chief Chandrasekhar Azad-led newly formed political entity ‘Azad Samaj Party’ into the alliance. AIMIM UP president Shaukath Ali told TOI that they will not stop at anything. “We have the capacity to contest from all the 403- Assembly segments but the top priority is to form a strong-alliance to stop the BJP from coming back to power and also protect the interests of Muslims, SCs, STs, BCs and other down-trodden sections. Yes, we said we would like to contest 100 seats but a final call would be taken by the alliance,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ready-to-go-it-alone-in-up-if-required-says-aimim/articleshow/85850036.cms||Roushan Ali

The jury headed by National Film Award winner R Sharath expressed its deep discontent over the deplorable portrayal of women and children in serials. “The channels should ensure a sense of responsibility in broadcasting television serials and comedy considering that it is meant for family viewing,” the jury noted. The jury further pointed out that majority of the entries scarcely fulfilled the objectives of the award. “For this reason, awards could not be declared for best serial, second best serial, best director and best art director. There were no entries in short film for children which again was unfortunate,” the jury opined. Thirty-nine entries were submitted in the fiction category. Six entries were for tele-serial category, 14 in telefilm, 11 in TV show entertainment and eight entries were received in comedy programmes. The jury for non-fiction also criticized the entries. The jury opined that not many makers seemed interested in creating documentaries which intervened in contemporary lives of Kerala society. Aswathy Srikanth and Sivaji Guruvayur won awards for best actress and best actor respectively. Saran Sasidharan was adjudged as the best cameraman and Vishnu Viswanathan won the award for best editor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/tv-award-jury-bemoans-portrayal-of-women-kids/articleshow/85847720.cms||---

They also promised to handle the illegal hawker menace if the authorities failed to do so. Condemning the attack on assistant municipal commissioner Kalpita Pimpale, MNS president Raj Thackeray urged the municipal corporation and the ruling party to hold an iron fist over such lawless hawkers. “The menace of illegal hawkers has to be reined in. We will also keep a check on the situation here on,” he said while talking to the media after meeting the injured officer. The party had previously written to the Thane police, claiming all women deployed on such risky field jobs would henceforth be provided security cover by local MNS activists. Senior BJP leader Chitra Wagh, who was in the city and spoke to the media, questioned the situation in the state where even municipal employees were being brutally attacked. “There is no safety for residents, and now even officials are being blatantly attacked.

---||Kolkata||Swab sample of man who flew in from Dubai tests +ve for Delta||Kolkata: The swab sample of a 57-year-old man tested positive to the Delta variant of Covid. The patient — a naval architect — had undergone treatment for Covid with his wife at a city private hospital in July after the duo tested positive on their return from Dubai. They have now recovered and have been discharged from hospital. The wife’s genome sequencing report is pending. Genome sequencing is done mostly on samples sent from government laboratories or hospitals. But in this case, the hospital took the initiative. According to sources, the man works in Saudi Arabia. The couple flew into the city via Dubai in mid-July to see the wife’s ailing mother. While both had tested negative before they flew from Dubai, they tested positive to rapid antigen tests upon arrival at the Kolkata airport. They then visited Peerless Hospital to check it again and an RT-PCR test confirmed Covid. “While the wife only had a mild infection, the husband had a moderate disease and we had to put him on medications except oxygen therapy. I had a strong hunch that the duo could be infected by the delta variant,” said internal medicine specialist Chadramouli Mukherjee. Doctors noticed a very low CT value in the couple’s RT-PCR reports. The hospital’s microbiology department was roped in for its opinion on genome sequencing of the couple’s samples. After the patients consented and the matter was pursued with the state health department, the duo’s samples were collected on July 30 and sent to National Institute of Biomedical Genomics in Kalyani. The result confirming delta on the man’s samples came on August 29. “The couple has acted responsibly. While discharging them, we reminded them to keep themselves isolated for another two weeks and maintain Covid-appropriate behaviour to make sure they didn’t infect others,” said Mukherjee. Doctors said the duo had taken both jabs of the Astrazeneca vaccine in Saudi Arabia days before their trip to India. “Despite the infection, none of them developed a severe illness since they had got both doses of a vaccine,” said microbiologist Bhaskar Narayan Chaudhuri. The second Covid wave in India is believed to have been triggered by the Delta variant. There have been cases of breakthrough infections, and in many of them, the infection had been found to have been caused by the Delta variant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/swab-sample-of-man-who-flew-in-from-dubai-tests-ve-for-delta/articleshow/85847706.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Pune||In Pune, 36-week premature infant beats severe post-Covid syndrome||PUNE: A 36-week premature baby, diagnosed with severe immune overreaction linked to post-Covid syndrome, recovered successfully at a city hospital after experiencing a slew of complications, including renal failure necessitating dialysis, in June. The baby’s mother had Covid-19 infection at 14 weeks of pregnancy which, the experts said, might have led to the transmission of the infection to the fetus through the placenta. The baby was born on May 22, following which both the baby and the mother were detected with high concentration of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The baby’s condition started worsening rapidly five days after the birth. The newborn went on to develop respiratory failure, shock due to a steep drop in blood pressure, kidney failure, which necessitated life-saving ventilator support. On the brighter side, treatment with fast-acting antibodies, called intravenous immunoglobulins, and steroids with early initiation of peritoneal dialysis dramatically improved the baby’s condition. The baby registered full recovery on all parameters and was discharged after 16 days of intensive care at the hospital on June 16. “This is the first case of a preterm neonate in medical literature to survive multisystem inflammatory syndrome in neonates (MIS-N) despite acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring dialysis in India,” said chief neonatologist Sachin Shah of Surya Mother and Child Superspeciality Hospital in Wakad. The severe AKI was the main presenting complaint and needed peritoneal dialysis as opposed to cardiovascular involvement in previously reported cases of MIS-N. Peritoneal dialysis is a way to remove waste products from your blood when your kidneys can't adequately do the job any longer. As per reported worldwide literature, there are just 22 cases with variable presentations of MIS-N, mortality in which is above 10%. “The progression of AKI in children is considered a post-viral inflammatory response. It is not clearly understood at this time. The general consensus is that there is a cytokine storm (abnormal immune overreaction) leading to organ damage,” Shah said. Some of the blood tests of the baby, including D dimer, were elevated indicating a hyperimmune response. “Though in the majority of newborns, the antibodies are protective, in some cases, they may trigger an abnormal inflammatory response and cytokine storm leading to rapid deterioration of the clinical condition,” he said. The take-home is message is clear. “Atypical presentation of MIS-N in form of AKI should not be missed since it is treatable with definitive and supportive care,” Shah said. “The child is doing fine and attaining all the developmental milestones,” said the mother of the child. Other members of the hospital team who took care of the baby at various stages of complications included neonatal intensivists Amita Kaul, Ganesh Shiwarkar, Saleha Dhalait and nephrologist Girish Kumthekar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/preterm-infant-beats-severe-post-ncov-syndrome-doing-fine-now-says-mom/articleshow/85847685.cms||Umesh Isalkar

---||Lucknow||42 lakh poor got houses in 4 years, previous govts built 50 lakh in 30 years, says UP CM Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: Unleashing a frontal attack on the opposition, chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday said previous governments in Uttar Pradesh never had the poor, women, farmers or youth on their agenda and this is buttressed by hard statistics. Only 53lakh houses could be provided to the needy in last 30 years, Yogi said, while distributing keys to 5.41 lakh beneficiaries of PM Awas Yojana (PMAY) and CM Awas Yojana (CMAY). In contrast, the BJP government, he said, provided 41.73 lakh houses in rural and urban areas in four years, which is a record. “It was only after PM Narendra Modi assumed power in 2014 that the poor were associated with various schemes of the government without discrimination of caste, region or religion,” said Yogi, who also interacted with beneficiaries from Ayodhya, Varanasi, Rae Bareli, Bahraich and Kushinagar. He said, people were unable to receive the entire amount under PMAY scheme. “Earlier, there was corruption and discrimination,” Yogi said, insisting that Jan Dhan accounts opened in banks following PM Modi’s directions plugged leakages and the needy received the entire amount. The CM enquired from beneficiaries if they had received benefits of other schemes, including Ujjwala, Saubhagya and Ayushman. The CM maintained that houses provided to poor under PMAY and CMAY were part of the pro-people agenda of the BJP government at the Centre and state. Yogi lauded the Lakhimpur Kheri administration for promoting the “cluster approach”, under which the needy were provided houses and facilities like electricity and piped drinking water in a township-like setting in Landanpur village. “Earlier, development was usurped by nepotism and casteism. However, when a good government is chosen by the people, benefits from schemes reach every needy,” Yogi stressed. He added, the state government was satisfied that 70% owners of PMAY were women, which has, in turn brought them closer to the dream of PM Modi to make women ‘atmanirbhar’ (self-reliant). Yogi also pitched for the coming together of economically sound rural families and the state government for providing better facilities in villages. “People should not be totally dependent on the government. They should instead help in bringing socio-economically poor people into the mainstream,” he insisted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cm-42l-poor-got-houses-in-4-yrs-previous-govts-built-50l-in-30-yrs/articleshow/85850073.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Pune||Pune: Civic bodies plan to focus on inoculation in slum pockets||PUNE: The civic bodies would conduct dedicated vaccination drives in slum pockets in September to boost Covid-19 vaccination. The health department officials of Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal corporations stated that they would dedicate additional teams to cover the eligible residents from the slums as the vaccine supply had improved. A Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) official said the drive was affected a few weeks ago because of the inconsistent vaccine supply. The district received over 12 lakh Covishield and Covaxin doses in August. The Pune circle health officials stated that the district was likely to get around 20 lakh Covishield and Covaxin doses in September. After the record vaccination of over 2.34 lakh beneficiaries on Tuesday, a total of 39,240 beneficiaries got the jabs on Wednesday. Ashish Bharati, the PMC’s health department chief, told TOI, “The consistent vaccine supply has given us a chance to cover the susceptible population at the earliest. We shall form dedicated teams to cover the slum areas in the city and ensure that the regular vaccination does not get affected because of the special drives. We are also focusing on speedy vaccination across the wards, where the number of Covid-19 cases are rising. A strategy is being devised.” A PMC official said the ward-wise vaccination data did not hold much importance because any beneficiary could get vaccine from any vaccination site in the city. Pimpri Chinchwad municipal commissioner Rajesh Patil told TOI that they were covering the slum population via the vaccine-on-wheels programme and some dedicated sites, but few more additional teams would be deployed to speed up the vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/civic-bodies-plan-to-focus-on-inoculation-in-slum-pockets/articleshow/85847718.cms||Piyush Bhusari

Until now, only men were employed in these wildlife tourism activities. This comes just months after the government had announced in March that women Gypsy drivers — referred to as pilots — and nature guides would be appointed at Corbett Tiger Reserve after training them. Nearly 50 women are being trained to take up responsibilities in the two tiger reserves — Rajaji Tiger Reserve and Corbett — and six sanctuaries in the state which boast of high populations of tigers, leopards and elephants. The first batch of 21 women is currently undergoing training in Dehradun. J S Suhag, chief wildlife warden, claimed that this would be the first time that women would take up the mantle of Gypsy pilots and nature guides "in all tiger reserves and sanctuaries in a state". Notably, two tiger reserves in Madhya Pradesh — Kanha Tiger Reserve-National Park and the Pench Tiger Reserve-National Park — have women guides who accompany tourists to core areas to catch a glimpse of the big cat. But this is not across sanctuaries and does not include pilots. Uttarakhand forest minister Harak Singh Rawat said that Corbett — which has 105 nature guides, all of them male — and Rajaji reserves will be the first to get women pilots. “Women have played a crucial role in conserving forests in Uttarakhand. With these jobs, they can earn a livelihood as well as help the forest department keep an eye on protected areas,” the minister said. When TOI spoke to women trainees at the forefront of this change in the hill state, some said they would focus on promoting responsible tourism while others were excited about playing a vital part in protecting the ecology of the hills. Meenakshi Kumari, a resident of Pauri Garhwal who will soon be deployed as a Gypsy pilot in Corbett, said she would derive “immense satisfaction” from the job. “My family has long carried out conservation efforts at a local level, for me, this job would be a natural extension of that legacy,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-to-deploy-women-as-wildlife-safari-drivers-nature-guides-across-sanctuaries/articleshow/85842690.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: NIV had warned of viral co-infections||AHMEDABAD: The 339% increase in cases of chikungunya in the first eight months of 2021, compared to the same period the previous year, has led the civic body to press the alarm button. What is worrying them even more is the incidence of co-infections of dengue and chikungunya cases in patients. It is worth noting that in a 2019 sero-survey, the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, had found cases with co-infection of dengue and chikungunya in patients from Gujarat samples. Sources in the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) say that the Gujarat samples also contained those from Ahmedabad. In all, the NIV had collected 4,963 samples from the major districts of the country for the study. Of the 27 cases of co-infection of chikungunya and dengue, three patients were from Gujarat. The NIV study for that survey was published in the August edition of Elsevier’s International Journal of Infectious Diseases. While analyzing symptoms of the four different dengue virus serotypes — DenV1, DEnV2, DenV3 and Denv4 — and chikungunya and those with co-infections, the NIV study claimed that rashes were more common in DenV1 infected patients. In case of DenV2, nausea and vomiting, petechiae, when the tiny blood vessels called capillaries break open, rashes, rigours, malaise, low blood platelet count, were among the common findings. “A multi-variant analysis also revealed that eye pain was positively associated with chikungunya infection. Joint pain also showed a borderline association with chikungunya,” the study added. The study also found that DenV3 infected patients suffered headaches, chills, sore throat and abdominal pain. In patients with DenV4, body pain was the common symptom compared to other dengue serotype infections. The NIV study also mentioned that chills, abdominal pain, petechiae, rigors, malaise and thrombocytopenia were highly prevalent in patients with multiple dengue serotype infections. Headache, eye pain, body pain, joint pain, chills, nasal congestion, sore throat, and abdominal pain were more prevalent while rash, malaise and thrombocytopenia were less prevalent in chikungunya infected patients. The study concluded that of the total 4,963 samples from across the country 1,898 samples were positive for at least one serotype of the dengue virus, 150 were positive for chikungunya and 27 samples had dengue and chikungunya co-infection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/niv-had-warned-of-viral-co-infections/articleshow/85847764.cms||---

Erdogmus, the world's highest rated player in the category, picked up the gold while Ethan, who turns 10 on Friday, had to settle for the silver. His performance means he will now be awarded a Diploma by Fide, the world governing body for chess, and earn a direct entry into the World Cup 2021 Super Finals scheduled to be held in December. The World Cup Super Finals is a round-robin tournament contested amongst six of the world's best players in their respective categories. Ethan's performance calculations in the World Cup show a rating increase of 457 Elo points over the month-long event. According to Ethan's coach Prakash Singh, the youngster caused upsets of as many as 13 higher rated opponents, including three Candidate Masters (CMs). His best was against a 2168 Elo rated CM in the under-12 World Cup selection stage. "We were aiming for gold right from day one of the final stage. I was looking forward to Ethan becoming the world champion," said Singh. Ethan’s parents, Edwin Vaz and Linda Fernandes, were understandably ecstatic. "Representing India at the World Cup and coming within arm's reach of becoming the world champion has been a thrilling and enriching experience for Ethan as well as for all of us," the parents, who hail from Raia, said in a statement on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/chess-world-cup-ethan-settles-for-silver-earns-direct-spot-at-super-finals/articleshow/85880242.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Delta variant found in 91% sequenced samples in May||Visakhapatnam: The Delta variant (B.1.617.2) of the novel coronavirus seems to have dominated the second wave of the ongoing pandemic in the state. Nearly 91% of the total samples sequenced in May belonged to this lineage, which is said to be more transmissible than the earlier forms of the virus. State reported about 5.9 lakh infections in May alone, nearly 30% of the total cases surfaced in the state till date. The unprecedented surge in the daily case numbers in May, compared to 2,074 infections in February, 12,073 in March and 1.9 lakh in April, could be partly attributed to this dominant variant. The sudden change in the landscape of variants of concern (VOC) can be understood from the fact that the Delta variant was found in only 2% of the total sequenced samples in March in Andhra Pradesh. The share increased to 40% in April and 91% in May. Even though the first case of Delta variant was reported back in October 2020 in India, it was detected only in March in AP in genome sequencing. The Union ministry of health and family welfare established the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Consortium on Genomics (INSACOG), a grouping of 10 national laboratories, in December 2020. INSACOG has since been carrying out genomic sequencing and analysis of circulating Covid-19 viruses, and correlating epidemiological trends with genomic variants. For AP, Telangana and Goa, CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology and DBT-Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics, Hyderabad have been mapped as Hub Labs. The estimated sequencing capacity of these two institutions is 6,200 samples a month. As per the official data, Andhra Pradesh has so far reported two cases of Delta Plus variant (B.1.617.2.1 or AY.1). As per the updated guidelines of the INSACOG on genomic surveillance for SARS-CoV-2, each state is to designate a nodal officer, who will be the focal point for coordination of whole genome sequencing. The nodal officer is also responsible for identification of an adequate number of sentinel sites. At least 15 samples per fortnight from each of these sentinel sites should flow towards designated INSACOG Genome Sequencing Laboratories.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/delta-variant-found-in-91-sequenced-samples-in-may/articleshow/85847755.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

The accused was identified as Asish Shamsudeen, of Asish Manzil, Thekkumbhagam, Paravoor. Shamla and Salu, Kollam natives, of were returning after treatment at Government MCH, Thiruvananthapuram. While they stopped their car to have food near Thekkumbhagam beach, Shamsudeen accosted them. Though they told him that they were mother and son, he started showering abuses on them. When they tried to move away, he smashed the car’s windshield and beat them up with an iron rod. Subsequently, Shamsudeen went absconding and tried to escape to Tamil Nadu. Based on a tip-off received by the city police commissioner T Narayanan, police arrested him from Edppalayam near Thenmala. When Shamla complained to Paravoor police, the accused sent his sister to file a complaint that Shamla’s car hit her goat. But the police found that no such incident had take place and identified the sister’s case to be bogus. Shamla said that there was an attempt by police to settle the case by pointing out that the accused had also filed a complaint against them. Shamala pointed out that police could have arrested Shamsudeen on Tuesday night itself, but they didn’t. “Police asked me whether I was interested in pursuing the case citing that Shamsudeen had availed medical treatment at Mayyanadu hospital. How could he avail medical help if our car hit his goat. There was no such incident,” Shamala said. “They wanted to play down the case and now they claim that they had arrested the accused adventurously,” she said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/man-arrested-for-attacking-woman-son/articleshow/85847758.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: School reaches students’ homes in Covid times, teachers offer in-person classes||KOLKATA: At a time when online classes seem to be the only teaching-learning option, be it for school, college or university, St Augustine’s Day School, Shyamnagar, has taken classrooms to students’ homes. Teachers of pre-primary, primary and middle school have been visiting the children’s homes to teach them in small groups. An elaborate routine has been drawn up, dividing a class into groups of five to seven children living in the same locality. Every group is asked to get together at the home of one of the kids and the routine is such that every house has to host “the physical classes” at least twice a month. For the pre-primary to middle section at St Augustine’s, online classes have not been done away with but they are being interspersed with physical classes for as many days as possible. School CEO Amitava Chowdhury has christened the initiative, Boost—Bridging Online-Offline Study Time. “Lack of real interaction among themselves and teachers was causing the kids a lot of harm. We noticed in our youngest kids a gap in the development of social skills and hence, this decision of taking the school home. We are trying to address 1,350 kids this way. Though we are unable to replace the online classes completely, we are minimising its negative influence,” said Rodney Borneo, principal of the school. The school has been able to go for this unique arrangement with the consent of both parents and teachers. Now that some of the “home classes” have been held, both sides seem to be happy. The children are ecstatic, not only because it is a refreshing break from the monotony of staring at laptops or mobiles for hours with the teacher being just a “vision” on the other side, rattling out lessons, but also because they can be with other children. For many of the kids in the pre-primary and primary sections, this is their first experience of “a real school”. Many had taken admission only to find themselves in online classrooms. The kids, till now, had no idea what it felt like to attend classes with other children, to sit across a teacher, listen and follow her instructions and work under her supervision, and not that of their parents. The teacher does not visit alone. She is accompanied by a staff member, who first sanitizes the “classroom” and arranges for distanced seating, before lessons begin. The white board and pens and Montessori tools are taken to the home that hosts a teacher on a given day. The classes were being held in the presence of parents as making the kids sit at a distance and making them keep their masks on could be a major hurdle for children that young, the school said. “All teachers and staff visiting students’ homes have received two doses of the vaccine. So are the parents who are hosting and supervising the classes,” said Antara Chatterjee, headmistress of the pre-primary and primary sections. “The classes are a hit and others are calling up to confirm their turns,” said Sritama Mukherjee, co-ordinator of the pre-primary section.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/school-reaches-students-homes-in-cov-times-teachers-offer-in-person-classes/articleshow/85847777.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Pune||Bed reservation: State IMA seeks capped fee revision||Pune: The state unit of the Indian Medical Association on Wednesday sought revision in capped healthcare service charges when the state was mulling over extending the 80:20 Covid bed reservation till November. The Indian Medical Association (IMA) members stressed that they should be heard regarding the charges before a decision was taken on the bed reservation. They claimed that the input cost was much more than the rates mentioned by the government in the earlier order. The state health authorities said CM Uddhav Thackeray would clear the file on extending the bed reservation for Covid patients. The state’s previous order on it expired on August 31. State IMA president Dr Ramkrishna Londhe told TOI that they had been highlighting the capped fee issue since it was announced as it was not feasible. As per the IMA members, many small and medium hospitals are facing severe issues in operations due to the capped fee. Dr Sanjay Patil, the chairman of the Hospital Board of India, IMA, Pune, said small and medium hospitals owned by a single or a small group of doctors had immensely contributed during the second wave of the pandemic. He said, “If the government issues a directive on 80:20 bed reservation in hospitals and fee cap, it should also provide protective gears, medicines, oxygen and manpower.” He said if the government needed support from these hospitals under the impending threat of the third wave, the state government should revise the rates considering the view of all stakeholders and not through the extension of the previous order. Under the state’s previous order that expired on August 31, the cities were divided into A, B and C categories and the bed charges were capped for each group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bed-reservation-state-ima-seeks-capped-fee-revision/articleshow/85847750.cms||Nisha Nambiar

After considering a PIL, a division bench of Chief Justice S Manikumar and Justice Shaji P Chaly said the Crime Branch probe should not only include the “concerted action” behind the mass tree-felling but should also investigate the tree-felling in government and forest lands, in addition to its present scope of illegal treecutting from patta lands. It is a serious matter and no leniency or laxity can be shown, HC said. “Details of the trees and value involved, which are specifically shown above and discussed, would make it clear that a concerted action has taken place, in order to cut and remove the valuable trees from the forest areas, Government and patta lands, which could not have been done with the connivance and blessings of the high officials of the departments concerned,” the judgment stated. The court said it is not saying anything more at this stage as it would affect the probe. The ongoing probe should include investigation into all aspects involved in the issue and from all angles without fail and at the earliest, the court said while reminding that the state government has to “zealously safeguard” the larger public interest as it is the trustee of the public property. The court also specifically allowed any member of the public to approach the high court with authentic materials at a later stage if investigation is not going forward in the right direction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-declines-cbi-probe-in-muttil-tree-felling-case/articleshow/85847846.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Cow should be declared national animal & its protection Hindus fundamental right, says Allahabad high court||PRAYAGRAJ: Observing that the cow should be declared the national animal and its protection be made a fundamental right of the Hindus because when the country’s culture and its faith get hurt, the country becomes weak, the Allahabad high court on Wednesday denied bail to a man accused of cow slaughter. Denying bail to Javed of UP’s Sambhal district, Justice Shekhar Kumar Yadav in his 12-page judgement noted that the applicant had, after committing theft of the cow, killed it, beheaded it and also kept its meat. “This is not the first offence of the applicant. Earlier also, he had committed cow slaughter which had disturbed the harmony of the society,” the court said as it found that if the applicant was released on bail, he would again commit the same offence which will vitiate the environment of the society. Rejecting the bail application, the court further observed, “Fundamental right is not only the prerogative of beef eaters. Rather, those who worship the cow and are financially dependent on them also have the right to lead a purposeful life. The right to life is above the right to kill and the right to eat beef can never be considered a fundamental right.” The court said, “The government will also have to bring a bill in Parliament and declare cows the national animal and make strict laws against those who talk about harming them. Laws should come for those also who talk about cow protection by making cowsheds, etc., but have nothing to do with cow protection. Their only aim is to earn money in the name of cow protection.” “Cow protection and promotion are not about any one religion, but cow is the culture of India and the work of saving the culture is of every citizen living in the country, irrespective of religion or worship,” the court added. “There are hundreds of examples in our country that whenever we forgot our ‘sanskriti’ (culture), the foreigners attacked us and made us slaves. Even today if we do not wake up, then we should not forget the autocratic Taliban invasion and occupation of Afghanistan,” the court observed. “India is the only country in the world where people of different religions live, who may worship differently, but their thinking is the same for the country and they respect each others’ religions. They respect the customs and food habits. In such a situation, when everyone takes a step forward to unite India and support its faith, then some people who have no faith in the interest of the country, commit such acts to weaken it,” the court further added. Stressing the significance attached to the cow, the court said, “It is not that only Hindus have understood the importance of cows, Muslim rulers have also considered the cow an important part of India’s culture during their reign. Babur, Humayun and Akbar had banned cow slaughter in their religious festivals. Mysure's ruler Hyder Ali had made cow slaughter a cognisable offence. Three members of the cow protection committee set up by the UP government in 1953 were Muslims and committed to total ban on cow slaughter."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cow-should-be-made-national-animal-its-protection-hindus-fundamental-right-hc/articleshow/85850148.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey

The two national boards have split their X and XII board exams into two and bifurcated the syllabuses, each half being covered in each semester in classes X and XII. A proposal for the Higher Secondary exams is being drawn up, weighing the pros and cons of shifting from a centralised public examination system to a more niche semester system. West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education said it was unlikely that the new system would be implemented this academic year, but the proposal would be submitted by the end of this month. Last month, education minister Bratya Basu had said that he had sought a proposal from the council on the semester system. A group of headmasters and government school teachers met council head Chiranjeeb Bhattacharjee last week and provided their inputs. Calls and messages to Bhattacharjee went unanswered but an official said, “The education department sought a proposal and it is being prepared, listing the pros and cons of the shift.” The idea of a semester system in classes XI and XII of state board has received approval from headmasters as well as teachers. “When we met the council president, he sought our views. We said it was a good proposal and would definitely reduce the syllabus burden on students,” said Saugata Basu, general secretary of the West Bengal Government School Teachers’ Association. He pointed out that unlike CISCE or CBSE, the state Plus-II exams were held on the combined syllabuses of classes XI and XII. So, he said, the entire Plus-II could be divided into four semesters. For exams, those for Class XI could be internal assessments and the two in Class XII could be held by the board, he suggested. “The final decision will taken by the education department and the state government. But we will tell them whether it is advisable to shift from a centralised annual public examination to a semester system or not. Also, it will require a completely different eco-system, with training the teachers and overhauling the curriculum,” said the council official. A headmaster pointed out that the education system in the state lacked resources for such a big change. “The curriculum will need a complete overhaul and teachers will have to be trained accordingly.” The pandemic has disrupted educational activities, with all the boards having cancelled their classes X and XII boards exams. Different boards adopted different formulae to evaluate their students, based on different parameters, including a student’s marks in Class X boards and Class XI annual exams. CBSE and CISCE then decided to bifurcate their classes X and XII into two semesters, scheduling the first examination in November and the second ones in March-April next year. While the first exams will be held online, the second one will depend on the Covid situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/edu-dept-weighs-options-for-sem-system-in-xi-xii/articleshow/85847869.cms||Zeeshan Javed

The top 10 performers of this feat of abstinence will win a free pilgrimage tour to Shri Sammed Shikharji in Jharkhand. The challenge’s rationale is to strengthen ties within families by weakening digital distractions besides sharpening concentration sans online interruptions. The results of this 50-day challenge, which began on July 23, will be announced on September 10. Posters heralding the contest have come up outside Jain temples in the Walled City of Ahmedabad. One such was sighted outside Shantinathji Jain Derasar at Haja Patel ni Pol on Relief Road in Kalupur. The first step of the challenge does involve an online step: registration. But after signing up, participants will have to eschew all gadgets — mobiles, laptops, tablets, and phablets — for at least 12 hours a day. On observing the digital fast between 9am and 9pm, one gets 12 points. If the fast lasts from 9pm to 9am the following day, 9 points are awarded. “The aim is to bring forth the foundational values of Jainism and make them relevant to the current generation,” said Ramesh Kumar Shah, founder of jainfoundation.in, who has launched the challenge. “Overall, the competition has drawn about 2,000 registrations including 300 from Gujarat,” he added. Over the past four months, the newly set up foundation has been organising webinars on a variety of topics, including philosophy, Jain religion, rituals, devotion, education, and Jain art and architecture. The challenge is being supported by Jain groups in Ahmedabad, Bangalore, and Chennai. Pravesh Mehta, treasurer of Jain International Trade Organization (JITO), Ahmedabad, said: “It’s an amazing initiative during Paryushan, that will lead the conversation to the optimum use of gadgets. I don’t remember using a mobile phone 20 years ago. We can manage our time without it.” Jitendra Shah, former director of LD Institute of Indology, confirmed that Jain organisations in the city had agreed to promote the concept in Ahmedabad and other places in Gujarat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/digital-fasting-path-to-detox-for-jain-youth/articleshow/85853583.cms||Ashish Chauhan
---||Mumbai||Governor ‘non-committal’ as Maharashtra CM, Ajit Pawar discuss council seats row||MUMBAI: CM Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday made a fresh attempt to break the ice with Governor B S Koshyari over the issue of nominations to the state legislative council, but a senior cabinet member said the governor was non-committal on the appointment of the 12 eminent persons from different walks of life as his nominees. Accompanied by deputy CM Ajit Pawar and revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat, Thackeray met the governor and argued at length on the urgent need for nominations on the council. “The governor gave us a patient hearing, but he was non-committal. We had expected Koshyari will assure us the appointments will be made in a time-bound manner,” the cabinet member told TOI. Ajit Pawar said the delegation brought it to the notice of the governor that in view of the ensuing session of the state legislature, the MVA government would appreciate it if the decision was taken at the earliest. “We urged the governor to fill up the vacancies as early as possible. We expect the governor will take the decision soon,” Pawar said. Besides the nominations, Pawar said there was discussion on the preparedness of the state government for tackling the possibility of a third wave of Covid-19, on floods in parts of Vidarbha, Marathwada and North Maharashtra and relief and rehabilitation measures taken by the MVA government. Recently, Pawar had twice said an MVA delegation would soon call on the governor to discuss the delay in nominations to the council. However, the meeting had not materialized as Koshyari was out of Mumbai. The state cabinet had on November 4 last year recommended the names of 12 persons for the council. An MVA delegation of Eknath Shinde, Amit Deshmukh and Anil Parab on November 6 called on the governor to submit the list. The CM had expected Raj Bhavan would approve the list within a reasonable period. However, as there was no response, the CM, Ajit Pawar and public works minister Ashok Chavan later called on PM Narendra Modi and urged him to direct Koshyari to take a decision as early as possible. On a PIL filed in Bombay high court, the HC did not pass any directives but expressed the view that the governor should decide within a reasonable timeframe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-guv-non-committal-as-cm-ajit-discuss-council-seats-row/articleshow/85850278.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

Offcials said the works would be taken up on each lane of the flyover, mostly during non-peak hours. On Wednesday, the north-bound arm of the flyover had been kept shut, said locals. The traffic police issued a notification prohibiting movement of heavy vehicles, two-wheelers and cyclists on the Ghatkopar-Mankhurd Link Road for a month. For five days, the north-bound stretch of the flyover will be completely shut for the BMC repairs. Thereafter, light vehicles will be allowed at a speed of 30 to 50kmph. Parking is banned. Civic officials said that CCTV cameras, speed-breakers, rumbler strips on both sides of the road, speed sensors and milling works will be carried out to make the flyover surface rough. A BMC official said that the flyover had been built for a speed of 50kmph but often people were found speeding, which could lead to accidents. Along with speed-breakers every 500 metres, there will also be signages indicating the presence of a speed-breaker. The man who died, Yusuf Khan, had a timber business in Mandala, Mankhurd, and was riding pillion with his friend Akhtar Khan from his Shivaji Nagar home towards his shop. Local corporator Ruksana Siddique from Govandi called for bikers to be restricted on the flyover, but other civic representatives said that it would be wrong to restrict any movement and instead works should be carried out to make the road less slippery. Siddique said two-wheelers tend to speed and sought a ban on them on GMLR, just like on JJ flyover. “Recently there were also complaints of locals mishandling the height barriers placed by the BMC,” she said.

The petitioners contended that the examination conducted by the Andhra Pradesh Public Service Commission (APPSC) was in violation of established procedures and the amendments made to the rules by adopting digital evaluation has no legal backing. They sought directions to cancel the examination and to conduct a fresh examination. Arguing on behalf of the petitioners, senior counsel B Adinarayana Rao said the affidavit filed by the chairman of the APPSC itself speaks about how the rules and established procedures were violated. The rules were amended without the approval of the chairman which is arbitrary and illegal. Rao further argued that the secretary of APPSC acted beyond his scope and took decisions contrary to law. Any change in rules has to be approved by the full commission but in the present case, the chairman, who is the head of the institution, was bypassed to authorise the secretary to amend the rules, he said. “Even if assuming that the chairman is not attending the office or not available for the meeting, a member has to be nominated to conduct the meeting and the same has to be notified through a gazette by the governor. The high court said it will hear the matter on a daily basis as the counsel for other petitioners are yet to advance their arguments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hearing-on-pleas-seeking-fresh-group-1-exams-begins/articleshow/85847957.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Pocso court fines mother for backing bail for son’s abusers||MUMBAI: Taking strong objection to a mother submitting an affidavit supporting bail to three men accused of disrobing her 12-year-son, taking his nude videos and uploading them on social media, a special Pocso court has imposed costs of Rs 5,000 on her. The court granted the three men bail on grounds of their young age and that most of the investigations were completed. The court noted, “The mother of the victim boy, after filing the present complaint with such serious allegations, is coming before the court for giving no objection to grant bail to the accused persons, I am of the view that she has misused the state authorities, wasted their time so when the court is deciding to grant bail to the accused, is of the view to impose the cost on the informant.” The court said in addition to surety amount, the release of the accused was subject to the cost being paid by the mother. The court said that a 12-year-old boy was very badly victimized by the trio. “But now as the informant (mother) herself is saying that she does not have any objection to release the accused on bail and their custody also if not required for any recovery or discovery purpose, they can be released on bail,” the court said. It called the crime heinous. The three accused, aged between 20 and 32 years old, live in the child’s neighbourhood. They were arrested on August 3. Opposing their bail plea, the prosecution submitted that after being confronted by the child’s family, they claimed to have taken down the video. However, later it was found to be uploaded on social media. The prosecution said that the process of recording statements of witnesses is going on and a report from the Forensic Scientific Laboratory (FSL) on the video was awaited. The prosecution feared that if released on bail, the accused may tamper with the evidence and defame the child. Imposing conditions, the court said that the trio was not to contact, meet, threaten or cause any harm to the mother, child and their family members in any manner. “They shall not contact to victim through social media. They shall withdraw from the area where the victim boy is residing, going to his class or school,” the Pocso court said.

---||Mumbai||Bombay HC reserves its order in Kangana Ranaut’s quash plea||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Wednesday reserved for orders a quashing petition filed by actor Kangana Ranaut against a criminal defamation proceeding initiated against her on a complaint filed by veteran lyricist Javed Akhtar. Justice Revati Mohite Dere, who heard counsel Rizwan Siddiquee for Ranaut and Jay Bharadwaj for Akhtar, said she would pronounce the final order on September 9. An Andheri magistrate is scheduled to hear the case on September 14. Siddiquee cited 26 judgments from the SC and HCs to argue that the metropolitan magistrate in the Andheri court did not apply his judicial mind while asking for a police inquiry in the private complaint. He argued that police investigation was only required if the case so demands and the magistrate would be duty-bound to record specific reasons for asking for police investigation. Siddiquee asserted that there was no recovery of any evidence and the police, as such, only presented one-sided investigation report, which was in contravention to Section 162 of trhe CrPC, and the magistrate relied on such a report. He stressed that there was non-application of mind in its order to summon Ranaut. She was “never examined” by the magistrate and she never recorded her statement before the police as a witness, said Siddiquee. Akhtar’s counsel Bharadwaj said Ranaut had been asked by the police to give her statement but she had not responded “for reasons best known to her”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-reserves-its-order-in-kanganas-quash-plea/articleshow/85850327.cms||---

Meanwhile, the cops continued their hunt for the sixth accused, who is still at large.Police officers confirmed that a gang of workers, one of whom was a minor, was present at the scene of the crime, and they had an intention to commit an offence. The accused had been lurking around the hillock when the woman, accompanied by her friend, entered, riding on a bike. The entire locality is dimly-lit along the road leading to Lalithadripura village, which roughly a kilometre-and-a-half from the crime scene.The accused, who were in a goods auto, noticed the duo in a secluded spot, and took advantage of the situation by robbing them of their valuables. The accused also demanded a sum of Rs 3 lakh from the duo, police said.Sources, however, said that the accused did not take any valuables. “Criminals are particular about taking cash when they are involved in such crimes since they fear tipping us off while trying to dispose off the stolen goods,” police said.All the six accused, including the 17-year-old, were from Tamil Nadu, a senior police officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/cops-continue-hunt-for-sixth-accused/articleshow/85842947.cms||---

Prior to the incident on August 23, the gang had made a futile attempt at another shop where the owner insisted that they leave footwear outside the shop, which led to an argument between them, the cops added.Cops are yet to arrest one of the culprits.

A jeweller from Mysuru conspired with some people in Bengaluru and Rajasthan to loot a few shops run by people known to him in the city. “How they teamed up and grouped the men from different states is being investigated. So far, eight are booked in the case and of them seven are in police custody,” the officer added.Countrymade pistol was hid in drainInterestingly, police have recovered the pistol used in the crime at the Vidyaranyapuram jewellery shop.

---||Delhi||Delhi HC seeks Centre, Rakesh Asthana’s stand on top cop appointment||NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Wednesday sought the stand of the Centre and Delhi Police chief Rakesh Asthana on a public interest litigation challenging his appointment. A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh issued a notice on a plea filed by one Sadre Alam and listed the matter for further hearing on September 8. The court also allowed advocate Prashant Bhushan to intervene and argue in the matter on behalf of the NGO Centre for Public Interest Litigation (CPIL), which has challenged the appointment before the Supreme Court. During the hearing, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, however, opposed both the petitions, arguing that “intermeddlers” and “professional PIL petitioners” cannot be allowed to challenge the appointment of the Gujarat-cadre IPS officer as Delhi Police Commissioner. “This is not Jantar Mantar or Ramlila Maidan,” the SG contended, adding that the petitioners “have no business challenging the appointment and expressed his misgivings towards “ready-made petitioners” who follow a “systematic pattern” of criticising all government-made appointments. Interestingly, Bhushan also opposed Alam’s plea, claiming that it is a motivated petition only filed to thwart CPIL’s plea. Appearing for the NGO, Bhushan stated that Alam's petition was mala fide and a “complete copy-paste” of the plea pending before the apex court. Even as the high court allowed him to intervene, Bhushan clarified that he did not intend to argue before the court as the NGO’s plea was pending before the Supreme Court. SG Mehta also flagged the issue, arguing that Alam “seems to have copied and followed the dangerous path of Mr Bhushan (NGO’s counsel). The debutant should be stopped.” He told the court that the petitioner must be investigated. “It is very serious... It is too much for a coincidence that the same typographical error was possible,” he added even as he sought time to respond to the petition on merit and said the court has to hear the “affected officer” as well before any order is passed. B S Bagga, counsel for Alam, maintained that the plea was not a product of “copy-paste” and is a genuine petition. The high court, however, refrained from expressing any view on the matter. In his petition before the high court, Alam has sought quashing of the July 27 order issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs appointing Asthana as the Delhi Police Commissioner and also the order granting inter-cadre deputation and extension of service to him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-seeks-centre-asthanas-stand-on-top-cop-appointment/articleshow/85850338.cms||Abhinav Garg
---||Delhi||Nearly 1.4 crore in Delhi have got at least one vaccine dose||NEW DELHI: Over 1.36 crore of the 1.5 crore eligible Delhiites have received at least one dose of Covid vaccine. However, only 38.9 lakh of them are fully vaccinated. Delhi government is trying to expedite the vaccination drive, with more than 1.1 lakh people getting the jab on Wednesday. For the past several days, more than 1 lakh people are being vaccinated every day in the capital and the number of Delhiites having received just one dose now stands at 97.4 lakh. The vaccination drive began in Delhi on January 16 with healthcare workers. Initially, there was hesitation even among healthcare workers about getting vaccinated, but it went away gradually. After healthcare staff, it was the turn of frontline workers, followed by senior citizens and then those above 44. “In the initial months, people battled vaccine hesitancy, and not many turned up. It is one of the reasons behind the low count of fully vaccinated people,” said a health department official. The situation improved after everybody above 18 years were allowed to get the jab from May, he added. The count has also seen a upward trend after experts started urging people to get vaccinated to make the possible third Covid wave less lethal. On Wednesday, more than 1.12 lakh people got the jab till 7pm. The shortage of vaccines has contributed to the problem too. The first dose of both Covaxin and Covishield vaccines were restricted for some time in the capital so that those who had received the first dose could be given the second dose on time. Meanwhile, more men have got the Covid shots than women in Delhi. Among the 1.36 crore Delhiites who have received at least one dose, 78.8 lakh are men and 57.4 lakh women. Over 1 crore people have received Covishield and 31.5 lakh Covaxin. Over 76.2 lakh people who have received at least one of the doses belong to the 18-44 age group while 38.7 lakh to the 45-60 lakh age group. Over 21 lakh individuals who are above 60 years have received at least one dose of vaccine. On Wednesday, 1,165 sites conducted the drive, out of which 990 were government centres and 175 private sites.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/nearly-1-4-cr-in-delhi-have-got-at-least-one-vax-dose/articleshow/85850413.cms||AlokKNMishra

The programme is custom-designed for government employees and vehicles are made available by CESL through its relationship with vehicle manufacturers. All vehicles will benefit from Centre’s subsidy programme FAME II, which allows customers to access a significant subsidy that brings electric vehicles closer to the cost of their fossil fuel equivalents. This programme is carried out in collaboration with Energy Management Centre (EMC), Government of Kerala. The scheme was inaugurated by power minister K Krishnankutty in the presence of MLA VK Prasanth and mayor of Thiruvananthapuram Arya Rajendran amongst other dignitaries. Kerala is the first state in CESL portfolio to move ahead and order two-wheelers. The launch of this scheme, therefore, makes Kerala the first user of the digital marketplace – MyEV which will enable easy access to consumers for booking and buying electric two-wheelers. Special design features have enabled a virtual experience to come as close to being at a showroom – designed to reduce physical visits to retail outlets with the pandemic still looming in India. Interested consumers can visit www.MyEV.org.in or download mobile app: MyEV from Google Play Store. The government too has undertaken several initiatives to increase electric mobility penetration. To reduce vehicular pollution, state government had brought out an electric vehicle policy, directing all departments to switch to electric vehicles instead of purchasing new fuel-based ones. Speaking about this association, Mahua Acharya, MD and CEO, CESL said, “I am glad that Kerala government is taking this initiative with CESL to increase EV penetration in state. EMC has shown great leadership in developing and implementing this programme and such programmes could become trendsetters for the adoption of green mobility across the country.” A four-day exhibition of electric two-wheelers will be organised by EMC & CESL at Institution of Engineers in the capital where the vehicles can be test-driven. Speaking at the inauguration, Krishnankutty said, “The agreement with CESL is a big step towards ushering in a new era of e-mobility in state. Kerala has always been at the forefront of innovation and adapting new technologies.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cesl-launches-scheme-for-govt-employees-to-buy-ev-two-wheelers/articleshow/85848055.cms||---

The committee also found that engaging Sprinklr did not adversely affect the interests of the state. According to the report of K Sasidharan Nair committee, even though the whole responsibility for the engagement of Sprinklr for Covid-19 data management is with former principal secretary of the chief minister Sivasankar, he had no mal-intention while engaging the firm. “No doubt the lapses occurred in engaging Sprinklr for data analysis. However, despite such lapses, on a totality of all facts and materials on record and taking note of the extra-ordinary circumstances prevailing at that point of time, the committee is of the view that no evil design, malice or bad faith can be attributed upon M Sivasankar for his lapses in engaging Sprinklr for data analysis.” The report further said that Sivasankar appears to have pursued the software as a service (SaaS) simply as a product and proceeded to purchase the same on the premise that it was given pro-bono and in his capacity as the head of the electronics and IT department and he was empowered to purchase it by following the provisions of the store purchase manual. The report further said that all activities with Sprinklr continued only for less than a month. “No payment was made to Sprinklr. The Sprinklr activities continued only for less than a month and by April 20, 2020, the entire data was transferred to the state data centre managed by C-DIT, and instructions were also given to destroy data if any remained with Sprinklr forthwith,” it said. The report further said that accordingly, Sprinklr reported compliance with the same and there is no evidence, as of now, to vindicate that the interest of the state was adversely affected due to the engagement of Sprinklr. SaaS has been obtained from M/S Sprinklr without respecting the procedure to be followed by a government department. Also, security concerns were not addressed while engaging the firm. “M Sivasankar and his close associate managing director of KSITL Jayasankar Prasad have not taken care to understand and address the risks and challenges associated with engaging M/S Sprinklr for analysis of structured sensitive health data of citizen but is seen to have given permission right away,” the report said. The government had engaged a two-member committee led by former Union civil aviation secretary M Madhavan Nambiar to look into the issues concerning Sprinklr’s engagement. This committee found that due process was not followed in finalizing the contract, and permission of the chief minister, who was also the IT minister, was not taken before executing an agreement with Sprinklr. “Since we are dealing with data security issues and entrusting sensitive data to a foreign company, this could be detrimental to the state and its citizens,” the earlier committee had found. Chennithala seeks judicial probe:Meanwhile, Congress leader and former opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala said that the report of Sasidharan Nair committee was prepared to give clean chit to the chief minister and M Sivasankar. He demanded that a judicial inquiry should be conducted into the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/sprinklr-pact-did-not-harm-state-panel/articleshow/85848146.cms||---

Only 12,737 candidates have applied for the course. College officials said the reason for the poor demand was low employment and uncertainty over teacher eligibility test (TET). The first merit list for the DEd course will be announced on September 4. The decline in the applications has been constant since the past two years and as a result many colleges conducting the course have discontinued it or shut down. Considering the number of colleges as against the intake in the state, there will be just 21 candidates studying in each college on an average, Vidyadhar Amarnelkar, principal of a teacher training institute in Pune, said. “There are so many education technology start-ups and companies that have been formed during the past two years but they too require experienced teachers. The candidates passing out of this course have to even complete the bachelor’s degree course and in addition have some soft skills also. The edu tech companies are hiring tremendously to cater to their online teaching services in wake of the pandemic, but they may not be hiring freshers,” he said. Till 2009-2010, as soon as candidates passed out of the diploma course they were recruited as teachers. The candidates would benefit as their monthly income would begin. Since 2012, the recruitment of teachers was on freeze in government schools leading to the decline. The TET compulsion came in 2017 and following that year, there was an announcement regarding teacher recruitment for 12,000 posts but in reality only 5,000 posts were filled. “For one decade, the teacher recruitment has been very poor since 2010 and as a result of this aspirants have been turning their backs towards the course. There are lakhs of candidates who have passed out of D Ed colleges in these 10 years and are jobless. Many did the course to take up teaching as a profession however ended up switching to other jobs after the poor recruitment,” Vivek Kale, principal of another D Ed college, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/colleges-fret-over-poor-response-to-ded-course-fuelled-by-lack-of-jobs/articleshow/85848108.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Nagpur||Engg & other colleges fail to deposit PF amount of employees||Nagpur: Even as Nagpur University failed to act against colleges retrenching its teaching and non-teaching staff, it has come to fore that many of them had failed to deposit their provident fund amount. On the other hand, one more engineering college, running exclusive courses for women, sacked four teachers in complete violation of norms, as per NU officials. An interim report submitted by the panel of NU’s management council (MC) members, constituted to probe several complaints by teachers and other employees against the engineering and other colleges, confirmed the fact. A couple of MC members told TOI that an engineering college in Wardha hadn’t paid salaries to the staff since the last three years when there was no sign of any pandemic. Many colleges have resorted to this tactic citing the Covid-19 pandemic. Earlier, Priyadarshini Group’s engineering college had sacked six teachers citing the same reason. Shikshan Manch members led by its coordinator Kalpana Pande recently met higher education minister Uday Samant and requested him to look into this issue. Manch members, who are in majority in all NU statutory bodies by way of nomination, have threatened to launch an agitation if sacked teachers aren’t reinstated. Earlier, Nagpur University Teachers’ Association (NUTA) had staged a demonstration in front of new NU’s new Academic building. The sacking of teachers was hotly debated in the MC meeting on Monday with members, including Rajesh Bhoyar, Nitin Kongre, Vishnu Changde and others forcing the NU administration to issue a letter to all colleges to release pending salaries within eight days. The meeting was later adjourned till September 8 to take a review on whether the colleges, including ten named by the NU panel, have complied with the university’s directives. It was also decided to issue a show cause notice to the colleges in case of their failure to release pending wages. NU registrar Raju Hiwse then issued letters to Priyadashini Group’s colleges, along with Guru Nanak Engineering College and Annasaheb Gundewar Collge on Tuesday to immediately release employees’ wages and withdraw any disciplinary action on them. TOI had reported on August 28 on how engineering and other colleges allegedly harassed its teaching and non-teaching staff by not paying salaries since last year citing the pandemic. The report made scathing observations that the college managements had victimized those who dared to lodge complaints against them with NU. They were not only threatened, but also not allowed to conduct online classes for the students. Even their entry inside college premises was barred, the report mentioned. A few of them were issued notices by their managements seeking explanation from them for disclosing the reality. NAAC team to visit NU today The six-member NAAC team will visit the university for assessment on Thursday. The team would interact with the VC in the morning where he would show them a presentation on infrastructure and facilities in NU. The team would later meet members of NU’s various statutory bodies like management and board of studies. In their three-day tour, they would be visiting various NU departments and colleges and also interact with the students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/engg-other-colleges-fail-to-deposit-pf-amount-of-employees/articleshow/85848103.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

People have now realized that vaccine provides effective protection against infectious diseases. As a result, the demand for adult vaccination, seasonal inoculation of kids and not-so-popular vaccines like Hepatitis B etc has increased. “A significantly high number of people are enquiring about adult immunization. Even the takers for adult vaccination has gone up in the last few months,” said infectious disease specialist Dr Aswini Tayade, who has been working on adult vaccination for more than a decade now. According to her, the awareness about adult vaccines against seasonal flu, pneumococcal disease, diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis has increased. “Covid-19 pandemic had been an eye-opener for all of us on importance of prevention and protection given by vaccines,” she said.Paediatrician Dr Sanjay Marathe said vaccines have scripted many success stories in his field of work, but initial success of Covid-19 vaccine is thr most recent and has helped adults develop faith in vaccines. “Great examples like eradication of chickenpox and polio developed wide acceptance for paediatric vaccination in our country. On the same lines, the success of Covid-19 vaccine has created a ground for adult vaccination,” he said, adding that a nationwide policy for adult vaccination is the need of the hour.Dr Sudarshan Chavan, who works in a government set-up, said people in rural areas have also realized that vaccines can be multi-beneficial. “There was no vaccine available in the first wave. We got the vaccine just before the second wave. Doctors were the first to take it. After vaccination, most doctors in rural PHCs started serving with a sense of security and confidence. This change was observed by people too,” he said.As mortality due to Covid-19 in doctors and health workers reduced after vaccination, people developed faith that vaccines do work.“After the second wave, almost 80% of the eligible population in my PHC area has vaccine protection. People are now seeing that hospital beds are vacant and oxygen requirement has gone down. This is all due to vaccine and they want it now,” Dr Chavan added.Physician Dr Priti Gorlawar said the Covid phase made many people aware that vaccines are available not just for children but for adults as well. “A considerable population was unaware that vaccines are available for adults. I hope, the post-pandemic phase will bring this awareness and preventive medicine will get its due attention soon,” she said.Doctors said adult immunization saves three million lives every year and reduces mortality due to infectious diseases even better than antibiotics. Protection from infectious diseases reduces direct and indirect medical costs, hospitalization load, and severe illnesses. As the spread gets controlled, even unvaccinated people get indirect protection.Vaccines workCovid-19 vaccination is just 8-month-old in India, but it has brought a major changeInstances of severe disease, hospitalization, oxygen requirements have gone downMortality rate has also gone down significantly post vaccination People have started developing faith not only in Covid vaccine, but in vaccines at largeIf a vaccine developed in 2 years can protect, tried & tested vaccines developed in the past must be effective Demand, enquiries, awareness for adult vaccination has increased||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/as-faith-in-vaccines-develops-demand-for-adult-immunization-goes-up/articleshow/85845475.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Pune||Life is a screen from morn to night for older students||Pune: Most 14-years-old are glued to desktops from 8am to 9pm, taking breaks only for lunch and the wash room between various classes. While the time till afternoon is occupied by school lectures, the evenings are taken up by mathematics tuition and entrance exam coaching that they may take four years down the line. It was no different when they had offline classes, but cushioned by interacting with friends without constant parental supervision, something that online education has robbed them of, experts have observed. The mother of a 14-year-old said everybody is starting early for JEE coaching in the hope that it will ease the pressure on students when they are in Std XI and XII. “We have put no pressure on out son to appear for the exam. But he should be prepared for it. Students are used to online classes now and he plays in the evening with his friends,” she said. Parents and teachers of children in this age group run into technical knowledge issues. Children can easily log in to the online classes and yet completely ignore the teachers by starting separate chat boxes with friends, playing games or accessing anything on the internet. Tough On Teachers Jayshree Venkatraman, principal at SNBP International School, said there are a range of issues with online schooling. Initially, teachers were clueless about what students were doing during online classes. They would switch off their videos and we would not force them to switch it on because there is always a possibility that the child is from a humble background and does not want friends to know about it, she said. “But, we soon realised that a lot of students were not attentive during lectures. To counter it, we started a special period after school hours where five students interact with one teacher. It starts with the teacher telling these students to solve a worksheet on what has been taught and then goes on to casual talk. This helps teachers understand who is attentive and who is not. It also builds a rapport between the teachers and students, and makes students more accountable,” she added. Online schooling is placing immense stress on students and their parents who are unable to accept that virtual academics is possible. It is causing anxiety and building pressure. “Our school counsellor had to tell the parent of a Std VIII student to seek professional help apart from keeping a watch on his activities as he had developed suicidal tendencies. Secondly, the examination structure is different. Now, we do not have essays and MCQs have replaced long answers. So parents and students are dissatisfied even when they score high, there is no sense of achievement. The students miss the approval and applause of their peers when answering a question in class or scoring high during exams. All this matters,” Venkatraman said. Socialising Suffers The Most Shlok Parmar, who passed Std X and is waiting for his FYJC admissions, said he had kept his online classes to a minimum and concentrated more on self-study during Std X to score 99.2%. But he was stressed about his peers, and some friends, cheating during the exam to score good marks while he wrote them sincerely and there was no check on this. “I missed social interactions with friends. I missed the games period. I had online classes from 8am till noon and tuition on alternate days. I used my parents’ phone to limit distractions. Many friends did not attend to their studies since they were distracted by individual phones. Hence, online classes and gadgets are tricky,” Parmar said. Set Rules, Stick To Them Experts agree that it is not easy for parents to monitor or control screen time. But setting time limits and sticking to them help.  They maintain that ground rules like an hour or so of television, 30 minutes of texting with friends, make the rules clear and set limits for screen time. They will beg and whine and bargain for more time to chat with friends, watch a favourite show, or play one more video game, but parents must be as firm and consistent in refusing as possible, according to a website on parenting. Children at this age demand more space and privacy. But some control over televisions or any tech screen device in their rooms must be exercised. Research indicates that a television set in a bedroom can lead to poor marks, sleeping problems, and obesity. Also parents can be firm about not allowing iPads, smartphones, or any other devices in their room, most parenting websites advise. Research shows that viewing content with a child and actively discussing themes, thinking about what's viewed critically, and talking about the effects and meaning of the viewed content is one of the best types of monitoring parents can do, a website advised.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/life-is-a-screen-from-morn-to-night-for-older-students/articleshow/85848086.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Nagpur||‘Let festive spirit, not crowd, be the criteria for festivities’||When it comes to festival celebrations, Indians like to do everything king size. Crowd is one of the most popular parameters to analyse the success or grandeur of any celebrations. Ahead of the festive season, Vidya Vachaspati Prof Swanand Gajanan Pund, authority on theology, and especially on Lord Ganesha, spoke to TOI and shared some insights. Is there any basis or importance of public celebration of festivities like Ganesh Utsav from the theological point of view? The very nature of this festival is public celebration. Like-minded people are expected to come together and celebrate such festivities. It has different social significance such as mutual affection, exchange of happiness and sorrow, creation of togetherness, display of one’s virtues in front of others etc. We can’t completely disown public celebrations of festivals. Shouldn’t celebrations be low-key due to the pandemic? It’s really difficult to digest that the only field still under strict restrictions is religious activities. I appeal to devotees to use their wisdom and continue to be vigilant. Festivals must be celebrated otherwise there will be a notion that no other activity but only religious gatherings spread Covid.Are gatherings unavoidable during festivities? Theology never says that a huge crowd means a huge celebration. This is manipulation of our ideas. It comes from the tendency to show off everything which has come in modern times. Competition for giant idols gave birth to the POP monster, competition to show off strength brought huge pandal decorations. This resulted in forced donations. We must understand that loud music in processions, obscene dances and many such things are associated with the festival in modern times. Theology does not advocate such practices.In what way should festivals be celebrated? The Dharmashastra says the land should be sanctified with cow dung, decorated with banana poles, mango leaves and flags – all naturally available, pollution-free goods. There is no mention in the scriptures about POP or big idols or loud celebrations. Theology talks about clay idols. Clay has its own limitations when it comes to the height of the idol. Plastic, thermocol have nothing to do with theology. This year, considering the pandemic situation, taking care of health is most important. We have to be more careful. The pandemic has given us an opportunity to think about how the nature of the festival can be changed from ostentation to pure devotion.Is it permissible to immerse the idol in clean water at home?According to the scriptures, immersion of a clay idol in flowing water is a spiritual process. Unfortunately, we have polluted our rivers in such a manner that they have become drainage lines. In such times, it would be more appropriate to immerse idols in pure water at home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/let-festive-spirit-not-crowd-be-the-criteria-for-festivities/articleshow/85845528.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Pune||RTO expects ease in tracking & taxing outstation vehicles with BH numbers||Pune: Transport authorities say the new BH (Bharat) registration series will make it easy for them to track vehicles registered in other states but operating in the city and impose road tax on them. As per the Regional Transport Office (RTO) in Pune, 3,000-4,000 vehicles bearing registration numbers of other states are operating in Pune for long without changing the registration. “Is is difficult to ascertain if a vehicle with the registration number of a different state is operating in Maharashtra for long. Whenever stopped, most of such vehicle owners say they have come to Pune recently,” an RTO official said.  The BH series will come into effect from September 15. It will allow people having central or state government jobs, and also those with private firms having offices in minimum four cities, to get the BH series number. Those in defence services can also get such numbers. “One has to apply for the BH number online. A person with the BH number will have to first pay the tax for two years and subsequently in multiple of two, instead of paying for 15 years,” the official said. “If a person is relocating to a city after, for example, three years, the parent state now has to refund the tax of 12 years. In the new state, the person has to pay the tax for 13 years. Those with BH numbers will be spared of the process,” he said. Raviraj Sharma, an IT professional who came to Pune from Indore one-and-a-half years ago, said, “I will apply for the BH number, as my office is a multi-national firm with branches in over 10 states.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rto-expects-ease-in-tracking-taxing-outstation-vehicles-with-bh-numbers/articleshow/85848133.cms||Joy Sengupta

When the lockdown was declared in March last year, Kumar was in the middle of his final Class VII exams. His days in Class VIII after promotion were spent getting notes on WhatsApp and talking to teachers over the phone and through messaging. As he sat on the last bench of Class IX on the ground floor at Government Boys’ Senior Secondary School in Ghitorni, Kumar happily answered questions asked by his Sanskrit teacher, though at times his efforts were hampered by the mask that he constantly wore. Most government schools and few private schools opened their gates for students of classes IX to XII on Wednesday. The rain seemed to have hit the attendance and not everyone reported back to school but for those who did, it was a welcome difference from studying at home on phones. “I am so glad to be back in school and not have to worry about the internet and about data,” Kumar told TOI. The father, a security guard, had provided Kumar and his brother, who studies in class XI in the same school, with one Android phone for their studies. “We used to recharge the phone every three months and get access to 1.5GB data every day,” said the Class IX student. “The classes on Zoom consumed more data, but my brother and I managed somehow.” Before his brother’s online classes began, Kumar would quickly complete his worksheet sent on WhatsApp by his school. Delhi schools sent such worksheets on phone to all students of nursery to Class VIII. Those who didn’t own a smartphone had to collect them from school. Kuldeep Sharma’s father, a carpenter, left his phone behind for his son to use. “But I didn’t like online classes so much,” said Sharma. “I have been wanting to go back to school for a long time. I was missing the class environment and my friends.” Sunil Kumar Joon, English teacher at the Ghitorni school, expected more students to be back in school by next week. At Government Girls’ Senior Secondary School in Ambedkar Nagar too, the head of the school, Aruna Anand, said, “By Monday, there will be more clarity on how many students will be returning to the school for offline classes.” But students who don’t come back won’t miss out on lessons. As Joon revealed, the teachers are planning to get tripods for their phones to enable them to transmit the classes live through Zoom.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/jail-break-glad-to-be-back-at-school/articleshow/85850481.cms||Shradha Chettri

Jain held a meeting with the public works department (PWD) to take some key decisions on the seven hospitals that Delhi government is constructing as part of the preparations to tackle the possible third wave of Covid-19. These hospitals are being built at Sarita Vihar, Shalimar Bagh, Sultanpuri, Kirari, Raghubir Nagar, GTB Hospital campus and Chacha Nehru Bal Chikitsalaya. “All seven hospitals will be completely modular. All steel and concrete material structures will be manufactured in factories and assembled at the site, which will boost the construction speed,” Jain said. The meeting was held to ensure that all seven hospitals could be ready at the earliest. “Precast building materials are strong and save a lot of time. These are ready-made blocks of concrete that are brought to the construction site where they are assembled to give a final shape. All steel structures will also be manufactured in factories.” In-house green sewage treatment plants with zero liquid discharge will also be built at the hospitals, he added. “The STPs will be devoid of any foul odour and will consume very little power to function. All hospitals will use energy-efficient five-star electric appliances.” The hospitals will also have a provision of the camera connected with every patient’s bed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-govt-adopts-precast-technique-to-push-construction-of-seven-hospitals/articleshow/85850495.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The MSF leaders had made anti-women and sexually-coloured remarks against women leaders of the organization. The stand taken by Haritha leaders has put IUML in a fix with many leaders viewing it as an act of non-compliance of the party’s decision. Last Wednesday, IUML state general secretary PMA Salam announced a ‘reconciliation’ agreement which stated that Haritha leaders will withdraw their complaint given to the women's commission and the party will not take further action against MSF leaders. Also, the party will withdraw its decision to freeze the state committee of Haritha. But, Haritha leaders felt that they hadn’t received justice as IUML hadn’t taken disciplinary action against the MSF leaders. Also, they felt that the regret expressed by the three leaders, as per the ‘reconciliation’ pact, actually amounted to disparaging them as there was not even a sincere admission of having committed a wrong. As per the agreement announced by IUML, the three leaders were to express their regret on social media and Haritha leaders were to withdraw their complaint. But, Haritha leaders were maintaining that they will withdraw the complaint only after the party takes action against MSF state president PK Navas against whom they had raised the complaint. Meanwhile, IUML is set to discuss the issue at the next meeting of the party’s high-power committee. “The high power committee will discuss the matter of non-withdrawal of the complaint and what steps are to be taken,” said senior IUML leader ET Mohammed Basheer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/haritha-not-to-withdraw-plaint-against-msf-leaders/articleshow/85848204.cms||---

Lakadganj police have pasted pamphlets at the red-light area appealing the sex workers to desist from flesh trade as it’s now being made illegal through a notification issued by CP Amitesh Kumar. The cops also reminded them of their duties towards their children. Apart from cautioning them against participating in sex work at brothels, the cops have also asked them to refrain from spoiling their daughters’ childhood and education. The cops have also warned against abetting the sex work at brothels. Zonal DCP Lohit Matani said police are only facilitating rehabilitation process and not forcing anyone. “We have informed different government agencies like skill development to help women who want to voluntarily walk out of the trade,” he said. “Rehabilitation is just a suggestion from police department for which we will try to extend assistance. It’s the choice of the sex workers to embrace rehabilitation but brothels cannot be operated for flesh trade,” he added. While cops reminded the sex workers of their notifications banning prostitution, Maharaja of Nagpur Raje Mudhoji Bhosale has written to CP Kumar pointing out that stopping sex work without a proper plan is not conducive to humanity. He has also underlined the historical aspect of Ganga Jamuna which is almost three centuries old now. Bhosale also stated that assault on women may see a spurt too. Meanwhile, Sangharsh Vahini activist Mukund Adewar has questioned cops’ claim of facilitating rehabilitation. “Police department has got noting to do with rehabilitation process for which there are differnt agencies working,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/dont-rob-your-daughters-childhood-cops-to-sex-workers/articleshow/85845572.cms||Soumitra Bose

The physical edition of BIFF will be held between October 6 and 15. The Bengali film is one of the 11 selected works in the New Currents section. It is a main competition section at BIFF and has become an entry point for capable directors over the past 25 years in the discovery of new Asian films. It is nominated for the New Currents Awards, the New Currents Audience Award, the NETPAC award and the FIPRESCI Award. The other Indian film that is competing in this section is titled ‘Pedro’. According to Anjan Bose, the managing director of the 115-year-old Aurora Film Corporation, this selection will give a boost to young filmmakers trying to “find a new language in Bengali cinema”. “Through mythological allegory and spiritual subtext, I’m glad these two youngsters made a film that explored themes like reality and illusion, instinct and morality, love, loneliness and grief in the times of pandemic,” Bose said. ‘Kalkokkho’, starring Tannistha Biswas, Sreelekha Mukherji, Janardan Ghosh, Amit Saha, Ahana Karmakar and Deep Sarkar, traces what happens when a doctor is locked in a house inhabited by three women from different age groups during the pandemic. So, there is a paranoid young woman, an old lady suffering from amnesia and a lonely girl. Dialogues highlight various facets of the pandemic, including the angst of migrant workers and why they walked miles to return home, the pangs of families of frontline workers distanced from home and the plight of poor children who have no access to online education. Sarmistha Maiti and Rajdeep PaulAccording to Paul, the concept of social isolation is alien for senior citizens. “In the beginning of the lockdown, everyone was panic-stricken. Viral videos of ill-equipped hospitals played in our mind and many of us had a feeling that our lives would be safer if we had a doctor at home,” he said. That became the genesis of their script. “The doctor became a metaphor in our film for our urge to cling on to a saviour,” he added. During the lockdown, Maiti realized that unlike movies, apocalypse in real life is “boring” and resembles a “slow-paced art film”. “On top of that is the paranoia. The life of my seven-year-old daughter got locked during the lockdown. The physical presence of her friend circle disappeared and everything became virtual for her.

He has also pointed out that real beneficiaries of housing schemes. Inamdar, who is known to have independent views at times, wrote the letter to state rural housing minister Kunvarji Bavalia. He also shared a video regarding his letter on social media. The MLA has stated in the letter that partiality had prevailed when the BPL score was made earlier. He pointed out that deserving people had been left out and were unable to take benefit of government schemes. On the housing front, Inamdar said that beneficiaries of the lists made in the initial phase should be prioritised. He said that the situation today was much different than that time. He stressed on the need of ensuring those who really deserve got houses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/mla-wants-govt-to-plug-holes-in-bpl-scores/articleshow/85842816.cms||---
---||Delhi||Keeping close watch on situation: Sisodia||New Delhi: After monitoring the experiences of the reopening of schools for senior students, a decision on opening the schools for other classes will be taken, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said on Wednesday. Schools reopened after a gap of almost 18 months for classes IX to XII. “Schools were closed for the last 1.5 years due to the pandemic. During this time, there has been a lot of damage to the education of the children. We are concerned about the health of the children and also their education. If schools and colleges are not opened now, then an entire generation will move forward with a knowledge gap. We are in full alert mode and it will be ensured in all schools that Covid-related protocols are followed. Based on the experiences of the first round, the decision on opening schools for other classes will be taken,” said Sisodia. He added that schools are being opened with 50 per cent capacity, but once the protocols become a habit among children, they will be opened with full capacity. “Many experts believe the risk of Covid in children is low. Keeping this in view, schools can be opened for primary classes starting from 100-150 schools. But, the government will decide to open schools for primary classes only on the basis of the experience of opening schools for higher grades,” said the deputy CM. Sisodia stressed that teaching will not begin immediately after schools reopen. In the first 2-3 days, focus will be on the students’ social-emotional well-being. “No school can force children to physically attend the classes without their parents’ approval. Also, all the academic activities will continue to run offline as well as online,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/keeping-close-watch-on-situation-sisodia/articleshow/85850517.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||Poor air shrinking your life by 7 years||Kolkata: Cleaning up the city’s air through effective policies that stamp out pollution sources and reduces fossil fuel emissions can add up to seven years in a Kolkatan’s life. That is the loss in life expectancy that citizens in Kolkata current face due to high pollution level. Just meeting the standards on particulate pollution set by the World Health Organisation can help achieve the goal, the latest Air Quality Life Index (AQLI) report has revealed. Developed by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC), AQLI is a pollution index that translates particulate air pollution into its impact on life expectancy. The report revealed that Kolkata has the second-highest life expectancy loss after Delhi among Indian metro cities in 2019. While Delhi lost 9.7 years of life expectancy, it stood at 7.3 years for Kolkata. The AQIL findings are rooted in recent research that qualifies the relations between long-term exposure to air pollution and life expectancy. Particulate pollution, the report said, has a more devastating impact on life expectancy than communicable diseases like tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS and behavioural killers like smoking and even war.  Because of high annual concentration of PM2.5 particulate matter — 84.8µg/m3 in 2019 — the potential loss in Kolkata’s life expectancy was 7.3 years for not meeting the WHO annual standard of 10µg/m3, the global report revealed. According to the report, Bengaluru has the best air quality, with its life expectancy loss of 2.9 years. Alarmingly, India’s high levels of air pollution is expanded geographically over time. Compared to a couple of decades ago, particulate pollution is no longer a feature of the Indo-Gangetic plains alone. Pollution has increased by leaps and bounds in states like Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. For example, the average person in those states is now losing an additional 2.5 to 2.9 years of life expectancy. According to the AQLI report, South Asia is home to the most polluted countries on earth, with Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan accounting for nearly a quarter of global population and consistently ranking among the top five most-polluted countries in the world. According to AQLI, the estimated impacts are even greater across northern India, the region that experiences extreme levels of air pollution. However, the report underlined some policy actions in place. Compared to 2018, 2017 and 2016, the life expectancy of the city has improved. In 2018, the PM2.5 concentration was 103.6µg/m3 and life expectancy loss was 9.2 years. In 2017, pollution level was 94.8µg/m3 and life expectancy loss was 8.3 years. In 2016, the pollution level was 108.2µg/m3 with life expectancy loss at 9.6 years. “The bad news is that the greatest impacts of air pollution remain concentrated in South Asia. But the good news is that governments in this region are recognizing the severity of the problem and are now beginning to respond,” says Ken Lee, the director of AQLI. “The Indian government’s National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) is an important step towards cleaner air and longer lives as is the establishment of the new Commission for Air Quality Management in the NCR.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/poor-air-shrinking-your-life-by-7-years/articleshow/85845602.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

Citizens’ Park (Mohor Kunja) next to Victoria Memorial was open and some people did turn up to saunter around. Tanusree Bose, a PG student and a resident of Bhowanipore, reached Citizens’Park at 5 pm along with her friends and spent an hour there. According to Bose, it was refreshing to simply loiter around or get engaged in an adda session. But scores of citizens, from elderly citizens who have difficulty waking up in the morning to homemakers who have busy morning schedules, turned up in places like Deshapriya Park, Rawdon Square and Nature Park only to be disappointed to see the gates shut. “After reading about the KMC decision in the newspaper on Wednesday morning, I decided to walk down to Deshapriya Park in the evening. But I found the gates locked. KMC should have first got its act together and then made the announcement,” said Raju Bose, a local resident who was clearly irked by the lack of coordination between the decision-making body at KMC and the staff on the ground. According to a senior official in the KMC parks department, an order was passed on to local KMC offices for reopening of parks under their jurisdiction. “We need to check what went wrong. If need be, we will send fresh reminders to our local offices so that parks are reopened at the earliest,” the civic official said. Lawyer Ankit Agarwal, who wound up work early to reach Rawdon Square first and then Nature Park, was disappointed to find both padlocked. “I hope KMC sorts out the issue quickly. Parks should remain open from 5am to 8pm because it is the safest place to be in and exercise at the time of pandemic. Closed places like gyms are open till 8pm, malls and restaurants till 10.30pm. So it does not make sense to keep parks off bounds,” he said. Parents, too, are frustrated that curbs on children to enter parks have not been lifted. A cross-section of citizens, including school principals, NGOs that dealt with mental health of children, physicians and counsellors as well as parents of special children, had written to KMDA, urging children be allowed to access Rabindra Sarobar that has been off-limits to kids for over a year and a half. But nothing had worked out yet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/citizens-fret-as-local-parks-stay-shut-on-first-day-of-reopening/articleshow/85845607.cms||Saikat Ray

The slow speed of work and obstacles in the project due to the pandemic have led to the exit of the consultant. “The process to appoint a new consultant is underway. The terms and conditions for the tenders would be approved at the administration level in the next couple of days and after that the bids will be invited. The appointment of a new consultant may be completed in around a month,” said Nandakumar Jagtap, a senior official of the water department, who is coordinating the 24X7 water supply project. The project has not progressed as per expectations ever since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. The civic body had appointed the consultant for a fee of Rs18 crore. The new appointment is likely to take at least another month. According to PMC officials, around 25% of the project work has been completed. Based on the time table, around 40% work should have been completed by now. “Non-availability of labour hampered the project work. The raw material was made available at a very high cost due to the lockdown and other restrictions. It has adversely affected the ground-level work on the 24X7 water supply project,” said a PMC official. The official added that payment of consultancy charges was to be made in different works. Some charges were given to complete the detailed project report (DPR). The remaining charges were to be given for monitoring in installments based on the progress of the project. Since project works were not taking place as per expectations, civic body had kept the payment on hold. The consultant had the option of leaving the project due to force majeure as per a clause in the contract. As per PMC officials, the civic body has planned the 24X7 water supply project for areas located in the municipal limits. It must be carried out for equitable water supply across the city. The project includes construction of 103 tanks as well as laying of 1,600km pipeline network and water meters. The civic administration is expected to spend around Rs3,000 crore on the initiative. The work to construct 83 tanks under the equitable water supply system has already been started. The tanks are located across municipal areas. The work on building the remaining tanks is stuck due to issues such as non-availability of land. The process of laying the pipeline and install meters has commenced. The work is being carried out across civic areas, mainly in the Peth areas and localities around Ahmednagar road, Satara road and Solapur road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/consultant-pulls-out-of-pmcs-24x7-water-supply-project/articleshow/85848205.cms||Prasad Kulkarni
---||Dehradun||U’khand among top 3 ‘most polluted’ Himalayan states, Tripura first: Report||Dehradun: Data from the Air Quality Life Index (AQLI) report, released by the Energy Policy Institute, University of Chicago (EPIC) on Wednesday has revealed that Uttarakhand has one of the highest concentrations of PM (particulate matter) 2.5 among the Himalayan states. In fact, among Himalayan states, only Assam and Tripura have higher levels of air pollutants than Uttarakhand. AQLI is based on research that quantifies the causal relationship between long-term human exposure to air pollution and life expectancy. The report found that in 2019, PM 2.5 in Uttarakhand was at 48 ug/m3, cutting short life expectancy of its residents by 3.7 years. In Assam — which recorded a PM 2.5 of 50 ug/m3 — and Tripura, where PM 2.5 levels were 53 ug/m3, life expectancy is declining by 3.9 years and 4.2 years respectively. The report also found that India’s high levels of air pollution have expanded geographically over time. Compared to a couple of decades ago, particulate pollution is no longer a feature of the Indo-Gangetic plains alone, it said. The report listed PM 2.5 concentrations in various other Himalayan states like Himachal Pradesh (40 ug/m3), Arunachal Pradesh (27 ug/m3), Meghalaya (47 ug/m3), Manipur (32 ug/m3), Mizoram (33 ug/m3), Sikkim (42 ug/m3) and Nagaland (32 ug/m3). The air pollutant levels in Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh (which are now Union Territories) were at 36 ug/m3 and 12 ug/m3 respectively, the report said. In Uttarakhand, Udham Singh Nagar — which houses the industrial hub of Rudrapur — was found to have the highest concentration of PM 2.5 at 64 ug/m3 followed by Haridwar at 63 ug/m3. The lowest PM 2.5 levels were recorded in Chamoli at 27.2 ug/m3 followed by Rudraprayag (27.7 ug/m3). The state capital of Dehradun recorded PM 2.5 concentration at 44 ug/m3. The average life expectancy in Dehradun is getting shortened by 3.3 years due to the air pollution levels as per the report. According to the report, if WHO standards are met, US Nagar can improve the average life expectancy of its residents by 5.3 years while Haridwar can improve it by 5.2 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-among-top-3-most-polluted-himalayan-states-tripura-first-report/articleshow/85843106.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||Delhi||Delhi: Oxygen plants with 100MT capacity to be up and running by next month||NEW DELHI: By next month, oxygen plants of around 100 metric tonnes (MT) capacity are likely to be operational in Delhi as part of the preparations to counter a likely third wave of Covid-19 cases. The biggest of these pressure swing adsorption (PSA) plants is coming up in an oxygen centre in northwest Delhi’s Siraspur area with 12.5 MT generation capacity and a 57 MT storage facility. The Delhi government is ramping up the national capital’s oxygen production, storage and transportation infrastructure with an eye on the likely third Covid-19 wave. As part of the preparations, 158 PSA plants are coming up in Delhi, which include a large number of plants at both Delhi government-run and private hospitals, apart from central government hospitals. While 31 PSA plants in various locations are fully functional, 57 more plants are ‘on the way’ and are expected to become operational next month. These include 26 PSA plants allotted to Delhi under PM-CARES fund, out of which 17 have been commissioned, sources said. “The 57 MT oxygen storage centre in Siraspur will also have the biggest oxygen generation plant. The plant is largely complete but some work, such as certification from Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO), is awaited,” an official said. “PESO gives certification in two stages. The first is a pre-construction certificate and the second is given when the plant is ready and gets approval that it is safe to operate,” he said. “The Siraspur centre would also function as an important oxygen refilling unit as medical oxygen coming from Haryana could be kept in the storage and used to refill small tankers. Apart from Siraspur, similar storage facilities will be available at the Delhi government’s Guru Tegh Bahadur, Deen Dayal Upadhyay, Babasaheb Ambedkar, Satyawadi Harishchandra and Maharishi Valmiki hospitals,” he said. In the month of June, CM Arvind Kejriwal had announced that as part of large-scale preparations in case the city has to battle a third wave of Covid-19 cases, the buffer medical oxygen storage capacity will be enhanced by 421 MT. The government is also creating a fleet of oxygen cryogenic tankers of its own and Delhi Transport Corporation has been entrusted with procuring and operating tankers. To begin with, 15 such tankers are being procured, with five each of 10, 15 and 20-tonne capacity. As the capital was gasping for breath during the second wave of Covid-19 cases in April and May this year, the additional allocation of oxygen to Delhi was made from the plants located more than 1,500 km from the city in areas such as Durgapur, Rourkela arid Kalinga Nagar. Transporting the oxygen from these plants to Delhi proved to be a big challenge and containerised cargo movement through railways was also used for bringing liquid medical oxygen to the city. The Delhi government also imported 6,000 oxygen cylinders from China in May, which can be used by individuals in need or used to prepare 3,000 oxygen beds if Covid-19 cases rise again. Five thousand more oxygen concentrators of 10 litre capacity each are also being procured.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/o2-plants-with-100mt-capacity-to-be-up-and-running-by-next-month/articleshow/85850547.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Delhi||All At Sea: Sept High Plunges Delhi To New Low||New Delhi: The superlatives related to weather continue to pile up. On Wednesday, it was the turn to add to the recent records the highest single-day rainfall in September in 19 years. The Safdarjung station measured Wednesday morning’s heavy downpour in the 24 hours till 8.30am at 112.1mm. The 76.5mm of rainfall recorded between then and 5.30pm took September’s total to 188.6mm, already exceeding the historical monthly average by 45%.Before Wednesday’s second consecutive day of ‘heavy’ rainfall, or a 24-hour measure of over 64.5mm, the previous highest was 126.8mm in 2002. The all-time record for the highest precipitation in a single day occurred on September 16, 1963, with 172.6mm. Since India Meteorological Department logs rainfall in a 24-hour cycle till 8.30am on any particular day, the downpour recorded after 8.30am on Wednesday will be part of Thursday’s record.Apart from Safdarjung, six other stations of the Met department, Palam, Lodhi Road, Ridge, Ayanagar, Pitampura and Sports Complex, also logged ‘heavy’ rain till 8.30am. Lodhi Road and Palam also received heavy showers of 75.8mm and 80.6mm, respectively, between 8.30am and 5.30pm. The Ridge, Ayanagar, Pitampura and Sports Complex stations recorded ‘moderate’ rain in the same period. With two consecutive days of heavy rain, and with Tuesday’s rainfall after 8.30am being counted towards Wednesday’s measure, Safdarjung station, the base of Delhi, has already achieved its normal average rainfall for the entire month. “We have received 188.6 mm rainfall till 5.30pm in September and the Safdarjung average is now 45% in excess of the monthly record,” said a Met official. However, Safdarjung recorded 214.5mm rainfall in August against the normal of 247.7mm rainfall, a deficit of 13%. There was 141% excess rainfall measured in July. There will be some respite after two days of heavy rain, with light to moderate rain predicted for the next two days. The Met department has forecast moderate rain or thundershowers on Thursday and light rain on Friday. However, rain is unlikely from August 4 to 6, but rain activity might intensify again from August 7, when light to moderate rain is expected. Delhi’s air quality, meanwhile, remained in the ‘satisfactory’ category. The overall Air Quality Index (AQI) on Wednesday docked at 64. SAFAR, the forecasting body under the Union ministry of earth sciences, exclaimed, “The moderation in pollution was mainly due to significant rainfall and subsequent washout of particles.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/all-at-sea-sept-high-plunges-delhi-to-new-low/articleshow/85848196.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

The centralised general platform will recognise and select all the welfare scheme beneficiaries. The cabinet gave the clearance for Rs 34.32 crore for the first phase of the project that includes software, hardware and human resources. The Rebuild Kerala Initiative (RKI) will give the administrative sanction for the project. There are more than 400 government welfare schemes in the state and they follow different methods for selecting beneficiaries. This results in issues like duplication and repetition of beneficiaries due to lack of integration. The unified registry will treat a family as a basic unit while preparing the database of the beneficiaries of various schemes. There will also be a facility to add the names of beneficiaries who are not included in any scheme. Once integrated, each individual and family will be provided with an identification number. The registry will include only those details that are required for various schemes. More Plus One seats: The cabinet sanctioned 20% more Plus One seats for all subjects in Palakkad, Kozhikode, Malappuram, Wayanad, Kannur and Kasaragod. Order cancelled: The cabinet decided to cancel the order issued by the previous UDF government that renewed the lease of 78 cents of land to YMCA in Vanchiyoor village for another 30 years. The cabinet also decided to demand YMCA to clear the lease dues in one instalment. Appointment: The cabinet appointed former MP T N Seema as the coordinator of the Navakeralam program for a period of three years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cabinet-nod-for-unified-registry/articleshow/85848275.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: PWD to tackle 50 key points to plug waterlogging||NEW DELHI: The public works department (PWD) has identified 147 vulnerable points for waterlogging in the city, out of which the situation remains particularly troublesome at seven locations where measures like drain redesigning and sensors have already been adopted. In the second phase, corrective measures will be introduced at 50 critical points. “In the first phase, several short- and long-term solutions are being introduced at seven most vulnerable points. Now 50 more locations, which fall under the critical category, will be studied to identify the problems, quantum of flow and localised solutions. Phase I is expected to be completed by February and Phase II by December 2022,” a senior official said. The selected critical points have been categorised under various PWD zones. Under Shahdara circle, the selected points include GT Road near Shahdara railway bridge, Vikas Marg near Karkardooma Metro station, near Apsara border and Tahirpur Road near Swami Dayanand Hospital. The points under East circle are Laxmi Nagar Metro station and Shashi Garden, while Project circle will work on Minto Bridge, SPM Marg Chhatta rail, New Delhi railway station-Paharganj side and Anand Parbat Gali 4 and 10 points. Burari Mor, IP flyover, ISBT to Chandgi Ram Akhara, and Mall Road (Khyber Pass) will be in focus under Central and New Delhi circles. Corrective measures under West circle will be taken near Mayapuri flyover, Mundka, Rajdhani Park and Tikri Border Metro stations, and Raja garden flyover. Northwest circle has selected road opposite NDPL office, while North circle will focus on Adarsh Nagar Metro station, GTK depot and Azadpur underpass that remains perpetually waterlogged. South circle will undertake the study at several critical points, including DC office Saket, Western Marg, Sultanpur Metro station, Pusa Road roundabout, Buddha Garden, Okhla Mandi IP Park, Moolchand underpass, Savitri Cinema and Batra Hospital. The vulnerable points under Phase I include Pul Prahladpur, Minto Bridge, Zakhira underpass, Loni Road roundabout, Karala-Kanjhawala Road, WHO-Ring Road and Jahangirpuri Metro station. “In case of Minto Bridge, a 150m alternate drain has been connected with JLN Road drain to reduce the load. A new sumpwell will be set up in Pul Prahladpur and the capacity of pumps has already been doubled to 850 horsepower. Each point has a localised plan,” the official said. The civic body has spent around Rs 75 lakh on measures like sensors, CCTV cameras, new motors and an alternate drain in case of Minto Bridge, and around Rs 70 lakh will be spent on Pul Prahladpur underpass alone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ph-ii-pwd-to-tackle-50-key-points-to-plug-waterlogging/articleshow/85848229.cms||Paras Singh

Moreover, to ensure the national capital doesn’t face a shortage of beds in case of a crisis, work has started to prepare more than 30,000 additional dedicated Covid beds. Sources in Delhi government said that Niti Aayog has advised the state government to ramp up the number of beds further so that it has around 67,000 Covid beds available in case the capital faces a third wave. “Each of the 11 revenue districts in Delhi have been asked to identify around two vacant sites, where Covid care facilities can come up in case of a third wave. Each district has been asked to start working on preparing 3,000 to 4,000 additional dedicated beds,” a Delhi government official said. The proposed Covid care centres will be built along the lines of similar facilities created by Delhi government near Lok Nayak and Guru Teg Bahadur hospitals. Earlier, to augment the number of ICU and oxygen beds in Delhi, the AAP government had decided to set up centres at Ramlila ground near these two hospitals, with 500 ICU beds each. The work at these facilities was completed at a frenetic pace as there was a major crunch of ICU beds and oxygenated beds when the deadly second wave swept through Delhi. While it may not be possible to arrange oxygen through pipelines at these centres like in hospitals, which have a centralised system, provision of oxygen cylinders and concentrators will be made to provide adequate oxygen support to patients who need them. The facilities will be air-conditioned and also have adequate medical equipment required for treatment of Covid-19 patients. State health minister Satyendar Jain had said last week that based on the projections of a likely third wave, Delhi government is making all the necessary arrangements. He said that other medical facilities, including availability of sufficient oxygen and essential drugs have also been taken care of.  Delhi government has also started the process of creating “semi-permanent Covid hospitals” with nearly 7,000 ICU beds in total, which will be set up near Chacha Nehru Bal Chikitsalaya and GTB Hospital, apart from Sarita Vihar, Raghubir Nagar, Shalimar Bagh, Kirari and Sultanpuri. The biggest of these ‘temporary’ Covid hospitals will come up at GTB hospital complex, which will be a five-storey structure spread over an area of more than six acres with 1,912 ICU beds. To save time and create these facilities as soon as possible, the multi-storey hospital buildings are proposed as hollow ‘mild steel’ square or rectangular tube steel structures. The structures will have reinforced concrete cement raft or isolated foundation, which will support the entire building.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/temporary-shelters-to-pitch-in-for-covid-19-emergencies/articleshow/85850610.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The normal rainfall for the month is an average 258mm. August rains over the past decade have been over 200mm. India Meteorological Department data from 2010 for August show that the country received over 300mm rain, the highest being in 2020 and the lowest, 192.5mm, in 2009. IMD director general Mrutyunjay Mohapatra told TOI that the negative Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) was among the reasons for the below normal rain for August this year. “A negative Indian Ocean Dipole is unfavourable for the Indian monsoon as was seen in August 2005 and 2001. Monsoon depressions were absent. Only two low pressure areas built over the Bay of Bengal this August as against the normal of four. This led to below normal rain during the month,” he added. Weather activity over northwest Pacific, where the maximum number of depressions and cyclones form in August, also affected the rain in this month in India. Mohapatra said, “The frequency of such weather systems has been less over the region this year. They usually move northwestward and, upon reaching southeast Asia, their remnant circulation becomes a low pressure areas over the Bay of Bengal. About 70% of low pressure areas over the Bay of Bengal occurs in this manner during the peak monsoon months.” Most systems that formed over the northwest Pacific this August recurved northeastward towards China and Japan instead of southeast Asia, he said. “Consecutive low pressure systems over the Bay of Bengal and their required movement to sustain monsoon activity was missing during this month,” Mohapatra added. Even though August ended up with deficient rain, northwest Madhya Pradesh witnessed flooding when a low pressure system persisted over the region for some time bringing continuous heavy to very heavy rain to this region. August rainfall deficiencies are associated with El Nino or negative IOD events, as observed in nine of 15 years which recorded deficient rain (of 15% or more) since 1901. Of these, there was a large deficiency in 2005, but the seasonal rainfall from June to September was normal. In 2001, August rain was deficient by 20.1% of LPA,and the seasonal rainfall was below normal. The Met department on Wednesday said September rainfall over India is most likely to be above normal, over 110% of the170mm LPA. Above normal to normal rainfall is likely over many areas of central India, normal to below normal rainfall is most likely over many areas of northwest and northeast India and southern-most parts of peninsular India this month, the IMD forecast said. Mohapatra said considering the expected above-normal rainfall activity in September, the current deficiency of 9% in seasonal monsoon rainfall is very likely to reduce by the month-end and the June to September rain for 2021 could be around the lower end of the normal. Two dead in flash floods in ChalisgaonThe death toll in the flash floods at the Chalisgaon taluka of Jalgaon has increased to two with the police recovering another body on Wednesday. Inspector Sanjay Thenge of Chalisgaon rural police said the deceased lost his balance and slipped while trying to cross a bridge at Eklahare village. He was swept away in the flood water. “We recovered his body on Wednesday morning,” Gaikwad added. Chalisgaon MLA Mangesh Chavan, who visited Gaikwad’s village, said the body was found about 500m from the bridge near a small reservoir. On Monday, a 60-year-old woman was washed away in the flood water.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/two-weather-systems-cause-24-deficiency-in-august-rain-worst-since-2009/articleshow/85848334.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Kolkata||Strike takes us nowhere, we resolve issues mutually: IOC||Kolkata: Oil marketing companies (OMCs) are always ready to speak with dealers to resolve issues being faced by them. A IOC spokesperson on Wednesday told TOI: “A strike may take us nowhere, besides causing trouble to motorists, commuters and transporters.” The OMCs and the dealers have the age-old tradition to resolve issues mutually. The petroleum dealers in Bengal had observed no-purchase-no-sale day on Tuesday. But contrary to dealers’ claim of non-operation at 99% retail outlets in Bengal, an IOC official said that many fuel stations functioned throughout the day without a hitch. IOC itself has 22 company-owned-company-operated (COCO) fuel stations. BPC and HPC also have their own outlets. “Besides, many of our dealers kept their outlets out of the strike,” he added OMC officials said that ethanol blending is a policy of the government of India. “We can inform our higher-ups on the issues being faced by dealers and customers. As far as financial losses of dealers are concerned, they are always compensated if they incur any loss. There is a system to claim the compensation,” said the IOC spokesman. The demand for use of flow-meters while supplying fuel to dealers is something to do with the legal metrology. “We cannot decide on our own whether to use a flow-meter or not. The standard is set by the legal metrology department. If they replace dip-stick with flow-meter, all OMCs are duty-bound to follow that. But we can assure that the highest level of ethical standard is followed to negate the possibility of any transmission loss of fuel during the delivery,” said spokesperson.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/strike-takes-us-nowhere-we-resolve-issues-mutually-ioc/articleshow/85845647.cms||---
---||Delhi||Little to no action in private schools as most parents not convinced yet||New Delhi: On the day schools in Delhi reopened after a 17-month closure forced by Covid-19, not many private schools resumed classes. Parents are still uncertain about the new arrangements and with vaccination of children nowhere on the horizon, are reluctant to sign the mandated consent form. A few private schools that did open on Wednesday saw poor attendance. Parents are grappling with a host of worries, being both fearful of infection and unsure about the standard operating protocols for physical classes. Munish Tamang, father of a Class X student of Springdales, Dhaula Kuan, claimed, “We are yet to hear anything from the school. In any case, I wouldn’t want to send children to school unvaccinated. I don’t think it is safe.” At Mount Abu Public School, Rohini only 40% of Class IX parents have given their consent. Principal Jyoti Arora hoped the attendance would increase gradually. Parents are also aghast at schools asking them to ferry their kids to and from classes because there will be no school transport. “We are now working from our offices, so it will be difficult for us to do that,” pointed out Hitesh Sangwan, father of a Class IX student in a south Delhi school. “It is also unnerving for us to think that our children will have to mix around with students who will take public transport to schools.” There is apprehension among parents about their children missing out on classes if they don’t report to school. DDMA made it clear in its orders on school reopening that lessons had to be in blended mode and most institutions claimed to have equipped with recording devices and adequate broadband connections. But Sardar Patel Vidyalaya, for one, did not mention online classes in the information it sent to parents. Principal Anuradha Joshi told TOI, “We don’t have a studio for online classes, but we will do what we can.” Bal Bharti Public School, Ganga Ram Hospital Marg, resumed classes on Wednesday with students of classes X and XII coming on three days and Class X students on two. “Each of the classes is at 50% strength,” said a school official. “For those not coming, teachers are conducting online lessons alongside classroom teaching.” The Indian School has decided to reopen from September 6. At a meeting with the parents association, it was decided that classes XI and XII would commence first though all exams will be held offline, according to principal Tania Joshi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/little-to-no-action-in-private-schools-as-most-parents-not-convinced-yet/articleshow/85850578.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||One in three Delhi kids has impaired lungs: Study||NEW DELHI: Nearly one out of every three school children in Delhi has asthma and airflow obstruction. In comparison, only 23% children living in cities like Kottayam and Mysuru, where there is less pollution compared to Delhi, have respiratory health issues, a group of experts has claimed this on the basis of a study that assessed the respiratory health of schoolchildren in three cities – Delhi, Kottayam in Kerala and Mysuru in Karnataka – by using a questionnaire and lung function test. A total of 4,361 boys and girls aged between 13-14 years and 16-17 years from 12 private schools (three each in Delhi and Mysuru and six in Kottayam) were invited to participate in this study, of whom 3,456 consented and 928 students from Delhi, 1,040 from Kottayam and 1,189 from Mysuru completed the questionnaire and performed good quality spirometry (lung function test), Dr Arvind Kumar, one of the authors of the study that has been published in the journal Lung India, said. He added that lung function tests revealed 29% children living in Delhi suffered from asthma and airflow obstruction compared to 23% prevalence of the respiratory symptoms seen in children living in Kottayam and Mysuru. Also, Dr Kumar added that out of the 29% children who were found to have airflow obstruction/asthma on spirometry in Delhi, only 12% reported ever being diagnosed with asthma and 3% were using some form of inhalers. In Kottayam and Mysuru, among the 23% (approx) children who were found to have airflow obstruction/asthma on spirometry, 27% reported ever being diagnosed with asthma and 8% were using some inhalers, the noted chest surgeon said. The prevalence of overweight and obesity in children from Delhi was 40% compared with approximately 16% among children from Kottayam and Mysuru. Dr Kumar, who is chairman of the Institute of Chest Surgery at Medanta Gurgaon, said the presence of obesity and overweight was strongly associated with asthma. “This study is an eye-opener. It has shown an unacceptably high prevalence of respiratory and allergic symptoms, spirometry-defined asthma, and obesity in Delhi children. Air pollution is the probable link with all three. It is high time that the air pollution issue in Delhi and other cities is settled in a systematic manner to save the future of our children,” he added. Among the sample population, boys were observed to have a two-fold higher prevalence of asthma than girls. This observation was common in all the three sites, the study said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/1-in-3-city-kids-has-impaired-lungs-study/articleshow/85848281.cms||---
---||India||Rajasthan para medallists get first pay after months||JAIPUR: As it rushed to bask in the medal glow of the three Paralympic stars on its rolls, Rajasthan's forest department woke up to the sobering realisation that it hadn't paid them a single month's salary yet. Gold medal-winning shooter Avani Lakhera, javelin silver medallist Devendra Jhajharia and bronze winner Sunder Singh Gurjar were recruited as officers of the rank of assistant conservators of forest between five and 10 months ago, but their salaries remained pending until the trio shot into the limelight. Late Wednesday, an official said the dues of seven sportspersons, including the medal winners, had been cleared. The scurry to clear the pay backlog came after the families of at least two of the Paralympic medallists said the forest department had not paid them a single rupee since they were hired. While Lakhera was appointed on April 16, Jhajharia and Gurjar joined the forest department on November 5 and December 1, 2020, respectively. The forest department claimed that the salary disbursement was delayed by "incomplete documentation" as the trio had been practising outside the state in the run-up to the Tokyo Games. "An employee must be phsyically present to create a permanent retirement account number and link it to Aadhaar. Since they were not in Rajasthan, this couldn't be done. Also, the players formally joined service at the state secretariat instead of Aranya Bhawan (the forest department headquarters)," a senior official said. Deep Narayan Pandey, who was recently appointed head of forest forces, said the rules had to be eased to pave the way for the process of salary disbursement after the issue was highlighted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rajasthan-para-medallists-get-first-pay-after-months/articleshow/85853665.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Maharashtra: Minor says sold thrice by father in 3 years; 8 booked in Nanded||AURANGABAD: The Hadgaon police in Nanded have booked eight people after a 17-year-old lodged a complaint that she was sold thrice by her father to different men over the past two years. The father, a casual worker, is among those booked. Besides the father, police have booked the girl’s stepmother, the three men she was sold to, a woman pimp in Rajasthan and two others. They have been booked under various charges including rape, selling person as slave, selling or hiring a minor for prostitution, forgery and for causing miscarriage of a woman without her consent. Police have also slapped sections of the Protection for Children from Sexual Offences Act on the eight suspects. Nanded additional superintendent of police Vijay Kabade told TOI, “The minor was recently rescued by her aunt — her biological mother’s sister — and other relatives from a Satara-based man. The girl had managed to contact her aunt over the phone. Prima facie, it appears that the father would sell her to make money.” Kabade said the girl was first sold to a man in Kota, Rajasthan. This deal was effected in Aurangabad when the girl’s father had come there in search of work. Hence, a zero FIR has been registered in the case which has been forwarded to the Aurangabad city police. When contacted, MIDC Waluj’s senior inspector Sandeep Gurme confirmed having received the FIR. He said the survivor’s statement has been recorded before the court, her medical examination done and a search launched for her father, stepmother and the others. In her complaint, the girl said that when she was in the eighth standard about a couple of years ago, she was sold to the Kota-based man through a woman pimp. She was in Kota for a month, during which time she was given drinks laced with sedatives and repeatedly raped. After she fell ill, she was brought back to Hadgaon. She said that her father then sold her to a 45-year-old man from Nandurbar for Rs 2 lakh, payable in instalments. This man raped her for eight months, she alleged. Her father brought her back after the man failed to pay the last instalment of the promised money. She said that sometime later, she was sold to a 40-year-old man from Satara, where she was raped for months. She was rescued from here after she contacted her aunt.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/minor-sold-thrice-by-dad-in-two-years-8-booked/articleshow/85843206.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Mumbai||Gang’s plans to murder bookie caught on tape in Mumbai||MUMBAI: Is the Pandav Putra gang trying to raise its head in the absence of any major gangs in the city? The crime branch arrested six members of the Pandav Putra gang last week and stumbled upon a tapped conversation where the accused are heard discussing a plot to murder a cricket bookie. Sources said that in the 10-minute recorded conversation, gang leader Deepak Walekar is heard saying that if they kill one bookie, over 100 bookies will automatically line up and pay them protection money. Sources said that the idea of killing a particular bookie who was arrested recently by the police came to them after an audio clip of two bookies fighting and abusing each other went viral a few months ago. In the audio clip, one bookie is abusing the other for a large payment default and threatening to kidnap his minor daughter and sexually assault her. “We normally take one crore for a murder but we will kill the bookie free of cost and once this is done more than 100 bookies will give us protection money,” Walekar says in the audio conversation. An official said that the crime branch wanted to interrogate the accused to know which bookie they wanted to kill and what was their plan. Sources in the crime branch said with most of the major gangs, like the Dawood Ibrahim, Chhota Rajan, Ravi Pujari and Ejaz Lakhdawala gangs, defunct, the Pandav Putra gang may be trying to use this opportunity to raise its head. The anti-extortion cell of the crime branch last week arrested six members of Pandav Putra gang, namely, Deepak Walekar, Ganesh Suryavanshi, Siddhart Mayekar, Anil Bhuvad, Sanjay Bhange and Jitendra Vaishnavikar. The gang members were calling a civil contractor from south Mumbai and threatening him to kill him if he did not give them 30 per cent of his profit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-gangs-plans-to-murder-bookie-caught-on-tape/articleshow/85850637.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Nagpur||FOLLOW CURBS TODAY, CELEBRATE TOMORROW||People are looking forward to festive times to shed the negativity around Covid-19 but the government and authorities have rung alarm bells and imposed restrictions fearing a spike in cases. After discussing the rules, TOI Debate panellists stress the importance of Covid-appropriate behaviour and avoiding super-spreader eventsDespite Covid-19 cases declining considerably after the peak of second wave in April, the state government wants festive celebrations to be muted due to projections for the third wave. Though not completely opposing the government stand, entrepreneur Ravindra Agrawal asked how is the business community going to survive in such scenario?Like it supports its own machinery and offices that are kept open even during the lockdown, Agrawal said, what are the plans for businesses? “Shopkeepers are following the SOPs,” he said.Dr Nitin Shinde, infectious disease specialist at Alexis Hospital, said that scientific data should be followed. “The test positivity rate has been very low for the last three months. Also, it is now proven that partial or full lockdowns have not helped in controlling the disease,” he said while citing the example of Kerala and countries that had strict restrictions but still witnessed spike in cases.Stressing it is very difficult to contain the virus, Dr Shinde said it’s time to change strategy. About third wave, he said it might happen only if there is significant multiplication of the virus in the community. “There is now new variant now and Delta is still the dominant one. The virus is likely to take a hiatus of 4-5 months before a new variant emerges,” he said.Dr Shinde emphasized that economic activities need to continue but ban super spreader events, especially indoor gatherings that are very dangerous. “The most effective intervention right now could be asymptomatic random testing and increasing the vaccine coverage,” he said.Agreeing with Dr Shinde, corporator and former NMC standing committee chairman Virendra Kukreja said that the government is dragging on with the unlock process. He said that focus should be on ensuring implementation of Covid-appropriate behaviour. “The civic administration should strictly enforce the rules, but life needs to move on,” he said.Considering the opposition to the ban on Dahi Hand celebrations, should the government have allowed it with some restrictions? “Let us look at the facts,” said municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B who pointed out that almost 90% restrictions on economic and social activities have been removed. “But public gatherings that could prove super-spreader events should not be allowed,” he said.Concurring with the decision on Dahi Handi, entrepreneur Manisha Bawankar said that public festivities do attract crowds and “then social distancing goes for a toss”. To explain how rules can be followed, Bawankar gave the example of Makar Sankranti celebrations by the VIA Lady Entrepreneurship Wing where members were called in batches of 10 to maintain physical distancing.Major festivals are lined up till December end. People do look forward to catching up with friends and relatives on such occasions. “Yes, celebrations are good for the mental well-being but given the current situation they should be held in small batches,” said district programme officer for mental health (Nagpur) Dr Akshay Sarode.He pointed out that one can celebrate in a qualitative manner even with 10 people. “And if the same thing is done with 1,000 strangers, there is a high chance of violation of Covid norms because in such a large gathering a false sense of safety can creep in,” he said.Businessman Nitesh Agrawal too is in favour of celebrating festivals with limited capacity. “Public awareness is important,” he said while stressing that lockdown doesn’t only mean keeping shops closed, but “it’s important to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour”.On objections being raised over political gatherings that tend to cause crowding, Kukreja said public representatives always think about the welfare of citizens. “Restrictions should apply to all. Yet, restrictions are not the solution. We are achieving herd immunity and vaccination has gathered pace,” he said.Radhakrishnan emphasized that the administration is taking steps like mandatory institutional isolation and genome sequencing based on scientific data and past experiences. “The need of the hour is proactive testing, vaccination, isolating positive patients and keeping a watch on the new variants,” he said.He made it clear that Covid is very much here. “If we don’t celebrate festivals in a grand manner this year, then we may have a better 2022,” he said.Dr Shinde said that there cannot be zero Covid cases but it’s also true that there have never been such low number of cases since the pandemic hit the city. “Replacing Delta is going to be very difficult for any new variant and even the C.1.2 variant which was first detected in South Africa is not pre-dominant,” he said.He begged to differ on the institutional isolation norm. “The viral load in the nose in case of new variants is one lakh times higher than the old virus. So, by the time a person tests positive and is isolated, s/he may have already infected 20 others. And from fifth day, the infectivity dramatically dips. Isolation will not work in such cases,” said Dr Shinde.To prevent a spike in cases, Nitesh Agrawal suggested ban on travel, especially during the festive season. According to Agrawal, many people travelled to Mathura from Nagpur to celebrate Janmashtami. He also suggested closing shops by 6pm to control crowding.Radhakrishnan sounded confident that restrictions will work. “People are largely cooperating. Yes, it gets difficult when restrictions are unreasonable” he said.While agreeing with him, Ravindra Agrawal urged the civic chief to check crowding on roads due to hawkers in market places like Sitabuldi.Dr Shinde supported travel ban and suggested targeting super spreader events “which were responsible for the second wave”. Kukreja and Bawankar stressed public awareness to check super spreader events.. For Dr Sarode, some sort of restrictions are still needed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/follow-curbs-today-celebrate-tomorrow/articleshow/85845759.cms||---

Of the 11 major irrigation projects, Jayakwadi in Aurangabad district, is still showing relatively lower storage. Earlier, a day after 67 revenue circles from Marathwada reported heavy rainfall of over 65 mm, five circles from Jalna and two circles from Aurangabad district witnessed such incessant showers during past 24-hours ending on Wednesday morning. The region comprising eight districts recorded average 9 mm showers with many parts of Aurangabad also registered occasional spells of light to medium showers till Wednesday evening. With 648 mm showers since June 1, Marathwada has now received 95% of season’s rainfall receiving during the four months of the rainy season. The India Meteorological Department has predicted chances of only occasional spells of light rain over Aurangabad and other parts of the region during next 48-hours. Jayakwaadi major irrigation project, which has received 503 mm showers in its catchment areas since June 1, was showing 43% live storage by Wednesday morning. Assistant superintendent engineer with Command Area Development Authority (CADA) of Godavari Irrigation Development Corporation (GMIDC), Jaising Hire said Jayakwadi project has not received any major inflows from upstream dams located in Nashik and Ahmednagar districts. “With one month of rainy season still to go coupled with the possibility of rainfall during the withdrawal phase, of Monsoon, we expect revival of Jayakwadi dam and other irrigation projects from the region,” he said. In Aurangabad region, different reservoirs hold 110 TMC water as compared to 169 TMC storage during corresponding period last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/3-major-dams-in-marathwada-discharge-water/articleshow/85843264.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||‘Miffed group leaders unhappy with Tariq Anwar’||Thiruvananthapuram: An uneasy calm prevailed in the Congress group camps on Wednesday as the party high command refused to budge an inch from its efforts to delink the party state unit from the clutches of the established groups and miffed group leaders continued to lament in private over the denial of ‘equal’ justice. Following strict instructions from the party high command against leaders airing open criticism on DCC reorganization, the group leaders and their lieutenants abstained from passing bitter comments openly. However, ‘A’ and ‘I’ groups continued the intra-group communications and shared the opinion that the high command representative Tariq Anwar failed to act impartially as he allegedly sided with the new power centre that has emerged under the leadership of KPCC president K Sudhakaran, opposition leader VD Satheesan and AICC general secretary KC Venugopal. According to leaders of both ‘A’ and ‘I’ groups, disciplinary action was taken by the party leadership against only select persons. While action was taken against those who openly criticized Sudhakaran and Satheesan, no action was taken against those who openly rubbished Oommen Chandy and Chennithala, they complained. Former opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala –who refused to make a direct comment on questions regarding the simmering resentment over DCC reorganization –told reporters on Wednesday that he had already shared his thoughts with the Congress high command and hence would prefer not to make any more public comment on the issue. But, Chennithala, while answering to a question, said organizational election would be the best way to settle the issues plaguing the party. “Organizational election is the best way. It’s not mandatory that organizational election should be conducted only as part of an exercise at the national level. It did happen otherwise in the past as well,” he said. Meanwhile, UDF coordination committee is scheduled to meet at Cantonment house, the official residence of the opposition leader on Monday. The bilateral discussion with RSP leaders – who raised apprehensions over the way UDF functioned – would be held at 11:30am that day, said UDF convenor MM Hassan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/miffed-group-leaders-unhappy-with-tariq-anwar/articleshow/85848418.cms||---
---||Delhi||HC voices infection fears as Afghans line up at UNHCR office||New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Wednesday expressed concern over a large gathering of Afghans protesting outside the UN High Commissioner for Refugees office in south Delhi, noting that it could act as a superspreader for Covid-19. “Look at the pictures, what is this? No one is wearing any mask, this could be a superspreader for Covid 19... You should ensure some protocol is there. You are challaning people daily for not wearing masks in cars,” the court remarked, asking the Centre, Delhi government and police to resolve the issue. Justice Rekha Palli underlined that the situation couldn’t be permitted to continue while hearing a petition by Vasant Vihar Welfare Association, which stated that the refugees/asylum-seekers had gathered at B Block since August 15, including lanes and parks adjoining it, and residents had been facing difficulties even in going to buy essentials. Notices have been issued to the home and external affairs ministries, Delhi government, Delhi Police, South Delhi Municipal Corporation and Delhi Jal Board, pointing out that it is not just the “inconvenience to public” that bothered the court but the possibility of the gathering acting “as a superspreader of Covid again”. It asked the AAP government to inform what has been done following the Supreme Court’s direction to frame guidelines on the issue of the right to protest to ensure a balance between fundamental rights and maintenance of law and order. The petition said the number of such people from Afghanistan had increased manifold in the past week and the manner in which the protesters were sitting next to each other was likely to be a superspreader. It has sought to remove the protesters. The counsel for the Centre said it was not a normal situation and the residents should have a humanitarian approach as this involved international issues that couldn’t be decided overnight.

The woman set herself ablaze along with a man who accompanied her and both later died. Issuing the notices, NHRC said it was “shocking” that the woman felt “victimised by the system”. “The National Human Rights Commission has taken cognisance of a complaint that a woman, victim of alleged sexual assault and police apathy, set herself on fire along with a man outside the Supreme Court on August 16, 2021. Subsequently both died while undergoing treatment at RML Hospital,” the commission said in a statement. The commission issued notices to Director General of Police, Uttar Pradesh and the Delhi Police commissioner, asking them to submit a detailed report in four weeks along with the action initiated against the errant public servants. The Uttar Pradesh DGP was also directed to “ensure safety and security of the family members of the victims”. Before immolating themselves, the victims purportedly recorded a live video on Facebook, in which the woman said she had lodged a rape case against an MP from Uttar Pradesh in June 2019, but the “accused police officials were supporting the offender”. “Allegedly, instead of taking action against the accused MP, police registered a false case against her and got a non-bailable warrant issued against her,” NHRC letter to the police chiefs said. After the woman and man attempted self-immolation, police registered a case under Section 309 (attempt to commit suicide) of IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/self-immolation-case-nhrc-issues-notices/articleshow/85850646.cms||---

The state transport utility continues to witness a loss of around Rs 400 crore per month during the current pandemic due to drop in passenger count, posing unprecedented financial crisis before the MSRTC. Many MSRTC employees said they were facing trouble due to non-release of monthly salary. “I borrowed money from my brother-in-law to manage house expenses. We can understand financial crisis arising out of Covid-19 outbreak, but a delay of two months delay in crediting salary is too much,” a conductor from Parbhani district said. When contacted, MSRTC spokesperson said the state government has promised Rs 500 crore towards the release of salaries. “The official notification to facilitate the transfer of money is yet to be issued. Once the notification is out, the salaries are expected to get disbursed in next four days. It is expected that salaries for July and August will be disbursed together,” he said. Notably, the salaries of MSRTC staff from January to June could was paid only with the help of the government as the state transportation has incurred over Rs 7,000 crore losses since March 2020. Union leader Shrirang Barge of ST Karmachari Congress said the BEST owes Rs 71 crore to the MSRTC towards Covid-related services. “Even if the government offers financial aid of Rs 500 crore, the state transportation will be short of around Rs 80 crore to release monthly dues of the staff for two months. The government should ask the BEST for release of necessary money at the earliest,” he said. Maharashtra Transport Minister Anil Parab could not be reached for his comments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/over-93k-msrtc-staffersyet-to-get-july-salaries/articleshow/85843353.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Delhi||N corpn to allow NGOs, trusts to use vacant clinic and dispensary sites||New Delhi: North Delhi Municipal Corporation’s standing committee on Wednesday passed a policy to allow vacant sites of dispensaries and clinics of health department to be used to run healthcare facility by NGOs, charitable trusts, and philanthropic organisation, which will also be allowed to take a nominal charge. The committee also approved setting up of such NGO-run healthcare facilities in Qutubgarh dispensary complex under Narela zone and Jhandewalan chest clinic premises in Karol Bagh zone. Leader of the House Chhail Bihari Goswami said municipal commissioner would frame criterion in terms of financial background, working and other factors for organisation to be deemed fit for such allotment. “We will also allow NGO to use these premises to set up blood and drug banks,” he added. AAP member in the committee, however, objected to the move and argued that the provision to allow a nominal charge by the NGOs should either be fixed/defined or completely removed. A senior corporation official said the health department had decided to construct a new building in place of old Qutubgarh dispensary, which was constructed but remained unutilised. “Similarly, in the complex of Jhandewalan chest clinic, some portions of the building remain unutilised. The health department has more such underutilised properties where it is facing constraints,” the official added.

---||Delhi||Needless row is being created over counter-terrorism course: JNU VC||New Delhi: The vice-chancellor of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), M Jagadesh Kumar, issued a statement on Wednesday and said “needless controversy was being created about a course without going into academic merits of the course”. The statement from Kumar comes a day after Rajya Sabha MP Binoy Viswam wrote to the Union education minister against the course “Counter-Terrorism, Asymmetric Conflicts and Strategies for Cooperation among Major Powers” being started for engineering students. Issuing a statement, Kumar, said, “The objective of the course is mainly to have an in-depth understanding of the challenges emanating from terrorism to India’s national security and how India can get equipped with an adequate response in the case of any eventuality. The way things have unfolded in India’s neighborhood is proving highly detrimental to India’s national security. It is imperative that an academic institution like JNU takes the lead and builds a good set of counter-terrorism specialists. India urgently needs a critical mass of such specialists in this field.” He added, “The curriculum has been designed keeping in mind the terrorist activities at the global level and India’s experience in handling them. There is a need to further evolve India’s perspective in a balanced and objective manner. This course has the potential to build a strong narrative for India. An in-depth understanding of various global and regional terrorist networks as a part of the curriculum of this course is needed.” He stated that he will continue to encourage critical thinking in JNU since the university is a place of “free inquiry where divergent ideas are encouraged to thrive”. “How India has witnessed the rise of religious fundamentalism and radicalisation through perverse ideologies in its neighbourhood is an area where a lot of knowledge is needed to deal with emerging situations. The curriculum is holistic and also contains sections on the role of intelligence information and counter-terrorism cooperation among major powers,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/needless-row-is-being-created-over-counter-terrorism-course-jnu-vc/articleshow/85850671.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

On the first day, very few coaching centres had 50% occupancy while the rest were hoping for students to fill the classes in the coming weeks. Classes that used to run for six hours a batch will now be limited to four hours due to the 50% cap on students till the situation gets normal, said a coaching centre operator, citing strict compliance of Covid-19 protocol. This is a challenge for teachers too who have to complete courses in three months instead of 10 months earlier. Coaching institutes said that they were expecting a peak of about 1.5 lakh students in two months if the third wave does not hit the country. The reopening also saw restrictions on time spent by students in coaching institutes beyond classes. Generally, students would stay back after regular classes for problem-solving classes which most of the institutes have not started yet to limit the number of students. “Strict guidelines of the local administration do not allow us to operate fully. The problem-solving sessions/desk which runs for the whole day provides students with instant solutions to their problems/difficulty to understand any concept. This will take some time to resume,” said Suraj Jain, a senior faculty at one of the coaching majors. The problem-solving desk is always surrounded by students and one can stay on for as long as they want. The dress code has a new addition, a face mask, which is mandatory for every student, who has to always carry an extra one along with a hand sanitiser and water bottle. Rules are in place at water dispensers and urinals as only one-third capacity is allowed at one time. Students will not be able to have their canteen or dhaba sessions after classes or even eat in groups as they are strictly not allowed to maintain social distance. Restrictions like only one student in a hostel/rented room and not more than three in an autorickshaw have made basic facilities expensive. The public transport system in coaching areas does not have the frequency and students have to opt for private transport. The main coaching hubs of Vigyan Nagar, Indira Vihar and Kunhari does not have city buses at the moment. “Earlier, I used to pay Rs 10 for a trip, but since I came back last week, I have to pay Rs 20 for the same trip,” said Rahul Sharma, a student from Udaipur. Coaching centres are also being strictly monitored by the local administration.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/on-reopening-day-kota-students-get-a-feel-of-new-normal/articleshow/85850693.cms||---

The price of a 14.2kg domestic cylinder was increased by Rs 25 on Wednesday, taking the retail price to Rs 884.50 here. It will severely hit low income consumers in Mumbai and have deprived of a subsidy for over a year. Had there been subsidy, they would have saved nearly Rs500 a month, sources said. It includes maids, cooks and drivers. On Wednesday, there was a fluctuation in rates of other fuel too. Petrol in Mumbai dropped marginally to Rs 107.39, while diesel fell to Rs 96.33 a litre.

---||Jodhpur||Sandstorms from Rajasthan may reach Delhi-NCR: Study||JAIPUR: The state’s desert region, spread across the four districts of Jaisalmer, Barmer, Jodhpur and Bikaner, is fast expanding due to the migration of people, unscientific plantation drives, change in rainfall pattern and rise in sandstorms. As per a report, prepared by the Central University of Rajasthan (CURAJ) under the United Nations Convention to Combating Desertification, the last decade (2008-2018) has caused more damage to the desert ecosystem than the last 50 years. The report has warned that, in the coming years, sandstorms are going to be more intense and will travel as far as the National Capital Region (NCR), beyond its usual destinations in central Rajasthan. The desert area in the arid region or the core districts constitutes about 75% of the total Thar desert while the remaining 25% is spread across other districts. The report was published in the 'Journal of Arid Environments' by Laxmi Kant Sharma, Alok Raj and Kritika Somawat of the department of environment science, CURAJ. “The suspended particles from the arid region are already travelling as far as Delhi contributing to its air pollution. This is happening due to the rise in sand and wind storms in the arid region of Rajasthan in the last decade. With the continuous rise in desertification and degradation of Aravalli hills, which is the natural wall, the day is not far off when sandstorms in these desert districts will be seen in Delhi too,” said Sharma, who is also a member of the United Nations International Union of Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. The report says that 4.98% of the area in the four districts has turned into complete desert while 21% of the total area has become ‘critical’. The 10% rise in vegetation cover in the region may look significant, but it is due to the massive plantation drive in and around the Aravalli range in Jodhpur. In the other three districts, the situation has not changed. Even the critical area will act as a fuel and turn a minor storm into a major one and accelerate its speed and distance. The department is now planning to document the number of storms on the basis of data from the US remote sensing agency, LANDSAT. According to Sharma, this is the first time a detailed integrated report on desertification has been prepared by evaluating socio-economic indicators, climate and vegetation of the region to understand the desertification process. “The Census data from 1971 to 2011 has thrown up some major surprises like the growth rate in the region, which was at an all-time high from 1971-1991 but started falling thereafter. During the same period, the change in the rainfall pattern and hotter days led to weathering of further sand particles. The situation has sparked a migration that has become more intense after 2011 leading to the abandoning of cultivated land and turning it into barren land. It is a perfect recipe for desertification,” said Alok Raj, a research scholar who contributed to the paper.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/sandstorms-from-raj-may-reach-ncr-study/articleshow/85854850.cms||Shoeb Khan

The woman was reportedly in her 20s. The commission said it learnt through media reports that the woman was a civil defence volunteer and was deployed in the office of district magistrate in southeast district. “The woman was missing since August 27 and her dead body was found from Surajkund in Faridabad on August 30, in a mutilated condition. DCW has spoken with the family of the victim and they have alleged gang rape with her,” said a notice sent by DCW to Faridabad police. The commission has initiated an inquiry into the matter after taking suo-motu cognizance of media reports of murder of the woman. It has asked police to provide a copy of the FIR, details of the accused arrested, copy of the postmortem report and detailed action taken report in the matter. As the family has claimed gang-rape, DCW has asked police whether sections of sexual assaults have been added and to give reasons if such sections have not been included in the FIR. Faridabad police have been asked to share information by September 6. Swati Maliwal, chairperson of DCW, said, “There should be a fast and fair investigation and the accused need to be punished strictly if found guilty.” TNN||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/murder-and-gang-rape-of-woman-in-faridabad-dcw-notice-to-police/articleshow/85850718.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

AAIB, which was to submit the report in Jan, had been granted multiple extensions and in the latest announcement, the Union minister for civil aviation had said in a reply to a question in Parliament that the report is likely to be completed by August. However, it has not been made public yet. The probe report was delayed due to the ongoing pandemic especially as the US-based National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is assisting the probe as accredited representative and technical adviser. According to the ministry, the draft report is under consultation with the accredited representative of NTSB in accordance with Rule 14 of Aircraft (Investigation of Accidents and Incidents) Rules, 2017. The minister had in his reply said that the consultation process was severely hampered due to the unprecedented impact of Covid-19 but had said that the final report is likely to be made public in August 2021. The submission of the report is crucial for the airport as the resumption of wide-bodied aircraft is subject to the outcome of the probe report. The operation of wide-bodied aircraft was suspended by DGCA following the AIE crash. Previously, DGCA had banned operation of wide-bodied aircraft in May 2015 following runway safety concerns but the civil aviation regulator had allowed resumption of operation of wide-bodied aircraft in August 2018 following the mitigation works conducted by Airports Authority of India and airlines submitting a safety and compatibility report. Meanwhile, the online meeting attended by four state ministers on Wednesday to discuss the land acquisition for airport development decided to hold another meeting in Karipur on September 12. While the land acquisition for runway expansion was held up for long, the Union ministry has submitted a new proposal to the government to acquire 152 acres focusing on setting up a new terminal building, apron and car parking facilities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/probe-agency-again-misses-deadline-for-report-release/articleshow/85848520.cms||---

The court was hearing the petition filed by R Vijayakumar. The petitioner’s father who was working as a wireman in Tangedco died during service in 2006. Since the petitioner was a minor at the time of his father’s death, he had submitted an application seeking compassionate appointment after completing his diploma in electrical and electronics engineering in 2017. The authorities had rejected his application on the ground that he had not made the application within the prescribed period of three years. Challenging the rejection order, the petitioner moved the HC Madurai bench in 2018 seeking to provide employment to him on compassionate grounds. Justice D Krishnakumar observed that the Supreme Court and this court in various pronouncements have held that the applications for compassionate appointment submitted beyond the period of three years cannot be entertained. The judge further observed that the GO dated January 23, 2020, clearly prescribes the time limit to submit an application for compassionate appointment as three years from the date of death of the government servants. In view of the above settled legal position, the claim of the petitioner made beyond the prescribed period of three years cannot be entertained and it deserves to be rejected, said the judge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-dismisses-mans-plea-after-11-yrs-for-compassionate-job-appointment/articleshow/85848483.cms||---

He said BJP would strongly oppose the blanket ban on the festival that is only a week away. Annamalai was interacting with reporters at the Tuticorin airport before taking part in party events in Tuticorin and Tenkasi. “The government has issued an order permitting individuals to celebrate Vinayaka Chaturthi by installing idols. An individual needs no permission from the government to celebrate the festival. The government could have issued some restrictions by fixing a cap on the number of people who could take part in the public celebrations such as 100 or 200 and fixing the responsibility on the organisers for compliance,” he said. Annamalai said that the BJP too backed the state government in reopening schools from Monday as the number of Covid-19 cases in Tamil Nadu is drastically on the decline. He said that it is not appropriate on the part of the state government to find examples from other states such as Karnataka to issue the ban on the festival as the scenario varies from one state to another. He said that the Maharashtra government had permitted the celebration by issuing standard operating procedures (SOPs) to curtail spread of the pandemic. Tamil Nadu should follow this example, he said, and hoped that the state government would resort to a similar model.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/cant-ban-installation-of-ganesh-idols-allow-liquor-shops-bjp-chief/articleshow/85848509.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Bombay HC relief for Ghatkopar housing society residents homeless since 2017||MUMBAI: In a relief for a Ghatkopar (E) housing society’s residents, who are out of their homes since 2017, Bombay high court struck down a state government condition that required it to have 90% members from backward categories after redevelopment. A bench of Justices Shahrukh Kathawalla and Milind Jadhav on August 25 quashed and set aside the social justice & social awareness department’s February 21 decision. It clarified that “in course of redevelopment, the society by itself, or through its developer, shall be entitled to deal with the premises in sale component in ratio of 80% in open/non-backward category and 20% to backward community.” The verdict was given on a petition by three out of 36 members of Sangam CHS and Nakoda Infrastructures. In December 1966, the society was allotted over 15,500 sq ft under PWR 219 scheme for backward classes. The building was ready in 1980. After a development agreement with Nakoda in July 2017, the dilapidated building was razed. Following two rounds of litigation, the department sanctioned redevelopment on a condition of 90:10 ratio 90% members must be from backward category and 10% from open. The petition said such restrictions would affect free sale component, render redevelopment unviable and leave members homeless. The petitioners’ advocates, Karl Tamboly and Abhishek Deshmukh, said they must be given same relief as Dinanath CHS, which the state gave permission (following a December 2016 HC order) on the condition that 80% members in free sale component can be from open category and 20% from backward category. State’s advocate Abhay Patki said societies under the scheme have to maintain 90:10 ratio even when additional tenements are made available upon redevelopment. The judges said even HC in December 2016 found nothing in PWR 219 scheme or resolutions that after redevelopment, such societies have to maintain a particular ratio of backward class members to non-backward class members. “The court found that during redevelopment, 20% of the additional premises, which become available due to consumption of TDR, have to be disposed of to persons of backward category, and 80% can be disposed of in open category,” they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-relief-for-ghatkopar-hsg-society-residents-homeless-since-2017/articleshow/85848605.cms||Rosy Sequeira

It was then that he was selected for flying the first set of Rafale fighter jets from France to India. After a year’s training in France, Vikram flew one of the first Rafale aircraft which touched down at Ambala in Haryana. Since then, the 37-year-old was keen to go on a holiday in his native Ettumanoor near here. He was accorded a reception by the Public Library in Kottayam on Wednesday. Former Supreme Court Justice K T Thomas, who presided at the function, presented Vikram with a memento. In a thanksgiving reply to the Kottayam public, Vikram said that he is very much attached to Kottayam as his family roots are here and his school education was done here. Many of my relatives live in and around Ettumanoor, he said. He also thanked the organizers for taking the effort to give him a reception. “It’s a good gesture that they are respecting and recognising a military officer. In the military, Keralites have a good reputation, he said. He also said that such endeavours will be there in future too. Currently, he is posted at Hasimara Air Force station in West Bengal which has been developed as a second Rafale base. Before that he was posted in Ambala. Vikram was at his native for a short period in October last year for his brother’s marriage but had to remain confined to the house due to lockdown. He studied at Kendriya Vidyalaya in Puthuppally till Plus Two and then joined the National Defence Academy. After passing out from NDA, he joined Air Force Academy in 2004 and was commissioned as an officer in 2005.

They had taken a break at a base in the UAE. “It was challenging to fly down this long distance. But we had the support of planes from the French air force, he said. “It was a great experience to get selected for this and being sent to France for training,” he said. Though joint exercises and training have happened earlier, it is very rare that we get trained fully by a foreign country in that country, he added. Vikram, his wife Divya, who is a veterinary doctor, and two sons are living at Hasimara.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/rafale-pilot-gets-a-rousing-reception/articleshow/85848640.cms||Jaikrishnan Nair

In terms of maximum applications received by DU, Kerala is now among the top six states. The maximum number of applications came from Delhi (1,15,928 students), followed by Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Bihar and Rajasthan. Last year, Kerala was behind Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand in the list. Like every year, students who passed out from the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) remained the largest cohort of students applying to the university. Earlier, students who cleared the Indian School Certificate (ISC) board exams used to be next in the list. While only 9,659 ISC students have applied for admission to DU this year, a greater number of students (9,918) from Haryana Board have registered. This year, overall 2,87,227 students have applied for admission to the 63 colleges of the university. DU has around 70,000 seats for various courses.

Inspector Sanjay Thenge of Chalisgaon rural police said the deceased, Ramesh Gaikwad, lost his balance and slipped while trying to cross a bridge at Eklahare village. He was swept away in the flood water. “He had gone to a local maket. He, however, did not return at night. We recovered his body on Wednesday morning,” Gaikwad added. The flash flood has left a trail of destruction in the taluka. Chalisgaon MLA Mangesh Chavan, who visited Gaikwad’s village this morning, said the body was found about 500m from the bridge near a small reservoir. On Monday, a 60-year-old woman was washed away in the flood water.

---||Madurai||OPS’s wife Vijayalakshmi passes away due to heart attack||Chennai/Theni: P Vijayalakshmi, wife of AIADMK coordinator and former chief minister O Panneerselvam and mother of Theni MP O P Raveendranath Kumar, died at a hospital in Chennai on Wednesday morning. The 66-year-old suffered a cardiac arrest at the hospital ward and could not be revived, doctors said. She had been undergoing treatment at GEM Hospital for cardiac diseases. “She was stable. She returned to her bed after relieving herself in the morning when she had an arrest,” said a senior doctor treating her. The mortal remains of Vijayalakshmi were brought to OPS’s house in Periyakulam in Theni district by road. The final rites will be performed on Thursday morning. Chief minister M K Stalin, ministers and DMK leaders were among those to visit the hospital and offer condolences. Expelled AIADMK leader V K Sasikala caused a flutter when she arrived at the hospital to offer condolences, leaving behind their political rivalry that began in early 2017 when she wanted to become the CM by replacing him. It had resulted in OPS launching the ‘dharmayutham’ against her. OPS’s daughter K Kavitha Banu received her and accompanied her to meet her father. Sasikala held Panneerselvam’s hands as he sobbed inconsolably. Sasikala spent nearly half an hour at the hospital in the presence of former AIADMK ministers and MLAs. Governor Banwarilal Purohit, opposition leader and former CM Edappadi K Palaniswami, TNCC president K S Alagiri, PMK president S Ramadoss, MDMK general secretary Vaiko and Tamil Maanila Congress (M) president G K Vasan were among others who condoled the death of Vijayalakshmi. A BA graduate, she was among the four daughters and a son of Alagupandi Thevan and Valliammal, a farmer couple. A soft-spoken woman who married OPS on November 14, 1977 when he was AIADMK’s Periyakulam town secretary, she played the role of a supportive wife. Sources close to the family recalled that Vijayalakshmi was instrumental in maintaining a closely knit joint family of OPS, comprising his three younger brothers and as many sisters. She took up the responsibility of the joint family which helped Panneerselvam scale the party ranks and become CM, deputy CM, finance minister and take up various other responsibilities. Vijayalakshmi preferred to prepare the favourite dishes of her husband herself and he enjoyed being served by her. The couple has two sons and a daughter, P Raveendranath Kumar, V P Jayapradeep and K Kavitha Banu. AIADMK cadres swarmed Panneerselvam’s house along with his relatives to arrange the final rites of Vijayalakshmi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/opss-wife-vijayalakshmi-passes-away-due-to-heart-attack/articleshow/85848646.cms||---

Komal died hours later on Tuesday morning. Her father, Ram Kumar, a labourer, claimed that no doctor returned to check on her after the CM’s visit at Firozabad medical college Monday afternoon. “My daughter died due to lack of proper treatment. After the CM’s visit, she was referred to Aligarh because of her critical condition. The government ambulance refused to take her to Aligarh. I borrowed money and somehow arranged a private ambulance. But my child died. She was crying for help, but I could not save her,” Kumar said. At least 60 people, mostly children, have died due to viral fever in the last few days in the district. Komal was among five who died in the last 24 hours.

She was not able to speak, had a high fever and was vomiting blood. In critical condition, my child was referred to Aligarh. The ambulance driver dropped us home and refused to go to Aligarh. My husband arranged a private ambulance but she died on the way to Aligarh. I helplessly saw my child suffering, and dying.” She added, “My 12-year-old son Rohit, who was also suffering from fever, was not provided a bed at the hospital. He lay down on a bench. I have brought back my child to home as he too will die due to lack of proper treatment at the government hospital. I am arranging for money and will get him admitted at a private hospital.” Additional director of the health department, AK Singh said, “I will look into the allegations made by the family of the child. Chief minister has made it clear that strict action will be taken in case of any negligence towards treatment of the patients.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/assured-quick-recovery-by-cm-girl-15-dies-hours-later-kin-slam-doctors-apathy/articleshow/85843563.cms||Deepak Lavania

A division bench of justices M Duraiswamy and K Murali Shankar adjourned the case to September 20, for the SEC and the government to file a response in this regard. The court was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed in 2019 by K K Ramesh, a litigant appearing as party-in-person from Madurai district. In his petition, the petitioner stated that all the posts of elected representatives in the urban local bodies have been lying vacant since 2016 and no steps were taken to conduct the local body elections. He stated that with an intention to delay conducting the elections, the state government had announced the process of ward delimitation in 2017. Though he submitted a representation to the authorities seeking to conduct urban local body elections, no steps were taken in this regard. Hence, he moved the HC Madurai bench seeking relief.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-adjourns-plea-to-hold-urban-local-body-polls/articleshow/85848670.cms||---

Distributing sweets to celebrate the moment, the workers said that this has been their demand for many years. During the assembly election, both the DMK and the AIADMK had promised the relief for salt pan workers. Thanking chief minister M K Stalin, industries minister Thangam Thennarasu and Tuticorin MLA and minister for social welfare and women empowerment and Tuticorin MP Kanimozhi Karunanidhi for fulfilling their demand, the workers also sought a separate welfare board. They said that only a little more than 10,000 salt pan workers have been enrolled in the unorganised workers welfare board. “But there are at least more than 50,000 people working in the industry that sprawls on more than 25,000 acres in the district. Around 75% are women. The relief package that has been announced for the industry will not reach those who are not enrolled. The government should conduct an enumeration drive and ensure that the relief reaches them,” district secretary of the Tamil Nadu manual workers union, M Krishnamoorthy said. Priority in allotment of leased land for salt extraction to the workers by forming cooperative societies, basic amenities such as toilets and drinking water that is not available to most workers were among the other demands. Lack of such basic amenities is affecting the health of the workers who are working under the scorching sun for hours together, they said. They also sought a separate hospital or ward in a government hospital to attend salt pan workers suffering from occupational hazards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/salt-pan-workers-thank-govt-for-rs-5000-monsoon-relief/articleshow/85848668.cms||---

The eyes of the 43-year-old brain-dead patient, meanwhile, were sent to the Sushil Eye hospital in Trimbak Road. However, this did not require a green corridor. Poonam Hire, the transplant coordinator of Six Sigma Hospital, said the patient, a resident of the tribal Jawhar area in the district, had suffered a brain haemorrhage and was admitted to the hospital on August 28. During the course of treatment, the patient became brain dead. After he was declared brain-dead at 1 am on Wednesday, the organ transplant coordinators convinced his family members to opt for organ donation. The family readily agreed. Subsequently, the hospital management approached the city police for the creation of a green corridor from the Six Sigma Hospital to Ashoka Medicover. The city traffic police and the Gangpaur police created the green corridor to transport the liver over a stretch of 6 km within the city. The ambulance carrying the liver left the Six Sigma Hospital at 7.45 pm and reached Ashoka Medicover Hospital by 7.50 pm. Officials of the Six Sigma Hospital said a green corridor was not created to transport the eyes to Sushila Eye Hospital. Meanwhile, officials at Ashoka Medicover said a 60-year-old man (the recipient) was readied for the liver transplant surgery. ACP Seetaram Gavit said that all along the route, the point police were put on alert at the road signals for seamless transportation of the liver from one hospital to the other. Sanjay Rakibe, one of the transplant co-ordinators said the green corridor was set up for the first time since the second wave of Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/green-corridor-created-for-liver-transport-in-nashik-city/articleshow/85843589.cms||Santosh Sonawane

The 66-year-old suffered a cardiac arrest at the hospital ward and could not be revived, doctors said. She had been undergoing treatment at GEM Hospital for cardiac diseases. “She was stable. She returned to her bed after relieving herself in the morning when she had an arrest,” said a senior doctor treating her. The mortal remains of Vijayalakshmi were brought to OPS’s house in Periyakulam in Theni district by road. The final rites will be performed on Thursday morning. Chief minister M K Stalin, ministers and DMK leaders were among those to visit the hospital and offer condolences. Expelled AIADMK leader V K Sasikala caused a flutter when she arrived at the hospital to offer condolences, leaving behind their political rivalry that began in early 2017 when she wanted to become the CM by replacing him. It had resulted in OPS launching the ‘dharmayutham’ against her. OPS’s daughter K Kavitha Banu received her. Sasikala held Panneerselvam’s hands as he sobbed inconsolably. Sasikala consoles O Panneerselvam on WednesdaySasikala spent nearly half an hour at the hospital in the presence of former AIADMK ministers and MLAs. Governor Banwarilal Purohit, opposition leader and former CM Edappadi K Palaniswami, TNCC president K S Alagiri, MDMK general secretary Vaiko and Tamil Maanila Congress (M) president G K Vasan were among others who condoled the death of Vijayalakshmi. A BA graduate, she was among the four daughters and a son of Alagupandi Thevan and Valliammal, a farmer couple. A soft-spoken woman who married OPS on November 14, 1977 when he was AIADMK’s Periyakulam town secretary, she played the role of a supportive wife. Sources close to the family recalled that Vijayalakshmi was instrumental in maintaining a closely knit joint family of OPS, comprising his three younger brothers and as many sisters. She took up the responsibility of the joint family which helped Panneerselvam scale the party ranks and become CM, deputy CM, finance minister and take up various other responsibilities. Vijayalakshmi preferred to prepare the favourite dishes of her husband herself and he enjoyed being served by her. The couple has two sons and a daughter, P Raveendranath Kumar, V P Jayapradeep and K Kavitha Banu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/opss-wife-passes-away-stalin-sasikala-express-condolences/articleshow/85848696.cms||---
---||Madurai||HC dismisses appeal seeking refund of discontinuation fees||Madurai: Upholding the order of a single bench, the Madras high court has dismissed an appeal by a woman seeking to refund the discontinuation fees collected from her while she discontinued the super specialty course at Thanjavur Medical College. The court was hearing an appeal filed by Priya Sreeraj. The appellant had completed MBBS in 2009 and subsequently completed her postgraduation in medicine in 2015. Following a notification published by the state government for admission as a non-service candidate for the super specialty course for the year 2016-17, the appellant applied for the same and was allotted the course at Thanjavur Medical College in 2016. A condition was incorporated in the prospectus to the effect that in case of discontinuance of any candidature in respect of the course, a fee of Rs 5 lakh should be paid. The appellant in August 2016 discontinued the course by paying the discontinuation fee. The appellant filed a writ petition before HC Madurai bench in 2021 challenging the portion of the prospectus with respect to the discontinuation fee and also consequently sought to refund the fee paid by her. The single bench on March 21, dismissed her petition. A division bench of justices M Duraiswamy and K Murali Shankar observed that on a perusal of the materials available on record, it could be seen that the request for refund was rejected by the authorities in 2017, however, the appellant chose to file the writ petition only in 2021. It is a settled position that if a person is aggrieved over any order, the same should be challenged at the earliest point of time. The judges further observed that the appellant had knowledge about the condition imposed in the prospectus while joining the super speciality course. Having accepted the conditions, the appellant cannot turn around and subsequently, contend that the same cannot be applied to her case. The judges observed that the single bench, by taking into consideration all these aspects, has rightly dismissed the writ petition. “We do not find any ground to interfere with the order passed by the single bench,” said the judges while dismissing the appeal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-dismisses-appeal-seeking-refund-of-discontinuation-fees/articleshow/85848692.cms||Kaushik Kannan

The officials of Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC), said they would collect around 502 tonne of garbage per day on average during pre-Covid times, but the garbage collection has increased by 20% to 605 tonne per day in the last year. According to data provided by the NMC, the civic body collected 1.81 lakh tonne of garbage through garbage vans during the calendar year, 2019 (January-December.) But the collection of the solid waste increased by 20% to 2.18 lakh tonne during 2020 due to the pandemic with a daily average garbage collection of 606 tonne. The daily garbage collection increased further up to 630 tonne on average during the January-April period of the current calendar year. NMC officials said there has been a rise in garbage collection across six divisions of the city due to the pandemic. People were at home and they used single-use materials like plates, cups, spoons and other materials as part of preventive measures. “Similarly, hotels and restaurants provided parcel service to their customers and they used the single-use materials for packing food. This also led to a rise in garbage collection in the city,” said NMC officials. The civic body has deployed divisional level contractors in all the six divisions to collect garbage from door to door in the city and transport it to the compost plant at Pathardi. These contractors have provided 268 vehicles, including 12 small vehicles, to collect garbage from households and commercial establishments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/20-rise-in-garbage-collection-due-to-covid-in-nashik-city/articleshow/85843641.cms||Tushar Pawar

Private hospitals administering the jabs have also confirmed that their stocks were completely safe as they have procured them directly from the manufacturers. Notably, the World Health Organisation (WHO) in July had alerted about the presence of fake Covishield doses in parts of Africa and South East Asia including India. Talking to TOI, state nodal officer for vaccination Dr Rakesh Dayal said: “There is not even the slightest chance of any fake vaccine in the state as we are getting all of our supplies from the Government of India. All the doses, be it of Covishield or Covaxin, are being delivered to us under strict surveillance from GOI.” On being asked if the state health department has come across any usage or detection of fake vaccine in Jharkhand, Dr Dayal said that no such information has come to light. Meanwhile, TOI also contacted a few private hospitals which are administering Covishield vaccine in the city and they said that their stocks are verified as they have got their consignment directly from the Serum Institute of India (SII), Pune. “We had procured one lakh doses on May 31 from SII directly and we are utilizing the same stock till now so there is no question of fake vaccines,” Anand Srivastava, an official of the Medica hospitals group, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/health-dept-rules-out-possibility-of-finding-fake-vax-in-jharkhand/articleshow/85846824.cms||Gaurav Pandey

But the phones haven’t stopped ringing since then,” Laxman Karanjgaonkar, secretary, Gujarat State Athletics Association (GSCA) told TOI, adding that on an average the association gets more than a dozen calls from across the state. “There is a sudden buzz around track sports, especially javelin throwing. Young and aspiring athletes are inquiring about professional coaching for javelin and if there are any academy offering training,” Karanjgaonkar said. He added that even parents are contacting their association to get information about javelin throwing. Before Chopra’s golden success, javelin throwing was almost unheard of for years. “Chopra’s performance and the laurels as well as respect he earned after his achievement has changed everything for the Gujarati parents who are now eager to send their kids in athletics,” he added.

The power cut, which took place around 1:50pm on Tuesday, had brought all three HEC plants — foundry, forge and heavy machine building — to a grinding halt. Later in the day, sources said that in a letter to the state government, HEC has promised a down payment of Rs 1 crore with an assurance that it would clear the remaining power dues in suitable instalments. The sources added that a major portion of the Rs 129 crore outstanding bill comprised the delayed payment surcharge (DPS) that is levied by JBVNL for non-payment of power bills in full. Since October 1 last year, JBVNL has been charging DPS at the rate of 1%, instead of the 1.50% it was levying on unpaid power bills earlier. Sources said that though HEC has been paying the bill in instalments, its failure to clear its entire outstanding power bills at one go resulted in the levy of DPS on unpaid amounts each month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/power-restored-at-hec-after-9-hrs/articleshow/85846913.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The court while handing over the investigation of the case to the CBI observed that the police have neglected important aspects of the case. The police system seems to have failed and it’s a fit case to be taken up by the agency, the court observed. The court also said that there is a possibility of political intervention in the investigation and it ought to be investigated by the CBI, informed advocate Rajeev Kumar. Both Ranjan and Kumar had appeared for the state government in a criminal writ petition filed by Devanand Oraon, the father of Rupa Tirkey, seeking a CBI probe into her mysterious death. On August 13, the AG and the AAG informed the court that they have heard advocate Rajeev Kumar, the counsel of Devanand, say that he will surely win the case assessing 200 per cent success. The court of Justice S K Dwivedi directed the advocate general to file an affidavit with his statements made verbally before the bench. Advocate general Rajiv Ranjan declined to file any affidavit and stated that he has made oral submissions which can be quoted. Responding to AG’s submission, Justice Dwivedi had recused himself from hearing the case but later, on the direction of the Chief Justice, he continued to hear the case. On Wednesday, the judge mentioned that despsite giving several opportunities to the senior government counsels to tender an apology for questioning the integrity of a court of law, they refused to do so. Hence a show cause has been issued to them to explain why a proceeding of criminal contempt of court not be initiated against them. The matter will be heard again on September 18. Advocate Rajeev Kumar, the counsel of Devanand Oraon, had also filed a petition seeking initiation of contempt proceedings against the AG and the AAG on the ground of undermining the court’s authority. Rajeev Kumar said that the majesty of the court has to be maintained at all cost and no one can undermine the authority of a court of law. Devanand Oraon had filed the writ petition seeking a CBI inquiry into the death of his daughter, Rupa Tirkey, the officer in-charge of Sahibganj Mahila Thana. Tirkey was found hanging in her residential quarters on May 3 in Sahibgunj. While the police in their investigation have maintained that Tirkey’s death is a suicide, her father and relatives have claimed that she has been murdered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/hc-slaps-contempt-notice-on-ag-aag-orders-cbi-probe/articleshow/85846658.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The findings of the study, which was conducted by the varsity’s Energy Policy Institute, Chicago (EPIC) in 2019 across the country, were published on Wednesday. It has claimed that Jharkhand’s air quality was poorer than bigger states such as Maharashtra, Karnataka, Odisha and Gujarat. The study claimed that while WHO considered the air quality of a place as good if the particulate matter (PM) concentration was below 10 microgram per cubic meter, Jharkhand’s PM levels were at 85. The study claimed it based its research model on a study conducted by several scientists in China. As per the model, the study estimates 0.64 years of a person’s life is lost for sustained exposure to PM10 pollutants for every 10microgram additional pollutant. The study claimed that Ranchi, Ramgarh, Sahebganj and Seraikela-Kharsawan districts had PM concentration levels over 100. Bokaro, East Singhbhum and West Singhbhum districts had PM concentration levels of 94.52, 99.77 and 99.48, respectively. Coal mining hub Dhanbad had PM concentration levels of 95.3, it added. Ashirbad Raha, director of communications at EPIC India, said the study did not reach out to Jharkhand State Pollution Control Board for their pollution data. ‘Instead it is based on the satellite imagery and data prepared by the Atmospheric Composition Analysis Group based in the US.  While the study has put the average loss of lifespan in Jharkhand at 7.3 years, it has claimed the residents of the National Capital Region are likely to live 9.7 years less due to deteriorating air quality. Likewise, the residents of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Haryana are likely to lose out on 9.5 years, 8.8 years and 8.4 years of their lives, respectively, due to rising air pollution levels, the study has claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/worsening-air-quality-may-cut-short-lifespan-by-7-3-yrs/articleshow/85846648.cms||Dhritiman Ray

Tirkey’s body was found hanging from the ceiling of her house in Sahibganj in mysterious circumstances on May 3. Police initially dubbed it a case of suicide after an “unsuccessful love affair” and later held a sub-inspector Shiv Kumar Kanauja on charges of abetment to suicide. Tirkey’s parents, who are based in Ranchi’s Mandar block,, however, alleged it was murder and named three persons, including Pankaj Mishra, the CM’s political aide, as one of the key conspirators. Since then, her parents have been pressing for a CBI probe. The saffron camp also claimed credit for taking up Tirkey’s cause and being the first party to demand a probe by a central agency alleging that the Hemant Soren government was trying to cover up the case to save many “influential persons”. Tirkey was posted as officer in-charge of Mahila thana in Sahebganj district during the time of her unnatural death. On Wednesday, the high court, while hearing a petition filed by Tirkey’s parents for a CBI probe, finally ruled in their favour. The JMM, on the other hand, gave a lukewarm response but maintained that it too wants justice for the kin of the slain cop and state agencies were already working on the case in a professional manner. Talking to reporters at the party office, state BJP president and Rajya Sabha MP Deepak Prakash said, “We are hopeful and sure that many skeletons from the cupboard will start coming out. Right from the beginning, the state government was trying to cover up this case, levelling unwanted and baseless charges against the slain cop to defame her, as some influential persons close to the ruling party (JMM) are linked to the case. Now, the CBI will expose all of them.” He added that the BJP, especially its women wing, had staged numerous protests and stood through thick and thin with Tirkey’s family to fight for a CBI inquiry. Prakash reiterated that law and order under the current dispensation was deteoriating every day. “In over 18 months, more than 2,800 incidents of rape and crimes against women have been reported but government says all is well,” he said, taking a dig at the two-day investors’ meet held by the government in Delhi, adding that this will end up being yet another big scam of the Soren government. Prakash also criticised state government for disconnecting power to HEC as part of its vindictive politics. “For the first time in the history of HEC, its electricity was disconnected. It is only because DVC is pressing for its pending dues. If the state consumes DVC’s power, shouldn’t it pay? HEC is making defence products to strengthen our country’s army and by disconnecting power, the state government has exposed itself,” he said. HEC’s power was restored on Tuesday night. The JMM defended the state government’s stand on Tirkey’s case. The party’s general secretary, Supriyo Bhattacharya, said, “Every state government wants its own agencies to crack the cases. Hence, the state government had formed SIT which was working in a professional manner and also set up a judicial inquiry. The victim’s kin, however, approached the court seeking a CBI probe to which HC has agreed. We welcome it as even the party wants justice.” He, however rejected the BJP’s allegation that the state government was trying to prevent a CBI probe, stating, “In 2013, when our government was in power, we recommended a CBI probe into a fake surrender case. Later on, the BJP government filed an affidavit in court stating that the CID is competent to probe it and said it didn’t want a CBI inquiry. Similarly, in Bakoria fake encounter incident, even the NHRC said it must be probed by the CBI but the previous BJP government didn’t recommend it,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bjp-hails-court-nod-in-tirkey-case/articleshow/85846595.cms||ASRP Mukesh
---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: ASI caught red-handed taking bribe||CHATRA: A team from the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) arrested an assistant sub-inspector (ASI), Keshav Kumar Sharma, of Tandwa police station for accepting a bribe of Rs 3,000 from a local youth. The ACB had laid a trap to catch the erring official red-handed from the police station. ACB sleuths said that they had received a complaint from one Rajesh Kumar, a resident of Mishraul village, against the ASI after which they swung into action. Sources said Rajesh Kumar’s father, Lukan Ram, was made an accused in an assault case recently. Sharma was the investigating officer in the case and he had reportedly told Rajesh that he would favour the latter’s father while filing the investigation report if he paid him Rs 5,000. Sharma assured Rajesh that a favourable case diary will help his father in obtaining bail from the court easily. Rajesh then contacted the ACB for help. After an initial probe, the ACB laid the trap to nab Sharma red-handed. While Rajesh was giving Rs 3,000 to Sharma, bureau officials led by magistrate K K Singh barged into the office and caught the ASI. Singh said that the raid team took the accused to the ACB office in Hazaribag for further questioning. Officials from the local police station refrained from making any comment on the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/asi-caught-red-handed-taking-bribe/articleshow/85846738.cms||---

The victims were identified as Sumi Purty (68), her son Amar Purty (31) daughter-in-law Jeba (21) and daughter Baha (18). They were residents of Telanguri village in Barabambo in adjoining Seraikela-Kharsawan district. The four were crossing the tracks on their way from a bank to a relative’s house in Lodia in Chakradharpur when they were hit by the train, said cops at Chakradharpur police station. The impact of the collision was so huge that body parts of the victims were thrown to at least 30 metres, claimed local sources. The accident occurred about 50 metres from the railway crossing around 3.30pm. "All four were returning from a bank and heading to their relative’s house. They were hit while crossing the tracks,” Praveen Kumar, officer-in-charge of Chakradharpur police station, said on the basis of a preliminary investigation. Traffic movement on the down line of the Howrah-Mumbai route was affected for three hours after the accident. “Following the accident, train movement on the down line remained disrupted from 3.30pm to 6.25pm,” said senior DCM, Chakradharpur, Manish Pathak, adding that the third line was utilised for the diversion of the coaching trains.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/duronto-runs-over-4-of-family-in-west-sbhum/articleshow/85846714.cms||B Sridhar

He said that the government is squeezing money from the public on the one hand and trying to show that they are doing a great favour by giving free water on the other. The BJP government has increased the prices of diesel, petrol and LPG gas exorbitantly and people are unable to make ends meet during the pandemic, Barde said, adding that the move to supply water free is because BJP is worried about facing the electorate at the 2022 assembly elections. The government is making announcements to make good for the sufferings caused to the people due to its anti-people policies, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/forget-free-water-ensure-supply-ncp/articleshow/85848803.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||Goa: Tourism department undecided on beach shack licence rebate||PANAJI: The Goa government is yet to take any decision on giving beach shack allottees a discount on licence fees and the file proposing a rebate is presently pending with the government. Last month, the Shack Owners’ Welfare Society (SOWS) submitted a proposal to the tourism department asking for a reduction in licence and other fees charges for setting up seasonal shacks. “We have sent the proposal to the government requesting that relief be given to beach shack allottees and are awaiting a response,” a tourism official said. Shack allottees are seeking a rebate on the various fees owing to two back-to-back unprofitable seasons. While the government is yet to take a call, the shack owners are worried about the delay as it would stretch the process of setting up shacks. Goa has been seeing a steady flow of tourists even as Covid-19 restrictions are yet to be lifted fully. Hence, operators are looking forward to the new season. Mathew Fernandes, a shack operator from North Goa, said that they are hoping the government will reduce the licence fees, like last season, without further delay, so that they can initiate the process of setting up shacks. The validity of the three-year beach shack licences ends in 2021-22. “Though it takes four to five days to set up a shack, there might be a further delay when you have few hands to carry out the work,” said Fernandes. The allottees will be able to execute the work of setting up shacks only after the tourism department has finished the task of demarcation of shacks. The shack operators, he said, have not paid licence fees yet hoping that the government will reduce it. Seasonal shacks remain in operation from September to May. However for the past two seasons, due to the pandemic, shacks were compelled to shut operations two months in advance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tourism-dept-undecided-on-beach-shack-licence-rebate/articleshow/85848902.cms||---

A notification pertaining to the constitution of the board is likely to be issued shortly, a government official said. The tourism minister meanwhile, will serve as the vice-chairperson. TTAG had earlier opposed the Goa Tourism Policy 2020 proposition to name the tourism minister as the chairperson of the board. It has conveyed to the government that naming the chief minister of the state as chairperson would help obtain speedy approvals for bigger projects requiring authorisation from departments that are not in the domain of the tourism minister. Constitution of the tourism board will be crucial for the implementation of the tourism master plan, a vision document that’s aimed at the development of the state’s tourism sector. An official said that once the board is constituted, it will take crucial decisions regarding marketing and promotions as well as choosing projects for the hospitality sector, with the tourism master plan serving as the basis. The master plan has broadly outlined that the destination has to diversify its interests by presenting cultural, heritage, eco-tourism, nature, coastal and other attractions, and not merely focus on coastal tourism. The official said that while another side of Goa is being presented to tourists, efforts are piecemeal. Promoting nature, eco-tourism, for instance, will not progress full steam unless a proper ecosystem is created, he said. “The concept of homestays is yet to be established here. If facilities are made available, I’m sure tourists will grab the opportunity to explore the villages.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/nod-for-cm-as-chairman-of-tourism-board/articleshow/85848980.cms||---
---||Chennai||Bumper-to-bumper insurance order put on hold by Madras high court||CHENNAI: A Madras high court order making the five-year bumper-to-bumper insurance mandatory for all new vehicles from September 1, was put on hold by the court on Wednesday. Justice S Vaidyanathan, who passed the order last week, kept it in abeyance after insurance companies filed a memo saying they needed at least three months to design a new insurance product as per the directions of the court. Meanwhile, the joint transport commissioner, A A Muthu, had directed all Regional Transport Offices (RTOs) across Tamil Nadu not to register any vehicles without bumper-to-bumper insurance coverage, as directed by the high court. This uncertainty over the new insurance rule forced Tamil Nadu automobile dealers to put documentation works pertaining to vehicle registration on hold. Automobile dealers and insurance companies wondered how the order could be implemented without consulting the Insurance Regulatory Authority of India (IRDAI), the government body which supervises the insurance sector. "Since there was no clarity on how to finalise the insurance premium amount, we did not prepare any insurance certificates today (Wednesday). We will be meeting the state transport authorities and request them to reverse their earlier order" said S Rajvel, state chairperson of Federation of Automobile Dealers Association (FADA). "Usually, automobile dealers bring new vehicles to RTOs for registration only after preparing insurance certificates. It takes two or three days for them (from the date of invoice) to finish this insurance documentation. So, all new vehicles, which arrived today at RTOs, were sold to customers before the high court deadline of September 1. The new insurance rule was not applicable to any of these vehicles. Therefore, it was regular business at most city RTOs," said a Chennai RTO, requesting anonymity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/bumper-to-bumper-insurance-order-put-on-hold-by-madras-high-court/articleshow/85853760.cms||Ram Sundaram

Boat operators at the jetty said they are not operating any dolphin spotting trips in Mandovi River because of poor demand caused by the ongoing Covid pandemic. There are around 130 boats which operate from the Sinquerim jetty, with each boat getting at least one trip everyday during peak season. A boat can carry 14 passengers in one trip. “Boats from Nerul jetty, on the other bank of Sinquerim river, are making short trips within the river itself as there are a few tourists come asking for boat trips. We are hoping the number of tourists will increase after Ganesh Chathurthi,” a boat operator said, adding that the boats are instead going on fishing trips.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/dolphin-trips-yet-to-begin-at-sinquerim/articleshow/85849101.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Chandigarh||Punjab and Haryana high court allows habeas corpus plea on child’s custody||CHANDIGARH: In a case of its own kind, the Punjab and Haryana high court has allowed a habeas corpus plea filed by a US resident seeking the custody of his minor child, an American citizen, from his estranged wife. According to the HC, the natural process of grooming in the environment of the native country is indispensable for the comprehensive and conducive development of a child’s mental and physical faculties. The HC, however, has left it to the US court to determine the issue of guardianship of the minor. In this case, the minor boy had come to India for treatment along with his mother but she refused to take him back to re-join the company of her husband. US national seeks release of minor son from wife’s ‘illegal custody’Justice Arun Kumar Tyagi passed the order while allowing a petition filed by Kiran V Bhaskar, currently employed as a senior software engineer in Walmart Labs, Bentonville, Arkansas, USA, and a permanent resident of Benton Country, Arkansas, USA. He had filed a habeas corpus petition to ensure the release of his minor son from the “illegal custody” of his wife and in-laws’ family. The estranged couple got married in New York City on January 13, 2011 and had a male child in January 2016 in the USA. In January 2019, the child was diagnosed with a congenital condition called hydronephrosis that affects the kidneys and requires correction by surgery. Due to the non-availability of dates for surgery in Arkansas, the couple came to India for their son’s surgery in March 2019 and the petitioner returned to the USA after the surgery. After July 2019, the petitioner’s wife stopped providing updates about the health and progress of their son and did not allow the petitioner to interact with him. She also failed to return to the USA along with the minor child. On January 30, 2020, the man filed a petition for separate maintenance before the circuit court of Benton County, Arkansas seeking primary care, custody, and control of the child on account of wrongful detention of the minor child outside the USA. The court passed ex-parte order dated February 3, 2020, holding that the above-said court had jurisdiction over the parties and subject matter and was the proper venue for adjudication of the claim of custody and awarded primary care, custody, and control of the child to the petitioner and directed wife to hand-over minor child to the petitioner immediately noting that the alienation of the father from the son would be harmful to the wellbeing of the son. Finally, the man filed a habeas corpus petition before the Punjab and Haryana high court seeking custody of his minor son, who was living with his wife in Gurgaon. Responding to the issue, the wife contended that the standard medical care and ease of availability of medical advice is better in India. No early dates were being given in the USA for urgent surgery of the minor child and he had to be rushed to India. She also submitted that the minor child has friends in Delhi and Gurgaon, he has a wonderful opportunity to celebrate a variety of poojas and festivals in India which could never have been done in the USA. He goes every day to the temple at his maternal grandparents’ home where he stays. He has strong roots in India, the petitioner’s wife contended. During the hearing of the case, the HC appointed advocate Anil Malhotra as amicus curiae to assist the court on the issue. Malhotra interacted with both husband and wife separately on phone/ WhatsApp calls on a number of occasions. After interacting with them, the amicus, however, found that no mutually acceptable stand or neutral position can be arrived at which is agreeable to both sides. Hearing all the parties, the HC directed the wife to return to the USA along with the minor child on or before September 30 for which the petitioner would bear her and their minor child’s expenses for travel and incidental needs for their stay in the USA. The high court clarified that if the wife failed to return to the USA, she had to hand over custody of the minor child and his passport to the petitioner on October 1. “On return of the minor child to the USA, either of the parties shall be at liberty to revive the proceedings before US court for appropriate orders regarding the appointment of guardian and grant of custody of the minor child,” the HC ordered. HC observesUnless the minor child is immediately repatriated to the USA, his inherent potential and faculties would suffer an immeasurable setback.

---||Chandigarh||Plea for judicial probe by retired judge into Karnal lathicharge||CHANDIGARH: A petition has been filed before the Punjab and Haryana high court seeking judicial probe headed by a retired judge of the high court into the ‘violent’ action of police on farmers in Karnal on August 28. Several farmers had allegedly received brutal injuries in the police action. The plea in HC has also pleaded for registration of FIRs and departmental action, on the conclusion of inquiry, against the accountable police officials who were liable for giving orders to their subordinates to physically injure the farmers in the process of dispersing them. Directions have also been sought to look into the role of Karnal SDM Ayush Sinha, the young IAS officer who was seen in a video directing cops to smash the head of protesters, and other officers of civil and police administration in Karnal. According to the plea, the state of aggression and violent behaviour of police was an outcome of illegal orders of the SDM Karnal. A DVD regarding a video clip of the SDM has also been attached with the petition filed by Munish Lather, advocate and other residents of Haryana’s Karnal district who were injured in the August 28 incident. The petitioners have also sought directions to provide adequate compensation to all the injured farmers/victims for the infringement of their fundamental rights and illegally using physical force to disperse the peacefully protesting farmers. According to the petitioners, the members of civil administration as well as police administration in Karnal had acted illegally and brutally and dealt with unarmed peaceful agitators with undue force and brutality which has seriously jeopardised the fundamental rights of the citizens of India who have a right to demonstrate as provided under the constitution. “Any violation of the same gives a cause of action for the HC to mark an enquiry to be held from a retired high court judge in order to safeguard the fundamental rights, being custodian of the same and to look into the role of SDM Ayush Sinha, DSP Virender Saini and inspector Harjinder Singh as well as similar other violent civil and police officers,” the petitioners have submitted. It has also been alleged in the petition that the injured farmers were not provided medical aid immediately. It has also been alleged that some of the injured farmers were even threatened with not getting their X-ray examination done for reasons best known to police officials. One of the injured farmers suffered a heart attack and also died. The petitioners have impleaded additional chief secretary (home), DGP Haryana, SP Karnal, Virender Saini, DSP, Ayush Sinha, SDM, and inspector Harjinder Singh of Karnal as respondents in the petition. The petition is likely to come up for hearing next week. BOX ‘Still thriving in the dungeon of the past’ “Theoretically, the right to protest exists in India, however, practically, we are still thriving in the dungeon of the past where the demand for the existence of the ‘Right to Protest’ could label us non-compos mentis (of unsound mind).

---||Chandigarh||Will go with sweets for Hry CM if farmers given hike in cane MSP: Rajewal||Patiala: BKU Rajewal leader B S Rajewal on Wednesday said he would offer sweets to Haryana chief minister (CM) if he increases the price by Rs 50 per quintal for sugarcane crop. He offered one quintal laddoos in case the government repeal the farm laws and make a minimum support price (MSP) law. He also appealed to the masses to participate in mahapanchayat in Mujaffanagar on September 5. Rajewal was at Punjabi University in Patiala to address Student Kisan Mazdur Samyukt Sammelan, organised by the Student Welfare Association Group (SWAG) on Wednesday. He also lambasted Haryana CM for supporting the atrocious act of sub-divisional magistrate, who had ordered police to ‘break heads’ of farmers. “After the farmers in Punjab agitated against lower price of sugarcane, the government increased the price by Rs 50 per quintal. Same way, if Haryana CM announces an increase of Rs 50, I will bring laddoo for him and I will go with one quintal laddoos if the government brings MSP law after repealing three farm laws,” said Rajewal. According to him, farmers have lost the faith in judiciary. “In a democracy, there are only two ways to fight – violent and non-violent. A fight cannot be sustained with violence against the government. The only way to fight is with non-violence.” He claimed that so far 11 times the central government had held meeting with the farmers and every time, instead of bringing about a solution, farmer leaders were told to save their reputation. “The farmers in America had applauded the farmers of India for agitating against the corporates. The parliaments of around six countries have discussed about this laws and Modi was criticised. The United Nations also discussed about these issues and International Human Rights Organization also supported the farmers. Even when the entire world is watching, the police in Haryana had beaten up farmers five times,” said Rajewal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/will-go-with-sweets-for-hry-cm-if-farmers-given-hike-in-cane-msp-rajewal/articleshow/85849179.cms||---

Filing the special leave petition against the August 19 order of the HC, the state through advocate Suhan Mukherjee said CBI is already engaged in a witch-hunt against state officials and TMC leaders and that it apprehends the agency would use the post-poll violence as a ruse to foist false cases against TMC MLAs and ministers. It said the state has already filed an original suit under Article 131 of the Constitution raising a Centre-state dispute over the egregious transgression of the federal structure of governance by CBI in registering cases on incidents within the state despite the West Bengal government withdrawing the general consent enabling the agency to probe cases within the state. The SC had earlier ruled that CBI could probe cases in states, which have withdrawn general consent, only on the directive of HCs or SC or with prior consent of that state. But the state said the HC could not have directed a CBI probe to undermine the role of state police, which has promptly and effectively registered FIRs on post-poll violence complaints and arrested accused persons. The state said it apprehended that the Centre would use CBI to foist false cases against state functionaries in the guise of probe into post-poll violence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/west-bengal-challenges-calcutta-hc-verdict-in-sc-on-cbi-probe-in-post-poll-cases/articleshow/85853765.cms||---

The authority is expected to give its verdict shortly in the case, as has been directed by the high court. During the hearing, the hospitality company, which has constructed the wall claimed that land where the wall stands belongs to the hotel. Meanwhile, residents opposing the construction told GCZMA that survey plans do not support this claim. Various petitioners including the Vainguinim Valley Residents Association (VVRA), Bhanu Shirodkar, Goa Foundation and representatives of Kashinath Shetye were present, along with representatives of the hospitality company, against whom the allegations of CRZ violations have been made. Government officials from the WRD, tourism department and the GCZMA were in attendance. VVRA members Collin Curry and Aakash Madgavkar and another petitioner Shirodkar told the GCZMA that the hospitality company had no permissions for construction of the beach wall from competent licensing authorities. The residents said the hotel only has a conditional NOC from GCZMA to carry out ‘repair works’. VVRA told the coastal authority that the hotel had violated the conditions of the GCZMA NOC by using concrete in the structure and not eco-friendly material and by carrying out a new construction instead of ‘repairs’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/vainguinim-beach-wall-gczma-decision-shortly/articleshow/85849233.cms||---

The panel has dubbed these notices issued under Section 160 (police officer’s power to require attendance of witnesses) of the Code for Criminal Procedure (CrPC) as "provocative and terror-creating among the farmers". The two farmers—Karanpreet Singh of Jalandhar district and Maninderjit Singh of Faridkot district—have received the notice with regard to an FIR (first-information report) that was lodged on January 27 at the Mahindra Park police station, where they now must appear on September 3. A similar notice has gone to Punjab and Haryana high court advocate Surjit Singh Siwach, who is former secretary of the high court bar association. He was in Delhi on January 26. All three people called to the police station have been asked to bring their mobile phone and IDs. Their names don’t figure on the FIR. Panel convener Prem Singh Bhangu and members Raminder Singh Patiala, Inderjit Singh, Dharminder Malik, Vikas Shisher, and Kiranjit Singh Sekhon on Wednesday accused Delhi Police of acting at the behest of the central government, and said that the two farmers had neither been named in any FIR nor had they participated in any violent activity. The panel accused the central government of being worried by the intensification of the farmers’ agitation, in particular their August 26-27 convention and the Muzaffarnagar mahapanchayat coming up on September 5. Bhangu said: "The SKM panel advises farmers not to join the investigation because they can be implicated. The legal panel will meet shortly to review the situation. We also demand a murder case against the Karnal subdivisional magistrate who ordered use of force on the protesting farmers and overstepped his jurisdiction by ordering his troops to smash their heads of if they broke the cordon."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/dont-join-delhi-police-r-day-probe-skm-panel-to-2-pb-farmers-lawyer/articleshow/85849246.cms||---
---||Goa||Increase Griha Aadhar dole: GFP||Panaji: Goa Forward Party (GFP) criticised the state government on Wednesday for not doing enough to rein in the rising fuel and gas cylinder prices. GFP working president Kiran Kandolkar has demanded that the state government should increase the financial assistance for women under the Griha Aadhar scheme from Rs 1,500 to Rs 3,000 per month. GFP also criticised the state government for attempting to entice youth with the promise of government jobs ahead of the 2022 state assembly elections. “Cylinder prices were about Rs 350 per cylinder and petrol was around Rs 60 per litre when Congress was in the Centre before 2012. Today, the cylinder price is Rs 885 and petrol has crossed Rs 100 per litre. Palm oil is about Rs 110 per litre. If Parrikar could reduce VAT on petrol when Congress was at the Centre then why can’t Pramod Sawant do the same thing now when BJP is at the Centre?” said Kandolkar. Parrikar had capped the petrol price at Rs 60 and started Griha Aadhar scheme of Rs 1,000 per month to give relief to women to manage financial burden of homes. Parrikar’s successor Laxmikant Parsekar increased this financial assistance to Rs 1,500. “Now we demand that, if BJP really respects Manohar Parrikar then they should hike the Griha Aadhar from Rs 1,500 to 3,000. This will help common people,” Kandolkar said. Kandolkar on Wednesday inducted Mapusa Youth Group chief Pravin Asolkar and social workers Yogesh Asolkar, Sunny Bugde and Gaurish Subedar into GFP. GFP joint secretary John Nazareth said that the party is working with local social workers to try and build a base ahead of the coming elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/increase-griha-aadhar-dole-gfp/articleshow/85849441.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

It turned out that the project was taken up in violation of the norms for spending grants from the state government and was stopped in about a year’s time. The municipality had taken up the public Wi-Fi and CCTV surveillance project like other civic bodies. The project was cleared in May 2017 and Rs 35 lakh was spent on it. But the civic body goofed up when it came to identifying funds for the project and took it up from 14th finance commission grants. The grants have no heads for such expenses. In July 2018, the project was dropped by the civic body and it did not pay BSNL for the broadband charges. The cash-strapped municipality was to cough up Rs 6 lakh every year for broadband connectivity for the project. When the issue reached the regional commissioner of municipalities, a hearing was held. The regional commissioner passed an order in December last year ordering that the expenses for the project should be recovered from the councillors of the municipality who were present in the board meeting where the proposal was passed. An official said that 15 elected representatives were present in the meeting. One of them has since passed away. Municipality chief officer Vijay Italia has now issued notices to the councillors asking them to pay the money. The councillors have been given a time of 15 days to pay Rs 2.3 lakh each. If they fail to do so, their properties can also be attached. The councillors can, however, appeal against the decision too.

In her recent report, Dr Trinetra Haldar Gunnaraju said how even the ‘Competency Based Undergraduate Curriculum for the Indian Medical Graduate’ in 2018 was below expectations, and said: “…currently, for undergraduate students studying Forensic Medicine in their MBBS, the medical curriculum describes “sodomy”, “lesbianism” and oral sex as sexual offences, and “transvestism” (cross-dressing) as a “sexual perversion”.’ Justice N Anand Venkatesh, saddened by the report, said it reflected how queerphobia was being reaffirmed as legitimate throughout the education of a doctor who might go on to become a psychiatrist or any physician who might be approached by a person from the community. “As important as it is for an advocate or a judge to take up a client’s case or to decide the case, as the case may be without being personally judgemental about them, it is equally or even more important for a professional from the medical and mental health professionals’ fraternity to be non-judgemental and free of moral or personal prejudices about their patient’s or client’s identity on the gender spectrum or their sexuality,” said Justice Anand Venkatesh. When informed that a psychiatrist had prescribed two medicines Stimuli Capsule and Fluoxet capsule to a gay man and referred him to a psychotherapist for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy 10 for M2M behaviour, Justice Anand Venkatesh said: “This sample case clearly exhibits the ignorance on the part of the doctor who is not even aware that there is no “cure” for gender identity. These are ways and means adopted by professionals under the guise of conversion therapy. Prescribing anti-depressants and erectile dysfunction drugs to a person and referring them into cognitive behavioural therapy as “remedy” to their gender identity and sexuality is nothing but conversion “therapy”, camouflaged as medical and mental health support.” The judge then said this lack of knowledge on the part of the psychiatrist was directly attributable to the course that was undergone by him and which was yet to be revamped and brought up to date. Justice Anand Venkatesh also gave a piece of his mind to police and media, and said: “The reportage of the most intimate and personal aspects of an individual’s identity by the contemporary vernacular media is deeply problematic and it not just reflects the pre-existing harmful stigmatisation of the community, but also perpetuates it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/queerphobia-even-among-doctors-worries-madras-high-court/articleshow/85853793.cms||Suresh Kumar

However, according to met officials, the region still has time to improve upon the situation as “good rainfall” is expected in September. Talking to TOI, deputy director general of the Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC), Nagpur, RM Sahu informed that the region received around 679 millimeters (mm) of rainfall between June to September 1 against the normal of 693mm for the period. “Despite being deficit, rains in Vidarbha are still under normal category,” he said. Four districts in the region have been most deficit – Amravati (28%), Gadchiroli (25%), Gondia (24%) and Buldhana (20%). “Nagpur is 4% deficit till now,” said Sahu. Yavatmal has been the wettest followed by Washim. “Every year, the districts receiving excess, normal or deficit rains are different. Although Gondia and few other districts received good quantity of rainfall, they are under the deficit category because their mean normal is on the higher side,” added Sahu. TOI had earlier reported about the long-range forecast of the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) which had predicted excess rainfall in many parts of Central India, including parts of Vidarbha. Confirming that the deficit has been more than what was predicted, met officials attributed multiple reasons for it. “The monsoon had a lingering journey over Central India, one of the reasons for which was less depressions developing in the Bay of Bengal which affected the rainfall in Vidarbha. Also, the typhoons formed in the Indian Pacific ocean boost rainfall in Central India. However this time, the negative phase of Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) caused less rainfall here,” added officials. There is still hope as met officials are expecting the loss to be recovered this month. “The meteorological conditions are indicating of good rainfall activity in the coming days. Vidarbha might get more rainfall, thus improving the overall situation,” said officials. In June, IMD had predicted that the southwest monsoon rainfall over the country will be 96-104% of the Long Period Average (LPA). According to its latest report, northwest and Central India have reported maximum departure from the normal rains. “Above normal rainfall to normal rainfall is expected over many parts of Central India,” said IMD officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/14-rainfall-deficit-in-vid-but-sept-looks-good/articleshow/85849417.cms||Manka Behl

Our election committee decides about the party tickets, and their decision is accepted by all,” Tanavade said. Tanavade was asked the question during a press conference against the backdrop of speculations in political circles that former Vasco municipal councillor Krishna alias Daji Salkar was emerging as a probable candidate. Tanavade recently visited several areas in Vasco seeking support for the party. During his visit, BJP inducted former members who had quit the party during the council elections and contested either independently or on other party banners. “These workers who had gone astray have realised that our party is the best platform, and so have rejoined us," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-bjp-chief-evades-queries-on-party-candidate-for-vasco/articleshow/85849593.cms||---
---||India||West Bengal faults SC ruling on UPSC role in DGP pick||NEW DELHI: After taking up cudgels with Centre by filing a suit in SC to stop CBI from registering cases in West Bengal, the Mamata Banerjee government on Wednesday told the Supreme Court that its landmark 2006 police reforms judgment erred legally and constitutionally by assigning the UPSC the task of selecting a panel of three officers for the post of a state DGP. In the landmark Prakash Singh judgment 14 years ago, the SC had ruled that states were required to select the DGP from among three senior-most police officers empanelled by the UPSC to stop the states from selecting a regime sensitive police officer to the top post and had granted the DGPs a fixed tenure of two years irrespective of their age of retirement. Last week, the SC had castigated the police officers for cosying up to ruling parties and registering cases against political opponents on flimsy or frivolous grounds only to face the heat at the hands of their colleagues when the regime changed. CJI N V Ramana-led bench had said that the persecution of police officers, who worked at the behest of the earlier regime, must serve as a lesson for the entire police force across the country. Appearing for WB, senior advocate Sidharth Luthra on Wednesday requested a CJI-led bench for urgent hearing on the state’s plea seeking autonomy in selecting its DGP, whose tenure has come to an end on August 31. It said the SC’s 2006 judgment was “not in consonance with extant constitutional and legal framework” and deprived the states of their autonomy in selection of DGP/head of police force (HOPF) from amongst the senior-most IPS officers in the state cadre. Reading the constitutional provisions to the SC to assail the much praised police reforms judgment, the Bengal government said, “the Constitution does not vest UPSC with the power to assess the respective merit of the officers holding the rank of DGP in the state for determining the fitness to be appointed as the DGP, HOPF of the state, since it is the state government which can have the proximate opportunity to assess the fitness of officers of that rank who had rendered service to the state in the state cadre.” It said the UPSC’s role is limited to providing consultation on the principles to be followed in the promotion and transfer and on the suitability of the candidates for such appointments and not to usurp the state’s jurisdiction to select the officers for a panel as directed by the SC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/west-bengal-faults-sc-ruling-on-upsc-role-in-dgp-pick/articleshow/85853818.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

This makes significance as the world’s largest coal miner can now cut down on its usage of over 4 lakh kilolitres of diesel per annum with an annual expense of around Rs 3,500 crore. The company in association with GAIL (India) and BEML has taken up a pilot project for retrofitting LNG kits in its two 100 tonne dumpers working at the subsidiary Mahanadi Coalfields (MCL). CIL on Tuesday signed an MoU with GAIL and BEML to get this pilot project executed. “Once the LNG kit successfully retrofitted and tested, these dumpers will be able to run on dual fuel system i.e. both on LNG and diesel and their operations will be significantly cheaper and cleaner with use of LNG,” a senior CIL official said. According to him, this move will prove to be a game changer. The company has over 2,500 dumpers running in its opencast coal mines. The dumper fleet consumes about 65% to 75% of total diesel consumed by the company. “LNG will replace the use of diesel by about 30% to 40% and reduce the fuel cost by about 15%. The move will reduce carbon emission significantly and also save around Rs 500 crore annually if all existing Heavy Earth Moving Machines (HEMMs) including dumpers are retrofitted with LNG kit. Getting rid of diesel pilferages and adulteration are other added advantages,” said a senior CIL executive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/cil-dumpers-to-have-lng-kit-to-cut-carbon-footprint/articleshow/85847362.cms||---

It is a great thing that even Pramod Sawant has realised that the Kejriwal model is the only thing that can save Goa. Arvind Kejriwal was the first CM in India to provide free water to the residents of his state, Delhi in 2015. Today six years later, finally we see that BJP, whose leaders are so arrogantly against providing Goenkars with services, deserve, forced to accept the Kejriwal Model,” he said. Before announcing free water, the government should first ensure water reaches all homes. “There are taps but no water. There’s a slogan ‘har ghar jal’, but in taps there is no water. They should first ensure water supply and then give 16,000 litres free,” Mhambre said. Taking credit for the announcement, Mhambre said it was AAP that first promised 300 units of power free in Goa when the chief minister and power minister raised the issue of debts. “The government has woken up and now knows what people in Goa want,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/aap-govt-first-to-give-free-water/articleshow/85849768.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

A statue of the leader installed on the arterial road earlier was vandalised on December 24, 1987, hours after then CM M G Ramachandran died at his residence in Ramavaram Gardens. The statue was damaged in the ensuing violence. It was installed by the Dravidar Kazhagam in 1975 to fulfill the dream of party founder E V Ramasamy (Periyar) at the junction of General Patters Road and Anna Salai in Chennai. It was unveiled by religious leader Kundrakudi Adigal. “Dravidar Kazhagam president K Veeramani met me a couple of days ago and urged me to reinstall the statue of Kalaignar Karunanidhi on Anna Salai. When I explained to him the court order regarding the installation of statues in public places, he (Veeramani) informed me that the statue was installed 45 years ago after obtaining the then government’s permission,” Stalin said in the assembly while replying to Thiru Vi Ka Nagar MLA V Neelakandan (DMK), during the debate on demands for grants for various departments. Neelakandan, while participating in the debate, appealed to the CM to install again a statue of the former CM on Anna Salai. “We will discuss with legal experts and take efforts to install the former CM’s statue on Anna Salai without disturbing the public and traffic flow,” Stalin said. There are statues of Periyar and former chief ministers C N Annadurai and M G Ramachandran on Anna Salai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-government-to-install-m-karunanidhi-statue-again-on-anna-salai/articleshow/85853835.cms||---

In an appeal, former foreign ministers Natwar Singh and Yashwant Sinha, Mani Shankar Aiyar, Julio Rebeiro, Najeeb Jung, Vedpratap Vaidik, Saeed Naqvi, former diplomat K C Singh, Sandeep Pandey, Majeed Memon and Sudheendra Kulkarni welcomed the first official outreach to the Taliban by the government. “There should be no discrimination on grounds of religion in providing shelter to Afghans who have been forced to leave their country,” the statement said. The statement asked government to “permit temporary stay to Afghan journalists, artists and civil society leaders who are feeling threatened by the conditions in their country.” In a signal to the polarising politics that may play out before the forthcoming UP elections, the statement said, “no political party should be allowed to use the developments in Afghanistan to communally polarise Indian society for electoral gains and any such attempts should be dealt with sternly.” They appealed to the international community to not isolate the Taliban and advance humanitarian assistance to the people of Afghanistan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/dont-let-afghan-soil-be-used-by-terror-outfits-taliban-urged/articleshow/85853850.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Vasco-Kulem rail route to be completed by March 2022||MARGAO: Work of South Western Railway’s (SWR) double tracking project on the Goa stretch, which was affected on account of the reverse migration of labourers on account of the pandemic, has now gathered pace. Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd (RVNL) has completed laying the second track between Kulem to Majorda. Railway sources said that a trial run on the second track on this stretch will be conducted soon. RVNL has now set March 2022 as its target for completing the double tracking of the Vasco-Kulem route. Work on certain stretches between Majorda and Vasco has been grounded owing to stiff opposition from locals. The report of the Central Empowered Committee (CEC) recommending to the Supreme Court cancellation of the double tracking project has added ammunition to the opposition. The CEC in its report submitted to the court on April 23 termed the project as “inefficient”, “unjustified” and “potentially destructive” even as it has raised concerns about the threat to the biodiversity hotspot of Mollem, and pointed to the failure of the Railways in utilising most of the existing capacity of the single railway track. Sources said that considering the opposition, the 17-km Majorda-Vasco stretch is likely to be delayed though it will not affect the commissioning of the double-tracked route in Goa. Deputy collector, Mormugao, who has been appointed as the competent authority and the land acquisition officer, is currently conducting hearings on the objections filed against land acquisition for the double tracking project. Electrification of the double tracked route is also underway on the Goa section. “Areas which haven’t yet been double tracked will also be electrified and made operational as a single line track,” a senior official of the Indian Railways said. The entire Hospet-Hubli-Tinaigat-Vasco double-tracked route will also be electrified.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/vasco-kulem-rail-route-to-be-completed-by-mar-2022/articleshow/85847561.cms||---
---||Vadodara||Appeals against 54 lockdown violators rejected by court||VADODARA: In another blow to the state government, a sessions court in Vadodara dismissed 28 appeals filed against 54 lockdown violators in one go. The state government, last September, had decided to appeal against lower courts’ orders striking down police chargesheets in connection with FIRs lodged for lockdown violation under section 188 of Indian Penal Code (IPC). The government through an additional public prosecutor had filed 28 appeals against 54 lockdown violators in April in the additional sessions court at Savli, terming the lower courts’ orders as illegal and contrary to the provisions of the law. The sessions court was requested to set aside the lower courts’ orders and allow trial against all 54 accused. Additional sessions judge A J Kanani rejected all appeals terming them not maintainable as the trial court had refused to acknowledge FIRs, that are filed under section 188 of the IPC, as section 195 of Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) bars it to take cognizance of it. The sessions court stated that the trial courts had dismissed the cases without going into the merits of the case and disposed of them. The court stated that such dismissals, discharged the accused and not acquitted them, which makes an appeal unmaintainable. The court thus concluded that it would not be in the interest of the law to intervene in lower courts’ orders. In August last year, TOI had reported about a Vadodara court’s dismissal of three lockdown violation cases following which the director of the prosecution had directed all district government pleaders to file appeals in all such cases. Later, the Gujarat Assembly also amended the CrPC so that section 195 of it does not bar lower courts from taking cognizance of chargesheets filed in connection with section 188 of IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/appeals-against-54-lockdown-violators-rejected-by-court/articleshow/85843271.cms||Jay Pachchigar

Advocate Norma Alvares representing Goa Foundation told the high court that till date the road constructed across the river has been washed away three times, last on August 31. According to the forest department the project of “repairing” the mud road is underway with the PWD stating that it is being carried out at a cost of Rs 2.6 crore per km. The total project length is 12km. The Goa Foundation has challenged the authority of the additional principal chief conservator of forests to file the affidavit as he is not appointed under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. It filed a PIL in view of the construction of a road using concrete pavers inside Mollem national park from the main entrance of the Mollem national park at Mollem up to Dudhsagar waterfalls via Collem. The additional principal chief conservator of forests Santosh Kumar stated that the work undertaken by the PWD is in the nature of repair of the existing road and does not involve its widening therefore no permission of the Union environment ministry, state wildlife board or national board of wildlife is required.

The sanctuary used to be known as Orang Game Reserve until 1985, when the then Congress government renamed it the Rajiv Gandhi Wildlife Sanctuary. A local campaign led to the name “Orang” being restored as part of the official nomenclature of this stunning 79 sqkm vista of forest and grasslands that are home to the one-horned rhinoceros, Royal Bengal tiger and the Asian elephant, among other species. “Taking cognizance of the Advasi and tea tribe community’s demands, the cabinet has decided to rename Rajiv Gandhi National Park as Orang National Park,” minister Pijush Hazarika said on Wednesday. Instead of the state secretariat that is usually the venue of cabinet meetings, CM Himanta Biswa Sarma chose to complete the formality of passing the proposal at Koinadhora State Guest House, which served as the official residence of his estranged mentor and former CM Gogoi for 15 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/assam-government-removes-rajiv-gandhis-name-from-orang-national-park/articleshow/85853915.cms||Prabin Kalita

In a letter to municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B, the traffic police said that several tar roads in the Cotton Market zone are in a dilapidated state and “this may create law and order situation during transportation of Ganesh idols”. A senior traffic cop from the office DCP (traffic) stated that the Cotton Market zone of the department has raised the issue of pothole-ridden, damaged or dug up roads in central Nagpur with the civic authorities. “Damage roads mean a bumpy ride for the procession of Ganesh idols starting from Mahal, which is the main market for idols, to the respective mandals or houses across the city,” the cop said. The cop further said that no specific points or stretches have been mentioned in the letters sent to all the three assistant municipal commissioners of Gandhibagh, Satranjipura and Dhantoli zones and to the civic chief. “Most of the tar roads criss-crossing these three zones are really in a bad shape,” he said. Corporators from these zones too said that tar roads in their respective prabhags need to be repaired. Senior corporator Abha Pande and Congress corporator Bunty Shelke said that there are many potholes on roads in Itwari, Gandhibagh, Satranjipura and Mahal. A senior official from the NMC’s hotmix department said that it has already started road restoration, patching and other works. “Due to rain, the NMC is finding it difficult to fill the potholes,” the official said. The patchwork has filled the potholes, but has made the surface uneven and created bumps. “This shoddy work has also left the mandals worried. We are worried about carrying the idols safely,” said convener of Ekta Ganesh Mandal and ex-MLC Prakash Gajbhiye.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/repair-potholes-on-routes-of-idol-processions-traffic-cops-to-nmc/articleshow/85848024.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

However, according to met officials, the region still has time to improve upon the situation as “good rainfall” is expected in September. Talking to TOI, deputy director general of the Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC), Nagpur, RM Sahu informed that the region received around 679 millimeters (mm) of rainfall between June to September 1 against the normal of 693mm for the period. “Despite being deficit, rains in Vidarbha are still under normal category,” he said. Four districts in the region have been most deficit – Amravati (28%), Gadchiroli (25%), Gondia (24%) and Buldhana (20%). “Nagpur is 4% deficit till now,” said Sahu. Yavatmal has been the wettest followed by Washim. “Every year, the districts receiving excess, normal or deficit rains are different. Although Gondia and few other districts received good quantity of rainfall, they are under the deficit category because their mean normal is on the higher side,” added Sahu. TOI had earlier reported about the long-range forecast of the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) which had predicted excess rainfall in many parts of Central India, including parts of Vidarbha. Confirming that the deficit has been more than what was predicted, met officials attributed multiple reasons for it. “The monsoon had a lingering journey over Central India, one of the reasons for which was less depressions developing in the Bay of Bengal which affected the rainfall in Vidarbha. Also, the typhoons formed in the Indian Pacific ocean boost rainfall in Central India. However this time, the negative phase of Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) caused less rainfall here,” added officials. There is still hope as met officials are expecting the loss to be recovered this month. “The meteorological conditions are indicating of good rainfall activity in the coming days. Vidarbha might get more rainfall, thus improving the overall situation,” said officials. In June, IMD had predicted that the southwest monsoon rainfall over the country will be 96-104% of the Long Period Average (LPA). According to its latest report, northwest and Central India have reported maximum departure from the normal rains. “Above normal rainfall to normal rainfall is expected over many parts of Central India,” said IMD officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rainfall-in-vid-14-deficit-but-sept-looks-good/articleshow/85848210.cms||Manka Behl
---||India||Won’t meddle in Kashmir: Long-time Taliban ally Haqqani Network||NEW DELHI: Long-time Taliban ally Haqqani Network looks at Kashmir as being beyond its “jurisdiction” and, hence, any interference there would be against its stated policy, the outfit’s scion Anas Haqqani said in an interview with CNN-News18 on Tuesday, coinciding with the last of the US troops leaving the Afghan capital. Seeking to build on the feelers sent by Taliban leader Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai to the Indian government, Anas said that the new regime in Afghanistan wanted a “good relationship with India” and was “ready to forget everything and take the relationship forward.” The Haqqani Network is an Afghan guerrilla insurgent group that has been part of the Taliban since 1995. Anas is the youngest son of the late founder of the outfit, Jalaluddin Haqqani. Afghanistan crisis live updatesAnas said that just as his outfit wouldn’t meddle in the Kashmir issue, the Haqqanis would expect others not to interfere in Afghanistan’s internal matters. On whether that commitment also meant the Haqqani Network wouldn’t support Pakistan-backed Jaish-e-Muhammed and Lashkar-e-Taiba’s terror activities in Kashmir, Anas dismissed all such talk as “propaganda” and distanced himself from Pakistan vis-a-vis J&K. Read AlsoQaida cheers Afghanistan ‘victory’, says Kashmir next targetExulting over the "victory" of the Taliban over America, the global terror group called for launching the next stage of the "struggle, the way for which has been paved by the victory of the defiant Afghan nation".He alleged that the Indian media “is spreading negative propaganda about us” and “spoiling the atmosphere”. “We don’t want anyone to think wrong about us. India has helped our enemy for 20 years but we are ready to forget everything,” he said.

He said that since taking over Afghanistan, the Taliban had proved it would carry everyone along. “There was some panic and fear initially, but now things have settled and people are happy. Afghan Sikhs and Hindus are like any other communities of Afghanistan and they would live happily.” On pending development projects in Afghanistan involving India, Anas said the Taliban would seek help not only from India but also the rest of the world to continue the work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/wont-meddle-in-kashmir-haqqani/articleshow/85853947.cms||---

However, health minister Ma Subramaniam clarified on Wednesday that the state cannot be among the top performers in the country anytime soon. “This is mainly because between January and April, when vaccines were available, Tamil Nadu did not vaccinate an adequate number of people. The AIADMK government, which was in power, did not create adequate awareness and the average vaccinations a day was around 61,000 taking the tally to just 63 lakh. During the same (period), several states like Gujarat and Rajasthan made better use of the vaccine,” he said after visiting Loyola College on reopening day. “After we came to power, we have vaccinated more than 2.6 crore people in 116 days.” In the same time, other states continued to vaccinate people in large numbers. At least 70% of people in Gujarat and 65% in Rajasthan have received at least one dose of the vaccine compared to less than 40% in Tamil Nadu. TN’s neighbours like Kerala (80%), Karnataka (66%) and Andhra Pradesh (56%) have also covered a larger population. Data showed that just 10% of TN’s 6 crore adults have completed both doses, the minister said. For September, the Centre promised more than 1.4 crore doses of the vaccine. “At government centres, more than 3 crore people have been vaccinated. We have pushed up vaccinations at private hospitals by offering free vaccinations using CSR funds,” Subramaniam said. “We will increase daily vaccinations to at least 6 lakh in the coming days and we have the capacity to vaccinate up to 8 lakh people every day.” Data from the immunisation wing of the state health department showed that vaccine utilization is above 90% in all districts and goes up to 104% in some districts. While seven districts reported 100% vaccine utilization, nine others are at more than 100%. For instance, Cheyyar and Sivakasi report utilization of 104% by using additional doses in the vials. Kodaikanal hits 100% 1st dose coverage:All eligible residents of Kodaikanal town have taken their first dose of the Covid vaccine, Dindigul collector S Visakan said. “In Palani municipality too, we have administered vaccines to more than 98% of the eligible population and will achieve 100% vaccination in upcoming weeks,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/tamil-nadu-may-soon-hit-6-lakh-covid-vaccination-shots-a-day-but-state-is-still-far-behind-others/articleshow/85860050.cms||---

---||Goa||Goa: Lust for dream car drove Davorlim youth to snatch gold chains||MARGAO: It was his dream to own a Toyota Fortuner that led 21-year-old Mohammed Sarfaraz to steal gold chains from unsuspecting women, which finally landed him in the police’s dragnet. Sarfaraz, a resident of Davorlim, along with his accomplice, 24-year-old Ajay alias Rooney, a resident of Ponda and native of Belagavi, were arrested by the Maina-Curtorim police recently. The chain-snatching gang, police sources said, has been involved in at least 15 cases across Goa. Sarfaraz had a penchant for driving luxury cars and the Toyota Fortuner had caught his imagination. He had set his eyes on owning the car of his dreams although he knew he couldn’t afford to buy one. His lust for the car got the better of him and he resorted to stealing. To make his task easier, he chose what he thought would be soft targets – women. Sarfaraz, with his accomplice, would stalk women walking alone on secluded streets and snatch their gold chains before fleeing from the spot. They would sometime use a two-wheeler while committing the crime. The sudden rise in the number of chain-snatching incidents had baffled the police, who succeeded in obtaining a major lead in investigation when they identified Sarfaraz as the main culprit. Police teams were formed to nab the youth and a major breakthrough was achieved when Sarfaraz walked into the police dragnet on August 22. Subsequently, his accomplice, Ajay, was also arrested. Sources said that a couple of days before his arrest, Sarfaraz had confided to his friends that he had “earned” enough to buy the “Fortuner” and that he would soon make his dream come true. Police sources said the two accused would sell the stolen gold chains to Lilesh Lotlikar, a goldsmith based in Borda, Margao, who would melt the ornaments to destroy any trace of evidence that he had purchased the stolen booty. Sarfaraz spilled the beans during police investigations and Lotlikar was arrested too. The police have so far recovered 182g of gold in molten form worth Rs 8 lakh from Lotlikar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/lust-for-dream-car-drove-davorlim-youth-to-snatch-gold-chains/articleshow/85848527.cms||Govind Kamat Maad

He said the proposed building would be modelled on commercial complexes in Singapore and a detailed technical study will be carried out to take forward the project during the current financial year. Announcing that work on the third master plan for the Chennai metropolitan area had started, the minister said it was being done with World Bank funding. “Public and stakeholders will be encouraged to actively participate in the entire process of preparing the master plan,” he said. The Chennai metropolitan area would be expanded by adding more areas from Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur districts and Arakkonam based on a public hearing. Muthusamy said an integrated township on 770 acres would be established along the ORR linking Vandalur and Minjur. “We have also studied the factors that affected the development of 143 villages on the outskirts of Chennai and found that lack of road connectivity was the major cause that hindered development. So, we are preparing a grid of roads, covering the villages,” he said. The proposed TN commerce hub at Nandanam would be re-examined and taken up if it was feasible, he said. He said 7,032 families residing on the banks of Adyar and Cooum rivers would be relocated in the tenements under construction, which would be completed by June 2022. Moreover, the department planned to construct 9.5 lakh tenements and individual houses under housing for all programme for the poor before 2030. And, 53,300 units of affordable rental housing would be constructed for migrant workers. The department would also constitute metropolitan development authorities for Madurai, Coimbatore-Tirupur, and Hosur. Of the state’s total geographical area of 1,30,060sqkm, only 8,138sqkm (7%) was covered under the directorate of town and country planning’s master plan till date, he said. The department had taken efforts to increase the coverage of planned area to 29,093sqkm (22%).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/25-acre-business-centre-at-foreshore-estate-to-be-a-chennai-landmark/articleshow/85854021.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Willing to be quizzed at home, TMC MP Abhishek Banerjee’s wife writes to ED||KOLKATA: Trinamool Congress leader Abhishek Banerjee’s wife Rujira did not appear before Enforcement Directorate’s office in New Delhi on Wednesday, citing her inability to move along with her daughters in the prevailing pandemic situation. Rujira, who was earlier questioned by the central investigating agency in connection to the illegal coal mining scam, assured her cooperation with ED. In a letter to ED assistant director Sumat Prakash Jain, Rujira said she was mother of two infants and “travelling to New Delhi physically in the midst of the pandemic put my and the lives of my children at grave risk”. In the letter dated August 31, she said she was ready to face questioning by ED at her home. Rujira urged ED officials to come to her Kolkata home and question her because the agency had an office in the city. “Besides, as per my understanding, the alleged cause of action of the subject matter of your inquiry too arises out of West Bengal,” she added. Rujira asked ED to communicate their decision while iterating her willingness to cooperate with the agency. This February, days before the Bengal assembly polls, CBI officials came to Rujira’s Harish Mukherjee Road home for questioning. A six-member team, including two women officers, questioned her; sources close to the family pointed to extra-legal motives of the officers. The ED had filed a case based on the November 2020 FIR of CBI under relevant sections of PMLA in the illegal coal mining scam. The agency also sent summons to Abhishek asking him to appear on September 6, followed by two senior IPS officers on September 8 and 9. Sources close to Abhishek on Wednesday indicated there was no confirmation whether the Trinamool leader would appear before the agency’s office in Delhi next week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/willing-to-be-quizzed-at-home-abhisheks-wife-writes-to-ed/articleshow/85849776.cms||Rohit Khanna
---||Kolkata||90-plus in boards, but still facing admission jitters||KOLKATA: High marks? Check. Choice of colleges? Think again. This has been the story of a large section of the school-leaving batch of 2021. Many of them with good scores in Class XII boards — even in the high 90s — have discovered that getting a seat in a subject of their choosing in a college of their choice is next to impossible, thanks to the fierce competition in a pandemic-scarred year, where several hundred students have scored as much, or even higher. Whereas in other years, these students’ high scores would have opened most doors, this year’s stratospheric marks have forced them to wait for the first round of admissions to be over to know whether a second list would be issued, and whether they still stand a chance. With the board examinations cancelled this year and results calculated on the basis of formulae worked out by each examination board, the record number of students who have scored over 90% and 95% had carried an indication that cut-offs would be 1.5% to 2% higher in most colleges this year. With each board also keen that students do not suffer in a pandemic year, more students figured in the top bracket this year than they have ever done prior to the pandemic. The high-marks-for-more approach has, expectedly, made the entry process that much tougher. A student who secured 97% in ISC is yet to secure admission. His mother is in shock. “Had the exams been held, there’d have been a fair assessment of students and the results more realistic. My son was preparing for the exam. Instead, he received 97% according to the formula but that score does not seem to be enough now,” she said. ‘The picture will be clearer in a few days’The father of another aspirant said his daughter was spending sleepless nights worrying about whether she would get to study in a college of her choice despite securing 94% in ISC and applying for admission in 10 colleges. “This is a crazy situation. And it isn’t just my daughter. There must be so many students and their parents who are faced with this situation,” he said. Stuti Banerjee, who secured 97% in ISC, and has applied for physics honours at only Bethune, Lady Brabourne and Jadavpur University is scared. “The colleges have called the first 24-30 students for online reporting; my name does not figure. I now have a feeling that I should have applied to more colleges just to be safe,” she said. Sharanya Mallick, who has got 90% in HS, has submitted forms for sociology and geography. Her name is still on the waiting list. “I wanted to study geography but my rank in sociology is better. So, I think I will opt for the later rather than lose the opportunity altogether by trying for the subject of my choice,” she said. Anusuya Samaddar from Ramakrishna Vivekananda Mission Barrackpore also got over 90% marks and applied for geology, physics and economics in 20 colleges. But almost everywhere, her rank is below 400. “I’ve got a chance for online reporting in Ashutosh College as my rank is 323 and they have called up to 330. But, for the first round, only 40-41 have been called. So I have a long wait ahead,” she said. College principals requested students and parents to be patient. “This year, the cut-off percentage is very high. Students who have gotten very high marks have applied to nearly all good colleges. They will figure on the first list in multiple institutions. So, those who have missed out will have to wait to see how many seats remain vacant to get an opportunity,” explained Lady Brabourne principal Siuli Sarkar. Her counterpart in Scottish Church College, Madhumanjari Mandal Choubey, concurred. “Too many students have got very high marks this year. Many will initially be disappointed. But a clearer picture will emerge after a few days,” she said. Students who are eyeing Presidency University, Jadavpur University, Lady Brabourne College, Maulana Azad College and Asutosh College are worried about the limited seats at these institutions, which may get filled up before their turns come. For now though, there is little they can do but keep their fingers crossed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/90-plus-in-boards-but-still-facing-admission-jitters/articleshow/85850994.cms||---
---||Kolkata||BJP eyes ‘deprivation’ plank to secure N Bengal base||Siliguri: The Bengal BJP, having a majority presence in north Bengal, has started building the “deprivation” narrative against the Trinamool government just as the state was stepping up the ante against the Narendra Modi-led Centre. The BJP narrative has at its core the “neglect towards development” in north Bengal and also the initiation of tripartite talks between the Centre, state and stakeholders of the Gorkhaland agitation that Gorkha leaders Binoy Tamang and Anit Thapa had been demanding before they went with ruling Trinamool. BJP national spokesperson and Darjeeling MP Raju Bista and junior Union minister John Barla held a meeting with 24 MPs and MLAs in Siliguri on Wednesday to “reflect public sentiments”. Bista said the Bengal CM should participate in tripartite talks in the interests of Gorkhas and people in the Terai-Dooars region. “It will be appropriate for the CM to participate in the talks. Union home minister Amit Shah also wants the CM in the talks,” Bista said. BJP’s Siliguri MLA Sankar Ghosh was present in the meeting. Bista also went with “public sentiment” in making north Bengal a separate province. “The people of the region want a separate state following the atrocities of the ruling Trinamool. The Constitution gives people the right to press their demands. We are not under the Taliban in Afghanistan and I do not have problems with their demands, and whenever required, if a situation calls, we will stand with the people,” he said. The MP came down heavily on the state government for opposing the Centre’s decision to include Darjeeling Himalayan Railways (DHR) in the National Monetisation Pipeline. “The Centre is not selling out DHR like the Trinamool government did. West Bengal Tea Development Corporation had five gardens – three in Darjeeling and two in Dooars. They have sold to private takers,” Bista said. Barla, however, parried questions on the statehood demand. “We have come here to discuss development of north Bengal and plan for the coming civic polls and Siliguri Mahakuma Parshad elections,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bjp-eyes-deprivation-plank-to-secure-n-bengal-base/articleshow/85849757.cms||Roshan Gupta

TMC: Why protect BJP’s Suvendu Adhikari?||KOLKATA: The Enforcement Directorate on Wednesday filed money-laundering charges in the 2016 Narada sting tape case against state ministers Firhad Hakim and Subrata Mukherjee, MLA Madan Mitra, former MLA Sovan Chatterjee and former police officer SMH Meerza. A special court took cognisance of ED’s report on Wednesday, three-and-a-half months after CBI filed its charge sheet in the case, and asked them to be present in court on November 16. But it asked the ED to issue summons to Hakim, Mukherjee and Mitra through the Bengal assembly speaker as they were MLAs. The developments prompted the Trinamool Congress to ask why the ED had spared Bengal BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari. “Whether the accused have committed any crime or not is a matter of investigation. But why didn’t the ED mention Adhikari’s name in the charge sheet? Are they specifically naming Trinamool leaders or those who have distanced themselves from the BJP?” Trinamool spokesperson Kunal Ghosh asked. Ghosh said the CBI FIR mentioned BJP leader Adhikari’s name as an accused who was seen accepting money. “The CBI has sent a letter to Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla but he is yet to respond to that. It seems that BJP leaders are being protected,” he said. The CBI filed its charge sheet against the Trinamool seniors and former mayor Chatterjee on May 17 and arrested them though they were released on bail 11 days later by a five-judge Calcutta High Court bench. The ED, officials said, did not need a formal nod to file charges. “The judge has taken cognisance and has asked the accused persons to appear in court on November 16,” the ED’s lawyer, Abhijit Bhadra, said. The ED has has also filed a separate petition to continue further investigations against MLAs Adhikari and Mukul Roy and MPs Saugata Roy, Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar, Prasun Banerjee and Aparupa Poddar and former MLA Iqbal Ahmed. The sting operation, conducted by Mathew Samuel on 12 Trinamool Congress leaders and an IPS officer between 2014 and 2016, was made public before the 2016 assembly poll.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ed-files-charges-in-narada-case-tmc-why-protect-bjps-suvendu/articleshow/85850686.cms||Subrata Chattoraj
