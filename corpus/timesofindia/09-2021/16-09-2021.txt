---||Bengaluru||60,000 kms on a cycle is not uncommon for these Bengalureans||Recently, Bengaluru’s endurance cyclists met to celebrate 100 years of randonneuring. How? By going on a 200-kilometer ride from Bengaluru to Chikkaballapur and back, of course! Close to 400 cyclists participated in the event, and many have ridden over 10,000 kilometres on their bikes, developing a strong bond with their bikes in this process. Bengaluru is one of the first randonneuring city in IndiaFifty-year-old long-distance, ultra-endurance cyclist Mohan Subramanyam, who is also the representative of the Bangalore Randonneurs Cycling Group, has clocked one lakh kilometers of cycling, including randonneuring, since 2013. He explains what randonneuring is. “It is long-distance endurance cycling, with rides of 200 kms, 300 kms, 400 kms, 600 kms and 1,000 kms — called Brevets de Randonneurs Mondiaux (BRM). BRMs have been conducted in Bengaluru for the last 10 years and it is one of the first cities in the country to organise long-distance endurance cycling events. The randonneuring community here has grown 10 times in the last 3-4 years, with 750 active current members,” he says. Cycle becomes life coach for manyRandonneuring involves riding on tortuous terrains and that comes with challenges, which cyclists feel are more rewarding than painful. “Apart from the opportunity to visit scenic locations and make new friends, riding on higher elevations has taught me to challenge myself and approach problems in a much structured way,” says Raghu Nandan Nagaraja, who has cycled 62,000 kilometers. For Grinshina Kartik, the sport has helped her get over her fears and challenge social conditioning. “Being a randonneur is all about learning to be self-sufficient as a rider. Personally, randonneuring opened up a world where I could not only challenge myself by taking on unimaginable long-distance rides, but also learn to deal with my innate fears and the conditioning of being told not to ride alone as a woman. Being able to fix punctures and basic mechanical issues on your own and continue to ride builds confidence,” says Grinshina, who boasts of riding 40,000 kilometers on her bike — ‘Karma Chameleon’. Ashok Tiruvengadam, who has ridden 62,000 kilometers, says that it is not just about the two wheels of the cycle, but bonding with people and nature. “That is what randonneuring is all about. I discovered that the bond only grows stronger as time progresses. It has also helped me connect with myself,” he says. Joining the randonneuring tribe... It goes without saying that one can’t become a randonneur overnight. You have to make fitness a priority and approach it holistically, suggests Mohan. “If you want to become a randonneur, then you need to cycle for at least two hours everyday. This not just helps you stay healthy and fit, but trains you for long-distance cycling, and helps in consistency and maintaining rhythm. Apart from cycling, it is important to build one's core strength and train mentally for multi-day long-distance endurance rides. Of course, eating and hydrating well during the ride and after for proper recovery is very important," says Mohan. For those who are considering becoming long-distance riders, Grinshina suggests starting slow, enjoying your rides and then slowly building your endurance. “Build your base mileage cautiously or you will end up doing too much, leading to burn out. Recovery days are critical to high performance, so never do non-stop riding everyday as part of training. Take at least one entire day off without any workout. Strength and flexibility training is important to stay free from injuries," she advises. BOX What is randonneuring? Randonneuring is cycling 200-plus kilometers at a speed of 15/kmph; this distance can go up to 1,000 kilometers, but within a certain time limit. The challenge in randonneuring is endurance — both physical and mental. Participation in randonneuring events is part of a long tradition that goes back to the beginning of the sport of cycling in France and Italy. Is randonneuring for you? Do you regularly ride 25 kms-50 kms? Then, you can try the 200 kms Brevets de Randonneurs Mondiaux. With disciplined training, you can try out long-distance endurance cycling.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/60000-kms-on-a-cycle-is-not-uncommon-for-these-bengalureans/articleshow/86228099.cms||Joyeeta Chakravorty

According to a Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report tabled in the assembly on Wednesday, the Palike is yet to remove 714 encroachments on SWDs across the city though they were identified eight years ago. This was revealed in the performance audit of stormwater management in Bengaluru Urban area. Following a direction from the high court in 2011, BBMP identified 2,626 encroachments on SWDs, of which 1,912 have been removed so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/cag-report-palike-yet-to-clear-714-encroachments-on-swds/articleshow/86242628.cms||---

It’s not because of a new flying adventure, but the experience of having an ebullient 100-year-old as co-flyer for the day. The centenarian, who took to the Bengaluru skies was Ramudu Rongala from Nidadavole town in West Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh. Born on January 9, 1921, the freedom fighter arrived in Bengaluru on September 8 by air to visit his grandchildren residing in JP Nagar, not knowing his family had arranged a birthday surprise for him. “Thathaiah loves flying. Before coming here, he flew from Rajahmundry airport to Chennai to attend some work and from there, he took the flight to Bengaluru. When he was 96, he had flown to South Africa. So, five of his grandchildren decided to give him a flying surprise here,” said Arvind Rongala, one of his grandkids. The family drove the senior patriarch to the Jakkur aerodrome on Saturday morning on the pretext of a picnic. His joy knew no bounds when he spotted a Zenith Air 701 two-seater microlight aircraft. “He walked enthusiastically towards me and boarded the plane with ease. Never in my flying career have I witnessed such a senior man so eager and daring to take the flight. He is truly an inspiration and it was indeed an honour to fly him,” said Captain Audrey Maben who holds the honour of being India’s first woman microlight flight instructor. “It was a great feeling to see Bengaluru from the top and I hope to do it again,” a spirited Rongala said, after flying for 12 minutes. He even co-piloted the tiny aircraft during a bit of choppy weather with the guidance of Maben, who was awed by his age-defying alertness and swift manoeuvering in the cockpit. He returned to Nidadavole on Wednesday evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bday-gift-100-yr-old-becomes-co-pilot-for-a-day/articleshow/86242631.cms||Petlee Peter
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru boy scores 100 percentile in JEE Main||BENGALURU: Gaurab Das, a student of Narayana E-Techno School in Sahakar Nagar, has secured 100 percentile in the overall JEE (Main) – 2021 examination. Gaurab Das had secured a 99.85 percentile in his first attempt, 99.96 percentile in the second attempt and got 100 percentile in his third attempt. Gaurab is the only student from the state to have scored 100 NTA score in the exam. JEE main is being held four times this year. Eighteen students have bagged the No.1 ranking among the 44 who scored 100 percentile in four cycles. Gaurab has already joined computer engineering in Purdue University, the US. However, he said he will fly down to India in October to write the Advanced paper. “I have prepared for two years for JEE. JEE Advanced has always been the focus during the two years. I want to write the Advanced as it will give me a sense of satisfaction. However, I am not sure how well I will do or whether I’ll join an IIT if I crack it. It will depend on a lot of factors like the OCI rules and whether I like the university here,” he told TOI. Gaurab, who was a student of DPS Bangalore North till grade 10, moved to the US with his mother and twin sisters in August to join his father who is working there. “I like classes here. The exposure is good. I interacted with Garry Kasporav, the chess grandmaster, on Wednesday,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bluru-boy-scores-100-percentile-in-jee-main/articleshow/86242638.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Hold BBMP polls at the earliest, say citizens & activists||BENGALURU: Citizens, activists and former corporators on Wednesday demanded holding of elections for the BBMP, which has not had a council for one year now. They spoke at an event held by Janaagraha, a not-for-profit organisation. “The government wants to implement something unique for the city but I can’t see anything new in the BBMP Act, 2020. In fact, it is a cut-and-paste job of the KMC Act,” said Abdul Wajid, two-time Congress corporator from Manorayanapalya ward. Pointing out that the government is delaying elections citing delimitation, Wajid said the city would have suffered a little less had there been a council of corporators. “...A corporator plays a huge role in all the welfare schemes and minute developments in a ward. Without councillors, citizens are suffering. Local problems cannot be resolved,” he said. Srinivas Alavilli, head, civic participation, Janaagraha, said democracy loses its meaning when elections are not held in a timely manner. “...On International Democracy Day, all political parties, along with citizens, have questioned why there is a huge delay in conducting elections. Without the BBMP council, interests of the citizens cannot be protected. Forums like ward committees will not be meaningful without corporators who know their wards well. We appeal to the government to hold elections at the earliest,” he said. Usha Mohan, representing Aam Admi Party said the citizens of Bengaluru have lost their power to vote in local elections and that the concerns of citizens go unheard in the absence of corporators. Many former corporators pointed out that civilians reached out to them several times during the two waves of the pandemic that hit the city in the past two years.  BJP’s Swetha Vijaykumar, former corporator of Doddanekundi ward, said: “I’m not sure about the political reasons for the delay of elections, but can say that work was faster when wards had corporators. Several citizens reached out to me when there were issues regarding death certificates, medical bill reimbursements etc., during the second wave.” Citizens, political leaders and former corporators who participated in the conversation, demanded that the State Election Commission (SEC) follow due process established by the law and conduct the elections at the earliest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/hold-bbmp-polls-at-the-earliest-say-citizens-activists/articleshow/86242639.cms||---
---||World||FDA strikes neutral tone ahead of vaccine booster meeting||WASHINGTON: Influential government advisers will debate Friday if there’s enough proof that a booster dose of Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine is safe and effective — the first step toward deciding which Americans need one and when. The Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday posted much of the evidence its advisory panel will consider. The agency struck a decidedly neutral tone on the rationale for boosters — an unusual and careful approach that’s all the more striking after President Joe Biden and his top health advisers trumpeted a booster campaign they hoped to begin next week. Pfizer’s argument: While protection against severe disease is holding strong in the US, immunity against milder infection wanes somewhere around six to eight months after the second dose. The company gave an extra dose to 306 people at that point and recorded levels of virus-fighting antibodies threefold higher than after the earlier shots. More important, Pfizer said, those antibodies appear strong enough to handle the extra-contagious delta variant that is surging around the country. To bolster its case, Pfizer pointed the FDA to data from Israel, which began offering boosters over the summer. That study tracked about 1 million people 60 and older and found those who got the extra shot were far less likely to become infected soon afterward. In the documents posted by the FDA, Pfizer said that translates to “roughly 95% effectiveness” when delta was spreading, comparable to the protection seen shortly after the vaccine’s rollout earlier in the year. The FDA’s reviewers, however, suggested they would mainly look to research on how the vaccines are working among Americans, saying that “may most accurately represent vaccine effectiveness in the US population.” Overall, the data show that the Pfizer and other US-authorized Covid-19 vaccines “still afford protection against severe Covid-19 disease and death in the United States,” the agency said, summarizing the evidence. The FDA is not bound to follow the advice of its independent advisory panel. But if the agency overrules its own experts, that could stoke public confusion. Earlier this week, two top FDA vaccine regulators joined a group of international scientists in rejecting boosters now for otherwise healthy individuals, citing the strong continuing protection against severe disease. Dr. Anna Durbin of Johns Hopkins School of Public Health said it’s important to understand the FDA’s decision simply is whether an extra dose is safe and does what it promises — raise immunity levels. If the FDA decides the extra shot does those two things, then the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will debate who should get another dose. The CDC has signaled it is considering a booster for certain people — such as older adults, nursing home residents and front-line health workers — rather than the general population. The broader issue: “What really is going to control the delta variant is vaccinating the unvaccinated, not boosters,” Durbin said. More than one-third of Americans who are eligible for the shots aren’t yet fully vaccinated, according to CDC data. The US already offers an extra dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines to people with severely weakened immune systems. For the average person, what’s the evidence that immunity is waning? The CDC says real-world data show protection against severe illness, hospitalizations and deaths is holding strong. But in one recent study, protection against infection slipped as the delta variant hit: It was 91% in the spring but 78% in June and July. The CDC also has seen a hint that for people 75 and older, protection against hospitalizations slightly declined in the summer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/fda-strikes-neutral-tone-ahead-of-vaccine-booster-meeting/articleshow/86243027.cms||---
---||World||Controversy hits Saragarhi statue in Britain after Akal Takht jathedar visit||LONDON: The unveiling of the Saragarhi statue in Wolverhampton last weekend has been mired in controversy after one Sikh group criticised the attendance of the jathedar of the Akal Takht, Giani Harpreet Singh, who flew from India, as well as the design and cost of the memorial. The memorial commemorates the Battle of Saragarhi, which saw 21 soldiers from the 36th Sikh Regiment pitted against thousands of Afghan tribesmen. It was commissioned by Wednesfield’s Guru Nanak Gurdwara. The Sikh Press Association, in an Instagram post, said: "Last month UK Sikh community figure Sukhjeevan Singh wrote an open letter criticising Harpreet Singh's attendance for the unveiling. Many believe the jathedar should only give official support to Sikh specific causes, thus not those fighting for the British crown. Furthermore, the jathedar is comparatively silent on current British Sikh issues, such as the #westmidlands3 trial and #FreeJaggiNow campaign." "Westmindlands3" refers to the extradition hearing next Wednesday at Westminster magistrates’ court of three British-born Sikh men, Gursharanvir Singh Wahiwala, Amritivir Singh Wahiwala and Piara Singh Gill, who live in the West Midlands, who India is seeking to extradite to face charges of conspiracy to a murder in India in 2009. The post also condemned the statue for the words "sooraa so pahichaanee-ai jo larai deen kay hayt purjaa purjaa kat marai kabhoo na chhaadai khayt" from the Guru Granth Sahib engraved on it beneath the feet of the statue of Havildar Ishar Singh, who led the 21 Sikh soldiers. "Gurbani (Guru’s words) is mandated to be revered as the gurus themselves, thus barring it being put on anything that won’t be kept protected and treated respectfully at all times," the Sikh Press Association Instagram post said. "Finally, many have criticised the cost of the statue, with £100,000 (Rs 1 crore) of local gurdwara money being used for it. Many feel this money could be better spent by the Sikh community, especially in consideration of the Sikh practice of seva (service) and current global issues," the post said. The gurdwara congregation raised £100,000 for the monument and the City of Wolverhampton Council contributed £35,000 (Rs 35 lakh) after it agreed to transfer land to the gurdwara on a 99-year lease. Wolverhampton city councillor Bhupinder Gakhal, who worked closely with Guru Nanak Gurdwara to develop the memorial, apologised for the Gurbani text on the statue. He said: "We have covered up those words and we will take the slab out and put in a new slab with those words left out so there will be no Gurbani text on it. When this was brought to our attention on Sunday evening, we immediately said we have made a terrible mistake and sent out a video apologising. We were very honoured to have the jathedar of the Akal Takht attend the unveiling. These were Sikh soldiers who were defeated at the Saragarhi outpost who sacrificed their lives and we are commemorating their bravery, along with all the other Sikh soldiers who fought in both world wars." With regards to the criticism that the jathedar was "comparatively silent on British Sikh issues" such as the extradition case brought by India against three British Sikh men and the ongoing incarceration of Scottish Sikh Jagtar Singh Johal in an Indian jail," Gakhal said: "The jathedar was invited to meet West Midlands Police at Lloyd House in Birmingham, and if he had attended he could have raised his concerns about these issues. But these very people said the jathedar should not go to Lloyd House or speak with the police so he decided he did not want to upset the Sikh community." And regarding the cost, he said: "We feel these 21 soldiers deserve everything and we feel that is a very small contribution, what we have done, and they have got worldwide fame and everyone will now know the history of Saragarhi."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/controversy-hits-saragarhi-statue-in-britain-after-akal-takht-jathedar-visit/articleshow/86243491.cms||NAOMI CANTON
---||World||US to spend $470 million to learn more about long Covid-19||WASHINGTON: The US government will spend $470 million to learn more about long Covid-19, its causes and potential treatments. The National Institutes of Health announced the plans Wednesday with a grant awarded to New York University and a goal of enrolling up to 40,000 adults and children nationwide. The effort, dubbed RECOVER, will involve researchers at more than 30 US institutions. ’’This is being taken with the greatest seriousness… at a scale that has not really been attempted with something like this,” Dr. Francis Collins, NIH director, said at a briefing Wednesday. Collins says its estimated 10% to 30% of people infected with Covid-19 may develop persistent, new or recurring symptoms that can last months or perhaps years. Long Covid is an umbrella term for symptoms that linger, recur and show up for the first time four weeks or more after an initial infection. It also includes heart inflammation and multisystem inflammatory syndrome, a rare but serious condition that can occur in children after a Covid-19 infection. Pain, headaches, fatigue, brain fog, shortness of breath, anxiety, depression, chronic coughs and sleep problems are among the reported symptoms of long Covid. Possible causes include the virus lingers in tissues and organs or it overstimulates the immune system.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-to-spend-470-million-to-learn-more-about-long-covid-19/articleshow/86245414.cms||---

It’s the first chartered passenger flight for Elon Musk’s SpaceX and a big step in space tourism by a private company. “It blows me away, honestly,” SpaceX director Benji Reed said on the eve of launch from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center. “It gives me goose bumps even right now to talk about it.” The Pennsylvania entrepreneur who is picking up the tab — Jared Isaacman — won’t say how much he paid. He and his fellow passengers will spend three days orbiting Earth at an unusually high altitude of 357 miles (575 kilometers) — 100 miles (160 kilometers) higher than the International Space Station — before splashing down off the Florida coast this weekend. In July, Virgin Galactic’s Richard Branson and Blue Origin’s Jeff Bezos launched aboard their own rockets to spur ticket sales. Their flights barely skimmed space, though, and lasted just minutes. Isaacman and the others — St. Jude physician assistant Hayley Arceneaux and sweepstake winners Chris Sembroski, a data engineer, and Sian Proctor, a community college educator — said on the eve of launch that they had few if any last-minute jitters. It will be the first time in 60 years of human spaceflight that no professional astronaut is aboard an orbit-bound rocket. Their fully automated capsule has already been to orbit: It was used for SpaceX’s second astronaut flight for NASA to the space station. The only significant change to the capsule, according to Reed, is the large domed window at the top in place of the usual space station docking mechanisms. Isaacman — founder of a payment-processing company and an accomplished pilot — said Musk has assured him “the entire leadership team is solely focused on this mission and is very confident.” He added: “That obviously inspires a lot of confidence in us as well.” Musk flew in for the launch, as did hundreds of SpaceX workers and representatives of St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. Isaacman is using the flight to try to raise $200 million for St. Jude, half of that coming from his own pockets. While NASA has no role in the flight, its managers and astronauts are rooting for the flight, dubbed Inspiration4. “To me, the more people involved in it, whether private or government, the better, ” said NASA astronaut Shane Kimbrough, who is nearing the end of his six-month space station stay.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/spacex-aiming-for-night-launch-of-4-on-1st-private-flight/articleshow/86245625.cms||---
---||World||States learning how many Afghan evacuees coming their way||WASHINGTON: The Biden administration on Wednesday began notifying governors and state refugee coordinators across the country about how many Afghan evacuees from among the first group of nearly 37,000 arrivals are slated to be resettled in their states. California is projected to take more arrivals than any other — more than 5,200 people, according to State Department data for the Afghan Placement and Assistance program. Alabama and Mississippi are each slated to welcome 10, according to US officials. Hawaii, South Dakota, West Virginia, Wyoming and the District of Columbia are not expected to resettle anyone from the first group of evacuees who fled during the final days of the chaotic US withdrawal last month. The administration has requested funding from Congress to help resettle 65,000 Afghans in the United States by the end of this month and 95,000 by September 2022. President Joe Biden tapped the former governor of his home state of Delaware, Jack Markell, to temporarily serve as his point person on resettling Afghan evacuees in the United States. States with a historically large number of Afghans who resettled in the US over the last 20 years — including California, Maryland, Texas and Virginia — are again welcoming a disproportionate number of evacuees, according to the data. Many gravitate to northern Virginia, the Maryland suburbs of D.C. and northern California — some of the most expensive housing markets in the country. Many of the new evacuees requested to be resettled in those states because they already have family and close friends living in those states, according to two US officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the calls to state government officials. Resettlement agencies also have a large presence and capacity in many of those states. The State Department resettled evacuees based on the advice of local affiliates of nine national resettlement agencies the US government is working with, the officials said. The officials said Afghan evacuees are advised that other parts of the country -- including areas with plentiful job openings and cheaper housing -- could be good places to begin their new lives in the US The Afghan evacuees go through a Department of Homeland Security-coordinated process of security vetting before being admitted. And every evacuee who comes into the United States also goes through health screening. Evacuees who are 12 and older are required to get the Covid-19 vaccination as a term of their humanitarian parolee status after entering the country. Still, there have been unexpected complications. US-bound flights for evacuees who had been staying temporarily in third-country processing sites were halted last week after measles cases were discovered among several Afghans who had recently arrived in the US Some of the recent Afghan arrivals could also face a tough road ahead if Congress doesn’t take action to treat them as refugees arriving in the U.S. The Afghan evacuees are not currently eligible for food stamps, cash assistance through the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program for low income families, Medicaid or other traditional refugee services that are funded through the Department of Health and Human Services. Currently, each Afghan evacuee is slated to get a one-time direct payment of $1,225. Biden has called on Congress to take action to ensure that the recent arrivals have access to the same benefits as refugees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/states-learning-how-many-afghan-evacuees-coming-their-way/articleshow/86246584.cms||---
---||World||Moderna says Covid-19 vaccine protection wanes, makes case for booster||CHICAGO: New data from Moderna Inc's large Covid-19 vaccine trial shows that the protection it offers declines over time, supporting the case for booster doses, the company said in a news release on Wednesday. Several recent studies have suggested that its vaccine may have an edge over a similar shot from Pfizer Inc and German partner BioNTech SE in terms of maintaining efficacy over time. Experts said the difference is likely due to Moderna's higher dose of messenger RNA (mRNA) and the slightly longer interval between the first and second shots. Both vaccines proved to be exceedingly effective at preventing illness in their large Phase III studies. The analysis released on Wednesday, however, showed a chink in the Moderna shot's armor over time, with higher rates of infection among people vaccinated roughly 13 months ago compared with those vaccinated roughly eight months ago. The study has yet to undergo peer review. Moderna on Sept. 1 submitted its application to the US Food and Drug Administration seeking authorization for a booster shot. Briefing documents from the FDA's analysis of Pfizer's booster application, released earlier on Wednesday, suggest that a key issue the agency will consider is whether vaccine protection is waning. Previous data on Moderna's shot had shown lasting protection, making the case for boosters more challenging. In the new analysis, Moderna compared the vaccine's performance in more than 14,000 volunteers vaccinated between July and October of 2020 to some 11,000 volunteers originally in the placebo group who were offered the shot between December 2020 and March 2022 following its US emergency use authorization. They identified 88 Covid-19 cases among those who got the two shots more recently, compared with 162 cases among those vaccinated last year. Overall, however, only 19 cases were considered severe, a key benchmark in assessing waning protection. Moderna said there was a trend toward a lower rate of severe cases among the more recently vaccinated, although the finding was not statistically significant. The company said the waning immunity seen in the new analysis adds to evidence that a booster is needed. The company also highlighted two studies showing long-lasting protection against severe disease. In a study conducted with Kaiser Permanente Southern California while the highly transmissible Delta variant was circulating, researchers found the Moderna vaccine was 87% effective at preventing a Covid-19 diagnosis, and 96% effective at preventing hospitalization. They had analyzed data on more than 352,000 people who got two doses of the Moderna vaccine compared with the same number of unvaccinated individuals with similar ages and risk factors. Moderna also highlighted a study published last week by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention looking at data from more than 32,000 visits to urgent care centers, emergency rooms and hospitals in nine states or major cities. It found that Moderna's vaccine was 95% effective at preventing hospitalization among individuals of all ages compared with 80% for the Pfizer/BioNTech shot and 60% for the vaccine from Johnson & Johnson.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/moderna-says-covid-19-vaccine-protection-wanes-makes-case-for-booster/articleshow/86246746.cms||---

A fact-finding team of BJP will soon visit Balrampur to meet the families. Addressing a press conference, Singh alleged that the deaths took place in Ramchandrapur area. BJP leader Ramvichar Netam said that Bhupesh Baghel-led Congress was silent even after the deaths and has crossed all limits of its incompetence and insensitivity. The government claims that the rate of malnutrition has come down in the state, but the reality is in front of everyone. Actually, the government is not worried about tribals, added Netam. BJP will celebrate Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s birthday on September 17 by sending 11 lakh postcards with a message of greeting and hailing his efforts towards development of Chhattisgarh. Besides BJP Yuva Morcha has taken the responsibility of installing NaMo app in five lakh smartphones. Referring to the programs of Seva and Samarpan Abhiyan, former chief minister Raman Singh said that from September 17 to October 7, bags would be distributed to the beneficiaries of Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana. For this, 3 lakh bags have been ordered embossed with a photo of the Prime Minister on the bag. Hitting back , Congress Spokesperson Shailesh Nitin Trivedi said,"Raman Singh has no moral right to point finger at Baghel-led Congress government over malnutrition issue because the government is already working on addressing the issue, which was left untouched by the erstwhile Raman Singh-led BJP government. Unlike BJP’s duplicity of neither working, nor letting anyone work, the state government has already attained success in reducing malnutrition in Tribal districts."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/raipur/bjp-fact-finding-team-to-visit-balrampur-over-tribal-deaths/articleshow/86237692.cms||---

The main accused is Stalin, a resident of Old Bagaluru Layout near KG Halli and a rowdy-sheeter in KG Halli police station limits. His associates Louis Jack, Arun Kumar and Vijay Kumar are residents of New Bagaluru. According to police, one suspect is still at large. On Sunday, the gang of five, including two who were wearing helmets, surrounded Aravind at a BBMP playground where a ‘6-a-side’ football tournament was on. Aravind rushed to the KSFA football stadium and locked himself inside the referee’s room. The accused broke open the door and allegedly hacked him to death using machetes and other weapons. The incident created panic as it took place in full public view a few minutes before a women’s football match was to begin. It was later cancelled. Probe revealed Stalin and his gang murdered Aravind to avenge the assault on Subhash, Stalin’s younger brother, at KG Halli in April. MN Anucheth, deputy commissioner of police (central), formed two separate teams to trace and nab the suspects. A team headed by Ashoknagar police inspector Mallesh Bolettin identified the assailants as Stalin and his associates after verifying CCTV footage at the football ground. According to police, Aravind allegedly attacked and harassed people close to Stalin. He had reportedly assaulted Vijay and Jack’s wives a few months ago. Hence, the duo readily joined hands with Stalin to eliminate Aravind.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/four-arrested-for-rowdys-murder-in-football-stadium/articleshow/86247232.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: SWR begins probe after train passes open railway crossing||BENGALURU: South Western Railway (SWR) has begun probe into an incident in which a train carrying ballast passed an open level-crossing gate at Yelahanka on Sunday. Level-crossing gates are kept closed during train movement to prevent vehicles from crossing the tracks. Sources said a major tragedy was averted on Yelahanka-Bangarpet section around 1pm on Sunday, thanks to an alert loco pilot and motorists near the railway- crossing gate. The loco pilot kept honking and then slowed down and stopped the train well past the level-crossing, while some motorists near the gate alerted others about the approaching train. A video of the incident shot by a motorist went viral on social media. Many blamed the gateman and railway officials for the negligence. However, SWR officials said the airport rail section is closed as there are no train movements and, hence, a gateman wasn’t posted there. “We will post a gateman once train movements are restored," said an official. “If gone unnoticed, it would have led to a major accident. Considering the level-crossing was open, motorists would have driven through without noticing the train. This could have led to a collision. Action should be initiated against the erring officials,” said a motorist in the area. SWR chief public relations officer Aneesh Hegde said: “This is Yelahanka-Bangarpet section via Kolar. Trains are not running in this section (both passenger, goods trains), except maintenance machines and ballast trains. It was a ballast train. The one-off incident is being probed in detail by senior officers.” However, another railway official said: “There are different aspects to this. It could be a human error or a technical issue. Ideally, the train should have stopped before the level-crossing, but it moved a little further and stopped after the loco pilot applied emergency brake. Now, train movement on this route has reduced due to lesser traffic after Covid-19, so a gateman may not have been deployed there. Only a thorough investigation will tell.” When it is an interlocked gate, the signal doesn’t turn green if the gate is open. However, this particular one was a not an interlocked one.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/swr-begins-probe-after-train-passes-open-railway-crossing/articleshow/86247235.cms||Christin Mathew Philip

At a session titled, ‘Enabling Safer Streets for Bengaluru’ at World Resources Institute (WRI) India’s event — Connect Karo 2021 — V Manjula, commissioner, Directorate of Urban Land Transport (DULT), said: “We have to strive to design for non-motorised transport users. DULT is working on an ‘Active Mobility Act’, which gives pedestrians and cyclists the right to complete and connected networks. It puts the onus on local bodies to provide infrastructure and has provisions for ‘mobility wardens’ from among the public, who can give suggestions for improvements....” In Singapore, AMA promotes walking and cycling and patronage of public transport. Reckless riding, speeding, riding of non-compliant devices and others attract hefty fines and jail term. AMA includes bicycles, power-assisted bicycles, motorised and non-motorised personal mobility devices (kick-scooters, electric scooters, hoverboards, unicycles, etc) and personal mobility aids (wheelchairs, motorised wheelchairs or mobility scooters.) “We are working towards promoting walking and cycling in the city. We are undertaking junction improvements and blackspot mitigation projects. The number of deaths on city roads is not a welcome sign and we would want to work with organisations to make our streets safer, especially for children,” said Gaurav Gupta, BBMP chief commissioner. “BBMP has developed more than 150km of footpaths. We are working on another 58km under the Smart City challenge. We are working with police to identify potholes. In each 198 wards, we will construct 5km of footpaths. We have undertaken 45 junction improvement projects,” said BS Prahalad, chief engineer (roads and infrastructure), BBMP. “...Our priorities must change from designing for cars to designing for people. This will make our streets more inclusive and accident-free,” said Akhila Suri, manager (Sustainable Cities and Transport), WRI India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/like-singapore-bengaluru-to-focus-on-safer-sharing-of-public-paths/articleshow/86247248.cms||---
---||India||India is looking to raise new ‘rocket force’ for missiles, says Gen Bipin Rawat||NEW DELHI: Warning that China is becoming very aggressive, and would soon step into Afghanistan after friendly overtures to Iran and Turkey, General Bipin Rawat on Wednesday said India needs an integrated national security architecture to deal with two hostile neighbours, non-contact technological warfare and internal security challenges. Taking recourse to Samuel Huntington’s seminal thesis ‘Clash of Civilizations’ during a talk at the India International Centre, the chief of defence staff said it mentions that the Confucian or `Sinic’ civilization would actually join hands with the Islamic civilization to counter the western one. “Whether that is going to happen or not, only time will tell. But we are seeing some kind of `jointmanship’ between the Sinic and Islamic civilizations. You can see China is now making friends with Iran, moving towards Turkey and stepping into Afghanistan. They (China) will step into Afghanistan in the time to come very shortly,” Gen Rawat said. Noting that the rise of China had happened faster than what the world has envisaged, India will have to wait-and-watch how events unfold in the Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. “We don’t know what is in the future. There can be more turmoil in Afghanistan and changes that can’t be anticipated as of now,” he added. Turning to Pakistan, the CDS said the western adversary will continue to fuel and expand its proxy war against India. “Today, we find it happening in J&K. They (Pakistan) are attempting it in Punjab once again, and are also trying to spread their wings in other parts of the country,” he said. “A weaker adversary like Pakistan will always keep us engaged through a proxy war. They are, in fact, a proxy of our northern adversary (China). China has shown aggression in the South China Sea with the nations in that area. Whether it happens in the form of direct aggression or use of technology along our land borders, we have to be prepared,” he added. India is adopting “a whole of government approach” to deal with all security issues. The country is looking to raise a new `rocket force’ for different kinds of missiles, ensure more `jointness’ between the armed forces and the central armed police forces, and create dual-use infrastructure and logistics through civil-military fusion, he said. Efforts are already underway to build an integrated war-fighting machinery through the creation of unified theatre commands, strengthening capabilities in the domains of space, cyberspace and special operations. With China becoming “more and more aggressive”, India also has to consider technology as a very important facet of war-fighting because an adversary will try to disrupt our strategic networks as well as energy, banking, transport and communication grids. “Future wars may not necessarily be fought like past wars, which were battles of attrition,” said Gen Rawat. Overall, India needs to start looking at “transforming” the national security architecture, which will require some kind of integration and jointness among all security forces as well as civilian organizations, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-is-looking-to-raise-new-rocket-force-for-missiles-says-gen-bipin-rawat/articleshow/86247245.cms||Rajat Pandit
---||World||Wolves may need protections after states expand hunting: US||BILLINGS: The Biden administration said Wednesday that federal protections may need to be restored for gray wolves in the western US after Republican-backed state laws made it much easier to kill the predators. The US Fish and Wildlife Service determination that the region’s wolves could again be in peril — after decades spent restoring them — will kick off a year-long biological review. It marks an abrupt turnaround for agency officials who spent years in court defending their decision under the Obama administration to allow wolves to be hunted and trapped under state jurisdiction in the six-state Northern Rockies region. Former President Donald Trump’s administration lifted protections across most of the rest of the US in his last days in office. Republican lawmakers in Montana and Idaho have been intent on culling more wolf packs, which are blamed for periodic attacks on livestock and reducing elk and deer herds that many hunters prize. The states’ Republican governors in recent months signed into law measures that expanded when, where and how wolves can be killed. That raised alarm among Democrats, former wildlife officials and advocacy groups that said increased hunting pressure could cut wolf numbers to unsustainable levels. The Humane Society of the US, the Center for Biological Diversity and other groups had filed legal petitions asking federal officials to intervene. The Fish and Wildlife Service said Wednesday that it had received “credible and substantial information that increased human-caused mortality in Idaho and Montana may pose a threat to wolves in those two States.” The agency rejected a request to restore protections immediately. But it said the groups provided enough information to justify a year-long review of whether wolves warrant re-listing under the Endangered Species Act, which is for plants and animals considered at risk of extinction. Center for Biological Diversity attorney Andrea Zaccardi said advocates welcomed the review but said wolves were “under the gun now” and need protections right away. “We are concerned that a lot of wolves could be wiped out while undertaking a year-long review,” she said. Wolves were exterminated across most of the US by the 1930s under government-sponsored poisoning and trapping campaigns. They were reintroduced from Canada into the Northern Rockies in the 1990s and expanded over the past two decades into parts of Oregon, Washington and California. Dozens of American Indian tribes asked the Biden administration on Tuesday to immediately enact emergency protections for gray wolves nationwide, saying states have become too aggressive in hunting the animals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/wolves-may-need-protections-after-states-expand-hunting-us/articleshow/86247323.cms||---

---||World||Harris, Yellen make a personal case for fixing child care||The US Treasury Department issued a report Wednesday that detailed the high price and low wages for child care, a problem that makes it harder for parents to work and one that the Biden administration aims to fix with its budget proposal. Vice President Kamala Harris and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen presented the findings in remarks that drew on personal experiences. Harris recalled spending weekdays with Regina Shelton, who ran a childcare center from her home while the vice president’s mother was in the lab researching breast cancer. “She became a second mother to my sister and me,” Harris said. “My mother often said that, but for Miss Shelton, she would not have been able to do the work that she did.” Yellen recalled posting a classified advertisement for a babysitter when she was returning to work 40 years ago as an economics professor after having given birth. Yellen and her husband, the economist George Akerlof, decided to pay wages above the market rate in order to receive better care. “It’s a completely rational reason to pay someone more, especially if the job is some of the most intimate work there is, which is caring for children,” Yellen said. “Our hypothesis proved correct, at least in our own home.” But Yellen emphasized that her experience is far from normal in the United States. The Treasury report draws attention to a troubling paradox in child care: It costs families too much money, yet the sector’s workers receive chronically low pay that undermines the quality of care. “Child care is a textbook case of a broken market,” Yellen said. An average family with just one child under 5 would need to devote 13% of their income for child care. That’s more than an average family spends on food and the report concludes that it’s an unaffordable sum. Child care workers earn an average of $24,230. More than 15% of the industry’s workers live below the poverty line in 41 states and half need public assistance. As a result, the sector has high levels of turnover with 26% to 40% leaving their job each year. Nor is their much room to give among child care centers that tend to operate on profits of 1% or less. The result is stressed parents, lower levels of women holding jobs and widening levels of inequality. The Biden administration says it can resolve these problems through a substantial increase in investment in young children. It would cap child care expenses at 7% of a family’s income. Universal pre-school for 3 and 4-year-olds would be provided. Families with children under 13 could receive dependent care tax credits of $4,000 per child or $8,000 for two or more children. The government would also fund child care centers to ensure workers can receive a living wage. Another key element would be the expanded child tax credit, which is providing families with children under the age of 6 with $300 a month per child and $250 monthly for older children. But some lawmakers are hesitant to provide the comparatively robust benefits being proposed by the administration. The president’s plan would remove work requirements for families receiving the child tax credit, something that West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a key Democratic vote for passage, opposes. “Tax credits are based around people that have tax liabilities,” Manchin told a reporter for Insider, a news outlet. “I’m even willing to go as long as they have a W-2 and showing they’re working.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/harris-yellen-make-a-personal-case-for-fixing-child-care/articleshow/86247398.cms||---
---||Guwahati||Assam: CPI’s Krishna pitted against his ex-client Dhaijjya Konwar from Raijor Dal||GUWAHATI: The emergence of lawyer Krishna Gogoi as the CPI candidate in the upcoming Thowra byelections against his former client Dhaijjya Konwar of Raijor Dal (RD) points to the state of the opposition unity in Assam. The Mahajot, led by the Congress, is still not decided on whom to take on board in its fight against the BJP. Krishna Gogoi is known in legal circles for his untiring efforts to free Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS) leader and RD president Akhil Gogoi, his deputy Dhaijjya and other anti-CAA activists lodged in jail under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) when the agitation against the new citizenship law took a violent turn in December 2019. After 18 months in jail when it seemed all roads to free Akhil were blocked, it was Gogoi and his team that the peasant body had faith in. Dhaijjya, the second most prominent leader of the KMSS, got bail in July 2020, a year before Akhil got bail. Krishna and his team were given the credit for Dhaijjya’s bail. The BJP's probable nominee is Sushanta Borgohain, but the Congress is yet to announce its candidate in Thowra, which is its stronghold. In the last assembly election, the CPI was a part of the Congress-led Mahajot. “The opposition disunity has compelled the CPI to announce the candidature from Thowra. We wanted opposition unity in this byelection but there was no serious intention in the Congress or the Raijor Dal to fight against fascim,” Krishna told TOI on Wednesday. He termed both the Congress and RD as paper tigers against BJP's 'fascist aggression' and accused both the opposition parties of only trying to fulfill their party agenda. Krishna said RD approached him multiple times asking him to step down. “Why doesn’t the Raijor Dal step down?” he asked instead. Dhaijjya and Krishna have shared very close relations in the past. They were hostel roommates when they studied at the Dispur Law College. “It's painful that I am contesting against my dear friend. Political parties are to be blamed for this clash,” Krishna added. He also accused the Congress of trying to supress smaller parties. Though CPI was in no mood to break away from the Mahajot, Krishna said the new Assam PCC president Bhupen Bora did nothing to strengthen the alliance. Though the CPI influence has declined in Sivasagar, dedicated cadres of the Left party are still leading the campaign silently. “If we get the votes of people who have principles, that's enough,” said Krishna. On the other hand, RD is focussing on street corner and courtyard meetings to reach out to maximum households. Dhaijjya said 30,000 votes may swing the pendulum in his favour in Thowra, which has 1.15 lakh registered voters. Most importantly, RD is expecting a big turnaround this time. Akhil’s victory in adjacent Sivasagar in the last election is expected to have a big impact in Thowra. The RD president has not attacked Krishna or CPI but went all out against Sushanta who joined BJP after stepping down as a Congress MLA recently. “The people have denounced Sushanta as a turncoat. He betrayed the voters who voted against the BJP in the last election,” said Akhil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/cpis-krishna-pitted-against-his-ex-client-dhaijjya-from-rd/articleshow/86239212.cms||Kangkan Kalita

Under the partnership, announced by President Joe Biden, British Prime Minster Boris Johnson and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, the United States will provide Australia with the technology and capability to deploy nuclear-powered submarines, senior US administration officials told reporters. The three leaders outlined the deal in a three-way virtual announcement from each of their capitals. "We all recognize the imperative of ensuring peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific for the long term," said Biden. Morrison said the submarines would be built in Adelaide in close cooperation with the United States and United Kingdom. Australia will not be fielding nuclear weapons, he said. "We will continue to meet all our nuclear non-proliferation obligations," he said. Johnson called it a momentous decision for Australia to acquire the technology. He said it would make the world safer. "This will be one of the most complex and technically demanding projects in the world," he said. The USofficials tressed that the move, which comes as Washington and its allies are looking for ways to push back against China's growing power and influence, would not involve provision of nuclear weapons to Australia. They said the submarines would not be deployed with atomic weaponry, but would allow the Australian navy to operate more quietly, for longer periods, and provide deterrence across the Indo-Pacific. The officials said the partnership, which will also involve cooperation in areas including artificial intelligence, quantum technology and cyber, was "not aimed at any one country." "This is a historic announcement. It reflects the Biden administration's determination to build stronger partnerships to sustain peace and stability across the entire Indo-Pacific region," one of the officials said. The partnership looks likely to end Australia's attempts to have French shipbuilder Naval Group build it a new submarine fleet worth $40 billion to replace its more than two-decades-old Collins submarines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/australia-to-get-us-nuclear-submarine-technology-as-china-looms-large/articleshow/86247635.cms||---

He also said that the Australian Space Agency will provide tracking services to Gaganyaan as it is “sprucing up its temporary ground station tracking facilities” for India’s space mission. Gaganyaan, originally scheduled for launch by 2022, was delayed due to the Covid pandemic. “We could have actually done this (launched Gaganyaan by 2022). We had planned to time it along the 75th anniversary of India’s Independence, but it could not happen that way because of the inevitable delay caused due to Covid-19. But I am sure, maybe by the end of next year or may be (by) the beginning of 2023, we would be able to do that as well,” the minister said at a webinar on ‘Future of India-Oceania Space Technology Partnerships’, organised as part of India Leads-2021 Summit by FICCI. Australia will use its ground station on the Cocos Keeling islands for tracking India’s manned spaceflight. The earth station will come in handy for smooth transfer of information on the status of gagannauts and the spaceship once it is in space as some time ‘blind spots’ occur, making it difficult for Isro to track satellites from its own stations. Singh said Australia and India have been partnering since 1987 to support data calibration and laser ranging for Indian satellites, launching Australian satellites, and conducting joint research. He said while Australia is a world leader in the use of remote sensing technologies, India and Oceania countries can collaborate by conducting regular training courses by several training institutions in both regions and share best practices with each other. The Union minister also said that Oceania countries such as New Zealand and Pacific island countries can collaborate with India and can jointly develop and identify space technological solutions and innovative products to explore partnerships and joint ventures. Singh said India is all set to become the hub for the small satellite launch market, which is estimated to be valued around $38 billion by 2027. Over the past few years, the space industry is emerging as one of the most lucrative industries globally and demand for nano, micro and mini satellites and re-usable and small satellite launch vehicle systems are anticipated to drive the market. He also said Isro has forged a strong relationship with many industrial enterprises, both in the public and private sector, to implement its space projects. With Isro undertaking the development of cutting-edge technologies and interplanetary exploratory missions, there is a tremendous scope in contributions to the realisation of operational missions and new areas such as satellite navigation, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/gaganyaan-launch-likely-by-2022-end-or-early-2023-australia-to-provide-tracking-services-space-minister/articleshow/86247682.cms||Surendra Singh

Considering the huge demand for the second dose and also the pending first dose, the state health department has proposed to observe the mega vaccination day on September 17, which the government said is ‘incidentally the birthday of the Prime Minister’. “We do have the potential capability to vaccinate up to 8 lakh people in a day, provided we make detailed micro-plan and efficiently execute the same in all the CVCs (Covid vaccination centres). With the active cooperation of the people, Assam has been steadfastly ensuring public safety from Covid through planned and coordinated vaccination campaigns,” said Lakshmanan S, Assam NHM director. The health department officials said considering vaccine availability, Assam can vaccinate a maximum of 4.75 lakh beneficiaries in a single day but the health department has set an even bigger target. As of September 10, Assam has completed 1.97 crore vaccination, with 1.61 crore first dose and 36 lakh second dose. During the last mega vaccination campaign from June 21 to 23, around 9.75 lakh people in Assam were vaccinated, most of whom are due for their second dose from September 14 onwards (84 days for Covishield). In order to achieve the target of 8 lakh, all districts have been asked to set up a minimum 4,000 CVCs across the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/assam-mega-vax-drive-to-mark-pm-bday-tomorrow/articleshow/86240179.cms||Kangkan Kalita

While police claimed that Jamal Hossen (35) of Kalapania village died of cardiac arrest, his family alleged he was murdered in Sonamura police station. Soures said Jamal complained of chest pain when the police had come to arrest him on charges of robbery and drug peddling on getting information that he was at home. Sepahijala superintendent of police Krishnendu Chakravorty said, “Jamal was wanted for a robbery case in 2009 and a drug peddling case in 2016. But he was absconding for long. Based on the information that he was at home, police raided the house and arrested him.” He claimed the the police station was under CCTV surveillance and so far no evidence of custody torture has been found. Moreover, the body does not have any external injury mark. “But the allegations will be seriously investigated,” he said. The police claimed that he may have suffered from sudden cardiac arrest, as he was being taken to hospital following his complaint of chest pain. Doctors sent him back to custody after medication. However, Jamal’s family alleged that he did not have any history of illness and was murdered by police in custody. In the morning, he was found lying on the floor of the lock-up and unresponsive. Immediately, he was taken to hospital where the doctors declared him dead, officer in-charge of Sonamura police station Nandan Das claimed. The victim’s sister, Ajufa Khatun, alleged that her brother was killed in custody, as he refused to go to the police station at night. “My brother worked in Dubai and came home two two months ago. He was supposed to go back on September 22. Police suddenly stormed our house referring to cases of burglary in 2009 and drug smuggling in 2016 and assaulted him in front of us,” Ajufa alleged. The CPM has demanded an impartial inquiry into the incident and booked the cops immediately, as the circumstances of the event clearly indicated that Jamal died of torture in police custody. The TMC demanded an inquiry by a sitting high court judge, as the incident has a new dimension of reign terror in the village.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agartala/hrs-after-arrest-tripura-man-dies-in-cop-custody/articleshow/86240153.cms||Biswendu Bhattacharjee

The MLA from Mawlai pleaded with the Speaker that time be given for discussing the issue raised by him pertaining to suspension of police officers involved in the killing of former Hynniewtrep National Liberation Council militant leader Cherishterfield Thangkhiew at Mawlai Kynton Massar on August 13. In fact, the Speaker had admitted and fixed the short duration discussion, but disallowed it after he received a letter from the state government referring to the opinion of the Advocate General that the matter is sub-judice. The Congress legislators staged a walkout after the Speaker refused to reconsider his ruling despite their plea that they would confine their discussion only on the demand for suspension of police officials involved in the killing of the former militant leader.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shillong/meghalaya-cong-walkout-over-cop-suspension-talks/articleshow/86240190.cms||Manosh Das

With only two weeks for colleges to reopen for first-year students, universities and colleges have to walk a tightrope to get ready for implementation of the National Education Policy-2020. The government had formed around 35 sub-committees to draw up the model syllabus for various subjects. While the official last date to submit the syllabus was on September 6, many committees submitted the report by Tuesday and Wednesday. “The compiled curriculum of 30 subjects will be mailed to all universities by Wednesday night or Thursday. We have given instructions to the committees to share the curriculum with colleges and universities. So many of them already have a copy of it. The panels had also consulted various Boards of Studies for the same and they are, therefore, familiar with the model syllabus,” said Thimme Gowda B, vice-chairman of KSHEC. However, universities and autonomous colleges have a long way to go. “We have only submitted a blown-up syllabus. The BoS of each university will have to develop the full curriculum. This is where they can also make changes in the model and tweak it to their needs,” said a committee member. Some autonomous colleges said they will prepare only one semester’s syllabus now as time is limited. The universities will also have to develop regulations-- courses, teaching hours, pedagogy, majors and minors, assessment pattern etc. This has to be approved by the academic council and syndicate before being implemented before October 1. “We have a model regulation ready. If the universities need it, we'll provide the model one and they can tweak it according to their needs,” said Gowda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/colleges-await-nepmodel-curriculum/articleshow/86248030.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas

Kritika had joined as a team leader with a private firm in Mahadevapura on Monday. The two had been friends for nearly eight years. The accident happened at 9.20pm when Preetam, a quality control manager with a private firm on Sarjapur Road, parked the bike — Royal Enfield Bullet — on lay-by at Singasandra Junction. A Maruti Suzuki Baleno dashed into them from behind, tossing both off the expressway onto the surface road, around 40 feet below. Both died instantly, police said. Car driver P Nitish Reddy, 23, a BE student with a private college near Jayanagar and resident of Tirupalya village in Anekal, has been shifted to a private hospital. Kritika lived in a paying-guest accommodation in Sarjapur while Preetam stayed with his parents and elder brother in JP Nagar, VIII Stage. Preetam’s father Praveen Kumar is a general manager with a private insurance firm. Both the bodies were handed to the families on Wednesday after postmortem at St John’s Hospital on Hosur Road.  Preetam had borrowed the vehicle from his friend. His family members told cops that he had called saying he had finished dinner outside and would be returning late. “They had parked the bike for some 20 seconds and were standing near it when the car hit them,” an officer said. Joint commissioner of police (traffic) BR Ravikante Gowda said: “We’ve sent the blood samples of Reddy to the Forensic Science Laboratory to check whether he was under the influence of alcohol or any drug. The car was moving at a speed of at least 100kmph. Every day, we’re penalising speeding vehicles on this expressway where the permitted speed is between 60 and 80kmph.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/woman-friend-were-out-to-celebrate-her-new-job/articleshow/86242652.cms||---

Many from outside villages are not willing to marry into families in H Rampur, RD Bindu pointed out, since it is a backbreaking ride and there is no bus service either. “There is no good connectivity to our village,” said Bindu, explaining that the 2km stretch of mud road from Hedne village has not been upgraded for years. The chief secretary assured the problem would be resolvedHer appeal on video to the government has gone viral and her letter to CM Basavaraj Bommai has drawn a response from the chief secretary. The chief secretary assured the problem would be resolved. Our elected representatives say it will take at least six months to restore the road. I have decided not to marry until then,” said Bindu, who is a postgraduate in economics and teaches at a private school in Kudalasangam, Bagalkot. “The road has to be tarred. It is riddled with potholes, slippery and slushy during rain. Many motorists suffered injuries after they fell off their bikes due to potholes. People of our village have to walk 5-7km up to Nayakonda to catch buses to reach the city, be it for work or to go to school/college,” she said.“My daughter is firm on her resolve not to marry till the road is developed,” said Latha Devendrappa, Bindu’s mother. “We have submitted memorandums to officials and elected representatives to repair this road, but to no avail,” said AK Ramesh, a resident. “There are many instances of marriages being cancelled due to lack of good road connectivity. There is no bus service in our village due to the bad road.” “We have already spent Rs 1-2 lakh for the development of this road but it is not enough. We need Rs 50 lakh to Rs 1 crore for tarring the road. We have requested the government and local MLA to sanction this amount,” said MR Siddappa, panchayat development officer, Mayakonda.

In the first two weeks of the month, the state has, on average, seen around 966 cases per day, compared to around 1,400 average daily infections in August — a dip of around 31%. In July, the state had seen around 8,000 cases a day, while the number stood at nearly 35,000 in May, when the second wave of infections was at its peak. However, six of the 14 days this month saw more than 1,000 cases, with the highest — 1,240 — so far being reported on September 2. Since then, cases have decreased, and the lowest number of fresh cases was reported on September 14 (559). Dr KV Trilok Chandra, health commissioner, said: “While the reduction in fresh cases is welcome, we will continue to remain vigilant and testing will remain high. Preparations, as per recommendations of the expert committee, are also underway for an anticipated third wave of infections.” The state has conducted more than 20.4 lakh tests this month and so far 13,522 cases have been reported. That puts the test positivity rate at 0.6%. A total of 211 deaths have been recorded during this period. Analysis of daily bulletins issued by the health department shows that monthly cases had dipped below 50,000 in August for the first time since March and at the current rate the state is likely to end September with under 30,000 cases. Karnataka had reported 44,321 cases in August compared to 61,314 in July, nearly 2.4 lakh in June, more than 10 lakh in May and around 5.2 lakh cases in April. Active cases still high:In the first two weeks of September, 15,941 people have recovered from Covid-19 and the number of active cases as of Wednesday morning was 15,754, which is around 14% lower than the number of patients under treatment as of August 31. However, Karnataka is still among the top five states in the country with the most patients under treatment. Kerala, with more than 1.9 lakh active cases, tops the list, while Maharashtra is second with 49,671 people under treatment.

The student, identified as T Soundharya, 17, from a village near Katpadi in Vellore district, hanged herself from a ceiling fan hook using her mother’s sari. She is the third student in the state to take the extreme step fearing failure in Neet, held across the country on Saturday, after Dhanush, 19, of Salem district and K Kanimozhi, 17, of Ariyalur district. "The girl might have committed suicide between 9.30am and 9.45am today (Wednesday). Her parents were working in a nearby farm. Her mother came home in the afternoon. She found the door locked and peeped through the window to find her daughter hanging from the ceiling. She raised the alarm and sought help," said DSP (Katpadi) P Palani. The DSP added that preliminary inquiries could not attribute any other reason for the girl ending her life than her poor performance in the test. "Based on preliminary investigation, we suspect that her fear over failure in Neet might have driven her to take the extreme step," Palani said. Soundharya, who completed Class XII in Vellore Thottapalayam Government Girls' Higher Secondary School, scored 510 out of maximum 600 marks in the board examination. She scored 381 out of 600 marks in plus one and 413 out of 500 marks in SSLC examinations. She appeared for Neet at a centre in a private engineering college in Katpadi on September 12. Her mother, T Rukmini, said she had been upset and sad for performing poorly in the test and had been depressed for the past two days. Rukmini and her husband, Thirunavukkarasu, are coolies working in agriculture fields. They left home for work on Wednesday morning. Soundharya's three elder sisters had gone out too. She was alone at home. When her parents returned home, they found her hanging from the ceiling. The Latheri police registered a case. The body was sent for post-mortem examination and police began an investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/yet-another-student-ends-life-over-neet/articleshow/86241712.cms||Bosco Dominique

The profile of cybercrimes registered in state in 2020 clearly shows that fraud (online banking frauds, OTP frauds, ATM and other frauds) was the motive in as many as 764 cases. A total of 375 cybercrimes against women were reported in the state in 2020 which include 145 crimes related to cyber stalking/bullying of women and children. Vizag city has reported a greater number of cybercrimes. Vizag city was followed by West Godavari and Kurnool districts in number of cases in 2020.

---||Business||Govt bails out telcos with 4-year gap in spectrum, AGR payouts||NEW DELHI: The Union Cabinet on Wednesday cleared a reform-oriented bailout package for the beleaguered telecom industry - freeing up cash for the financially stretched companies by throwing in a four-year moratorium on spectrum and AGR payments, while also slashing charges and offering a lenient definition of revenue recognition to hasten the transition towards 5G. The move, which was anticipated after Vodafone Idea appeared headed towards bankruptcy, will benefit all players, including Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio. It had been in the works for the past few months but was expedited as then Vodafone Idea chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla virtually threw in the towel amid mounting losses and heavy debt. was the first to report on the series of relief measures. Telecom minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said the "structural reforms" for the sector were revenue neutral - since interest will be charged post-moratorium - and have been approved to ensure sufficient competition in the sector. The government decided to remove non-telecom revenues from the AGR definition, which will save tax outgo on spectrum usage charge and licence fee in the future. It also cut the bank guarantee mandate against licence fee and other similar charges by 80% and said there will be no requirement for multiple bank guarantees in different service areas. The interest charged for delayed payments was also reduced, and penalties were removed. The measures are likely to leave sufficient cash in the hands of the industry to tide over their financial woes. The government has also kept the option to convert a portion of the interest burden into equity if the need arises at the end of the moratorium . And, to encourage the companies to move towards 5G, the government announced a series of positives which should make the industry migrate to the next-gen telecom technology. These include increasing the tenure of spectrum holdings by a significant 10 years -- raising it to 30 years from the existing 20 years. Surrender of spectrum will be permitted after 10 years for spectrum acquired in the future, while the government also said that it will not charge any SUC in the future. It also further liberalised foreign investment inflows in the sector, allowing 100% FDI under the automatic route. However, it remained cautious over investments coming in from China and countries that share a land border with India, saying they would be scrutinised.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/govt-bails-out-telcos-with-4-year-gap-in-spectrum-agr-payouts/articleshow/86248278.cms||Pankaj Doval
---||Ranchi||Durga Puja organisers in Ranchi want 5-feet height cap on idols lifted||RANCHI/JAMSHEDPUR: Durga Puja organizing committees in Ranchi on Wednesday unanimously resolved to meet chief minister Hemant Soren and urge him to remove height cap on idols. During a meeting on Tuesday, the state disaster management authority (SDMA) said that all idols have to be under 5ft. The Ranchi District Durga Puja Committee (RDDPC), the umbrella outfit for 165 puja committees here, met at Bakri Bazar in the evening. At the meeting, the RDDPC representatives agreed that due to very little time, it was not possible to alter with the sizes of Durga idols as most committees have already placed their respective orders with the idol-makers. They said that they could not wait for the SDMA’s guideline before placing the order as they were running out of time. RDDPC president Ashok Choudhary said: “A representation of Puja committees will soon meet the CM and urge him to reconsider the directive on the idols’ height.” The RDDPC, however, agreed to adhere to SDMA’s guidelines which said that pandals will not be based on any theme and be devoid of decorative lights and gates. “As per SDMA’s guideline, bhog will not be distributed among the devotees this year too, but it will be offered to the deities in keeping with the tradition,” the RDDPC said in a statement. Besides banning the entry of devotees, SDMA had also banned the organisation of fairs and food carts near the pandals in order to prevent overcrowding. While the RDDPC agreed to adhere to the guidelines, it went a step ahead and decided that they will ensure that the priests and the dhakis are vaccinated before taking part in the rituals which last four days. In Jamshedpur, the puja committees gave a mixed reaction to the SDMA directives. Dinesh Kumar, the general secretary of Tuiladungri Durga Puja Samiti in Golmuri, said, “If the government can allow bars and restaurants to remain open till 11 pm, what is wrong with distribution of bhog? The government must reconsider its decision.” The citizens also reacted sharply to the SDMA’s decision to ban the entry of anyone below 18 years of age in the pandals and its decision to ban the use of loudspeakers at the pandal. “The government’s decision to allow 25 people inside the pandal at any given time is welcome, but it should also allow minors inside the pandal too,” Anjan Sarkar, a member of the North Zone Durga Puja Samiti, told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/durga-puja-organisers-want-5-feet-height-cap-on-idols-lifted/articleshow/86241941.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||Jamshedpur||Durga Puja organisers in Ranchi want 5-feet height cap on idols lifted||RANCHI/JAMSHEDPUR: Durga Puja organizing committees in Ranchi on Wednesday unanimously resolved to meet chief minister Hemant Soren and urge him to remove height cap on idols. During a meeting on Tuesday, the state disaster management authority (SDMA) said that all idols have to be under 5ft. The Ranchi District Durga Puja Committee (RDDPC), the umbrella outfit for 165 puja committees here, met at Bakri Bazar in the evening. At the meeting, the RDDPC representatives agreed that due to very little time, it was not possible to alter with the sizes of Durga idols as most committees have already placed their respective orders with the idol-makers. They said that they could not wait for the SDMA’s guideline before placing the order as they were running out of time. RDDPC president Ashok Choudhary said: “A representation of Puja committees will soon meet the CM and urge him to reconsider the directive on the idols’ height.” The RDDPC, however, agreed to adhere to SDMA’s guidelines which said that pandals will not be based on any theme and be devoid of decorative lights and gates. “As per SDMA’s guideline, bhog will not be distributed among the devotees this year too, but it will be offered to the deities in keeping with the tradition,” the RDDPC said in a statement. Besides banning the entry of devotees, SDMA had also banned the organisation of fairs and food carts near the pandals in order to prevent overcrowding. While the RDDPC agreed to adhere to the guidelines, it went a step ahead and decided that they will ensure that the priests and the dhakis are vaccinated before taking part in the rituals which last four days. In Jamshedpur, the puja committees gave a mixed reaction to the SDMA directives. Dinesh Kumar, the general secretary of Tuiladungri Durga Puja Samiti in Golmuri, said, “If the government can allow bars and restaurants to remain open till 11 pm, what is wrong with distribution of bhog?

---||Guwahati||At least one vaccine dose must for entry into Puja pandals in Assam: Health minister Keshab Mahanta||GUWAHATI: At least one dose of Covid vaccine will be mandatory to enter Puja pandals in Assam in the coming festive season, state health minister Keshab Mahanta said on Wednesday. The directive is meant for both devotees and organizers. The upcoming pujas will be confined to mere rituals and the government has curbed cultural programmes around pandals. “The Puja committees will have to take permission from the respective deputy commissioner’s office. All office-bearers of the committees and organizing committee members must get vaccinated with at least one dose before applying,” said Mahanta. He added that the DCs have been asked not to allow any cultural celebrations or fairs linked to pujas. He said the Assam government will put in all efforts to vaccinate all 18+ eligible citizens with the first dose before Durga Puja begins. Mahanta added that the Puja pandals must be spacious with separate entry and exit gates. “The volunteers need to be vaccinated along with the priests,” he said, giving relaxations to the below 18 age group from showing vaccination status. “The size of the idols should not be huge so that only few people can shift these,” he added. On Panchami, Mahanta said, the priests and organizers assisting them will have to go through Covid testing. After Vijaya Dashami, they will be tested again. All the volunteers, priests and puja organizers must get mandatorily tested before the Puja starts and after immersion, even though they are vaccinated. The district administrations have been asked to give permission to Puja organizers only on satisfactory observation of they being adequately vaccinated. Further, sufficient trained volunteers will have to be deployed at the entry points by the organizers. Overall supervision will be done by the squads formed by the district administration. In case any person with suspected symptoms is detected, Puja pandals will immediately bring the matter to the notice of the district administration. The positive cases would have to be shifted to a Covid testing facility.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/at-least-one-vaccine-dose-must-for-entry-into-puja-pandals-in-assam/articleshow/86242168.cms||Kangkan Kalita

---||Patna||Patna breathes easy as workers clean streets||PATNA: A day after sanitation workers called off their indefinite strike, the Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) claimed that the dirty roads and streets were being cleaned properly. The city manager of the PMC’s Bankipore circle, Abhaya Priya, told this reporter on Wednesday, “Our men, who have been working since last night, have already cleaned areas like Ashok Rajpath, Nala Road, and Boring Road. A few lanes that are left will also be cleaned.” Chandra Prakash Singh, the president of the Bihar Sthaniya Nikaay Karmachari Sanyukt Sangharsh Morcha, also claimed that the sanitation workers would remove heaps of garbage from all areas in 48 hours. “If we are determined, we can make the city spick and span in just two days,” he added. Meanwhile, Patnaites heaved a sigh of relief as the sanitation workers resumed the door-to-door trash collection service on Wednesday. More than 7,000 tonnes of wastes had been dumped in every nook and cranny of the city during the strike. Chandani Singh, a resident of Ashok Rajpath, said, “The situation was deteriorating day by day. Had the strike not ended on Tuesday, we would have continued to suffer.” A Boring Canal Road resident, Atul Kumar, recalled, “Foul smell emanated from the heaps of garbage people had dumped on the roads. The showers worsened the situation.” More than 40,000 sanitation workers, sweepers and other fourth grade employees in 258 urban local bodies, including 18 municipal corporations, 83 nagar parishads and 157 nagar panchayats, had gone on an indefinite strike from September 7, demanding regularisation of jobs. They agreed to call off their strike and return to work on the Patna high court’s directive on Tuesday. The court asked the state government to consider the demands of the protesters and take necessary action in eight weeks. “The government should consider and fulfil our demands so that we do not stage protests in future. Even we do not want to cause any inconvenience to the residents,” Chandra Prakash said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/patna-breathes-easy-as-workers-clean-streets/articleshow/86239589.cms||---

The theme for this year’s Ozone Day is ‘Montreal Protocol – keeping us, our food and vaccines cool posing impetus on boosting the cold chain’. This will provide producers such as farmers and pharmaceutical providers with access to pre-cooling, refrigerated storage and refrigerated transport, ensuring that products such as food and vaccines reach people in safe and good condition. According to World Meteorological Organization 2021 assessment, the Antarctic ozone hole, one of the deepest and largest gaps in the ozone layer, has closed in the last 40 years. However, changes in the stratospheric ozone and climate over the past 40 years have altered the solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation conditions on the earth’s surface. Ozone layer depletion has also contributed to climate change across the globe. These changes are interacting in complex ways to affect human health, food and water security besides ecosystem services. Ozone depletion increases the amount of UV-B that reaches the earth’s surface. Laboratory and epidemiological studies demonstrate that UV-B causes non-melanoma skin cancer and plays a major role in malignant melanoma development. Additionally, UV-B has been linked to the development of cataracts, a clouding of the eye lens. The interactions between stratospheric ozone, climate and UV radiation will, therefore, shift over time. However, the Montreal Protocol will continue to have far-reaching benefits for human well-being and environmental sustainability. The Montreal Protocol global agreement to protect the stratospheric ozone layer is one of the most successful environmental agreements to date. A united global effort to phase out ODS means that today, the hole in the ozone layer is healing and, in turn, protecting human health, economies and ecosystems. With the collaborative efforts of governments, scientists and industry, 99% of these ODSs have been phased out. But the work of the Montreal Protocol is not yet over. Through its Kigali amendment, the international community is finding alternatives for coolants that contribute to the growing menace of climate disruption. India became a signatory to Montreal Protocol in 1992 and it has met the phaseout targets of all the ODSs as per the Montreal Protocol Schedule. It has also completely phased out Hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC)-141b, which is a chemical used by foam manufacturing enterprises and one of the most potent ozone depleting chemicals after chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). India has also launched a new plan to phase out HCFCs by 2030. India has consciously chosen a path for environment-friendly and energy-efficient technologies while phasing out ODSs. Importantly, India is one among the few countries and a pioneer in some cases in the use of technologies, which are non-ozone depleting and have a low global warming potential. Besides, India has incorporated, under its regulatory framework, a rule known as Ozone Depleting Substances (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000. Its amendments have been published in the Gazette of India under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The responsibility of the most effective implementation of the Montreal Protocol with Kigali amendment falls on the shoulders of each and every individual to protect the ozone layer.

---||Hubballi||Industrialists at Gamanagatti frustrated by need to take long detour||Hubballi: Notwithstanding the many expansive statements made by political leaders reiterating the government’s support to the industrial sector, the situation on the ground is not nearly as conducive to industrial growth. The situation in the Gamanagatti Industrial Estate, where there are more than 100 companies functioning employing thousands of people, is a case in point. Employees are forced to travel an additional distance of nearly 10km daily owing to the Karnataka Industrial Area Development Board’s (KIADB) failure to construct a service road next to the Hubballi-Dharwad bypass road. This has compelled people to commute between Hubballi and Gamanagatti via Tarihal. Industrialists lashed out at the KIADB for failing to ensure proper connectivity after allotting sites for the factories. President of Green Tech Park, an association of industrialists at Gamanagatti, Nagaraj Divate told TOI that they had been demanding the construction of a direct road from Tarihal Bypass Junction for the past five years. “If the service road is constructed, we will have to travel just 0.8km from Tarihal junction. We have appealed to the chief secretary and local MLAs, but to no avail. Although the government did sanction Rs 8 crore for the project, work never started on the road. KIADB officials have been assuring us of floating a tender for the road. The government has planned a six-lane bypass, and we have demanded that a 100-foot service road be constructed. Officials in the public works department have assured us of incorporating the service road in the plan,” Divate said. PM Veeresha Sharma, an industrialist with a factory at Gamanagatti, said that the long detour that commuters had to take daily was a nightmarish experience, particularly one connecting Tarihal and Gamanagatti industrial estates. “The movement of heavy vehicles has increased markedly at Tarihal junction. Owing to the pathetic condition of the road, many investors are reluctant to start their units here, and customers are hesitant to give industries here orders. Gamanagatti is just 5km from the Hubballi Airport, but we have to travel 9km. It is a huge burden, both in terms of cost and time, that industrialists have to bear,” Sharma said. MLA Arvind Bellad, under whose constituency Gamanagatti Industrial Estate falls, admitted to the imminent need to develop infrastructure in the area. “We had pitched the idea, and submitted a memorandum to Jagadish Shettar, who was industrial minister. But we are uncertain if the proposal is under active consideration now,” Bellad said. Assistant secretary of KIADB’s Dharwad zone Sanjeev Uppar, however, admitted to being unaware of such a demand. He suggested that KIADB, Dharwad zone’s deputy development officer KM Mohan Kumar would probably have the answers. However, neither Kumar nor KIADB Belagavi zone’s in-charge development officer TS Lakshmeesha answered to repeated calls and messages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/industrialists-at-gamanagatti-frustrated-by-need-to-take-long-detour/articleshow/86239259.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

Private school managements across the state had moved the high court, terming the GOs as arbitrary and illegal. Senior counsels B Adinarayana Rao, P Veera Reddy and Vedula Venkata Ramana argued on behalf of the school managements. They said the APSEMRC does not have powers to fix the fee in private educational institutions. The commission can only regulate the fee to prevent commercialisation of education and profiteering by the schools. The senior counsels relied on various constitutional bench judgements of the Supreme Court to buttress their arguments. The counsel for APSEMRC, BSN Naidu argued that powers conferred on the commission to regulate the fee also include fixation of fee. He said the petitions are premature as the commission has given an option to submit the fee estimates if they feel the fee fixed by the commission is not sufficient to meet their requirements. He said the petitioners moved the high court in order to avoid submission of account books. After hearing arguments of both parties, Justice U Durga Prasad Rao reserved orders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hc-reserves-order-on-gos-on-school-fees/articleshow/86241207.cms||Srikanth Aluri
---||Patna||Now, third party vehicle insurance must in Bihar||PATNA: The road accident victims and their families will now get Rs 5 lakh as interim compensation for death and Rs50,000 in case of grievous injury, irrespective of the fact that it was a hit-and-run case or the vehicle was insured or not. The amendment to the Bihar Motor Vehicle Rules, 1992, which empowers the state transport appellate tribunal to settle all such accident claims within 60 days, has come into effect on Wednesday. It was notified in the Bihar gazette on August 11 after a cabinet order. State transport secretary Sanjay Kumar Agarwal said third party insurance is now mandatory for all vehicles as per the Motor Vehicles Act. “The third party insurance is not very costly and the rates are fixed by the Insurance Regularity and Development Authority (IRDA). The comprehensive insurance is not required, if the vehicle owner has third party insurance,” Agarwal said on Wednesday. “Under the new amendment, the uninsured vehicles in the state would attract a fine of Rs2,000 and Rs4,000 for repeat offence. A habitual violator would even lose the driving licence. If an uninsured vehicle is involved in road accidents and deaths, then it would be confiscated and auctioned to raise money to compensate the victims and their family members. For the compensation, we have a revolving fund of Rs50 crore, which has been sanctioned by the state government,” he said. He said the new rule will simplify the litigation process for the road accident victims. “The state government will contest the case in the tribunal on behalf of the road accident victims. But the victims have to file the case in local police station and apply for the compensation at DTO office. The DTO will contest the case. The department will soon launch an online portal, so that the victims or their families can apply for the compensation,” Agarwal said. The state transport department has decided to launch a special campaign from September 20 to take action against drivers of vehicles without the third party insurance. The drive will be conducted under the guidance of district transport officers. The transport secretary said during the campaign, camps will also be organised by the insurance companies to provide third party insurance to the vehicle owners. “The drive is not only to impose fine on uninsured vehicles but to create awareness as well as to motivate them to get the insurance. Five insurance companies have decided to hold camps across the state. The decision was taken during a meeting with the heads of the companies on Tuesday,” Agarwal said. According to sources, around 5,000 people die in road accidents in Bihar every year while the number of people injured is much higher. Every year, the state government needs Rs200 to 250 crore to provide compensation to the victims across the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/now-third-party-vehicle-insurance-must-in-bihar/articleshow/86239462.cms||Faryal Rumi

The district administrations have already started the work to identify suitable lands for these health hubs where the government is inviting private investment. The government wants to have corporate hospitals, including major and multi-specialities, to come up in these health hubs. Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy has already directed officials of the health department and district collectors to identify land and invite corporates in the health sector to come forward. Along with building village health clinics and strengthening primary health centres (PHCs), the government wants private partnership to increase health infrastructure in the state. The chief minister has on several occasions felt that people are going to neighbouring Telangana, Tamil Nadu or Karnataka to treat major health issues, as the state after bifurcation had no major hospital in any of its 13 districts. The chief minister has directed officials to ensure 50% of beds in the hospitals in the health hubs are kept exclusively for Aarogyasri patients. The hospitals, irrespective of the speciality, coming up in the health hubs would have to cater to patients under the Aarogyasri health care programme of the state government. Having strengthened the government general hospitals, the chief minister had directed officials to strengthen government hospitals and recruit staff, including doctors and nurses. The government is now working on recruiting more health professionals in the government sector, including at least two doctors for every village clinic. While one doctor would stay and attend to patients at the village clinic, the other doctor would go around in the 104 ambulance, visiting families. The chief minister directed officials to have doctors start visiting families under the family doctor concept from November 15. This would start in village clinics and PHCs in 258 mandals in the first phase. The second phase would cover the remaining mandals, and will be launched on January 26, 2022. “A doctor with supporting staff in 104 ambulance should start visiting every family in the state by January 26, 2022,” the chief minister told officials and asked them to recruit the required doctors and other professionals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/ap-eyes-boost-to-med-infra-with-health-hubs/articleshow/86253377.cms||Gopi Dara

Speaking to the media at the party office, Nagireddy said the farmers are unable to understand why Naidu and his men took to the streets while they were busy with agriculture operations after surplus rainfall in all regions. He said agriculture production, which was 153.95 lakh metric tonnes during Naidu’s tenure, touched 175 lakh metric tonnes in 2019-20 and 163 lakh metric tonnes in 2020-21 after Jagan came to power. He said the production of foodgrains shows how content the farmers were in the last two years. Nagireddy wanted to know whether the TDP was staging protests because it is unable to see the higher production levels of the last two years. The agriculture mission vice-chairman said the farmers faced serious debts only due to the anti-farmer policies adopted by Naidu between 2014 and 2019. “Jagan government cleared Rs 8,700 crore dues towards agriculture supply by the distribution companies and ensured 9-hour power supply during the daytime. Naidu promised to write off agriculture loans to the tune of Rs 87,000 crore but did not clear even Rs 14,000 crore, pushing the farmers into deep debts.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/former-cm-landed-ryots-in-debt-trap-alleges-nagireddy/articleshow/86241788.cms||Samdani MN

Chandrasekaran was reacting to a Bloomberg News report that said Tata Sons is considering a historic revamp of its leadership structure by creating a CEO’s role to help improve corporate governance. “We are extremely disappointed with such stories that create disruption to regular operations,” he added. Tata Trusts chairman Ratan Tata too expressed disappointment with the report that stated he is seen as critical in implementing the leadership revamp. Tata Trusts is the majority shareholder of Tata Sons, which runs the salt-to-software conglomerate that traces its roots back to 1868. The report, citing people engaged in the deliberations, said the plan is to have a CEO guide the company’s sprawling businesses, while the chairman supervises the CEO’s functioning on behalf of shareholders. “Such speculation can only serve to cause disruption amongst a team that has been operating smoothly with impressive growth in market value,” Ratan Tata said. The report also said that Tata Sons is considering renewing Chandrasekaran’s chairmanship term, which ends next February.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tata-sons-denies-management-rejig-plan/articleshow/86245313.cms||---

Tejashwi also alleged that the move has been planned by slowing down the vaccination process in the state because Nitish was afraid of losing his chair after BJP changed its CM in Gujarat and planning the same in some other NDA-ruled states. The Bihar CM has announced a mega Covid-19 vaccination drive across the state on September 17 to mark Modi’s birthday. “Nitish Ji is busy in flattering PM Modi, the same person from whom he had snatched the plate earlier,” Tejashwi told a TV news channel. “The vaccination drive started in January. How many people have been given the vaccines so far?” Tejashwi asked. He also slammed the BJP for organising a mega celebration on PM’s birthday, while the people in state were suffering from flood and fertilizers crisis. Congress state spokesperson Rajesh Rathorre said the man who a few years ago had delivered speeches against PM Modi was now busy in celebrating his birthday. “In past six months, the BJP has changed four chief ministers. Nitish knows he will also be ousted by the BJP and is leaving no stone unturned to save his chair,” Rathorre said. However, JD(U) state spokesperson Arvind Nishad hit back at the opposition leaders and said Tejashwi should first update himself about the works being done by the state government. Sharing the data, Nishad said so far over 4.39 crore people have been tested and now Bihar had only 73 active Covid cases on Tuesday. “Tejashwi is suffering from a disease called rajnetik rataundhi (political night blindeness). He is still in the shock of not becoming the CM and sees everything from the same prism,” said Nishad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tejashwi-nitish-delays-covid-vaccination-drive-to-celebrate-pms-birthday/articleshow/86239999.cms||Sheezan Nezami

The closure of these facilities has meant that children are deprived of open spaces to play during the weekend. The Mahatma Gandhi Park, which also houses the Indira Glass House, Unkal Lake and Nrupatunga Betta were among the favourite haunts of Hubballi residents. However, with work on a Smart City project under way there, MG Park has been closed, and with the toy train project expected to take at least three or four months to be completed, the residents can do little but endure an agonising wait. On the other hand, conditions at Unkal Lake and Nrupatunga Betta are hardly conducive for children to play. In addition to children being deprived of places for fun, the pandemic has compelled many amusement parks to shut shop, leaving hundreds of people employed in these establishments without a job. Keshwapur resident Shruti D said that children were eager to go out and stretch their legs now that schools had reopened, and restrictions being eased across the board. “The amusement parks are yet to open, while the condition of the play areas set up at the parks by the government is very poor,” Shruti said. Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation commissioner Suresh Itnal said that the civic agency had completed procuring equipment to be installed at Tolankere Lake. “Work on installation of this equipment for the amusement of children is under way. We are working on a proposal to undertake a similar initiative at Unkal Lake, while the forest department will do the same at Nrupatunga Betta. We have already installed such equipment in various parks in Dharwad, and are only waiting for these areas to be formally inaugurated,” Itnal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/closure-of-parks-poor-condition-of-play-areas-frustrate-kids/articleshow/86240085.cms||J Abbas Mulla

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh eyes boost to med infra with health hubs||VIJAYAWADA: The state government is working on establishing health hubs in all 13 districts and the three major municipal corporations of Vijayawada, Visakhapatnam and Tirupati. The district administrations have already started the work to identify suitable lands for these health hubs where the government is inviting private investment. The government wants to have corporate hospitals, including major and multi-specialities, to come up in these health hubs. Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy has already directed officials of the health department and district collectors to identify land and invite corporates in the health sector to come forward. Along with building village health clinics and strengthening primary health centres (PHCs), the government wants private partnership to increase health infrastructure in the state. The chief minister has on several occasions felt that people are going to neighbouring Telangana, Tamil Nadu or Karnataka to treat major health issues, as the state after bifurcation had no major hospital in any of its 13 districts. The chief minister has directed officials to ensure 50% of beds in the hospitals in the health hubs are kept exclusively for Aarogyasri patients. The hospitals, irrespective of the speciality, coming up in the health hubs would have to cater to patients under the Aarogyasri health care programme of the state government. Having strengthened the government general hospitals, the chief minister had directed officials to strengthen government hospitals and recruit staff, including doctors and nurses. The government is now working on recruiting more health professionals in the government sector, including at least two doctors for every village clinic. While one doctor would stay and attend to patients at the village clinic, the other doctor would go around in the 104 ambulance, visiting families. The chief minister directed officials to have doctors start visiting families under the family doctor concept from November 15. This would start in village clinics and PHCs in 258 mandals in the first phase. The second phase would cover the remaining mandals, and will be launched on January 26, 2022. “A doctor with supporting staff in 104 ambulance should start visiting every family in the state by January 26, 2022,” the chief minister told officials and asked them to recruit the required doctors and other professionals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ap-eyes-boost-to-med-infra-with-health-hubs/articleshow/86241736.cms||Gopi Dara
---||Patna||I’m not a co-accused with Prince Raj: Chirag Paswan||PATNA: Jamui MP Chirag Paswan on Wednesday denied that he was a co-accused in the FIR lodged at the Connaught Place police station in Delhi by a woman, alleging rape committed on her by Samastipur MP Prince Raj. When asked by a media person if he was also an accused in the FIR lodged against his cousin Prince Raj, Chirag said, “It is true that my name figures in the FIR, but I have not been mentioned as an accused.” Chirag said he had been mentioned in the FIR as the one who had the “knowledge” of the incident. It is partially true, as he came to know about the incident later, when Prince and the victim came to meet him to find a solution to their personal problem. “After listening to them, I asked them to go to the police and file an FIR. I was not a policeman and, therefore, asked them to go to the police who have to do the investigation work,” Chirag said, adding that he came to know about the incident later. It surfaced again after the split in his LJP on June 13. “I had presented my position at a press conference even then. Besides, after I came to know about the incident, I took it to the party’s disciplinary committee. But he (Prince) was expelled from the party in any case due to the split,” Chirag said. In reply to the claim made by BJP minister Neeraj Kumar Singh Babloo that Chirag was still in the NDA, he said, “I have repeatedly said that it is not my priority. My priority is the ongoing Ashirvad Yatra, and my efforts are geared to strengthening the organization, nothing other than that.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/im-not-a-co-accused-with-prince-chirag/articleshow/86240165.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Vijayawada||CM urges women to start small businesses||Vijayawada: Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy asked officials to encourage and support women to become small-time entrepreneurs. He wanted officials to facilitate tie-ups between corporate companies, business majors and women, to sustain businesses established by women through self-help groups (SHGs). The chief minister held a review meeting with officials at his Tadepalli camp office on Wednesday, at which he wanted officials to identify women to start small businesses in their own place. The government is extending financial support through the YSR Cheyutha and YSR Aasara schemes, he sought to remind officials. The chief minister said the government also revived zero interest loans that were cancelled during the TDP regime and partnered with major companies such as ITC, Reliance and Amul to support women entrepreneurs. The chief minister directed officials to ensure spot documentation while availing loans for employment avenues that contribute to sustainable economic growth. Officials informed the chief minister that over eight lakh SHGs have benefited under the Aasara scheme, where the government has given Rs 6,330.58 crore in the first tranche. Officials further said the social audit of the list of beneficiaries for the second tranche has been completed and the lists have been displayed in village secretariats. Similarly, through YSR Cheyutha in the first installment, three lakh women have set up businesses such as retail shops, rearing cattle, buffaloes, sheep, and goats. In the second phase, the government is aiming to create employment opportunities for 2,21,598 women. As the government launched sustainable economic growth plans with Procter & Gamble, ITC, Hindustan Unilever, Reliance Retail, Amul and Allana companies in the previous year, this year the government is entering into MoUs with Reliance’s Ajio, Tanager, Rural Development Centre, Mahindra, Gain and Kalgudi. The chief minister asked officials to come up with special programmes ahead of the disbursement of second tranche of Aasara initiative by involving the public representatives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/cm-urges-women-to-start-small-businesses/articleshow/86241949.cms||Gopi Dara
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Police focus on cyber crime after five-fold rise in 2 years||KOLKATA: A five-fold rise in cyber crime cases in Kolkata over two years reflects the increased online engagement of citizens in the post-pandemic scenario, felt cops. While 32 FIRs pertaining to cyber crime were registered in 2018, the number shot up to 172 in 2020. Though the spike in Kolkata is significant, the number is miniscule when compared to Bengaluru (8,892) and Hyderabad (2,553). According to police, the sharp rise in the rate of online crime is a result of people spending more time online to work, transact and interact. While the rise in online bank transactions led to more cases of cyber fraud, increased social interaction online resulted in more cases of cheating and obscenity. The police also dealt with fake news, registering 11 cases. This is the third highest among cities after Hyderabad (112) and Chennai (14). The NCRB figures also showed that investigation of cyber fraud cases could be long-drawn, with cops enlisting the help of multiple firms and agencies, and dealing with accused operating from other cities. There are 498 cases that are currently pending investigation. Altogether, 18 people were arrested in 2020 for their involvement in cyber crime, but there has been no conviction yet. In at least nine cases, cops were convinced that the accused they identified was involved, but could not go for a charge sheet due to insufficient evidence. An analysis of motives behind the 172 registered cases showed that 54 were cases of personal revenge, 56 others were committed with the intention to commit fraud, nine pertained to extortion while obscene acts were involved in three. Cops have now started training themselves in cyber crime detection and have begun spreading awareness on the need to be vigilant. On Wednesday, Kolkata Police organised a training session on online child sexual exploitation with domain experts from the UK and the US conducting the event. “We are getting a lot of complaints of cyber bullying, which is new for us. We also need to know basic counselling in such cases. The training is aimed at making us aware of the same,” said an officer. Cops have also been asked to undergo compulsory certification in computer hacking and forensic, and investigation, along with certification in network security and certification in ethical hacking. Initially, 45 cops will undergo this training. Over 150 others will undergo a less intense cyber security awareness certification.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/police-focus-on-cyber-crime-after-five-fold-rise-in-2-years/articleshow/86244530.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Kolkata||Club in road rage was part of 2016 Panditiya condo attack||Kolkata: The youths involved in Sunday’s road rage incident near Gorky Sadan were from the same belt from where men had stormed an upscale condominium complex on Panditiya Road five years ago and smashed 75 cars. The police have till now arrested two persons, both of whom reside in the Panditiya Road neighbourhood. On Wednesday, police arrested main accused Bishal Sardar (22) who had fired at Howrah businessman Pankaj Singh. Sardar, a former resident of Motilal Nehru Road, was picked up from the Priya Nath Mullick Road-Nafar Kundu Road crossing in Bhowanipore. He now lives in Kayasthapara, Garfa. On Tuesday, police had arrested Ronit Gupta (21), a resident of Sevak Baidya Street near Dover Terrace that lies on the other side of Hazra Road. The duo, along with 15-16 others astride six bikes, had accompanied two trucks carrying local residents and a Ganesha idol from Amra Panch Bhai Club on Deodar Street for immersion. The procession had taken Ballygunge Circular Road to reach Beckbagan crossing and turned on to AJC Bose Road, heading towards Babughat. It was on the way that Singh’s car attempted to overtake them, leading to a heated exchange, a chase and then the firing. Sources said the youths come from the very localities from where men and boys had stormed into Oasis residential complex on Panditiya Road five years ago and then gone on a rampage, vandalising cars parked on the premises. The trigger then was a hit-and-run accident in which a local youth had died. The men from Dover Road and Deodar Street had, at the time, suspected that the man who had caused the accident had taken shelter in Oasis and launched the attack. Investigations later revealed that the man lived further down Hazra Road at Garcha near Ballygunge Phanri. Following that incident, police had made several arrests, all from the localities from where the accused in Sunday’s road rage incident also live. During interrogation, Sardar told cops that he had received the firearm, a crude country-made one-shotter, from a “friend”. He had kept it with himself during the immersion procession as he thought a couple of his friends were also carrying their guns. “His claims are being verified. But the fact that he assumed others were carrying weapons shows that there might have been a couple of others in that procession who possessed arms,” said a source. Cops said raids may be conducted in the area to seize illegal weapons. Lalbazar is also looking into how the local police allowed the youths to start the immersion procession around 10.30pm, since there are curbs on movement between 11pm and 5am except in case of emergencies. Local cops said the organizers had not taken permission for either the puja or its immersion. Sardar used to deliver food from a dhaba before lockdown and now supplies bottled water. The other person arrested, Gupta, works for an online food delivery platform.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/club-in-road-rage-was-part-of-2016-panditiya-condo-attack/articleshow/86244774.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Business||Sebi bars Poonawalla Fincorp MD||Mumbai: Within six months of its entry into the financial services space through the acquisition of Magma Fincorp, the Poonawalla Group, more famous for its vaccine-manufacturing capability, faced a setback. On Wednesday evening, markets regulator Sebi barred Poonawalla Fincorp’s MD Abhay Bhutada and seven other entities connected with him from the market for insider trading in Magma Fincorp stock leading to its acquisition. Initial Sebi investigation showed that the eight entities together had profited by about Rs 13.5 crore through such trades using illegal means. Sebi has also ordered impounding of the bank accounts of these eight entities. In its 46-page interim order, Sebi noted that in February 2021, its surveillance system generated insider trading alerts related to Magma Fincorp’s shares. This was around when Rising Sun Holding (RSHPL), an arm of the Poonawalla Group, announced it will acquire Magma Fincorp. Following up on those alerts, Sebi conducted a preliminary examination into the Magma Fincorp stock to check if there was indeed any insider trading activity. The order noted that Bhutada, who had access to the unpublished price-sensitive information (UPSI), seemingly engaged in fraudulent activities by sharing such information with several other people known to him who, in turn, bought shares of Magma Fincorp before the news was made public. “Based on the discussions and factual findings on the connections, phone calls and funds transfers among various entities as well as transmission of UPSI from (Bhutada) to other entities... it can now be prima facie held that the (eight) entities, by pursuing a modus operandi, have carried out insider trading activities in the scrip of Magma,” noted the Sebi order, by its whole-time member S K Mohanty. Prior to the acquisition, Bhutada was the MD & CEO of Poonawalla Finance, a subsidiary of RSHPL and after the acquisition has taken over as the MD of Poonawalla Fincorp. Along with Bhutada, Saumil Shah, Surabhi Kishore Shah, Amit Agrawal, Murlidhar Bagranglal Agrawal, Rakesh Rajendra Bhojgadhiya, Rakesh Rajendra Bhojgadhiya (HUF) and Abhijit Pawar have been named in the Sebi investigation report. To protect the interest of investors and ensure market integrity, the regulator decided to take immediate action, Sebi said. The regulator has also asked the eight entities to file their replies with it within 21 days. The report mentioned that Bhojgadhiya, Pawar and Saumil Shah are having continuous and an on-going strong relationship with Bhutada even after the event of insider trading. Sebi investigations also raised suspicion that Bhutada, being the main provider of insider information, probably had also been compensated monetarily by the other seven who profited from prior information about Poonawalla Group’s bid to acquire Magma Fincorp. Since the start of the pandemic, the Pune-headquartered Poonawalla Group has made headlines for its vaccine-manufacturing capabilities. Currently, Serum Institute, controlled by the group, is the largest vaccine manufacturer in the world by volume and has supplied millions of Covid vaccine doses globally. Its partnered AstraZeneca which holds the licence of the vaccine developed by Oxford University. Since the launch of the Covishield vaccine, the group has emerged as one of the mainstays of India’s fight against the Chinese-origin virus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sebi-bars-poonawalla-fincorp-md/articleshow/86245144.cms||---

A total of 20,965 names have been excluded from the Khadki Cantonment Board (KCB), 10,000 from Dehu Road Cantonment Board (DCB), and 5,036 from Pune Cantonment Board (PCB) limits. Chief executive officers of all the three cantonments said that the encroachers on defence land were excluded from the voter lists as per the Supreme Court order. Pramod Kumar Singh, CEO, KCB, said, “As per the Supreme Court ruling in the case of Cantonment board VS Gopal Das Kabra, no encroacher on defence land is qualified to cast vote in the cantonment elections. As per the procedure, we have sought suggestions and objections from the people. The president of the board conducted hearings before finalising the list.” The DCB has reconstituted wards as the number of voters among seven wards was huge, said R Haritwal, chief executive officer. In the PCB limits, all eight wards have registered a drop in the number of voters. “But the difference is not drastic, so we did not have to go for delimitation of the wards,” said Amit Kumar, CEO, PCB. “As per the cantonment act, our officials visited registered houses and finalised the list. Those who produced relevant documents during the hearing conducted by the cantonment board president, were included in the list,” added Kumar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/over-36000-names-removed-from-voters-lists-in-3-cantts/articleshow/86244817.cms||Sandip Dighe

---||Kolkata||West Bengal eighth safest among states, but crime against children, women are areas of concern||KOLKATA: Bengal, with a population of 977.2 lakh, has ranked eighth among the 28 states — as far as crime rate is concerned — mentioned in the National Crime Records Bureau report for 2020, which was published on Tuesday. The score of 186.6 (both IPC and SLL inclusive) is way below the national average of 478.4. Additionally, most of the states ranking above Bengal are the smallest, located in northeast India, except Jharkhand. Bengal has also performed exceptionally in bringing down accidents. The state has lodged just one UAPA case and has a charge-sheet rate of 88, which puts it among the top 10 states. There are, however, certain areas of concern. The state has recorded one of the sharpest spikes in crime against children in the last three years, recording 10,248 cases. In 2019, there were 6,191 cases. According to the NCRB report, Madhya Pradesh, with 17,008 cases of crime against children, tops the list followed by Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra with 15,271 and 14,371 cases respectively. Bengal is ranked fourth. Out of the 36 states and UTs, only nine registered a spike in crime against children. Bengal registered the sharpest spike in crimes listed under Indian Penal Code and Special and Local Laws. However, the state’s rate of crime against children is still low compared to many states. The rate is calculated as the number of cases recorded per 100,000 children. According to the 2011 census, Bengal has 30 million children and the rate of crime against kids is 34. In contrast, Sikkim reported 147 incidents. But given its child population of around 200,000, the rate comes to around 71. It is 91 for Delhi and more than 100 for Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Bengal is ranked ninth overall. There was a similar dichotomy in case of crimes against women. Bengal and Odisha saw the most increase in crimes against women in 2020 compared to 2019 while Delhi and UP saw a decline. However, the rise of around 22% from 29,859 cases in 2019 to 36,439 in 2020 is not a true reflection of facts. The state has witnessed just nine women being murdered — one of the lowest in the country. Out of the 36,000-plus cases, 19,962 pertained to cruelty by husbands. Bengal has always reported these cases in high numbers with the administration taking a proactive stance and encouraging women to report them. The state has witnessed 1,128 rapes, but does not figure among the first 10 states from where maximum cases have been reported. The rate of crime against women in Bengal is 76.2, way below Telangana, Rajasthan, Odisha, Haryana and Assam. The state has witnessed 1,948 murders and 14,751 cases of attempt to murder. While several big states reported higher murder figures, police here said they have been slapping the harsh attempt-to-murder charge as they want to send a strong signal. The state has lodged the highest number of attempt-to-murder cases in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengal-8th-safest-among-states-but-crime-against-kids-women-are-areas-of-concern/articleshow/86244743.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh HC issues non bailable warrant against special chief secretary of agriculture department||VIJAYAWADA: The Andhra Pradesh high court on Wednesday issued a non bailable warrant (NBW) against agriculture department special chief secretary, Poonam Malakondaiah.The high court had summoned Poonam Malakondaiah and others in a contempt case for personal appearance. As she neither appeared in person nor filed an application for dispensing with appearance, the high court took serious note and issued the NBW against her. A group of 17 retired employees had moved the high court, contending inaction of the officials in implementing the high court’s orders. The petitioners who worked as full-time contingent employees since 1993, in the department of sericulture, earlier moved the high court seeking for regularisation of their service and pensionary benefits post retirement. The high court on February 28, 2020 passed orders in their favour and directed the state government to pay pensionary benefits. They moved a contempt petition against the special chief secretary of the agriculture department, finance secretary and commissioner of sericulture for not complying with the court orders. The high court had earlier summoned the respondents for personal appearance. On Wednesday, when the matter came up for hearing, only finance secretary S S Rawat and commissioner of sericulture Chiranjeevi Chowdary appeared before the court. The government pleader told the high court that they have filed an application for dispensing with appearance on behalf of Poonam Malakondaiah. However, the application was not found in the court records. Justice Battu Devanand took a serious view of the issue and observed that the officials wilfully did not comply with the court’s orders. He said a final order will be given on September 29 and issued an NBW against Poonam Malakondiah.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/high-court-issues-nbw-against-spl-chief-secretary-of-agri-dept/articleshow/86241271.cms||Srikanth Aluri
---||Patna||Bihar man refuses to return money mistakenly sent by bank, held||PATNA: A man was arrested and sent to jail on Tuesday for refusing to return Rs5.5 lakh mistakenly credited by the Dakshin Bihar Gramin Bank to his account in the same bank in Khagaria district in March last year. The 30-year-old Ranjeet Das of Bakhtiyar village under Mansi police station area in Khagaria district refused to return the entire amount despite several notices issued by the Mansi branch of the bank as he said the money was sent by PM Narendra Modi. A bank officer, on the condition of anonymity, said Das had returned a part of the amount under pressure of the senior bank officials, but later refused to return the rest Rs1,60,970. Das told the bank officials that he had already spent the money. “I was very happy when I received a message on my mobile phone that Rs5.5 lakh had been credited to my account. It was a big amount for a poor man like me. I thought the money had been sent by PM Narendra Modi as the first instalment of the total Rs15 lakh he had promised to every individual during an election campaign in Bihar,” Das, a tutor by profession, reportedly told the investigating officers. On August 17 this year, the manager of the Mansi branch of Dakshin Bihar Gramin Bank, Satya Narayan Prasad, lodged an FIR against Das with the Mansi police station and sought action against him. Mansi police station SHO Deepak Kumar said Das was booked under Section 406 (criminal breach of trust) of IPC and sent jail. The SHO said the bank officials tried to persuade Das to return the money erroneously credited to his account, but he refused and said the money had been spent. The bank had sent half a dozen notices to Das in the last one year. The SHO, however, said the lapses on the part of the bank would also be probed. Initial investigation revealed that Das withdrew the money from his account in different instalments in three months. If held guilty by the court, the accused may be imprisoned for a term up to three years or fine or both, a practising lawyer of the Patna high court, Rajiv Ranjan Pandey, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/khagaria-man-refuses-to-return-money-mistakenly-sent-by-bank-to-his-a/c-held/articleshow/86240463.cms||Ramashankar

---||Patna||RJD: Govt should fulfil Raghuvansh Prasad Singh’s demands||PATNA: RJD on Wednesday accused the NDA leaders of giving wrong interpretation of the letter which former union minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh had written to RJD chief Lalu Prasad just before his death by terming it as his resignation letter from the party. RJD state spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan also criticized CM Nitish Kumar and Prime Minister Narendra Modi for not fulfilling the demand of Singh from his death bed. “Both PM and CM had assured to fulfil all the demands raised by Singh. However, even after one year, no step has been taken in that direction,” Gagan said. In his three different letters to Bihar CM, Singh had asked him to hoist the national flag at Vaishali Garh on the Republic Day, bring back the bhiksha paatra (alms bowl) of Gautam Buddha from Afghanistan to India and bring an ordinance for amendment to MGNREGA. Singh, in his letter, had talked about the 32 years of his association with the RJD boss and how he had always stood by him. Gagan said the letter reveals the deep relation of Singh with Lalu and how Singh had mentioned he will no longer be able to be with him. “He had also addressed party workers and common people and sought forgiveness from all. Why will he address everyone and ask for forgiveness in a resignation letter?” said Gagan adding, “The content of the letter was portrayed in a negative sense intentionally by the ruling JD(U) and BJP for political advantage before the assembly elections.” However, JD(U) state spokesperson Neeraj Kumar lashed out at the RJD for insulting Singh once again after his death and making his letter a political issue now. “Those letters had his signature and his family members had acknowledged that those were written by Singh. In the letter to Lalu Prasad, Singh’s disappointment with RJD could be felt. He was insulted by Tej Pratap, who had compared a leader of Singh’s stature with a pot of water.

According to Patna civil surgeon (CS), Dr Vibha Kumari, these health facilities have been asked to reserve five beds each with oxygen supply for kids with serious conditions. They have also been told to provide ambulance service to the severely-ill patients so that they can reach the Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) or the Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH) easily. “Since a large number of children experience such seasonal problems every year, there is nothing to worry about. We have, anyway, ensured that the hospitals in different districts have a proper oxygen supply system,” the CS told this reporter and added that 38 cases of viral fever were reported from the PHCs and sub-divisional hospitals on Wednesday. Incidentally, as many as 1,239 children with different problems have visited the Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH) from September 1 to 15. Its superintendent, Dr Binod Kumar Singh, claimed, “Of these, 202 were diagnosed with pneumonia. While the kids, who showed signs of improvement, were discharged, 79 are still undergoing treatment at the NMCH.” On the contrary, lesser number of viral fever cases have been recorded at the PMCH. Its deputy superintendent, Dr A K Jha, pointed out, “Of the 17 children, who turned up at the outpatient clinic of the paediatric ward on Wednesday, 14 were discharged. Only three of them were admitted here.” Dr Lokesh Tiwari, the head of the paediatric department at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Patna, claimed, “Although 16 children with respiratory problems had consulted our doctors, none of them was admitted to the hospital.” Besides, all the 120 beds at the Mahavir Vaatsalya Hospital (MVH), a private health faculty for children, were occupied on Wednesday as several cases of viral fever, pneumonia, and other problems came to light. The head of the paediatrics department at the MVH, Dr Binay Ranjan, admitted that majority of the children had viral infections and pneumonia. Some of them even suffered from multisystem inflammatory syndrome.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rise-in-viral-fever-cases-flu-corners-to-be-set-up-in-sub-divisional-hospitals-phcs/articleshow/86239700.cms||VK Tripathi
---||Vadodara||Gujarat: Cyber crimes spiked 64% during Covid-19 pandemic||VADODARA: The digital transactions saw a manifold jump last year due to Covid-19 pandemic that compelled people to use online services. But the increase in digital traffic also drew cyber frauds, who saw it as an opportunity to con unsuspecting users. The report on Crime in India released by National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) on Wednesday revealed that in 2020 cyber crimes increased by 64% in Gujarat compared to the previous year. According to the NCRB report, 784 cybercrime offences were registered in 2019 and the numbers shot up to 1283 in 2020. In 2018, 702 cybercrime offences were registered in the state. Of the 1,283 cyber crimes registered in 2020, 875 were of fraud. “Before the pandemic, digital transactions were not very popular. But Covid pushed people to go for contactless payment and many started placing online orders to avoid venturing out of their home. This volume of digital transactions gives an opportunity to cyber frauds,” said Jaydeepsinh Jadeja, DCP (crime). “The conmen started duping people who were new to digital payment methods and hence the cyber fraud offences went up in 2020. The digital transactions are completely safe if people follow the guidelines and not fall for the fraud calls,” Jadeja told TOI. Some of the most common cyber fraud cases were unknown persons making fake social media profiles of some eminent person and seeking money from his or her online friends. Also, the many got duped by the cyber frauds who posed as defence personnel looking for rental accommodation and siphoned money online. “Cybercrime cases have increased as people have taken to digital monetary transactions and the internet too has become cheaper. We educate people about the precautions they should take while making digital transactions through social media and awareness programs,” said Dr Sudhir Desai, superintendent of Vadodara Rural police. He added that the victims now immediately approach police due to which they have been able to prevent transfer of money in the fraudsters’ bank accounts or reverse the transactions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/cyber-crimes-spiked-64-during-covid-19-pandemic/articleshow/86240764.cms||Tushar Tere

This was partially also helped by some new funds that domestic MFs had launched during the year. From Rs 5,808 crore as of end-March 2020, total foreign assets of Indian fund houses jumped to Rs 20,865 crore by end-March 2021, data released by the RBI showed. Net foreign liabilities of Indian fund houses, however, showed a rise of just 28% during FY21 to Rs 85,267 crore. There are several MF schemes in India that invest in stocks listed abroad and the trend has suddenly picked up in the last couple of years. These include pure equity funds that invest part of their corpus abroad, and also international funds that invest abroad through the fund of funds (FoF) and exchange-traded fund (ETF) structure, thematic funds, country-specific funds, etc. Geographical diversification, strong market rally in the past few years and appreciation of foreign currencies against Indian rupee are among the most compelling reasons for Indian investors to put their money in these funds, industry players said. In addition, a negative correlation between the Indian market and those abroad could also be a reason for Indian investors to put their money there, the sources added. According to the RBI, most of the money invested by Indian MF investors abroad is concentrated in two countries — the US, which accounts for 43.3% of the total corpus, while 42.5% is in Luxembourg. The balance is distributed between Ireland, Japan, Canada and several other countries. The central bank’s data also showed that the total liability of Indian MFs increased in FY21 by about 46% to nearly Rs 1.1 lakh crore. These liabilities are mainly in the form of units issued to non-residents. Together, this led to a net liability of Rs 85,267 crore by end-March 2021 — a rise of about 28% over FY20 figures. Among the dedicated international funds, Motilal Oswal MF’s Nasdaq 100 ETF is the biggest with a corpus of Rs 5,125 crore, data from Value Research showed. Other large ones include Franklin Templeton’s US Feeder fund (Rs 3,919 crore), Motilal Oswal MF’s Nasdaq 100 FoF (Rs 3,631 crore) and Motilal Oswal S&P 500 index fund (Rs 2,058 crore). In recent months, Mirae MF, IDFC MF, Kotak MF, Axis MF, BNP Paribas MF, SBI MF and HSBC MF launched international funds. Currently, HDFC MF is set to launch its Developed World Indexes FoF — its first dedicated international fund. As the name suggests, this fund will invest in stocks in countries like the US, Canada, Europe, Japan, Australia & New Zealand, Singapore and Hong Kong, brochures from the fund house showed. These markets have very low correlation with India and, since they are diversified across several geographies, it would have low volatility. The fund’s benchmark is the MSCI World Index.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/wealth/nri/indian-mfs-global-fy21-kitty-jumps-3-6x-to-rs-21k-cr/articleshow/86245260.cms||---
---||Patna||Centre allows Bihar to raise Rs 1,699 crore from market||PATNA: The department of expenditure (DoE) under the Union finance ministry has allowed the Bihar government to raise Rs 1,699 crore through market borrowing, as it has met the target of achieving 15% of the capital expenditure that had been earmarked for the first quarter of the current fiscal. The amount will be incrementally increased during the remaining three quarters. As the statement released by the DoE on Tuesday said, Bihar was among the 11 states which had met the target of achieving 15% of the expenditure earmarked under the capital expenditure head of the budget pertaining to the first quarter of 2021-22. On account of this, the 11 states have been allowed, as an incentive, an opportunity to raise Rs15,721 crore overall through market borrowing from financial institutions. The money so raised will be spent as capital expenditure for the creation of assets like bridges, hospitals and other infrastructural entities, as well as to meet the costs of loan repayment and other such expenditures. This has been done after the first review of the capital expenditures made by the respective state governments. Subsequently, the reviews will be made in December to assess the capital expenditure made till September, followed by that in March next year, and finally in June. The Centre allows the states to raise money from the open market, but the cap on the total amount that can be raised in a financial year is 4% of the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP). During the 2021-22 budget presented in the state assembly on February 22, the estimated GSDP was put at over Rs7.57 lakh crore. The estimated outlay for capital expenditure for the creation of assets and loan repayment was Rs41,231 crore, including Rs30,786 crore for expenditure on the creation of productive assets, sources said. In his recent meeting with Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, state’s deputy CM Tarkishore Prasad, who also holds the finance portfolio, had argued for increasing the cap on market borrowing for Bihar from the existing 4% of the GSDP to 5%. The Centre has attached conditions for the continued raising of the money from the open market: That the states will have to meet the target of at least 15% capital expenditure during the first quarter (April to June), 45% during the second quarter (July to September), 70% during the third quarter (October to December) and 100% by the fourth quarter (January to March 31). Bihar and the states concerned will be allowed to raise money in an incremental manner over the current fiscal in consonance with the achievement made in the subsequent quarters. Yet, if it is found at the final review in June next year that the targets fixed were not actually met during the four quarters of the fiscal, then it would have the bearing on the raising of money through market borrowing by a state government concerned during 2022-23, as the incentive allowed will be adjusted, or pruned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/centre-allows-bihar-to-raise-rs-1699-crore-from-market/articleshow/86239941.cms||Abhay Singh
---||India||Cruelty by kin 30% of 3.7L ‘crime against women’ cases||NEW DELHI: A significant 30% (over 1.11 lakh) of the total cases of crimes against women in the pandemic year when there was much concern over women struggling with domestic violence and abuse, pertain to cruelty by husband or his relatives. The data on rape cases is equally worrying as the NCRB Crime in India 2020 report shows that there were 28,046 incidents of rape involving 28,153 victims and 2,655 were below the age of 18 years with 291 of them below 12. There were 219 incidents of murder with rape or gangrape involving 226 victims. The report shows that the percentage for crime categories for cruelty by husband and his relatives is almost the same as in 2019 when they accounted for 30.9% of all crimes against women. Similarly, the report shows that the trend on cases of rape which accounts for 7.5% of total cases in 2020 was similar to 2019 when 7.9% of all cases were that of rape. These figures are telling, given that the overall cases of crime against women reflect a decline of 8.3% from over 4.05 lakh cases in 2019 to around 3.71 lakh cases in 2020. Data also shows that the crime rate registered per lakh women population at 56.5 in 2020 is not just lower in comparison with 62.3 in 2019 but also lower than what it was at 58.8 in 2018. Hence amid this decline, the fact that cases of cruelty by husband and his relatives continued to hold the maximum chunk of crimes against women is a matter of concern. The next big categories of crimes relate to “assault on women with intent to outrage her modesty’ at 23% and kidnapping and abduction of women at 16.8%. In 2019, the percentage of cases for both these categories was 21.8% and 17.9% respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cruelty-by-kin-30-of-3-7l-crime-against-women-cases/articleshow/86248680.cms||Ambika Pandit
---||Dehradun||Lt Gen Gurmit Singh takes oath as Uttarakhand governor||Dehradun:Lieutenant general Gurmit Singh (retired) was sworn in on Wednesday as the new governor of Uttarakhand. He is the eight governor of the Himalayan state since it was carved out from UP in 2000. The oath of office and secrecy was administered to the new governor by chief justice of the Uttarakhand high court, RS Chauhan, at a ceremony held at Raj Bhawan. The function was attended by chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, his cabinet colleagues, senior Army officers, and several others. Lt Gen Singh is a former deputy chief of Army staff and is considered an expert on China and Pakistan issues. He served in the Indian Army for almost four decades before retiring in 2016. He also commanded the strategic XV Corps that overlooks the Line of Control in Kashmir. Lt Gen Singh succeeds Baby Rani Maurya, who resigned two years before completing her tenure. Talking to media persons, the new governor expressed his commitment to the development of the state. “After serving the country as a soldier, I feel proud to have got the opportunity to serve Uttarakhand, which is also called 'Veerbhoomi' as almost every family here has someone serving in the armed forces,” Singh said. He added that addressing issues related to ex-servicemen, soldiers who lost their lives in the line of duty and their dependents will be among his priorities. “I will do my best to live up to the expectations of people of the state from the governor's office,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/lt-gen-gurmit-singh-takes-oath-as-uttarakhand-governor/articleshow/86239894.cms||Gaurav Talwar
---||Thiruvananthapuram||CPM branch-level panel meets begin in all districts||Thiruvananthapuram: The organisational meeting of CPM was set in motion with the beginning of branch panel meetings in all districts but Kannur on Wednesday. The meeting of the basic organisational committee began in Kannur where the Marxist party has the highest number of branch panels had begun on September 10. The CPM organisational meet was originally supposed to take place in 2020, but it was put off following the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic and the emergencies that followed. Kannur has been chosen as the venue for CPM’s 23rd party conference. The party has close to 35,000 branch panels across the state. The state leadership has given strict instructions to conduct party conferences by adhering to Covid-19 protocol. The CPM district conferences would be held from December 10 to January 30. CPM acting state secretary A Vijayaraghavan had earlier this month announced the schedule of the district committee meetings. The party congress date is yet to be announced. The district conference schedule is as follows: Kannur (Dec 10-12), Ernakulam, Wayanad (Dec 14-16), Pathanamthitta, Malappuram (Dec 27-29), Kollam, Palakkad (Dec 31-Jan 2), Idukki (Jan 4-6), Kozhikode (Jan 10-12), Thiruvananthapuram, Kottayam (Jan 14-16), Thrissur, Kasaragod (Jan 22-23), Alappuzha (Jan 28-30). The party congress at Kannur is expected to redraw several of political lines and policies of CPM and it would also underscore the invincibility of Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan in the party, especially since the LDF government led by him retaining power in the state, braving a spate of allegations. The flow of disgruntled leaders from the Congress party to CPM is also seen as a handiwork of the party in the run-up to the state conference. The state conference is supposed to devise new strategies to keep the Congress-led UDF out of power and retain the political hegemony of CPM and the Left by shoring up support of all anti-Sangh Parivar elements in the state. Owing to age-related illness, V S Achuthanandan is unlikely to be part of the party conferences, first time since the inception of the party in 1964.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cpm-branch-level-panel-meets-begin-in-all-districts/articleshow/86244853.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Though the rate of daily vaccination fell drastically on Wednesday, it was enough to take the number of fully vaccinated to more than nine lakh, which is 25% of Lucknow’s 36 lakh adult population eligible for vaccination. September has been witnessing 40,000 vaccinations daily on average, but it dropped to 14,000 on Wednesday as most resources of health department were diverted for routine immunisation of kids. The routine immunisation has been lagging the target since April, because of the ravaging second wave and the priority given to Covid vaccination. Of those vaccinated on Wednesday, around 59.4% (8,419) people took the first shot, while 40.7% (5,781) got the second. This took the total number of people who have completed the two-dose course of vaccine to 9.2 lakh and single dose beneficiaries to 13.9 lakh. A person becomes eligible for the second dose eight to 16 weeks after taking the first. This gap between the two doses depends on the brand of the vaccine. 14,170, including 5,321 women, get jabs:Total 14,170 people, including 5,321 women, were vaccinated on Wednesday at 66 booths, including 29 private hospitals. Highest 10,161 beneficiaries were in the 18-44 age group followed by 2,694 aged between 45-59 years and 1,188 elderlies.

---||Meerut||Split from Corbett 21 yrs ago, UP gets New Corbett in Amangarh||Bijnor: When Uttarakhand was carved out in 2000, the Amangarh side of the Jim Corbett National Park remained part of UP. It was designated as a tiger reserve in 2012 but remains dependent on the Corbett reserve for poaching surveillance, wildlife veterinarians and rescue centres. It has none of its own. Now, the Amangarh Tiger Reserve is being renamed as the New Corbett Tiger Reserve, with a fresh development plan in the works. “The decision was taken on Tuesday. We have received instructions from higher authorities through videoconferencing on Wednesday,” said Bijnor DFO M Semmaran. On Tuesday, the first meeting of the Dudhwa Tiger Conservation Foundation, set up by the state to oversee Dudhwa, Amangarh and Pilibhit reserves in 2018, had approved the plan. State minister for environment, forest and climate change Dara Singh Chauhan had said the reserve should be developed the way others have. “Infrastructure development will take place now,” Semmaran said. “If things go well, Amangarh will have a rescue centre, a training centre and towers to keep vigil.” Over the past two decades, Amangarh, a buffer zone for Corbett, has remained largely neglected because of limited funding. So, despite several proposals to develop the reserve as a tourist spot, nothing moved forward. Its wildlife, meanwhile, was booming. “In 2013, it had just 13 tigers. Now, it has 27,” former Bijnor DFO Saleel Sharma told TOI. “The number of elephants has also gone up from 33 to 105 in the same period.” The reserve will be developed for eco-tourism. “It will help locals with jobs,” Semmaran said. “Tourist accommodation will come up. Eco-development committees will be formed and locals can work as cooks, waiters, guides and drivers,” Semmaran added. Officials said there are 15 villages around the Amangarh reserve, all of them in remote areas with few basic facilities. If the area becomes a tourist spot, the villages can expect better roads and, eventually, schools, said Ram Singh, who lives at Keharipur village. “Forest officials will also get more staff and technology here to manage human-animal conflict,” an official said. Bijnor has two forest divisions with 11 forest ranges over 50,000 hectare — 14,415 hectares is within the Bijnor division, including Amangarh, and the rest is under the Najibabad division. “About 1,000 hectares of forest land has been encroached on by the Van Gujjars and farmers in Amangarh,” said another forest official. The pastoralist Van Gujjar community is a nomadic one, which rears cattle and grazes them on forest land. While Uttarakhand has begun to rehabilitate forest tribes from Corbett, UP has not. Sharma said, “Encroachment is going up. So, it is important that Amangarh be extended because big cats and wild animals are thriving."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/split-from-corbett-21-yrs-ago-up-gets-new-corbett-in-amangarh/articleshow/86239870.cms||Harveer Dabas

While some of them won prizes, all the entries were displayed in an exhibition near the puja room where the society’s Ganapati idol is placed. Residents could come at their convenience for a darshan and look at the exhibition as well,” said Srinivas Deshpande of F residences, Wadgaonsheri. Jyothi Anand, a resident of Sunshree Kangan, NIBM Road, said, “We kept the idol for five days. Some residents took the idol around the premises in a procession before the visarjan, which took place in our parking area. Everybody wore masks and maintained social distancing throughout. Residents who did not come down, peered from their windows and balconies and cheered us on. We immersed the clay idol in a tub at the parking lot.” Jagdish Gujar, a resident of Yash Sankul cooperative housing society, Pimple Saudagar, said, “As opposed to no celebration last year, the tradition of a family donating an idol for Ganeshotsav has resumed this year. The idol was placed at the permanent Ganapati temple on the premises. Earlier, there used to be a huge procession but this time a few residents will take the idol for immersion on the tenth day.” Hemant Samtani, a resident of Clover Acropolis, Vimannagar, said, “We invited residents to come out of their home and join the celebration in a restrained manner.

The number of victims involved was close to 1.34 lakh. Though the number of incidents reflects a 13.5% decline from over 1.48 lakh cases in 2019, the classification of the crimes under different heads reflects how a very large number of children became victims of heinous crimes. Kidnapping and abduction cases accounted for 42.6% of all cases last year, followed by cases of sexual offences including child rape under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (Pocso) at 38.8%. Pocso cases accounted for 35.5% of the total in 2019. The number os offences under Pocso, pertaining to penetrative sexual assault and aggravated prenetrative sexual assault, shows that of the total 28,065 cases in these categories, in 96% of cases the accused was a known person. Out of 26,934 cases involving a known person, the offender was a family member in 2,556 cases. The age profile of the victims of sexual offences in 2020 shows that 640 were below six years, 2,540 between 6 to 12, as many as 11,029 between 12 to 16 and 14,118 between 16 to 18. These include both boys and girls. The NCRB data shows that in 2019 there was an increase of 4.5% in the total number of cases of crimes against children in the previous year in which 1,41,764 cases were registered. In percentage terms, major crime heads during 2019 in case of children were were kidnapping & abduction (46.6%) and Pocso cases (35.3%) including child rape.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/over-1-28l-crimes-against-kids-recorded-in-2020-ncrb-data/articleshow/86248718.cms||Ambika Pandit

A significant percentage of the cases were related to violation of pandemic-related curbs on crowds and refusal to cooperate with cops on duty. Though Mumbai came in fourth among cities in terms of total cases lodged, with Delhi by far the No. 1 followed by Jaipur and Kochi, the report showed that if cases were seen per lakh of population, Mumbai’s rank was 14, while Nagpur and Pune within the state came in at No. 8 and No. 5 respectively. Worryingly, cyber offences increased, with Mumbai coming in at No. 3 after Bengaluru and Hyderabad, and though crimes against senior citizens dipped, the city was still second, after Delhi. Mumbai was also second in crimes committed by juveniles, which included cases of theft, assault and assault on women. Minors were also arrested on charges of voyeurism, sexual harassment, kidnapping and stalking. The number of IPC cases registered in Maharashtra rose by 15.5% to 3,94,017 as against 3,41,017 in 2019. While the state was placed eighth in terms of cases per lakh of population (318.6 cases), in terms of the overall share of crimes, Maharashtra came second after Tamil Nadu’s 8,91,700, recording 10% of total crimes, while Gujarat was third with 3,81,849 cases and Uttar Pradesh fourth with 3,55,110. In terms of crimes per lakh of population, Delhi was the No. 1 state, followed by Kerala. Within the state, Pune’s overall crime rate went up by 147.3% and Nagpur’s by 27.5%. On an average, the Mumbai police every day registered 138 different kinds of cases, said the NCRB report. Rape cases fell by 18.3% in the city to 322, but Mumbai was still second to Delhi, which recorded 967, and kidnap cases dropped by 44.2% to 1,173 but again, the city was second to Delhi’s 4,011. In cyber crime Mumbai recorded a 9.4% rise in cases (2,433 as against 2,225 in 2019). The major crimes reported in Mumbai were related to theft (6,234), causing hurt (4,126), forgery or cheating or fraud (3,348), rash driving (1,605), kidnap or abduction (1,173), obstruction (933), molestation (1,507), burglary (1,645), and robbery (718). The number of attempt to murder cases (348) rose in the city by 1.5%. Activists said one of the major reasons cases of kidnap and abduction had dropped was prompt action taken in registering cases. On crimes against senior citizens, Sion hospital dean Dr Suleman Merchant said the elderly were the softest targets for those eyeing easy money. Physically frail and emotionally vulnerable in the absence of an adequate support system, they often live alone. “The few that rely on house help are as much at risk of being targeted by them as they are of counting on them for assistance,” said Merchant. Former state DGP Pravin Dixit said it appears the police were over-occupied in responding to the coronavirus pandemic and did not pay enough attention to curbing crimes. But he said crimes against women, which were not being registered earlier, have are now being registered, so in actuality it is not an increase in crimes against women but an increase in registration of such offences. A police officer said the government has made it mandatory for cops to lodge a complaint and begin a probe immediately if a matter is related to minors. “There is no doubt some of the crimes have gone up, but this is because our force has been registering crimes efficiently,” the officer said. However, the number of cyber crimes shows prompt registration is not always the case. Though the NCRB report showed cyber offences rose by 9.4% in Mumbai during the pandemic in all of 2020, the actual status is that many cases have gone unreported and many written complaints were not converted into FIRs. Maharashtra has underplayed the problem and also shown no urgency in teaming up with the Centre to institute a helpline-cum-call centre to freeze or track flow of money stolen digitally.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-crimes-up-23-in-covid-yr-cyber-offences-growing/articleshow/86244965.cms||Narayan Namboodiri

Police said the trio sustained pellet injuries in their legs when the belt of the double-barrel gun of a guard at a bank broke when he was patrolling and, as a result, the gun fell on the ground and went off. The injured were rushed to the district hospital, where their condition is stated to be out of danger, said police. Police identified the injured as Rubina, Gaurav and Mannu, who had come to the bank for some transaction. Upon getting information, police teams from the Nagar Kotwali and the Civil Lines police station rushed to the spot and shifted the injured to the district hospital, and launched an investigation into the matter. The guard, Mehandi Hassan, was appointed by the bank through a recruitment agency a few months ago. Deputy superintendent of police Kuldeep Singh said, “We are questioning the guard. Further legal action is underway.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/another-accidental-fire-from-bank-guards-gun-leaves-three-injured/articleshow/86239940.cms||Mohd Dilshad

The CM also directed divisional commissioners, IG and DIG level officers to hold a meeting once in two months with trade and industry organisations. Saying that these meetings should be organised compulsorily, the CM explained that most problems can be resolved at the local level and therefore, can be addressed quickly. “Those that cannot be addressed locally should be referred to the administration. The CM added that officials should work towards this with a positive frame of mind,” said a government spokesperson. To improve ease of doing business, the CM said, it was also necessary to review the status of incentives being provided to investors for setting up industrial units in the state. “These incentives are being given to encourage investments in the state. To ensure that the system is working smoothly, the CM has said that all cases be reviewed to ensure that there are no bottlenecks,” the spokesperson||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ensure-quick-disposal-of-traders-issues-cm/articleshow/86247069.cms||---
---||Goa||Tar ball events may impact Goa fisheries||PANAJI: Goa’s coastline, which has been hit by one of the worst tar ball episodes in recent years, has been seeing an increase in the frequency of assault by the toxic material. Prolonged exposure to the carcinogenic crude oil could spell disaster for tiny benthic organisms, which are an integral part of the fish production chain. It took the beach cleaning work force a few days to clean up the muck, but the damage to marine life goes unevaluated and unchecked. “The maximum living organism diversity is found in the top five centimetres to 10cm of beach sand or intertidal zone. This is a beehive of activity and leached oil forms a microfilm on the sand surface, blocking the connectivity to the surface. Oil gets into filtering chambers or gills of the filterfeeding organisms, blocking their breathing activity,” chief scientist, biological oceanography, NIO, Baban Ingole said. The macrobenthic communities on shore, most of which spend a larger part of their life inside burrows in the sand, are a source of food for bigger fish. “Their invisibility below the sand may give rise to the misconception that the intertidal beach is a less productive zone,” a former NIO scientist Antonio Mascarenhas said. Ingole and Mascarenhas were among a team of NIO scientists who had recorded in a study 50 macrobenthic species in sandy stretches of Miramar more than a decade ago. “Now there may be even more. The 50 species included a dozen of edible molluscan species like kondoio (Donax) and tisreo (clams) in its sandy stretches,” Ingole said. The concentration of benthic communities is crucial for the beach ecosystem. “For every square centimetre, there will be about 33 to 85 individuals. Miramar is an estuarine sandy beach rich in benthic fauna, and for that matter, other beaches harbour crustaceans and bivalve molluscs, and some of them belong to the edible group,” Mascarenhas said. The climate change dynamics — rise in temperature, sea level and pollution — also hold harmful implications for benthic organisms. “A few hardy species adapting to changes may survive, while others may disappear,” Ingole said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rise-in-tar-ball-events-may-impact-goas-fisheries/articleshow/86244932.cms||Paul Fernandes
---||Lucknow||Nishad Party’s yatra for quota demand begins||Lucknow: The Nishad Party launched the month-long ‘Sankalp Samaj Utthaan Aarakshan Yatra’ from Lucknow on Wednesday. Aiming to cover 20,000 kms in a month, the yatra will culminate into ‘Sarkar Banao, Adhikaar Paao Maharally’ at Ramabai rally ground in the state capital on October 15. “The yatra will also remind the BJP of our demands related to granting of the Scheduled Caste (SC) status to Nishads and fixing of reservation quota in the state government jobs,” said Dr Sanjay Nishad, national president of Nishad Party. Nishads constitute about 18% of the population in the state. Nishad Party, the BJP ally, has been demanding reservation under the SC category in UP from the BJP government since the 2019 Lok Sabha election. In 2019, Dr Sanjay Nishad’s son, Praveen Nishad contested from Santkabirnagar on BJP ticket and won. But, the demand for reservation was not met. Time and again, the Nishad Party has insisted on being friends with the BJP. But that did not bring a union cabinet berth for Praveen Nishad when Prime Minister Narendra Modi expanded his cabinet in July. “Kurmis who are hardly 5% got five MP berths and Nishads with 18% population were ignored. Let’s see what happens in the state cabinet reshuffle. Will the Machhua community get representation or not,” Dr Sanjay Nishad had said. The Nishad Party chief had met union home minister Amit Shah and BJP president JP Nadda at least four times since June to discuss its prospects for the state assembly election but it did not bring a concrete outcome. “The core committee of the party will meet on October 15 in Lucknow to decide the next course of action,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/nishad-partys-yatra-for-quota-demand-begins/articleshow/86247074.cms||Neha Shukla

Rajni Singh, the lawyer Sanjay Singh's wife, had lodged a police complaint. The accident was reported on Tuesday evening when Sanjay was returning with his son Bittu on a bike. The lawyer's bike was hit by a speeding car allegedly driven by his younger brother Mudit Pratap Singh and three others. Police are now looking for the accused. In her complaint, Rajni alleged that Mudit was accompanied by Mayank Singh, Guddu and Rahul - all from the same village. Based on the complaint, the four were booked for murder at Bisharatganj police station. A police force has been deployed in Atarchedi village to maintain law and order. On Wednesday, Bisharatganj SHO Vijay Kumar said, “We have registered an FIR under the section of murder. The accused will be arrested soon.

---||India||Govt set to ease rules to enable NRI, OCI card holders to take their adopted child to country of residence||NEW DELHI: The government is set to notify new regulations to enable NRI and OCI card holders, who adopt under the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act 1956 (HAMA), to get a ‘no-objection’ certificate to take the child with them to their country of residence. The regulations will enable the Central Adoption Resources Authority (CARA), which executes inter-country adoptions under the Juvenile Justice Act, to give the NOC to allow the child adopted under HAMA to go abroad with the adoptive parents. Also NRI and OCI card holders will be treated at par in line with the home ministry guidelines. The move follows much debate and consultations over bridging the gaps and address this critical concern as there is no mechanism for inter-country adoption under HAMA. Since adoptions under HAMA are not covered under the JJ system, CARA the only authority for inter-country adoptions could not give an NOC as of now, a mandatory requisite under the Hague Convention. Due to this legal hurdle, NRI parents who have adopted under HAMA were unable to get an NOC and had to go to court to seek orders to take their child abroad. It is learnt that not only getting court orders takes long but pending cases add to the concerns of the parents. Only a Hindu, Buddhist, Jain or Sikh can adopt under HAMA. According to officials in the women and child development ministry, the new regulations will also address the security concerns and fear of trafficking in the garb of adoption, by setting out a detailed verification process of the family and a report on the same would be furnished to CARA within a month by the district authorities to execute the approval as is done in the case of adoptions under the JJ Act. Senior officials said this regulation will bridge the gap between JJ Act and HAMA in inter-country adoptions. In another regulation in the works linked to domestic adoptions, the ministry, based on feedback from state governments, plans to make changes that will allow prospective adoptive parents registered with CARA the preference to adopt from their home state and then from anywhere nationally. The states had highlighted this since the adoption process allows parents to adopt from any state and children at times get far removed from their roots and cultural milieu. Also a change is proposed in the priority list for prospective adoptive parents in waiting list where NRIs and OCIs will be treated at par in the same category.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-set-to-ease-rules-to-enable-nri-oci-card-holders-to-take-their-adopted-child-to-country-of-residence/articleshow/86248754.cms||Ambika Pandit

Four candidates from Ahmedabad and one from Surat are in the Top 100 AIR list. Ananth Kidambi was the topper from Gujarat with AIR of 10 followed by Raghav Ajmera (AIR 31), Parth Patel (AIR 55), and Dhir Banker (AIR 57). These four students are from Ahmedabad. Maurya Aryan S, also from Ahmedabad (AIR 295), said he has been placed in the 99.98th percentile for all the three subjects. “I am placed in the 100th percentile in mathematics. I got 285 marks overall. I used to study eight to ten hours daily. In the JEE Main, the maths papers are usually lengthy so I worked on physics and chemistry first,” Maurya said. “That helped me get enough time to complete maths later. I focused on the NCERT syllabus for organic and inorganic chemistry. I aim to clear JEE (Advanced) in October in a good percentile and wish to pursue computer science at IIT-Bombay.” More than 30,000 students had taken the exam of whom 6,000 qualified, said sources. “I started my preparation for JEE Main and Advanced two years ago when I was in Class 11. I am thankful to all my teachers and mentors for putting in so much effort in online teaching during the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Sahil Mehul Danayak of the city. His AIR is 170. He added: “Attending online classes was a blessing in disguise as I saved a lot of travelling time and used it fruitfully.” The country’s biggest engineering entrance exam, JEE Main-2021, was conducted on August 26, 27, and 31, and September 1 and 2 in 334 cities in India and abroad. There were 925 examination centres. In all, about 9.39 lakh took the examination held in the fourth phase of JEE Main. This year, 44 students have been placed in the 100th percentile and 18 share AIR 1. The National Testing Agency (NTA) announced the results.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/four-from-abad-in-indias-top-100/articleshow/86242709.cms||---
---||Meerut||Meerut reports its 1st scrub typhus case, dengue cases cross 100-mark||Meerut: Meerut reported its first case of scrub typhus. A 60-year-old woman, recently admitted in Ghaziabad hospital, was diagnosed with the bacterial disease which spreads to humans through bites of infected chiggers [larval mites]. The dengue cases in the city, meanwhile, have crossed the 100-mark. Twelve new cases were reported on Wednesday. The total dengue count in Meerut has now reached 134. The first dengue case in Meerut was reported on August 18. The health department claimed that among the 134 cases, 75 are active while the rest of the patients have recovered and been discharged. Divisional surveillance officer, Dr Ashok Tayal, told TOI that the case of scrub typhus was reported from Ghaziabad and the patient is undergoing treatment. “We are taking her status report daily. She is doing fine. Her family got her admitted in Ghaziabad hospital after she complained of a prolonged fever and fatigue,” he added. The chief medical officer (CMO), Dr Akhilesh Mohan, has issued a high alert in all the government and private hospitals to ensure proper reporting and treatment of viral cases. “To combat the rising infection, we have started a campaign where we are visiting every household and asking people about any recent symptoms of fever and also dengue-like symptoms. We have formed 1,800 teams to conduct larva surveys in 7.5 lakh houses in the city. Our target is to cover at least each home by the weekend,” the CMO said. The health department maintained that apart from government and private hospitals, even the CHCs and PHCs have been asked to remain on alert and do proper reporting of fever cases. “Even people should behave responsibly and report their symptoms to doctors, especially if they have a prolonged fever. They must avoid self-medication," he said. "We also request the residents to cooperate with our surveillance teams and let them do the survey properly,” the CMO added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/meerut-reports-its-1st-scrub-typhus-case-dengue-cases-cross-100-mark/articleshow/86240012.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Goa||Rising dough: Pao to cost Rs 5 from October 1 in Goa||PANAJI: The price of homedelivered traditional bread (pao) will go up by Re 1 and will cost Rs 5 per piece from October 1. The announcement was made by president of the all-Goa bakers and confectioners association, Margao, Peter Fernandes, and the all-Goa bakers’ association, headed by Agapito Menezes. Menezes said that a decision to this effect was taken at the executive committee held on September 5. The price of the traditional pao was last hiked from Rs 3 to Rs 4 back in August 2016. “Goan bakers are struggling to make ends meet. Ours is a different and unique business. The price of all raw materials has risen. There is no respect given to our profession,” Fernandes told TOI. Fernandes lamented the plight of traditional bakers and, in representations to the government, stated that the government has supported various traditional communities including fishermen, trawler owners, farmers, mining-affected persons, bus owners, coconut and cashew farmers, seafarers, etc, but not traditional bakers. Menezes said that it is unprofitable for most bakers to make exclusively bread, and around 40% have expanded to confectionery. Almost all the traditional breadmakers use firewood, and the association had several meetings with the government in the past seeking financial assistance to be able to upgrade their small bakeries, but after more than twenty meetings, nothing happened. Most of the businesses are being run by family members without upgradation or any welfare schemes, Menezes said. Fernandes, in a representation to the government, has demanded subsidised firewood, simplified single-window system to repair old bakeries, financial support for bakers after retirement, pension, special quota for recognising children of bakers in catering colleges, and subsidies on machinery, among others. He is also seeking the stoppage of bakers from neighbouring states who bring bakery products, including pao, to Goa, and the setting up of a corporation of bakers to help bakers with soft loans for machinery, modernised training, health and sanitation education, and degradation of old dilapidated bakeries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rising-dough-pao-to-cost-rs-5-from-oct-1/articleshow/86244975.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh cabinet finalizes paddy policy, to set up 4,000 purchase centres||LUCKNOW: Almost three months after the Centre announced a hike in the minimum support price (MSP) for paddy, the state cabinet on Wednesday finalised the paddy purchase policy for 2021-22. In June, the Union cabinet had increased the MSP of common paddy from Rs 1,868 to Rs 1,940 per quintal and of Grade A paddy from Rs 1,888 to Rs 1,960 per quintal. The state cabinet has fixed the target of procuring 70 lakh metric tonnes of paddy in 2021-22 marketing year. At least 4,000 centres will be set up for paddy purchase, of which 1,100 will be of marketing division of food and civil supplies department, 1,500 of UP Cooperative Federation (PCF), 600 of UP Cooperative Union Ltd (PCU), 200 of UP State Krishi Utpadan Mandi Parishad, 300 of UP Consumer Cooperative Union (UPSS) and 300 of the Food Corporation of India. The procurement will be done through PFMS portal and payment will be made to farmers within 72 hours. In case of Bareilly, Moradabad, Meerut, Saharanpur, Agra, Aligarh and Jhansi divisions, and Hardoi and Lakhimpur in Lucknow division, procurement will be done between October 1 and January 31, 2022. In case of Lucknow (Lucknow, Sitapur, Rae Bareli, Unnao), Chitrakoot, Kanpur, Ayodhya, Devipatan, Basti, Gorakhpur, Azamgarh, Varanasi, Mirzapur and Prayagraj divisions, procurement will be done from November 1 to February 28, 2022. According to the policy, the purchase centres will be kept open from 9am-5pm but the DMs will be authorized to make necessary changes in the opening and closing time of the centres according to local conditions. To facilitate farmers, purchase centres will remain open on all working days, except Sundays and gazetted holidays. The name and address of purchase centres, along with the MSP, will have to be displayed at a panchayat building/public places such as cooperative society, agricultural marketing centres, and seed and fertilizer sales centres. The centre will be geo-tagged with the help of Remote Sensing Application Centre (RSAC). Besides, the name and address of purchase centres of all the agencies in the district, location of the centre, and name and mobile number of the centre in-charge will be made available on the website of the district. The information will be made available to farmers at the time of registration through SMS. Paddy will be procured through biometric authentication of farmers through electronic point of purchase machines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cabinet-finalizes-paddy-policy-to-set-up-4k-purchase-centres/articleshow/86247086.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Pocso complaints high though overall crimes against kids drop in Mumbai: NCRB||MUMBAI: The city earned the dubious distinction of having the second highest number of crimes against children in the pandemic year of 2020. Over 2,200 such cases were registered in Mumbai, while Delhi had more than double the cases (5,256), according to data released by the NCRB. Mumbai also featured among the five cities that reported the most number of Pocso cases (922 in Mumbai). Pocso is a law that deals with sexual offences against children. “Very often, a high number of cases being reported could mean that people are coming forward to make complaints unhesitatingly and the registering of cases is happening correctly,” said activist Priti Patkar.  A child would make a disclosure when his/her family is accepting and he/she is not going to be blamed. “Where families are compassionate and empathetic, reporting of offences becomes high. Further, if the ecosystem of registration of offences is also friendly and trauma-informed, it would assure the victim that he/she has done the right thing by making a disclosure,” she added.  If a victim is in a hostile environment, he may keep suffering but not make a disclosure. NCRB data also revealed that in 99% of rape cases in Maharashtra, the accused was known, such as a friend, neighbour, family member, live-in partner or someone befriended online. Activists agreed that not only in sexual offences but in cases of human trafficking as well, the accused is rarely a stranger.  The perpetrator is either an old acquaintance or someone who initiates a friendship and builds trust before the offence is perpetrated. “The fact that the culprit is known also affects the victim’s decision to seek legal recourse,” said an activist. Overall, registration of crimes against women in Mumbai decreased by 29% from 6,519 cases in 2019 to 4,583 cases in 2020. Reporting of crimes against children also reduced by 38% in the same period. NCRB data showed that conviction rates for crimes against women were low last year -- 39% in Mumbai and only 15% in the state.  Police officials said the pandemic had impacted functioning of courts and scheduling of hearings was often delayed, which could be one of the reasons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-pocso-complaints-increase-as-reporting-of-cases-down/articleshow/86245036.cms||Nitasha Natu
---||Goa||I can only give my best in training and hope to convince the coach: Nemil||Panaji: The referee was ready to blow the whistle and signal half-time, but Muhammed Nemil had other ideas. Collecting the ball just past the centre, the FC Goa midfielder worked his way towards the Sudeva Delhi FC goal, shadowed all along by his marker. When he reached outside the box, it was time to make a decision. “I had some space to dribble and I thought I’ll try to shoot with my right (foot) but there was no space,” Nemil told TOI during an online interaction on Thursday. “So I changed my direction to the left and just tried (shooting).” The result was stunning. Nemil’s curler sailed into the top corner of the net. It was a goal of butterfly beauty. But while those who had seen him train and play friendlies with Goa knew what he could do with the ball at his feet, for everyone else, this was as good an introduction as it could get. Within minutes, social media was buzzing. “Right now, I am not really looking at the messages that are coming through social media. That’s not important, though I am really happy and thankful for all those who have sent positive messages,” said Nemil. Since cutting short his stint in the lower divisions of Spain and returning to Goa – who signed him from the Reliance Foundation Young Champs Academy in Mumbai last year – the 19-year-old from Kozhikode has been under fair bit of scrutiny. He is now beginning to live up to his reputation. “I had a chat with the coach in Spain and he was telling me about the challenges and competition I will encounter here in FC Goa,” said Nemil, who was tracked by scouts in Spain last year and reports sent to coach Juan Ferrando. When in Barcelona, Ferrando’s first mission was to see Nemil play. He couldn’t as the youngster was nursing an injury. “I had a meeting to explain our methodology, our targets. Nemil is very hardworking. He is young. I will always try and find the best lineup; if he’s ready, he will be included (in the starting 11), or he will be among the substitutes. At the moment, his performance is good.” He will have to do even better to cement a regular spot. In his position, Nemil is up against the likes of Alberto Noguera – winner of the highest assists last season – and, if Jorge Ortiz continues on the left wing, Brandon Fernandes, arguably the best that India has to offer. Princeton Rebello, Edu Bedia and Glan Martins would be additional competition, if Ferrando decides to switch to a 4-3-3 formation. Nemil, though, is not worried. “The only thing I can do to get game time is give my best in training sessions and try to convince the coach,” said Nemil. For now, he’s hardly put a foot wrong, whether in training, friendlies or competition. He has enough support from his teammates too; Noguera spends considerable time after training to explain him the importance of positional awareness. Others chip in too, while Glan Martins is his go-to man on the field. “I am really happy that I joined FC Goa,” said Nemil. “The culture and everything is really good here. The coach and some players are from Spain. They are really helpful. In fact, the whole team has been of great help.” Nemil has played his part too, giving Ferrando a happy headache before the Indian Super League (ISL) kicks off in November.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/i-can-only-give-my-best-in-training-and-hope-to-convince-the-coach-nemil/articleshow/86273310.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

Officials said this supplementary chargesheet is against Kundra and Thorpe. Kundra’s brother-in-law Pradeep Bakshi and one Yash Thakur have been shown as absconding accused in the chargesheet. Police said in the supplementary chargesheet they have attached details of the exchange of emails and WhatsApp chats between Kundra and the other accused, 24 hard disks containing pornographic material seized from Kundra’s office, Andheri bank details of his firms and details of the Hotshot app. Kundra’s name had surfaced in July this year after the crime branch’s property cell probing the case stumbled upon the involvement of a UK-based production company Kenrin and police arrested its executive Umesh Kamat in the case. Kamat, a former employee of Kundra, is accused of uploading at least seven to eight “porn and obscene” videos allegedly shot by Gehana Vasisth on a social media app for monetary consideration. Police suspects that Kundra has a stake in Kenrin and was involved in production and distribution of pornography material.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-supplementary-chargesheet-filed-against-kundra-it-head/articleshow/86245076.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Kolhapur||Around 38,000 get jabbed across Kolhapur district||Kolhapur: Around 38,000 people across Kolhapur district were vaccinated against Covid-19 on Wednesday. Since the start of the Ganeshostav, the average daily turnout of beneficiaries had dipped to 18,000 and this had the administration worried. The administration had received over 1.25 lakh doses of Covishield a couple of days ago and the increase in the turnout has relieved the authorities. On September 10, 1.92 lakh doses were administered but between September 11 and 14, only 43,000 jabs were administered in Kolhapur district as per CoWIN portal dashboard. Yogesh Sale, district health officer of Kolhapur zilla parishad, said, “Increase in turnout has relieved us. We had expected a dip during the festival as citizens prefer to stay home and enjoy. Now that the household Ganesh festival has ended we expect the turnout to increase.” So far, 19.68 lakh citizens from Kolhapur district have received their vaccination, out of which 8.46 lakh have received both the jabs. The increase in the first jab is due to opening of vaccination slot for younger population. Also, the administration has done away with mandatory pre-registration through online portal for getting the jabs. The authorities claim that the spot registration of the beneficiaries has helped increase turnout especially among women and rural population. Meanwhile, as many as 1.41 lakh doses were administered in Sangli district on Wednesday till 7.30 pm , highest daily jabs in one day.

The court has also directed the electricity and water departments to disconnect electricity supply and water supply, and directed Alex Fernandes and Lavita Fernandes to vacate the premises and the panchayat to seal it. “The photographs on record and the site inspection referred to in the panchayat’s resolution clearly bear out this position,” the bench said. “This is a case where an entirely new structure was put up by the respondents without obtaining permission from any authorities in an eco-sensitive CRZ area, taking advantage of the fact that all authorities were busy combating the Covid-19 pandemic.” “The seals can be removed only to facilitate the demolition if the respondents (Alex and Lavita) seek to demolish the structure by themselves,” the court held. The division bench comprising Justices M S Sonak and M S Jawalkar stated that the petition “highlights an extremely disturbing feature as to how constructions are put up in CRZ areas without bothering to obtain any permissions from any authorities, and thereafter, some sort of immunities are claimed based on the completion of such construction at breakneck speeds by taking advantage of the circumstance that the enforcement was lax because enforcement agencies were battling the pandemic.” The petition was filed by fisherman and social activist Alex Fernandes, who was represented by advocate Rohit Bras de Sa with V Shet. “According to us, this is a brazen violation of the law, and the legal provisions in the matters of putting up constructions in a panchayat area and that too in a CRZ area. Respondents (Alex and Lavita) are firmly convinced that as long as they race to complete the illegal construction and occupy the same, the law will never be able to catch up with them. The attempt thereafter is to institute all sorts of proceedings and delay the action against the wholly unauthorised construction put up in an eco-sensitive zone without seeking permissions from any authorities,” the court held, adding that they have occupied the premises in the absence of an occupancy certificate. “These respondents were aware that no occupancy certificate could be issued to such an unauthorised structure because it was put up without any permissions, possibly at a site where no permissions could even have been granted by the panchayat.” The court also directed the duo to deposit with the panchayat a certain amount within three days, which will be refunded if they demolish the structure themselves. “If the structure is not demolished by the respondents, they will have to bear the expenses concerning the demolition,” the court stated after the advocate general submitted that the demolition squad has to spend Rs 5-6 lakh to demolish this kind of structure. “The GCZMA should also visit the site and determine the damage to the environment on account of putting up such a structure in the CRZ area. Ultimately, the respondents will have to make good the loss which they have caused to the environment by putting up a brazen, illegal, and unauthorised structure without permission from any authorities whatsoever in a CRZ area. This exercise must be completed within six weeks from today,” the court said. “The state to provide police assistance for implementation of our order. If the two respondents resist any authorities, including police authorities, action in terms of the law will have to be initiated against them,” the bench further said. The court noted that none of the authorities were prompt in taking action against the respondents, as a result of which they completed the construction within four to five months, named it ‘Typsy Villa’ and entered into the same.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/villa-built-in-hurry-during-pandemic-to-be-razed-in-10-days/articleshow/86245081.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Amethi to witness real ‘dangal’ ahead of UP polls||Lucknow: The high-stakes electoral combat in Uttar Pradesh is less than six months away, but a real ‘dangal’ will be fought in Amethi — the seat wrested by Union minister Smriti Irani from Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in 2019 general elections — on September 17, the 71st birthday of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The three-day event is being organised by National Wrestling Federation headed by BJP’s Gonda MP Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh as its president. Sources said Irani is scheduled to reach Amethi on Thursday evening and will stay all through the event. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath and deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya are also expected to attend the event. The championship showcasing BJP’s ‘Khelo India’ initiative will be organised in Sainik School campus at Gauriganj in Amethi district. “Preparations are in full swing and about 550 wrestlers in the 12 to 23 age group from across the country will participate in the event,” said BJP spokesperson in Amethi, Govind Chauhan. Famous wrestlers including Phogat sisters, Geeta and Babita, and Bajrang Punia, who won the bronze medal at his Olympic debut after beating Kazakhstan’s Daulet Niyazbekov, are expected to attend the event. Sources said the event is the brainchild of Smriti Irani who wanted to organise the championship in her constituency and had recently sent her representative Vijay Gupta to oversee the preparations and submit a report. The wrestling championship, the biggest sporting event ever organised in Amethi, is part of BJP’s initiative to connect with youth. Earlier, in 2018, Irani had organised a cricket championship in Amethi, and was seen to have paid off as she went on to defeat Rahul Gandhi in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/amethi-to-witness-real-dangal-ahead-of-up-polls/articleshow/86247104.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolhapur||Neeraj Chopra’s Olympic gold inspires Kolhapur mandals||KOLHAPUR: The Indian contingent’s success at the Tokyo Olympics inspired the themes of many Ganesh pandals in the city this year. Ganesh as a javelin thrower — a nod to Olympic gold medalist Neeraj Chopra — was a popular concept. As the police have prohibited live acts and moving sets, which usually create a buzz among people, the Ganesh mandals have had to improvise and innovate. Mahesh Dhavale, the head of the Sarvoday Mitra Mandal in Ravivar Peth area, said, “We made our idol a javelin thrower, much like Neeraj Chopra, so that more youngsters can take inspiration and pursue sports. Other sports and sportspersons, apart from cricket and cricketers, should also get recognition. Our set was inaugurated on Wednesday by Olympic shooter Tejaswini Sawant.” The pandal got their made-to-order idol from Gorakhnath Kumbhar of Ichalkaranji. Another pandal too has a javelin-thrower idol. Rushikesh Jadhav, a member of the Soldiers’ Group at Toraskar chowk in Juna Budhwar Peth area, said, “Every year we create Ganesh idols to give out a social message. This year, we took inspiration from Neeraj Chopra as a tribute to all the sports persons who brought glory to the nation. The government should promote sports and provide facilities and funding so that we can get more medals in the Olympics. We bought the idol from Sandip Kumbhar of the Kalamba area.” Covid vaccination drive-based decorations were also common. In some pandals, Ganesh was shown as a medical professional administering vaccines. Nilesh Hankare, the head of Mhasoba and Biroba Devalay Trust in Shaniwar Peth area, said, “To honour the frontline and medical workers and to promote the vaccination drive, we got an idol in the form of a doctor giving the Covid-19 vaccine to a child. With this, we also wanted to demand the vaccination of children so that the offline schools can reopen. The idol was Amar Kumbhar from the Kadamwadi area.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/neeraj-chopras-olympic-gold-inspires-kolhapur-mandals/articleshow/86237852.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

As widespread speculation persisted that a ‘no-repeat’ formula will be adopted for the new council of ministers, supporters of a number of former ministers staged protests in their respective constituencies. Supporters of former Dy CM Nitin Patel and ministers Kunvarji Bavaliya, Dilip Thakor, Jawahar Chavda and others staged protests in their respective constituencies. Many supporters of ministers in the Vijay Rupani government also took to social media, warning the BJP leadership that the party would suffer electoral setbacks if ministers were dropped. Social media continued to remain inundated with posts reacting to the ‘no-repeat’ formula of the BJP leadership. Workers took down postersMeanwhile, most ministers vacated their chambers in Swarnim Sankul in Gandhinagar, packing up their personal belongings like books, decorations, and other items. Some of the ministers in the Vijay Rupani cabinet even began packing up their belongings in ministerial bungalows, as speculation of the ‘no repeat’ formula spread thick and fast across the state. Meanwhile, the opposition Congress took a dig at the situation that the BJP has found itself in. “The new formula for choosing ministers is that the person should have zero experience in governance and should be loyal to their masters. This is an assault on the self-respect of Gujaratis and BJP will pay for it dearly in next election,” said party leader Arjun Modhwadia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/stop-bickering-or-face-action-disgruntled-ministers-told/articleshow/86242775.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Demolish resort on govt land illegally built without nods, says HC||PANAJI: The high court of Bombay at Goa on Wednesday directed the North Goa collector to seal a resort in Siolim set up on government land without obtaining permission from Goa coastal zone management authority (GCZMA) “latest by tomorrow” (Thursday), and demolish it within four weeks. The court also rejected the contention that the respondents who built the resort were two Delhi businessmen who invested a considerable amount of money, and that they made further representations to the authorities even after the GCZMA's demolition order and the NGT dismissal of their petition. “The government land cannot be usurped or encroached upon or frittered away in this manner to assist (the two businessmen from Delhi) for their business activities. Similarly, the environment cannot be degraded in this manner by putting up a resort in the eco-sensitive CRZ area, without bothering to obtain any permissions from GCZMA,” stated the bench. “(The two Delhi businessmen) have taken their calculated chances, and now that their illegalities have been discovered, there is no question of any further indulgence,” the bench, comprising Justices M S Sonak and M S Jawalkar, said. The court “seriously doubted" whether the authorities even have the power to consider “representations of this nature”. “….this is a case where the orders made by the authorities record that the resort has been put up on government land, and over an eco-sensitive area affected by CRZ. In such circumstances, even assuming that there are any powers for regularisation, there would be no question of entertaining such representations,” the high court stated.“The government land cannot be usurped or encroached upon or frittered away in this manner to assist Respondent Nos 9 and 10 (the two businessmen from Delhi) for their business activities. Similarly, the environment cannot be degraded in this manner by putting up a resort in the eco-sensitive CRZ area, without bothering to obtain any permissions from GCZMA,” stated the division bench comprising Justices M S Sonak and M S Jawalkar. The high court directed the electricity and water departments to disconnect electricity and water supply to the resort forthwith, and directed other authorities to comply with GCZMA’s order for demolition and restore the government land to its original position within four weeks. It also directed that the penalty amount be paid, failing which steps will have to be taken by the collector to recover the penalty amount. The complainant, Alex Pereira, represented by advocate Nigel Da Costa Frias with Barbara Andrade, went to court stating that the GCZMA’s order dated November 5, directing the N Goa collector to reclaim government land to its original position at the earliest and recover penalty of Rs 5 lakh per structure was not being complied with. The petitioner complained that the respondents usurped government land, and without any permission from GCZMA, proceeded to construct a hotel/resort at Siolim. “Now, despite the order of the GCZMA attaining finality on account of dismissal of the appeal by the NGT, none of the statutory authorities took steps to either seal the structures or to demolish the same, so that the government land can be restored to its original position at the earliest. According to us, there is no explanation as to why this was not done,” the court observed. The state government told the court that the structures would be immediately sealed, but that four weeks may be given to carry out demolition and to restore the site to its original position. “This request, according to us, is quite reasonable,” the high court stated. The high court didn’t accept the contention of advocate Abhay Gupta, representing the businessmen from Delhi, who put up the hotel/resort by investing a considerable amount, that directions be issued to authorities to consider representations made to them. “According to us, this contention of Gupta cannot be accepted,” the court said. “Once the GCZMA has (issued) the order and the challenge against the order was turned down by the NGT, there is no question of (the businessmen-respondents) making any further representations to the deputy collector, GCZMA, or such authorities entertaining such representations.In any case, this is a matter where admittedly no permissions were obtained from the GCZMA even though a resort was put up in the CRZ area. Gupta himself has submitted that two respondents are businessmen and therefore, it is apparent that they are aware of the law which governs the putting up of hotels or resorts in the CRZ area."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/demolish-resort-on-govt-land-illegally-built-without-nods-hc/articleshow/86245114.cms||---

The accused men (all in their late 20s), hailing from Prayagraj, Pratapgarh and Rae Bareli, have been handed over to Delhi Police. However, later on Wednesday night, all three were released by Delhi Police. In a joint operation on Tuesday, UP ATS and special cell of Delhi Police had arrested three persons—Moolchand of Rae Bareli, Mohammed Amir of Lucknow, and Zeeshan Qamar of Prayagraj. Cops had also recovered an IED from their possession. Additional director general of police, law and order, Prashant Kumar said though the basic tip-off about the module was forwarded by Delhi Police about 10 days ago, the arrests were made on the basis of intelligence gathered and developed by UP ATS. “It was an onerous task to trace the suspects in view of back-to-back VIP visits to the state. We used our best Special Police Operation Team (SPOT) and nabbed six persons after scanning surveillance inputs for 10 days,” he said. Kumar added that the group was planning to execute serial IED blasts in the state. “Large congregations in major cities of UP during the upcoming festival season were the likely targets,” the officer said. “As the main case is related to Delhi Police, the suspects and the recovered case property has been handed over to them,” he added. Sources in the ATS said the main task of the suspects was to conduct reconnaissance of prime targets and then carry weapons to the location.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/isi-module-ats-nabs-3-more-terror-suspects/articleshow/86247133.cms||---

However, in reality, 58,000-plus complaints of online banking frauds have been filed with the Maharashtra state cyber cell in the last 12 months. This includes 14,000-plus complaints from Mumbai. The amount involved runs into several crores. Yet barely 600 cases have resulted in FIRs. Many applications have been turned into non-cognizable offences, which do not show up in crime statistics and are not probed unless a court order pushes for it. Cyber lawyer Dr Prashant Mali said cyber crimes, specifically financial and online abuse crimes, have increased manifold. Cyber expert Ritesh Bhatia said sextortion, cyberbullying, KYC frauds and customer helpline frauds have considerably increased. There is a lack of support by intermediaries such as the social media platforms, banks, digital payment providers and others in the ecosystem, resulting in delays that discourage both the cops as well as citizens, the experts said. Also, skilled cyber cops is another issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-over-14000-online-fraud-plaints-from-city-only-600-firs-filed/articleshow/86245174.cms||Narayan Namboodiri

All the accused pleaded not guilty to the charges of terrorism, criminal conspiracy, murder and destruction of evidence (see box). They said they should be tried after the court recorded their pleas. The court directed that the accused shooters, Sachin Andure and Sharad Kalaskar, be shifted from Aurangabad and Mumbai jails, respectively, to Pune’s Yerawada jail to ensure their presence during the trial. ENT surgeon Virendrasinh Tawde of Panvel, accused as the chief conspirator, is already in Yerawada. Vikram Bhave, accused of assisting the alleged shooters in a recce of the crime spot, and Mumbai lawyer Sanjeev Punalekar, accused of evidence destruction, are out on bail. “The trial will take some time to commence because an opportunity will have to be given to the accused, their lawyers as well as the prosecution to prepare themselves,” said judge Navander. The next hearing is scheduled for September 30 when the process of recording of evidence is expected to begin. Tawde, Andure and Kalaskar were produced via videoconferencing while Bhave and Punalekar were present in person and signed the recording of their plea. Earlier, the court turned down Tawde, Andure and Kalaskar’s plea to defer the framing of charges. The judge told them that their lawyers have argued at length on framing of the charges and the matter can’t be re-argued. Kalaskar, 29, who is lodged in Mumbai’s Arthur Road jail, has moved the Bombay high court, seeking a stay on the trial. His writ petition, filed through lawyer Jyoti Ghorpade, is at pre-admission stage, according to information uploaded on the high court’s website. Kalaskar, also an accused in the murder of Leftist leader Govind Pansare in Kolhapur in February 2015 and in an arms haul case in Mumbai, has sought a stay on the trial of these two cases pending before the Kolhapur and Mumbai sessions courts, respectively, too. He primarily takes exception to the fact that he was produced before the trial judges only twice between December 2019 and March 2020. His plea added that though the chargesheets were filed in 2015-16, no charges had been framed. All of a sudden, the Pune court was in haste to frame charges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/terror-murder-charges-framed-dabholkar-trial-to-start-sept-30/articleshow/86245256.cms||Asseem Shaikh

Elections are due in south, north and east municipal corporations in April 2022 and the AIMIM is preparing the ground to enter the fray from at least 70 seats out of the total 272 in the three civic bodies.  The AIMIM may contest in 35 to 40 seats in east Delhi and the remaining in north and south corporations. The BJP has been ruling the three corporations of Delhi for the last 15 years. AIMIM Delhi state president Kaleem Ul Hafeez told TOI that they were banking on Muslim-Dalit combination of votes to emerge as a political force in the national capital. The AIMIM is also planning to run for the mayor’s post by fielding a Dalit as its mayoral candidate in east municipal corporation of Delhi where population of Muslims and Dalits is 50 per cent. “Muslims are looking for an alternative. They are vexed with the Aam Aadmi Party. They do not want to vote for the BJP. They have lost confidence in Congress. Even Dalits have a soft corner for Owaisi,” Kaleem said. The Majlis party had drawn a blank in the Delhi municipal polls in 2017. Kaleem said Muslims want a leader from their own community and Owaisi fits the bill as a ‘pan-India leader’ of the minorities. He also said civic amenities were in a bad shape. “There are no primary schools. Muslims have bigger issues such as security and they are looking at Owaisi’s party to emerge as a major player in national politics,” Kaleem explained. Since May this year, the Majlis party has held 17 candlelight rallies and protests in support of minorities and Dalits. It is slated to hold a conference of 5,000 party workers drawn from various wards in the three municipal corporations.

---||Madurai||Explain project in GO itself: HC||Madurai: Observing that transparent governance is the ultimate aim of any government, Madras high court has suggested to the government to incorporate the reasons for the implementation of any project in the government order (GO) itself to ensure transparency. The court said this after taking into account that projects are delayed for years together resulting in escalation of the cost of the project due to pending litigations before courts.A division bench of justice N Kirubakaran (since retired) and justice B Pugalendhi observed that if the GOs explain the reasoning for the decisions, then probably the litigations would reduce. The reasoning in the note files of the department, to some extent, shall also be incorporated in the GOs itself so as to enable the common man to understand the object of the government in implementing a project.“One should understand that around 50% of the income of an average individual is collected by the government as tax, in the colour of income tax, sales tax, GST, road tax, wealth tax, etc. Every rupee of public money is accountable and the administrators are expected to spend the taxpayers’ money cautiously and they are answerable for every pie they spend,” observed the judges.The court made these observations while disposing of a batch of petitions filed with regard to the alignment of Karur ring road project and its approach road.The judges observed that courts are not experts in this field to make a decision as to which is the right or wrong alignment. It is for the authorities to decide the same. But, at the same time, public money cannot be spent detrimental to public interest.Taking into account that the alignment of the project was revised a few times, the judges observed that the transport planning should be in such a way to achieve safe, fast, comfortable, convenient, economic and environment-friendly movement of people and goods. Hence, the judges suggested the government to consider the earlier proposal as per GO passed in 2013 for the ring road and to consider the revised proposal as per 2019 GO for the approach road, after ascertaining the present day developments in that area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/explain-project-in-go-itself-hc/articleshow/86245155.cms||Kaushik Kannan

Jail officials said with the sale of the Ganesh idols, they earned a revenue of Rs 7,00,000. For the past few years, the inmates of the Nashik Road Central Prison have been preparing the Ganesh idols. These idols are put up for sale at the stall of the prison along the Jail Road. The idols prepared by the jail inmates are always in demand as they are made of Shadu clay and are eco-friendly. These can also be immersed at home. The price of these idols is also less as they do not compete with the other stall owners and do not look to make a profit, said the officials In 2017, the inmates had prepared 150 idols for the first time and had set up the stall. They were received with great enthusiasm. A year later, close to 1,000 idols were prepared while in 2019, 800 idols were made. Last year, due to the Covid outbreak and restrictions on celebrations, the number of idols was scaled down to 550. This year too, only 600 idols have been prepared.

---||Ahmedabad||HC notice on subsidy pullback||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court has issued notice to concerned state authorities in response to a petition challenging the government’s decision to withdraw the benefits of subsidy in solar energy policy for micro, small and medium enterprises on the ground that the stoppage of the policy is in violation of the principle of promissory estoppel. The high court was moved by a businessman from Mahisagar district, Ramanlal Patel, who submitted that he had invested in setting up a solar power project following the Gujarat Industrial Policy, 2020. He was attracted to invest in purchase of land, equipment and services to establish the solar project because of the subsidy policy for Development of Small Scale Distributed Solar Project, 2019. His unit was classified as micro enterprise. However, the government took a decision to withdraw the subsidy policy on July 20 and later communications were issued to concerned authorities in August. The petitioner has termed the decision to withdraw subsidy benefits for the MSMEs as illegal and invalid. He has argued that such a decision is against the principle of promissory estoppel. “Had there been no subsidy offered to xindustries, he would never have invested so much in this business,” he said. After preliminary hearing, Justice Sangeeta Vishen on Tuesday issued notice to the concerned authorities and sought their replies by September 28, when further hearing has been posted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-notice-on-subsidy-pullback/articleshow/86242820.cms||---

This is the third state team to visit the district in three weeks following the severe dengue outbreak resulting in 130 deaths, 99 of them children. The latest team will be led by state director of vector-borne disease GS Vajpayee. It will camp in Firozabad for a week and monitor patients at hospitals. At a meeting on Wednesday morning, the CM had directed officials that all necessary efforts should be made to make the hospitals equipped to face the challenge. Vacancies of doctors at hospitals of the health department should be looked into and specialist doctors must be sent, if necessary, the CM further directed. The CM also ordered to intensify cleanliness and fogging in the affected areas. Additional personnel will be deployed by the urban development department. Thirty-six critical patients are currently undergoing treatment at the 18-bed capacity emergency ward of the medical college and 459 others at designated wards for patients with dengue symptoms, sources said. Two-thirds of them are children. Additional director of the health department, AK Singh, said, “A 15-member team consisting of senior doctors, scientists and experts on vector-borne disease will be reaching Firozabad on Thursday. The team will look into the causes of deaths and will provide guidance during the treatment of patients, particularly children in critical condition." Singh added, “Over 100 teams of health staff have been tasked to conduct a door-to-door survey to identify the patients and provide them with medicines and required assistance. There is no shortage of platelets or required medicines at the government centres.” Ram Bahadur, a daily wager and a resident of Ramnagar locality who lost his six-year-old son suffering from high fever, said, “A private hospital in the city demanded Rs 25,000 in advance to start my child's treatment. I requested them to start the treatment and give me a day's time to arrange for the money. They refused. Later, I took my child to the medical college. Here, hospital staff could not admit my child as all the beds were full. I was told to take my child to Agra and I had arranged a private ambulance. My child died on the way.” Chief medical superintendent of Firozabad medical college, Dr Hansraj Singh, said, “No formal complaint has been received regarding the death of any patient. We are increasing the number of beds to accommodate more patients.” There are 64 active camps in the district and 5,000 people, including those who have fever, are undergoing treatment there, CMO Dinesh Kumar Premi said. Sources also told TOI that at least 12,000 people in the district are estimated to be bedridden with fever at home or in private hospitals. Last week, ICMR had reported an outbreak of DENV-2 serotype - a dengue strain - in Firozabad. Among children, dengue hemorrhagic fever is the major cause of fatality, health officials said, blaming the lack of sanitation and hygiene for its spread. District magistrate Chandra Vijay Singh said, “To check the spread of dengue and other vector-borne diseases, we are running a cleanliness campaign across the district. Water-logging is being cleared and people are asked to remove stagnant water in their homes. Anti-larval spraying is also being conducted in the affected areas. A control room has been set up at the district level and helpline numbers have been issued for time-bound action.” So far, over 600 cases of dengue have been confirmed in Firozabad district. A few cases of malaria, scrub typhus have also been reported.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/cm-sends-new-15-member-team-of-doctors-experts-to-firozabad/articleshow/86240192.cms||Deepak Lavania

Citizens had lodged complaints against the parking contractor for overcharging. “A showcause notice was served on him, but he didn’t reply within the deadline. So, a fine was imposed on him,” Sushmita Shirke, superintendent engineer, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), said in a notice. As per the notice, the tender terms made it clear that the parking fees have been fixed and staff must behave properly with the visitors. The standard rate at a public parking is Rs14 per hour for four-wheeler and Rs3 per hour for two-wheeler. “Citizens had complained that staff members of the parking lot at Budhwar peth were misbehaving with vehicle owners. They were threatening them with dire consequences if questioned regarding overcharging. So, action has been taken as per the contract terms”, said an official. “The reply of the notice was expected in seven days, but it has not been received. So, a fine has been charged based on the monthly revenue generation of the parking lot. As per the terms, Rs2.14 lakh (50% of the total monthly revenue) has been charged as fine. The PMC will take possession of the parking premises If complaints are received again from citizens,” the notice said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/parking-contractor-fined-rs-2-14-lakh-for-overcharging/articleshow/86245161.cms||---

---||Agra||Uttar Pradesh: Year after Hathras gang-rape & murder, dalit family says in worse shape||Hathras: A year since the dalit girl from Hathras, 19, was allegedly gang-raped and murdered by four upper caste men in her village, her family is trapped in its quest for justice. They have been under security cover the entire time, don’t step out unless they have to and have faced so much hostility that they sent the victim’s six-year-old niece to be brought up by her uncle in Firozabad. While they try to put the pieces of their lives back together, a part of the compensation, a job and a house — promised by the government — are yet to come their way because of an administrative “misunderstanding”. It was last month that they decided the elder brother’s daughter must go away. “Sending our girl to school is not safe here anymore. We did not want her to grow up in this environment. There is too much hostility and stigma,” said the younger brother. Upper caste families of the four accused — Sandeep Singh, Ramu Kumar Singh, Ravi Singh and Lavkush Sisodia — wield considerable influence over the village and seem to have garnered support for them. “It seems as if it is our fault somehow,” the brother added. Eight of them are left at home now — the victim’s mother, father, grandmother, two brothers, sister-in-law and two nieces. No one in the house has had a job in a year. “I lost my job last year. I can’t work with a six-man security detail around me all the time,” the younger brother said. It’s oppressive, they said, but there was no way around it. “There always was caste discrimination. It is worse now. We don’t step out unless absolutely necessary. We have even stopped going to the village market. For anything we need, we go to the Hathras market,” the brother said. “We are the ones in detention.” The family had said in October last year that it wants to move to Delhi for security reasons. “That plea was turned down by the Supreme Court in March this year on the grounds that there is enough security in place,” the family’s counsel Seema Kushwaha said. So, they stay on, sharing space with 20 CRPF men. “She used to love knitting,” the victim’s sister-in-law said. In a corner of the house, colourful door mats she had knitted — the last thing she made — lie exactly where she had left them. “We have not immersed her ashes. We won’t until we get justice,” the sister-in-law added. “We are where we were a year ago. Nothing has changed. The government has fulfilled none of its promises except the Rs 25-lakh assistance.” That money is seeing them through now. But their counsel, Kushwaha, said they are entitled to more. “Rs 16.5 lakh under the provisions of the SC/ST Rules,” she said. There was also a job and a house the government had promised. That seems to have fallen through the cracks because of a “misinterpretation”. DM Ramesh Ranjan told TOI, “As far as I know, the family had told the administration it doesn’t need any support.” That statement, Kushwaha said, was taken out of context from a court hearing. “They had told the court they wanted nothing but justice. It was a cry of despair. The district administration seems to have taken it literally,” she added. The next hearing is on Thursday.

---||Nashik||City police approval must to put up banners||Nashik: The city police have announced that police approval will be mandatory to put up hoardings or banners in various parts of the city. Until now, only the permission of the Nashik Municipal Corporation was needed to put up a hoarding or banner. However, considering the possible implications of objectionable hoardings, which could create a law and order situation, police commissioner Deepak Pandey has decided to make police permission compulsory. Pandey said all applications about the hoardings, that the NMC receives will have to be forwarded to the city police for its permission. “Police intervention is necessary as this issue is related to law and order and as the civic polls are due early next year, the banner and posters should not hurt the sentiments of people. The city police will coordinate with NMC on the issue,” he said. If the hoardings are put without police permission, the persons concerned will face police action. A notification in this regard would soon be issued. On the backdrop of upcoming festivals like Navratri, Diwali and the NMC elections, hoardings would be put up in various parts. The city police are of the view that there should be certain regulations regarding what is put on the hoardings. No one should put up hoardings with objectionable matters on them and which could hurt people’s sentiments. Hoardings without police or NMC permission will be considered illegal and the anti-encroachment department of the NMC will immediately remove them. The police would also register cases against such people putting up illegal hoarding. The police have sought the list of places authorised to put up hoardings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/city-police-approval-must-to-put-up-banners/articleshow/86237968.cms||Santosh Sonawane

Donate Rs 11,000||Lucknow: Battling financial crunch as an outcome of post-2014 political marginalisation and to cope with the monetary requirements to contest the 2022 elections, the Congress party has resorted to fund raising. UP Congress has notified that Congress ticket hopefuls can submit their applications along with a donation of Rs 11,000 to the party coffers. Interested candidates may submit their papers either to the state or district units from September 16. The last date to apply is September 26. “All applicants should submit their applications with the authorised persons at the district/state level along with a ‘sahyog rashi’ (contribution amount) of Rs 11,000 by September 26,” an order issued by UP Congress chief Ajay Kumar Lallu said. On the reason behind the move, Lallu said: “All opposition parties take contributions against the ticket. While some charge hefty sums off the record, we have been upfront. Also, the amount is simply a token sum and will be used for the publicity of the party during the election.” He also said that the entire process is transparent and donations will be recorded for any kind of audit. “The amount may be deposited through RTGS, demand draft or pay order and a receipt against payment will be issued,” he said. Senior leaders also said that the disclaimer will help in weeding out non-serious persons from applying for the position. “Anything free is often valued less and may also turn a serious matter into a free for all business which dilutes the effort of the party. The clause will help in minimising the risk of such nuisance,” said one of them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/want-to-contest-on-congress-ticket-donate-rs-11000/articleshow/86247174.cms||Shailvee Sharda

The petitioner stated that pursuant to a GO passed by the state government, schools were reopened from September 1. He stated that within a few days, many teachers and students were infected with Covid-19.He stated that it would not be safe for the students to attend physical classes in the present pandemic situation. Even though online classes are available as an option, the schools are not following the hybrid system due to which the parents are forced to send their children to schools.Vahabudeen further stated that though the government had given instructions that only permissible strength of students should attend the physical classes, the same was not being followed in most of the schools. He stated that the physical classes may not assume any significance, that too when there is spread of infection among students and teachers at schools. Hence, the petitioner stated that there is an emergent need for closure of schools and to continue online classes to ensure the safety of the students and teachers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/stop-physical-classes-due-to-covid-spread/articleshow/86245188.cms||---

There is only one town bus per day from the village to Thirumangalam. Hence, the villagers have to travel in nearly three town buses from Puliyankulam to Virudhunagar, Virudhunagar to Thirumangalam and Thirumangalam to Madurai. This trip is not only time consuming but the people have to spend more money for the bus travel.The petitioner stated that the object of bifurcation and constitution of new districts should be for the welfare of the people and it should enable the people to reach the district headquarters with ease in order to redress their grievances with the district level authorities such as the district collector and superintendent of police.He stated that the geographical location of the headquarters in a district, plays a significant role in making such bifurcations. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/plea-in-hc-to-merge-madurai-village-with-virudhunagar/articleshow/86245213.cms||---
---||Mumbai||89% crimes on Maharashtra railways last year were of theft: NCRB||MUMBAI: Restricted train services and commuter traffic due to lockdown in 2020 (Jan-Dec) reduced overall crimes, under Indian Penal Code, on railway premises in India by 70% over 2019. Railways in the state reported over 11,500 cases, second only to Delhi railways if crime rate is taken into consideration. In terms of violations relating to railway property and travel, Railway Protection Force in the state recorded most number of offences (over 67,900) in the country. “Maharashtra railways has a policy of not turning away a single complainant and encouraging registration of offences,” said a senior IPS officer. About 89% of all crimes on state railways last year were thefts. Police attribute this to their decision of recording lost or missing items as ‘stolen’. Not only did the state report the most thefts (10,287) and robberies (627), but also maximum offences involving the human body, such as assault. “In Mumbai, we will have a complete revamp of the electronic surveillance camera network which will aid detection and investigation of crimes. Through railway authorities, we will get smart cameras that would have facial recognition technology,” said Quaiser Khalid, Mumbai GRP commissioner. He added that Mumbai railway police had a 85% detection rate of robberies in the current year and had recovered stolen valuables worth Rs 1 crore. “We have also communicated to the railways that land owned by them outside station areas, like taxi drop-off points, also needs to have cameras as crimes often occur here,” Khalid added. Amid the 2020 lockdown, cases of ‘fatka’ theft had risen in Mumbai. “Along with RPF, we identified ‘fatka’ points and stepped up deployment to avert cases. We also surveyed slum colonies along tracks and got information on jobless youth living there as perpetrators of ‘fatka thefts’ often take cover in these colonies,” said a GRP officer. As the services of home guards were withdrawn earlier this year due to non payment of dues (they were night escorts in ladies compartments), GRP has sought an increase in its manpower to secure women travellers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-90-crimes-on-rly-land-in-state-were-of-theft/articleshow/86245231.cms||Nitasha Natu
---||Madurai||Tamil Nadu: Caste murders rock Tirunelveli as dalit man is beheaded||TIRUNELVELI: Barely two days after a man from the thevar community was beheaded, a dalit man met the same fate and his head was found at the place of the first murder at Gopalasamudram on the outskirts of the city on Wednesday. He was identified as a 32-year-old farmer named A Mariappan. The two incidents are believed to be a continuation of a series of killings that took place about eight years ago in 2013 and 2014. According to police, it all started with the murder of Manthiram, a dalit from Gopalasamudram, by a gang in November 2013. The accused in the murders were arrested and put behind bars. On Monday night, Shankarasubramanian, 38, a thevar man of Keelaseval Nainarkulam, was murdered and his head cut off by a gang near a Tasmac outlet at Vaduvoorpatti near Munneerpallam. His head was seen lying on the grave of Manthiram on Tuesday. The police suspected it to be retaliation by the relatives and associates of Manthiram who thought Shankarasubramanian helped the accused in the murder. Munneerpallam police formed special teams to nab the accused and vigil was stepped up to avoid revenge killings. However, on Wednesday morning, dalit farmer A Mariappan was hacked to death near Sengulam tank in Gopalasamudram His head was thrown at the place where Shankarasubramanian was murdered two days ago, about four kilometres away. Mariappan is said to be an accused in a murder case in 2014. Tirunelveli range DIG Praveen Kumar Abinapu and SP N Manivannan visited the place and conducted preliminary inquiries. They also reviewed security arrangements to avert further retaliation. Munneerpallam police registered a case and special teams were on the lookout for the accused in both the cases. Security was stepped up at the Tirunelveli medical college hospital where Mariappan’s body was taken for autopsy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/caste-murders-rock-tirunelveli-as-dalit-man-32-is-beheaded/articleshow/86245285.cms||---

The investment was announced on Wednesday after a delegation of Malabar Gold and Diamonds headed by Malabar Group chairman MP Ahmed met Telangana’s industries minister KT Rama Rao. While the Kozhikode-based company will be investing Rs 300 crore in the refinery, it will be pumping in Rs 450 crore in the jewellery manufacturing unit, for which it has identified a 3.75-acre parcel of land at the Maheshwaram Industrial Park, Malabar Gold & Diamonds managing director (India) Asher Ottamoochikkal told TOI. The refinery and manufacturing unit is expected to generate around 2,500 jobs. The Malabar group already has a smaller jewellery manufacturing unit that is operational in Hyderabad with a headcount of around 300-400 people. He indicated that the company was hopeful of both these projects becoming operational within the next one year given the speed with which the Telangana government has responded to the company’s requirements. “We studied different states and found Telangana to be the right place for these projects because of the skilled manpower, quality infrastructure that has been developed in the state and the positive government support,” he added. According to Ottamoochikkal, the company is looking at a turnover of around Rs 4,500 crore from the unit that will manufacture jewellery made of precious stones, diamonds as well as gold, with a plan to showcase and popularise the work being done of Telangana’s karigars not just in India but also abroad. “Telangana’s karigars, from places like Karimnagar and Hyderabad are doing good work which is also becoming popular abroad. We are planning to market the region’s capability in Indian and international markets,” he explained. Talking about the refinery, he said it will cater not just to the requirements of the company’s proposed manufacturing unit in Telangana but also the other units in Hyderabad and the rest of the market. According to Ottamoochikkal, the company is looking at a turnover of around Rs 4,500 crore from the unit that will manufacture jewellery made of precious stones, diamonds as well as gold.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/malabar-group-to-invest-rs-750cr-in-gold-refinery-jewellery-unit-in-hyd/articleshow/86245253.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

The Spanish coach was upset after key player Jorge Ortiz suffered an ankle injury following a reckless challenge from a Sudeva Delhi FC defender in their 2-1 win on Monday. “After the game I was talking to the match commissioner and I don’t know he was laughing,” Ferrando said during an online interaction on Thursday. “For the club and tournament, for everybody, it is not a good moment with the injury. His job is to protect the players. His job is to protect all the teams. His job is to decide the best referees and, in this case, I am very upset.” Goa have already made it to the quarterfinals and face Jamshedpur FC at the Vivekananda Yuba Bharati Krirangan on Friday. Goa have assembled a strong squad with four foreign players. Ferrando had introduced captain Edu Bedia and Ortiz in the second half after starting with Alberto Noguera in the first two games. There were just 10 minutes remaining when Ortiz scored the second against Sudeva with a spectacular long ranger but was caught with an unwarranted tackle by Akbar Khan. Ortiz has already been ruled out of the tournament and Goa are sweating on his fitness as the eighth season of the Indian Super League starts on November 19. The disciplinary committee is yet to act and Ferrando not surprisingly is upset that his players do not get the protection they deserve on the field. “Normal motivation now of the players is different. We are here to participate with the players with the best line ups but for us, now is a big question for me is necessary to stay here and work or maybe stay in Goa and prepare for the pre-season,” said Ferrando. Goa have already submitted an official complaint about the incident to the organisers and are still awaiting a reply. “We are not trying to victimise any player or individual incident, but we are just hoping there are rules and regulations in place, and I hope they act upon that,” said FC Goa’s director of football Ravi Puskur. “As organisers, we want them to show us that our players can be protected. The coaches are there, the foreign players are there and there is a little bit of fear within the team.” In their complaint to the Durand Cup organisers immediately after the clash against Sudeva on Monday, Goa called for “immediate intervention to rectify the matter by imposing the appropriate sanctions.“ “Today we are on the receiving end and tomorrow it could be another team and another player. The only way to keep the safety of the players in check is to ensure that an example is set,” Puskur said in his complaint. Goa want to be reassured that “safety of the players is still a strong priority for the tournament organisers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ortiz-injury-has-fc-goa-worried-ferrando-calls-for-players-to-be-protected-by-officials/articleshow/86273612.cms||FLAVIO LOPES

The action was taken after the two-member committee comprising UP Police Recruitment & Promotion Board chairman R K Vishwakarma and Additional Director General of Women Power Line 1090 Neera Rawat constituted by the state government to probe the entire incident submitted its report. The woman, who had lodged a rape case against BSP MP Atul Rai, had also accused several police and judicial officers of harassing her at the behest of the accused. A home department official said the male companion of the woman had given a complaint to then SSP Varanasi on August 27, 2020, expressing apprehension of being killed by the MP’s aide. The investigation was given to then ASP Vikas Chandra Tripathi who registered a case on December 2, which the probe panel said was negligence on his part. Officials said the deceased woman had also given an application to the SSP against Rai’s aide for blackmailing her and spreading lies about her, but a case was registered after three months. On June 19, Varanasi police commissioner had entrusted ASP Tripathi with another probe about an email sent by the woman raising several allegations, but no report has been filed yet. Then SSP Varanasi has asked Tripathi to probe the complaint given by Bharat Singh against his BSP MP son, but the ASP filed two reports, each with a different view. Sources in the home department said that another ASP rank officer has been issued a notice in the same case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/report-filed-kashi-asp-to-face-action/articleshow/86247176.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Delhi||Cook, sweeper rob woman of Rs 50L, nabbed in 6 hours||New Delhi: Four men were arrested within six hours of robbing a 55-year-old woman in her house in Maurya Enclave. The woman’s cook and sweeper, who had been hired less than a week ago, threw red chilli on her face, tied her and fled with valuables worth over Rs 50 lakh. The duo was not verified by police before being hired by the victim, the wife of Yogesh Singhal, chairman of Chandni Chowk Jewellers’ Association. Singhal said, “It was a traumatic experience for my wife and our family. I appreciate the efforts of police as they were with us all the way and recovered all the stolen goods. The verification was not done because they were hired through a close aide. Our previous helper had gone on leave.” The cook was identified as Aman Kumar Rai (19) and the cleaner as Sanjeev Kumar Ram (18). Their two associates were Ram Pukar Yadav (26), the mastermind of the crime, and Sunil (21), the receiver of the stolen valuables. They were arrested from Madiwala Park near Samrat Cinema in Shakurpur. The robbery was reported on Tuesday. The woman was alone in her house and lying in her bedroom when Rai and Ram entered carrying a bowl full of red chilli powder. “The duo threw the chili powder on her face and eyes. They grabbed her hands and feet, tied her with a cloth and pushed her into the bathroom. After that, they took away the jewellery that she was wearing, her iPhone and an electronic safe,” said DCP (Crime) Joy Tirkey. A police team was formed to gather information about the criminals. “CCTV footage was analysed to check the escape route of the suspects. Finally, the team managed to zero in on them. Following a raid, the four men were nabbed from Madiwala Park,” said the DCP. During interrogation, the accused men confessed that they committed the crime. “They admitted to having robbed Rs 45,400 in cash and jewellery worth Rs 50 lakh. Yadav said he had been planning to rob the house for a long time. He then roped in Rai and Ram to commit the robbery,” police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cook-sweeper-rob-woman-of-rs-50l-nabbed-in-6-hours/articleshow/86275857.cms||---

Delhi is placed second with a 15.8% dip. The overall crime percentage in 19 metropolitan cities fell by 17.2%. The report highlighted that senior citizens have become victims of extortion, grievous hurt, cheating, attempt to murder and dacoity. A senior IPS officer said, “Despite the pandemic and police presence on roads and in localities, senior citizens became victims who were more vulnerable staying alone in the city and having to depend on a hired household or caretaker, and in most crimes these people commit the offence.” Investigators said apart from individual criminals, gangs target the elderly going on morning walks, and make away with valuables by posing as cops. NGO Helpage India member Prakash Borgaonkar said the survey had shown there are at least 112 million senior citizens in India and 40% of them stay alone. “They are soft targets and there have been many cases where senior citizens were killed by employees for financial gains. In most cases, victims do not register employee’s names. We have created a senior citizens’ group, where they are given an awareness programme and told to register their names with local police and are advised to register employees’ antecedents with police.,” said Borgaonkar. A senior IPS officer said police presence had been beefed up on roads to keep a check on crimes against seniors on morning walks at isolated places. Preventive measures have been initiated against habitual offenders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-31-fall-in-crimes-against-senior-citizens-in-2020/articleshow/86245371.cms||Narayan Namboodiri
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Parents allege pressure to send children to class, schools refute||BHOPAL: With the reopening of offline classes, complaints about schools pressuring students and parents to attend offline classes and exams have started pouring in. While the guidelines state that consent of parents is mandatory for children to attend physical classes, it is no more adhered to by the schools. While announcing opening of primary class from 1 from September 20, the state government has made consent of parents a must. Most parents have made it clear that with not vaccinations for children under 18 years of age, they won’t send their kids and take a risk. “I have received a message from school that my son has to attend offline exams. I met the school management and told them that they can take full year fee, but I will not send my son to attend offline exams,” said Ajeet Dubey, father of a class 6 student. Parents also alleged that schools are not following the Covid instructions. “Parent’s consent is a mockery as no school is following it. Schools should not pressure students to attend offline classes if they are not willing,” said another parent Shekhar Singh. However, schools said that they have put any pressure on the students or parents. “We have only contacted parents to convince them for sending their kids. It is upto them to take a final decision about it,” said a school owner wishing anonymity. The state government, not considering the poor attendance — barely 20% in classes 6 to 12 — went ahead with the decision to reopen schools from primary classes with 50% strength. Decision to open primary classes in schools from September 20 was taken in a meeting chaired by the chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. It has been made clear that district administration said that concurrence of district crisis management group would also be taken for opening of primary classes and residential schools. A spokesperson for the district administration told TOI that the state government has allowed opening of primary classes, residential schools and hostels and if crisis management group in some districts feel that situation is not conducive in their district to do it, they may decide otherwise. “If there are more cases of Corona at some place and the district crisis management group decides not to open the primary classes, residential schools and hostels for this reason, they can take a decision accordingly,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/pessure-to-send-kids-to-classes-allege-parents-schools-refute/articleshow/86240326.cms||Ramendra Singh

The expedition to Mt Shivling, one of the highest peaks in the region at 6,543 metres, was flagged off by Uttarkashi district magistrate Mayur Dixit. The team is expected to return on October 24. The Indian Mountaineering Foundation (IMF), the apex national body for mountaineering and allied sports, said expeditions by foreign mountaineers in the country had come to an end after the first wave in March last year. Bhagirathi Rawat, director of IMF, told TOI, “This is the first official group of foreign mountaineers to go on expedition anywhere in the country since the pandemic broke out.” Mountaineers, both foreigners and Indians, need to apply to the IMF for permits before embarking on an expedition in the country. Pitambar Singh Panwar, who runs a local trek and tour agency which is coordinating the expedition, said four mountaineers were from Switzerland and two from Austria. “The team led by Stephan Siegrist will set up a base camp at Tapovan and after a few days of acclimatisation, they will attempt to scale the peak,” he said. Those associated with the tourism sector have pinned their hopes on such expeditions to revive business. “A lot of businesses depend directly or indirectly on foreign tourists that arrive in Uttarkashi every year to scale various Himalayan peaks. Expeditions restarting will be good for business,” said Jayendra Rana, president of Garhwal Himalaya Trekking and Mountaineering Association Uttarkashi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/india-opens-its-peaks-to-foreigners-again-6-member-team-to-scale-mt-shivling/articleshow/86237990.cms||Abhyudaya Kotnala
---||Bhopal||College day one: Students turn up sans vaccination certificates & parents’ consent in Bhopal||BHOPAL: As the colleges reopened for offline classes on Wednesday, most of the students failed to bring along their vaccination certificates and were denied entry to the campus on the very first day of reopening. Most of the students had even turned up without bringing the ‘parents’ consent’ form which was made mandatory for gaining entry to the campus by the higher education department. At Motilal Vigyan Mahavidyalaya (MVM), one of the oldest colleges in Bhopal, teachers were seen instructing students on importance of the certificates for allowing. However, most of the students could be seen making requests to let them in. The situation was no different in other colleges that reopened on Wednesday. Students said they were not given clear instructions and got to know about the vaccine and parents’ consent certificates only when they were asked for it at the entrance gates. Due to lack of information, several students of first year too turned up at the campus even as their classes are scheduled to start from October 1. Higher education minister Mohan Yadav said, “The students will be informed about the college, course, subject, change of subject, scholarship and other things for the first 10 days. So that they understand all the procedures before the actual classes start,” said Yadav. Only those students with 50% strength and atleast first dose of vaccination can attend the classes on the campuses. College staff too have been instructed to submit their certificates of first dose of vaccination. Libraries, hostels and mess will also start on the campuses. However, hostel facility will be available for the students only after they submit consent letter of their parents. Minister Yadav has given instructions to carry out practical and academic work by forming separate groups on the basis of safety standards of Covid-19 at each level in case the number of students is high. Yadav said that the concerned institutions would be bound to take major decisions in this regard in the context of the availability of infrastructure and the local situation. “Online classes will also continue to be conducted by the educational institutions,” said Yadav. He has also given instructions to prepare separate time-tables for offline and online classes by the educational institutions. Yadav informed that libraries are also started in all educational institutions for the study of students. Only registered students will be given admission. The staff and students have been instructed to strictly follow the Covid protocol. There will be 50% attendance in the library study room also as per the guidelines. Continuous monitoring will be done by the registrar at the university level and the Regional Additional Director concerned at the college level and its report will be sent every Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/day-one-students-turn-up-without-vax-certificates-parents-consent/articleshow/86240364.cms||---
---||Pune||Dengue stings harder; more patients in Pune require longer care||PUNE: A steep rise in dengue cases in the PMC areas has set alarm bells ringing in the health corridors, with questions being raised over civic preparedness and pre-monsoon measures. PMC data showed that 472 dengue cases were recorded in August and another 204 cases in September so far. The caseload has gone up to 2,076 so far — 1,803 from private hospitals and 273 cases from government-run sentinel centres. Narayan Peth resident Viraj Bhaskar Taware, who was diagnosed with dengue last month with his mother and one-and-a-half-year-old child, said, “My mother is yet to make full recovery... Civic staffers had found breeding spots of dengue larvae at the construction site of a redevelopment project in my area.” Choked nullahs and poor upkeep have led to mosquito menace in the Hadapsar area too, especially in the housing societies behind Vaibhav Theatre. In one such affected-society, 80-year-old Balawant Ranade, an advocate, has been fighting against the unsanitary conditions for the last five years. “We have to bear with the problem every monsoon. It worsens during the post-monsoon period in August and September,” Ranade, who stays in Samrat Garden Society behind Vaibhav theatre in Hadapsar, said. Barring a few swanky townships, there is complete disregard to garbage lifting and disposal in the Hadapsar area, he said. Santosh More of Balaji Paradise housing society said, “We are doing our bit to keep our premises clean. But what about the unlifted garbage and rainwater stagnation outside the society areas.” Family physician Pravin Darak, who practises in the Dhankawdi area, said, “Residents in the congested localities are increasingly getting detected with dengue. However, the illness is mild in most. I have only seen two cases of dengue shock syndrome, a severe type of dengue, which I eventually referred to the Bharati hospital for better care.” Family physician Santaji Kadam, who practises in the Karvenagar area, also admitted of a sharp rise in dengue cases in the last 15 days, with most cases coming from Warje, Shivane and the surrounding fringe areas. Experts said quite a few residents diagnosed with dengue were showing rapid downfall in platelet count reaching up to 10,000 per microlitre of blood. A normal person has a platelet count between 1,50,000 and 4,50,000 per microlitre of blood. About 80-90% of patients with dengue have levels below 1,00,000, while 10-20% of patients see critically low levels of 20,000 or less, the experts said, adding that only about 5% of dengue patients face complications like bleeding, requiring platelet transfusions. “Besides, 50% cases are showing dengue rashes, which was very uncommon till two years ago. Around two out of 10 cases are showing increased liver enzymes, causing signs of jaundice,” said senior family physician Avinash Bhondwe, who practises in the Shivajinagar area. City hospitals are seeing a rise in patients requiring long-term care. “I treated 59 patients at Sahyadri hospital’s Hadapsar branch in the last two months. Of them, 20 required hospitalisation. One of them also succumbed to dengue-linked complications,” said critical care expert Kapil Borawake. Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital’s chief intensivist Prasad Rajhans said, “There were two dengue-related casualties in our hospital. Most cases, however, are mild.” Civic health officials have stepped up action on establishments, mainly housing societies and bungalows, not taking measures to check mosquito breeding. “We have also scaled up the use of larvicides and fumigation to destroy the breeding spots and check adult mosquitoes,” said Sanjeev Wavre, head of the Pune Municipal Corporation’s insect control department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/dengue-stings-harder-more-patients-require-longer-care/articleshow/86245320.cms||Umesh Isalkar

After much deliberation, the department has decided that only those candidates who have completed the D.El.Ed course in regular mode would be appointed as primary teachers in the state. Appointments are to be made on 2,500 vacant primary teacher posts in the state. The decision is a setback to the open learning diploma holders who had become hopeful of being appointed as primary teachers after the central government, last year, announced that they can also be included in the appointment process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/only-regular-d-el-ed-would-be-considered-for-primary-teacher-post-in-ukhand/articleshow/86240358.cms||Mohammad Anab

The truck carrying panels worth a total cost of Rs 6 crore was on its way to Tirunelveli when officials from the enforcement wing of the commercial taxes and registration department inspected it and found that taxes were unpaid for the goods.Addressing reporters on Wednesday in Madurai, minister for commercial taxes and registration, P Moorthy said that the truck was seized and kept under the protection of the Madurai city police. “The truck was travelling from Mumbai in Maharashtra to Tirunelveli but no taxes had been paid at all by the owners. This is why there is a need to monitor commercial establishments and movement of goods. Only when the taxes and the fine amount are paid, the truck will be released back to the owners,” said Moorthy. According to sources, the private company which owned the solar panels had evaded taxes of up to more than Rs 40 lakh. The minister also said that inspections were being carried out at 103 places across the state to check whether taxes are paid and all necessary documents are accounted for in commercial establishments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/truck-with-solar-panels-seized-for-tax-evasion/articleshow/86245305.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Blast at BJP Nainital dist prez house, cause unknown; CM orders probe||Nainital: An explosion rocked the house of BJP’s Nainital district president, Pradeep Bisht, severely damaging all five rooms on the ground floor and doors and windows on Tuesday night and prompting the chief minister to order a probe into the incident. No injuries were reported and the cause of the blast remains unknown. A case was registered against unidentified people under section 436 (mischief by fire or explosive substance) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). A team of forensic experts, bomb squad, district administration and police visited the BJP leader’s house in Haldwani’s Heera Nagar on Wednesday. Chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami also ordered DIG Kumaon to investigate the matter while several state BJP leaders spoke to Bisht on Wednesday and expressed solidarity. Bisht said, "We were sleeping on the first floor when we heard a loud noise. When we rushed downstairs, we saw the entire floor was damaged. We called police and they are looking into the matter." Haldwani station house officer (SHO), Arun Saini, told TOI that a preliminary investigation has failed to determine the cause of the explosion. “Forensic samples from the house have been sent to labs for investigation,” he said, adding that all five rooms on the ground floor had suffered damage. According to neighbours, they heard a deafening explosion at 12:30 am on Tuesday night. “Prima facie, it appears that it was something inside the house that exploded. We suspect a gas leak in the kitchen,” the SHO said. Nainital district magistrate (DM) Dheeraj Garbyal said there were several angles the probe was looking at. “We are waiting for a report from our forensic team,” Garbyal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/blast-at-bjp-nainital-dist-prez-house-cause-unknown-cm-orders-probe/articleshow/86238003.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Ludhiana||War room being prepared to check what goes on in city||Ludhiana: The much-awaited work of an integrated command and control centre (ICCC) for the network of CCTV cameras installed along the urban roads has started in municipal zone D under the Smart City mission. They are developing offices and fitting the display screens for this war room to monitor what goes on in the city. Of the 1,401 security cameras installed under safe city project, 450 are dysfunctional. The officials claimed that these cameras will be replaced before the device grid is linked with the ICCC. The plan includes GPS-fitting the MC vehicles, buses, LED street lights, garbage bins, and even tehbazari to check traffic, sanitation and encroachment through the ICCC. Requesting anonymity, one of the MC officials claimed that in Gwalior, the ICCC had helped the civic authorities monitor the local arrangements for dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic. He said GPS tagging will help the MC track its vehicles and garbage trucks on a central screen. He said: "The ICCC project is crucial to the civic arrangements and many smart cities have adopted it. Even the mobile-phone application that the MC wants to develop a common portal for all kinds of citizen services can be monitored from the ICCC." Bridges and roads department superintending engineer Rahul Gagneja said: "The work has started, and first we will construct the rooms and then fit the screens inside. But first, all the cameras will be linked to the ICCC and monitored from there. We will connect the other services later." About the new possibilities it will bring, Sarabha Nagar resident Sarabjit Singh said: "Building a common platform to monitor all the citizen services is a good idea but the security cameras in the city are installed at an angle that sometimes misses the action during violation. These things should be fixed, too." For a long time, the civic authorities were trying to hire a contractor for this project. It took them four attempts to start this project. Central team to visit tomorrow A team from the Union housing and urban development ministry will visit the city on Friday to review of the ICCC and other projects under the Smart City mission. The civic administration is on its toes before the arrival of housing secretary Durga Shankar Mishra and other officials. On Wednesday, municipal commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal had an hour’s meeting with officials from various branches.The commissioner pulled up the officials over gaps in the garbage-lifting and pathetic condition of the city roads, and told them to go out in the field sometimes instead of sitting in the offices. The officials directed the sanitation staff to maintain the city roads and clear these of garbage regularly. They also asked the bridges and road department to repair the potholes. Sources in the MC said the central ministry’s inspection tour to Punjab will continue for three days and, apart from Ludhiana, the team will also visit Patiala, Jalandhar, and Amritsar. There are chances that the MC officials will take the team to the Sarabha Nagar market, Sidhwan Canal waterfront, under-construction Malhar Road, and the sewage treatment plant for inspection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/war-room-being-prepared-to-check-what-goes-on-in-city/articleshow/86240405.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Donor heart transported to NIMS in 12 minutes via green channel||HYDERABAD: A donor’s heart, which was retrieved from a constable—M Veerababu, who was declared as brain dead by Yashoda hospital at Malakpet—was transported to Nizam Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS) in a green channel within 12 minutes with the help of traffic police and transplanted to a 30-year-old painter. This is the first time that a donor’s heart was allotted to a patient at NIMS from a private hospital. According to a press release, the donor—Veerababu, who was working at Kondapur—met with an accident when his two wheeler was hit by a bus at Gollagudem near Khammam a few days ago. He was rushed to Yashoda hospital where he declared as brain dead. As he had head injuries, the doctors at Yashoda hospital said the chances of improvement in his condition were almost nil. His family members were also convinced about his condition and the hospital requested them to agree for an organ donation under Jeevandan organ donation initiative. After retrieving the heart, they transported within 12 minutes after traffic police provided a green channel and cleared traffic between Malakpet and NIMS Punjagutta. The donor heart brought to NIMS in an ambulance, which started at 1.44 pm from Yashoda Hospital and reached NIMS by 1.56 pm on Wednesday. According to NIMS cardiac surgery chief Dr Amaresh Rao Mallampati, the heart was implanted to a 30-year-old person, who is also from Khammam, as he was suffering from Dilated Cardiomyopathy for the past three years. “Generally it costs nearly Rs 20 lakh to Rs 30 lakh in private hospitals, but this was done freely under Aarogya Sri scheme. A team of the doctors, including Dr Kaladhar, Dr Madhusudhan, Dr Gopal, Dr Padmaja, and Dr Narmada performed the surgery,” he said. According to officials, this is the first time that a donor’s heart was allotted to a patient at NIMS from a private hospital. Due to the chronic heart condition of the painter, the transplant surgeons at NIMS had registered his name in Jeevandan on Tuesday and within a day the hospital was allocated with a matching donor heart under Jeevandan. In the last few years, the surgeons at NIMS have successfully conducted five heart transplants. All five heart transplants were from donor hearts retrieved from patients who were declared as brain dead at NIMS. Jeevandan incharge Dr G Swarnalatha thanked the traffic police for creating the green channel. She said despite the pandemic, organ transplant surgeries have continued in Hyderabad, she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/donor-heart-transported-to-nims-in-12-minutes-via-green-channel/articleshow/86245395.cms||---

---||Pune||For three weeks, Maharashtra facing shortage of auto-disabled syringes||PUNE: The state is facing a shortage of auto-disabled syringes of 0.5 millilitre capacity — the most preferred variant for Covid vaccination — for almost three weeks now. Medical equipment distributors confirmed the development. A source from the district health department also told TOI that there had been reports of short supply of this syringe variant at government vaccination centres. Rajiv Nath, the president of All India Syringe & Needle Manufacturers Association (AISNMA), and the MD of Hindustan Syringes and Medical Devices Limited, told TOI, “The country’s earlier requirement of 0.5 AD (auto-disabled) syringes for routine immunization was 300 million pieces per year. It has gone up to 1.8 billion per year after the Covid vaccination began. We continue to supply these syringes, but there have been reports of shortage and supply chain management issues at the distributors’ ends, which may worsen in the coming time as the vaccine supply increases. We have, therefore, been forewarning the government about this and they have recently directed states to use 0.5 ml/1ml/2 ml /3ml disposable syringes and 1 ml/2 ml/3ml RUP (reuse prevention) syringes for Covid vaccination.” Nath said the Union government should place orders for AD syringes with the two manufacturers in India well in advance so that the latter could ramp up supplies. “We are currently awaiting their response on our letter on probable quantities required in future to book production space and allocate quantities for the next year. But there has been no response so far. To ramp up capacity, we need an order confirmation at least nine months to a year in advance.” Vimal Khemka, secretary, AISNMA, said there was no demand for 0.5ml AD syringes in India before the Covid vaccination started. “Due to limited availability of AD syringes, we made a representation to the Union government to allow use of disposable syringes of 1ml, 2ml and 3ml for Covid vaccination. About 15 manufacturers have started supplying these to the government.” Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, told TOI, “ We were recently notified by the government that we can also use 1ml and 2ml disposable syringes for Covid vaccination with 0.5ml marking on them.” Distributors in Maharashtra said they had not received any stocks of these syringes after August 15-20 this year. Akshay Nahar, owner, Ortholink Marketing, a surgical and Covid products wholesaler, said, “I had recently sent a communication to private hospitals, which said the shortage of this variant of syringes may stay for the next two months.” Umakant Raisoni, owner, Shree Datta Medical Distributors, said “All AD syringe supplies are going to the government centres, with no stocks with distributors supplying to private hospitals.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/for-3-weeks-maharashtra-facing-shortage-of-auto-disabled-syringes/articleshow/86245364.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Nashik||Light vehicles allowed on Dhule-Aurangabad NH||Nashik: The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) on Wednesday started allowing the movement of light motor vehicles (LMVs) on the Dhule-Aurangabad national highway. The movement of all vehicles in that busy highway was stopped after August 31 following several landslides coupled with road damage at the 8km ghat section between Chalisgaon in Jalgaon and Aurangabad district. Arvid Kale, the Aurangabad NHAI project director, told TOI that only LMVs like cars, small jeeps etc are allowed to use the highway. “We will take another 15 to 20 days before allowing heavy vehicles to use that road. At present, some work is still being carried out in the ghat section. Once that is completed, heavy vehicles will be allowed,” he said. NHAI has set up a couple of iron height barriers on the road to ensure no heavy vehicles can use it for now. NHAI had undertaken the repair work at a hectic pace due to which the LMVs could start using the road within 15 days of the damage. “There was substantial damage to the road in the ghat section. For the first three days, our workers worked round the clock to remove the huge amount of slush and rubble from the ghat section that had accumulated. They also had to remove several vehicles which were stuck. Once that work was over, the repair work of the roads was at a quick pace,” said Kale. According to him, the local administrations requested the NHAI to reopen the road as fast as possible since the Ganesh festival is on and people would use the road to travel. After the incidents of landslide, Jalgaon collector Abhijit Raut and superintendent of police Dr Pravin Mundhe visited the affected spots at Chalisgaon. Since the road was closed, all vehicles were diverted from Chalisgaon via Nandgaon to Aurangabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/light-vehicles-allowed-on-dhule-aurangabad-nh/articleshow/86238000.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta
---||Trichy||More farmers dump onion bulb, embrace seeds||Trichy: The horticulture department has started distributing onion seeds instead of onion bulbs to meet the growing demand for small onion. The seeds are produced in farms maintained by the department in Trichy. Hundreds of onion farmers have benefited from the initiative as they can minimize input cost and reap higher yields, officials said. Onion seeds are being readied as a special scheme under the National Horticulture Development Programme following the rise in onion price during off-season. The department had set in motion an action plan to produce onion seeds on 500 acres in Trichy last year. Accordingly, onion seeds were being produced at the Thorakkudi state horticulture farm in Manikandam block. Government is providing 2.5 kg of onion seeds an hectare to farmers under the hybrid vegetable area expansion scheme of National Horticulture Mission. The onion seeds are aimed at covering 750 acres in the district during this special season, deputy director of horticulture C Vimala told TOI. “Farmers have to store huge amounts of onion bulbs as seed every year. However, due to various reasons they could not keep them safe for a long time. This would create demand for the seed onion. When seeds are used instead of bulbs, they need not keep a major portion of their produce for seed purposes as in the traditional method,” the deputy director said. Since November-December is the favourable season for small onion, several farmers have commenced preparatory works to sow the seed which costs Rs 4,000 for a kilogram. As one hectare requires 2.5kg, farmers have to purchase it for Rs 10,000. In the case of onion bulb, farmers have to spend more money than the seed, officials added. “When compared to onion bulb, new seed varieties such as Co 6 will give higher yield and are disease-resistant. Due to these reasons, farmers come forward to sow seeds,” the deputy director added. Once all farmers start using seeds, price fluctuations in the market can be stabilized. Officials are persuading farmers and training them to adopt the new technology.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/more-farmers-dump-onion-bulb-embrace-seeds/articleshow/86245357.cms||---

Shetty has been shown as one of the 43 witnesses in the supplementary chargesheet. There are five star witnesses in the case who have deposed before a magistrate and given statements against the accused. Shetty, though, has not said anything against Kundra that could help the prosecution, said officials. Officials said this supplementary chargesheet is against Kundra and Thorpe. Kundra’s brother-in-law Pradeep Bakshi and one Yash Thakur have been shown as absconding accused in the chargesheet. Police said in the supplementary chargesheet they have attached details of email exchanges and WhatsApp chats between Kundra and the other accused, 24 hard disks containing pornographic material seized from Kundra’s office, Andheri bank details of Kundra’s firms and Hotshot app. The crime branch press release stated Kundra and Thorpe in connivance with the other arrested accused took advantage of struggling aspiring models to indulge in obscene and pornographic acts. Kundra’s name had surfaced in July after the crime branch’s property cell probing the case stumbled upon the involvement of UK-based production company Kenrin and arrested its executive Umesh Kamat in the case. Kamat, a former employee of Kundra, is accused of uploading at least seven to eight “porn and obscene” videos allegedly shot by Gehana Vasisth on a social media app for monetary consideration. Police suspect Kundra has a stake in Kenrin and was involved in the production and distribution of pornography material. In February, the property cell had raided a bungalow in Madh Island, Malad, and busted a porn video film-making racket and rescued a woman.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-shilpa-shown-as-a-witness-in-kundra-case-chargesheet/articleshow/86245439.cms||Ahmed Ali

---||Ludhiana||15-18-year-olds logged max Covid cases in 1-18 age group||Ludhiana: This year, 15-18-year-olds logged the maximum number of Covid cases in 1-18 age group. Experts say it is on expected lines and efforts must be made to check infection among them in view of the looming threat of the third wave.The paediatric data compiled by the health department shows that from January 1 to September 13, 3,762 cases were reported in Ludhiana in 1-18 age group. Of these, maximum cases (1,801) were from 15-18 age group, which is 47.9%.The 11-14 age group reported the second highest case count of 930 (24.7%). The lowest number of cases (350) was from 1-5 age group, which is 9.3%.District epidemiologist Dr Ramesh Bhagat says, “We have been collecting the data as it is to be sent to the state health department and used for devising the plan to check cases. Of 62,737 Covid cases reported in Ludhiana from January 1 to September 13, around 6% were from 1-18 age group.”The health experts say there are various factors for cases in particular age groups.“The data is on expected lines. Earlier, older people reported maximum cases and then young adults (30 plus). The age of Covid patients came down further, with younger people getting increasingly affected. In children as well, adolescents are more affected than smaller kids. Due to some innate mechanisms or immunity patterns, some age groups are more affected by a particular virus. So, it cannot solely be who has been exposed to virus,” says former DMCH principal and paediatrician Dr Daljeet Singh.“Since vaccine is not for children, they must take the required precautions. Social distancing may be difficult, especially after schools have reopened, as they are not much responsive to the norms,” he adds. The district administration has claimed to have made arrangements for the third wave. Deputy commissioner Varinder Sharma said 100-bed ICU, of which 50 each are for paediatrics intensive care unit and neo-natal intensive care unit, has been set up by DMCH. There are 13 beds in civil hospital for paediatric care.In August, a committee of experts constituted under the National Institute of Disaster Management (NIDM) had warned of an imminent third wave of Covid that could peak around October and sought better medical preparedness for children who might be at similar risk as adults.

In a letter issued on September 13, the additional director of health services, Archana Patil, stated that there was a difference of over 8% in the vaccination figures of men and women in nine districts. Raigad (15%), Mumbai (14%), Aurangabad (12%) and Pune (11%) are some of the districts with the highest gender disparity in vaccination. Out of an estimated 6.55 crore total doses administered in the state till September 8, men got around 3.55 crore doses, while women received around 3 crore doses, the letter stated. Indian medical Association’s Hospital Board of India chairman Sanjay Patil said, “We are missing out on awareness about Covid-19 vaccination among women in urban as well as rural areas. To address it, various women’s groups need to be sensitised. Accessibility and reach of the vaccination sites also need to be taken care of to make sure more women come forward. The issues could also pertain to the online slot booking, which also needs to be taken care of.” Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer, Pune Zilla Parishad, told TOI, “We are aware of the issue of gender disparity and will be addressing it by reaching out to the women’s self-help groups. There is a lot of misinformation when it comes to women’s health and the effect of vaccination.” According to Prasad, the Pune rural does not have much difference in male-female vaccination coverage. But, he said, they were aware of some sections, such as pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers and elderly women, were hesitant. Among districts, Mumbai sits at the top with 80% of its adult population having received at least one shot. The city has administered 1.07 crore doses, which includes the complete vaccination of 32lakh people. Pune occupies the second spot having vaccinated 75.3% of the adult population with at least one dose, while Bhandara comes third with 74% vaccination. Mumbai and Pune are the only districts where over 30% of the population have got fully vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/9-distts-including-pune-mumbai-told-to-improve-vaccination-of-women/articleshow/86245418.cms||Piyush Bhusari

---||Mumbai||Meet the Mumbai’s two penguin chicks, zoo now has 9 Humboldt birds in enclosure||MUMBAI: The colony of Humboldt penguins at the Byculla zoo has two new members, both hatched in-house, taking the number of the birds in the enclosure to nine. The first, named Oreo, was hatched on May 1 and the second, which is yet to be named, on August 19 by separate breeding pairs from among the colony’s seven adults, four of which are female. The zoo is currently shut to visitors owing to Covid restrictions. The first chick, Oreo, was born to Daisy and Donald, both of whom are five and a half years old. The newest was born to Flipper (who is eight) and Molt (five); the pair had also produced a hatchling on Independence Day in 2018, but it died of birth anomalies within a week. News of the 2021 births was kept under wraps as the zoo had initially planned an announcement on October 1, when Oreo would complete five months. “We are yet to determine the sex of Flipper and Molt’s chick as it is still in the nesting area with its parents. For now, we are letting its parents rear it. Our vets only assist by feeding the parents every 2-3 hours (with fish like mackerel and sardine) so that the pair in turn keeps feeding the chick,” said zoo director Dr Sanjay Tripathi. Sex determination will be done through any of three methods: a feather test, an examination of a sample from the remains of the hatched egg, or the chick’s blood sample. Oreo, who is now over four months old, has mixed well within the colony. His parents gradually introduced him to the others, protecting him whenever he would come under attack, as Humboldt penguins are sometimes prone to do. “His parents also taught him to defend himself and even to attack others when necessary,” said a zoo official. “Nowadays Oreo does not go into his nest and mostly hangs out with the adult female Penguin called Bubble (the only adult in the colony without a partner) and roams around in the enclosure.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-meet-the-citys-two-penguin-chicks-zoo-now-has-9-humboldt-birds-in-enclosure/articleshow/86245525.cms||Richa Pinto

In a detailed note issued on September 14, the state’s additional chief secretary, health, Dr Pradeep Vyas, directed the collectors of Akola, Buldhana, Dhule, Hingoli, Nanded, Nandurbar, Osmanabad, Palghar, Parbhani and Yavatmal to ramp up the testing infrastructure. He said these 10 districts were registering less than 2.5 lakh tests per 10 lakh population, while the state’s average was 4.34 lakh for every 10-lakh population. “The second wave is slowly and steadily waning and the weekly positivity rate (WPR) for the state is 2.6%. But with many western countries reporting third wave and the Centre’s warning about it, we need to be cautious,” stated the letter of Dr Vyas addressed to all the collectors and the commissioners. It stated, “There has been a 20% dip in testing now from the earlier period and this is a cause of worry.” The note stated that Pune, Satara, Sanlgi, Nashik, Palghar, Osmanabad and Sindhudurg districts also needed to increase testing because their WPR was more than the state’s average of 2.6%. ‘The health officials stressed on increased surveillance in Pune, Ahmednagar and Solapur, especially in the rural areas. Dr Vyas directed the district collectors to take strict action against the laboratories uploading the Covid test reports late.  The reports would have to be updated on the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)’s portal within 24 hours, stated the directive. The Pune district authorities on Tuesday directed the officials in rural areas to ramp up testing to 2,500 per day in each taluka before the Ganapati immersion day because of movement of large number of people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/state-health-dept-prod-to-10-districts-on-testing/articleshow/86245464.cms||Nisha Nambiar

One of their accomplices is at large. A stolen car buyer has also been arrested.The gang had recently snatched two cars from J Block of BRS Nagar. The police have also arrested a man who had purchased a stolen car from the gang. The police have recovered four cars, gold jewellery, mobile phones and a weapon with live cartridges from their possession. The accused father-son duo had been in the crime for the past several years, and so far have stolen and snatched at least 50 cars.

The absconding accused is Lakhwinder Singh of Ferozepur. The police said Sobar had purchased the snatched Maruti Suzuki Brezza car from the accused. Additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP-III) Sameer Verma said, “Surjeet and his son Puran are the kingpins. After taking away cars, they would first use them in executing more crimes, like snatching, and then sell them further. The accused were lodged in Ferozepur jail a few years ago where they met Sahib. About three years ago, when the father-son duo came out on bail, they opened a grocery store, but faced huge losses during the pandemic and went back to the crimes.” “The police have recovered a Mahindra Scorpio car (PB08-DE-3600) snatched on September 10, a Brezza car (HP20-G-6900) snatched on August 25, both cases from J Block of BRS Nagar, a Tata Indigo car (PB02-AZ-2850) stolen from Amritsar on August 28 and another Tata Indigo car (PB09-N-1165) stolen from Jalandhar on September 10. Besides, the police have also recovered a gold kara, a gold chain, two gold rings and two mobile phones snatched from the Scorpio car’s owner Nitin Wadhwani.

---||Vadodara||2020 saw least incidents of petty crimes in 21st century||Vadodara: As Gujaratis remained locked up in their houses for a greater part of 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, it proved to be the safest period for their properties in the 21st century. Only half of thefts, burglaries, robberies and dacoities were reported in 2020 in Gujarat compared to an average of the previous 19 years. The latest report of the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) titled Crime in India 2020 shows that there were 12,827 cases of theft, burglary, robbery and dacoity in the state, which is the lowest in the last two decades. Ahmedabad and Surat cities witnessed 4,602 incidents of these crimes. The drastic decline in these petty crimes which citizens face routinely is mainly due to the over two-month-long lockdown and also because of citizens restricting their movements even after the lockdown was lifted. Travel agents too confirmed that people had cancelled or did not plan trips during the festivities and vacations last year. Most of the house break-ins are reported during such periods. Vehicle thefts which contribute majorly to the thefts, also decreased as the most common places of such crimes like parks, gardens, offices among other places were also shut. Police sources said that the history-sheeters involved in such petty crimes too changed their habits as it was impossible for them to carry out any criminal activities. A lower rung official said that it was difficult for thieves as people were not venturing and their usual places of committing the crime were not as crowded as they used to be. “There was police presence and continuous patrolling on the roads to enforce the lockdown and night curfew, so it was not possible for the offenders to carry out crimes. After the curfew hours were eased, we devised new plans of patrolling during the early hours of the day,” said Dr Shamsher Singh, Vadodara police commissioner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/2020-saw-least-incidents-of-petty-crimes-in-21st-century/articleshow/86240797.cms||Jay Pachchigar

Gotyal said, “In view of the recent incident, the Ludhiana police held a meeting with the owners of all the 14 gunhouses and they have been asked to complete their register by September-end. In the October first week, the city police will cross-check the entries, which is a long process as we have to call each person to verify the details related to arms and ammunition.”“We also heard their issues, like some people had submitted their weapons with them and then went abroad. Their licences expired, but the weapon is still with the gunhouses. We will be resolving such issues too,” added Gotyal.Ashu Sharma, owner of a gunhouse near Bharat Nagar Chowk, said, “The commissioner of police had called us for a meeting and asked for assistance in nabbing those with illegal weapons. There are cases where people have not renewed their licences, and thus they are carrying illegal weapons. We have been asked to get details of all those with expired licences. They will be asked to submit their weapons immediately and get their licences renewed or cancelled.”“Public notices will also be issued about those with expired licences. If they fail to comply with the rules, FIRs will be lodged against them,” added Sharma. 29 forged entries in recordOn September 10, the police had arrested Gurcharan Kumar, owner of Verma Gun House near Nirankari Bhawan, for unlawfully selling cartridges to Kashish Adya, who was arrested by the Sahnewal police with an illegal weapon and live cartridges on September 1. During investigation, he had confessed that he had purchased the cartridges from Verma Gun House. Following this, the police initiated a separate probe. Deputy commissioner of police, investigation, SPS Dhindsa said, “When records of Verma Gun House were checked, the police found that there were at least 29 forged entries. As per the register, they had issued ammunition to licence-holders, but in reality they had sold it illegally at four to five times higher price. If a bullet costs Rs 100, the accused had sold it for Rs 400 to Rs 500. In the register, Gurcharan also had forged signatures of the licence-holders.”A fresh FIR was lodged against Gurcharan, his brother Shamsher Singh and father Girdhari Lal under sections 420 (cheating), 465 (punishment for forgery), 467 (forgery of valuable security, will, etc), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged document), 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC and under the Arms Act.Student held with illegal arm, ammoSahnewal SHO sub-inspector Balwinder Singh said after arresting Kashish, the police got information about his friend Simranjit Singh Sabi of BRS Nagar who is pursuing graduation from PCTE College.

Speaking at the Navbharat Navnirman Manch-Uttar Pradesh organised by Times Now Navbharat on Wednesday, Maurya said: “Just laying of foundation stone does not lead to completion of a project.

We have developed a network of roads for better connectivity. We are providing 24-hour power supply at district headquarters, for 18 hours at tehsil level and 16-18 hours in villages. Under the previous government, the daily average power supply in the state was four hours,” the deputy CM said. “What the Congress could not do since Independence, the double engine BJP government at the Centre and in Uttar Pradesh has done for the poor and marginalised,” he added. “We have been winning all the elections.

While asking the policemen to mend their ways, the senior officer warned of initiating action, including under relevant sections of the Indian Motor Vehicle Act. The letter, addressed to deputy superintendents of police and police station chiefs, asks them to ensure that silencers of such bikes are repaired on priority. Those failing to do so, would not only face action under the Motor Vehicle Act but their default report would also be sent to the SP’s office for further action. Pingale said that such modifications cause sound pollution and do not align with the image of the police. “Policemen becoming a source of inconvenience for citizens cannot be tolerated. Moreover, altering silencers violates the law and causes sound pollution,” Pingale said.

The ASI, in a letter dated June 14 to all district collectors in its Mumbai circle, had sought clarity on reopening historical monuments under its jurisdiction after the ASI headquarters in Delhi announced reopening of all monuments under its control from June 16 this year. But the ASI has received no response from the local authorities in this regard, officials said. The ASI had reopened over 3,000 monuments to the public on June 16. Following the announcement, state monuments like Ajanta-Ellora and Raigad Fort had reopened doors to visitors after the concerned district collectors granted conditional consent. But other historical sites have remained closed for the public. An ASI official said, “The ASI needs a written, no objection communication from the district authorities before reopening monuments as district collectors have such powers under the Disaster Management Act.” A top official from the Pune district administration, told TOI, “We are aware of this issue.

---||Noida||Loni farmers stage ‘zameen samadhi’, demand higher compensation for land||Ghaziabad: A group of farmers from Mandola in Ghaziabad’s Loni dug up trenches and sat on a ‘zameen samadhi’ on Wednesday seeking enhanced compensation for the 2,614-acre land that the Uttar Pradesh Housing Board had acquired from them under the Mandola Vihar Housing Scheme. As a part of the protest, organised under the aegis of Kisan Satyagraha Andolan (KSA), 17 farmers have entered waist-deep pits and threatened to stay put till their demands were met. “We have been protesting for more than four years but our demands have gone unheeded. So, we are left with no other option than to intensify the agitation. We will sit on ‘zameen samidhi’ till the authorities listen to us,” Manvendra Singh Teotia, a farmers’ leader, said.In 2010, the UP housing board had acquired 2,614 acres of land from 1,000 farmers under the Mandola Vihar Housing Scheme and compensation was paid at a mutually agreed rate of Rs 1,100 per sq metre. So far, a total compensation of Rs 1,109 crore has been paid to 94% of the farmers.According to Ghaziabad ADM (administration) Ritu Suhas, farmers are demanding four times the land rate, in keeping with the Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013. “We are ready for talks with the agitating farmers, but now they have clubbed their demands to the three farm laws knowing fully well that it is not in our hands but for the central government to decide,” she said.Suhas said the ‘zameen samadhi’ was an attempt to put pressure on the administration. “We held talks with the farmers on Wednesday but without any results. They are being invited for a fresh round of talks with the Ghaziabad district magistrate now. We hope to end the impasse very soon,” Suhas added.The KSA has been demanding a minimum support price (MSP) on 23 crops around the year. While it has extended support to the Samyukta Kisan Morcha’s agitation against the farm laws, the KSA, Teotia said, were not demanding a repeal of the three laws.According to Neeraj Tyagi, one of the farmers sitting on ‘zameen samadhi’, their prime land was taken away for a pittance. “We are demanding enhanced compensation under the Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013. Our ‘zameen samadhi’ will continue indefinitely and till that time protesters will remain in the trench round-the-clock. Sevenarmers are also on hunger strike,” Tyagi said.An official from UP Housing Board, meanwhile, said, “The notification for the project came out in 1998 and compensation as per the Land Acquisition Act prevailing at that time has already been paid to most of the farmers. The Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, came much later and is not applicable to this project.”As per the scheme, 11,000 housing units are to be constructed on the land in 15 years. The housing board had started work in 2007, but it has been stalled due to the ongoing farmers’ agitation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/loni-farmers-stage-zameen-samadhi-demand-higher-compensation-for-land/articleshow/86245484.cms||Abhijay Jha

It should be ensured that the wife does not report to the husband or even the children do not report to their father. It should not become a family affair,” a senior official said. The GAD-led by chief secretary Sitaram Kunte promulgated a brief order to give effect to the policy decision taken by the state government. It has stated that while issuing posting and transfer orders, employees should not report to their first relatives. As a result, now it will not be possible to post husband, wife or their children in the same department. The order may appear to be routine one, but it assumes significance as it will end monopoly of certain families in key government departments. “There is scope of nepotism and corruption, therefore it was felt that husband and wife should not be posted in the same department,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/couples-kids-should-not-be-posted-in-same-govt-dept-gad/articleshow/86245552.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

Police units across the state were divided into three categories depending on the annual cases registered with them. In the category of less than 6,000 cases annually, Aurangabad rural and Raigad have been adjudged the best units. Gadchiroli has won the best use of technology and best community policing awards in this category. In the category of over 6,000 cases, Pune and Nagpur city police units have been declared the best. Beed police bagged the award for community policing initiatives. Last year, the DGP office took the initiative to screen each police unit under different parameters and compare them with other units for the work done between January and December 2020. Aurangabad rural superintendent of police Mokshada Patil credited the constabulary and all subordinates for the award. “We’ve ensured better work ethics and focused on basic policing since 2019. We’ve worked meticulously; in a result-oriented way. It is heartening to see this acknowledgement,” she told TOI. The awards were announced on Tuesday evening by ADG (L&O) Rajendra Singh. Beed police bagged the community policing award. The then SP, Harssh Poddar, said, “Seven different community policing projects were launched in Beed last year. All of them focused on vulnerable sections of society - combating domestic violence & child labour, securing senior citizens & working women, creating awareness among students & citizens and counselling for depression and suicide. Each of these projects was headed by an SDPO rank officer through detailed SOPs and monitored by the SP Office.” Kolhapur was credited for its use of technology in policing. Kolhapur SP Shailesh Balkawade told TOI they had sent details of three technology initiatives. “First was the ‘Suvidha’ portal that helps the complainants track the complaint and puts the onus on the police to resolve it on time. Second was use of QR code system for patrolling. Third was regarding use of technology to trace those entering Kolhapur district during the first wave of Covid pandemic,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aurangabad-rural-kolhapur-beed-bag-police-unit-awards/articleshow/86238218.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Vaibhav, along with Kumar Satyadarshi (AIR 11) from Begusarai, also had the honour of scoring 100 percentile with 42 other candidates across the country. The results of the final merit list based on the performances of the four JEE (Mains) were announced by the National Testing Agency (NTA) late Tuesday evening. Richa Kumari with 99.88 percentile emerged the state topper in the girl’s category. Vaibhav cracked the exam in his second attempt and has been studying for 15 hours a day to clear the JEE (Advanced). “My aim is to get admission in the computer science at IIT-Bombay. I solve as many question papers and practice papers as possible every day for that,” he said. His father Prabhakar Kumar works for an insurance company and mother Madhuri Mishra is a homemaker. They were elated over their son’s success. Satyadarshi, from Pokharia in Begusarai, said he had never dreamt of becoming the top scorer in the exam. “I am very happy that my hard work paid off. I had started focusing on JEE exam when I was in Class X. After the Class X board exam, I moved to Kota for the preparation of JEE. After the Covid-induced lockdown, I returned home and focused only on my studies. I took the lockdown period in a positive way and devoted most of my time to self-study,” he said. The boy, who secured 94.6% in Class XII this year, said he had never took studies to clear a competitive exam. “I try to understand things and memorise the concept and formulas. I want to explore more in the field of science, especially quantum physics. Right now, I am focusing on JEE (Advanced),” Satyadarshi told this newspaper on Wednesday. His father Ramvilas Kumar is a headmaster in the Government Middle School at Sahebpur Kamal in Begusarai and mother Preeta Kumari is a homemaker. Sayadarshi has already got admission in the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru. “I got the admission on the acquired percentile in JEE Main. I got 100 percentile in mathematics and 99.97 percentile each in physics and chemistry. However, I still want to appear for the JEE (Advanced) only to see how capable I am,” the boy said. The eligible candidates will appear for the JEE (Advanced) scheduled on October 3. It is a one-stop exam to get admission in the 23 premier Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/sitamarhi-boy-shares-air-1-with-17-others-in-jee-main/articleshow/86243125.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Lucknow||Misinterpreted on leaving UP, angry at Owaisi not Yogi: Rana||Lucknow: Two months after Urdu poet Munawwar Rana allegedly said that he would leave the state if Yogi came to power, on Wednesday he cleared the air and stated,“meri narazgi Yogi se nahi Owaisi se hai”. Speaking at the Navbharat Navnirman Manch - Uttar Pradesh organised by Times Now Navbharat, the 68-year-old poet who is mostly confined to a wheelchair due to age-related ailments, said, “I was misinterpreted. What I meant was that if Yogi returns to power because of AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi, then I would leave UP. I am not outraged at Yogi but Owaisi. Uttar Pradesh is known for its Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb, it doesn’t need Owaisi. He does politics to only appease Muslims and widen the gap in the social fabric. If Owaisi manages to form a government in UP by winning 100 seats, I would prefer to leave the state.” However, Bhojpuri actor and member of Parliament from northeast Delhi Manoj Tiwari said, “We won’t let Rana Sahab leave UP...Yogiji will return to power.” “When Ranaji himself has explained his stand, then there is no point in discussing it as thousands of Hindus love him, including fans like me,” said Tiwari. During the event, Rana also recited a poem and said, “If I die, my mortal remains won’t go to Karachi.” The poet further said, “I am more Hindustani than any hardcore Hindutva follower. In early 90s, I once told a Pakistani national after a ghazal programme that I live in protection of 80 crore Hindus. In 1992, when communal tension was simmering, the gates to our lawns were open at 5am every day for Hindu daughters to pluck flowers to offer to a deity in a nearby temple. However, today’s situation has changed. How can I appreciate my Uttar Pradesh when I see a minor girl in Kanpur pleading for mercy with tearful eyes when a mob is attacking her Muslim father.” Commenting on the ‘Abbajaan’ controversy, the poet said, “Abbajaan (father) is for everyone, the way maa (mother) is for everyone and so is bhai (brother).” He added, “Instead of taking pictures of Mamata Banerjee’s city’s flyover (Maa flyover in Kolkata), it would have been better had they used pictures of bridges, roads and flyovers constructed under the Akhilesh Yadav regime as they are UP’s property.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/misinterpreted-on-leaving-up-angry-at-owaisi-not-yogi-rana/articleshow/86247313.cms||Arvind Chauhan
---||Aurangabad||OBC quota: BJP workers block traffic, detained||Aurangabad: Members of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) were detained by the police on Tuesday after they blocked traffic at Kranti Chowk road while holding an agitation demanding restoration of OBC quota in local elections. According to the police, the agitation was held in violation of pandemic-related norms and agitators disrupted traffic on the busy route. Following the agitation, Kranti Chowk police registered a case against BJP’s district unit president Sanjay Kenekar, MLA Atul Save, office bearers Basavraj Mangrule, Sameer Rajurkar and others on the charge of wrongful restraint, disobeying orders duly promulgated by authorities, unlawfully, negligently and malignantly doing an act which is likely to spread any disease dangerous to life. In addition, the agitators were also named in cases registered under relevant sections of the Maharashtra Police Act. Senior police inspector Ganpat Darade said that 40 people have been booked. “While trying to open the road blockade caused by the agitators, they were detained and taken to the police station. Notices were issued while asking them to remain present before the court of law,” said Darade. Later, Kenekar said, “The state government has failed the OBC community by not filing its reply in the Supreme Court and eventually causing cancellation of reservation.” Echoing his views, MLA Save said, “If the OBCs do not get any reservation in electoral politics, they will not only lose representation but will also lose their voice.” He blamed the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi for the current situation. The allegations made during the agitation have been termed as a farce by Shiv Sena. MLC Ambadas Danve said, “BJP should have the courtesy to speak about the data that has not been submitted by the central government to the court.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/obc-quota-bjp-workers-block-traffic-detained/articleshow/86238210.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Rajkot||Gujarat: From deputy collector’s office, she pursues IAS dream||RAJKOT: ‘Bachpan se dukhon ka itna bhoj uthaya hai ... ki ab aur bhoj uthane ki himmat nahi rahi’ — (Face so much hardship since childhood, that I don’t have the courage to take anymore) a dialogue that probably led a Class X girl to make a life changing decision subconsciously, even as she sat glued watching Bollywood blockbuster movie, Sooryavansham. She knew she wanted to be a ‘collectorni’ and Hiral Bhalala firmed up her mind to crack the IAS exams one day. And, brick by brick the minor girl built the foundation of her dream, in spite of the hardships that she had to face in every step as the daughter of a construction labourer. However, all her dedication fructified when last week she cracked the Gujarat Public Service Commission (GPSC) exam, but even as she is waiting for her appointment as deputy collector, Hiral hasn’t lost sight of her penultimate goal — become an IAS officer. Hiral Bhalala (extreme right) with her mother and siblingsHiral’s father Bakulbhai is a native of Amreli and he moved to Surat as a construction worker where the entire family, including Hiral and two siblings, lived. “Hiral, my eldest daughter has been good at her studies since childhood. I am proud that she has become a class one officer,” said Bakulbhai who had to return to his native in Dadhiya village of Savarkundla taluka after work dried up in Surat owing to the pandemic and lockdown. Bakulbhai earned a meagre Rs150 per day in Surat, but when that too stopped coming, he went back to his native and took up farming for the past two years, while his children continued to study in Surat. “She (Hiral) knew my financial situation and did not spend money on education,” the proud father told TOI. Hiral studied in Gujarati medium both in Surat and Ahmedabad. She secured 90 percent in class 10, but such was their hardship that her marksheets were held as her school fees were pending. Despite wanting to take up science, to do engineering after class 12, she opted for commerce and luck smiled on her when she got a scholarship in college. “I tried for UPSC once, but could not crack preliminary exam as the qualifying paper is based on mathematics. I prepared well thereafter and now am again going to take the exam,” said Hiral, who has opted Gujarati literature as her optional subject for UPSC. She took GPSC prelims in October 2019, but Covid delayed the mains which was conducted in March 2021. Her interview was conducted in August.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/amreli-labourers-daughter-cracks-civil-services-exams/articleshow/86240674.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

The woman stated in her complaint that she wed the man, 25, according to wishes of her family on February 27 this year. Soon after their marriage, her husband and in-laws began harassing her for not bringing dowry, she alleged in the FIR. The woman said that her husband and she had sex for around 10 days after their marriage and later he stopped having sex with her. “My husband stopped having sex with me and whenever we were together in our bedroom, he used to behave strangely with me. When I asked for sex, he used to beat me badly and even left me alone in my bedroom,” she alleged in the FIR. She alleged that her husband told her that he did not like her appearance, and he would have sex with some other woman. Aggrieved with this, she had left his house on August 1 after which her family members and her in-laws made a compromise and sent her back to her husband’s house. She said that her family members sent her back to her husband’s house as her in-laws assured her parents that they would not misbehave with her. But when she returned to her husband’s home, they again began harassing her and her husband continued to avoid her. She alleged that her husband abandoned her on August 8 and left her at her parents’ place. Later, she approached police and filed a complaint of domestic violence against her husband and in-laws.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/woman-deprived-of-sex-beaten-by-husband/articleshow/86243170.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Netas welcome state’s ordinance decision on OBC quota||Nagpur: The state government on Tuesday took two crucial decisions related to political and job reservation for OBCs. The state has decided to issue an ordinance for OBC political reservations for the upcoming local body polls while keeping the 50% overall limit intact. The second decision was to increase quota for OBC in Class III and IV category jobs in eight districts where tribal population was more. Regarding the ordinance, leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis said, “I welcome the decision by the state government but the job is not done yet. In fact, this should have been done in December 2019 when the Supreme Court had mentioned about this. Anyway, now we have to move ahead and complete the triple test mandated by the SC and work on getting the empirical report ready.” He added that the state government must also work on how political reservation can be provided to OBCs in future as the bypolls scheduled for next month are too close. Senior BJP leader Chandrashekhar Bawankule said the state government finally seems to have woken up. “They are simply trying to be smart and do something for aesthetic value. All this (ordinance) could have been done earlier too but the government let it drag on,” said Bawankule. OBC leader Babanrao Taywade said, “The bottom line is that the state government cannot grant political reservation of 27% to OBCs because it will breach the 50% limit. So, now it is up to the central government to amend the Constitution and increase this limit,” said Taywade. He has also decided to resign as the member of the State OBC Commission saying the ball is in the Centre’s court. On job reservations, Taywade said, “I thank the state government for the decision related to jobs for Class III and Class IV category as we have been fighting for it since last seven years. In these eight districts, the OBC job quota was taking a hit because of the high tribal population. While I have not gone into the details of how exactly OBC applicants shall be accommodated, I still welcome the decision because it shows the state’s willingness to listen to citizens.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/netas-welcome-states-ordinance-decision-on-obc-quota/articleshow/86240685.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

He was speaking at the 19th convocation ceremony of Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology (VNIT) on Wednesday. “We, most importantly institutes like VNIT, have to work for ‘gaon, gareeb, mazdoor, kisan’,” he said. The ceremony was held in the virtual mode for the second year in a row on the occasion of Engineers’ Day to commemorate the birth anniversary of Bharat Ratna Sir Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya. Gadkari was the chief guest for the ceremony while Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) secretary and Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) director general Shekhar Mande was the guest of honour. Speaking about how institutes can contribute for development and creating employment potential, Gadkari said, “In Vidarbha, Gadchiroli district is socially, economically and educationally backward. Amravati’s Melghat region faces the problem of malnutrition. 80% of Maharashtra’s minerals and forest areas are available in Vidarbha. Research and technology in this region by institutes can play a key role.” “If knowledge can be transferred to the educationally and economically backward and a sustainable life is created for them, it will be a great achievement for the institution,” the minister said. Gadkari shed light on road engineering & safety and invited the students for cooperation in the social and national interest. He said, “I need your help in reducing road accidents in Vidarbha. Nagpur sees 250 deaths every year due to accidents. Educated students can contribute in designing road construction projects and providing suggestions on how we can save lives.” Addressing the graduating students, Mande said, “Due to the pandemic, we are stepping into a world that has set many new normals which are abounding with new challenges and opportunities. Modern science, technology and engineering have pole vaulted humans to unthinkable levels. Today, we enjoy the benefit from the fruits of science, technology and engineering at almost every moment.” He added, “The future of India and humanity is in your hands and I’m sure you will rise to the challenges and lead through inventions, innovations and entrepreneurship.” VNIT director and board of governors chairman Pramod Padole presented the institute’s report and delivered the chairman’s address. He highlighted the achievements of students and contribution of VNIT Alumni Association (VNITAA). Padole thanked VNITAA for their efforts during the pandemic like providing oxygen cylinders, oxygen concentrators, medical equipment etc to public and charitable healthcare institutions in the city. Padole said the institute awarded 49 degrees in doctorate of philosophy, 333 in master of technology, 60 in master of science, 634 in bachelor of technology in various engineering disciplines and 59 in bachelor of architecture. He added, “This year, VNIT is felicitating students and research scholars with 46 medals and numerous awards for academic meritorious achievement.” Poonam Sharma conducted the programme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/research-tech-by-institutes-in-backward-areas-can-play-key-role/articleshow/86240617.cms||---

I am here to break the record,” Yogi declared, while speaking at the Navbharat Navnirman Manch-Uttar Pradesh, organised by Times Now Navbharat. “As per the current trend, BJP is not going to get less than 350 seats. The party will fight the election on the agenda of development and nationalism,” the CM said.

He must have been told by the survey team that SP is behind on 400 seats. However, he said the wrong thing. He knows who is coming to power.” “UP has benefitted from BJP’s double-engine government at the Centre and in the state. Development over the last four-and-a-half years has been more than what was delivered by the Congress, SP and BSP governments put together. In the coming election, we should be able to talk about our works like public welfare schemes and employment,” he said. Yogi said ‘rashtra dharma’ was important and one should be dedicated to the country. “We have been successful because our schemes were for all and not aimed at benefiting a caste or community,” he added. Downplaying the change of guard in various states, including Gujarat, the CM said: “BJP is a democratic party and its culture is that the party is bigger than the person and the country is bigger than the party. BJP has a style of functioning and does not believe in parivarwad (nepotism). Party workers do whatever they are asked to do. Post is not important, work is.” Hitting out at the Opposition, the CM said that SP was known for loot and misrule. “If they are supporting minorities, why didn’t SP speak out against triple talaq and why no action was taken against its legislator who supported Taliban? People will reject SP which is sympathising with those who illegally occupied properties,” Yogi said. “My government withdrew cases filed in connection with the Muzaffarnagar riots because SP had sponsored the riots and filed fake cases against innocent people. The action should have been taken much earlier,” he added. Yogi said Mayawati was forced to publicly declare that if elected, she would not build any more statues of herself but focus on development. Attacking the Congress, he said: “When Rahul Gandhi goes to Kerala, he speaks against UP. When he goes abroad, he speaks against the country.” Read AlsoAIMIM plans capital foray, to contest Delhi local electionsAfter opening its account in Maharashtra, Gujarat and Karnataka local bodies polls, Asaduddin Owaisi’s All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) is all set to expand its footprint in Delhi by contesting the municipal corporation elections in the state.Asked about AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi’s entry into UP politics, the CM remarked that he had come from ‘Bhagyanagar’ and was free to try his bhagya (luck) in UP. He lashed out at his critics who claim that the government mismanaged the Covid-19 crisis and said there were different kinds of flu that plagued the country since 1947 (like dengue and swine flu) but no vaccine or medicine could be made available for it. On the recent ban on the sale of meat and alcohol in Mathura, the CM said Mathura was one of the seven most important pilgrimage sites for Hindus and the decision was based on people’s demand. “In any case, if people are vegetarian they will remain healthy. People can do what they want in their homes but not in public places,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/will-break-35-yr-jinx-return-to-power-in-2022-in-up-yogi/articleshow/86247334.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Business||Tata Sons, group led by SpiceJet chief bid for Air India||MUMBAI/NEW DELHI: Tata Sons and a grouping led by SpiceJet chairman Ajay Singh placed financial offers for Air India on Wednesday, the last day to submit bids. Tata Sons made the offer through its 100% arm Talace Private Ltd while Singh placed the financial bids in his personal capacity along with some investment funds, it is learned. In a tweet, the department of investment and public asset management, without revealing names of the parties, said financial bids for Air India were received by the transaction adviser. "Process now moves to concluding stage," it said. Tata Sons confirmed its participation to TOI. EY is the transaction adviser to the government on Air India's disinvestment. The Centre will soon set a floor price for the sale of the airline. Whoever quotes the highest bid over the floor price will claim the national carrier. The government hopes to wrap up the sale of AI this year, marking a major milestone in the country's privatisation programme. It has taken nearly 20 years for the cash guzzling airline to be sold.The Centre will soon set a floor price for the sale of the airline. Whoever quotes the highest bid over the floor price will claim the national carrier. But the winner will also have to meet security audit standards. Air India has a debt of over Rs 43,000 crore, of which Rs 23,287 crore will be retained on its books while the rest will be transferred to Air India Asset Holdings, an entity incorporated to house non-aviation assets. On Tuesday, Tata Sons shareholders had approved a fund-raise programme of Rs 40,000 crore via non-convertible debentures to finance acquisitions and invest in businesses. Tata Sons - which operates Vistara and AirAsia India - is considered the frontrunner for Air India, according to industry observers. The company originally promoted Air India in 1932 but sold its interests to the government in 1953. Its financial bid signals its commitment to the air transport business. The purchase will scale up its ambition of emerging as a significant player in the aviation sector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tata-sons-group-led-by-spicejet-chief-bid-for-air-india/articleshow/86248872.cms||Reeba Zachariah

---||Delhi||Restaurant, bar owners urge Delhi HC to allow sale of herbal hookahs, stop action against them||NEW DELHI: Several restaurant and bar owners on Wednesday urged Delhi High Court to allow sale of herbal flavoured hookahs and restrain authorities from taking any coercive steps against them. The plea was, however, opposed by Delhi government that said use of hookah, be it with or without tobacco, in all public places, including hotels, restaurants, eatery houses, bars, pubs and discotheques, in the national capital was strictly prohibited as use or sharing of hookah might further increase spread of Covid-19. Justice Rekha Palli said she would examine the matter on the next date, as the counsel for petitioner restaurants and bars said he would file an additional affidavit. “They (Delhi government) have a problem with shared hookah, which could lead to spread of Covid-19. If 40 people are using 10 hookahs, it is a problem,” the court pointed out. The petitioners, however, submitted that as long as restaurants undertake not to use nicotine in hookah, they cannot be prohibited from carrying out their businesses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/restaurant-bar-owners-urge-hc-to-allow-sale-of-herbal-hookahs-stop-action-against-them/articleshow/86243284.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Dissent within LDF comes out in open over agenda||Thiruvananthapuram: Lack of consensus among the allies regarding key decisions was spilled out in the open during the council meeting held on Tuesday, posing fresh issues for Mayor Arya Rajendran. Three heads of standing committees - S Salim, D R Anil and Jameela Sreedharan – had to face questions during the council forcing some corrections in the items on the agenda. Surprisingly it came from Palayam Rajan, one of the senior councillors of the ruling party. Welfare committee chairman S Salim, who was already preoccupied with a bevy of grievances from opposition councillors regarding disbursal of welfare pension, was caught unawares when Palayam Rajan brought up the matter of serious delay in processing of files. Salim had almost started defending the corporation staff when Rajan explained in detail about some of the files which have been pending for two to three years. Welfare committee chairman eventually got away with the reply that the matter had come to their notice and would be settled soon. When everyone thought the ordeal was over, Rajan then picked on Jameela Sreedharan on the agenda regarding weighing bridges for transportation of dry waste. Soon after Jameela Sreedharan was grilled by the BJP citing lack of clarity in the agenda, Rajan piled on her misery and said one shall not conclude the matter of arranging weighing bridges by merely saying that the secretary was entrusted to look into it. “It is not a good practice. There should be a clear explanation as to where and how weighing bridges will operate,” he did not mince his words. Jameela Sreedharan, who was rattled by the sudden onslaught, came up with a reply that the corporation did not intend to install weighing bridges, but would find some private parties who already run it. Works standing committee chairman D R Anil, who is also the parliamentary party leader, was also not spared. As he presented the agenda on reconstituting what he read as a committee to monitor electrical works, Rajan went to the extent of correcting him. “It is not a committee, as is shown on the agenda it is a panel,” he said. Rajan further portrayed the shortcomings of the panel. “The members of this panel charge their remuneration at 2% of the actual work estimate. So the more the estimate, the more money they earn. This could result in exorbitant estimates,” he said indicating the fallacy of reconstituting the panel. Rajan also suggested the members of the panel be taken on daily wage basis and the matter may be forwarded to the state government along with another agenda on creation of new posts. Sources in the council said such open expression of dissent does not reflect well on the LDF. “It clearly shows a lack of understanding and trust. Normally parliamentary party meetings are held to win the trust of each senior councillor before presenting important decisions. Dissent is being openly expressed in the council because such discussions may not be happening anymore,” a source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/dissent-within-ldf-comes-out-in-open-over-agenda/articleshow/86243309.cms||Aswin J Kumar

In this case, the woman had filed a habeas corpus petition through advocate Deepmala Desai for custody of the child to be handed over from her husband. The HC ordered the husband to go and stay at his wife’s residence for a few days with the child. He was ordered to leave the child with the mother for a month. However, four days after the HC order, the man took the girl away and went missing. The police told that court the man’s mobile number was traced in Uttar Pradesh. The HC was furious with his behaviour and ordered the police to launch a search. The man was finally located in a remote corner of Ahmedabad. He along with the child was brought to the court, where he admitted to having remarried. The bench of Justice A J Desai and Justice Nirzar Desai ordered the man to immediately hand over custody of his daughter to the woman. The high court has, however, granted visitation rights to the father. While granting child’s custody to the mother, the court ordered the Odhav police inspector to ensure that some woman officer regularly visits the residence of the mother for a period of six months. The HC has also permitted the man and woman to approach appropriate court for permanent custody of the child.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/mother-gets-childs-custody-after-husband-vanished/articleshow/86243308.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Purvanchal, B’khand expressways will be inaugurated this year: Yogi||Lucknow: Projecting expressways as not just roads but the backbone of UP’s economy, CM Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday said the state government would make two big infrastructure projects – Purvanchal Expressway and Bundelkhand Expressway – will open this year. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate Purvanchal Expressway in October and Bundelkhand Expressway by November-end. We will also urge the PM to perform bhumi pujan for the Ganga Expressway soon. By November 30, we should also be ready to roll out the first phase of Kanpur Metro,” the CM said, while speaking at the ‘Navbharat Navnirman Manch-Uttar Pradesh’ organised by Times Now Navbharat on Wednesday. Coming down heavily on the Opposition for asking what his government has done for the development of UP, the CM gave example of various infrastructure projects which his government has initiated. “Development has never been the part of opposition’s agenda. Before 2017, there were two expressways in UP. There was no Metro in any city. Congress was in power for so many years but never thought of public transport,” he said. “Even if projects were conceptualised under previous governments, they did nothing to push them and actual work took place under the BJP government,” he said. Giving the example of Purvanchal Expressway, the CM said its initial cost was Rs 15,200 crore under the SP government but when it was re-tendered in 2018, its cost came down to Rs 11,800 crore. “The opposition is not able to digest the fact that we are delivering on our promises. Our work is speaking for itself. Earlier, Bundelkhand was the centre of exploitation but now two airports are coming up, one each in Lalitpur and Chitrakoot. Tap water will be provided to each house by the end of December. Two nodes under the defence corridor have been given to Bundelkhand. UP was known for potholes, now people know they have entered UP as soon as four-lane roads start,” he said. “Before 2017, unemployment rate was over 17% but it has come down to 4%. In 2015-16, the state’s economy was ranked 6th but now is second after Maharashtra,” he said, adding the UP Investors’ Summit was the first to be organised in the state and projects worth over Rs 3 lakh crore were already seen on the ground. “So far, we have given 4.5 lakh government jobs. These were on posts which previous governments could have filled but they had no such intention. In fact, due to corruption in appointments, the courts had to stay the process. When I came to power, there were 1.37 lakh posts vacant in police department and I was told that the Supreme Court had stayed the appointments because it were based on favouritism. Our system has been completely transparent,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/purvanchal-bkhand-expressways-will-be-inaugurated-this-year-yogi/articleshow/86247340.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Delhi||A 66% high: Excise reforms may net Delhi govt Rs 10,000 crore per year||NEW DELHI: From November 17, modern and bigger liquor stores will start opening across the capital to offer enhanced buying experience to Delhiites and garner more revenues under Delhi government’s new excise policy. To facilitate this move, all existing private liquor shops will shut down from October 1, which will be followed by the closure of government shops. The government revenue collection has been 23% lower than the budget estimates this financial year primarily due to Covid-19 restrictions. Delhi government estimates to earn Rs 10,000 annually under the new arrangement as against the 2021-22 budget estimate of Rs 6,000 crore. The reforms, which were approved on April 15, also aim to check excise tax evasion. Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said on Wednesday that the government would receive Rs 3,500 crore extra revenues in the next 12 months due to the reforms. According to the government, Delhi will not face any liquor shortage during the nearly one-month transition period as all government liquor shops will remain open till November 16. The licence of around 260 private liquor vends will not be renewed after September 30. Delhi government has divided the city into 32 excise zones for retail sale and earned Rs 8,911 crore as licence fees, as against Rs 7,039 crore base reserve fees, for 850 liquor vends. “No liquor shop’s window will now face the road. The counter will be within the premises of the shop, which will be minimum 500 sq ft. Shopkeepers will have to install CCTV cameras and ensure there is no liquor consumption in the open,” Sisodia said. Each zone will have 27 airconditioned liquor vends with walk-in facilities. Sisodia stressed that Delhi government had received 41% less revenue than the estimated amount in the financial year 2020-21. “In the current financial year, the GST collection decreased by 23%, VAT collection by 25%, excise collection by 30%, stamp collection by 16% and motor vehicle tax collection by 19%,” he stated. “The government is withholding most of the expenses for now, except salaries and Covid-related expenses,” said Sisodia, who is also the finance minister. Delhi has around 850 legal liquor shops and around 2,000 illegal facilities. In its continuous crackdown on illegal liquor, the government has seized around 7 lakh bottles of liquor and 1,000 vehicles in one year and lodged 1,864 FIRs. “Despite all these actions, tax evasion was prevalent. So, we have converted all taxes into licence fees. The government will earn Rs 10,000 crore while it was getting Rs 6,900 crore earlier. This will confirm the government’s estimation that the liquor mafia are evading taxes at a big scale,” Sisodia said. The minister also pointed out that while Delhi contributed Rs 1,40,000 crore to central taxes, it got only Rs 325 crore from the Centre as grants in aid as against 42% share received by states. “Delhi government’s revenue will further reduce by Rs 8,000 crore as the Centre is going to stop sharing GST compensation from next year,” he added. Under the new policy, Sisodia said, excise duty and VAT have been converted into licence fees. “Till now the licence fee was Rs 8-10 lakh, then 250-300% excise fees and VAT. We have hiked the licence fees to Rs 6.5-7 crore per shop, and increased it by 10% before the tendering,” he clarified.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/a-66-high-excise-reforms-may-net-govt-rs-10000cr/yr/articleshow/86243337.cms||AlokKNMishra

As Calorx Education and Research Foundation was refused new recognition to run the school citing the controversy as well as for running the schools on a false NOC from the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), it submitted in the high court that those trustees, who were facing allegations, will not be part of the new trust. The high court ordered the Foundation to place on record the memorandum of association and relevant documents on court record showing the trustees of the earlier school, who were facing criminal charges, have been removed from the new trust. The court has sought the documents by Friday. The Foundation has submitted that the education department has refused new recognition to run the school even after the trust paid Rs 50 lakh fine as imposed by the government while cancelling earlier recognition. The education authorities maintained that the school kept on running education activities even after its recognition was revoked. It was argued that the trust continued to impart education online at its own cost during the pandemic and did not admit a single student. The order in the appeal made by the trust reads that the trust has met all the requirements for obtaining recognition for the school.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/dps-east-drops-tainted-trustees-seeks-recognition/articleshow/86243347.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Cab driver pleads guilty in hit & run, but retrial ordered||MUMBAI: In a rare instance, a sessions court overturned the verdict of a magistrate court even though the 60-year-old cab driver pleaded guilty to injuring an 88-year-old man in a hit-and-run incident at Girgaon in 2019. A retrial has been ordered. Iqbal Ansari was sentenced to eight days’ imprisonment in 2019. The defence told the sessions court that Ansari was not told that he could be sentenced and pleaded guilty while seeking to be let off with a fine. When an accused pleads guilty he forfeits the right to a trial and a subsequent appeal, except to the extent or legality of the sentence. But ruling in favour of Ansari, the sessions court said as he was not represented through an advocate when the verdict was pronounced by the magistrate’s court, the hearing should have been postponed. “...order passed by trial court is not legal. Trial court should have given opportunity to prosecution to justify the chargesheet against the appellant (Ansari), and after giving opportunity to the accused should have passed suitable order... interference is required at the hands of this court,” the sessions court said. “As per chargesheet on seeing CCTV footage, police identified only the taxi number and not driver. Trial court did not go through chargesheet to find out if it was filed against correct person,” the court said. It said matter was to be remanded back to magistrate’s court to give a chance to the prosecution to justify the chargesheet against the accused through argument or by evidence, and to try the matter as per law. “Trial court should not be influenced by this court’s observations, and try the matter on its own merit,” the sessions court said. The prosecution said on January 23, 2019, at 10am, the victim was walking towards C P Tank, when a taxi rammed into him. The victim was injured and an FIR was filed. The defence said investigating officer got CCTV footage and found the cab number. The owner was Mohammed Sattar but the chargesheet was filed against Ansari.

---||Nagpur||Covid wary public speeds up sale of private vehicles||Nagpur: The city has seen a northward trend in sale of private vehicles — four-wheelers and two-wheelers — in the first five months of the current fiscal. There has been a 2.6 times increase in registration of new vehicles during April 1-August 31 this financial year as compared to the corresponding period of the last fiscal. Nagpur city has a vehicle population of over 18.52 lakh. According to vehicle registration data, in all 19,809 new vehicles, including 17,933 private vehicles, were registered from April 1 to August 31 this year at Regional Transport Office (City) and Dy RTO (east) in the city. During the same period last year, in all 7,066 new vehicles, including 6,676 private vehicles, were registered. An official in the motor vehicles department said that in 2020, there was a drop in vehicle registration due to restrictions imposed after the Covid-19 outbreak, which adversely affected the revenue of RTOs. According to Satish Kumar, a sales manager with a four-wheeler company in the city, in order to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour, more citizens have started using private vehicles while there is less preference for public transport facilities such as city buses and Metro. “Sale of cars and two wheelers in Nagpur is slowly increasing to prevent the spread of Covid-19,” said Kumar. The data obtained from City RTO and east DyRTO revealed that more four-wheelers have been sold in the city as compared to two-wheelers in the first five months of the last three financial years. In 2019-20 (April 1 to August 31), both the transport department offices had registered 5,065 cars, while during the same period in 2020-21, it saw sale of 2,168. In the current fiscal (2021-2022), 5,495 four-wheelers were registered with both the offices. Representatives of finance companies in the city too stated that the demand for vehicle loans has picked up. “We are seeing good demand, especially for four-wheelers and two-wheelers,” said Rajnish Verma from a private financial firm. However, traffic experts feel more private vehicles means increase in congestion on city roads and blamed it on poor public transport system in the city. The NMC has a fleet of 400 Aapli buses but is operating only 290. “This is being done to curb losses on public transport. This attitude will prove costly in the long run. Air and noise pollution as well as travel time will increase,” said traffic activist Raju Wagh and added that the city is already witnessing a steep rise in road accidents. The Rural RTO too has witnessed steep rise in sale of new vehicles. Against 6,638 vehicles in five months of 2020-21, it registered 13,803 new vehicles during the same period this financial year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-wary-public-speeds-up-sale-of-private-vehicles/articleshow/86240832.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Yogi Adityanath, a monk with vision for economy, says MSME minister Sidharth Nath Singh||LUCKNOW: Crediting the Yogi Adityanath government for growing confidence of investors in UP over the last four years, MSME minister Sidharth Nath Singh said the Chief Minister is a “monk with an economic model” who has catapulted Uttar Pradesh among top states in terms of GDP. Speaking at a session on ‘UP as an emerging investment hub’ during the Navbharat Navnirman Manch-Uttar Pradesh organised by Times Now Navbharat, Singh said the state had developed a massive network of connectivity. “At least seven airports are functional and work is underway on four others, including the Jewar Airport. Construction of Bundelkhand Expressway and Ganga Expressway to link all parts of the state is also on,” he said. “The purchasing power of a person in UP has gone up from Rs 45,000 to Rs 88,000 since the BJP came to power. There are misconceptions about Yogiji considering his background and robes, but he has a vision and has managed to change the state in ways which even economists did not understand,” Singh said, adding the government was treating investors as stakeholders in the state’s development. Co-chairperson of Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), UP Chapter, Vinamra Agarwal said over the last four-and-a-half years, the message which the government had been consistently enforcing with industrialists was that they were brand ambassadors of UP and partners in the state’s development.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/yogi-a-monk-with-vision-for-economy-msme-minister/articleshow/86247352.cms||Neha Lalchandani
---||Delhi||As Delhi moves to new regime, restaurants fret about liquor shortage for two months||NEW DELHI: While there is excitement about the resumption of retail operation by new licensees from November 17, for the moment restaurants and customers are facing a liquor supply crunch. While brands have been in short supply for a few weeks, there is also a worry among restaurants about alcohol for the next two months. Some customers TOI spoke to confirmed that local liquor stores and restaurants did not have brands of their choice available. A liquor store owner in west Delhi, who is not among the new licence holders, has to shut his shop by this month-end. He said most vendors like him weren’t investing in new stock and were aiming to exhaust their inventory before exiting the market. Availability of the required brands is an issue for restaurants that place orders on the excise department website. Restaurateur Jasjit Singh said his Japanese restaurant and bar Shibuya offered Japanese sake, gin and beers, but over the last few days, he has had very little or no availability of the brands mentioned on his menu. Dreading the situation over the next few days, Singh said, “A customer won’t know that we are facing a supply crunch and most drinks on our menu will not be available. They will think the place has cut corners and stopped stocking premium drinks. Such a situation is bad for business that runs on goodwill.” Goumtesh Singh of Raasta concurred with Singh and claimed that due to the prevailing uncertainty in the market, some outlets had preordered and stocked brands for the coming festive season. Others are having to struggle with availability, he said, and predicted a tough two months for the industry. He recalled restaurants offering just a single tequila or vodka option, one perhaps not even mentioned on the menu but being served as that was what the outlet managed to procure that day. Hoping that the situation wouldn’t last long just when bars had started seeing an uptick in business, Minakshi Singh of Sidecar said that while ‘high inventory’ spaces like hers always stocked up and being a cocktail bar they knew how to offer the right flavours, it would prove a difficult period for many smaller establishments. Minakshi Singh felt the new policy required new registration, which is easier for bigger brands, but might mean an extra burden for boutique brands selling craft liquor. Newly appointed president of National Restaurant Association of India, restaurateur Kabir Suri, confirmed that brand availability and volume of preferred liquor was at present a problem in the city. He said many brands were not available for bulk or retail purchases. He added that the restaurant body was hoping to meet the excise department on Friday to apprise them of the supply crunch.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/as-city-moves-to-new-regime-restaurants-fret-about-liquor-shortage-for-two-months/articleshow/86243411.cms||Amin Ali
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: BJP MLA uses foul language against minister, apologises||JAIPUR: The assembly adjourned for half an hour during Zero Hour while discussing law and order situation after a BJP legislator used abusive language against a minister. The discussion began on a noisy note when BJP MLA Madan Dilawar alleged that the Brij Bhoomi in Mewat (Bharatpur region) is being converted into land of terror by agents of some international Islamic extremist organisations. Dilawar alleged that the Brij area which was once the centre of Krishna Leelas has become a hell area today. The lands of Dalits are being occupied, temples are being demolished and mosques are being built. Mewat area has become a haven for terrorists. The NIA (National Investigation Agency) has also caught the terrorists from this area. Education minister Govind Singh Dotasra intervened to say the BJP had nothing constructive to do except playing Hindu-Muslim politics. Dilawar was followed by another BJP MLA Abhinesh Mehrishi who said the Congress government had even implicated an RSS leader which was objected to by Dotasra. Mehrishi was referring to RSS leader Nimabram who was named in the FIR by ACB in connection with the alleged demand of kick back for the release of outstanding dues of garbage collection company BVG from Jaipur Greater Municipal Corporation. This led to arguments by both the ruling and Opposition members. Dilwar then used some inappropriate language against Dotasra and following the ruckus, Rajendra Pareek who was in the chair adjourned the House for half an hour. Later, when the House resumed session, the chair asked Dilawar to apologise. Though Opposition leader Gulab Chand Kataria tendered an apology on behalf of Dilawar, the chair insisted on an apology by Dilawar and he obliged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bjp-mla-uses-foul-language-against-minister-apologises/articleshow/86245863.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Mainpuri girl death: Remain present in court today too, Allahabad high court tells DGP||PRAYAGRAJ: Taking serious note of the laxity in the investigation of the suspicious death of a 16-year-old girl student of Mainpuri, the Allahabad high court on Wednesday directed the director general of police (DGP), Uttar Pradesh (UP) to remain present before the court again on Thursday, saying, “We take such matters very seriously. Don’t think that she was a poor man’s daughter, she was the nation's daughter.” As per direction of the court, when the DGP along with the special investigation team (SIT) appeared before the court on Wednesday, he was directed to go through the records of the case and remain present again before the court on Thursday to clarify the action of the police authorities in conducting the investigation. The court further asked as to why disciplinary action against the then superintendent of police (SP), Mainpuri could not be completed before his retirement almost six months back. The Mainpuri girl was found hanging inside her school in suspicious circumstances on September 16, 2019. Her family members had alleged that she was sexually assaulted and killed. An FIR in this connection was lodged on the next day on September 17, 2019. Hearing a PIL filed by one Mahendra Pratap Singh, a division bench comprising Acting Chief Justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari and Justice Anil Kumar Ojha observed, “Despite the seriousness shown by the court to the case and the manner of the investigation coupled with direction against the defaulting police officer, no follow-up action has been taken, rather the matter is not being briefed to the DGP, UP to know the sensitivity of the case.” “In view of the above, we are left with no option but to keep this matter tomorrow, i.e., September 16, 2021 at 10:00 AM as the first case when DGP, UP and members of SIT would remain present in the court to clarify about the action of the police authorities in making the investigation,” the court added. In the PIL, the petitioner has alleged that police were not fairly investigating the incident and were rather protecting the actual accused. Also, even the SIT formed for investigating the case was not acting independently. “We hope that good sense prevails and appropriate action is taken against the erring officers who neither interrogated the matter properly nor collected the medical evidence and sent it to the forensic lab within time,” said the court. Earlier on Tuesday, the court, after going through the case record, had observed, “It is found that though the FIR of the incident dated September 16, 2019, was lodged on the next day having allegation and naming the accused but interrogation of the accused was not made immediately or within reasonable time, rather it was done after almost three months.” Hence, in this backdrop, the court had said that it seems that the SIT team investigating the matter was not acting independently and had accordingly directed the DGP of UP to remain present before the court on Wednesday.

These super-specialty students completed their studies from institutes on the Civil Hospital campus. They were expected to execute bonds that they would serve in rural areas of Gujarat after obtaining their degrees. If they failed to serve in rural areas, they would have to forfeit the Rs 50 lakh bond amount. These students claimed that these bonds were never executed and they were not supposed to be bound by such conditions. They have put forth various reasons for not being bound by such conditions. On the other hand, the authorities insisted that they should serve in rural areas for three years. Since the bond condition has not been fulfilled, the government have decided not to return certificates, marksheets and other personal documents to the students. For want of these documents and certificates, these students cannot undertake private medical practice. They have approached the high court through advocate Sharvil Majmudar and senior advocate Mihir Joshi appeared for them. They questioned the government’s decision to withhold their documents and demanded immediate release of the documents arguing that the government cannot keep the documents as under lien. Justice Bhargav Karia on Tuesday issued notice to the authorities seeking their reply by September 21. Meanwhile, the judge pulled up the authorities over a similar issue in another case, when a person sought release of documents, certificates and marksheets belonging to his son, who completed his MBBS at a GMERS college. The government withheld his documents saying that he should either pay Rs 2 lakh towards the bond or serve in rural areas for two years. The student was resisting the execution of the bond and completed his studies and is now bound for foreign shores. His father raised the grievance that if his son’s documents were not released, he would not be able to survive abroad because he would have problems getting employment. The judge asked the government under which rule it could withhold the student’s documents. “This is nothing but barbarism,” the judge commented. The government lawyer tried to defend the delay in executing the Rs 2 lakh bond because it adopted a sympathetic approach, but the court said the authorities cannot ruin a person’s career by withholding his documents, if they have shown sympathy initially. The judge was also critical of the student’s approach and criticised the government for showing sympathy to those who are not worthy of it, because they are not ready to serve in rural areas and are eager to run away from the country after their studies. The court also questioned the petitioner on his locus standi, to which he argued that he was the ultimate affected party because he has to bear the financial burden as his son cannot become independent. The petitioner finally joined his son as a petitioner and the court on Wednesday issued him notice, asking him to remain present in court on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/rural-service-govt-withholds-papers/articleshow/86243395.cms||---

Leader of Opposition Gulab Chand Kataria accused the state of deliberately listed the amendment in the assembly to divert the attention of people from the real issues. “For a minor change of revising the penalty, you have wasted the whole day. It is not only absurd, but it is not in line with the tradition of the assembly,” said Kataria who questioned minister transport Pratap Singh Khachariyawas to share how many people were fined travelling without ticket and how much money has been collected from them in the same period. “I would like to know how much money the transport department is expecting or projecting to generate under the new penalty? How would it help them in paying the debt of Rs 5,000 crore,” said Kataria. The BJP leader added that RSRTC is falling short of Rs 700 crore against its total expenditure of Rs 2,100 crore. Independent MLA Sanyam Lodha asked the government that revising the penalties is a minor change in the rules that could be done at the department level. The amendment revises the penalty from Rs 500 to Rs 2,000, along with the total fare. “It would have been great had the transport department discussed the challenges ahead of the RSRTC in the interest of people,” said Lodha. who advised the state to maintain the sanctity of the house by raising issues of public interest. Replying to the allegations by the state, Khachariyawas says that the move is to bring discipline to the state transport system and to curb the losses it has been incurring by non-ticket travellers. “There was no need for 10-12 MLAs to list their names for expressing their views on the simple amendment which they are blaming us for wasting their time,” said Khachariywas. During the debate, BJP leaders accused the minister of having his financial interest in the transport department contracts for which sparked heated arguments between the BJP leaders and the minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/oppn-terms-move-on-road-transport-act-waste-of-time/articleshow/86245832.cms||---
---||Allahabad||BJP to appoint 6K to 12K panna pramukhs for every assembly seat||Prayagraj: Gearing up for the 2022 assembly polls, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leadership has set the ball rolling and started appointing panna pramukhs (booth-level party workers) in every constituency of the Prayagraj district. At least 6,000 to 10,000 panna pramukhs will be appointed at every assembly constituency of the district. The Prayagraj district has a total of 12 assembly seats. Mritunjay Tiwari, BJP state working committee member, told TOI that “a panna pramukh is assigned to consolidate party’s support among voters and keeping in mind the fast-approaching state assembly election, a mega drive was underway to appoint panna pramukhs at every booth and assembly seat in the district.” He further said that one panna pramukh will be appointed for every 60 voters. The campaign to appoint panna pramukh started on September 11 and would be completed by September 20 not only in the district but across the state. There would be a panna pramukh sammelan at every assembly seat across the state on September 24, said Tiwari. As the state government will be completing four and a half years on September 19, a series of events will be organised and party workers would be reaching out to the masses to better communicate the achievements of the Yogi led state government. Senior BJP leader and state co-convener ( media) Ashish Gupta told TOI that the party has started appointing panna pramukhs given the fast approaching assembly elections, and for that purpose, a panna pramukh is a key functionary at the booth level. He further added that a panna pramukh plays a major role in polls and every panna pramukh was assigned to motivate at least 60 voters to cast their votes in polls. Gupta, meanwhile, said that the appointment of panna pramukhs and their subsequent conferences and activities will offer enough time for panna pramukhs to reach out to voters before the state assembly elections next year. “The appointment of panna pramukhs was being done under the party’s planning and management wing. Most of the panna pramukhs will be appointed by September 20,” a senior party functionary said. He further emphasised that a panna pramukh is an important representative of the party at the booth level. When the Election Commission (EC) releases a voter list for every booth which has names and addresses of all voters, a panna pramukh acts as the in-charge of one page (both front and back) of a voter list. His role is to reach out to the voters mentioned on that page, build communication with them, help them get the benefits of the government’s welfare schemes if they fulfil the criteria, and look into the problems faced by them. The maximum that a booth can have is a committee of 21 members. Every booth has a president, a general secretary, two vice-presidents and two secretaries, besides other office-bearers and members. A booth committee is formed based on social and caste scenarios and booth members are made panna pramukhs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/bjp-to-appoint-6k-to-12k-panna-pramukhs-for-every-assembly-seat/articleshow/86245850.cms||---

Vector borne ailments especially dengue has increased in the last two months across the state. The CM urged people to take precautionary measures and collectively eradicate larvae breeding. “Dengue cases have been reported in some districts. We can control it by taking precautionary measures. We need to collectively participate in this campaign,” he said as he reminded people also about getting vaccinated for protection against Covid-19. According to estimates, there have been five deaths attributed to dengue in Madhya Pradesh this season. Till July, there were 291 cases of dengue in MP in 2021, according to National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP). In August and September, another 2,200 dengue cases were reported. In comparison, 809 dengue cases were reported in 2020 with zero deaths. In 2019, MP had reported 4,189 dengue cases and two deaths, going by NVBDSP data. The spurt in malaria, dengue, chikungunya cases has stretched the urban development & health department resources away from Covid vaccination. While launching the drive, the CM fumigated a locality and put Gambusia fish which eat larvae of the mosquito in a pond near the programme site in Nehru Nagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/shivraj-launches-drive-to-check-dengue-spread/articleshow/86240905.cms||---

The fire and emergency services department took the step after repeated reminders sent to these establishments were ignored, said officials.  “The department had reminded them to renew their fire safety permissions and also issued a number of notices to the managements but they did not pay any heed. Finally, we issued closure notices and sealed 13 such restaurants and hotels on Wednesday,” Rajesh Bhatt, additional chief fire officer, said. Most of these establishments are located in areas falling under AMC’s south west zone. “Six restaurants and hotels are located in Satellite, Prahladnagar, Manekbaug and SG Highway which falls under south west zone, while five of them are located in Navrangpura, Chandkheda, and Koba highway areas that fall under west zone,” the official said. On September 3, the fire department had slapped final notices on nine hospitals whose fire safety NOCs had expired on August 31. It had warned the managements of punitive action if they did not renew their fire permits within a week. Eight patients had lost their lives when a major fire broke out at Shrey Hospital in Navrangpura on August 6 last year. “We will continue to carry out stringent action against any commercial establishment that does not comply with fire safety rules. These are places where people gather in large numbers. They cannot play with people’s lives,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/13-restaurants-hotels-sealed-for-not-renewing-fire-nocs/articleshow/86243422.cms||---
---||India||Gujarat cabinet swearing-in delayed, to be held today||GANDHINAGAR: The swearing-in of new Gujarat CM Bhupendra Patel's council of ministers was put off by a day amid high drama in the state capital on Wednesday over the BJP high command's purported diktat to replace all 23 members of the erstwhile Vijay Rupani cabinet with younger faces. As the state BJP think tank walked the political razor's edge in trying to compile a list adhering to the "no-repeat" formula, discontent mounted among ministers over being asked to make way in what looks to be an unprecedented churn. Several ministers were said to be particularly upset about being informed over the phone that they wouldn't be retained. Senior party functionaries said the outgoing ministers would surely be placated before a fresh cabinet takes guard on Thursday. While most ministers vacated their offices in a hurry on Tuesday, a poster mentioning that the swearing-in ceremony was scheduled for Wednesday was hurriedly pulled down at Raj Bhavan. The governor's office later announced that the swearing-in would be held at 1.30pm on Thursday. The CMO confirmed the rescheduled event through a tweet. Senior ministers had been working their phones ever since the surprise selection of first-time MLA Patel as the state's 17th CM. After the swearing-in of a new council of ministers was first postponed by a couple of hours before being rescheduled for Thursday, the residences of state BJP president C R Paatil and former CM Rupani witnessed a hubbub through the day as ministers and contenders for berths flitted in and out. Rupani's erstwhile cabinet colleagues, including four Congress turncoats, are learnt to have voiced dissent at being dropped unceremoniously. Kunvarji Bavaliya, Jawahar Chavda, Dharmendrasinh Jadeja and Jayesh Radadiya had quit Congress recently and joined BJP after being offered ministerial berths. Akhil Bharatiya Koli Samaj dashed off a letter to PM Narendra Modi, saying that dropping Bavaliya, its national chairman, would send a wrong message to the community and turn them against BJP in various constituencies in Gujarat and elsewhere in the country. The no-repeat experiment has upset caste equations, more so in cases where no immediate replacements are available for ministers from specific communities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/gujarat-cabinet-swearing-in-delayed-to-be-held-today/articleshow/86249075.cms||---

---||Nagpur||22 duped of Rs1.5 crore on pretext of ZP jobs||CHANDRAPUR: In a job scam that runs into Rs1.5 crore, a trickster duped 22 youngsters by promising employment in Chandrapur Zilla Parishad (ZP). The ZP officials on Wednesday lodged an FIR with Ramnagar police station in this connection. PSO, Ramnagar, Manohar Gite said no arrest has been made yet. The investigation is likely to reveal more victims. As per the complaint, one Brijeshkumar Jha issued bogus appointment letters with forged signature of collector and a former CEO to 22 people after taking around Rs7 lakh from each of them. The matter came to light after two youngsters, Surajnath Kodape and Nitin Ghorpade, approached CEO Mitali Sethi with the appointment letters which were not issued by the ZP administration. It turned out that the signatures of collector and a former CEO were forged with help of computerized scan of original signatures. Kodape, who had earlier worked for ZP on temporary basis, was seeking reappointment. Ghorpade was looking for a job of junior clerk for his brother Rupesh. Jha, a resident of Ballarpur, had issued the bogus appointment letters in 2019-20 but stopped the aspirants from joining ZP by giving different reasons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/22-duped-of-rs1-5cr-on-pretext-of-zp-jobs/articleshow/86243434.cms||Mazhar Ali
---||Delhi||Spreading the web: Book adaptations on OTT platform give wider reach to written words||Mumbai: A discussion on adaptation of books for the screen, especially the web series on the OTT platform, at the Times Litfest turned out to be interesting and intellectually stimulating. Moderated by Samina Shaikh, the session saw award-winning author Manju Kapur, producer-director Ekta Kapoor, television actor Ridhi Dogra and writer-director Piyush Jha sharing their views on how films made on books enhance the reach of the written words. The discussion also touched upon the revocation of Article 377 and the way society looks at people in same-sex relationships. When Shaikh asked Kapur how she saw Ekta Kapoor’s The Married Woman, based on Kapur’s book A Married Woman, she said the book would not have reached so many people. “If she had not made a series on it, I don’t think it would have reached so many people. Many people read the book after watching the series,” said Kapur, who taught English literature for three decades at Delhi University’s Miranda House. Dogra, who played Astha in The Married Woman, said the character had appealed a lot to her. “Astha is a married woman and wants to be loved. I enjoyed playing this character,” she said. Kapoor maintained that the book had far more than what her show could present. Speaking on same-sex relationships, Jha said people formed opinion about others without knowing them. He also said adaptation of books for the web was going to keep people riveted as the medium had an appeal. Kapur said she didn’t interfere with the producers adapting her books for films as “my imagination is not visual”. “I was a teacher for 30 years and filmmaking is a different world,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/spreading-the-web-book-adaptations-on-ott-platform-give-wider-reach-to-written-words/articleshow/86243488.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala’s caravan tourism policy unveiled||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state has announced a comprehensive, stakeholder-friendly caravan tourism policy that promises the tourists a safe, customized and closest-to-nature travel experience. “This marks a paradigm shift almost three decades after the state made it big with houseboat tourism that provided a unique experience to visitors and positioned the state as a major global destination,” said tourism minister P A Mohamed Riyas, while unveiling the policy which offers attractive investment subsidies to caravan operators. He said that like other successful tourism products of the state launched since the 1990s, caravan tourism is also expected to be developed in public-private partnership (PPP) mode with private investors, tour operators and local communities being key stakeholders, he said. Investment subsidies would be given to caravan operators, the details of which would be announced soon, he added. Two major components of the new concept include touring caravans and caravan parks. While the first involves specially-built vehicles for travel, leisure and stay, caravan parks are designated places to park the vehicles and enable the visitors to spend a night or a day or station for an extended period to explore the destination. Caravan tourism is expected to promote responsible tourism activities for sustainable growth and for the benefit of local communities, promote eco-friendly practices and market for local products. “Going by the state’s inherent strengths of natural beauty and tourism-friendly culture, caravan tourism has immense scope for the state. Besides offering a refreshing experience for tourists, local communities stand to gain substantially by enabling them to showcase their culture and products before the visitors,” said tourism director V R Krishna Teja. There will be two types of caravans. In one model, two guests shall be accommodated, while the other is for a family of four members. The tourism caravans will have all the necessary facilities for a comfortable stay such as sofa-cum-bed, kitchenette with fridge and microwave oven, dining table, toilet cubicle, partition behind the driver, air-conditioner, internet connectivity, audio-video facilities, charging system and GPS. Eco-friendliness being a major feature of caravan tourism, preferably Bharat Stage VI-compliant vehicles will be pressed into service. Assuring complete security of the guests, there will be IT-enabled real-time monitoring of caravans. A fool-proof approval mechanism is also put in place for approval for the operation of caravans based on the procedures set by the motor vehicles department. The caravan parks are to be developed in the private sector, public sector or in the joint sector. The configuration of parks will vary from location to location. A caravan park will be a completely safe and secure zone offering a hassle-free and stress-free environment to tourists, protected with necessary features like compound wall, adequate security and safety arrangements, patrolling and surveillance cameras. The park authorities will coordinate with local authorities and medical establishments in case of medical emergencies. A minimum 50 cents land is required for a park with at least five parking bays. The park design should be compatible with its surroundings, causing the least possible disturbance to the site. Landscaping and plantation have to be planned to ensure privacy, green cover, and take into account factors such as wind, dust and noise. The parks in hilly and ecologically-fragile areas will have to incorporate creative architecture in conformity with local heritage. The parks should have proper water harvesting structures and there should be a strategically located open space for recreation, a forecourt, drive-in area and turning circles. The parks will also have tourist facilitation centres to inform the visitors of amenities and services available.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/states-caravan-tourism-policy-unveiled/articleshow/86243464.cms||---

---||Allahabad||Civil Enclave of Prayagraj has catered to 10 lakh passengers in less than 3 years||Prayagraj: In less than three years of becoming operational, the Civil Enclave (Prayagraj airport) located in Bamrauli area of Sangam city has achieved the distinction of catering to over ten lakh air passengers. The Civil Enclave at Prayagraj becomes the third airport of the state, after Lucknow and Varanasi, to achieve this milestone. This Civil Enclave was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on December 16, 2018 before the Kumbh Mela. However, the new terminal was opened for passengers only on January 1, 2019. From that day till September 13 this year, the airport has seen the influx of 10,05,955 passengers. During this period, more than 12,000 flights operated from the airport. This also includes private chartered planes along with major air service providers. Had it not been for the first and second waves of Covid-19, which resulted in a sudden shortfall of passengers arriving or leaving the city, the feat of crossing ten lakh passengers could have been achieved by the airport in January itself. During the first wave of the pandemic, flight operations were badly affected at the airport because of the lockdown (from March 25 to May 24 2020). Likewise, flight operations were again adversely affected during the second Covid wave which led to fewer flights in May and June this year. However, after fighting all odds, the airport achieved a significant milestone on September 8 when the number of air passengers crossed the ten lakh mark. By August 31, the number of passengers travelling through the airport had reached 9.91 lakh. On September 7, the number of passengers reached 9,99407. After this, on September 8, this figure crossed the ten lakh mark as 956 more passengers arrived at or departed from the airport. Till September 13, the total passenger movement at Prayagraj airport went up to 10.05 lakh. A total of 11 flights are currently runnimg from Prayagraj airport to ten cities. Flight to Delhi and Bilaspur is being operated by Air India’s Alliance Air. Direct flights by private airline Indigo are being operated for Bangalore, Pune, Raipur, Gorakhpur, Delhi, Mumbai, Dehradun, Bhopal and Bhubaneshwar. “It was the dream of our PM that every common man can afford air travel, and the state government is in the process of fulfilling this dream. Till the year 2017, only 25 flights were operating from four airports in the state, but now 73 flights are being operated regularly from eight airports including Prayagraj. Soon Jewar, Ayodhya, Chitrakoot, Aligarh, Moradabad airports will also be included in the air service map,” said minister of civil aviation in the state cabinet, Nand Gopal Gupta Nandi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/civil-enclave-of-prayagraj-has-catered-to-10-lakh-passengers-in-less-than-3-years/articleshow/86245871.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan to amend law that restricts transportation of camels||JAIPUR: Agriculture minister Lal Chand Kataria said the government plans to amend the Rajasthan Camel (Prohibition of Slaughter & Regulation of Temporary Migration or Export) Act, 2015 that put restrictions on transportation of the animal both inside and outside the state. Camel was declared a state animal under this Act. The state’s camel population had witnessed drastic reduction in recent years following the passing of the Act as buying and selling of the animal had become a cumbersome process. He said mechanisation and better transportation facilites in rural areas also reduced dependence on camels. The minister said the government would consider the proposal of setting up Camel- shalas on the lines of Gaushalas for unwanted camels. The minister was replying to a call attention motion by deputy leader of opposition Rajendra Rathore on the dwindling camel population in the state. Rathore said camel count had witnessed a drastic decline in recent years. He said if preservation measures were not taken, camels would be seen only in zoos by the end of this century. Rajasthan accounts for 84 % of camel population. As per the Livestock census between 1951 and 1992, the number of camels in Rajasthan continued to increase, bar a small decline in 1988. The first major decline was registered between 1992 and 1997, when the number of camels declined from 7.46 lakh to 6.69 lakh; the highest-ever camel population in the state was 7.56 lakh in the year 1983. However, the current figure of 2.13 lakh camels in the state is lower than 3.41 lakh camels in the year 1951. Rathore said after the Act of 2015, police could act against illegal transportation of camels but it seldom acted as it had no provision to take care of the animal or no organisation came forward to look after them. He suggested setting up camel-shalas on the lines of gaushalas. The minister said he would consider the suggestion of camel shalas and come out with a policy soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-to-amend-law-that-restricts-transportation-of-camels/articleshow/86245883.cms||Joychen Joseph

However, it is pertinent to note that, 46% of the overall IPC cases registered in 2020 happened to be related to Covid-19 violations which mainly include 188 IPC (disobeying orders duly promulgated by a government servant). Subtracting the Covid-19 violations, AP’s overall crime rate sees a 15% decline compared to that of 2019. Special and Local Laws (SLL) is another area in which there has been a huge spike of 85% in the registration of cases in the state last year. This is primarily due to the launch of the Special Enforcement Bureau (SEB), which conducted massive drives against liquor smuggling and drugs. Cases booked under Andhra Pradesh Prohibition Act, AP Excise Act and Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act increased by 332%, 204% and 21% respectively. Other major crime heads such as murders and crimes against women saw a marginal decline of 2% and 4% respectively. In terms of increasing crimes, crimes against children saw a slight increase of four percent in 2020. The majority of crimes against children include kidnapping and sexual offences. While lockdown helped increase the number of cases booked, the same period helped in a significant decrease in crimes such as kidnapping, robbery, theft and even road accidents by over 10% in 2020 compared to 2019. Overall, violent crimes dropped by 12%. The state saw a slight decrease in crime against women in 2020 with 17,089 cases reported. In 2019, a total of 17,746 cases of crime against women were reported. As many as 1,192 people including 587 minor girls were raped in 2020. On the downside, the overall case pendency percentage stands at 54% giving the state the 7th rank in the country. In 2019, the overall pendency of cases stood at 41%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/at-46-of-all-offences-covid-violations-pull-up-crime-rate/articleshow/86253466.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

---||Lucknow||SP neta: Casteist BJP responsible for joblessness in state||Lucknow: SP leader and Mahmoodabad MLA Narendra Verma on Wednesday strongly rebuffed allegations about his party treading casteist lines for political gains. Verma said that if SP followed casteism, he would not have been the party’s chief whip in UP Assembly. Verma is the lone Kurmi MLA of SP. “Casteism is being followed by the ruling BJP. There have been discussions about BJP making a government of Thakur community,” Verma said while speaking at the session on ‘Jaati Jaati Kab Tak...Vikas Vikas Kyun Nahi’ at the Navbharat Navnirman Manch - Uttar Pradesh organised by Times Now Navbharat. He squarely accused the BJP of being responsible for joblessness of youth and policies which are anti-farmer and anti-poor. “They showed people this...,” Verma said, waving the ‘Sankalp Patra’ of the BJP in 2017. “They claimed to double farmers’ income. But what happened? Prices which the farmers received for their crops remained low, cane prices increased by only Rs 10 in the past four years,” he said. Verma also slammed BJP for being responsible for the incident in Lakhimpur where a women SP worker was manhandled. “Janta jawab degi..2022 bahut door nahi ab…,” he said. Responding to a question about BSP organising Brahmin meets, BSP’s national spokesperson Sudhindra Bhadoria said that his party always stood for ‘samtamoolak samaj’ as envisaged by BR Ambedkar. “Our party leaders including Kanshi Ram and Mayawati ji have championed the cause and formed the government,” he said, stressing that during the BSP regime, people of all sections of society received honour. Bhadoria also raked up the incident of Hathras in which a Dalit minor was raped and burnt alive. He said that BJP would have reacted strongly if the girl hailed from a forward caste. BJP national spokesperson Shazia Ilmi objected to Bhadoria’s comment saying that her party never differentiated between castes. “Rape of any woman is a national shame for every one of us,” she said, arguing that the Opposition would remain silent if similar incidents occurred in West Bengal. On the issue of caste census, Ilmi said that the Centre was ready to help the state government in conducting such a census. Ilmi also hit out at SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, taunting that the former CM was seeing ‘Mungeri Lal ke haseen sapne’ by claiming that he would return to power with an overwhelming majority in UP. “The number of medical colleges constructed during the four-year rule of BJP is way more than in SP’s regime. The number of government jobs given to the youth is more than double of that in SP regime. That’s development, there is no room for casteism,” she said. She accused Akhilesh of lying about the Yogi Adityanath government evicting the poor from houses for Ram temple. “The entire land acquisition was done under due legal framework,” she stressed. To this, Verma alleged that largescale corruption was done in purchasing land for the temple. “Even in Gorakhpur, as many as 75 families living in close proximity to Gorakhnath temple were evicted,” he charged. On the issue of cane prices, SP and BSP leaders charged BJP with cheating farmers by not raising the state advisory price adequately. Ilmi, however, countered that the BJP government ensured timely and adequate payment for farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sp-neta-casteist-bjp-responsible-for-joblessness-in-state/articleshow/86247382.cms||Pankaj Shah

Now, the apex court will decide the matter once the state government presents its side,” Dikshit further informed TOI. Dikshit further said, “On Wednesday, a two-member bench of Justice Abdul Nazeer and Justice Krishna Murari admitted the special leave petition (SLP) in this regard and agreed to hear the bail plea after listening to Tankha.” The police had made Amar’s minor widow an accused in the Bikru case. She was booked under serious sections of the IPC and sent to jail. The Juvenile Justice Board had declared her a minor. Since then, she has been kept in Barabanki’s Child Protection Home. Her lawyer had filed a bail petition in the High Court. After hearing the arguments of both the sides, the High Court had rejected her bail plea. Subsequently, her lawyer had approached the Supreme Court. To recall, the minor was married to Amar on June 29, 2020. On the night of July 2, 2020, just three days after the wedding, a police team reached the gangster’s house in Bikru regarding action against him and his aides in connection with an attempt to murder case. During the raid, eight policemen were ambushed by Dubey and his aides. Along with Vikas, Amar Dubey too had absconded after the ambush. On July 8, Amar, who was carrying a reward of Rs 50,000, was killed in an encounter by the STF in Maudaha, Hamirpur. On July 9, two more alleged Vikas aides — Kartikeya alias Prabhat and Praveen alias Bauwa Dubey — were killed in separate encounters in Kanpur and Etawah districts. Vikas was killed in an encounter with the police on the morning of July 10 when a police vehicle carrying him from Ujjain to Kanpur met with an accident and he tried to escape from the spot in Bhauti area of Kanpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/sc-agrees-to-hear-bail-plea-of-amar-dubeys-minor-widow-in-bikru-case/articleshow/86245932.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

The initial probe revealed that the immersion procession had left from Deodar Street around 10.30pm, barely half an hour before the night restrictions. The organizers had not taken any permission either from local police or traffic police in this regard. “The lapse was on the part of local police. An enquiry is being conducted and an action will be taken,” said a senior officer of the detective department, adding all immersions had to be completed by 11pm. Cops said that despite the inclement weather, they had been instructed to step up checking from Tuesday night. On both Tuesday and Wednesday nights, naka checks were conducted across the city as cops were found patrolling on roads — from Thakurpukur to Sinthee — with umbrellas and checking each vehicle. Local cops at Gorky Sadan will be asked whether they had any information about the main thoroughfare being blocked by a procession. “Though traffic police have been carrying out checks each night since May, the presence of local cops at the checkpoints has gone up too.

It would take days for the situation to normalize as people are still struggling to come to terms with heavy losses of household valuables. Sludge has filled up houses and restoring electricity is being undertaken on a war footing. State-run Paschim Gujarat Vij Company Ltd (PGVCL) claimed power was restored by Wednesday in all 82 villages of Rajkot and 60 out of 84 affected villages in Jamnagar district DB Vyas, managing director, PGVCL told TOI: “There are hardly 8-10 villages in Jamnagar where electricity has been restored as they are still unapproachable. Due to high water levels, there is a fear of short circuits. We could restore electricity in two days in most of the affected villages.” According to Vyas, PGVCL has suffered damages worth Rs 15 crore in Rajkot alone while that in Jamnagar district is yet to be calculated. The discom erected 488 electricity poles in two days in Jamnagar. The internal roads that connect villages are badly damaged and several small causeways are broken which has restricted the movement of administration as well as locals. The work to clear the roads has also resumed in both the districts. According to villagers, the major problem is stinking carcasses of animals and filth that need to be cleared as soon as possible. According to a rough estimate, over 300 animals died in the badly affected villages of Jamnagar including Aliyabada, Dhuvav, Khijadiya, Vagadiya, Koza, Moda, Banga, Navagam and Dudhala. The kutcha houses in the villages are completely damaged and household items have been washed away in the pucca ones. A bus carrying sweepers from Rajkot reached Jamnagar to supplement the cleaning efforts. In Jamnagar city, municipal commissioner Vijay Kharadi ordered a continuous cleanliness drive during the night also. Senior officers of Jamnagar Municipal Corporation (JMC) inspected the cleanliness work on Tuesday night too. Close to 157 roads remain blocked due to inundation, affecting traffic movement. These included a national highway in Jamnagar district, 17 state highways in Rajkot, Jamnagar, Junagadh, Bhavnagar, Amreli and Surat districts and 127 panchayat roads connecting villages, they said. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted heavy to very heavy rainfall at isolated places in the state till Saturday morning. The state transport corporation said due to the closure of 165 routes on which it operates daily buses, it will not be able to conduct 522 trips, majority of them being in Jamnagar, Junagadh and Rajkot districts, which are among the worst affected due to the heavy downpour on Sunday and Monday. According to officials, 48 villages in Rajkot, Jamnagar and Porbandar were likely to be affected due to the outflow of a large amount of water into the rivers from three major dams in those districts||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/respite-from-downpour-but-miseries-far-from-over/articleshow/86241123.cms||---

A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and justice Jyoti Singh in the process disposed of the plea that also alleged illegal construction and mushrooming of encroachments in the vicinity of the monument and urged the high court to direct demolition action. However, the bench pointed out that no blanket orders could be passed without hearing the other parties, which may be affected. The court has to hear them, and they have not been made a party to the plea, the high court pointed out, while asking ASI to examine if there are any encroachments and remove them as per law. The court also specified that the authorities will grant the alleged encroachers a hearing before taking any action. The plea said that Lal Gumbad, a Tughlaq-era structure in the neighbourhood of south Delhi’s Panchsheel Park is being encroached upon. Earlier, speaking to TOI, the local RWA president Sudhir Gupta had claimed, “Our colony shares a common wall with the plot on which Lal Gumbad and its cluster monuments stand. We are very concerned that the integrity of the historical structure is being compromised, because the ground is being flattened after a fence was put up around it. Trees are also being chopped down and clearly construction work has begun in violation of laws.” While Gupta added that a JJ colony had sprung up in the area adjoining Lal Gumbad, Sunil Jain, co-owner of the land, had rebutted all charges of encroachment. He had said, “The land has belonged to our family for several decades and we only cleaned up the rubble and the garbage there.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-asks-asi-to-inspect-remove-encroachments-around-lal-gumbad/articleshow/86243525.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kochi||Infidelity: Kerala high court allows DNA test of child||KOCHI: The Kerala high court has allowed the plea of a man certified as infertile to conduct DNA test of child to prove wife’s infidelity. The decision by a division bench comprising Justice A Muhamed Mustaque and Justice Kauser Edappagath came after considering a petition filed by a man from Thiruvananthapuram who is serving in the Army. Seeking divorce on the ground of infidelity, he had alleged that his wife has been living an adulterous life with her sister’s husband and that it was his child. The marriage between the petitioner and his wife was on May 7, 2006 and the child was born on March 9, 2007. He had gone to Lakadh for work after 22 days and there was no physical relationship with his wife during those 22 days or thereafter, he had alleged while seeking a DNA test to prove his wife’s infidelity. To decide the case, the high court relied on the Supreme Court’s rulings of 2014 (Nandlal Wasudeo Badwaik vs Lata Nandlal Badwaik and Another) and 2015 (Dipanwita Roy vs Ronobroto Roy). In these cases, the apex court had held that DNA test is scientifically accurate and can be permitted to establish infidelity if a strong prima facie case is made out, the high court said. While allowing the plea, the high court pointed out that the man had produced an infertility certificate issued by a doctor of Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram. “DNA testing is the most authentic and scientifically proved means to establish the paternity and thereby prove the case of infidelity and adultery set up by the petitioner,” the high court said while holding that a strong prima facie case has been made out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/infidelity-hc-allows-dna-test-of-child/articleshow/86243513.cms||---

---||Delhi||DDMA Allows Biz Exhibitions, No Physical Classes Up To VIII||New Delhi: With the novel coronavirus pandemic situation staying under control, Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) has permitted business-to-customer exhibitions in the capital after 18 months, but schools for classes up to VIII will continue to remain closed. DDMA has also not permitted social or religious gatherings, which has disappointed the Ramlila committees in the capital. The organisers have been demanding that they be permitted to hold the annual event. The DDMA order will stay effective from Thursday till September-end.Business-to-customer exhibitions had been banned since the first lockdown announced in March last year in the wake of the Covid-19 surge. Business-to-business exhibitions were allowed after the improvement in the situation.“Business-to-business and business-to-customer exhibitions will be allowed. The organisers will be responsible for strict adherence to the prescribed SOP issued by the commerce & industry ministry and all other instructions/guidelines issued by the central or Delhi governments from time to time,” the Wednesday order stated. Compliance of all Covid-appropriate behaviours like wearing of masks, maintaining social distancing, and regular hand washing and use of sanitiser will be compulsory to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, it added. Traders have been demanding permission for all exhibitions since the improvement in the Covid situation and opening of various economic activities, including weekly markets. “It has come as a big relief for hundreds of traders engaged in business-to-customer exhibition activities and thousands of people directly or indirectly associated with them. About 40,000 people are estimated to be associated with the industry in Delhi and have been waiting for a long time,” said Brijesh Goyal, chairman of Chamber of Trade & Industry. A group of traders recently called upon health and industry minister Satyendar Jain and senior DDMA officials with requests to permit such events. “Many exhibitions, which moved to Noida, Gurgaon and Ghaziabad due to the restrictions, will now be held in Delhi. It will also help Delhi government earn revenues,” Goyal said.DDMA has directed all district magistrates and deputy commissioners of police to strictly enforce Covid protocols in all public places so that festive gatherings don’t lead to the spread of Covid. The gatherings in markets are increasing as festival seasons have begun. The district administrations have already deployed enforcement teams in public places to issue challans for such violations.It has been observed during the review of the status of Covid-19 in Delhi that though the overall number of Covid patients and the positivity rate have declined considerably, caution and care have to be continued and any activity that can lead to a surge can be allowed only after a rigorous check and due diligence, DDMA stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ddma-allows-biz-exhibitions-no-physical-classes-up-to-viii/articleshow/86243520.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Delhi govt imposes full ban on sale, use & storage of crackers||NEW DELHI: Delhi government on Wednesday imposed a complete ban on storage, sale and use of all types of firecrackers with immediate effect in the capital. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said the decision was taken after reviewing the pollution levels around Diwali for the past three years. He appealed to traders not to stock crackers this year. Kejriwal tweeted, “In view of the dangerous condition of pollution in Delhi during the Diwali period for the past three years, like last year, a complete ban is being imposed on the storage, sale and use of all types of firecrackers, so that people’s lives can be saved.” पिछले 3 साल से दीवाली के समय दिल्ली के प्रदूषण की खतरनाक स्तिथि को देखते हुए पिछले साल की तरह इस बार भी हर प्रकार… https://t.co/XKqaLqV5uV— Arvind Kejriwal (@ArvindKejriwal) 1631688694000TimesViewThis is a small but important step to control pollution in the capital. However, Delhi government must continue with its efforts to ensure that the city doesn't get choked again by toxic air caused by the far bigger culprit, stubble burning.In another tweet, the CM said the ban was imposed early this year to avoid losses to traders. “Last year, a complete ban on firecrackers was imposed late after assessing the seriousness of the situation. This caused losses to the traders. It is an appeal to all traders that this time in view of the complete ban, please do not do any kind of stockage,” tweeted Kejriwal. पिछले साल व्यापारियों द्वारा पटाखों के भंडारण के पश्चात प्रदूषण की गंभीरता को देखत हुए देर से पूर्ण प्रतिबंध लगाया… https://t.co/yqp5jIhHcW— Arvind Kejriwal (@ArvindKejriwal) 1631688695000Environment minister Gopal Rai said NGT had directed for a complete ban on firecrackers during the pandemic when the air quality fell under the “poor” category and beyond. “Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data for the last three years shows Delhi is almost in the poor pollution index. Rajasthan, Odisha, Sikkim, West Bengal, Chandigarh and 13 districts of Uttar Pradesh had imposed a complete ban on firecrackers last year,” he added. Last year, Delhi government decided in favour of the complete ban on November 6, which was just before Diwali, but by then Delhi Police had already issued temporary licences for sale to traders. “Due to this, traders and dealers suffered losses. There were also incidents of bursting of firecrackers by residents due to easy availability. To avoid such a situation, we decided that Delhi Pollution Control Committee, like last year, will issue directions for complete ban on sale, use and storage of all types of firecrackers with immediate effect,” said Rai. A government official said the ban on firecrackers is for the entire season. In November last year, NGT had also imposed a ban on the sale and use of firecrackers in the NCR. However, firecracker traders have expressed unhappiness over Delhi government’s decision, which includes a ban on green crackers. Narendra Gupta, president, Fireworks Association, said, “Almost all companies manufacture green crackers, so why has the government banned it? People purchase crackers from the NCR and burst them in Delhi.” A CPCB report on “ambient air quality during Deepawali 2020” stated that Delhi saw the highest PM2.5 spike (82.9%) in the country on Diwali day compared with a day earlier.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-imposes-full-ban-on-sale-use-storage-of-crackers/articleshow/86243534.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Punjab tops crime rate in NDPS Act cases, Himachal Pradesh takes second spot||CHANDIGARH: Punjab continued to top the country in 2020 with a 22.9% crime rate (per lakh population) in cases registered under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985.

In absolute numbers, Uttar Pradesh is ahead of Punjab with a total of 10,852 registered cases last year under the NDPS Act but its crime rate is 4.7%. Based on the 2011 Census survey, Punjab’s projected population in mid-2020 was 3.01 crore. Punjab was also at the top of the chart in 2019 but its crime rate per lakh population under the NDPS Act was 38.5% as a total of 11,536 cases were registered. Himachal Pradesh, on the other hand, has climbed to the second spot in the country with 20.9% cases registered (per lakh population) under the NDPS Act last year. Out of the total 1,538 cases recorded under the NDPS Act in Himachal last year, 1,148 were for possession of drugs for trafficking and 390 for the possession of drugs for personal consumption. Himachal’s projected population was 73.62 lakh in mid-2020. The hill state was at the third spot in the country in 2019 with a crime rate of 19.7% per lakh population, with a total of 1,439 registered NDPS Act cases. Kerala trails Himachal in third place with 14 cases per lakh population registered under NDPS Act. Out of the total 4,968 cases, as many as 4,582 were registered for the possession of drugs for personal consumption and 386 for possession of drugs for trafficking. Kerala’s projected population was 3.53 crore in mid-2020. Kerala was in second place in 2019 with a crime rate of 26.3% per lakh population under the NDPS Act with a total of 9,245 cases. Overall, the country recorded 4.4 cases per lakh population under the NDPS Act in 2020 totalling 59,806. The country’s projected population in mid-2020 was 135.3 crore. Poor conviction in offences against the state Not even a single person was convicted in Punjab last year in cases regarding offences against the state and four accused were acquitted by the courts. Punjab registered as many as 70 cases last year for offences against the state out of which 19 were under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), three for waging war against the state, four under the Official Secrets Act, and 42 under The Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act. Punjab police had arrested 108 persons for offences against the state and 74 were charge-sheeted. At the end of 2020, as many as 122 cases were pending trial in various courts and the pendency percentage was 97 in Punjab. Corruption Cases In 2020, Punjab recorded a 22% conviction rate in cases under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, which is one of the poorest in the country. Among 28 states, Punjab figures at the fifth place from the bottom. Out of the total 27 cases of corruption in which the trial was completed in 2020, the accused were acquitted by courts in 21 cases. As many as 250 persons were arrested last year in corruption cases, of which 209 were charge-sheeted in courts. Other Cases The total number of registered cases in Punjab has increased from 70,318 in 2018 to 72,855 in 2019 and 82,875 in 2020 for crimes committed under the Indian Penal Code and various special and local laws. The charge-sheeting rate in these cases remained at 82 in Punjab in 2020. A total of 2,676 cases were recorded for deaths due to negligence related to road accidents in Punjab and in these 2,911 persons were the victims. A total of 882 persons lost their lives in murder cases in the state last year and 63 dowry deaths were recorded in the state besides 502 cases of rape. Punjab recorded a 25.1% conviction rate in cases pertaining to crime against women and 33.7% in cases of crime against children last year. Punjab registered a total of 720 cases under The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012 last year. The number of cyber-crime cases in Punjab increased from 239 in 2018 to 243 in 2019 and 378 in 2020 even during the Covid-19 induced lockdown when many other crimes witnessed a downward slide. Punjab has a 16% conviction rate in cyber-crime cases. A total of 119 cases were registered in Punjab last year under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act read with the Indian Penal Code for crimes against the Scheduled Castes. Of these, 46 cases were purely under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, which had 47 victims. Punjab has an 88.6 lakh population of Scheduled Castes as per the 2011 census. NCRB’s word of caution The primary presumption that the upward swing in police data indicates an increase in crime and is thus a reflection of the ineffectiveness of the police is fallacious, said NCRB. ‘Rise in crime’ and ‘increase in registration of crime by police’ are clearly two different things, a fact which is often confused. Thus an oft-repeated expectation from certain quarters that an effective police administration will be able to keep the crime figures low is misplaced.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ncrb-report-2020punjab-tops-crime-rate-in-ndps-act-cases-himachal-climbs-to-2nd-spot/articleshow/86245971.cms||Sanjeev Verma
---||Kolkata||She kept asking me to stay calm, recounts son||Kolkata: Sitting on a waterlogged road during heavy rain, with a leg stuck in a drain cover, the 65-year-old Jayashree Roy Chowdhury — who was rescued in New Town on Tuesday — had still not panicked. She kept speaking to her son Anit on phone even as he rushed back from his office. She was sipping on a cup of tea and “asked me to stay calm,” Anit recounted. She was finally rescued after more than three hours. “She is a very strong woman. I have been seeing her like this since my childhood. We lost our father at a very early age and since then, she has raised four of us alone. She hardly panics under any situation,” Anit told TOI on Wednesday. Two dozen fire brigade officers, 20-odd policemen, scores of civic personnel and some 50-odd locals had lent a helping hand to rescue the woman on Tuesday afternoon after her leg had got stuck inside a rift between two concrete drain covers in New Town. She was treated for her wounds and she underwent X-ray tests at a Salt Lake hospital before doctors allowed her to return home. While her elder son lives in Burdwan, her two daughters are married in Chandernagore and Kolkata. The woman, who earlier lived at Uttarpara in Hooghly, had shifted to a New Town complex last year to live with Anit, a private bank employee. “I always tell her not to go out alone. Whenever my wife and I leave for office, she goes out to buy household stuff by herself. She did the same on Tuesday. But we all salute her grit,” said Anit, who expressed his anguish over such a “death trap” on road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/she-kept-asking-me-to-stay-calm-recounts-son/articleshow/86243519.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

---||Surat||70% Surat’s new cases got one jab, no serious symptoms seen||Surat: With the daily count of new Covid cases remaining in the single digits, health officials of the Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) are breathing easy but are not letting their guard down. On Monday six cases were reported in the city as compared to just one on Tuesday. For the past one month the number of cases has remained two or less. With the pandemic in control at the moment, the health officials are closely monitoring the new cases so as to come up with steps to further contain the spread of the virus. They have observed that among the new cases almost 70% are those who have got at least one dose of anti-Covid vaccine. Though most of them do not have any serious symptoms, some elderly patients are showing minor illness. However, most of them don’t need hospitalization and are getting cured under home isolation. According to SMC health officials, among the eligible population — which accounts for all the registered voters — of the city almost 90% have got a single dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. “Of the positive cases more than half are vaccinated. Though the rise is minor we are not letting our guard down,” said a health official. Senior health officials claimed that the situation is not alarming as of now. The other noticeable aspect that the officials have noticed is that most of the new cases are from the same families.  “Of the six positive reports two or three cases are from the same families. If one person is found positive, we test other family members. In most cases one or more family members also test positive,” said a health official. As it happened during the second wave, due to high viral load and infectivity more than one family member is getting infected, officials informed. Meanwhile, health officials are continuing with identifying micro containment areas and isolating patients at home. “There will be a minor rise or drop in numbers but till the figures are in single digit it is not alarming. We are keeping close watch,” the official added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/70-surats-new-cases-got-one-jab-no-serious-symptoms-seen/articleshow/86241381.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

---||Jaipur||Kisan Sansad held in Jaipur, passes resolution on MSP||JAIPUR: The Kisan Sansad, organised at Birla Auditorium on Wednesday, passed a resolution to make a law ensuring legal guarantee on minimum support price (MSP) for agricultural produce and rejected all the three farm laws passed by the Centre. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot welcomed all the farmers participating in the Kisan Sansad. “I welcome all the farmers participating in the Kisan Sansad organised at Birla auditorium, Jaipur. Organising the event on the ‘Day of Democracy’ is important as our farmers have been leading an agitation against farm laws in a peaceful manner following democratic norms of protest,” Gehlot tweeted. “The farmers deserve much appreciation for their disciplined approach and the manner in which they carried the agitation for several months braving all odds, facing hardships and without losing hope. The Central government must listen to our farmers and resolve the issue. Farm laws must be taken back,” he added. The bill to ensure legal guarantee on minimum support price (MSP) was tabled at the Kisan Sansad by farmer leader from Rajasthan Himmat Singh. Samyukt Kisan Morcha’s Gurnam Singh Chaduni, Balbir Singh Rajewala, Darshan Pal Singh were nominated shadow ministers who gave their replies on the bill. Earlier, 542 members, who were nominated as MPs, participated in the discussion. The third resolution which was passed in the Sansad was to educate people in the villages about the three farm laws by organising ‘Kisan Sansad’ at the panchayat level. The sansad also took a decision to form a ‘kisan committee’ to discuss on a few key points of the bill on MSP. SKM leader Darshan Pal Singh said they had already rejected the Supreme court-appointed panel on farm laws. “The idea behind organising the Sansad is to spread the message, discuss and educate people about the three farms laws. We haven’t received any invitation from the government since the last meeting with them on January 22,” said Pal. “Today, we should pass a law ensuring legal guarantee on MSP in this sansad. Later, this law must be accepted by the Centre and should implement it.” Chaduni, meanwhile, said, “Every year the farmers in the country earn Rs 3 lakh crore less than the fixed MSP. The government says where shall we arrange that amount from? However, for the central and state government employees, under the 7th pay commission, the total salary increases by Rs 4 lakh crore every year. Therefore, we demand that farmers must get the benefit of 100 per cent MSP on agricultural produce that they sell in the market.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/kisan-sansad-held-in-jaipur-passes-resolution-on-msp/articleshow/86246022.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Drinks home-delivered? Hyderabad in 100% agreement||HYDERABAD: Home delivery of alcohol seems to be high on the list of must-haves among Hyderabadis. According to a recent eight-state study conducted by the International Spirits and Wines Association of India (ISWAI), Hyderabad is the only city where 100% of those surveyed, want the service to start soon. The average among most other prominent cities is around 70%. It was also observed that there is growing demand for home delivery of alco-bev in other parts of Telangana such as Nizamabad, Adilabad, Karimnagar, Warangal, Sangareddy and Nalgonda. As part of the survey titled ‘Consumer pulse on home delivery of liquor,’ ISWAI spoke to about 7,500 alcoholic beverage (alco-bev) consumers from the city. Of them, about 60% said they would use home delivery for convenience, while 40% cited social distancing and safety — in a post Covid-19 time — as reasons for voting in favour of the service. Further, while 50% preferred a flat fee of Rs 50 to Rs 100 on every home delivery the rest leaned towards a fee of 5% to 10% of the order value, capped at Rs 100. “We believe that metros and mini metros will be starting points for such progressive policies like home delivery of alcohol. We conducted this survey so that the citizen’s point of view can be offered to state governments,” said ISWAI CEO, Nita Kapoor. The association will soon share the findings from Hyderabad with the Telangana government to impress upon it the need for home delivery of liquor. Currently, states and Union Territories allowing the service are West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Assam, Odisha, Maharashtra, Meghalaya, Punjab and Puducherry. “Given the demand among citizens in all the states that we have surveyed, we believe that if the service is handled in a mature manner and with all the necessary regulations in place, going forward this could become a potential channel for growth of revenue for states,” Kapoor added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/drinks-home-delivered-hyd-in-100-agreement/articleshow/86244348.cms||Sudipta Sengupta

Niranjana Mutt Veerashaiva Samaja members said without hurting anyone’s sentiments, the government should take a decision in protecting the school and Niranjana Mutt, and also build a Vivekananda memorial.Drop the protest: AshramaMeanwhile, Sri Ramakrishna Ashrama authorities and its followers requested the agitators to drop the protest.Former MLC D Madegowda who spoke on behalf of the Ashrama requested activists to withdraw the protest and allow the Ashrama to build the memorial. “We will also be forced to protest peacefully to protect our property, if agitators dig their heels in. They should respect the law of the land and honour the orders of the courts, government and the authorities concerned and make way for the memorial. Members of Kannada and religious institutes should stop protesting,” he added.Arun Kumar, an advocate representing the Ashrama, said as per land records the property now belongs to the Ashrama. He said the Sri Ramakrishna Ashrama is the legal owner of the property and has every right over it, yet they are being ‘prevented’ from taking over its possession.

But a rumour of the central government contemplating its closure has sent residents of Kalaburagi into a tizzy. Consequently, concerned citizens have launched an online campaign to preserve the station. Given that only 20 employees are working at the station against the sanctioned strength of 91, many residents fear it could be a sign of its impending closure. In a reply to a question by then Rajya Sabha MP Basavaraj Patil Sedam on April 2, 2018, the Union ministry of information and broadcasting had stated that there were no plans to close down the high-power transmitted (HPT) in Kalaburagi. In its response, the ministry further added that only 37 employees were working at the station against its sanctioned strength of 91. President of Kalyan Karnataka Grahakara Vedike Sunil Kulkarni said that, despite there being no official statement from the Centre about the station’s closure, the en masse transfer of employees had triggered residents’ anxiety. “Transfer is a routine procedure in all government offices, but the vacant posts at the DD station in Kalaburagi are not being filled. This is a silent sign of the station being shut down,” Kulkarni told TOI. Founder-president of Kalyana Naadu Vikasa Vedike Muttanna Nadageri dubbed it yet another ‘setback’ to the region. Attributing the development to the apathetic attitude of the elected representatives, Nagageri said, “We lost the railway division, the proposed textile park was shelved, the proposal to establish AIIMS here did not materialise and the district continue to be deprived of the four-lane national highway. We are going to start an agitation demanding separate statehood for the region, which has been synonymous with backwardness since the days of the Nizam.” Citizens have taken to social media to air their grievances about the apathy of the elected representatives using the hashtag #KalaburagiOrphaned. ‘People should not be taken in by rumours’ Additional director general of Doordarshan, Bengaluru has informed us that he has received no official communication about the closure of DD Kendra Gulbarga. Transfer and reshuffling of staff is a common procedure at Prasar Bharati. We have urged the Union information and broadcasting minister Anurag Thakur and Prasar Bharti director general not to close the station. We are committed to retaining the station and studio facility in Kalaburagi forever. People should not be taken in by the rumours. - Umesh Jadhav | Lok Sabha MP, Kalaburagi||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/rumours-of-dd-kendra-gulbargas-closure-has-citizens-riled-up/articleshow/86239909.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

---||Kochi||Salute me, says actor-MP to Ollur SI||Thrissur: MP Suresh Gopi, on Wednesday courted controversy after he ordered Ollur SI Antony to exit his jeep and salute him. The officer obliged. He was visiting Puthoor area that witnessed a minor cyclone a couple of days ago. “I’m an MP and I deserve a salute. Don’t forget conventions and I’m not the mayor,” he said, referring to the recent controversy where Thrissur mayor MK Varghese wanted a salute from the police. Gopi also directed Antony to clear a portion of the road where logs, cut earlier, remained piled up. Retired officers and police association leaders said his action went against rules. They said the police standing order-7 lists the titles of officials and public servants whom the police are expected to salute. MLAs, MPs, and local body office-bearers aren’t in the list, they added. The list includes President, VP, governors, central-state ministers, senior policemen, generals in uniform, SC and HC judges. Police must salute if an armed military contingent moves in their area. Police are expected to salute corpses, they added. Retired SP Subhash Babu said police should salute judicial officers who are performing judicial functions at judicial premises. Kerala Police Officers Association general secretary CR Biju said the protocols the MP referred to could be related to seating arrangements of people’s representatives at a function and not the rules of salute. “Kerala Police are told clearly whom they should salute, right from their training days. SI Antony, on escort duty, must have saluted when Gopi demanded it, out of courtesy. It would have been embarrassing for Gopi, if Antony refused as the rules do not insist,” Biju said. Later, Gopi said he hadn’t behaved rudely. “I addressed him as sir. He was seated in his jeep and I mistook him for a forest officer. I wanted to remove the logs so that the people staying at SC colony can travel without problems and I called him,” he said. If government has instructed the police not to salute MPs, state home department should communicate it to Rajya Sabha chairman, who will then tell me, he quoted to news channels. Gopi said he never favoured protocols like saluting. But, if rules say so, they must salute all entitled people, without discrimination, he added. KSU district secretary VS David filed a complaint before the DGP seeking action against Gopi for his ‘immature behaviour’. Gopi, who distributed relief materials to the people, alleged that government officials were obstructing his initiatives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/salute-me-says-actor-mp-to-ollur-si/articleshow/86243597.cms||T Ramavarman
---||Kolkata||New Town woman third victim at same spot in 4 wks||Kolkata: The 65-year-old New Town resident, whose leg got trapped in an old drain cover amid a downpour on Tuesday, is the third person to suffer such a fate at the same spot in the past four weeks. While the two others, whose feet also got stuck in the concrete slab, could pull themselves out quickly enough, New Town resident Jayashree Roy Chowdhury had to remain stuck there in knee-deep water for over three hours because of waterlogging. Nothing could be seen through the water and the drain cover had to be dismantled to free the woman. “We had lodged complaints with NKDA twice earlier about the loose drain cover outside our complex but to no avail. It required an accident like the one on Tuesday for the authorities to finally react,” said Kalyan Bose, president of the residents’ welfare association at New Town DLF Heights, where Jayashree lives. Following the dramatic rescue operation involving cops, firemen, civic personnel and residents, many took to the social media to laud the “human efforts”, but most New Town residents posted their dissatisfaction with NKDA—custodian of the smart city—over poor civic amenities. “Why would such an incident happen... If the authorities carry out their duties, such accidents can be averted,” wrote Minakshi Sinha of Action Area III. Another New Town resident, R K Majumdar, posted, “Minimum basic infrastructure is not there. No proper drainage system...” Samaresh Das, chairperson of NTFN, an umbrella organization of residents’ forums in New Town, said they had requested NKDA to take every complaint seriously. “NKDA has been told about drains and manholes not being properly covered but this is not looked into,” said Das. But NKDA officials denied not paying heed. “On receiving complaints, our engineers attend to them. We have asked PHE officials to survey all manholes and drains and take action,” said NKDA chairman Debashis Sen. An NKDA engineer said, “Most slabs were put up 10 years ago. The edges have eroded, creating gaps.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/new-town-woman-third-victim-at-same-spot-in-4-wks/articleshow/86243548.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

The government audit agency said that there was no formal contract was signed by the SJED, nor did the department obtain performance security amounting Rs 28 lakh. In its report, CAG said that out the 370 SWSHs installed, 256 installed at the cost of Rs 2.89 crore were found non-functional for 5-38 months. All the 78 SWHSs installed in four residential schools were also non-functional for 15-38 months. The audit agency also found that pror inspection was not undertaken before delivery and installation of the SWHSs as prescribed in the order which the department had admitted. In fact, the department released payments of Rs 2.75 crore against the work orders of 2.89 crore without entering into a formal agreement. Similar was the case with another contract for providing material for cold water PVC storage tank where the department released the full amount of Rs 1.44 crore without having any formal contract. After the department was made aware of the violation, it said it would get the contractor to repair all the SWHSs. CAG in the report said that the contractor has failed to repair the systems and SJED count not initiate action against the contractor in the absence of a formal contract. The CAG saif the department should initiative appropriate action against the officers responsible for not safeguarding the interest of the public money or assets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rs-2-75cr-paid-sans-contract-but-water-heating-systems-remain-non-functional/articleshow/86245993.cms||---

The discussions regarding seat distribution in poll-bound UP is underway with BJP national president JP Nadda and home minister Amit Shah, he added. Athawale said his party will kick off the poll campaign by taking out Bahujan Kalyan Yatra from Saharanpur on September 26, which will culminate as a mammoth rally in Lucknow’s Ramabai Ambedkar Park on December 18, after covering several districts of Uttar Pradesh . Responding to a question, Athawale said neither BJP nor Prime Minister Narendra Modi were against the Muslim community and they believe in ‘sabka saath sabka vikas’. In response to a question over agitation of farmers, Athawale said those who are protesting do not come from the farming community, and claimed that 80% of the farmers are still with PM Modi and BJP. Athawale stressed on the need for inter-caste marriage and said this is an effective way to bring ‘samajik samrasta’ (social harmony) in today’s scenario. Over 1.25 lakhs inter-caste marriages have taken place in the country over the last few years, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/rpi-may-filed-candidateson-10-12-seats-athawale/articleshow/86246008.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: No polarisation politics, government’s schemes for welfare of all, says Smriti Irani||LUCKNOW: Union minister for women and child welfare Smriti Irani defended CM Yogi Adityanath for his ‘abba jaan’ remark, saying there was nothing objectionable as what he was doing was well within his constitutional rights. Irani was responding to a query if polarisation had assumed more importance than development in the run up to UP elections. Speaking at Navbharat Navnirman Manch conclave organised by Times Now Navbharat via video conferencing on Wednesday, Irani said once a senior leader had said that a particular community had the first right on national resources. “Wasn’t he pursuing politics of polarisation,” Irani asked, stressing that when CM Yogi dedicates a road, it is for all communities. “The welfare schemes of our government are benefiting all, irrespective of community and caste. The UP government is working on the mantra of ‘Justice for all, appeasement of none’,” she said. In fact, people will ask the opposition why they did not serve them the way the BJP government has done in the last four-and-half years, Irani added. “We are moving ahead with our agenda of development and nationalist policy,” she said. Snapping at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s tweet saying, “ Jo nafrat kare, woh Yogi kaisa?”, Irani said the person who wanted ‘ tukde-tukde’ of the country should refrain from dictating terms. जो नफ़रत करे,वह योगी कैसा!— Rahul Gandhi (@RahulGandhi) 1631604194000“Sometimes he wears a skull cap, sometimes he wears a robe… Such people should keep away from religion and politics,” she said. “The people who once spoke of ‘Hindu Terrorism’ are now rushing to temples,” she said, refering to Rahul’s visit to Vaishno Devi shrine. She also targeted SP chief Akhilesh Yadav for remembering Lord Krishna and said, “The vote of people is the ‘Sudarshan Chakra’ which will destroy all sinners.” Irani said her victory in Amethi in 2019 was a social revolution by the people who had been exploited for 50 years. “The people of Amethi made the ‘Yuvraj’ go down south,” Irani said, referring to Rahul contesting from Wayanad, Kerala. Responding to Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s proposed 12,000 km campaign titled ‘Hum Vachan Nibhayenge’, Irani said Congress has never kept its promises. “They gave ‘Gareebi Hatao’ slogan in the 1960s. Did they? They promised a medical college in Amethi 40 years ago. Did they,” she asked. Irani blamed the opposition for stoking the stir of farmers. “They got answer in recent UP panchayat elections when they got routed,” she said. Replying to the issue of 29.5% of UP’s population living below the poverty line, Irani said, “Challenges will always be there, but we will provide solutions. This is the pledge of the BJP government.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/no-polarisation-politics-govts-schemes-for-welfare-of-all-irani/articleshow/86247404.cms||Pankaj Shah

---||Hyderabad||Fed false hope by Pakistan, Nizam Mir Osman Ali Khan had delayed merger of Hyderabad with India||HYDERABAD: One of the reasons for the Nizam VII, Mir Osman Ali Khan, seeking time to think over the merger of Hyderabad state with the Indian Union was the false hope kindled in the princely ruler by Pakistan, if archival data is any indication. It was Pakistan who had pumped up the Nizam with the false hope during 1947-1948 that the entire Muslim world was with him in case of war between India and princely Hyderabad. Archival data reveal that Pakistan was in constant touch with the Laiq Ali ministry in Hyderabad creating false hopes for the Nizam. Laiq Ali was the prime minister of princely Hyderabad and incidentally the Nizam had accused him of usurping the power by coveted methods rendering him (Nizam) a mere puppet. International news reports of the period had exposed Pakistan how it had misled the Nizam and eulogised him expressing “unstinted” support. Archival data show that the Nizam was inflated by Pakistan to the extent that he had delayed his decision on the merger with the Indian Union by signing a standstill agreement. The delay in the merger had resulted in untold loss of life and property. A publication based in Afghanistan, a few months after the so-called Police Action on September 17, 1948, accused Pakistan of giving a “selfish and treacherous advice” to the Nizam that lead the princely state head to “adopt an unwise attitude.” It also put the entire blame on Pakistan for the political trouble and uncertainty in the princely state for almost 13 months after August 15, 1947 when the British left India, leaving the choice to princely states to decide their future. Another archival document shows that Pakistan had exploited the situation in Hyderabad for its “own selfinterest by playing the most sordid part.” It further said Pakistan had dinned “fantastic promises” into the ears of the Nizam. Pakistan had also employed Sidney Cotton to transport arms and weapons into Hyderabad in a bid to convince the princely ruler. And when the Nizam’s forces finally surrendered to the Indian Army, Pakistan had described the ruler as a traitor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/fed-false-hope-by-pak-nizam-had-delayed-merger-of-hyderabad-with-india/articleshow/86244074.cms||Syed Akbar

The approval came after Dr Reddy’s submitted the updated safety, immunogenicity and efficacy data of the Russian Phase-III trials of Sputnik Light. Noting that Dr Reddy’s has presented data on the safety and immunogenicity along with the longevity of the antibodies, which gives a measure of persistence of antibodies in the participants, the SEC said that after detailed deliberation it had recommended grant of permission for conduct of Phase III immune-bridging clinical trial in Indian population. However the SEC said the permission is subject to the condition that the “primary endpoint is assessed at day 42, 90 and 180 and the interim analysis can be conducted at day 42 as this data was not generated during the Sputnik V trial in India after the first dose, which was stated to be available up to day 21 only”, as per the minutes of the meeting uploaded on the CDSCO website. In June end, SEC had indicated that only the data from Russian trials was enough for granting approval to the single-jab Sputnik Light that has demonstrated an efficacy of 79.4% in Russian trials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sputnik-light-gets-dcgi-nod-for-phase-iii-trials-in-india/articleshow/86244473.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

Last year, eight students from Telangana secured 100 percentile marks. “In the last three sessions, I made some silly mistakes. But this time, especially after checking the key, I was certain that I would get 100 percentile,” Sharanya told TOI, adding that her preparation for the advanced exam was on course and she wanted to secure a seat in computer science engineering at IIT, Bombay. While Adarsh, whose parents are both doctors, said he was more confident in the third and fourth session as he had managed to delete Covid fear out of exam equation as he had already tested positive earlier. “I was confident that I would not contract the virus at the exam centre as I had just recovered from Covid-19. It helped me,” he said. This year, because of the pandemic, JEE (Main) was conducted in four sessions. NTA declared results by taking into consideration best NTA scores of all candidates who appeared in more than one session of the exam. NTA Score for Paper-2A (BArch) and Paper-2B (B Planning) will be declared at a later date.

Justice Mukta Gupta, hearing a plea by an accused who has been in custody for eight years in a case under UAPA and seeking a day-to-day hearing, granted four weeks to the registry to file the response. In a brief submission, the registry informed the bench that, as on July 31, 37 cases prosecuted by NIA were pending before the two designated courts in the Patiala House Court complex — a sessions judge and the district & sessions judge. The plea by accused Manzar Imam stated that there was a delay in trial in his case as there were only two designated courts that were also hearing non-NIA cases, including bail matters.

---||Hyderabad||Cotton, the silver-haired man who struck gold||Hyderabad: If there was one man who benefited most during the turmoil preceding the so-called Police Action on September 17, 1948, it was the notorious arms dealer and pilot, Frederick Sidney Cotton. He had made several sorties to the princely state of Hyderabad dumping arms and ammunition and smuggling people out of India. Even as the Indian Army was marching into Hyderabad, Cotton transported several people from the princely state to various locations outside India. In his last flight on September 16, 1948 he was supposed to move Razakar leader Qasim Rizvi out of Hyderabad to Pakistan, but the latter arrived at the Hakimpet airport a few moments late. Archival data reveals that Rizvi was running on the tarmac to board the last flight even as Cotton took off. The silver-haired man, as he was recognised those days, Cotton had dropped arms from his aircraft at Charminar. He was the most sought-after arms dealer of the era. A video footage by British Pathe showed how Cotton circled around Charminar flying low and dropping arms bundled in a gunny sack. He had also dropped arms at Bidar and Warangal airfields. Archival data reveal that the arms dealer had made about 200 trips and brought a hundred tonne of arms and ammunition through his four Lancasters. His crew was made of 30 foreigners, mostly British and American. With huge funds flowing into his pocket, Cotton paid about Rs 2,000 per hour to each of his crew members. This translates to roughly Rs 20 lakh at current gold prices. Cotton had ensured that all his operations were secret and his crew, who were put up in hotels in Hyderabad and Secunderabad, had signed the hotel registers with fictitious names.

HCA ombudsman Justice (retd) Deepak Verma had, in his interim order on July 4, 2021 suspended five apex council members, including vice-president Manoj. In his order dated September 7, Justice T Amarnath Goud said: “A serious allegation is levelled against the ombudsman that he is favouring and protecting HCA president Mohd Azharuddin.” The order further states that 107 out of 180 members at the AGM had resolved to appoint Justice (retd) Nisar Ahmed Kakru as the ombudsman and Justice (retd) Meena Kumari as the ethics officer. The judge also found fault for the manner in which the office-bearers were suspended despite two replies being filed by them (to a showcause notice) and without furnishing copies of complaints against the officials. “It violates the principles of natural justice. Second respondent [Justice Verma] has no power to suspend the office-bearers,” read the order and added that no meeting was held to appoint Justice Verma as the ombudsman. “It is only a unilateral decision of the third respondent [Azhar] and the validity of said appointment is sub-judice in the Supreme Court.” The order disqualifying lawfully appointed office-bearers is not sustainable, said Justice Goud and granted interim suspension.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/relief-for-hca-vp-as-hc-stays-suspension-order/articleshow/86244606.cms||Solomon S Kumar
---||Varanasi||Varanasi: As November 15 deadline looms, 69% work of KVT Dham completed||VARANASI: With only two months left for meeting the November 15 deadline of completing the ambitious over Rs 700 crores Kashi Vishwanath Dham project, concerned officials claimed that while 69% work has been completed so far, structural work of three buildings was started recently. Regarding the possibility of meeting the revised deadline, which was initially August-end, divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal said, “Of the total buildings proposed inside the KV Dham project area, structural work of 15 major buildings has been completed. Besides beginning the finishing and interior work in these 15 buildings, work of Mandir Chowk and Kashi Vishwanath temple’s main premises has also been finalized.” “Now, work of floor construction is taking place inside KVT premises. We are working at an accelerated pace to meet the deadline,” he added. Second wave of Covid-19 has not only delayed the work of the ambitious Kashi Vishwanath Dham (Corridor) project for the second consecutive year, but also led to rescheduling of its deadline. Now, instead of the deadline of August-end, the project’s initially sanctioned work is likely to be completed by November 15. New features like Ganga view point, which were added later to this project, will be completed later as formality of approval by the state government could also not be taken due to the second wave of Covid-19. Talking about the delay caused due to the second wave of Covid-19, Agrawal said, “The official leading the team of the company executing the KV Dham project had become Covid-19 positive himself. Not only this, but a large number of labourers, including many from West Bengal, had left for their places with the surge in Covid cases.” “Moreover, the wave also compelled the working agency to minimise manpower for maintaining social distancing at work sites as per Covid protocol. These factors hampered the progress of the project. However, we are still confident of completing the remaining work by November 15,” he added. After all barriers, including purchase of 296 buildings in the vicinity of KVT and their removal following approval of this ambitious project by the Yogi Adityanath government in December 2017 were scaled, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had the foundation of the project on March 9, 2018. The project was continuing at an accelerated pace till two waves of Covid-19 hampered it twice. “Despite the odds created by two waves of Covid-19, efforts continued for timely completion of the project,” said PWD executive engineer Sanjay Gore, who is supervising the project proposed to come up in an area of 5.30 lakh square feet. He said, “A total of 24 buildings are coming up in the KV Dham area. Of these, structural work of 15 has been 100% completed and further work, including finishing and interior is in progress. Work at nine buildings is in progress while construction of three has been started recently due to logistic reasons.” “Construction of jetty and its retaining wall at Manikarnika, Jalasen and Lalita ghats had already been completed,” he said adding, “In all, 69% work of KV Dham is complete and finalisation of exterior stone work has also started giving the glimpse of the beauty that this shrine will wear after completion.” On the occasion of Makar Sankranti in January 2020, the Gujarat- based company assigned the contract for KV Dham construction under the supervision of PWD had started work with a deadline of 18 months to complete the project. Before the commencement of construction, the state government had spent over Rs 300 for the purchase of 296 identified buildings after which a budget of Rs 347.5 crore was approved for the construction work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/as-nov-15-deadline-looms-69-work-of-kvt-dham-completed/articleshow/86246038.cms||Rajeev Dikshit
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Consider placing RTE kid in another school’||MUMBAI: After a student lost admission to a Bandra school under the Right to Education (RTE) Act because no committee was available to verify her documents during the pandemic last year, the Bombay high court directed the director of school education, Pune, to consider granting her admission in any other school for the current academic year. “The director is to consider her case sympathetically,” a bench of Justices Ramesh Dhanuka and Abhay Ahuja said in their Wednesday’s order on a petition by Mahim resident Aayat Shaikh (7). She was allotted IES Manik Vidyamandir, an ICSE school, in August 2020. A moth later, her mother visited the school to complete the admission formalities, but she was not admitted. The school’s advocate, Arvind Kothari, said there was discrepancy in the address mentioned in the Aadhaar card and the application form. But Shaikh’s advocate, Meenaz Kakalia, said the card has the permanent address on which an SRA project is being implemented and the application form mentions her temporary address in the same neighbourhood. Kakalia said the mother wanted to produce all documents for verification, but due to the pandemic, no panel was functioning. She could also not submit the leave-and-licence agreement. But Kothari said the panel was available for verification of documents and the school has admitted another student and its 23 RTE seats for 2020-21 are filled. “As no seats are available in the school, we cannot direct the school to admit the petitioner,” said the judges. Noting that the last grievance was made on July 7 before the director of school education, the HC directed him to dispose it of within two weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-consider-placing-rte-kid-in-another-school/articleshow/86246103.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Delhi||Delhi University opens doors again with riders, attendance low||NEW DELHI: The students of physics, chemistry, other science subjects and psychology (Honours) — though few in numbers — returned to Delhi University colleges after a gap of several months. Most of the mathematics and computer science students gave it a miss as they have been provided with free software for practical classes. The students who turned up to colleges on Wednesday mostly reside in Delhi-NCR. College principals are now hoping that outstation students will also gradually return. Aman Verma, a final-year student of Botany (H) at South Campus, said: “It is nice to be back to college after such a long time. Though very few of us are here, we hope others will come back soon. Last year passed without us attending any practical classes. I was worried this might affect us in our future studies.” While principal of Ramanujan College, SP Agarwal, claimed that the attendance was thin, the campus was reverberating with students after a long time. “I could see 40-50 students in the campus. Some were at the laboratory while some at the library. It’s mostly the students from Delhi-NCR. Others will hopefully come soon,” Agarwal added. At Aryabhatta College, the first set to return to the campus were psychology students. Manoj Sinha, principal of the college, said: “We had called two batches of 10 students each for their practical classes. Along with the practical, students were also given orientation on following Covid-appropriate behaviors. Outside the psychology lab, sanitisers were installed on Wednesday.” At North Campus, however, there were very few students. Almost 60% of the students in different colleges of North Campus are from outside the capital. At Ramjas College, too, student attendance was thin on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/du-opens-doors-again-with-riders-attendance-low/articleshow/86243625.cms||---

Krishnaraja MLA SA Ramadas and Nanjangud MLA B Harshvardhan are upset with Simha over his stance on the issue. Harshvardhan, in fact, has charged the MP with creating a nuisance.Simha, on the other hand, has justified his stance on the issue by stating that he was merely fighting for the cause of the Hindus. Recently, the Mahadevamma temple in Huchchagani village in Nanjangud assembly constituency was demolished following the issuance of an order by the Supreme Court. The demolition kicked up a storm, with leaders, cutting across political parties, condemning the action. Among those who opposed the demolition was former chief minister Siddaramaiah. Simha visited the site where the temple had stood and made a vow to have it reconstructed.Nanjangud MLA Harshvardhan said, “He is creating a nuisance in my constituency. This is the second time he is stirring up trouble in Nanjangud. When a pharmaceutical company in Nanjangud turned into the epicentre for the Covid-19 cluster case, he had kicked up a storm.”He pointed out that he had protected 13 of the 15 temples marked for demolition. “Most number of temples were demolished in Udupi and Dakshina Kannada districts. Simha must question the demolition of temples everywhere. The demolition drive was carried out in accordance with the order of the Supreme Court. A similar drive was undertaken in Gujarat as well. I do not know if such a drive can be stopped,” Harshvardhan said.The Nanjangud MLA accused Simha of indulging in ‘caste’ politics. “Huchchagani village boasts a considerable population of Vokkaligas. The temple was only 15 years old; had it been a heritage structure, why was it not protected by the Archaeological Survey of India,” Harshvardhan said.Ramadas too expressed displeasure over Simha’s remarks. “Efforts are being made to protect the temples legally. My opinion is very different to Simha’s on this issue. The 101 Ganapathi temple in Agrahara will be protected. There is no threat to the temple,” Ramadas said.Defending his stance on the issue, Simha said, “I am, first and foremost, a Hindu. I come from a family of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh volunteers. My father was an RSS activist.” He, however, refused to comment on the statements made by MLAs of his party. “The people are with me, which is enough,” Simha added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/temple-demolition-bjp-mlas-upset-with-simha/articleshow/86238748.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Ramlila organisers disappointed as stage set for another year of losses||NEW DELHI: Organisers of Ramlilas in the capital are feeling disappointed as no permission for social/cultural/religious/festival gatherings and congregations has been given in the DDMA guidelines that were issued on Wednesday. Some of them have already submitted fees for booking the venues and made event-related arrangements. Last year also, Ramlila events could not be organised in many places as permission was granted just five days before the festival, said traders. Lav Kush Ramlila Committee secretary Arjun Kumar said that the organisers were disappointed and were planning to meet the lieutenant governor soon in this regard. “We have submitted the fees and obtained possession from ASI, but the event would be held subject to permission from DDMA. We are planning to meet LG on this issue and expect some positive development in DDMA’s October 1 guidelines. We have booked artistes from Mumbai, prepared 150 ethnic dresses and recorded 40 songs which will be played during the event,” said Kumar. Vijay Sarathi, head of Sri Ramlila Committee, says that they have given up the hope to hold the event even this time. “Preparations start at least two months before the event. We finalise the artistes, start rehearsals and do other bookings for decoration and stalls. But nothing has started so far this year because Ramlila Maidan has been converted into a 500-bed Covid Care Centre by Delhi government. Even then, we have applied for permission. If the event is not allowed, actors and organisers will be disappointed. Last year, the decision came hardly five days before, and that too with a lot of restrictions. We can’t take risks unless we get a nod well in advance,” he said. “Our Ramilila is the oldest in Delhi and was started by Mughal king Bahadur Shah Zafar around 180 years ago for his army. Artistes from Moradabad, Mathura and other parts of the country are called to perform here,” said Sarathi. Avtar Singh, a former mayor and councillor from Kashmere Gate, said, “Preparations for Ramlila usually begin months in advance. We have done the Bhoomi Pujan but not yet received a nod from DDMA.” As general secretary of Shri Navyuvak Ramlila Committee, he has written to Delhi government to take some steps for organising the event. BJP functionary Narendra Chawla said that the guidelines, if released too late, would automatically dissuade many to hold the event considering preparation starts at least a month in advance in the national capital. “The south corporation is giving a nod for holding events but referring them to district magistrate for final approval,” said Chawla, former south Delhi mayor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ramlila-organisers-disappointed-as-stage-set-for-another-year-of-losses/articleshow/86243588.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Kolkata||West Bengal boy gets 100 percentile, ranks 18th in JEE Mains||KOLKATA: Fever, tuberculosis and a surgery could not come in the way of Bratin Mandal’s success. Mandal on Wednesday emerged as the only student from Bengal among 44 candidates across the country to have scored a 100 percentile in JEE (Mains). The boy from Shantipur on Nadia has an all-India rank of 18. Bratin, who came third in state JEE, has secured a berth in IISc, Bangalore but he still wants to appear for JEE (Advanced) to take a shot at IIT Delhi. Bratin’s parents, Biplab Mandal and Bijali Khan, both high school physics teachers, said he was so determined to do well in the exams that he had confined himself to a room for most part of the past one and a half years. “He didn’t step out of home the past year and that led to severe Vitamin-D deficiency. This, in turn, caused tuberculosis. Bratin had to undergo surgery for treatment,” said his father. Bratin, who is now recovering after his surgery, is still under medication. When he had appeared for Bengal JEE, he had high fever, but he still came third. Bratin has won Kishore Vaigyanik Protsahan Yojana (KVPY) fellowship to study an integrated five-year science post-graduate course in IISc Bangalore. “My aim is to study core science subjects and then, go into research. Engineering is not my first preference. I would want to appear for JEE (Advanced) as I want to take a chance for IIT Delhi. There, too, I want to study core subjects,” he said. Bratin says he owes his love for science partly to his parents, both of them physics teachers. His father said, “We never pressured him for his subject choices. We believe he should pursue his dreams.” But the student of Shantipur Municipal High School is not quite happy with his HS marks, where he scored 470 out of 500. He applied for a revision. “After the correction, it increased to 484 but that is still a few numbers short of expectation,” . his father said. FITJEE Kolkata head Debdeep Banerjee said, “All-India Rank 18 is commendable for a state board student. That means if someone is focused on competitive exams, he or she can do well.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengal-boy-gets-100-percentile-ranks-18th-in-jee-mains/articleshow/86243593.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Pay bills, KSEB tells all consumers||T’puram: KSEB lifted the four-month old moratorium it had imposed on disconnection of domestic and commercial power connections as power bill arrears from these categories zoomed past Rs 1,400 crore and left it on the brink of a financial breakdown. Following the introduction of lockdown restrictions, KSEB was not pursuing power tariff collection aggressively. Though it started lifting relaxations given in tariff payment after the first wave, the advent of the second wave and conduct of assembly election forced it to toe the line of political bosses by suspending disconnection. KSEB has one of the highest bill realization rates in the county as it used to collect more than 99% of the demand notices it serves. It decided to collect dues from domestic and commercial consumers as the severity of financial stress, brought about by the moratorium on disconnection of services to bill defaulters, started affecting KSEB’s day-to-day activities. As per the order that gave a green signal to issue disconnection notice to LT consumers, as on July 31, the arrears from domestic and commercial category of consumers have reached Rs 1,389.42 crore. Many consumers with huge consumption aren’t remitting any amount (current charges) due to the suspension of disconnection activities against defaulters. Accordingly, the CMD accords sanction to use disconnection notice to all defaulted LT consumers, giving 21 days’ time to clear dues, stated the order. Despite non-realization of energy bills served to departments like KWA, KSEB was managing its finances by ensuring maximum possible realisation of bills served to other consumers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/pay-bills-kseb-tells-all-consumers/articleshow/86243668.cms||B S Anilkumar

Officials claimed the boy was in good health and they would get him checked for sexual assault. They said since the boy’s father did not live with him and his maternal grandparents would be unable to take care of him properly, he has been accommodated at the shelter. Rajasthan state commission for protection of child rights (RSCPCR) chairperson Sangeeta Beniwal said, “I have met the child and while he is quite cheerful, he does miss his mother a lot. Looking at the situation, it appears that he will have to stay for a while at the shelter. We are continuously monitoring the situation and ensure that the child stays well.” The purported video showed Rajasthan Police Service (RPS) officer Heeralal Saini and a woman constable in a semi-nude condition indulging in sexual activities, even as the minor boy, reported to be the constable’s son, was present in the same pool. The Special Operations Group (SOG) had registered a case under Pocso based on obscene videos of two cops in the presence of a six-year-old boy in a swimming pool that went viral on social media. According to the report, an unidentified person sent the copies of two videos in a pen drive via post to the police officials mentioning that as a concerned citizen he was deeply disturbed with the recordings that showed a police official molesting the child. The report said the video was of a five-star hotel in Pushkar.

---||Chandigarh||Controversy hits Saragarhi statue in Britain after Akal Takht jathedar visit||London: The unveiling of the Saragarhi statue in Wolverhampton last weekend has been mired in controversy after a Sikh group criticised the attendance of Akal Takht jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh, who flew from India, as well as the design and cost of the memorial. The memorial commemorates the Battle of Saragarhi, which saw 21 soldiers from the 36th Sikh Regiment pitted against thousands of Afghan tribesmen. It was commissioned by Wednesfield’s Guru Nanak Gurdwara. The Sikh Press Association, in an Instagram post, said: “Last month UK Sikh community figure Sukhjeevan Singh wrote an open letter criticising Harpreet Singh’s attendance for the unveiling. Many believe the jathedar should only give official support to Sikh specific causes, thus not those fighting for the British crown. Furthermore, the jathedar is comparatively silent on current British Sikh issues, such as the #westmidlands3 trial and #FreeJaggiNow campaign.” “Westmindlands3” refers to the extradition hearing next Wednesday at Westminster magistrates’ court of three British-born Sikh men, Gursharanvir Singh Wahiwala, Amritivir Singh Wahiwala and Piara Singh Gill, who live in the West Midlands, who India is seeking to extradite to face charges of conspiracy to a murder in India in 2009. The post also condemned the statue for the words “sooraa so pahichaanee-ai jo larai deen kay hayt purjaa purjaa kat marai kabhoo na chhaadai khayt” by Guru Gobind Singh Ji engraved on it beneath the feet of the statue of Havildar Ishar Singh, who led the 21 Sikh soldiers. “Gurbani (Guru’s words) is mandated to be revered as the gurus themselves, thus barring it being put on anything that won’t be kept protected and treated respectfully at all times,” the Sikh Press Association Instagram post said. “Finally, many have criticised the cost of the statue, with £100,000 (Rs 1 crore) of local gurdwara money being used for it. Many feel this money could be better spent by the Sikh community, especially in consideration of the Sikh practice of seva (service) and current global issues,” the post said. The gurdwara congregation raised £100,000 for the monument and the City of Wolverhampton Council contributed £35,000 (Rs 35 lakh) after it agreed to transfer land to the gurdwara on a 99-year lease. Wolverhampton city councillor Bhupinder Gakhal, who worked closely with Guru Nanak Gurdwara to develop the memorial, said: “We have covered up those words and we will take the slab out and put in a new slab with those words left out so there will be no Gurbani text on it. When this was brought to our attention on Sunday evening, we immediately said we have made a terrible mistake and sent out a video apologising. We were very honoured to have the jathedar of the Akal Takht attend the unveiling. These were Sikh soldiers who were defeated at the Saragarhi outpost who sacrificed their lives and we are commemorating their bravery, along with all the other Sikh soldiers who fought in both world wars. The jathedar was invited to meet West Midlands Police at Lloyd House in Birmingham, and if he had attended he could have raised his concerns about these issues. But these very people said the jathedar should not go to Lloyd House or speak with the police so he decided he did not want to upset the Sikh community.” And regarding the cost, he said: “We feel these 21 soldiers deserve everything and we feel that is a very small contribution, what we have done, and they have got worldwide fame and everyone will now know the history of Saragarhi.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/controversy-hits-saragarhi-statue-in-britain-after-akal-takht-jathedar-visit/articleshow/86246095.cms||NAOMI CANTON

While Jaipur resident Mridul Agarwal studied in ALLEN Career Institute here, Siddhant Mukherjee from Delhi and Anshul Verma from Raipur honed their skills from the same coaching centre in Kota. All of them scored 300/300. Siddhant, who has already got admission in the University of Cambridge to study computer science, will appear for his JEE-Advance exam in October. Calculations of other students who are among the top 50 are currently underway. Director of ALLEN Career Institute Brijesh Maheshwari said six students from the institute secured the top rank (All India Rank-1) in JEE-Mains. This apart, there are a good number of students who are in the top 100 as well. Despite the adverse circumstances triggered by Covid, students continued their hard work and teachers supported them wherever needed, Maheshwari said. Thousands of students from across the country come to Rajasthan every year to prepare for JEE and NEET. Initially, the pandemic delivered a major blow and impacted studies for a few months, but later with the start of online classes, the situation eased for students. Motion Education P. Ltd coaching director Nitin Vijay said their students proved their mettle again. Four students from the institute were among the top 100. He said the institute would continue to encourage students and provide the best education so that they could give their best. Vibrant Academy’s students also performed well in JEE-Mains. Director Mahendra Singh Chouhan said while one student was ranked in the top 100, 729 had qualified for the JEE-Advance to be held in October.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/3-students-from-jaipur-kota-among-18-bright-minds-who-aced-jee-main/articleshow/86246069.cms||---
---||Delhi||How two new drains can prevent Delhi's IGI from turning into a sea port again||NEW DELHI: Images of a waterlogged Indira Gandhi International Airport made the rounds on social media on Saturday. Though uncomplimentary, the sight portrayed in the videos isn’t rare. Each time, there has been intense showers in Delhi, the airport has suffered. But work is in progress to rectify the problem. Delhi International Airport Ltd has held a series of meetings with state and central government agencies over the last three years, mostly to find ways to widen the underground drainage system and create new drains to manage the excessive runoff during the monsoon season. Now, there are plans to create two additional drains, one on the southern air parcel and one on the northern air parcel. However, while one is awaiting the approval of the forest and wildlife department though Delhi Development Authority has cleared it, the other is yet to get the right-of-way approval from DDA, despite clearances given by other agencies, including PWD, the constructing agency. Based on the topography of the 2,500 acres on which IGIA stands, the land has been divided into two parts: a northern air parcel and a southern air parcel. While the former includes Terminal 1, Terminal 2 and the air cargo operations, the latter incorporates Terminal 3 operations. Sources at the airport said the northern air parcel gets impacted more by heavy showers, with DDA’s network of drains, 2.5 metres wide and 1 metre deep, inadequate for the monsoon rainwater. “Even 20mm of rainfall is enough to cause waterlogging on the northern side, with additional rainwater from the Mahipalpur junction and NHAI flowing into the northern access underpass and causing waterlogging there,” said the source. “There is no drainage facility in the vicinity to prevent water accumulation and the water flows to the airport’s northern side and collects at the western end near the northern main runway funnel area.” The initial discussions on remedying this problem began in 2014. After meetings among stakeholders, DDA awarded the consultancy to IIT Roorkee in 2015 and two years later the new drain alignment was finalised. After DDA received funds from the Union urban development ministry in 2019 for the work, a private company was awarded the contract for the construction of the drain. However, the project is yet to receive clearance from the Delhi government’s forest and wildlife department. TOI has accessed documents related to recent meetings among DIAL, Delhi government, DDA, PWD and irrigation & flood control department. While an existing four-cell box culvert drain, 12 metres wide and 2.75 metres deep, exists towards the southern parcel, it can only handle a rainfall of around 60mm before succumbing to waterlogging at the T3 forecourt. A source said a steep gradient of 17 metres between NH8 and T3 worsens the situation, with water gushing towards the airport from the Radisson hotel and its adjacent areas. DIAL proposed an additional drain for the airport. In discussions with Delhi government and the other agencies, a right-of-way consent was agreed upon. However, the consent of DDA has yet to materialise. DDA did not respond to TOI's queries. On the southern parcel, PWD and the irrigation & flood control department constructed the southern outfall outside the airport when T3 was being constructed. DIAL, at present, also has a maintenance contractor, who cleans and jets all clogged drains within the airport boundary, including the rainwater harvesting pits. When TOI contacted DIAL, a spokesperson reiterated that Saturday’s waterlogging was largely due to the steep gradient between NH8 and T3. “The gradient renders the location a rainwater catchment area and channels water towards the terminal,” the spokesperson explained. “DIAL has been working with state and central government bodies for the past few years with a request to widen the underground drainage system at the airport. Several discussions on this matter have already taken place.” A forest official, when asked about the drain project, told TOI that inspections had been carried out and clearance would be given after assessing the total number of trees that will be impacted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-2-new-drains-can-prevent-igi-from-turning-into-a-sea-port-again/articleshow/86243633.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

In Nagpur, Ifrah Khan with AIR 93 is the probable topper followed by Sai Poreddiwar (AIR 228) and Parth Kasture (AIR 529). TOI uses the word ‘probable’ for sorting out toppers at city/district level because the exam conducting body, National Testing Agency (NTA), releases details of tops scorers only at national and state-level. For IIT admissions, students will now have to appear for JEE-Advanced exam. Ifrah, who wants to pursue computer science in a top IIT, said, “My teachers at the Indian Olympiad School helped me to prepare for this crucial exam after my initial foundation for the test was laid at ICAD and KDM coaching institutes.” Sai and Parth, both students of Allen Career Institute, too want to take up computer science at a top rated IIT. Parth said, “I would prefer IIT-Bombay, but any of the top seven institutes would also do.” Sai could not be reached over the phone. Staff at Allen said he too would prefer a high rated IIT. The examination consists of two papers of which Paper-1 is for the engineering entrance and is the most competitive. Paper-2 is for those seeking admission in architecure courses. JEE-Mains being a completely online exam is held multiple times in a year and students have the option of appearing for all. In such cases, the best score is taken as the final one. JEE-Mains was conducted in 925 centers in 334 cities. A central control room was opened to monitor and facilitate the smooth conduct of the examination on the ground. Two national coordinators, six regional coordinators, 287 city coordinators, and approximately 800 observers were present during the conduct of the exams. As per details provided by NTA, 44 candidates have received scored 100 percentile. Live CCTV surveillance had been planned in all examination centres to curb malpractices in the examination. The NTA also made arrangements for live viewing of remote locations and recording CCTVs systems of all examination centres from the control room located at the NTA premises of New Delhi.

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: 30 children of 150 families rescued from begging||JAIPUR: The Rajasthan State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (RSCPCR) held a meeting on Wednesday with various stakeholders, including representatives of 38 NGOs to take the feedback of their work during the pandemic as well as the issues faced by them during the same. The panel asked the NGOs to come up with suggestions regarding ways to ensure that children who have dropped out of school during the lockdown and forced into labour are encouraged to pursue their education. “While the work done by all the organisations for children especially during the pandemic is commendable, we need to focus on ways for the children to go back to school now. Some of them might have dropped out but the people working on ground have to ensure that this is not permanent by talking to the minors as well as their guardians/parents,” said Sangeeta Beniwal, chairperson, RSCPCR. During the meeting it was informed that in the campaign against begging which is underway in the city, a total of 30 children from 150 families have been rescued in the past few weeks. The rescued children have been kept in government accommodation and out of the 30 children, nine were those who did not have parents. Recently, the child commission has drafted the SOP for an intensive campaign against child begging across the state. The SOP was drafted after the initial campaign did not give the expected results and it was found that more coordination was required between states and while children were being rescued successfully, their rehabilitation continued to be irregular which would also be an area of focus in the coming days. One of the measures for eradication would be to that employment would be provided by surveying the beggars by linking them with skill training programmes which would solve economic problems and help in eradicating begging.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/30-children-of-150-families-rescued-from-begging/articleshow/86246070.cms||---

Kuvempunagar Government First Grade College history department head SG Ramadasa Reddy, along with research student BS Charan Kumar and NSS students NL Puneet Kumar found the megalithic site and veeragallu at the village coming under Hullahalli hobli near Kapila river. The site is around 30kms from Mysuru, he stated on Wednesday. The huge prehistoric stone tomb was found at the banana plantation belonging to one Basappa in the village. Reddy and team have found small red and black coloured pieces of pot, iron ore and other prehistoric materials at the site. Reddy believes that the place was once used as a store for grains. The team has also discovered five veeragallu at the premises of Adhishakti Mahadevamma temple which was in the controversy recently as district administration had taken up a demolition drive. The temple is believed to be built by Cholas.Reddy said the idols at Adhishakti Mahadevamma temple and the adjacent Bairaveshwara temple are made of iron and belong to the Chola period. Cholas ruled the region between 11th and 12th century as per Epigraphia Carnatica. “While four veeragallu mastigallu were found at the temple premises, one veeragallu was found at the banana plantation. The veera mastigallu are around 6.5ft tall , 3.4 feet wide and 7inch thick. The stone had carvings of warriors holding swords, mahasati, devakanya and Sri Krishna playing flute,” he said.Reddy opined that as the stones have Krishna carvings, it can be ascertained that the region has an influence of Vaishnava dharma. The megalithic site and veeragallu must be protected by departments concerned , he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/remains-of-megalithic-site-found-near-demolished-temple/articleshow/86238842.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan HC grants bail to Indra Bishnoi in Bhanwari Devi murder case||JODHPUR: Alleged to be the mastermind of the sensational Bhanwari Devi abduction and murder case, Indra Bishnoi was granted bail by the Rajasthan High Court on Wednesday. She is the last of all the 17 accused of the case to have got the bail. Before this, all the 16 accused have been granted bail by the high court. Indra was also the last to be arrested by the CBI in the case, over about five years of arrest warrant against her, and had a cash reward of Rs 5 lakh on her head. The CBI, however, had protested the bail plea of Indra stating that she had absconded for a long time evading the arrest until she was finally arrested in 2017. But her counsels argued that all the accused of the case including the main accused have already been granted bail, she also deserved to be granted bail. Admitting the arguments, Justice Dinesh Mehta allowed the application and granted bail to Indra. Like all the accused, she also had moved the high court after the lower court had rejected her bail plea. It is interesting to note that the decision of granting bail to an accused of the case Parasram Bishnoi on June 27 by the Supreme Court became instrumental in grant of bail to all the remaining 16 accused by the high court. It may be noted that Indra had been termed as the main conspirator of the case by the CBI, who had hatched entire plan. Just before her arrest, Indra had absconded in December 2011 and led a life hiding from everybody disguising as a sage at a temple in MP. The CBI had also declared a cash reward of Rs 5 lakh to any information leading to her whereabouts. She was finally arrested in 2017 and was remanded in judicial custody. In order to build pressure on her to surrender, the government had also seized her house and had tried to sell it through an open auction but nobody did come forward for the deal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/hc-grants-bail-to-indra-bishnoi-in-bhanwari-devi-murder-case/articleshow/86246130.cms||---
---||Delhi||Covid effect: Heinous crimes dip, cyber fraud up in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Crime in the time of Covid had a lesser sting for the city than the year earlier. The patrolling of the capital’s roads to enforce pandemic regulations appeared to have kept street crime and crimes against women in check. However, perhaps because of the online dependence for most activities during the period, cybercrime saw a relative spurt. These trends were revealed on Wednesday when the National Crime Records Bureau statistics for 2020 were released. Cases of rape reported by women dipped by 21% in Delhi in 2020 in comparison with the previous year. The overall crimes against women in Delhi went down by 24%. Cybercrime, however, saw a significant rise of 55% in the city. The Covid lockdown in 2010 was a major factor that deterred street criminals and those who would commit crimes against women. NCRB put the number of crimes against women in 2020 at 9,782, much lower than the 12,902 reported in 2019. Against 1,231 cases of rape in 2019, there were a much lower 967 last year, a dip of 21%. Cases of assault against women also slid to 938 in 2020 from 1,088 the previous year. Women also reported 644 cases of sexual harassment when in 2019 they had registered 862. There was also a significant 40% decrease in cases of stalking in 2020. The data shows that 235 cases of stalking were reported to the cops against 388 the previous year. Police officers believed these were the result of Covid measures such as intensifying night patrolling and tightening security on the streets round the clock. “Patrolling and checking were intensified at night,” an officer said. “Police presence was also adequately enhanced to prevent untoward incidents in localities.” Across 19 metropolitan cities in India too, there was a 21% decrease in crimes against women, according to the NCRB data. Against the total of 44,738 cases recorded in 2019, there were 35,331 cases of crime against women registered in 2020. The data shows that 30.2% of these cases pertained to either cruelty by husband or his relatives while 197% were cases of assault on women with intent to outrage her modesty. Kidnapping and abduction of women followed with 19% and 7.2%. The lockdown and the restrictions placed on public interactions also played a vital role in keeping street crimes low in 2020. “Through the lockdown and despite the pandemic, our personnel stood guard on roads and in public for the safety of Delhiites," the officer said. Cybercrime, however, soared by 55% in Delhi. Against 107 reported crimes in 2019, there were 166 in 2020. A major chunk of these crimes — 59 in 2020 — related to transmitting of sexually explicit content on the internet. Such cases had numbered just 19 a year earlier. Cyber fraud too saw an upward trend, increasing to 31 cases from 11, though cyber stalking cases fell to 12 from 16 in 2019. Cases of online bank frauds also increased to 19 in 2020 from a mere two the previous year. “There was a rise in the various categories of cybercrime in 2020,” a police officer said. “One of the reasons why online crimes went up was also due to the lockdown. We detected numerous cases of fake job rackets, fake lotteries, people being duped while being promised Covid medicines and home delivery of other items when the city was at a standstill. Our cybercrime teams in each district registered and probed all cases diligently. Arrests were made in most of these cases."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-effect-heinous-crimes-dip-cyber-fraud-up/articleshow/86243735.cms||---

Now, the commissioner for departmental inquiry will conduct a probe into the matter before taking any action against him, which may result in termination of his job. An inquiry by Public Health Engineering Department (PHED) found that the chief engineer had obtained a compassionate appointment by producing a false affidavit of being unemployed. He forged documents — in violation of the Rajasthan compassionate appointment of dependents of deceased government servant rules, 1996 — following the death of his father, who was posted in the forest department. PHED conducted an inquiry after convener of state Congress’ grievance cell Pankaj Sharma submitted a memorandum to PHED minister B D Kalla. At the time of inquiry when PHED sought guidance from DOP on the matter, it stated that in violation of Rule-5 of the Rajasthan compassionate appointment of dependents of deceased government servant rules (1996), as it appears that Chauhan was was already holding the post of junior engineer in PWD, the employee should be dismissed from services as per CCA rules for producing fake certificates to obtain compassionate appointment as assistant engineer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/chargesheet-issued-against-phed-engineer/articleshow/86246101.cms||---
---||Kolkata||24 hrs on, city pockets still under water due to poor drainage, overflowing canal||Kolkata: Though storm water receded from large parts of the city, which were inundated on Tuesday after spells of heavy rain, some pockets remained waterlogged till Wednesday night because of a poor drainage network. KMC sewerage and drainage department officials conceded that water could not be drained out of low-lying areas, including Behala, Kidderpore, large areas off EM Bypass and some stretches in Golf Green-Lake Gardens. The Shakuntala Park-Sarsuna belt in Behala was one of the affected areas, where residents had to wade through knee-deep water even on Wednesday morning. App cabs refused to enter the flooded areas. Avijit Ghosh, a resident of Sarsuna, said all drivers refused his bookings. “I had to visit a private hospital off EM Bypass. Having failed to convince app cab drivers about my urgency to hire a taxi, I cancelled the appointment,” said Ghosh. Residents of a government housing complex at Charu Chandra Place (east) also found it difficult to resume their daily routine even on Wednesday after being confined to their homes the whole of Tuesday. Senior citizen Suchitra Pal, a resident, said she could not even go to the market. In several areas in Ekbalpore-Kidderpore, water did not recede till late on Wednesday afternoon. Similarly, residents in areas off EM Bypass, including Mukundapur, Madurdaha and Patuli, were also watered in. According to a KMC drainage department official, the civic body had to struggle to flush out storm water from several Behala and EM Bypass areas due to a poor drainage network. “We used portable pumps to flush out water from low-lying areas, where we don’t have a fool-proof drainage network,” said a KMC official. Several parts of New Town, largely in Action Area II, and adjacent Rajarhat areas remained under water till Wednesday afternoon due to the overflowing canal. NKDA workers spent much of Wednesday, clearing drainage outlets. “The roads in front of our complex went under water and the level did not change even 24 hours after the downpour. Water from the adjacent Rajarhat main road area, was pumped into this area,” said Kingshuk Chakraborty, a resident of Greenfield Ambition. Residents also said household waste thrown by the roads blocked the gullypits and choked the pipes. “Waste from roadside stalls are dumped in drains, which get clogged and cause waterlogging,” said Bijoy Das of Akansha complex.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/24-hrs-on-city-pockets-still-under-water-due-to-poor-drainage-overflowing-canal/articleshow/86243793.cms||Saikat Ray

However, the gurdwara management has denied receiving any letter from the authorities. A letter allegedly written on the letterhead of ACRO Criminal Records Office, UK, on September 14 to the trustees of Guru Nanak Gurdwara Wednesfield, Wolverhampton, UK, reads: “We have been made aware that an event held or organised by your institution on the 12th of September was attended by an individual named Harpreet Singh... arrived in the UK from India... We are aware that Mr Singh was obliged under the coronavirus regulations to self-isolate for a minimum of 10 days”. It further states that failure to adhere to the regulations was punishable with a fine of up to 10,000 pounds. Denying receipt of any such letter, Guru Nanak Gurdwara, Wolverhampton, secretary Paramjit Singh Dhadi on Wednesday said, “This is a bogus letter... Earlier also canards were spread that the statue of Havildar Ischar Singh was being installed inside the gurdwara. In reality, it is installed on the government land,” he said. The Akal Takht jathedar had unveiled the statue of Saragarhi hero Havildar Ischar Singh near Guru Nanak Gurdwara, Wolverhampton, a few days back. The UK no longer has face mask rules or social distancing rules, all were lifted on July 19. The jathedar breached the self-isolation rules for arriving from an amber country (India.) He did not home quarantine for 10 days as he was meant to by law. Wednesfield Wolverhampton councilor Bhupinder Singh, who had spearheaded the statue project, said, “All I can say is that ACRO does not communicate this way, If you look at this letter closely, you will see spelling errors. Sadly, I think that certain people are not happy about the success of this Saragarhi monument and would like to divert attention from it.” He added that the gurdwara management has not received any letter from ACRO till date. “This is probably a hoax.” he said. BOX Fake FPN: ACRO Criminal Records Office In reply to a query by TOI, ACRO Criminal Records Office corporate communications officer Gillian Ainsley said, “ACRO Criminal Records Office is aware of a fake fixed penalty notice (FPN) letter, which has been circulated on social media. The letter, dated September 14, 2021, and addressed to the Trustees of Guru Nanak Gurdwara Wednesfield, is not a genuine FPN and was not issued by ACRO Criminal Records Office.” ACRO is a national police unit supporting the policing response to the Covid-19 pandemic by administering FPNs issued under coronavirus legislation, on behalf of police forces in England and Wales.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/row-over-letter-by-police-on-covid-violations-by-jathedar-during-uk-visit/articleshow/86246153.cms||Yudhvir Rana
---||Surat||Udhna station transformation plan on track||Surat: The objective of transforming a few railway stations into ‘Railopolis’ to provide state-of-the-art amenities at par with those of an international airport and world- class experience to the travellers seems to be on track and gaining speed. Fourteen leading developers, funds and consultants with prominent players like Adani, Kalpataru Group, Cube Constructions, JKB Infrastructure, GMR, MBL Infra, and Monte Carlo participated in a pre-bid meeting held on Tuesday regarding re-development of Udaipur, Surat and Udhna Railway Stations. “The pre-bid meeting was conducted by Indian Railway Stations Development Corporation (IRSDC), mandated to redevelop these three stations. The objective of redevelopment is to transform these railway stations into ‘Railopolis’,” said the statement. “We are enthused by the overwhelming response in this pre-bid meeting as well regarding re-development of the three railway stations. The stations will be redeveloped in line with global standards and will confer several benefits in terms of improved connectivity, multi-modal transport integration and boosting retail and real estate. It will also lead to the generation of employment opportunities, thereby ushering a socio-economic transformation of the respective regions,” said S K Lohia, MD and CEO of IRSDC in a statement. The Udaipur railway station will be re-developed on a Design-Build Finance Operate Transfer (DBFOT) model on the principle of Transit-Oriented Development (TOD). The total area for development is 4,98,115square metre (sqm) and the built-up area for station estate development is up to 1,01,374sqm. The indicative cost of the Surat and Udhna railway station re-development is Rs 1,285 crores over a four-year timeframe. Surat Multi Model Transport Hub (MMTH) Railway Station work will be carried out by a special purpose vehicle, the Surat Integrated Transportation Development Corporation Limited (SITCO). Incorporated under the Companies Act, 2013, it as a joint venture amongst IRSDC, Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation (GSRTC) and Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) with the approval of railway ministry and Gujarat government. “Proposed amenities in the Surat project include improved connectivity and circulation plan for seamless access and movement, a new east-west road to provide connectivity to the eastern side, a central concourse and walkways as passenger interchange plaza providing seamless interconnectivity to railway platforms, GSRTC terminal, BRTS and city bus terminal, proposed Metro, parking zones, recreational zones and easy signage for passengers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/udhna-station-transformation-plan-on-track/articleshow/86241332.cms||---

Rajan who was out for his regular morning walk was bitten by a stray dog near the office of city police commissioner at Vazhuthacaud on Wednesday morning. He immediately sought medical care in a nearby hospital. “I am recuperating after a surgery and I have been advised to exercise. I went for my usual walk in the morning and a stray dog lying by the footpath bit me below my knee. The wound is not so deep, but I went to the hospital and started taking anti-rabies vaccination,” Rajan said. The instance of a corporation councillor of the ruling council getting bitten by a stray dog is likely to rev up the opposition which has of late been pouncing on the ruling front on every opportunity. The stray dog menace has always been a contentious issue in corporation council meetings. There have been previous instances when joggers would be chased and bitten by stray dogs in different parts of the city. The civic body has recorded 83% and 96% fund utilisation under animal birth control projects in the last two fiscals. Nearly one crore was allotted for the project in two fiscals. The health standing committee which faces heat over waste management of Attukal pongala and awarding of contracts to private agencies for dry waste collection will have another headache as one among their own members has been bitten by a stray dog.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/stray-dog-bites-councillor/articleshow/86243775.cms||---

He was responding to allegations that the BJP deliberately stoked religious issues and targeted a particular community for political gains. Speaking at Navbharat Navnirman Manch- Uttar Pradesh organised by Times Now Navbharat, Singh also reacted to chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s recent ‘Abba Jaan’ jibe, saying that the word otherwise signified “respect” but SP chief Akhilesh Yadav is getting irritated by it because his party does the politics of Muslim appeasement. He reiterated that the former CM Mulayam Singh Yadav ordered firing on Karsewaks for the sake of Muslim appeasement. Stressing that the BJP government did not differentiate between the Hindus and Muslims while giving facilities and making schemes, Singh said that both the community need to come together in taking the state and the country forward. “Today people call themselves ‘Hindustani’ with pride. Even after the Supreme Court gave its nod for Ram Temple in Ayodhya not a single riot took place,” he said, maintaining that even Muslims would not support the Samajwadi Party wholeheartedly in the forthcoming UP assembly elections. “While BSP is stronger than the SP, there is no key political opponent before the BJP,” he said. Singh said that his party was led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the Centre and CM Yogi in UP, who believe in working hard and also making sacrifices for the nation’s sake.“There was no room for nepotism, casteism and regionalism which largely prevails in the SP and the BSP,” he emphasised. Singh claimed that SP and BSP have never come to power on the basis of popularity. “They have just been alternating with each other as people did not have options. Now, they have one,” he said, claiming that not a single person in the state was against PM Modi and CM Yogi as the image of both leaders remains unblemished. On the issue of farmers’ organising a ‘Mahapanchayat’ against the three farm laws, the UP BJP chief said that farmers supported the BJP which got indicated in the recently held panchayat elections where a large number of BJP-backed candidates won. He said that the farmers’ stir was supported and funded by the Congress and other political parties to defame the BJP. Side stepping the query that whether Ram Mandir will be an election issue, Singh said that it was Lord Ram who decided that the foundation stone of his temple will be laid by PM Modi.

Justice PV Kunhikrishnan gave the suggestion after considering a report filed by state police chief stating that it is not legally possible to take action against retired officers if they turn hostile in criminal cases once they leave the service. The court’s suggestion came in a case alleging that counterfeit currency notes worth Rs 75 lakh and printing apparatus were seized from a building in Tripunithura on March 21, 1990. The inspector of crime branch and other police officers who were involved in the case had turned hostile during trial, resulting in the accused being let off on benefit of doubt. Earlier, the court had directed the police chief to conduct an enquiry against the inspector who turned hostile and submit a report. In the report, the police chief said action cannot be taken against retired officers as they do not come under the purview of the Kerala Police Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/consider-changing-law-hc-tells-govt/articleshow/86243729.cms||---
---||Jaipur||1,000 tons of trash litters Jaipur roads as garbage lifters stir over pay delay||JAIPUR: Around 1,500 sanitation workers employed by the garbage collecting company went on strike from Wednesday onwards due to non-payment of salaries for the past two months. In its reply, the company alleged that they could not pay the wages since the civic bodies were not clearing their dues. Around 10 days ago, sanitation workers had organised a big protest at JMC-Heritage headquarters saying they would stop lifting garbage if their wages were not cleared. On Wednesday, around 1,300 tons of garbage wasn’t picked up from Jaipur city. Almost all the city roads were filled with garbage and the situation was likely to turn worse if the issue wasn’t resolved soon. Many councillors of both the corporations have said they were fed up of complaining to officials. They added that if the sanitation workers did not resume work, the city’s condition would worsen. Vicky Umarwal, sanitation worker of the company said, “We have given many ultimatums to the company to clear our bills. Since both the civic bodies have not cleared the bills of the company, they are unable to pay salaries. We want our bills to be cleared or else the strike will continue.” In JMC-Heritage, preparations have begun to clear the bills amounting to Rs 10 crore to the company. While payments for the months of May and June have been cleared, the process to clear the amounts for July and August is under process. JMC-Heritage has called meeting with the garage department to arrange an alternative way to lift trash using their own resources if the workers continue with their strike. JMC-Heritage mayor Munesh Gurjar said they would clear the bills soon and workers will cease their strike from Thursday. “We had a discussion with the revenue department and will try to clear some bills. We are fully equipped to lift garbage from door-to-door until the problem is resolved,” said Gurjar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/1000-tons-of-trash-litters-city-roads-as-garbage-lifters-stir-over-pay-delay/articleshow/86246149.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi Police identify mastermind of terror module||NEW DELHi: Delhi Police’s Special Cell has identified a man named Mohammad Usaidur Rehman as the alleged mastermind of the terror component of the module that was busted on Tuesday. Rehman is supposedly located outside the country and a lookout notice has been issued against him, sources said. Rehman is the father of Mohammad Osama alias Sami who was arrested in the case on Tuesday. Rehman’s brother, Umaidur, is also allegedly a part of the syndicate and has been absconding, police said. Osama (22) lived in Abu Fazal Enclave in Jamia Nagar area of Delhi, while his father was in a middle-eastern country till sometime ago. His present location is not known to the police. The cell has apparently stumbled upon communication, which suggested that Rehman had been in touch with at least two people linked to the ISI who were coordinating with him on behalf of an entity referred to as “Colonel Ghazi”. Ghazi was overseeing the training of recruits from India and had assigned their responsibility to two of his juniors— now identified as Jabbar and Hamza— who were officers of the Pak military. On Ghazi’s instructions, Rehman arranged for his son, Osama, to join the training and asked his brother Umaidur to get another recruit. Umaidur allegedly roped in Zeeshan from Prayagraj into the module after radicalising him. Osama left for Muscat, Oman on April 22, 2021 by Salaam Air flight from Lucknow. After reaching Muscat, Osama was asked to come to a flat where he met Zeeshan. Soon, they were joined by 15-16 Bengali speaking youths. All of them were divided into sub-groups. Zeeshan and Osama were placed in one group. Over the next few days, the recruits made several short sea-journeys, changing boats a number of times. They were taken to a town named Jiwani, which is located near Gwadar port, Pakistan, Delhi Police earlier said in a statement. The group was received by a Pakistani national after reaching Jiwani and they were all taken to a farmhouse in Thatta city, located in Sindh province of Pakistan. This is where Ajmal Amir Kasab had been trained. Osama and Zeeshan have told cops during interrogation that there were three Pakistani nationals in the farmhouse. Two of them, who were introduced as Jabbar and Hamza, imparted training to them. Both of them were from the Pakistan Army and were wearing military uniforms. The recruits were also taken to Karachi, they have revealed. The training lasted for around 15 days during which they were allegedly trained in IED assembly and bomb making apart from ways of carrying out arson using daily use items, police said. They were also trained in the use of small firearms and AK-47s. After the training, the recruits were taken back to Muscat via the same route and then asked to return to their original destination, they added. The underworld component being co-ordinated by Dawood Ibrahim’s brother, Anees, had, meanwhile, arranged for RDX, grenades and weapons that were to be smuggled to India in batches.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/police-identify-mastermind-of-terror-module/articleshow/86243698.cms||Raj Shekhar
---||Delhi||LeT man gets 7-yr jail for plotting attacks across India||New Delhi: The country is relentlessly facing violence on account of terror activities, causing a loss of thousands of innocent lives and destabilisation of the economy, said a Delhi court, while awarding seven years imprisonment to a Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorist from Pakistan for conspiring to carry out terror attacks at different places.Mohammad Amir was convicted for infiltrating into India with advanced weapons and other equipment and conspiring to carry out attacks at different locations.District Judge Dinesh Kumar Sharma said terrorist activity was a cause for concern for the entire humanity and the case involved “extremely serious offence”. He directed that Amir be deported to Pakistan on completion of his sentence.However, the court added that while awarding the sentence, it had to take into account the circumstances affecting the society at large as well as the mitigating factors in favour of the convict. In its order, it said that in its interaction with the convict, the court was informed that his father had expired during this period and his mother was handicapped.“The convict further states that he is only 22-23 years of age and wants to live a normal life. Therefore, he may be awarded minimum punishment so as to enable him to go back to his home and live peacefully. The awarding of the sentence is not an easy task and is a tough call,” said the court, adding that it had to take into account a variety of factors, including the mitigating circumstances, aggravating factors and peculiarity of the case.The court further stated, “The convict is admittedly a Pakistani national and he infiltrated into the territory of this country with advanced weapons and other equipment. He was arrested with advanced weapons and equipment along with communication equipment.”Advocate Kahorngam Zimik, appearing for the convict, argued that the convict was a young boy and was already repenting the mistake committed by him and sought a minimum sentence.National Investigation Agency had sought maximum punishment in view of the extraordinary facts and circumstances of the case. The additional public prosecutor said the convict had infiltrated into India with a motive to destabilise the country and to cause terror activities.According to the chargesheet filed by NIA, a conspiracy was hatched by Lashkar-e-Taiba in Pakistan involving many people who were members of the proscribed organisation. To execute those acts, the convict illegally infiltrated into the soil of this country along with his accomplices. However, the accomplices were gunned down and the convict was apprehended.NIA further stated that the terrorists were equipped with navigation, combat and advanced weapons, communication equipment and their intention was to carry out terrorist attacks in Jammu & Kashmir and at different places in the country. The agency said the convict was arrested during the search operation by J&K Police and Indian Army in November 2017 and was found to be a Pakistani national and a trained cadre of LeT.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/let-man-gets-7-yr-jail-for-plotting-attacks-across-india/articleshow/86243702.cms||Usha Das

With this, 117 school students have tested positive for the virus in the state since the reopening of schools in September 1.On Wednesday alone, 34 school students were tested positive for Covid-19 in the state. Eight of them were from a single school in Tirupur, where a Class X student of Chinnasamy Ammal Higher Secondary School was found to be infected on Tuesday during a random testing that was carried out by the public health staff. Subsequently, swab samples of a few of her schoolmates were taken the same day. When the results arrived on Wednesday, eight of them were found to be infected. “Parents of a student were also tested positive, taking the total number of cases in the cluster to 11,” said an official source.In Coimbatore, a Class XII girl student of St Joseph’s School near Somanur was tested positive for the virus on Wednesday. Swab samples were collected from her contacts on the day itself. The school would remain closed for the next three days, when the classrooms and its premises would be disinfected. At least 11 students have tested positive for Covid-19 in the district so far. In addition, a few teachers have also contracted the virus during the period.In comparison, schools in Madurai haven’t reported any Covid-19 cases after the reopening early this month. While a few students had contracted the virus in Trichy in the past couple of days, there wasn’t any fresh case on the day. T S Selvavinayagam, director of public health and preventive medicine, said the daily caseload was higher in Coimbatore, compared to most of the other districts. “When the virus is present in the community, it is natural for the students to get infected in the schools. And since we are identifying them in the early stages of infection itself through random testing, we are able to contain the spread.” He said if the numbers were to increase beyond a limit, they would take appropriate measures. “As of now, all the reopened schools are being closely monitored.” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/one-student-in-dist-8-in-tirupur-test-positive-for-covid-in-a-day/articleshow/86243741.cms||---

Mahesh Sharma, spokesperson of Federation of Indian Granite and Stone Industry said, “The industry is yet to recover from the slowdown induced by the Coivid pandemic, but the government is unmindful of the difficulties the industry is facing.” He said that the overall impact will be the consumers whose cost of building a house or renovation will be expensive due to the adverse decision the mining department has taken. “We will approach all the relevant authorities to roll back the hike in royalty,” added Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/royalty-hike-on-marble-granite-upsets-industry/articleshow/86246168.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||South, North RTOs hit top gear||Coimbatore: The regional transport offices (RTO) in Coimbatore South and North are among the top five RTOs in the state in terms of the number of vehicle registration. While Coimbatore South RTO is placed second, the other one is ranked third in this area. At fourth, Coimbatore North RTO is also among the top five RTOs in the state in terms of revenue generation.These two are the only RTOs outside Chennai to be featured among the top five, according to the data available with the parivahan website.Officials with these RTOs are surprised at the rankings. One of them said the ranking might be based on the past data and the RTOs in Chennai were performing far better than the ones in the city in the current scenario. Till 2009, the official said, the city had only two RTOs - Coimbatore South and North - against the four presently. Among the four RTOs in the city, the one in North recorded the highest vehicle registration of 1.29 lakh from January 2017 to September 1, 2021, followed by the one in Central (1.12 lakh) South (99,444) and West (97, 888).In terms of revenue collection, Central RTO outperformed the other three by collecting Rs 389 crore during the period. It was followed by North RTO (Rs 377 crore), South (Rs 362 crore) and West (Rs 242 crore).Pollachi RTO had registered 67,246 vehicles and collected Rs 206 crore during the period, while Mettupalayam RTO registered 53,939 vehicles and collected Rs 133 crore.An official with the transport department said the number of vehicles registered and revenues collected would depend on the size of area under each RTO and buying capacity of the people there.The official said the Central RTO had outperformed other RTOs in revenue collection as it housed posh and vast areas such as Race Course, Lakshmi Mills, Gandhipuram, RS Puram, Ganapathy, Singanallur on Trichy Road and PSG Tech on Avinashi Road.“The RTO used to generate Rs 80-Rs 90 crore revenue annually during the pre-Covid times. Revenue fell to around Rs 64 crore in 2020, a drop of 24% from the 2019 figures. The RTO has collected around Rs 55 crore revenue so far this year. Our target is Rs 100 crore revenue,” the official said.Pointing out that new vehicle registrations and road taxes were major revenue sources for the transport department, the official said fees for licences and other services formed only a minor share of the revenue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/south-north-rtos-hit-top-gear/articleshow/86243752.cms||V Devanathan

Of the 12 students of different schools, 10 were girls who topped the exam and were seen enthusiastic to get honoured from khap leaders for the first time at khap spot. The khap leaders addressed from the stage vowed to bring a change in girls’ lives by educating and supporting them according to their wish. Teachers of schools that took part in the event were honoured as well. Haryana’s khaps were known for imposing limitations on girls and even named for honour killings due to inter-caste marriages and other issues. Talking to TOI, Om Parkash Kandela, (72) khap head who graduated in 1974, said time has come to change the mindset of the khap. “The education system has collapsed which can’t be gauged in the last two years due to Covid-19 outbreak and needs to be rejuvenated. Students have left studying and sat idle at home and such a situation will ruin the future of students. Now, khap will not be known for only their diktats but for their step toward improving society. Khap will keep a tab on schools and their way of teaching as well as their children to bring a positive change and consistent efforts will be made,” he added. Khap general secretary Raj Singh Kandela said, “We have empowered farmer’s agitation, but now focused to take our children ahead to build a better future. It is worrisome as steps should have been taken by the Haryana government to improve the education system that collapsed in the Corona outbreak but khap took this as a challenge for the nation’s future. The state government has nothing to do with improving the education system and sports system as their preference looks very different. We are always known as a land of agitation due to political vested interest. But now, society is coming forward to take steps for a better future.” Sub-divisional magistrate Rajesh Khoth of Uchana Kalan said, ‘I have asked khap leaders to make students visit historical places, science institutes, and best educational institutes as well as famous places to get an exposure. The khap panchayat’s decision would b e a milestone in future for a major change in the lifestyle of rural students.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/kandela-khap-decides-to-encourage-girls-to-focus-more-on-education/articleshow/86246208.cms||---

However, compared to 2019, there was a dip in the number of crimes involving children in conflict with the law (CCLs). In 2019, 2,783 such cases were committed and 3,256 juveniles apprehended. Among 19 metropolitan cities, Delhi ranked number one in terms of juvenile crimes, followed by Chennai (773 cases) and Ahmedabad (483 cases). The data shows juveniles were involved in various crimes, including 57 murders, 79 rapes, 64 under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 87 assaults on women with intent to outrage her modesty, 77 attempts to murder, 33 attempts to commit culpable homicide and 22 kidnappings and abductions. Juveniles were mostly involved in street crimes. “They committed 1,141 thefts, 267 robberies and 102 burglaries,” NCRB states. According to a Child Welfare Committee (CWC) official, children, mostly from economically weak backgrounds, are brainwashed by criminals on the pretext of easy money. As per the data, juveniles were also found involved in 43 cases under Excise Act, 29 Arms Act cases, 173 hurt and 31 rash driving cases. “Last year, 95.2% of the CCLs were found guilty,” the data shows. According to NCRB, 406 minors were illiterate, 995 studied up to the primary, 1,264 completed matriculation, 238 studied till higher secondary and 36 had gone beyond higher secondary. Vaidehi Subramani, chairperson of CWC at South Delhi district, said, “Lack of love, troubled home, drugs, poverty, unemployment, friendship with bad elements lead to juvenile delinquency.” Truthful engagement of children in house and society, including enrolment in schools, can help in solving this problem, she added. “When a minor is apprehended for the first time, proper intervention is needed so that s/he does not commit any crime in future.” According to NCRB, 2,396 CCLs were staying with their families, 289 with guardians and 255 homeless. Yashwant Jain, a member National Commission for Protection of Child Rights, said environmental factors such as disorganised neighbourhoods contributed to such crimes. “Vocational courses at observation homes can help in addressing this,” he said. A Delhi Police officer said they had launched a Yuva scheme to impart job-oriented skills to vulnerable youngsters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/offences-by-minors-down-but-delhi-still-leads-most-big-cities/articleshow/86243797.cms||Abhay Singh

Kumar said, “Our attempt is to destroy the confiscated contraband under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act as soon as possible.

The examination is scheduled to be held on September 18. Five days before the examination, he received an online admit card with a college in Jammu mentioned as the examination centre. According to Shiwankar, he had never selected Jammu while filling centre preferences. Shiwankar said three of his friends too have been allotted the same college in Jammu, which is 2,000km from his place. More than 2,000 graduates of ayurveda, unani, siddha, and homeopathy streams from Maharashtra, who are set to appear in this entrance test for admission to their desired post graduate courses, received similar shockers on September 13. In a late night development, some of these candidates were allotted centres in Maharashtra and issued updated I-cards. “Students from Nagpur and Akola were allotted colleges in Bhopal as examination centre. Candidates in Mumbai and Kolhapur were allotted colleges in Ahmedabad. That too just four days prior to their examination,” said Dr Shubham Bobde whose centre is IES University, Bhopal, despite Maharashtra having designated centres in Akola, Chandrapur, Kolhapur, Mumbai, Navi Mumbai, Nagpur, Nashik and Pune. Dr Vishnu Bawane, national coordinator of the National Integrated Medical Association (NIMA), termed it as atrocious move against doctors who have worked tirelessly during the Covid times. “Is it possible to reach Jammu by train amid the pandemic condition at such a short notice? There is a flood situation in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. We continously requested the National Testing Agency (NTA) to change the exam venues immediately,” said Dr Bawane. Sources in NTA told TOI that they are conducting AIAPGET since 2019 on behalf of Ministry of AYUSH with the approval of the Ministry of Education while the state government is the facilitating authority. “We have been told that the Maharashtra government is conducting some entrance test on the same date and hence centres are not available. So, NTA was left with no option but to adjust the candidates in other states,” said the sources. As per the MahaCET website, Common Entrance Tests (CETS- 2021) for professional courses in academic year 2021-22 are being conducted in the state from September 15. CETs for Master of Physical Education and Master in Business Administration & Management Studies are to be conducted on September 18. Collectively, more than two lakh candidates will appear for these exams. Dr Rahul Raut, state secretary of NIMA students forum, said that all are demanding allotment of centres according to preferences given. “There may be mismanagement or lack of coordination between state and NTA, but ultimately it’s the Ayush doctors who are suffering,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ayush-pg-entrance-maha-candidates-get-bhopal-ahmedabad-jammu-as-centres/articleshow/86241499.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

---||Ahmedabad||Crime in Gujarat doubled in lockdown year: NCRB||AHMEDABAD: In 2020, with the Covid pandemic hitting and subsequent lockdown, criminal cases in Gujarat doubled to 3.81 lakh cases under the Indian Penal Code (IPC), in comparison with the year 2019 where 1.39 lakh cases were reported. According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) figures, Gujarat has the highest charge sheeting rate at 97.1% in the year 2020 which is the highest among states and Union Territories across the country. Senior police officers said criminal offences spiked in 2020 due to strict police action during the lockdown between March and June and later during night curfews. “Apart from regular criminal offences under the IPC, the year that Covid hit witnessed the maximum cases under IPC Sections 188 (disobedience to the duly promulgated notification issued by a government servant), 269 (negligent or unlawful act likely to spread dangerous disease) and 270 (malignant act likely to spread dangerous disease),” said the officer, adding that these additional cases relating to Covid had increased the number of FIRs in the state. According to NCRB data, there were around 2.27 lakh cases just under IPC Section 188 (violation of notification issued by public servant), which means that other cases under the IPC were not as numerous compared to previous years. Apart from this, the number of murder cases was 982 in 2020, a slight decline from 993 cases in 2019. The number of attempted murder cases increased from 910 in 2019 to 933 in 2033, pointing to greater conflict among people during the Covid year, said a police officer. In road-related cases, hit-and-run offences increased from 966 in 2019 to 1,022 in 2020. Police attributed this to the Covid-19 pandemic as vehicular movement was restricted for most of the time, which increased incidents of speeding and simultaneous rushing against deadlines. In crimes against women, stalking and voyeurism offences increased according to the NCRB data.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/crime-in-gujarat-doubled-in-lockdown-year-ncrb/articleshow/86243901.cms||---

He also conveyed felicitations and best wishes to all ranks, veterans, civilian employees, and families of the command. The command, raised in 1947 with headquarters at Delhi, was mandated to control formations with an operational role in territorial areas of the present Western and Northern Armies. It was redesignated Western Command in January 1948. In 1954, the headquarters of the command moved to Shimla. After the 1971 Indo-Pak War, Northern Command, with its headquarters at Udhampur, was carved out of Western Command to assume operational responsibility of Jammu and Kashmir. Later, headquarters of Western Command moved to its present location at Chandimandir in Panchkula in 1985. The Western Army has a glorious history of valour and dedication in playing a stellar role in preserving the territorial integrity of the nation. It was instrumental in effectively blunting the Pakistani aggression in 1947, 1965 and 1971, and subsequently carrying the battle into enemy territory. Its troops, formations and units have always distinguished themselves, winning a large number of gallantry awards including Param Vir Chakras.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/74th-raising-day-of-armys-western-command-celebrated-at-chandimandir/articleshow/86246245.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: No development, BJP only re-inaugurated, renamed SP government’s projects, says Akhilesh Yadav||LUCKNOW: Accusing the BJP of having failed to fulfil any of the promises made in its Sankalp Patra (manifesto) for 2017 elections, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Wednesday challenged the Yogi government to name a single development project it started and completed in four-and-a-half year rule. Yogi regime has only renamed and re-inaugurated the projects launched by my government, Akhilesh said. Speaking at Navbharat Navnirman Manch-Uttar Pradesh organised by Times Now Navbharat, a combative Akhilesh attacked the BJP on several fronts. Suggesting that the party should open an institute to impart training in lying before the people and spreading falsehood, Akhilesh said the BJP is losing its sheen as the UP government has dumped its party’s manifesto. Akhilesh said CM Yogi Adityanath had visited Jhansi soon after coming to power and announced that an expressway would be built connecting Jhansi with Delhi. He had also promised to introduce Metro trains in Jhansi and Gorakhpur at par with those in Delhi and big cities. “What happened to the Metro in Jhansi and Gorakhpur? the SP chief asked. Akhikesh demanded the Yogi government to release a list of projects initiated by it. “In the Sankalp Patra, they (BJP) had promised to double the income of farmers,” he said, adding that on the contrary things have turned worse for farmers. Pointing out that new airports have come up and another 17 are nearing completion, Akhilesh said all these projects were being completed to be sold off to private players. He cited the example of Chitrakoot, Azamgarh and Kushinagar airstrips, which were constructed during Mulayam Singh Yadav’s regime and expanded during the previous SP government but they were abandoned by the Yogi government. “Sankalp Patra talked about 70 lakh jobs. People didn’t get jobs but youth, including Dalits and backward classes, were cane-charged in Lucknow when they staged a protest demanding reservation in jobs,” Akhilesh said. Accusing the government of having done nothing to improve the medical infrastructure in the state, Akhilesh said it was this apathy that claimed many lives during Covid pandemic. The session had some lighter moments too. Responding to a query on the impact of Asaduddin Owaisi’s attempts to enter UP’s electoral politics in a big way on the M-Y (Muslim-Yadav) combination that usually dominates SP’s vote bank, Akhilesh said this time M-Y will stand for Mahila (women) and Youth who will vote SP to form the government. Taking exception to SP becoming a “new party” under him as compared to the one headed by Mulayam Singh Yadav, he said the party will incorporate the experience of the SP patriarch while taking a new path. Asked about the party’s stand on SP MP Shafeequr Rehman Barq’s remarks describing Taliban as freedom fighters of Afghanistan, Akhilesh said it was not the party’s official stand. ‘Not my sanskar to reply to ‘abba jaan’ jibe’Responding to UP CM’s ‘abba jaan’ jibe, which is seen as an attack on SP, Akhilesh Yadav said his upbringing does not permit him to match such a language. “ Woh Yogiji ke sanskar hain. Hum to aur bhi kuch keh sakte hain lekin Netaji (Mulayam) ne hum logon ko aise sanskar nahi diye ki hum aisi bhasha ka istimaal karen(Those words reflect Yogiji’s upbringing. I can use harsher words but Netaji’s upbringing does not allow us to use such a language),” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/no-devpt-bjp-only-re-inaugurated-renamed-sp-govts-projects-akhilesh/articleshow/86247430.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

---||Delhi||2nd suspect arrested in J&K ex-MLC’s murder case||New Delhi: Delhi Police on Wednesday arrested another man in connection with the murder of Trilochan Singh Wazir, former member of Jammu and Kashmir legislative council. Wazir (67) was found dead at a flat in west Delhi’s Basai Darapur area earlier this month. This is the second arrest in the murder. The arrested man has been identified as 67-year-old Balbir Singh alias Billa, a resident of Preet Nagar, Jammu. He was nabbed in Jammu and brought to Delhi. Raju, who was arrested earlier, told cops that Wazir was given sedatives to make him unconscious soon after which he was shot dead. “Both Raju and Billa were produced in a court and have been taken on seven days police remand during which they will be questioned to unearth the whole conspiracy behind the murder. It was requested in the court that they are required to be taken to Punjab and Jammu for search of absconding accused, for the recovery of murder weapon and for recovery of clothes worn at the time of incident,” said a senior police officer from the crime branch. Initial questioning revealed that Billa had come to Delhi on September 3 and returned to Jammu in the morning of September 4. Police found that while Billa had earlier worked with the horticulture department as well as bus and truck unions in Jammu, he was presently jobless. “His son is working as a salesman. Both his daughters are married and his two sisters are settled abroad,” said an officer. Two main suspects are still absconding. They have been identified as Harpeet and Harmeet. According to the probe so far, police said Harpreet's uncle was killed in 1983 and he suspected Wazir’s hand behind the killing. Earlier, the crime branch of Delhi Police had identified 34-year old Harmeet as the prime suspect because he was apprehensive that he had a threat to life.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/2nd-suspect-arrested-in-jk-ex-mlcs-murder-case/articleshow/86243846.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The panchayat took to scientific garbage management in 2018 in accordance with government norms through the ‘haritha karma sena.’ The karma sena collects non-biodegradable waste from homes and businesses and transports it to recycling shredding units. The waste being collected is sorted into different categories based on its characteristics. According to the mission, the Clean Kerala Company distributes shredded plastic to local governments for road tarring. The collection will be done on the basis of a user fee. At first, the houses had to give Rs 20 and the shops had to give Rs 50, but now it has changed and the houses have to give Rs 50 and shops are charged Rs 100. This amount is provided to the haritha karma sena workers as part of their wages. As part of it the panchayat has established MCF (material collection facility) across wards and have also placed mini MCF boxes in every ward of the panchayat as well as in markets and hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/poovachal-bags-nava-kerala-award/articleshow/86243832.cms||---

An FIR was filed at Kho Nagoriyan police station on Tuesday through a court complaint. The victim, Rakesh Kumar, alleged in his FIR that he worked at a private nursing home where he met two accused who offered a guaranteed selection in a railway group D recruitment. On August 5 last year, the accused sent a letter for medical examination in New Delhi and took Rs 3 lakh for the process. A few days later on September 24, the accused told Rakesh that the latter will have to shell out Rs 2 lakh for police verification. Rakesh got his job letter in February in which he was asked to join services in Dhanbad. When he found out that there was no such vacancy, he called up the accused. The accused refused to return the money following which he filed an FIR at the Kho Nagoriyan police station through a court complaint. Police said a case was registered and an investigation was underway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/man-spends-rs-9-5l-for-railway-job-gets-fake-appointment-letter/articleshow/86246251.cms||---

The state’s power consumption grew by 20.5%. The national average increase in consumption during the same period is about 18%. While the highest one-day demand in August this year was 11,018 MW on August 28, the state consumed 8,892 MW on August 30, 2020. State energy secretary Srikant Nagulapalli said the increase in energy demand points to improved economic activity in Andhra Pradesh compared to last year. “This could be a good sign for the development of the state. In fact, the national average energy consumption grew by 19% in the first fortnight of May 2021, while it was only 15.37 % for Andhra Pradesh. However, the state’s energy consumption surpassed national average in August,” said Srikant. Srikant added despite severe financial constraints, the utilities will take it as a challenge and strive hard to make the sector self-sufficient. “For the last two-and-a-half years, the energy department achieved several major milestones in the sector. The utilities have implemented cost-effective measures in power purchases and improved the infrastructure by the erection of new power lines, transformers, substations, etc. All these measures have helped in the reduction of interruptions in power supply,” said Srikant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/power-use-up-by-20-as-economy-recovers/articleshow/86243829.cms||---
---||Kolkata||24 hrs on, city pockets still under water due to poor drainage, overflowing canal||Kolkata: Though storm water receded from large parts of the city, which were inundated on Tuesday after spells of heavy rain, some pockets remained waterlogged till Wednesday night because of a poor drainage network. KMC sewerage and drainage department officials conceded that water could not be drained out of low-lying areas, including Behala, Kidderpore, large areas off EM Bypass and some stretches in Golf Green-Lake Gardens. The Shakuntala Park-Sarsuna belt in Behala was one of the affected areas, where residents had to wade through knee-deep water even on Wednesday morning. App cabs refused to enter the flooded areas. Avijit Ghosh, a resident of Sarsuna, said all drivers refused his bookings. “I had to visit a private hospital off EM Bypass. Having failed to convince app cab drivers about my urgency to hire a taxi, I cancelled the appointment,” said Ghosh. Residents of a government housing complex at Charu Chandra Place (east) also found it difficult to resume their daily routine even on Wednesday after being confined to their homes the whole of Tuesday. Senior citizen Suchitra Pal, a resident, said she could not even go to the market. In several areas in Ekbalpore-Kidderpore, water did not recede till late on Wednesday afternoon. Similarly, residents in areas off EM Bypass, including Mukundapur, Madurdaha and Patuli, were also watered in. According to a KMC drainage department official, the civic body had to struggle to flush out storm water from several Behala and EM Bypass areas due to a poor drainage network. “We used portable pumps to flush out water from low-lying areas, where we don’t have a fool-proof drainage network,” said a KMC official. Several parts of New Town, largely in Action Area II, and adjacent Rajarhat areas remained under water till Wednesday afternoon due to the overflowing canal. NKDA workers spent much of Wednesday, clearing drainage outlets. “The roads in front of our complex went under water and the level did not change even 24 hours after the downpour. Water from the adjacent Rajarhat main road area, was pumped into this area,” said Kingshuk Chakraborty, a resident of Greenfield Ambition. Residents also said household waste thrown by the roads blocked the gullypits and choked the pipes. “Waste from roadside stalls are dumped in drains, which get clogged and cause waterlogging,” said Bijoy Das of Akansha complex.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/24-hrs-on-city-pockets-still-under-water-due-to-poor-drainage-overflowing-canal/articleshow/86243845.cms||Saikat Ray

However, of the total cases, about two-thirds involved minors. In Surat city, six cases of rape of SC/ST women were reported and all the victims were minors. The NCRB data reveals that of the 19 major cities in the country most cases of rape of SC/ST children were in Ahmedabad city which reported 12 incidents. Ahmedabad was followed by Bengaluru and Lucknow (10 cases each), Hyderabad (7), and Indore and Surat (6). Jignesh Mevani, a Dalit leader and Vadgam MLA, said: “Child abuse is common in our society and what we have realized, and what studies have proved, is that such abuse comes from within the family.” He added: “There are several research studies on atrocities, but political parties have failed to act. Dalit women and children are more vulnerable than ever not only to rape but also to all kinds of atrocities.” A senior police official said that the elopement of minor girls is high in the age group of 15 to 18 and in such cases the section of rape is added along with Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) provisions. However, this is common across all sections of society, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/rape-of-sc/st-children-city-worst-among-19-major-metros/articleshow/86243898.cms||---

One thing is for sure: people of UP want a change (of government),” he said. Citing the example of the party’s recently launched Tiranga Yatra, Singh added: “Public interaction has gone up to another level and our observation is that public sentiment against the ruling BJP has deepened.” Singh said that in wake of the public sentiment, AAP is emphatically positioning itself as an alternative to the people. “Unlike other parties which thrive on claims, we have tangible work to show and make people understand. We will field good candidates on all the 403 seats and put our best foot forward,” he said. Asked if development plank was their strength then why was AAP talking about caste politics, Singh said: “If someone is being targeted because of their caste, we will have to raise their plight.” Asked to comment on what makes AAP a better option than other parties, he said: “We do not believe in divisive politics. We took the name of Ram only because we believe in tenets of Ram Rajya. We have worked to turn the dream of Ram Rajya into reality to a great extent and in UP we will do the same.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/aap-has-turned-the-dream-of-ram-rajya-into-reality/articleshow/86247449.cms||Shailvee Sharda

---||Ahmedabad||3 turncoats get berths too||Ahmedabad: In an attempt to placate senior leaders who defected from the Congress to the BJP over the last few years, three ‘turncoat leaders’ have been inducted into the new cabinet that was sworn in on Thursday under the leadership of chief minister Bhupendra Patel. This is exactly equal to the number of ex-Congress leaders who had joined the BJP and were made ministers in the outgoing Vijay Rupani government, whose supporters have been vociferous in opposing the sweeping change in the cabinet. Raghavji Patel, the six-time MLA from Jamnagar (rural), joined the BJP in 2017, after being expelled from the Congress for voting against Ahmed Patel in the Rajya Sabha elections. Patel has been made cabinet-rank minister for agriculture, animal husbandry, and cow welfare. He is among the few ministers in the new cabinet who has ministerial experience, having served in the Shankersinh Vaghela government in the nineties. Brijesh Merja, the MLA from Morbi, and Jitu Chaudhary, the Kaprada MLA, were also sworn-in as ministers. The two joined the BJP after resigning from the Congress in 2020. The ruling party, which has adopted ‘no repeat’ formulation for its cabinet, dropped former Congress leaders Kunvarji Bavaliya, Dharmendrasinh Jadeja and Jawahar Chavda from the council of ministers. Bavaliya’s supporters had earlier raised slogans seeking the senior leader’ inclusion in the new cabinet. Bavaliya, a five-term MLA from Jasdan in Rajkot district, earned the sobriquet of the ‘fastest minister’ after he was administered the oath of office as cabinet minister within five hours of quitting the Congress in July 2018. He was rewarded with cabinet rank and given key portfolios of water supply, animal husbandry, and rural housing. An influential Koli leader, he won the Jasdan bypolls by an impressive margin of more than 19,000 votes. “Hu kam karto vyakti chhu. Hu game teni sathe adjust thai shaku em chhu. (I am a man of action. I can adjust with anybody),” Bavaliya had said at the time of joining the BJP. Like Bavaliya, Dharmendrasinh Jadeja, the MLA from Jamnagar North, crossed over from Congress to BJP and was appointed minister of state for civil supplies in March 2019. Popularly known as ‘Hakubha’, Jadeja was one of the eight Congress MLAs who had been expelled from the Congress for cross-voting in the high-stakes 2017 Rajya Sabha elections where senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel won in a photo-finish despite cross-voting by Congress legislators. Former Congress leader Jawahar Chavda had switched to the BJP in 2019 and was made a minister on the day after he resigned as Congress MLA. He had won the Manavadar assembly seat bypolls by over 9,000 votes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/3-turncoats-get-berths-too/articleshow/86272718.cms||---

The plots – in sectors 105 (seven acres) and 124 (nine acres) – had been transferred to Logix subsidiaries in June 2010 and December 2010. The group was to develop a retail unit – mall and multiplex – and office space in Sector 105 and had similar plans for Sector 124 with a limited number of residential suites. Officials said the group failed to pay up its instalments along with compound interest to the Noida Authority. For the Sector 124 plot, the Noida Authority claims its dues amount to Rs 796 crore while for the Sector 105 plot, it is yet to receive Rs 588 crore. Kumar Sanjay, officer on special duty at the Noida Authority who heads the commercial division, said Logix Group subsidiaries were given a lot of time to come to the table and pay up the dues. “But we decided to cancel the allotment as we got no concrete response from them,” he said. Both plots lie close to the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway. No construction work has taken place at the sites. TOI got in touch with Vikram Nath, a director of the Logix group, but he declined to comment. The decision to cancel the allotments made to the Logix group is the latest in a series of similar measures Noida has taken this year. Over the past few months, the Noida Authority has acted against more than 22 allottees for dues that it claims amount to more than Rs 7,500 crore. The biggest of these was in April when prime commercial land Sector 32 was taken back from the Wave group. The Noida Authority has also issued recovery certificates to four other companies, among them the Supertech group (Rs 27 crore). The three other companies are MMR Saha Infrastructure Pvt Ltd for land allotted in Sector 52 for which Noida claims it has to recover Rs 869 crore, Granite Hills Properties Ltd for its property in Sector 98 (Rs 350 crore) and ET Infra Developers Pvt Ltd for a plot in Sector 16 (Rs 63 crore).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/dues-mount-noida-to-cancel-allotment-of-2-plots-off-e-way-to-logix-group/articleshow/86246301.cms||Shalabh

Speaking in the session ‘Sa Se Sur, Samaj Aur Siyasat’, she said: “After the UP government’s decision to develop a film city, many artists have expressed the desire to return to their native state. One of them is kathak legend Birju Maharaj who says that though he lives in Delhi, his heart beats for Lucknow. Classical singer Ustad Rashid Khan, who is based in Kolkata, too wants to come back and train musicians of the Badaun Sahaswan Gharana which is his home.” Adding that the wish of the two maestros has been conveyed to UP CM, she said: “The 25-year-old political instability before the arrival of the Yogi government de-stabilised many of these music schools. Now that the efforts to restore and revive the legacy are being made, the turnaround has begun and in a few years from now one will be able to say that UP was the nerve centre of all cultural legacy… rather each one will proudly say it is.” Bhajan singer Anup Jalota backed Awasthi’s view. “Anyone touched by the raw pleasures of being in Lucknow or any part of UP cannot undo the experience. They may go to any place or achieve anything, their heart would yearn to come back to the roots.” Yoga guru Baba Ramdev, who joined the session virtually, said nation cannot progress unless both the government and the opposition work together.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/music-reclaiming-its-past-glory-in-up-under-yogi-govt/articleshow/86247487.cms||Shailvee Sharda

Braving challenging circumstances and disability Krishnakumari, a polio patient and her sister Manjusha now serve as teachers at government schools in the city. The achievement is the result of their years of toil and hard work. They prepared for PSC exams and cleared it in their 40s. The two sisters, who used to take tuition classes for children, are becoming an inspiration for many kids in Chenkalchoola. Suku, their father, who worked as a phone mechanic at BSNL, retired six years ago. He now runs a tea shop, and their mother passed away 12 years ago. They applied for the exam in 2012 and took the exam in 2017. They received their appointment letters at various dates, but joined work on the same date on July 15. Manjusha now teaches mathematics in the lower primary section at Chalai School and Krishnakumari teaches social science in the upper primary section at Jagathy School. “I was not able to walk till age four, so my mother carried me to my school and everywhere. I was able to start walking only after my surgery. Even then I cannot walk long distances and my sister helped me in studying by sharing her notes with me. We studied together and secured the job. We had to deal with not so ideal circumstances for studying,” said Krishnakumari. “Government Women’s College, where we studied, was a source of inspiration for us. Our parents were completely supportive of our academic pursuit. They wished for us to get a decent job and a good education. Our mother, who is not with us now, was unable to study yet she was able to provide us with a good education," said Krishnakumari. Manjusha said a government job was always their dream. “We have always dreamt about a government job. We have not expected anything but with God's grace we have gained it. We started our job together. We are the first people in this colony to secure a government job in the teaching sector” said Manjusha “There are many children here who share our dreams. They study really well. We try to guide them in whatever way we can whenever they come to us,” Manjusha added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/rajaji-nagar-sisters-land-their-dream-teaching-jobs/articleshow/86243942.cms||---

Given its rich historical links with India, the landlocked country is reaching out to investors in the country and Rajasthan. The three-day road show in Jaipur that starts from Thursday by the Uganda High Commission in the country will focus on improving bilateral trade, commerce and investment, said a senior official of the commission here on Wednesday. Mohammad Kajala, deputy High Commissioner in India, said, “The potential sectors include oil and gas, infrastructure, agriculture, food processing, dairy, mines and minerals, healthcare, education, skill development, tourism, film making, information & communication technology.” Digvijay Dhabriya, chairman of PHD Chamber of Commerce-Rajasthan, which is organizing the roadshow, said that at present the total exports from India to Uganda is $800 million as against meager import of $47 million resulting in a very adverse balance of trade for which both the countries are committed to improve. Dhabriya said that senior ministers from the government of Uganda and India will be interacting with the business community in Rajasthan to give a fillip to the bilateral investment and trade.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/uganda-seeks-investments-from-raj-biz-community/articleshow/86246368.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi govt moves SC over GNCTD Act giving greater powers to LG||NEW DELHI: Delhi government has moved Supreme Court seeking quashing of the four amended sections of Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (GNCTD) Act, which give greater powers to the lieutenant governor. In its petition, the government has contended that the amended sections “diminish the constitutionally guaranteed powers and functions of the elected legislative assembly and council of ministers, overturn the constitutionally stipulated balance between Delhi government and the Union government, and overrule the judgment of the Constitution Bench of Supreme Court in Government of NCT of Delhi v Union of India, (2018)”. It has challenged the constitutionality of the four sections of GNCTD Act, 1991, and many rules of Transaction of Business of Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi Rules, 1993. Aam Aadmi Party had opposed the proposed amendments, which were passed in March, on the ground that it gave greater power to the LG. It said Delhi government would have to seek his permission before taking any executive action. In its plea, Delhi government stated that the amendments by the Centre were an attempt to treat the LG as the “default administering authority over the NCT of Delhi” by equating his position with that of the “government”. The amendments authorised the LG to withhold consent from Bills that, in his judgment, may be “incidentally” outside the scope of the legislative assembly’s powers. This empowered the LG to “interfere in the day-to-day administration of Delhi government by introducing the requirement of obtaining his views before executing a decision of the council of ministers”. The petition further stated that the amendments “encroached” upon the scope of Delhi legislative assembly’s core functions by interfering with the power to frame its own rules of business or to hold the government to account. “The provisions inserted by the amendment Act violate the principles of federalism, separation of powers, representative democracy, and the rule of law, which are essential features of the Constitution. Therefore, the amendment Act violates the basic structure of the Constitution,” added the petition. Delhi government strongly contended the transaction of business rules and said they diluted and divested the executive powers of the elected government by transferring the powers to the LG and the secretaries in derogation of the representative form of government as envisaged under Article 239-AA of the Constitution of India. It sought from the court a direction, order or writ declaring and quashing sections 21, 24, 33, 44 of GNCTD Act, 1991 as unconstitutional and ultra vires the Constitution. It further sought that the court pass a direction, order or writ declaring and quashing amended rules 3, 6A, 10, 14, 15, 19, 22, 23, 25, 47A, 49, 52 and 57 of Transaction of Business of Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi Rules, 1993.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-govt-moves-sc-over-gnctd-act-giving-greater-powers-to-lg/articleshow/86244057.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Lucknow||‘Need for higher representation of women in parties, fair chances’||Lucknow: The BJP government will give more election tickets to women in the upcoming state elections than it did in the last, minister for women and child welfare Swati Singh announced at the Navbharat Navnirman Manch - Uttar Pradesh organised by Times Now Navbharat in Lucknow on Wednesday. Along with Opposition leaders Juhie Singh from Samajwadi Party, Fauzia Rana and Rae Bareli MLA Aditi Singh from Congress, Singh was part of an all-women’s panel speaking on the scope of women in the Indian political system. Despite different political ideologies, the four panelists reached a census on representation of women in politics. They said that Indian politics needs more women both in parties and during elections. Juhie and Aditi went a step further when they said that giving election tickets to women should not mean giving them seats with no prospect of winning. They should get a fair chance to win after putting up a brave fight on their own capabilities, they said. “BJP has the maximum women representation. Under BJP, 54% women got elected as gram pradhan and 52% got elected as zila panchayat heads and block pramukhs. When I sit in the Assembly, I see only a handful of women representatives from other parties. Their visibility should see a rise in other political parties too,” said Swati. Juhie added, “Women are not silent members any more, they are vocal and they should use this voice themselves too to get tickets. They should get the opportunity to have a fair fight and not be given the burden of a ‘haari hui seat’ (seat already lost).” Aditi defends BJP govt Fauzia, the daughter of poet Munawwar Rana, representing Congress, contested that UP is not on the route to becoming Uttam Pradesh but ‘Utpeedan Pradesh’ (exploitation state). “It is not about 5-10% representation of women in politics. We need to see how women are treated in the state. The government is driven by slogans but on ground, rape survivors are self-immolating after disappointment at the hands of the state and bureaucracy,” she said. Aditi, however, countered this argument and said that the BJP-led state government is doing good work for women and during Covid. “Recent data from National Crime Records Bureau states that crime against women registered in UP has gone down by 10,000 cases as compared to last year. The Covid pandemic was also well handled by the government and free ration is also being given to people,” she claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/need-for-higher-representation-of-women-in-parties-fair-chances/articleshow/86247501.cms||Yusra Husain

---||Jaipur||Booze shop owners prepare to surrender licences citing huge losses for months||JAIPUR: Expressing helplessness to survive in the liquor trade due to stricter rules, many shopkeepers are preparing to surrender their licences. The excise department faced a jolt recently after licenses of around 25 liquor shops, including eight run by the Rajasthan State Beverages Corporation Ltd. (RSBCL), were surrendered. Now, more are planning to shut shops forever after suffering losses. Raj Liquor Welfare Society president Nilesh Mewara said, “There are 50 more shopkeepers who are likely to surrender their licences as survival in the trade has become difficult due to the existing policy. In many regions the shopkeepers are facing huge losses.” A source said the Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation (RTDC) in Jaipur is also planning to surrender three shops in Jaipur district as they are not financially viable. As number of shops increased in the state, it is claimed the profit sharing reduced. Moreover, the traders are allegedly facing difficulties due to guarantee system. A society member demanded that the excise department should provide various relaxations for traders to survive in the business. “It’s mandatory for a trader to purchase fixed amount of liquor every month from excise depot. A penalty is imposed, if traders fail. After shops were made composite, the traders must buy stock of Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL), country-made liquor including Rajasthan-Made Liquor (RML). It’s difficult for the shopkeepers to sell the stock of all three categories,” he said. The traders are also apprehensive about the introduction of Point of Sale (POS) machine system. On the lines of ration shop, now liquor contractors will also have to send stock and sales reports to the government online every day. It will also be necessary to pay the bill of sale of each bottle of liquor to the buyer. The excise department, Rajasthan has issued an order directing all the contractors to start this system. While, the department claimed the main reason for starting this system is to stop the illegal sale of spurious and Haryana made liquor, the traders believe it will be an unnecessary burden. “The liquor contractors will have to upload the information about their daily sales and the remaining stock on the IEMS portal of the excise department. Also, the liquor contractor through the POS machine will also have to send the sale details. It will be unnecessary pressure on the traders. If the government wants to impose POS system then it should abolish guarantee system,” said another trader. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/booze-shop-owners-prepare-to-surrender-licences-citing-huge-losses-for-months/articleshow/86246395.cms||---

Rights panel ordered the taluk supply officer, Kollam, to issue the card to T Prasobhana Amma, of Thazham. The taluk supply officer had declined to issue a BPL card on the basis that the total area of the house is over 1000 sq ft. But the complainant said the house and land had already been transferred to their son. However, the SHRC evaluated that Prasobhana Amma’s husband could not work and had no livelihood. As her husband is undergoing dialysis he can get free treatment only if he could produce a BPL card, the commission noted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/family-of-amputee-to-get-bpl-card/articleshow/86244054.cms||---
---||Kozhikode||Kerala: IUML in a spot after former Haritha leaders flay leadership||KOZHIKODE: Former state leaders of Haritha, the women wing of MSF, criticized IUML’s leadership for not addressing ‘gender’ issues they had raised in their complaint while also accusing state general secretary PMA Salam of spreading falsehood against women student leaders, who had complained against three male MSF leaders for making anti-women and sexually-coloured remarks against them. In their first public appearance after they lodged a complaint with the women’s commission against MSF leaders– including state president PK Navas –former Haritha state president Mufeeda Thesni and general secretary Najma Thabsheera reiterated their charges and said that they were facing character assassination and cyber-attacks following the incident. “We approached the party after a painful campaign wounded our personality and portrayed us as wrongdoers. Unfortunately, party leadership was unable to imbibe the issue of gender and self-respect that we raised. Now, we have been forced to raise the issue publicly as the party state general secretary also disowned us and resorted to spreading falsehoods using his official position, which is ethically wrong and amounts to cruelty,” said Najma. She added that the agreement released by the party, which mandated the complainants to withdraw the complaint, was not unanimous. IUML had disbanded Haritha state committee after the 10 state office-bearers refused to withdraw their complaint against MSF leaders. MSF state president was arrested by the police and released on bail on September 10. “IUML convened only two meetings on the issue. At the first meeting chaired by Salam, the accused was asked to submit their version and we were told to disperse. When we said that we wanted a resolution, we got an arrogant reply that they (the party leadership) would decide and will inform us; that is the way the party functions,” she said. Najma said that Salam said that they (Haritha leaders) were coming to wander in Kozhikode market. Also, it was pointed out that taking the issue to the women’s commission was a crime, she said. “There is a saying ‘verbal rape after rape’. We are being portrayed as wrongdoers and having nefarious goals and thus we are again being defamed before the public, party workers, even our mothers,” she said. Mufeeda reiterated that Navas, while addressing the state working committee meeting on June 24, had invited the lone Haritha leader present to speak at the meeting by saying that ‘even a prostitute will have an opinion and now Haritha's representative can speak’. He had alleged that Haritha leaders were being led by a cyber-criminal and that MSF was not taking action against the cyber-criminal because the person had many photographs and videos of women student leaders and if he released them, then many leaders will have to commit suicide, she said. Hinting that they would not break away from the party, Haritha leaders said they would remain with the political ideology forever. Meanwhile, Najma recorded her statement under CrPC 164 at Kozhikode JFCM court over the complaint they had lodged with the women’s commission. Najma said she had given a statement remaining firm on the issues raised in the complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/iuml-in-a-spot-after-former-haritha-leaders-flay-leadership/articleshow/86244078.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan HC junks tax relief plea by liquor vendors||JAIPUR: The high court has rejected the plea of liquor license holders seeking waiver on the annual guarantee fee and tax relief for Covid second wave period. The single bench presided by Justice SP Sharma gave the order on a writ petition filed by Babu Khan and 120 others. According to the excise policy 2021-22, an annual guarantee amount is to be paid in 12 equal instalments. Accordingly, bidders have to lift the liquor worth the said amount in 12 instalments and the excise duty as well as additional excise duty are, therefore, set off by such lifting of the liquor worth the amount equal to the said instalments. However, if the licensee is not able to lift the liquor equivalent to the said instalments, he has to make up for the difference of annual guarantee amount payable for the period as well as the basic license fee payable on short-lifted liquor. The amount has to be paid in cash at the end of each quarter. The petitioners sought waiver on the annual guarantee for the first quarter during which they were unable to operate fully due to the restrictions imposed by the state government to curb the spread of Covid-19. The court said, “The loss caused to them cannot be put on the shoulders of the government as they were aware of the situation when they submitted their bids and accepted the conditions of the policy.” The court added, “Granting rebate in payments is an exclusive discretion of the state, who has laid down the excise policy. The state government would, therefore, be the best to decide on the matter."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-hc-junks-tax-relief-plea-by-liquor-vendors/articleshow/86246426.cms||---

Interestingly, while KPCC president K Sudhakaran and opposition leader V D Satheesan were highly critical of those leaders who have left the party, senior leaders such as Oommen Chandy and Ramesh Chennithala desisted from making any remarks against them. Satheesan said the resignations will not have any impact on Congress. “The party stood firm even after K Karunakaran left. Even if V D Satheesan leaves the party, it will not have any effect. Congress will stand tall, whoever leaves,” he added. In the past too many leaders have joined CPM after quitting the party and several from the Marxist party have come to the Congress fold as well. It is not a new phenomenon, he said, adding: “The party cannot tolerate leaders who are attacking the leadership in public,” said Satheesan. Former chief minister and AICC general secretary Oommen Chandy who had come to attend a function in the state capital on Wednesday was not ready to comment about K P Anilkumar’s decision to quit the party and join CPM. Meanwhile, Chandy’s trusted lieutenant Benny Behanan MP who was also the former UDF convener said the party leadership needs to do some introspection on why the leaders are leaving the party. “I am not justifying the leaders who have taken the decision to leave the party. But the state leadership should have a discussion on why these leaders are quitting. If there are disgruntled leaders in the party then they should be given the opportunity to be heard,” said Behanan. UDF convener M M Hassan said whoever have left the party till date all had secured several positions and received all the benefits of the party. He also rubbished the claims made by CPM that more leaders from Congress are getting ready to quit the party. One more leader quits Former KPCC general secretary G Rathikumar has quit from Congress and joined CPM.

We eat if there is food available; else, we shall go hungry. There are seven families here, but only two toilets. The facilities are insufficient. The toilets are located outside the school and are being used by the public also. It is difficult for women to use the restroom there. There are no educational facilities available for our children. The classes are being held online due to the epidemic. We cannot afford it due to lack of facilities, so their education has been stopped,” said Sabiyath Beevi, who stays at the UP School. Another woman, Fathima Beevi says that they are constantly worried about their children. “We came here because we had no other option. Most days, we are starving.

On Wednesday, post-mortem examinations were done and a case of accidental death was registered at Sankheda police station. “We have asked for officials of MGVCL to inspect the incident and give a report. Later, based on their report, we will decide on registering an FIR,” Sutaria said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/three-farmers-electrocuted-in-chhota-udepur/articleshow/86240978.cms||---

While 30,000 women in the UK have reported to the authorities about changes to periods or unexpected vaginal bleeding after taking the vaccine, Harvard Medical School and Johns Hopkins University are among the five US institutions that will shortly start a study into the link. In India, the discussion has so far been limited to whether women should take the shot during their period, with FOGSI (Federation of Obstetric and Gynecological Societies of India) issuing a statement in April there is “no physiological, endocrine or immunological basis affecting vaccination based on the day of the menstrual cycle”. At present, none of the vaccines mention irregular periods among the side-effects, but globally it is emerging as an important rights issue. The New York Times quoted Dr Hugh Taylor from Yale School of Medicine as saying, “This is an important, overlooked issue.” In Mumbai, too, patients have spoken to their doctors about changes that settled after one cycle. Gynecologist Dr Kiran Coelho said 50% of her patients who had taken the vaccine had complained of irregular periods. But she said, “Majority of my patients have had some irregularity in their periods since the Covid pandemic started. It is the overall stress that affects ovulation and the periods.” Dr Reena Wani, attached to BMC-run Cooper Hospital, Andheri, said there is no scientific data yet to prove the link. “Over 1 lakh people have got vaccinated at our hospital since January 16, and there have been no complaint.” In The BMJ, Dr Victoria Male from Imperial College London said “one important lesson” is the effects of medical interventions on menstruation should not be an afterthought in future research.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-brief-changes-to-menstrual-cycle-after-vax-under-study/articleshow/86246608.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 4 held in Dombivli killing; gang ‘lured, looted’ job seekers||KALYAN: Mechanical engineer Krishnamohan Tiwari’s murder case was cracked within four days with the arrest of four members of a gang, including a minor who is studying for a diploma in engineering. The gang’s mastermind allegedly looted job seekers like Tiwari (47) after assuring them of placements. Police said Tiwari’s father, Ramsagar, too was killed a few years ago over some other reason. They refused to divulge details of that case though. On Wednesday, police arrested Rihan Shaikh, Sagar Ponnalla and Sumit Sonawane in the September 11 murder case. All three are residents of Kalyan and aged between 20 and 25. The minor, who was sent to a remand home, is 17 years old. The police said Tiwari had lost his job in Qatar during the pandemic. He held a job there for six years. Tiwari is survived by his homemaker wife and two children, including a daughter who is in Class XII. Recently, Tiwari had approached a Diva-based placement agency where the main accused, Shaikh, was a staffer. Police said Shaikh used the placement agency data to access Tiwari’s details and on September 11 called him at 11.55am to Thakurli in Dombivli with a fictitious job offer. Vivek Pansare, deputy commissioner of police, Zone 3, Thane police, said, “When the victim reached Thakurli, the accused offered him a ride to ‘the office’ in an autorickshaw driven by Sonawane. During the ride, he first snatched the victim’s mobile phone and his bag. When Tiwari fought back, the accused attacked him with a large knife and a rod. He then dumped the seriously injured victim near Khambalpada and fled.” A traffic policeman spotted Tiwari and immediately rushed him to the local Shivam Hospital, where he died. Balasaheb Pawar, inspector of the local Manpada police station, said, “We initially went through the victim’s call records and found one suspicious call ahead of the crime. With this lead, we managed to track down Shaikh, the mastermind, and the others.” Pansare said, “We found Shaikh would obtain the phone numbers of job seekers at the placement company. Since Tiwari protested, the accused killed him. Our team is trying to find whom had the gang similarly robbed earlier.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/4-held-in-dombivli-killing-gang-lured-looted-job-seekers/articleshow/86244247.cms||Pradeep Gupta
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: 2020 in mind, hospitals keep infrastructure ready for post-festival Covid case spur||KOLKATA: Even as daily Covid-19 positive cases have been hovering around the 700 mark for almost two months now, Kolkata is already seeing a slight uptick in caseload. Doctors apprehend a sharper spike as the city gets closer to celebrating its biggest festival. Hospitals across the city have started gearing up to tackle patient rush in case of such a surge. “Last year, Covid-positive cases started escalating days ahead of Durga Puja and it swelled post the festival. We apprehend similar situation again. Hence, we are ramping up our preparedness, including stocking up on essential medicines, consumables and RT-PCR test kits,” said Peerless Hospital CEO Sudipta Mitra. Last year, from 2,000-plus daily cases across the state, the number started climbing ahead of the festival. It reached 3,000 in early-October and went up to 4,000 during and post the festival, the peak of the first wave. “We are already seeing a slight rise though the number is not yet alarming. Keeping in mind the possibility of a further increase, we are holding regular meetings on scaling up facilities in case of an abrupt jump. Experienced with two waves of the pandemic, we are more confident of switching gear,” said AMRI Hospitals group CEO Rupak Barua. RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) currently has 25 Covid patients, seven in critical care, which is almost double from a week ago. “In case the numbers keep rising, we will enhance our facility. Since the infrastructure is readily available, we can convert more non-Covid beds to Covid berths quickly and our medical team is prepared to handle the situation,” said Narayana Health regional head (east) R Venkatesh. Ruby General Hospital has already installed an additional LMO tank and is preparing a manpower roster to avoid any kind of crisis. “By mid-October, we will get 40 additional beds in our new wing, which we pressed into service in case a similar spike that we witnessed around the festivities last year,” said Subhasish Datta, chief general manager (operations) at Ruby. “There is the hypothesis of a third wave around October/November. With the festivities ahead, many people are likely to come out shopping. But we must remember to stick to Covid-appropriate behaviour,” said infectious diseases specialist Sayan Chakraborty of AMRI. Despite the potential surge ahead, doctors are banking on the good vaccination coverage in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/2020-in-mind-hosps-keep-infra-ready-for-post-festival-case-spur/articleshow/86241967.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The draft will serve as a guideline for doctors in treating the affected kids. Hospitals have also been told to mobilise equipment like high-flow nasal cannula and paediatric ventilators and to utilise the paediatric Covid facilities the state has already created for tackling the potential third wave so that the affected children get adequate medical attention. “The expert group met today and deliberated on the recent spurt in fever and respiratory tract infection cases among children. We have discussed the diagnostic protocol, treatment procedure and the protocol for intensive care unit and oxygen therapy,” said health services director Ajay Chakraborty. The expert panel also held a virtual meeting to explain the treatment protocol to all principals, CMOHs and hospital superintendents. The panel has doctors like Bibhuti Saha and Bhaswati Bandyopadhyay from School of Tropical Medicine, Mousumi Nandy and Mihir Sarkar from Medical College Hospital and BC Roy Memorial Hospital For Children principal Dilip Pal. “Bibhuti Saha reminded that we should investigate and exclude malaria, dengue, Covid and scrub typhus , because not all patients are similar and not all are viral or influenza,” said the DHS.The health department will also increase lab testing capacity and procure kits to identify the different respiratory viruses that is causing the current outbreak. “If the virus is identified as influenza, we can administer oseltamivir on children with acute respiratory distress for better treatment outcome,” said Medical College Hospital Kolkata PICU in charge Mihir Sarkar.

The last time the daily tally was higher was on July 15 (528). Daily detections in the state also reported a slight surge, resting at 3,783 cases and 56 fatalities."Every Wednesday, we register a rise in cases as more people start coming for tests after the weekend dip in testing. We hope this rise is part of the same trend and not the beginning of an upward tick," said a senior BMC official. Cases registered in Mumbai on Monday and Tuesday were 345 and 367, respectively. The BMC's public health department is not taking any chances. "We are worried about a rise in cases when people return from Ganpati festivities in Konkan or other areas. We have hence asked community health volunteers (CHVs) to seek such returnees and urge them to undergo tests," said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. Kakani, who took a review of nine wards, said there are no clusters but there have been small rises in cases in various localities. "We test high-risk contacts on the first or the second day of diagnosing a patient, and this helps us catch cases at the earliest," he said. Meanwhile, at the state level, due to a dip in testing, the daily positivity rate is on the rise, currently at 2.62%. Also, the weekly growth rate of cases in the state as of September 14 was 0.05%. Eight districts have a higher growth rate, the highest being in Ahmednagar (0.23%). Also, 17 districts have a zero growth rate. According to a review of the Covid situation in the cabinet on Wednesday, two districts -- Pune and Ahmednagar -- have a positivity rate of over 5%. Meanwhile, there is dip in active cases in the state, while, with an increase in daily detections in Mumbai, active cases in the city are on the rise. Mumbai has the third highest active cases in the state after Pune and Ahmednagar. Just a month ago, Mumbai did not feature in the top five. Health minister Rajesh Tope said the state is focusing on vaccinating as many people as possible to ensure that if there is a third wave, it is not severe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/daily-cases-cross-500-in-mumbai-city-most-in-2-mths/articleshow/86246743.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Mumbai||Had no info of Delhi cops’ raid: Maharashtra ATS||MUMBAI: The Dharavi resident arrested in a terror plot by Delhi police’s special cell had travelled to Bahrain in 2019 and was a known henchman of the Dawood Ibrahim gang, said police. The state anti-terrorism squad (ATS), which is coordinating with the Delhi police, said on Wednesday it had no information about the Delhi police action in busting a terror module since the central agencies had provided information, but Jaan Mohammed Shaikh alias Sameer Kaliya, 47, had been on its radar. The ATS is trying to find out why Kaliya had gone to Bahrain, who financed the trip and how many days he had stayed there, said a senior police officer. “In 2018, the police were probing a case involving D-company’s Faheem Machmach (who died recently in Pakistan) when the anti-extortion cell had kept surveillance on Kaliya,” he added. Kaliya, a cab driver, was arrested near Kota in Rajasthan on a train headed to Delhi. He is alleged to be the chief handler of a gang that was planning terror acts in multiple states and was tasked with supplying explosives and weapons. Six persons, including Kaliya, have been arrested. “There is a 20-year-old case against him (Kaliya) with the Mumbai police. We had no information about this case (terror module case). It was the central agencies’ information. The accused was on our radar,” said Vineet Agarwal, state ATS chief, adding that no recce had been conducted in Maharashtra. “On September 9, he (Kaliya) planned to travel but couldn’t get a ticket. He later booked a tatkal ticket through a travel agent for September 13 on the Golden Temple Express for Nizamuddin,” said Agarwal. Kaliya had taken money from his wife to book the ticket and made payment through GooglePay. No weapon or explosive was found on Kaliya at the time of his arrest. The old case against Kaliya was registered with the Pydhonie police station over alleged involvement in a firing case. Another case was registered in 2010 for electricity theft, and he is also named in two non-cognisable offences. “We are in touch with the Delhi police and our team is going to Delhi to question him,” said Agarwal, adding that Kaliya was an old D-company contact and henchman. Asked about Kaliya’s local associates, Agarwal said they had some information but cannot disclose it at this stage. The Delhi police had said on Tuesday underworld operative Kaliya, a close contact of gangster Dawood Ibrahim’s brother Anees, was tasked by a Pakistan-based person connected with underworld operatives hiding in the country to ensure the smooth delivery of IEDs, weapons and grenades to different entities in India. Five others, namely Osama Sami, Moolchand alias Saaju, Zeeshan Qamar, Mohammed Abu Bakar and Mohammed Amir Javed, were arrested with Kaliya. Apart from Delhi and UP, the module was planning serial blasts and targeted killings in Maharashtra and other states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ats-says-terror-accused-on-our-radar-went-to-bahrain-in-2019/articleshow/86244482.cms||Mateen Hafeez
---||Delhi||Delhi govt’s ‘lethargy’ behind delay in 100-bed unit: HC||NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court on Wednesday lamented that the “lethargy” of Delhi government was delaying the setting up of a 100-bed hospital in the capital, adding that it was the “misfortune” of the public that the project had not been completed yet. The high court was referring to a 100-bed hospital slated to come up in Najafgarh, and noted it was not completed because of the lethargic approach of Delhi government in processing the forest clearance in spite of the Centre writing to it. “Centre is writing letter after letter but no response from the government” a bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh remarked, asking Delhi government to take steps on the matter keeping “interest of the public in mind.” It granted time to the state government to file its reply to the petition and point out the least possible time within which the permission/sanction, as required by the Centre under law, will be granted. HC was hearing a PIL by Rajesh Kaushik, a lawyer, seeking directions to the two governments to finish setting up the hospital at the site of Rural Health Training Centre in Najafgarh in southwest Delhi. “You do something so that the construction is over. You can say no to the clearance request if it is as per law but don't sit tight” the high court advised the state government. The high court’s comments came after the Centre informed the court that the project was 80% complete and was awaiting clearance from the forest department of Delhi government in December 2018 as the site required a sanction for transplantation of trees. The petition said the structure of the building stood completed, and it was utmost essential for the public at large that the hospital started running before the onset of the third wave of Covid-19. The plea also argued there are no good hospitals in the area and the establishment of this facility would cater the needs of 15 lakh people spread over 73 villages in the radius of 10km. The matter will be heard on November 8.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govts-lethargy-behind-delay-in-100-bed-unit-hc/articleshow/86244322.cms||---

---||Kolkata||17km-long Bypass gets ready for makeover||Kolkata: The Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA) is working on a detailed plan to give the 17km-long EM Bypass stretch from Hudco junction to Garia, a makeover in a few years time with new flyovers, foot over bridges at busy intersections close to Metro stations, renovated carriageway, upgradation of the storm water drainage facilities, underground cable ducts, possible cycle paths and street furniture. The EM Bypass stretch, which is a major lifeline for the city’s road network, has increasingly become very congested and chaotic with traffic snarls, recurring potholed surfaces and waterlogging after heavy showers during monsoon. “The EM Bypass needs an overhauling with upgraded traffic management infrastructure. Apart from the already chalked out plan to set up the proposed Ruby to Kalikapur flyover along with a skywalk at Ruby intersection, a process is on to engage an agency that will do an assessment of the entire stretch that gets riddled with potholes and craters, especially during, and prepare a detailed report and find ways to correct the condition and improve the road,” said a KMDA official. The agency will also be giving recommendations as to how the road medians and existing storm water drainage facilities could be upgraded and revamped. They will also be coming up with proposals of setting up road safety furniture, exploring possibilities of having cycle strip, proposals for having underground cable ducts and other utilities on the Bypass stretch, officials added. KMDA officials further said that the top bitumen layer needs routine maintenance for every five years, as per instructions laid down by the authorities. However, the top layer of the EM Bypass surface was last laid on 2013-14 and is already overdue. Each year the condition of the stretch deteriorates after heavy rains and KMDA authorities conduct patch work on the damaged spots alongside taking other allied work as temporary measures to ease lives of the motorists. As for the traffic and transport infrastructure development plans which has already been chalked out to ease the traffic congestion on the stretch, the authorities have as of now finalized the alignment of the proposed Ruby to Kalikapur flyover that will connect from near VIP Baazar junction to Metro Cash& Carry. Another flyover has been planned that will start from near Metropolitan crossing on EM Bypass and will enter Salt Lake Bypass from Chingrighata crossing to go all the way to New Town. Once this flyover is set up, plan is to dismantle the existing Chingrighata flyover, which has been assessed to be beyond long term repairs. Baghajatin ROB on EM Bypass has also been planned to be thoroughly repaired by KMDA for smoother vehicular traffic. There are also plans to set up multiple foot over bridges on the stretch. One such footbridge is already being set up at Chingrighata crossing which is expected to be completed by the end of this year and more such footbridges are being planned at Metropolitan and Patuli crossing. Besides there is the skywalk plan at Ruby crossing. “Once these flyover and footbridge plans gets materialised along with total profile correction of the existing road surface and upgrading the drainage system, much of the traffic snarls and congestion on EM Bypass would ease out and the overall look of EM Bypass will change,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/17km-long-bypass-gets-ready-for-makeover/articleshow/86242075.cms||Suman Chakraborti
---||Delhi||Delhi: Kathputli Colony project may still prove lucky in 13th year of wait||NEW DELHI: While slum dwellers of Bhoomiheen Camp are soon going to be handed over flats built by Delhi Development Authority (DDA) at A-14, Kalkaji Extension, the residents of Kathputli Colony are still awaiting their promised one-bedroom flats in 14 multi-storey apartments 13 years since the public-private-partnership project was first announced. The 13th year, however, just might be lucky for one-fifth of the eligible slum dwellers. A DDA spokesperson on Wednesday said out of the 2,800 one-bedroom flats to be allotted to slum dwellers, 500 would be handed over in apartment blocks that were nearing completion. The remaining 2,300 flats would be given by the end of 2022. Kathputli Colony is DDA’s first in situ slum rehabilitation project for which tenders were floated in 2008 and work was awarded to a private developer in August 2009. In lieu of constructing the EWS houses, the developer would be entitled to build and dispose of some freehold HIG flats and commercial built up area equivalent to 10% of EWS floor area ratio on leasehold basis. The project was beset with setbacks and massive delays in every step, starting from surveying the eligible population, relocation of all slum dwellers to a transit camp at Anand Parbat and, finally, during construction. The foundation stone of the project was laid by Union housing and urban affairs minister Hardeep Singh Puri on April 24, 2018. It was announced that the first batch of slum dwellers were expected to be provided flats by March 2019. While the March deadline was missed, DDA hoped to open some towers by December 2019, but even that deadline was breached with the project facing one roadblock after another. Though work got affected due to the pandemic in 2020, the project was now taking shape. While relocation of Kathputli Colony residents began in 2014, all slum dwellers could be moved out only by the end of 2017. While the site was levelled the next year, power connection to the construction site stopped over the pending dues of earlier occupants. As this issue was sorted out, a ban on construction during winter again put a halt to the work. Apart from this, there were incidents like roads being dug up by another government agency and materials not reaching the site. The project received another setback in 2019 over a disputed plot for which DDA had to go to court. The under-construction complex would also have an exhibition museum to showcase the craft of Kathputli Colony residents, who are primarily artisans, including puppeteers, magicians, singers, etc. There would be a multipurpose hall, health centre, children’s play area, amphitheatre, retail outlets, police post, religious site and area for marriage ceremonies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/kathputli-colony-project-may-still-prove-lucky-in-13th-year-of-wait/articleshow/86244388.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Nagpur||Gadchiroli conflict worsens: Tiger kills man, leopard a boy||Nagpur: Even as massive efforts have been launched to capture the problem tiger of Gadchiroli, two, including a seven-year-old boy, were killed by it and a leopard taking the number of people killed in human-animal conflict in the last eight months to 11, 8 of them in just one month.As reported by TOI, at least 10 problem leopards captured from Chandrapur district were released in neighbouring Gadchiroli in little over a year. Now, not only tigers, but these leopards too are creating problems for locals.Official figures reveal that Maharashtra is reeling under the worst-ever human-animal conflict with 57 deaths in the last 8.5 months. Of these 57 deaths, 41 were due to tigers, 11 by leopards, 4 by wild boars and 1 by an elephant. Most of the deaths are in Chandrapur and Gadchiroli districts. The state has paid Rs 20 crore compensation towards human and cattle kills and crop damage.In the latest case, the victim, Bhomaji Nagapure (62), of Deloda village, had ventured into the Deloda reserve forest in Porla range to collect mushrooms and went missing since 3 pm on Tuesday. He was attacked by a tiger and his body was found on Wednesday morning.On Wednesday early morning, a leopard that had entered Mete Jangda village in Dhanora range was caught and released in the wild. In the evening, Manoj Devawar (7), Bhangaram Talodi (Gondpipri), was killed by a leopard in Markanda Kasona near Ashti in compartment number 217 of FDCM. Earlier, on September 4, a leopard had killed Mutta Tekulwar (55), Yella, in the Aheri range bordering Chaprala sanctuary.At one time, tigers and leopards had completely vanished from the tribal district of Gadchiroli. Now, there is a spurt in conflict. From January 27, 2019 to September 15, 2021, 18 persons have been killed by tigers and leopards. Most of the conflict has been happening in Porla and Chatgaon forest ranges in Wadsa and Gadchiroli divisions. Gadchiroli conservator of forests Kishore Mankar said, “All efforts to tranquilize and capture the animal are being made. If the menace continues, we will seek permission to shoot the tiger. We have deployed 50 camera traps. Outrage against the forest department is growing with various bodies launching protests over series of deaths.”State’s PCCF (wildlife) Sunil Limaye said, “Almost all the deaths have occurred in the forest areas. People should stop venturing into the forests, especially when there is a danger of being attacked. We have sought district collector and police help to see how we can stop people from entering the forest.” He added that two teams are at work and one more will join for monitoring. “We will also use drones at night. The forests have grown dense and hence visibility is an issue to track the tiger,” said Limaye.At a meeting on Wednesday, district collector Sanjay Meena has warned people of 15 villages not to enter the forest for the next 15 days. A primary response team (PRT) has been set up in every village.Gadchiroli honorary wildlife warden Milind Umre says, “In the Deloda attack, the victim had already collected mushrooms and returned home, but he again went into the forest to collect more.”“Mushrooms grow on the ground and one has to bend to collect them. When you are in a crouching position, the tiger assumes you to be a prey and attacks. Such attacks are common with mahua and tendu leaf collectors too,” said Umre.“The political leaders are raising a hue and cry over the deaths and demanding to shoot the tiger but none is pursuing the locals to restrain themselves from venturing into the forests. The teams are doing their job and baits are also been placed but sensing the trap the tiger is also changing places,” said another honorary warden Uday Patel.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Rs 3,200 crore for Konkan disaster mitigation||MUMBAI: The state cabinet on Wednesday cleared a Rs 3,200-crore Konkan disaster management programme under which several mitigation measures will be taken to tackle disasters in the region. In the last two years, the three Konkan districts – Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg – have been hit by two cyclones, a deluge leading to landslides and other disasters. As part of this programme, a comprehensive plan will be prepared for capacity building in these districts. An early warning system and better preparedness to deal with natural disasters will be a part of the programme. Of the Rs 3,200 crore, Rs 2,000 crore will be spent from the state disaster mitigation fund and the remaining Rs 1,200 crore will be given as part of the state budget in the next four years. There is also a plan to shift utilities underground so that they are not damaged, and also construct resilient infrastructure in the region. “The region is bearing the brunt of natural disasters quite often, and this programme will help handle them better. The idea is to reduce damage, improve response time and avoid loss of lives and damage to critical infrastructure,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rs-3200-cr-for-konkan-disaster-mitigation/articleshow/86244519.cms||---

Both were listed as heritage trees.After the environmentalists cried foul over felling, the CMC tree authority filed a criminal complaint against the guilty at Ramnagar police station. Officials said the clauses in the Maharastra (urban areas) Prevention and Protection of Tree (Amendment) Act, 2021, have provision of maximum fine up to Rs1 lakh and can also attract imprisonment for illegally chopping the trees.President of NGO Eco-Pro organization Bandu Dhotre also reached the spot after getting information and examined the damage to the trees.“One of the trees was cut from its base while the other lost all the branches and just the stump is left. Dozens of monkeys took shelter on these trees. The environment department has listed both the trees as heritage trees,” said Dhotre.In-charge of the tree authority Anup Tatiwar said no permission was sought for felling these heritage trees. He said the fallen trees stood partially over the land owned by one Gowardhan. One Prashant Mankar entered into an agreement for purchase of this land to build a house. “Mankar connived with the neighbours and deployed people to cut down the giant trees. We have lodged a complaint against Mankar and others with Ramnagar police for illegal felling of trees,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/two-100-year-old-tamarind-trees-felled-in-chanda/articleshow/86239387.cms||Mazhar Ali
---||Kolhapur||Discharge from Koyna dam down to 20,000 cusec||Kolhapur: The discharge from Koyna dam in Satara district on Wednesday reduced to 20,000 cusec as rainfall subsided in the catchment areas. On Wednesday, just 2 mm rainfall was recorded in catchment areas of Koyna dam leading to decrease in the inflow to 20,000 cusec. By Wednesday evening, Koyna dam was filled to 98.35%. The dam of 105 TMC capacity has a current stock of 103 TMC. The discharge from Warna dam too was reduced to 2,800 cusec on Wednesday. The decline in discharge led to the water level of Krishna river remaining constant at 21 feet at Sangli’s Irwin Bridge. To reduce the swelling of the river, the discharge from downstream Almatti dam was increased to 1.23 lakh cusec. As per IMD forecast, no rainfall in the ghat sections as well as free catchment areas is expected owing to which the threat of flooding is no more.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Cong a disintegrating house: CM||Thiruvananthapuram: Chief minister Pinrayi Vijayan said that Congress in the state is a disintegrating house. Leaders have started believing that the Congress is inefficient in the fight against BJP and hence they are leaving the party. The present trend is a healthy one since they are joining CPM, he added. If Congress leaders used to go to BJP in the past, now the state is witnessing a new trend. There were several attempts to block the leaders when they had threatened to join the saffron brigade. Some leaders were even given plum posts not to leave the party and join BJP, said the chief minister. “Now the situation has changed. The leaders have started believing that the present leadership is inefficient in fighting against BJP. They believe that only CPM can fight against BJP, and is the only secular force. That’s the reason why upset Congress leaders are now showing interest in joining the Left parties, especially CPM,” he said. “Everyone thought that there will be only one leader who will be coming to the CPM fold. But today another leader from Congress joined the party. Tomorrow we do not know what is in store,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cong-a-disintegrating-house-cm/articleshow/86244402.cms||---

Orders have been given to unearth the entire chain.” He said preliminary investigation has revealed that the seized articles belong to a habitual offender. Police authorities reiterated their suspicion that Beed with its long national highway 211 is being used by the gutka smugglers to transport the banned substance. “We suspect that whenever there is strict nakabandi or police checking on the highways, suspects use such godowns to hide the gutka,” said Hajare.

---||Delhi||Deja Vu? Why festive season may undo gains made in Covid battle||NEW DELHI: Festivals should be celebrated in a simple way in Delhi as these gatherings may trigger a surge in Covid cases and reverse the gain made in controlling the virus, experts have suggested during a recent Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) meeting. Last year, the viral cases increased during the festival season and the capital reported over 8,500 fresh cases on November 11. Dr V K Paul, member of Niti Aayog, said the Covid situation was under control at the moment, but people should stay cautious. Most of the experts, he said, believe that a third wave could be witnessed in October/November that coincides with the festival season. Dr Paul pointed out that gatherings during the festivals could easily reverse all gains made in the Covid-19 management. Prof Balram Bhargava, director general of Indian Council of Medical Research, stressed that mass gatherings must be discouraged and use of masks encouraged as vaccination didn’t prevent the disease. DDMA had banned the recent Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations in public places. All religious, political, social, cultural and other gatherings are still prohibited in the capital. Despite growing demands from the Ramlila committees to allow the annual event, DDMA has not yet given a green signal. The experts also underlined the recent spurt in flu cases and suggested enhanced testing and contact tracing during the festive season as the symptoms of the flu and Covid-19 were largely similar. AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria observed that the daily Covid-19 cases in Delhi were currently low and only very few hospital beds were occupied, but strict compliance of Covid-appropriate behaviour must be continued. Referring to influenza cases in the city, Guleria said stress should be on testing vigorously for early detection. An official informed DDMA that Delhi’s rate of tests was higher than the national average. The director of National Centre for Disease Control, Dr Sujit Kumar Singh, suggested that all gates to Delhi Metro stations be opened to bring down congestion. The daily fresh cases in the city have been in double digits and active cases have also fallen sharply, with very few deaths in recent times. The positivity rate is less than 0.1%. Daily tests have remained high with around 70% of them being more effective RT-PCR and the monthly occupancy of hospital beds has ranged from 2% to 5%. To maintain the improved situation, the authorities have intensified enforcement of Covid-appropriate behaviour and are issuing more challans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/deja-vu-why-festive-season-may-undo-gains-made-in-covid-battle/articleshow/86275160.cms||AlokKNMishra

The CSI bishop said that it is the state government that will have to examine whether there is ‘love’ and ‘narcotic’ jihad. The imam said that the war cry during the protest march of Muslim organisations in Pala should have been avoided. Both religious leaders decided to hold a joint press meet at the headquarters of the CSI church here on Wednesday in the wake of the protests and social media campaigns following the statements of Pala bishop Mar Joseph Kallarangatt on love and narcotic jihad. The CSI bishop, who said that all bad tendencies have to be opposed, however, refused to comment on the references made by the Pala bishop. He said that everybody has the freedom to express their views. “But we should be alert about those who make use of situations. It is the responsibility of the government to find out whether there is narcotic jihad.” He also said that the peaceful situation in the state should not be ruined in the name of a statement. The bishop also urged the state government to take initiative for talks to resolve the current crisis. Both the leaders said that by holding a joint press conference they aimed at maintaining peace in society. Police hold peace meet in PalaIn the wake of protests being held in Pala after Pala bishop’s ‘narcotic jihad’ reference, police held a peace meeting in the region on Wednesday. Leaders of various religions and communities from Pala and Erattupetta took part in the meeting convened by Pala DSP Shaju Jose. Those who participated in the meeting said that no religious organisations had any role in the protest programmes held in Pala in the last few days. The meeting also condemned the social media propaganda, which is ruining the peaceful atmosphere in the state. Police informed that strict action will be taken against those who indulge in such things. The DSP said that the police cyber wing will investigate and action will be taken against those behind false propaganda about a food processing unit in Erattupetta. He said that WhatsApp groups where communal comments or references are made will also be brought under the purview of the investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/csi-bishop-imam-hold-press-meet-caution-against-destroying-peace/articleshow/86244449.cms||---

---||Pune||Crimes in Pune up 121% on flouting of curbs||PUNE: The overall incidences of crime across the Pune police commissionerate increased by 121% last year as compared to 2019, largely on account of registration of cases of disobedience against people violating the lockdown and Covid-19 related curbs. The National Crime Records Bureau’s (NCRB) ‘Crime in India: 2020” report released on Tuesday showed Pune’s overall crimes (IPC and special legislative laws offences combined) at 35,847 in 2020 as against 16,181 the year before. In case of IPC crimes, which account for over 75% of the overall incidences, the cases rose to 32,513 in 2020 from 13,147 in 2019. This translates into a 147% rise in IPC crimes in 2020 over 2019. Pune’s rate of overall cognisable crimes was 710 per lakh population. The NCRB considered 50.50 lakh as Pune’s population on the basis of the Actual Population Census, 2011. Contrary to the disobedience-driven rise in crimes, the report showed that crimes against women and children, senior citizens, house break-in and thefts, burglaries, robberies and dacoities declined because of the Covid-induced restrictions. Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta told TOI, “The increase is mainly on account of IPC Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) cases registered throughout the year after the nationwide lockdown was declared in March last year and a prolonged period of curbs thereafter. Crimes have, otherwise, reduced as people were mostly confined to their homes for almost six months.” A senior police officer requesting anonymity said, “We had filed 25,753 cases relating to disobedience after the outbreak of the pandemic. The overall crime rate had reduced by 42% in 2020 comparing 2019 because of the pandemic. The detection rate of crime had increased by 70%. The crime rate had also declined because of the presence of policemen on streets on a round-the-clock basis and people were confined to their homes. We had also launched ‘nakabandi’ points for preventing people from venturing out in a bid to prevent the spread of the virus.” The officer said, “Murder cases had shown slight rise by 2% in 2020 as against those in 2019. We had received 7,700 complaint applications relating to cyber crime in 2019. The number of complaints increased to 14,000 in 2020 because of the excessive use of the internet after the outbreak of pandemic for receiving food/grocery and other parcels. The mode of communication had also increased because people were working from home. Online transactions had increased. Cyber crooks took advantage of the situation for committing a series of crimes relating to banking, business and online frauds and sextortion and other crimes.” In 2020, as many as 77 murder cases were reported as against 75 in 2019. But kidnapping and abduction cases went down to 435 in 2020 from 655 in 2019, the report stated. Crimes against children showed a downward trend in 2020 compared to 2019. The report showed a significant decline in crimes relating to senior citizens. In 2020, 123 cases relating to senior citizens were registered while 224 cases were lodged in 2019. The NCRB’s annual crime report is published on the basis of information provided by the state police units and the central law enforcing agencies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/city-crimes-up-121-on-flouting-of-curbs/articleshow/86244466.cms||Asseem Shaikh
---||Pune||Pune: Passengers’ harassment by auto drivers continues||PUNE: The Pune railway station bustled on Wednesday morning with passengers either rushing to board trains or dozing in various parts of the facility waiting for their journeys to start. Around 11:30am, TOI spots a young couple coming out and trying to take an autorickshaw that is on its way out of the station. A large group of autorickshaw drivers, wearing white shirts, khaki trousers and badges, surrounds the couple as well as the three-wheeler leaving the station. Within a few seconds, an argument starts. “ Pravashanna gheu naka anyatha samasya hoil” (Don’t pick up passengers from here or else there will be problem). What are we here for?” the group of autorickshaw drivers shouts. Amid all this, the couple walks out of the station. The recent gang-rape of a minor girl, for which 11 autorickshaw drivers were arrested, led to a joint drive by police and transport authorities, against the men driving the three-wheelers. The drive forced the autorickshaw drivers, especially those operating at the Pune station, to wear their uniforms and sport the badges. But commuters rue that the autorickshaw drivers’ behaviour has not changed much. Just 20 minutes after the couple’s harassment, a large number of autorickshaw drivers gathers near the main entrance as a train from Chennai arrives. Among the incoming passengers is Sangeeth K, who has to go to the Chandni Chowk area. He is approached by two autorickshaw drivers, who talk among themselves after learning about the destination. “Sir, it will cost you Rs 800. It is far and we are asking for a reasonable fare,” one of the drivers says. As Sangeeth asks them why won’t they go by the meter, one of them says, “Sir, meter me bhi same rate hi aayega” (In meter too, same fare will show). “I finally called a friend and learnt that my destination is around 12km from the station and that the maximum fare will be nothing more than Rs250 to Rs300. I am waiting as my friend said he will come to pick me up from the station,” Sangeeth tells TOI. Another couple, in the meantime, waits at one corner outside the station’s main building and is approached by another autorickshaw driver. The woman says they have to go to Kondhwa. “It will cost you Rs300. Wajib bhada maang rahe hain,(I am asking for a reasonable fare) ” the driver says, without any knowledge that the couple is from the city. “Do you think I am a fool. Ply by meter if you want us to go,” she says, after which the driver mumbles something and disappears from the scene. Right outside one of the main gates of the station, Jayesh Patil, who has come to the station for some reservationrelated work, boards an autorickshaw with the driver asking for Rs250 to go to MG Road and refusing to ply by the meter. On spotting another passenger waiting to go to the same area, the driver says, “Can I take him too?” Patil tells TOI, “I don’t know what is going on... He’s adamant about taking another passenger.” The driver snaps, “What do we do? The police are slapping fines on us. As a result, I want to make some more money in fewer trips.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/passengers-harassment-by-auto-drivers-continues/articleshow/86244487.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Covid, high price dampeners for kite-flying this season||KOLKATA: In the run-up to Vishwakarma Puja, the spirit and business of the kite-makers is not soaring high. A combination of factors, including the pandemic, farmers’ agitation in northern India, rising prices and unavailability of skilled makers, is threatening the traditional sport of kite-flying this Vishwakarma Puja. Manufacturers and sellers are reporting decline in sales of anything between 60% and 80% with many small units keeping their outlets shut at least for this year. Kite-flyers’ clubs in the city, too, said unavailability of good quality kites and high prices had deterred many of their members from indulging in the sport on Independence Day. “A lot of factors have converged this year and dealt a blow to this traditional sport very popular on Independence Day and Vishwakarma Puja,” said Souvik Ghosh of Airplay Gobindo, a century-old shop in Fariapukur in north Kolkata and one of the biggest names in the kite business. “The pandemic and related restrictions have disrupted the supply chain this year. Secondly, the prices have gone up, discouraging many people from indulging in this sport,” he added. Many manufacturers said the raw materials like the manja, white thread, latai — or the rolling pin — come from northern India. “Due to farmers’ agitation in Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, the vehicles are either not coming or taking a big detour, which is pushing up the cost,” said Anwar Ali of Baksh Ahmed Kites, a manufacturer in Sagar Dutta Lane in central Kolkata. Flying kites is an integral part of Independence Day. The tradition had started in the 1920s when people would fly kites with messages like ‘Leave India’ or ‘Simon Go Back’. “But this year, the participation is very low due to a combination of factors,” said Sourav Das, general secretary of the Kite Lovers of Kolkata. “Due to the pandemic, we could not assemble anywhere. Good kites and manja were not available too,” said Das. Some socio-economic reasons have already impacted the popularity of kite-flying among the youngsters. “Nowadays, there are no proper terraces because people are shifting to apartments. Mobile phones and online games have become more popular among children. Parents and elder siblings do not have much time to pass on the art of kite-flying to younger generations,” said Ghosh of Airplay Gobindo.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cov-high-price-dampeners-for-kite-flying-this-season/articleshow/86242270.cms||Zeeshan Javed

The DP was expected to be completed by December 26. A proposal on the six-month extension of the deadline has been tabled before the city improvement committee. “The code of conduct for the elections and then the Covid-19 pandemic had halted the DP work. Accordingly, more time should be given for completion of the development plan,” PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar said. The PMC had expressed the intention of drafting the DP in 2018 and had published the necessary maps. The merger of these villages was announced by the state government after the Bombay HC had told it to clear its stand about the merger. The merger ohas increased the city’s population by over 3 lakh.

They are even more powerful than some governments. Such a mafia is to be seen in that sense and a religious symbol should not be attached to it. What I had said earlier was about attaching such a religious symbol to it. The explanation of Pala bishop has already come that had clarified that the statement regarding narcotic jihad was not intended to create any religious tensions and the intention was only to caution their community,” he said. He said that what is to be ensured is that such statements do not go out of hand. He further said that other claims like attempts to lure the youth through black magic are baseless and those were something that were believed in the past. This is a scientific age and people have high scientific awareness. Without naming BJP which came in open support of Pala bishop’s statement, he said that there are some forces which are trying to use these in a wrong way with a communal mindset and such people will try to capitalise on these matters. He said that the suggestion of the opposition UDF to bring all these communities to a common table is a welcome suggestion, but there is no need to bring them to discussions with regards to hate campaigns. He said that the police will take stern action against those indulging in hate campaigns. The chief minister said that the government does not intend to register any case against Pala bishop with regard to his statements.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/fight-narcotics-without-linking-community-says-pinarayi/articleshow/86244539.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Neighbours shocked by Sameer Kaliya’s ‘terror links’||MUMBAI: Till Tuesday afternoon, few in Dharavi’s Social Nagar knew Jaan Mohammed Shaikh alias Sameer Kaliya, arrested in a terror case. Now, any kid in the Laxmibaug area of Social Nagar will lead one to Kaliya’s 10ftx10ft room, which has been locked since Tuesday night after police and TV journalists homed in. The Dharavi police recorded the statement of Kaliya’s wife late on Tuesday. Shortly afterwards, she left with the kids, most likely to put up with relatives. Neighbours were shocked when asked whether they knew about Kaliya’s terror links. “We only know that he used to drive taxis and later private cabs. He lived like any normal person in the area and interacted with us,” said his immediate neighbour. Another neighbour refused to believe the Delhi police claim that he was in a terror conspiracy. “He is a family man, we have seen him grow up. He has a daughter and a son. His parents passed away a few years ago. We don’t think he is involved in any anti-social activities,” he said. Kaliya, a father of two, was in debt and needed money, said a police official. After he lost his job, he used to drive a taxi that he had taken on loan. But he failed to pay and the bank took it away. Later, he took a loan for a two-wheeler and would sell gutkha and paan-beedi from his bike. Social Nagar, a stone’s throw from Sion station, is one of the oldest chawls in Dharavi. It has now been largely converted into commercial units as the garment industry boomed in the last decade. There are small manufacturing as well as wholesale units dealing in sportswear, jeans and kids’ garments. Most of the old residents have moved away.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-neighbours-refuse-to-believe-terror-charge-on-family-man/articleshow/86244508.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Pune||Five aspirants in Maharashtra score 100 percentile in JEE Main||PUNE: Beside the five students from Mumbai who scored 100 percentile marks in the IIT JEE exams, several students from Pune have notched up 99 percentile marks. Gargi Bakshi, Snehadeep Gayen, Ameya Deshmukh, Atharva Tambat and Saurabh Kulkarni from Mumbai were the five Mumbaiites who scored 100 percentile. Priyanka Date, an 18-year-old from Pune, had her best score of 99.94 percentile in the fourth session. “I wanted to qualify for JEE Advanced and I was preparing for it. I had not appeared for the fourth session with the intention to better my marks nor was I preparing for it. I wanted to get the feel of the examination. I have been preparing for the JEE for the past two years and I want to become an aerospace engineer. So, my dream is to get admission to the aerospace or mechanical engineering branch in IIT Bombay or Madras.” Durgesh Mangeshkar of the IITian’s Prashikshan Kendra said 56 students have scored above 99 percentile. “The cut-off for JEE Advanced qualification has dropped by 2.5 to 4 percentile points this year when compared with previous years because the average number of students per exam slot for all four attempts in JEE Main 2021 was significantly lesser than previous years. Since percentile is base sensitive, the cut-off score has decreased. Students who have qualified for JEE Advanced must take mock tests daily and analyse their performance deeply and devise a sound personalised attempt cum exam strategy,” he added. Director of Bakliwal Tutorials, Vaibhav Bakliwal said over 600 out of 1,000 students have qualified for JEE Advanced. “Santosh Deshineni with his 248th rank is the highest scorer in round four. It is necessary that students keep attending lectures and tests regularly to be well-prepared and to be in a positive frame of mind for the upcoming JEE Advanced,” he said. More than 125 students of the 145 from Prime Academy have qualified for JEE advanced and 14 students have made it to the 99 percentile club, said Lalit Kumar, founder director, Prime Academy. The National Testing Agency had conducted the JEE Main examination in four sessions in February, March, July and August-September. The result of the fourth session was announced on Wednesday. With JEE Advanced scheduled for October 3, students are in the last leg of preparations and educators said they must concentrate on mock tests and performance analysis every day. The JEE Advanced registrations started on Wednesday and will continue till September 20 while the last date to pay the fee online will be September 21. JEE Main cut off marks have been reduced by over 2 percentile points, compared with the last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/five-aspirants-in-state-score-100-percentile-in-jee-main/articleshow/86244524.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Delhi||Lok Nayak upgrading infra, will be ready if third wave strikes: Chadha||New Delhi: In case a third wave of Covid-19 hits the city, Lok Nayak Hospital will ensure best facilities in the paediatric ward, provide better infrastructure in intensive care units and will be ready with in-house oxygen production facilities, AAP legislator Raghav Chadha, who is also the chairperson of Rogi Kalyan Samiti of the hospital, said on Thursday. The hospital’s oxygen production facilities must ensure enough supply to avoid any scarcity, Chadha said. The hospital already has four oxygen production units and the process is on to build another. “The medical team also needs to lay out a plan for handling paediatric Covid cases, in terms of infrastructure, doctors and intensive care facilities available,” Chadha said. He also asked for updates on the supply chain management of essential and specialised medicines. Chadha directed the administration to hire doctors and paramedical staff as per the sanctioned strength through walk-in interviews instead of the exhaustive recruitment procedure to save time. The MLA also stressed on providing more waiting rooms to the patients’ attendants and said the waiting areas should provide peace and comfort to them. Directions were also given to get the approval for a pilot project to provide nutritious meals to the attendants for just Rs 10. “Food is a basic necessity and should be given at a pocket-friendly price. We can also increase the OPD timings so that more patients can avail treatment at one of Asia’s biggest hospitals,” Chadha said. Requirement of various machineries to tackle the case load was also discussed. The medical director said the equipment like external compressor for ventilators, infant warmer, portable ultrasound CR systems and ABG analysers had already been procured. Chadha was informed that the hospital was fixing the timelines to buy a CT scanner and digital radiology equipment. He also enquired about the availability of X-ray machines and if all are functional. Chadha asked the administration to get an ECMO machine in a time-bound manner. The machine provides prolonged cardiac and respiratory support to people whose heart and lungs can’t sustain life on their own. Chadha emphasised on quick completion of the work of remodelling the existing casualty block and visited the site where a new block for medicine, a maternity ward and an advanced paediatric centre is being constructed. He instructed the public works department to complete the work on a war footing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lok-nayak-upgrading-infra-will-be-ready-if-third-wave-strikes-chadha/articleshow/86275256.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

On the day of reopening, Alipore zoo recorded a footfall of approximately 1,200. The day started early at the city zoo, with the staff sanitising the entire campus with anti-viral spray. They also cleaned the enclosures and made a thorough check to make sure all Covid protocols were in place. The eight ticket counters were opened at 9am. Member secretary of state zoo authority, Sourav Chowdhury, said all Covid guidelines were strictly followed on Wednesday — from checking use of masks and making visitors undergo thermal checks to implementing social distancing on the zoo premises. “We didn’t use the sanitisation gates, instead we sanitised visitors’ hands before allowing them entry. Guards were also posted near enclosures to make sure all protocols were being followed,” he added. On the first day, the visitors’ excitement was palpable. Abdul Selim Gazi, a Garden Reach resident, who visited the zoo along with his wife, kid and a friend, said, “It’s great to spend some quality time amid the greenery around. My kid also enjoyed watching the animals. It was a much needed break.” Sweta Chaturvedi, a Class-III student from Chhattisgarh, who is in the city to consult a doctor, visited the zoo on Wednesday with her family. “We went to Victoria Memorial on Tuesday and came to the zoo, too. But it was closed but the staff told us about the reopening on Wednesday. So, we visited the zoo again today. I am very excited to have a glimpse of the animals like chimpanzee, tiger and elephant,” she said. Shreya Majumdar, a resident of Tripura who is in Kolkata now with her family, visited zoo on Wednesday with her husband, mother-in law and kid. “We went to Science City on Tuesday. Today, we decided to visit the zoo. We were very excited to know that it reopened today after Covid break. Visiting the zoo is a must if one is in Kolkata,” she added. Abhishek Kumar of Jharkhand, who has come to Kolkata to attend a family get-together, visited the zoo with 10-12 other members of his family. His son Ayan Arian, a Class-I student, said, “I spent time in front of the tiger enclosure. I was excited to see the tiger for the first time,” he said. Bengal Safari and Darjeeling zoo recorded footfall of 197 and 430 respectively on Wednesday.

A three-member team visited Loreto College on Wednesday even as other higher education institutions across Bengal await their turns. After every five years a NAAC visit is mandatory. Many higher education institutions have had to wait for more than one year due to the pandemic. The three-member NAAC peer team visited Loreto College, Kolkata on a two-day visit. The team chaired by S Yadav, the Haryana-based Bhagat Phool Singh Mahila Vishwavidyalaya vice-chancellor, also included S Tung, Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, member coordinator and S Shete, principal, Mahila Kala Mahavidyalaya, Beed. Maharashtra. Sister Christine Coutinho, principal, Loreto College, said, “We were scheduled for a NAAC accreditation in the 4th cycle in 2017, when we received a two-year extension as a high performing college. We have been waiting since 2019 for the NAAC peer team’s visit. We are happy the team has come now.” Many other colleges and universities are waiting for the NAAC to visit. After completing the paper work the NAAC authority is giving a three-day option to the institutions, from where they can select as per choice. Lady Brabourne College had a NAAC visit at the end of 2014 and was preparing for the visit in 2020, which was hampered due to the pandemic. Principal Siuli Sarkar said, “We are prepared and all the processes have been completed. Now we are waiting for the final date for the visit. Hopefully everything will be done by November.” Scottish Church College is also preparing for the NAAC visit as the 5-year term was over in 2019. Due to the pandemic everything was delayed. The authority has started repair work and paper submission process is going on. Vice-principal Supratim Das said, “The process is going on. Very soon we will upload SSR (self-study report), after that we are expecting three ranges of date options but we are ready for the NAAC visit.” Jadavpur University has also started collecting department-wise data to prepare the SSR. NAAC visits were completely stopped over the last one-and-a-half years due to the pandemic. Recently, in the NAAC’s EC meeting it was decided that in the process of NAAC accreditation, higher education institutions will have options to choose on-site or face-to-face peer team visit or a hybrid peer team visit due to the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/naac-team-visits-loreto-college/articleshow/86242321.cms||---
---||Pune||Swiss Jesuit priest Fr Hermann Bacher, known for water conservation work, dies at 97||PUNE: Swiss Jesuit priest Fr Hermann Bacher, known for his water conservation initiatives in Maharashtra and in India at large, passed away at his home in Switzerland on Tuesday. He was aged 97. Bacher, who first came to India in 1948, worked among rural communities for six decades. He is especially known for having conceptualized and deployed the bilateral Indo-German Watershed Development Programme in 1989, which later spawned the Union government-backed National Watershed Development Fund, which is run by Nabard — the apex bank for agriculture in India. The Indo-German Watershed Development Programme also gave birth to the Watershed Organisation Trust (WOTR) in 1993. Headquartered in Pune, it still works with a number of government and non-government stakeholders in water conservation activities across India, as well as for capacity building and training in that field. WOTR has an extensive training centre in Darewadi, which was later renamed after Bacher. The erstwhile German president, Horst Koehler, visited the centre in 2009, with WOTR having extensive partnerships with German donors and organisations. “Though he was born in Switzerland, he chose India as his place of work, and worked here till 2008, when he went back to Switzerland. He helped establish our organisation as well, after successfully implementing the Indo-German initiative,” said a source from WOTR. Tributes to Bacher were paid by the state revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat on Twitter, who noted his contributions to watershed management in Maharashtra, noting that he was recognized by the German government and the Maharashtra government for his work in India. He also expressed condolences for Bacher, whom he and his family knew personally as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/jesuit-priest-known-for-water-conservation-work-dies-at-97/articleshow/86244563.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Charges framed against five accused in Narendra Dabholkar case||PUNE: The much-anticipated trial in the August 20, 2013, murder of veteran rationalist Narendra Dabholkar is all set to begin from September 30, with the court of special UAPA judge SR Navander on Wednesday completing the process for framing of charges against the five accused. All the accused pleaded not guilty to the charges framed against them (see graphic) and said they were ready to face trial. Two of the five men are out on bail. The court has directed shifting of other two accused from Aurangabad and Mumbai jails to Pune’s Yerawada jail to ensure their presence during the trial. The court also directed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and its special prosecutor Prakash Suryavanshi to comply with the provision of Section 294 CrPC by furnishing a list of witnesses and documents to the defence lawyers, who sought enough time to prepare for the trial. “The trial will take time to begin because an opportunity will have to be given to the accused, their lawyers as well as the prosecution to prepare themselves,” judge Navander said. The next date has been scheduled for September 30. Three accused, Virendrasinh Tawde, Sachin Andure and Sharad Kalaskar, were produced before the court via videoconferencing mode from Yerawada, Aurangabad and Arthur Road jails, respectively. The remaining two, Vikram Bhave and lawyer Sanjiv Punalekar, who are out on bail, were present before the court in person and also signed the recording of their plea. Earlier, the court turned down Tawde, Andure and Kalaskar’s plea to defer the framing of charges. The judge told them that their lawyers have argued at length on framing of the charges and the matter can’t be re-argued. Defence lawyers Virendra Ichalkaranjikar and Prakash Salsingikar submitted that the accused needed sufficient time to prepare themselves for the trial. They submitted that the accused were lodged in different jails and the trial could not begin because of the CBI’s delaying tactic in the name of seeking opinion from the Scotland Yard and Gujarat forensic science lab. They said Punalekar and Bhave’s discharge pleas were pending before a Pune court, while Tawde, Andure and Kalaskar’s bail pleas were pending before the HC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/charges-framed-against-five-accused-in-dabholkar-case/articleshow/86244552.cms||Asseem Shaikh

---||Mumbai||Suspect was watched, no question of police failure: Maharashtra home minister||MUMBAI: Even as the Opposition targeted the state government over the arrest of a terror suspect by Delhi police, state home minister Dilip Walse Patil denied there was any lapse on the part of the state police and said this was not the time for politics, but for cooperation with the police. Walse Patil, who held meetings with top police officials in the state after the arrest, said there was a case against Jaan Mohammed Shaikh alias Sameer Kaliya of Dharavi from 2001. “Like other criminals, he was also being watched by the state police. There is no question of the state intelligence failure here,” the minister said. Earlier, BJP leader Ashish Shelar had asked if the Maharashtra ATS was sleeping since the Delhi police had to make the arrest. “This is happening because the state police are forced to focus on extortion and irrelevant cases because of political pressure. The police lodged a case against a Union minister and issued lookout notice against an MLA. They are not allowed to do their job,” said Shelar, referring to Narayan Rane and his son, Nitesh. Walse Patil hit back by saying, “This is not the time for politics… There is no question of interfering with the police.” Delhi police had kept the Maharashtra police informed about the case, he said. “In the past, the Maharashtra police have also arrested suspects from other states. When any state receives information about suspects, it has the right to arrest them,” he said, adding: “The state police are in touch with the Delhi ATS,” he said. Walse Patil pointed out the state police arrested a couple of persons from Delhi two days ago. The arrests are not related to the terror case, but it is a common practice followed by police forces, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-suspect-was-watched-no-question-of-police-failure-says-home-minister/articleshow/86244603.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar
---||Pune||Deadline to confirm over, 26,000 RTE seats in Maharashtra lie vacant||PUNE: The response to RTE seats in the state, despite the date for confirmation of admissions to the 25% quota seats being revised thrice, has been very poor. There are nearly 26,000 vacant seats in Maharashtra of the total 96,684 total seats. The deadline to confirm the seats has gone by. This year, the RTE seats in Maharashtra fell by nearly 8-9 % and the education department has been struggling to get confirmations for even the first round of allotments. Education activist Randhir Vishwasrao said the parents prefer to take a drop due to the virtual classrooms this year. “It is logical for parents, especially of children in the pre-primary section to skip the admissions this year as children in the four to seven years age group find it difficult to attend online classes. Many of these parents do not even possess the smartphones to give to their children and many more would have migrated to their home towns and taken admission in government schools nearby where education is free.” The lottery was announced two months ago and parents were given time with three deadline extensions to confirm the admissions in schools that were allotted. Last year, there were nearly 1.15 lakh seats for RTE which has been reduced to 96,000 this year. The allotments this year were announced by the state directorate of primary education for 82,000 seats yet many seats remain vacant. “We want every student to get a chance and our efforts are on to make sure that every allotted student takes admission. The parents are being sent SMSs to remind them about confirmation of admission. There are three rounds for parents to confirm the admission,” said director of primary education, Dattatraya Jagtap. The process will be on for another 20 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/deadline-to-confirm-over-26k-rte-seats-lie-vacant/articleshow/86244585.cms||---

Kalaskar, also an accused in the murder of Leftist leader Govind Pansare in Kolhapur in February 2015 and in an arms haul case in Mumbai, has sought a stay on the trial of these two cases pending before Kolhapur and Mumbai sessions courts, respectively. As of now, Kalaskar is lodged in Mumbai’s Arthur Road jail. His writ petition, filed through lawyer Jyoti Ghorpade, is at pre-admission stage, according to the information uploaded on the high court’s website. The petition primarily takes an exception to the fact that Kalaskar was produced before the trial judges concerned only twice between December 2019 and March 2020. Thereafter, he had not been produced even once before the trial judges till date, nor had he been given the reasons for not being produced before the court. It stated that the chargesheet in the case before the Pune court was filed in September 2016 and that before the Kolhapur court in December 2015. All this time, no charges were framed. All of a sudden, the Pune court was in haste to frame charges, the petition stated. Among the prayers, Kalaskar has urged the HC to call the case records from Pune, Kolhapur and Mumbai courts as well as from the Arthur Road jail authorities related to the production of accused before these courts from November 2019 onwards. — Vishwas Kothari||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/alleged-shooter-moves-hc-for-stay-on-trial/articleshow/86244590.cms||Vishwas Kothari

The police have also seized fake notes worth more than Rs 6 lakh. PI Sandeep Koli of the Surgana police station said that on September 6, two men were using fake currency notes of Rs 100 at the Umberthan market of the taluka. The suspects purchased articles worth Rs 10 and gave the sellers a Rs 100 note — to get genuine notes of Rs 90 back. While they were in the market, a woman selling vegetables got suspicious of the note she had received from the duo. Koli said the woman noticed that the paper was thinner than a regular Rs 100 currency note. The man had also purchased articles worth Rs 10 and got Rs 90 in return from two-three other vendors. After the woman raised an alarm, the other vendors also checked the notes given to them. Subsequently, they stopped the two buyers, and held them till the police came to the spot. “We rushed to the market and arrested two men — Harish Gujar (29) and Babasaheb Saed (38) — who are from Yeola. On frisking them, we recovered 194 notes of Rs 100 and one note of Rs 500. During the subsequent investigation, the police arrested Akshay Rajput (29) and Prashak Pimple (31) from Yeola, Rahul Chintaman Badode (27) and Ananda Kumbharde (35) from Chandwad, and Kiran Girme (45) from Vinchur, Niphad. Koli said the police have seized 1,056 fake notes of Rs 500 and 902 notes of Rs 100 amounting to Rs 6.18 lakh. Kiran Girme has a small printing press. He used to print the notes while the others used to circulate the same. The investigation is underway to find out how long the suspects were in the business of printing and circulating the fake currency notes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/woman-vendor-helps-bust-fake-note-racket/articleshow/86237092.cms||Santosh Sonawane

The release circulated from the official mail ID of the DCC on Tuesday ran contrary to the official position of the party, which distanced itself from the bishop’s statement on ‘’Love Jihad” and “Narcotic Jihad”. The Muslim League district committee strongly reacted to the DCC press note and demanded removal of the Kerala Congress (Jacob) leader K R Girijan who had issued it as the UDF district convener. Later in the day, the party’s district leadership denounced the statement, and issued a corrected version. District president Jose Valloor clarified that DCC totally adheres to the stance taken by KPCC on the observations of Pala bishop. Valloor went a little further and told the media that Girijan had issued the press release with ulterior motives. However he, did not explain how such a statement was circulated to the media from the DCC’s official email ID. The UDF district committee met in the evening as per the demand of the Muslim League. Muslim League district president C A Rasheed made it clear that UDF meeting on Tuesday had not taken any stance on the statement of Pala Bishop, and the League cannot proceed with Girijan as the district convenor of the UDF. Girijan did not attend the emergency meeting. Later speaking to reporters, UDF district chairman Joseph Chalisssery said the UDF meeting unanimously condemned the “false statement” issued on behalf of the front. “It was a wrong statement, the UDF meeting on Tuesday had not decided to support Pala Bishop,’’ Chalissery clarified. He said UDF district committee has given a detailed report to the state leadership on the issue and has demanded a decision before September 20. “Only the state leadership can take action against the district leaders of the UDF,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/thrissur-dcc-supports-pala-bishop-then-retracts/articleshow/86244627.cms||T Ramavarman

Madhuja Mukherjee’s ‘Deep 6’, along with Irfana Majumdar’s ‘Shankar’s Fairies’ and Bharat Mirle’s ‘The Road to Kuthriyar’, are the three Indian films selected in this section of BIFF that will be held between October 6 and 15. Among other members in this cast of ‘Deep 6’ is Soumitra Chatterjee, who plays the voice of reason. Quite a few films made by directors from Kolkata have made it to international film festivals of repute this year. Aditya Vikram Sengupta’s Bengali film ‘Once Upon A Time In Calcutta’ was in competition in the Orizzonti section of the recently concluded 78th Venice International Film Festival. If Aparna Sen’s ‘The Rapist’ is one of the seven nominees for the Kim Jiseok award at BIFF, Rajdeep Paul and Sarmistha Maiti’s ‘House of Time’ is competing in its New Currents section. According to Mukherjee, “International dialogues continue even as we sit in our individual corners and reimagine the world around us. These selections mean we are able to make films which present international subjects.” ‘Deep 6’ is a story of a journalist who strives to change things which appear fossilized. Amidst her daily chores, she takes a liking to her young colleague. As they begin to date, her colleague faces a growing bigotry while the journalist goes through a personal crisis. Her former partner is back since he would neither let go of the relationship nor their aborted political dream. “In the film, the personal meets the political, and realism bleeds into horror,” said the director, who is a professor of film studies at Jadavpur University. Shot across the city by Avik Mukhopadhayay, the film has a dense soundscape by Shomi Chatterjee and music by Prabuddha Banerjee. The cast includes Tillotama Shome, Chandan Roy Sanyal, Sumeet Thakur, Maya Ghosh and Sumanta Mukherjee. “Soumitra Chatterjee appears in an emblematic scene. He had dubbed for my film on the day lockdown was announced,” Mukherjee said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ju-profs-deep-6-makes-it-to-busan-film-festival/articleshow/86242350.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Mangaluru||City corporation approves DPR for waste collection||Mangaluru: The ruling BJP in the Mangaluru City Corporation council approved the proposed model to procure vehicles for door-to- door waste collection and outsource the operations and maintenance of the system. This proposal has been approved since the seven-year contract of the Antony Waste Handling Cell Pvt Ltd, the waste collection agency, ends on January 2022. At a special meeting held under the chairmanship of mayor Premanand Shetty on Wednesday, the Congress in the opposition, objected to the proposal, stating that it would be an additional burden on the civic body, and preferred a model of complete outsourcing. Explaining the DPR, prepared by the Anti Pollution Drive (APD), consulting engineer of the firm Akshay R said that Rs 38 crore would be required for the purchase of vehicles and equipment. The entire city will be divided into four zones—North, South, Central Zone-A and Central Zone-B for waste collection, instead of the present two zones. The city generates a total of 382.9 tonnes of waste daily. An official from the MCC said that depending on the population of the city, the MCC will require 789 pourakarmikas. The MCC has around 206 pourakarmikas. The process for the recruitment of 188 civic workers has been initiated by the DC, he said. MCC Commissioner Akshy Sridhar said that with the finalised DPR, the MCC will have assets in the form of vehicles. “We will enter into an agreement with the vehicle suppliers, to maintain the vehicles for a certain period of time,’’ he said. Meanwhile, the mayor said that a subcommittee will be constituted by including members from the opposition, for further discussion on micro planning of the DPR, within a week. The DPR will be ratified in the next council meeting. Similar proposals are being implemented in other city corporations in Karnataka.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/city-corporation-approves-dpr-for-waste-collection/articleshow/86239536.cms||---

Since April 1, 2019, Nashik district administration has notified 81 various services under RTS in which, respective departments have to respond to applications that people make for services within a stipulated time frame. There are more than 20 services notified by the state government. The government has written to divisional commissioners of the state asking them for suggestions on implementing the RTS Act in their jurisdiction across departments for which Nashik district has already started its time-bound decision-making system. In the letter, joint secretary Raviraj Phalle has sought their response on extending the RTS Act to 81 services as listed by the Nashik district collector . Under the RTS Act, the concerned officer must take the decision on the application with valid reason. The officer cannot sit on the application beyond a certain period and is answerable for the same. “We studied the government plan and checked our capabilities. We also focused on services that are required most and the time spent in the turnaround of an application. Considering the responses, we adopted the 101-service module,” Nashik collector Suraj Mandhare said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/state-to-adopt-nashik-rts-act-model/articleshow/86237185.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Mumbai||Issue NORI to med research scholar, Bombay HC orders ministry||MUMBAI: Paving the path for a 27-year-old from Khar working as a medical research scholar in the US to get her green card, the Bombay high court on Wednesday directed the ministry of education (MoE) to issue her a No-Obligation to Return to India (NORI) certificate. A bench of Justices Ram-esh Dhanuka and Riyaz Chagla quashed and set aside MoE’s July 28, 2020, order that had rejected Avani Vaishn-av’s review application for no-objection certificate (NOC) for NORI. It had cited the ministry of health and family welfare’s (MHFM) policy not to issue NORI to doctors practising in India. The judges also junked the MHFM’s order of March 22, 2021, that had declined the NOC after reexamining her case. Vaishnav, in her petition, said she passed MBBS in 2017 and applied for a J-1 visa (research scholar) visa. She accepted a New York hospital’s inte-rnship offer that would involve no patient contact or clinical privileges. She cannot reside in the US on a J-1 visa bey-ond May 2022. In 2019, the US consulate asked her for NORI certificate as a prerequisite for the green card. The Centre’s advocate, R V Govilkar, said it is MHFM’s policy to not issue NORI certificates to medical professionals below 65 years of age as there are 20.5 lakh doctors in India and there’s a shortage of four lakh doctors. But the judges said this “has no significance in the facts of the case and more particularly, in view of the undertaking” given by Vaishnav that she will not practice medicine in India or the US and would do only research work. “The respondents could thus not have refused to issue NORI on the grounds of her case not falling under the exception carved out in the policy...the respondents can impose a condition in the NOC...that in case the petitioner starts practising medicine in the US, the NORI would stand cancelled and she would have to come back to India,” the bench said. The judges agreed with senior advocate Y S Jahagirdar, for Vaishnav, that the Aurangabad bench in Sunil Noothi’s case had held that the policy won’t apply to research scholars. In view of the ministries’ stand not to issue NOC for NORI, the judges did not rem-and the matter back for reconsideration. Noting that it has “ample powers”, the HC directed MoE to issue NOC within four weeks and the authority concerned to issue the NORI certificate a week thereafter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-issue-nori-to-med-research-scholar-hc-orders-ministry/articleshow/86244691.cms||Rosy Sequeira

According to a new report of Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), around 3,711TPD of C&D waste is generated in Delhi, which is transported to the four existing C&D waste processing facilities with 4,150TPD capacity. “Three new C&D waste processing facilities have been proposed at Ranikhera, Tehkhand Okhla and Libaspur. The Ranikhera plant, with a capacity of 1,000 TPD under North Delhi Municipal Corporation, is under construction and expected to be commissioned by November,” said the DPCC annual report. It added that two more facilities were proposed at Tehkhand Okhla (1,000TPD) and Libaspur (500 TPD) under the authority of south corporation and PWD, respectively. Currently, four plants are located at Burari (2,000TPD), Shastri Park (1,000TPD), Mundka (150TPD) and Bakkarwala village (100TPD). “In these units, paver blocks, kerb stones, bricks, aggregates, sand, and soil of BIS standards are being produced, which is further used in infrastructure projects. With the existing and proposed processing facilities, it is expected that the entire C&D waste generated in Delhi will be managed properly in a scientific-manner,” said the report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-to-get-3-more-facilities-to-process-cd-waste/articleshow/86275304.cms||Priyangi Agarwal
---||Kozhikode||Now, a Church handbook draws flak||KOZHIKODE: A handbook published by the Catechesis department of the Thamarassery diocese with remarks about ‘love jihad’ has sparked a row with Samastha Rights Protection Samithi demanding confiscation of the book. The handbook allegedly says that love jihad is being implemented in nine stages and explains in detail about each of the stages and also has a section on the precautions to be taken to avoid falling into the “love trap”. The handbook also says that often a sort of black magic (kaivisham) is employed through Muslim clerics to seduce girls. It says that the black magic is performed by getting objects possessed by the girl like her pen, handkerchief, strand of hair or other objects. The book has been published for students of religious study classes in Class X, XI and XII. Meanwhile, Samastha Rights Protection Council in a statement said that the serious remarks made in the book that sexual exploitation of girls belonging to another religion was not wrong as per Islam but was a path to heaven was a deliberate attempt to create discord among various communities. The state government should immediately confiscate the books, Samithi chairman NAM Abdul Khader and other leaders said. The Catechesis department said in a press release later that the handbook was published not out of hatred but to keep the Christian youth rooted in their faith and to protect girls from exploitation. It added that they had received complaints of various forms of “sex terrorism” targeting Christian women and girls and an enquiry has found 100 such cases. The press release issued by Fr John Pallikkavayalil, director of catechism of Thamarassery diocese, said that they did not intend to hurt any religion or faith. “If anyone has had any misunderstanding or if it has caused hurt, then we express our sincere regrets,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/now-a-church-handbook-draws-flak/articleshow/86244680.cms||---

Students said that IIT-Bombay is like the ‘Mecca of Technology’, a dream institute that helps aspiring engineers to hone their skills and contribute something new. “I want to do something new in the field of computer science, be it new technology, software, or in the field of research. My dream is to study at IIT-Bombay and after pursuing computer engineering, I want to make my career in research,” said Ravija Chandel, who bagged All India Rank (AIR) of 509. She said self-study and consistency are the two key factors that help in scoring well in JEE (Main). Sheel Ranjan Bajpai with AIR 1,514 said, “I am fond of gaming and want to do something in this field. To fulfil my technology dreams, IIT -Bombay is the place to be as it has fantastic research, placement and an environment for promoting the setting up of successful startups.” He said, “I made sure to practice as many mock tests as I could and focused on making notes on every topic.” With start-up dreams in his eyes, Shashank Singhania who ranked 1,655, said that his first choice is pursuing computer science engineering from IIT-Bombay. Like his father Virendra Singhania, he wants to become a successful businessman. “I will learn technology and other skills related to the field to set up a business of my own,” said Shashank. He said giving equal time for studying every subject is the only key to get success in JEE.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/iit-bombay-top-choice-of-jee-main-high-rankers/articleshow/86246932.cms||Mohita Tewari

The MIDC police had closed the complaint lodged by its union leader Suresh Gotmare.On June 13, TOI had reported about the machinery going missing mysteriously from the plant and HAL, which is parent company of the MAPL, not registering any complaint. The plant was shut in 2003 and the machinery was intact till 2015. They went missing after the company’s revival was announced in 2015. The Bombay Security Services, engaged by MAPL, had lodged a complaint with the MIDC police about theft of machinery worth Rs 26,000 on April 14, 2016.After a series of reports by TOI, the HAL on July 26 lodged a complaint with the MIDC police informing theft of machinery and equipment worth Rs 75,74,100. The police had registered an offence against unidentified thieves, supervisor and guards of security agency.Police from MIDC police said that the statement of supervisors and guards of the security agency was recorded. “They have to say that they informed HAL officials many times about machinery being stolen from the plant from 2016. They also said HAL engaged 15 guards in 2002 but reduced it to three in 2015. They added that a part of the compound wall was demolished from where thieves used to enter. It was not repaired by HAL. They also informed that tall grass and bushes made it difficult to take security rounds. Even, power supply was not available,” the police said.Visit to scrap vendors is going on and further investigation is also underway, they added.51 days after HAL’s complaint, the police is yet to make any headway. “We have booked the supervisor and guards of security agency but they can be arrested only if we get evidence,” they said.Gotmare told TOI that stringent action should be taken against HAL officials. “It was the only government-run medicine manufacturing unit in Vidarbha and would have helped a lot in the ongoing pandemic,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hals-apathy-reason-behind-theft-of-mapl-machinery-security/articleshow/86239660.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Lack of eco-friendly options take many to Gomti river for Visarjan||LUCKNOW: Contrary to the land immersion witnessed in the past two years, majority of the devotees observing Ganesh Chaturthi are immersing idols in the Gomti river this year, TOI reality check on the fifth day of the festival on Wednesday found. Reason: The artificial ponds were covered with garbage and filth, leaving Ganpati devotees with no option other than to perform the ritual in the Gomti. Also, no banners or personnel were deployed by Lucknow Municipal Corporation - the nodal agency to facilitate land immersion- to handle an eco-friendly immersion with protocols in place. TimesViewOnly individuals are performing idol immersion as of now. More people will do so in the coming days. In fact, the ritual will be done by groups on September 17 and 19. LMC should create more pits for land immersion and make arrangements of cleaning them. Keeping the Gomti pollution-free is the collective responsibility of all.As a result, devotees who are conducting Ganesh Puja at home were seen individually performing the immersion in the river at Jhulelal Ghat and Kudiya Ghat, instead of the artificial ponds on Gomti banks- dug up to facilitate environmental-friendly immersion. Lucknow was first city in the state to completely opt for the land immersion in 2019 as per the directions of the high court. The LMC used to make provision of pits with paraphernalia to clean them regularly. On Wednesday, police deployed at the two ghats requested devotees to perform immersion in the artificial ponds but some of them went to the Jhulelal Vatika to perform immersion. “We wish to perform land immersion but how can we do so in a pond which is itself so dirty and unkept. We take it as an insult towards our God and the festival,” said Savitri Devi, a devotee. Nirmal Awasthi, another devotee who has been coming to Jhulelal Ghat for the past 4 years for immersion, said, “Even during the first wave of the pandemic last year, proper arrangements for land immersion were made, but this time nothing has been done. We all want to protect the river, but LMC should take the lead.” When contacted, additional municipal commissioner Abhay Pandey said, “We conducted a site visit on Wednesday and would make proper arrangements for immersion in the artificial ponds soon.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lack-of-eco-friendly-options-take-many-to-gomti-for-visarjan/articleshow/86246984.cms||Aditi Singh
---||Pune||Helping in our genes, collective effort can boost organ donation, says Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya||PUNE: Organ donation must pick up pace to match the wide gap between patients who need organs and their availability, Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya said on Tuesday. He was speaking virtually at the panel discussion comprising eminent experts. Mandaviya appreciated The Times of India’s initiative in spearheading the organ donation movement and keeping discussions alive on reinvigorating it. The discussion was part of the Times Organ Donation Drive initiated by TOI in association with Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital. “Helping is in our genes. We need to simply put in collective efforts to sensitise people on how they can help by donating organs,” Mandaviya said. He took note of the suggestions made during the discussion. “TOI’s organ donation campaign has the vigour and energy and the suggestions can turn things around,” he added. Renowned surgeon and Medanta Hospital’s chairman Naresh Trehan spoke about a white paper. “Sensitizing people and doctors, devising internal hospital mechanisms for identifying brain-dead patients and approaching relatives for counselling, will ensure that an organ donation is a full exercise. We should send our suggestions to the health ministry,” he said. Eminent liver transplant surgeon Mohamed Rela, chairman and managing director of Dr Rela Institute and Medical Centre, Chennai spoke about government efforts in funding transplant surgeries. “Tamil Nadu government funds transplant surgeries. Governments in all the states have the resources to boost organ donation and make transplant surgeries accessible to all,” Rela said. Noted urologist Sunil Shroff, managing trustee of the Chennai-based MOHAN Foundation, stressed on involving government hospitals and medical colleges to increase the organ donation numbers. Currently, the ratio at private and public hospitals in India is 90:10. “Government hospitals are so burdened with routine medical work that organ donation becomes the lowest priority. We need to strengthen it so that organ retrieval becomes a possibility,” he said. Of the 540 medical colleges in the country, 300 are government-run. Involving them will raise the numbers as government hospitals get many accident and trauma cases that can be tapped, Shroff said. He said cadaver organ donation takes place only in 16 states currently, and involving more states will improve the numbers. Santosh Shetty, executive director and chief executive officer of Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital in Mumbai, stressed on various campaigns encompassing television, print, social media and street plays to improve the donation rates. Aarti Vij who heads the organ donation programme at AIIMS, New Delhi spoke about talks with hospitals’ intensivists and neurophysicians to understand the roadblocks in identifying and certifying brain-dead patients. S K Mathur, president of Zonal Transplant Coordination Committee, Mumbai, spoke about the Maharashtra model wherein a multipronged approach involving hospitals’ CEOs, intensivists and counsellors have helped increase organ donation numbers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/helping-in-our-genes-collective-effort-can-boost-organ-donation-says-health-minister/articleshow/86244702.cms||---
---||Meerut||Asaduddin Owaisi is BJP’s ‘chacha jaan’, helping with religious divide: BKU||MEERUT: As Jat farmers come together with their Muslim counterparts to fight against the three farm laws, the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) said AIMIM is dividing people on the basis of religion, which is “helping BJP”. AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi, it said, is BJP’s “chacha jaan (uncle)”. At a private event in Baghpat, BKU national spokesperson Rakesh Tikait was scathing in his criticism of Owaisi. When he was asked about the new university named after Jat icon Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh, Tikait said he was “a king of farmers”. He added, “It is not a problem (for BJP) anymore. Chacha jaan Owaisi is here in Uttar Pradesh now. Even if chacha jaan abuses BJP, the party will not register a case against him. He has BJP’s blessings. He will divide people on the basis of religion and that is what BJP wants.” Tikait’s jibe came two days after UP CM Yogi Adityanath said “those who say "abba jaan" would digest all the ration (meant for the poor) before 2017 (when BJP came to power in the state).” Earlier this month, influential Muslim farmer leader Ghulam Mohammad Jola had shared staged with Tikait and his brother, BKU president Naresh, at the Muzaffarnagar mahapanchayat of farmers, where Tikait had raised slogans of “Allahu Akbar” and “Har Har Mahadev”. It was a symbolic move, of setting aside the bloody history of the Muzaffarnagar riots for a common cause. “Farmers understand their moves (that of Owaisi and BJP) very well," Tikait said. "Let them hatch conspiracies.” Circling back to the Mahendra Pratap Singh question, he added, “They place five bricks and say we are setting up a university in his name. Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh gave land to Aligarh (Muslim University). He gave land in Haridwar. He donated a lot of land and sold off his property for the freedom struggle. What can BJP say its line of leaders did? No one even went to jail.” About the farm laws, Tikait said farmers will not back down. “Our fight is with this government. Farmers won’t budge until the three laws are repealed,” he said. “The Centre says it wants talks but also says it won’t take back the farm laws. How are both possible?"||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/owaisi-is-bjps-chacha-jaan-helping-with-religious-divide-bku/articleshow/86239680.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Pune||No taking selfies & photographs near Ganesh pandals: Pune police||Pune: The city police have decided not to allow people click selfies, photographs and group photos near Ganesh pandals or in front of Ganapati temples during the ongoing 10-day festival to avoid crowding, especially in the old parts of the city. While the police and the civic administration have imposed restrictions to avert crowding and promote Covid-appropriate behavior, the situation on ground is far different. People crowd or line up to take selfies/photographs, throwing all caution to the winds. This has also raised fears of a possible surge in Covid cases after the Ganesh festival. The state government recently warned of re-imposing curbs if the weekly positivity rate and the occupancy of oxygen beds crossed the prescribed limits. Joint police commissioner Ravindra Shisve, who visited many pandals on Tuesday night to start a concerted action against crowding and devotees taking photograph, said, “We found that each individual spends around 6-10 seconds taking selfies or photographs, and this has been leading to crowding.” Shisve has issued orders to the Faraskhana, Vishrambaug, Khadak, Samarth and Deccan Gymkhana police stations, which cover the old parts and adjoining areas of the city, to not allow devotees to take selfies or photographs. Special branch officers have been told to chip in by monitoring the situation in front of temples and inside the pandals. Shisve himself led a team of officers in a drive between 9pm on Tuesday and 2am on Wednesday. The police have enhanced their round-the-clock bandobast even on the Shivaji Road, where majority of the prominent Ganapati mandals and temples are located. The police have deployed teams at different pandals and near temples to monitor activities of people, especially those moving in groups. “If the police teams spot anyone pulling out their cellphones to take selfies, the personnel will tell them to move away from the spot. If someone resists the police, officers will take strong legal action against that person,” Shisve added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/no-taking-selfies-photographs-near-ganesh-pandals-pune-police/articleshow/86244670.cms||---

The central government agency, WAPCOS, had conducted a third-party audit of the impact of spraying bio-decomposer on stubble at farms. WAPCOS, which works under Union Jal Shakti ministry, in its report has described bio-decomposer as a better solution to manage stubble. WAPCOS had conducted a field visit and surveyed 79 beneficiary farmers in 15 villages of four districts, who sprayed Pusa bio-decomposer that is provided for free by Delhi government. The major findings of the report were that 90% of the farmers said stubble decomposed in 15-20 days of spraying against 40-45 days earlier. The report added that organic carbon in the soil had increased from 5% to 42%, while nitrogen in the soil increased up to 24%. Wheat yield went up from 5% to 8%. Environment minister Gopal Rai said he, along with chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, would soon meet the Union environment minister and submit the audit report. Rai added that he would request the minister to make the neighbouring states use bio-decomposer too.

Last year, eight beaches across the country hoisted the international Blue Flags in virtual mode. It is learnt the ministry of environment, forest and climate change may select only three beaches this year due to time constraints. Dr Dinesh Kumar Y K, DCF, and in-charge regional director environment told TOI, “Since Kasarkod Beach in Uttara Kannada and Padubidri Beach in Udupi have already been certified, officials have decided to select a beach from Dakshina Kannada district. The district also has an international airport. Currently, two beaches—a stretch near TannirBhavi and Iddya Beach—have been proposed by the state for Blue Flag certification. The DC and the MLA have committed to provide funds for the peripheral works. “Since a large number of tourists visit Dakshina Kannada, it is important the district has a Blue Flag beach. The detailed project report for both the beaches have been submitted. The state has prepared a proposal for the development of 16 beaches, and the government was keen on taking up at least 10 beaches. The state government had prepared a DPR for six beaches early this year,” he said. The government in its pursuit of sustainable development of the coastal regions, embarked upon a highly acclaimed and flagship programme Beach Environment and Aesthetics Management Services (BEAMS) under the Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) project. This was aimed at striving for the coveted international eco-label Blue Flag, accorded by The Foundation of Environment Education, Denmark. The objective of the BEAMS programme is to abate pollution in coastal waters and beaches, promote sustainable development of beach amenities and facilities and protect and conserve coastal ecosystems and natural resources in accordance with coastal environment norms and regulations. The government has a target of having 100 Blue Flag beaches.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/two-mluru-beaches-in-race-for-blue-flag-certification/articleshow/86239704.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

CB had registered a case against Surendran in June accusing him of allegedly bribing his namesake candidate K Sundara to withdraw his candidature in the recently-held assembly election from Manjeswaram constituency. Sundara, who filed his nomination as BSP’s candidate, had in his statement told the police that he was given Rs 2.5 lakh and a smartphone by BJP leaders to withdraw his nomination. He told the police that he was initially threatened and kept in wrongful confinement for withdrawing his candidature. Sundara had allegedly named local BJP leaders Suresh Naik, Ashok Shetty and former Yuva Morcha state treasurer Sunil Naik for threatening and keeping him in wrongful confinement. Acting on the complaint of LDF candidate VV Rameshan, police had, in June, registered a case against Surendran under IPC Sections 171 (B) (bribery involving giving a gratification to any person with the object of inducing him or any other person to exercise any electoral right or of rewarding any person for having exercised any such right) and 171 (E) (punishment for bribery). Sundara contested as an independent candidate in 2016 assembly polls and secured 467 votes which saw Surendran losing by 89 votes. BSP district general secretary Vijayakumar B filed a police complaint after Sundara went incommunicado on March 20, stating that he suspected BJP workers were threatening Sundara to withdraw his nomination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/surendran-asked-to-appear-before-cb/articleshow/86244741.cms||---

The plot owned by the Maharashtra Housing Area Development Authority next to Rang Sharda at Bandra Reclamation was given on a 60-year lease to Gavaskar to develop an indoor cricket academy. However, he failed to develop it. Gavaskar was not available for comment. He informed TOI that he was in transit from London and would speak on Thursday. On Wednesday, the state housing department issued a government resolution allowing the cricket legend another opportunity to develop it. Gavaskar had in January this year sought permission to develop the land for badminton, football and table tennis. In past years he had sought and obtained permission to set up a squash court, health club, fitness centre, gymnasium and swimming pool. The project has also been renamed as Multi Facilities Sports Centre with indoor and outdoor facilities. Earlier, it was called the indoor cricket academy. As per the GR, Gavaskar will have to give 25% of profits from the enterprise to the government. It also directs him to clear all dues owed to Mhada and the government and sign an agreement with the authority within 30 days. Once the agreement is signed, Gavaskar will need to ensure that construction work starts within a year and is completed in three years. The plot was allotted to the Sunil Gavaskar Cricket Foundation Trust in 1988 and the terms and conditions for lease were revised on three occasions: 1999, 2002 and 2007. Gavaskar had even announced the plot would be developed jointly with Sachin Tendulkar. However, when he failed to develop it, Mhada moved to terminate the lease and served him a notice in 2019. BJP MLA from Bandra West Ashish Shelar who had written to Mhada to take back the plot said this was because Gavaskar failed to even build a compound wall to protect the plot and had not paid the lease rent for years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-gavaskar-assures-state-he-will-develop-plot-given-33-years-ago/articleshow/86244772.cms||Clara Lewis

Now 15, Enaith has bagged a silver in the Equestrian Premier League in August and is set to participate in the Regional Equestrian League (show jumping & dressage) in 105cm category at Bengaluru on September 25-26. The event, a precursor to the nationals, is being organised by the Embassy International Riding School, Bengaluru. Enaith, who comes from the illustrious Habibullah family, is a Class 10 student at the Doon School. “I took to horse-riding as it is in my family. My father, Amar Habibullah, and my grandfather, Wajahat Habibullah, gave me initial grooming. So far as my role model is concerned, I follow Olympian Fouaad Mirza who is also a family friend. He gave a brilliant performance in the Tokyo Olympics. Though he could not win a medal, he gave India’s all-time best performance. He was the first to represent India after Imtiaz Anees in 2000,” Enaith said. Enaith left for boarding school four years ago due to which his practice got affected as riding was possible only on holidays. However, after the closure of his school due to the pandemic, he decided to get professional training and went to Embassy International Riding School, Bengaluru, after which he won a silver in the Equestrian Premier League. “One has to qualify the Regional Equestrian League twice to make it to the junior nationals. The national event will be held in December,” Enaith said. Stressing on the need for improvement in infrastructure in Lucknow, Enaith said: “People in Lucknow are not very enthusiastic as turnout is low. We get a good crowd in Bengaluru.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/firmly-in-saddle-citys-young-equestrian-eyes-national-fame/articleshow/86247016.cms||Fazal Khan

Victim Bhaskar Suthar has registered a complaint of cheating against an unidentified man at City police station. In his complaint Suthar stated that he had gone to the bank on September 9 to transfer money in his fixed deposit account. When he was filling up cheque details, the accused approached him and introduced himself as Mahesh and told him that he is an employee of the bank and was recently transferred to the city from Delhi. Mahesh offered to help Suthar, but the latter filled the cheque details himself and also withdrew Rs 2 lakh from the bank counter. When Suthar was waiting for his turn, Mahesh again came and sat next to him. This scared Suthar and he decided to redeposit the cash in his account again. Mahesh then offered to help him deposit the cash following which he gave the accused the entire amount. Mahesh then went to the deposit counter for a while and returned with a bank deposit slip. But, before Suthar could verify the details in the slip, the accused said he will get a photocopy of the slip and then disappeared. Suthar told the cops that Mahesh walked out of the bank and he later learnt that the money was never deposited back in his account.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/conman-dupes-senior-citizen-of-rs-2-lakh-in-bank/articleshow/86240897.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Pvt schools to start offline classes for juniors in Oct||Ranchi: While many schools in Ranchi city are gearing up to start offline classes for classes VI to VIII next week, several of them would initiate the process in October. Jawahar Vidya Mandir principal Shyamali Samarjit Jana said his school would start classes from VI onwards only after the Durga Puja holidays. “We have to discuss with the parents and get their consent. Moreover, online examinations would start in our school, which would take two weeks. By that time the Durga Puja vacation would be close,” he said. Guru Nanak Higher Secondary School principal Manohar Lal said he is planning to call the students from next week. He said 50% of students would be allowed each day on basis of odd and even roll numbers. “The bus service also needs to resume to enable students to come to school,” he said. A Delhi Public School source said the school is planning to call the students from Class VI onwards from September 23. The school has been preparing for a hybrid mode of education for the past many days and for that, efforts are on to install WiFi on the entire campus. DAV Hehal principal MK Sinha said due to ongoing examination in his school, the junior students would be called from October 1. An official of Don Bosco School, Uma Shankar Sahu, said his school would start offline classes for Class VI onwards from next month. He mentioned that offline classes for class XII would begin from Monday and the process was delayed as all the teachers were not vaccinated. He added that students of classes IX, X and XI would be called by the end of the month. Principal of Seventh Day Adventists School, SDD Naidu, said his school is geared up to start classes from VI onwards from Monday. “We have over 50 classrooms. All the students would be called to the school but each section would be split into two batches and accommodated in separate rooms. The movement of students on the school campus would be restricted,” he said. Principal of Zila School, Ranchi, Deepa Choudhary, said examination of students is going on in her school, adding that it would continue till this week.

---||Ranchi||State lags behind in adopting battery-operated vehicles||Ranchi: The state has lagged behind in switching to e-vehicles and in all probability will fail to achieve the target set by the national campaign FAME-II (Faster Adoption and Manufacture of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles) which aims to register 30% of the new vehicles as battery-operated by 2030. As of September 13, out of the 60.24 lakh vehicles (that run on petrol/diesel) registered in the state, only 9,714 are battery-operated, which is when converted to percentage, comes down to 0.16%. However, the figure is lower as per FAME-II which says 705 two-wheelers, 349 three-wheelers and 33 four-wheelers are registered as e-vehicles in Jharkhand. The primary objective of FAME-II, which was launched by the Centre in April, 2019, is to encourage faster adoption of electric vehicles by offering an incentive for purchasing electric vehicles. Although the Centre grants subsidy for purchasing e-vehicles, unlike other states, no such offer is given by Jharkhand, part of the reason why people are hesitant to switch to battery-operated vehicles. Coupled with that, the fact that there are not enough charging facilities in the state is discouraging people from buying e-vehicles. Alik Bose, who owns Speedy Auto which deals in e-scooters, said, “People are slowly warming to the idea of buying e-vehicles owing to the rise in the price of petrol and diesel. The Centre provides subsidy on the cost of vehicle so Praise Pro -- one of our top brands -- which is priced at Rs 1.05 lakh but with subsidy, it comes down to Rs 76,848-Rs 90,000. Although other states provide subsidies, Jharkhand is yet to formulate such a scheme.” Speedy Auto co-owner Abhishek Kumar said the state government offers a discount of 25% on the registration fee of e-vehicles. “For promoting green transport, they could at least waive the registration fee,” he added. The state charges 9% for vehicles priced over Rs.1 lakh and 8% for vehicles priced under Rs 1 lakh as registration fee. Energy secretary Avinash Kumar said a proposal to promote e-vehicles is being brought up by the industry department while officials of Jharkhand Renewable Energy Development Authority said that a draft proposal is ready and awaiting the state government’s approval. The state industries department recently notified the Jharkhand Industrial and Investment Promotion Policy, 2021 but it did not contain any clause on the promotion of e-vehicles. A chapter on automobile, auto-component and electric vehicles mentions incentives for automobile the sector as a whole, but it does not say anything about e-vehicles particularly. The document also fails to envision the route map to transition and catching up with the FAME scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/state-lags-behind-in-adopting-battery-operated-vehicles/articleshow/86241637.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Goa||After a successful run in North, disability group’s ‘meet your soulmate’ initiative moves to South Goa||Panaji: After the first edition of ‘meet your soulmate’ — which encouraged persons with disabilities as well as those without to find a life partner — received a positive response in Panaji, the Disability Rights Association of Goa (DRAG) has planned another session this month, in South Goa. The organisers are hoping more women will participate in the session after the last one saw the attendance of more males with various types of disabilities looking for partners. “We are trying to encourage more women, or at least their parents or relatives, to attend the session. If someone wants us to approach another on their behalf, we will do that, too. We are willing to offer any services required and even direct them for medical advice or counselling as per their requirements,” president of the association Avelino de Sa told TOI. At the first meet, there were close to 40 persons, including those with disabilities, looking for life partners. Their relatives, family members and curious onlookers also attended. Member of the state advisory board on disability, Prakash Kamat, said there is still lack of awareness about the attributes of people with disability. “Stigma is prevalent. At the last session, some educated boys with stable jobs, who had minor disabilities like a limp, said that although women accepted them, their families had a traditional mindset and didn’t approve. We hope to spread more awareness on the issue through our sessions,” Kamat said. The marriage platform allows for open interaction. “At the last session a couple, Alency and Desmond from Quepem, spoke about their marriage. Alency doesn’t have a disability and Desmond is a speech and hearing-impaired person,” Kamat said. The second session of ‘meet your soulmate’ will take place on Saturday at Presentation Convent High School, Margao, and is open to all.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-a-successful-run-in-north-disability-groups-meet-your-soulmate-initiative-moves-to-south-goa/articleshow/86244978.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Justice Raina may not join as AFT judicial member||Chandigarh: Justice Rajiv Narain Raina (retired), whose name had been recommended as judicial member for the Armed Forces Tribunal (AFT) by the central government may not take up the assignment. Highly placed sources confirmed that he had not accepted the offer that has come after a prolonged delay. When TOI contacted Justice Raina about these reports, he did not deny these, but refused to make any formal comment about his reasons. Justice Raina, who retired as high court judge from the Punjab and Haryana high court in July last year, was expected to be posted at the Chandigarh bench of the AFT. The Chandigarh bench has a significant number of cases related to the armed forces tribunal. It has jurisdiction over the states of Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Chandigarh and Jammu and Kashmir. Names of five other retired high court judges, Justice Bala Krishna Narayana, Justice Shashi Kant Gupta, Justice K Harilal, Justice Dharam Chand Chaudhary and Justice Anjana Mishra had also been recommended as judicial members for various benches of the AFT. There are 17 benches of the AFTs in 11 different places across the country but there is an acute shortage of judicial members in these benches. As per the reliably learnt information, only four benches of the AFT are operating in three cities---Delhi, Chandigarh and Lucknow. While Delhi has a principal bench, others are regional benches. One bench consists of one judicial member, who is normally a retired judge of the high court and one administrative member, who is a retired senior military officer of the rank of Lieutenant General. The quorum of the bench, which is empowered to decide a case, is completed only when it has both judicial and administrative members presiding over it. The tribunal had been facing a shortage of judicial members for long, and it was only after the reprimand from the Supreme Court that the Centre had recently cleared six names of retired judges of the HC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/justice-raina-may-not-join-as-aft-judicial-member/articleshow/86245239.cms||Ajay Sura
