The Raos are popular for their aesthetic home-made Ganesha idols, which grace some of the biggest homes and pandals in the city. "My father Mohan Rao started making these idols over nine decades ago; this is our 92nd year," smiles Ramachandra Rao, 72, who is joined in this noble task by his brothers. "We learnt idol making from my father and he taught us the most delicate nuances of carving Ganesha idols. Even though we all pursued regular professions, this is something we will never let go of. My brothers and I are joined by our entire family during the festive season to make these idols. Our sons, daughters-in-law, grandkids and cousins, everyone comes home to lend a hand," Ramachandra tells us. This year, the family has made the highest number of idols thus far -- 230. In keeping with the pandemic, the family has requested all their patrons to collect the idols much before the festival to avoid rush hour and ensure social distancing. And if the idols are in such high demand even after all these decades, it's because the Raos do not compromise or cut corners when it comes to their idols. The clay for the idols comes from a field in Ganjimutt, on the outskirts of the city. The straw comes from a friend's farm. "During my father's time, we'd procure it from the paddy fields around Mangaluru but with these lands slowly disappearing, we had to fetch it from Ganjimutt," shares Ramachandra. Ask him about the debate around making eco-friendly Ganeshas and he quips, "We have always been making our idols out of clay which is the most eco-friendly material you can find. And unlike cities like Mumbai, we never use plaster of Paris and distemper. It's always eco-friendly paint sans lead, which will not harm the water body where you immerse the idol," states Ramachandra. On a parting shot, we ask him his opinion on innovative Ganeshas -- of him playing cricket, wearing a cap amongst others. "In South Kanara, we respect our Gods and traditions. These are sentiments that can't be played around with. Ganesha always sits and that is how we will always depict him. This is not a profession for us, but a sacred task," sums up Ramachandra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/family-makes-ganesha-idols-has-kept-tradition-on-for-92-years/articleshow/86062137.cms||Madhu Daithota

Sources said 20 such equipment will be rolled out for this project. With this, India is now coming in the select group of countries like Italy, Norway, Korea and China, which have been designing and manufacturing such equipment, the railway ministry said. These equipment built in India, for the first time, will end or reduce dependence on import of such equipment for mega elevated infrastructure projects. Officials said the “straddle carrier” flagged off by the minister is the biggest in the country and the “girder transporter” for transporting and fixing full span precast girders is the largest in India. These equipment have been built by the construction major, Larsen and Toubro in India, which has bagged the tender to build the major stretch of the first High Speed Rail corridor in the country. According to the National High Speed Rail Corporation Ltd (NHRSCL), which is implementing the project, 85% of the components used in the two equipment has been sourced from India and 15% from Spain and Germany. The “straddle carrier” is a tyre mounted self-propelled gantry crane designed to handle the full span precast girders from casting bed to stacking yard. This has 80 tyres. The crane has the capacity to lift up to 1,100 tonnes and a 52.5 meter long and 37 meter wide girder at one time. Similarly, the 27-axle tyre mounted self-propelled trolley “girder transporter” having 216 tyres is designed to transport the full span precast girders fed by bridge gantry to erection location. Speaking at the flag off ceremony, Vaishnaw said soon there will be more High Speed Rail projects in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rail-minister-flags-off-full-span-launcher-for-bullet-train-project-india-makes-it-to-select-group-of-nations/articleshow/86078536.cms||Dipak K Dash

IGP Vijay Kumar said the police were checking the mobile phones and laptops seized from the four journalists suspected to be involved in running a Pakistan-origin propaganda blog called "Kashmir Fight". The police have registered an FIR at Kothibagh police station in Srinagar against Showkat Motta, Hilal Mir alias Saqi, Mohammad Abbas Shah and Azhar Qadiri. Shah, who had been working for a Srinagar-based Urdu newspaper, was fired by his employer within hours of the raid on his house. The other three suspects are currently not on the rolls of any known publication, channel, portal or agency, the police said. IGP Kumar said the numbers of various contacts in Pakistan, Turkey and Saudi Arabia had been found on the mobile phones of the suspects. "They also seem to be communicating with many virtual numbers. Based on the available information, a search was conducted at four places with search warrants from the special NIA court on September 8." All four journalists have been summoned for another round of questioning on Friday. "This is an investigation into an extremely sensitive case, which is why we advise all in the media and various journalists' bodies not to spread false news," the IGP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/dont-meddle-in-probe-into-journalist-terror-nexus-jk-igp/articleshow/86079679.cms||M Saleem Pandit

---||World||Taliban say Haqqani on US terror list is violation of Doha pact||ISLAMABAD: The Taliban accused the United States on Thursday of violating the peace agreement inked between the two in February 2020 in Doha by keeping its new interior minister, Sirrajudin Haqqani, on its terror list. The statement was issued by the new Afghan government hours before some 200 people, including Americans, left the war-battered country in the first international commercial flight to depart Kabul airport, for Qatar, since US forces left Afghanistan 10 days ago. The Doha deal had paved the way for the exit of US-led foreign forces in return for a guarantee from the Taliban not to allow groups such as Al Qaeda and ISIL to operate on Afghan soil. In the wake of the deal, the US had pledged to remove Taliban members from international terror lists. The new minister, who is part of the Haqqani Network formed by Jalaluddin Haqqani, his slain father, had been accused of attacks on US forces in Afghanistan during the past 20 years. He is on the FBI’s most wanted list and carries a $5 million bounty on his head. He is also on a UN blacklist along with over a dozen other Taliban cabinet members, including acting PM Mullah Mohammad Hassan Akhund. "Pentagon officials have remarked that some cabinet members of the Islamic Emirate or family members of the late Haqqani Sahib are on US blacklists and still targets," read a statement issued by the Taliban foreign affairs ministry. "The Islamic Emirate considers this a clear violation of the Doha Agreement, which is neither in the interest of the United States or Afghanistan," it stated, referring to the agreement signed in the Qatari capital. According to the statement, the Haqqani family "is part of the Islamic Emirate and does not have a separate name or organisational setup". "Similarly, in the Doha Agreement all officials of the Islamic Emirate, without any exception, were part of the interaction with the US and should have been removed from the UN and US blacklists, a demand which still remains valid," the statement said. It termed statements by the US and other countries as provocative and accused them of trying to meddle in the internal affairs of Afghanistan. The statement added that Afghanistan "condemns" this in the "strongest terms". "Such remarks by US officials are a repetition of past failed experiments and such positions are detrimental for America," the statement said. "We urge that these incorrect policies be immediately reversed through diplomatic interactions," it said. For the past few years , Kabul airport had been known as Hamid Karzai International Airport. The Taliban have now renamed it Kabul International Airport. On Thursday morning, a Qatar Airways plane had arrived in Kabul carrying aid. In the evening, it departed for Doha with passengers, including a large group of foreigners, on board. During a recent visit to Doha, US secretary of state Antony Blinken had urged the Qatari authorities to help them with evacuations. Hundreds of Afghan citizens who had helped the US military were unable to get out in last month’s US airlift. More than 124,000 foreigners and Afghans fearful of Taliban rule have flown out of the country so far. In a press conference at the airport, Qatari special envoy Mutlaq bin Majed Al Qahtani described Kabul international airport as operational. "This is a historic day in the history of Afghanistan as Kabul airport is fully operational. We have been faced by huge challenges … but we can now say that the airport is fit for navigation," he said. Qatari and Turkish technical teams have helped restore operations at the airport, which was damaged during the chaotic evacuations of tens of thousands of people to meet the US troop withdrawal deadline of August 31. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid thanked Qatar for its assistance in making the airport operational and for humanitarian aid to Afghanistan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/taliban-say-haqqani-on-us-terror-list-is-violation-of-doha-pact/articleshow/86080451.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

Biden will join the first-term Democratic governor in the Southern California city of Long Beach on Monday, the day before voting ends. He's the last of a string of prominent Democrats who have come to the deep-blue state to assist Newsom as he faces a recall election.  Vice President Kamala Harris, a California native, campaigned alongside him Wednesday, and former President Barack Obama appeared in a campaign ad urging Californians to vote no on the recall.  Biden's visit, his first to California since taking office in January, underscores the importance of his party maintaining the governorship in the nation's most populous state, which has the fifth-largest economy in the world. California has been the breeding ground for progressive policies on climate change, immigration and more. Beyond Harris, a handful of Biden's Cabinet members have roots in the state.  Newsom also has been one of the most aggressive governors when it comes to the coronavirus, mandating that children wear masks in school and that health care workers get the vaccine. His restrictions on businesses and schools have been a driving force behind the recall as the pandemic remains a dominant force in American life during the first year of Biden's presidency.  The visit also gives Biden a chance to demonstrate his political clout amid a difficult stretch of his presidency following the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. A poll by the Public Policy Institute of California taken from August 20-29 showed 58% of Californians approve of Biden's job performance. A terrorist attack in Afghanistan killed 13 US service members and many more Afghans on August 26.  The California Republican Party criticised Harris' visit, saying it was inappropriate for her to campaign while Californians remain stuck in Afghanistan. On Thursday, an estimated 200 foreigners, including Americans, left Afghanistan on a commercial flight out of Kabul.  Talk radio host Larry Elder, the GOP frontrunner in the recall, said Harris and Biden were trying to distract attention from Newsom's record on widespread homelessness, rising crime and long-running school and business closures during the pandemic.  All California voters received ballots in the mail. The ballots have two questions: Should Newsom be recalled and, if so, who should replace him? He'll be removed from office if more than half of voters want him gone.  Biden's stop in the state is part of a two-day trip to the Western United States. He'll stop Monday in Boise, Idaho, to visit the National Interagency Fire Center and then head to Sacramento, California, to survey wildfire damage before appearing with Newsom. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday that Biden wants to highlight how wildfire season has become a year-round event, and how one in three Americans - or nearly 100 million people - have been affected by various forms of severe weather this year.  Scientists say climate change has made the American West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.  Biden also will visit Denver on Tuesday to promote his economic agenda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-to-campaign-monday-with-newsom-as-recall-nears-end/articleshow/86081880.cms||---
---||World||Biden pulls nomination of Chipman to lead ATF firearms agency||WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden on Thursday withdrew his nomination of gun control advocate David Chipman to head the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives - a federal agency pivotal in his goal of lowering US firearms violence - blaming Republican opposition.  Chipman, who previously worked for the ATF for nearly 25 years, had drawn strong Republican opposition in the Senate, undermining his chances of winning confirmation in a chamber only narrowly controlled by Biden's fellow Democrats. Republicans generally oppose gun control.  Senator Angus King of Maine, an independent who usually votes with the Democrats but was a holdout on Chipman, also was a key factor in the decision to withdraw the nomination, according to two sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.  In a statement issued by the White House, Biden put the blame on Republicans, noting that Chipman, a gun owner himself who had won the backing of law enforcement groups, would have made an exemplary ATF director. The agency, part of the United States Justice Department, has responsibilities, including investigating the unlawful use and possession of guns and illegal firearms trafficking.  "Unfortunately, Republicans in Congress have made clear that they intend to use gun crime as a political talking point instead of taking serious steps to address it," Biden said.  "That's why they've moved in lockstep to block David Chipman's confirmation, and it's why they side with gun manufacturers over the overwhelming majority of the American people in opposing commonsense measures like universal background checks for gun buyers," Biden added.  Biden has called the US gun violence a "national embarrassment", but Congress has failed to pass new firearms measures favoured by many Americans.  White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Biden intends to nominate someone else for the ATF post and is in "active discussions" with Chipman about another government role. The job of ATF director is so politically fraught that the Senate has confirmed only one nominee to the post in the past 15 years. The rest of the ATF's leaders have served in an acting capacity, making it harder to put their stamp on lasting and meaningful policy.  Republicans and pro-gun groups including the National Rifle Association and National Shooting Sports Foundation had opposed Chipman, known for his work at a prominent gun control advocacy group. Chipman serves as a policy adviser for Giffords, a group founded by former US Representative Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, Senator Mark Kelly, after a gunman shot her in 2011.  Republicans. in particular, opposed his support for banning military-style assault weapons, which have been used in some of the most serious US mass shootings in recent years.  Mitch McConnell, the top Senate Republican, wrote on Twitter he was glad to hear of the withdrawal, calling Chipman's nomination "absurd".  "This is a win for the Second Amendment and law-abiding American citizens," said McConnell, referring to the constitutional amendment that guarantees the right to bear arms.  Kris Brown, president of Brady, a group advocating for stricter gun regulation, called Chipman "exceptionally qualified" to lead the agency.  The Senate Judiciary Committee in June split along party lines when it voted to advance his nomination. That meant Democrats would have had to jump through procedural hurdles to get Chipman confirmed.  During his confirmation process, Chipman confronted a social media disinformation campaign falsely claiming he was involved in the deadly 1993 stand-off with the Branch Davidian cult in Waco, Texas.  The ATF is positioned to play a vital role in Biden's pledge to crack down on rising violent crime and shootings. Attorney General Merrick Garland has pledged that the ATF will crack down on gun dealers who fail to conduct background checks, do not assist law enforcement with tracing guns used in crimes, falsify records or sell guns to people prohibited from owning them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-pulls-nomination-of-chipman-to-lead-atf-firearms-agency/articleshow/86081899.cms||---

Modi mentioned in his remarks that Brics had recently adopted a counter-terrorism action plan. The group said it recognised the threat emanating from terrorism, extremism conducive to terrorism and radicalisation. ``We reiterate that terrorism should not be associated with any religion, nationality, civilisation or ethnic group. We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to contribute further to the global efforts of preventing and countering the threat of terrorism on the basis of respect for international law, in particular the Charter of the United Nations, and human rights, emphasising that States have the primary responsibility in combating terrorism with the United Nations continuing to play central and coordinating role in this area,’’ said the Declaration.

Expressing concern over the situation in the restive country and strongly condemning the deadly terror attack outside the Kabul airport on August 26, the Brics nations stressed the need to refrain from violence and settle matters by peaceful means. “We stress the need to contribute to fostering an inclusive intra-Afghan dialogue so as to ensure stability, civil peace, law and order in the country,’’ said the New Delhi Declaration after the summit.

---||World||Taliban takeover sparks fear for Afghanistan's heritage||ISLAMABAD: Bamiyan's cultural centre should have been completed last month, showcasing the remarkable heritage of a site that Afghanistan's Taliban desecrated two decades ago by dynamiting ancient statues of Buddha. But the red carpet celebrations will have to wait. After the Taliban swept triumphantly into the capital Kabul, everything was put on hold. "Everything is suspended," said Philippe Delanghe, from UNESCO, the UN's cultural agency, who said they are awaiting the decisions of the new regime. Afghanistan once stood on the legendary Silk Road trade route, a crossroads of ancient civilisations. Now in the hands of the hardline Islamist Taliban, there are fears its heritage is at risk. In March 2001, the Taliban spent weeks using dynamite and artillery to blow up two giant 1,500-year old statues of Buddha, carved into a cliff at Bamiyan, some 175 kilometres (78 miles) west of Kabul. Many consider the wanton destruction to be among the world's worst cultural crimes. It was an act that brought the Islamist's radical ideology to global attention, just a few months before Al-Qaeda -- who the Taliban hosted in Afghanistan -- carried out the devastating 9/11 attacks on America. "We judge by history, and 20 years ago there were terrible results," Ernesto Ottone, UNESCO's assistant director general for culture, told AFP. In February, the Taliban said that Afghanistan's relics were part of the country's "history, identity and rich culture" and that "all have an obligation to robustly protect, monitor and preserve these artefacts". Among Afghanistan's top sites are the Buddhist shrines at Mes Aynak, and the 12th-century Minaret of Jam, a UNESCO World Heritage site. But since seizing power, the Taliban have said nothing more. There are worrying signs. In mid-August, residents in Bamiyan accused the Taliban of blowing up a statue honouring a Hazara leader -- an ethnic group persecuted by the Islamists -- who they had killed in the 1990s. AFP could not confirm the reports, but social media images appeared to show a decapitated statue. Philippe Marquis, director of the French Archaeological Delegation in Afghanistan (DAFA), told AFP he remains cautious about what will happen. "We have no declarations saying: 'We are going to destroy everything or erase everything from the non-Islamic past'", he said. Since 2016, it has become a war crime to destroy cultural heritage sites. Many are worried for the National Museum in Kabul, which survived being ransacked both during the 1992-1996 civil war that followed the Soviet military withdrawal, as well as under the Taliban's first regime, from 1996-2001. Some feared the prospect of mass looting, as happened following conflict in Iraq and Syria, where extremist fighters raised funds by selling ancient artefacts on the black market. However, the Taliban's seizure of Kabul was achieved with barely a shot being fired, and the museum appears to have emerged unscathed. Only a third of the thousands of priceless objects in Kabul's museum have been catalogued. Kabul museum director Mohammad Fahim Rahimi told the New York Times last month the Taliban had promised their protection. But he added he still has "great concern for the safety of our staff and our collection". International funding for cultural protection has also been suspended, and it is not clear when it would resume. "We are holding our breath," Marquis said. "But I hope that soon we will be able to breathe a little lighter." Many Afghans who were working to protect cultural heritage have fled abroad, or are in hiding and too scared to speak out. Those who do have warned that the Taliban promises of protection are empty rhetoric to win international support. "As illiterate extremists, they are proud to destroy non-Muslim monuments," said Mustafa, a former UNESCO employee at Bamiyan, now a refugee in Germany. An official who worked for the Bamiyan government said Taliban fighters smashed instruments and art objects belonging to the culture department after seizing the province in early August. "I was sad, but I couldn't protest," the official said. "I had no guarantee that they weren't going to accuse me... of idolatry and turn their guns on me and kill me."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/taliban-takeover-sparks-fear-for-afghanistans-heritage/articleshow/86082914.cms||---

---||World||Vessel runs aground, briefly blocking part of Suez Canal||CAIRO: A bulk carrier vessel became wedged Thursday in Egypt's Suez Canal, briefly blocking traffic in one lane of crucial global waterway, Egyptian authorities said. The Suez Canal Authority said in a statement that the Panama-flagged Coral Crystal ran aground in a double-lane stretch of the canal, forcing the officials to redirect other vessels in the convoy to the other lane. The canal transits two convoys everyday: One north-bound to the Mediterranean and the other south-bound to the Red Sea. It said the canal's tugboats managed to float the south-bound vessel, which carries cargo weighing 43,000 tons. The Coral Crystal then resumed its voyage, the canal said. Admiral Ossama Rabei, head of the Suez Canal, described the incident as a "very brief grounding," which was resolved in a "professional manner." Geoge Safwat, the canal spokesman, said 61 vessels, carrying a total of 3.2 million tons cargo, transited in the Suez Canal on Thursday. "Traffic (at the canal) was not negatively impacted in anyway," since it was redirected to the other lane of waterway, he said. Officials have not said what caused the vessel to run aground. The nearly 225-m (738-feet)-long and over 32-m (104-feet) wide ship was built in 2012. It was en route to Port Sudan on the Red Sea, according to Traffic Marine, a vessel tracking firm. Thursday's incident came less than six months after the massive Panama-flagged Ever Given ran aground in the single-lane stretch of the canal. The hulking vessel blocked the canal for six days before being released in a massive salvage effort by a flotilla of tugboats. The blockage earlier this year disrupted global shipment. About 10% of world trade flows through the canal, a pivotal source of foreign currency to Egypt. Some 19,000 vessels passed through the canal last year, according to official figures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/vessel-runs-aground-briefly-blocking-part-of-suez-canal/articleshow/86083000.cms||---

A bench of Justices M R Shah and Aniruddha Bose said an entry in revenue records does not confer title on a person whose name appears in record-of-rights. “Entries in the revenue records or jamabandi have only “fiscal purpose”, i.e., payment of land revenue, and no ownership is conferred on the basis of such entries. It is further observed that so far as the title of the property is concerned, it can only be decided by a competent civil court,” the court said. “As per the settled proposition of law, mutation entry does not confer any right, title or interest in favour of the person and the mutation entry in the revenue record is only for the fiscal purpose. As per the settled proposition of law, if there is any dispute with respect to the title and more particularly when the mutation entry is sought to be made on the basis of the will, the party who is claiming title/right on the basis of the will has to approach the appropriate civil court/court and get his rights crystalised and only thereafter on the basis of the decision before the civil court necessary mutation entry can be made,” the bench said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mutation-doesnt-give-property-ownership-right-supreme-court/articleshow/86082968.cms||---
---||Business||Ford calls it quits in India over losses, poor sales||NEW DELHI: Americans auto giants don’t seem to get it right when it comes to making cars and motorcycles for Indians. After the exit of General Motors and Harley-Davidson, it’s now the turn of another iconic brand Ford to quit India. Having invested over $2.5 billion in India, and with a presence since 1995, Ford ended 2020-21 selling 48,042 units to garner a 1.8% share of the pie. The company promised that “restructuring” of its India business — that will see its two plants in Chennai and Sanand shut down by the second quarter of next year — will not mean end of services and after-sales support for the roughly 10-lakh customers it has in the country as its 300-odd dealerships will remain open for service. “This is a very difficult decision. No matter what we tried and investigated, all our projections show we will continue to give sub-optimal returns to shareholders and investors. There was no other option, but to restructure,” Anurag Mehrotra, MD and president of Ford India, said as he outlined a new strategy that would see the company begin import and sale of “must-have, iconic vehicles”, including Mustang coupe. Ford said it took the decision after considering several options, including partnerships, platform sharing, contract manufacturing with other makers, and the possibility of selling its manufacturing plants, which is still under consideration. “Despite these efforts, we have not been able to find a sustainable path forward to long-term profitability that includes in-country vehicle manufacturing,” Mehrotra said. The move will see many of the 4,000-odd permanent employees of Ford India move out. “Ford will work closely with employees, unions, suppliers, dealers, government and other stakeholders in Chennai and Sanand to develop a fair and balanced plan to mitigate the effects of the decision,” the company said. Dealers fear that apart from jobs at Ford, over 40,000 employees at the company’s retail points also face a threat around their employment. Vinkesh Gulati, president of dealers’ association FADA, said Ford dealers have invested around Rs 2,000 crore towards retail and service infrastructure. “The retail fraternity is really shocked to hear Ford's announcement where it has said that it will shut down production,” FADA said. While the writing was on the wall for several months, Thursday’s announcement brought finality to it. Ford failed to grow in a market where others such as Maruti, Hyundai, Tata Motors and Mahindra, reaped in dividends. Newcomers such as Korean Kia and China’s MG Motors also managed to get a solid opening, despite starting late in 2019. Ford’s losses to date stand at $2 billion (it also effected a $0.8 billion non-operating write down of assets in 2019), and the company says it preferred to invest money in markets where it can fetch returns than sink further cash in India. However, the exit carries further cash outgo for the company, which is estimated at over $1.7 billion, including various settlements, apart from $0.3 billion in non-cash charges. The company will, however, continue the ‘Ford Business Solutions’ programme in India, where it employs 11,000 members engaged in software development, data science, R&D, and finance and accounting. Ford India will maintain a smaller network of suppliers to support engine manufacturing for exports and will work closely with other suppliers to ensure a smooth wind-down of vehicle manufacturing. The closure comes months after Ford’s last-ditch efforts to forge a JV with M&M failed. The partnership, which had been in the works since 2019, was called off on the last day of 2020, as Mahindra decided to go back to “core fiscal discipline”.

Many villagers and devotees took part in the auctions held by the Malingaraya temple committee on Wednesday, the last day of Shravana, as part of the Sri Beeralingeshwar fair. “Lord Malingaraya is considered to be a form of Shiva’s Nandi and the coconut kept in the deity’s gadduge (throne) is most sought-after by bidders since it is considered to be divine and lucky,” said Basu Kadli, secretary of the temple committee.

This time, bidding started at Rs 1,000 and within minutes, crossed Rs 1 lakh. “Then, another devotee quoted Rs 3 lakh and we thought the bidding would end. After that, Mahavir quoted Rs 6,50,000 and got the coconut,” Kadli said. “The temple committee will utilise the auction proceeds for development and other religious works.” Harake said while many think it is imprudent to pay so much for a coconut, it is a matter of faith for him. “When I had severe health problems and suffered loss in my business, I prayed to lord Malingaraya. Within a few months, I overcame my issues. I will keep the divine coconut in my home and worship it daily as it will bring luck,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/devotee-pays-6-5l-for-lucky-temple-coconut/articleshow/86083600.cms||Basavaraj Kattimani

As per pension scheme requirements, the freedom fighter, Gundu Rao Desai from Kamalapura of Hospet taluk, had to submit two affidavits from two co-detainees. The court noted that the freedom fighter’s petition had specifically mentioned in a letter dated January 20, 2021 that only one co-detainee is alive now and all others were long dead. The statutory authorities’ approach to the state’s compassionate policies like freedom fighter pension schemes should not end up hijacking justice by “ritualistically adhering” to the letter of law at the expense of its spirit, the high court has said. A sking him to produce the affidavits of two co-detenus virtually amounts to compelling him to retrieve the dead from their grave, infuse soul into their body and ask them to swear to the affidavit. This is an impossibility, at least with all the progress medical science has till now achieved,” Justice Krishna S Dixit observed. “Otherwise, (to borrow the words of Justice Benjamin N Cardozo) they (the authorities) may be likened to surgeons who would rather have their patients die in accordance with the principles of surgery than live contrary to them. That is not a happy thing to happen in an arguably sane world. It is not the case of the respondents that the petitioner is guilty of fraud, fabrication or the like,” Justice Dixit said. The authorities have to sanction the pension with effect from March 19, 1998 (date of the petitioner’s claim) and settle arrears in six weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/freedom-fighter-wins-23-yr-old-pension-claim/articleshow/86083603.cms||Vasantha Kumar

The three colleges which have made the cut are Bengaluru’s MS Ramaiah College of Arts, Science and Commerce (No. 62) and St Joseph’s College of Commerce (74) and Mangaluru’s St Aloysius College (95). This is the sixth edition of India Rankings instituted by the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) by the ministry of education, which now ranks higher education institutions in 11 categories. IIT-Madras retained top position in the ‘engineering’ and ‘overall’ categories. Among the universities, IISc-Bangalore is ranked number one, followed by JNU. In the research category introduced this year, IISc-Bangalore emerged topper and IIT-Madras second. Region-wise, Tamil Nadu has 19 institutions in top 100 universities, followed by Maharashtra with 12 and 10 from Karnataka. Karnataka’s star institutions aced their respective domains: In law, National Law School of India University continued to be no. 1 and IIM-Bangalore was ranked no. 2 in management. Nimhans was ranked no. 4 in medical and no. 42 in research. Nine medical colleges feature in top 50, with two of them (Nimhans and Kasturba Medical College, Manipal) in top 10. Among engineering colleges, there are eight from the state in top 100 and 19 in top 200. National Institute of Technology-Karnataka is ranked 10. An earlier study in NIRF ranking 2020 by two academicians — G Srinivas and S Salil — had pointed out that the state’s higher education is skewed towards professional education and hence the disparity. In universities list, after IISc, Manipal Academy of Higher Education features at no. 7. Mysore University (19), Bangalore University (69), Kuvempu University (81) and Visvesvaraya Technological University (82) also feature in top 100.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/iisc-top-univ-3-karnataka-colleges-in-nirf-top-100/articleshow/86083610.cms||---

As per the state government order, people are allowed to have idols in public pandals for up to five days. Asked whether public Ganesha celebrations will be allowed in the city for five days as per the government’s order, BBMP chief commissioner Gaurav Gupta said: “BBMP had issued guidelines based on the ground situation, inputs from the police department and considering the assembly session beginning on Monday. It is now being clarified that the government order will prevail.” The BBMP rethink came after CM Basavaraj Bommai on Thursday said he directed ministers, BBMP officials and city police to discuss the demand for relaxation of curbs and come up with a solution. In the morning, a group of people led by Bengaluru Mahanagara Ganesha Utsava Samiti staged a protest outside the BBMP headquarters demanding relaxation in Covid curbs for the festival in line with the government’s order. The protesters demanded that groups in wards be allowed to keep idols in public as opposed to BBMP’s order of having only one public Ganesha idol in a ward, lifting of the 4ft cap on the idol height and permission for immersion processions. Vishwa Hindu Parishat, Hindu Jagarana Vedike and Bajrang Dal took part in the protest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bbmp-mulls-easing-curbs-on-ganesha-celebrations/articleshow/86083612.cms||---
---||World||US President Biden announces sweeping new Covid vaccine mandates for 100 million Americans||WASHINGTON: In his most forceful pandemic actions and words, President Joe Biden on Thursday announced sweeping new federal vaccine requirements affecting around 100 million Americans in an all-out effort to increase Covid-19 vaccinations and curb the surging delta variant. Speaking at the White House, Biden sharply criticised the roughly 80 million Americans who are not yet vaccinated, despite months of availability and incentives. ``We've been patient. But our patience is wearing thin, and your refusal has cost all of us,`` he said, all but biting off his words. The unvaccinated minority ``can cause a lot of damage, and they are". The expansive rules mandate that all employers with more than 100 workers require them to be vaccinated or test for the virus weekly, affecting about 80 million Americans. And the roughly 17 million workers at health facilities that receive federal Medicare or Medicaid also will have to be fully vaccinated. Biden is also signing an executive order to require vaccination for employees of the executive branch and contractors who do business with the federal government with no option to test out. That covers several million more workers. Biden announced the new requirements in a Thursday afternoon address from the White House as part of a new ``action plan'' to address the latest rise in coronavirus cases and the stagnating pace of Covid-19 shots that has raised doubts among the public over his handling of the pandemic. Just two months ago Biden prematurely declared the nation's ``independence'' from the virus. Now, despite more than 208 million Americans having at least one dose of the vaccines, the US is seeing about 300% more new Covid-19 infections a day, about two-and-a-half times more hospitalisations, and nearly twice the number of deaths compared to the same time last year. "We are in the tough stretch and it could last for a while," Biden said of the current state of the pandemic. After months of using promotions to drive the vaccination rate, Biden is taking a much firmer hand, as he aides blamed people who have not yet received shots for the sharp rise in cases that is killing more than 1,000 people per day and imperiling a fragile economic rebound. In addition to the vaccination requirements, Biden moved to double federal fines for airline passengers who refuse to wear masks on flights or to maintain face covering requirements on federal property in accordance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. Biden announced that the federal government will work to increase the supply of virus tests, and that the White House has secured concessions from retailers including Walmart, Amazon, and Kroger to sell at-home testing kits at cost beginning this week. The administration was also sending additional federal support to assist schools in safely operating, including additional funding for testing. And Biden will call for large entertainment venues and arenas to require vaccinations or proof of a negative test for entry. The requirement for large companies to mandate vaccinations or weekly testing for employees will be enacted through a forthcoming rule from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration that carries penalties of $14,000 per violation, an administration official said. The White House did not immediately say when it would take effect, but said workers would have sufficient time to get vaccinated. The rule would also require that large companies provide paid time off for vaccination. Meanwhile, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services will extend a vaccination requirement issued earlier this summer for nursing home staff to other healthcare settings including hospitals, home-health agencies and dialysis centers. Separately, the Department of Health and Human Services will require vaccinations in Head Start Programs, as well as schools run by the Department of Defense and Bureau of Indian Education, affecting about 300,000 employees. Biden's order for executive branch workers and contractors includes exceptions for workers seeking religious or medical exemptions from vaccination, according to Psaki. Federal workers and contractors will have 75 days to get fully vaccinated. Workers who don't comply will be referred to their agencies' human resources departments for counseling and discipline, to include potential termination. ``We would like to be a model'' to other organizations and business around country, Psaki said of the federal workforce. An AP-NORC poll conducted in August found 55% of Americans in favor of requiring government workers to be fully vaccinated, compared with 21% opposed. Similar majorities also backed vaccine mandates for health care workers, teachers working at K-12 schools and workers who interact with the public, as at restaurants and stores. Biden has encouraged Covid-19 vaccine requirements in settings like schools, workplaces and university campuses, and the White House hopes the strengthened federal mandate will inspire more businesses to follow suit. On Thursday, the Los Angeles Board of Education was expected to vote on requiring all students 12 and older to be fully vaccinated in the the nation's second-largest school district. Walmart, the nation's largest private employer, said in late July it was requiring that all workers at its headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas, as well as its managers who travel within the US be vaccinated against COVID-19 by Oct. 4. But the company stopped short of requiring shots for its frontline workers. CVS Health said in late August it would require certain employees who interact with patients to be fully vaccinated by the end of October. That includes nurses, care managers and pharmacists. In the government, several federal agencies have previously announced vaccine requirements for much of their staffs, particularly those in healthcare roles like the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Pentagon moved last month to require all servicemembers to get vaccinated. Combined, the White House estimates those requirements cover 2.5 million Americans. Thursday's order is expected to impact nearly 2 million more federal workers and potentially millions of contractors. Biden's measures should help, but what's really needed is a change in mindset for many people, said Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, vice dean at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore. ``There is an aspect to this now that has to do with our country being so divided,'' said Sharfstein. ``This has become so politicized that people can't see the value of a vaccination that can save their lives. Our own divisions are preventing us from ending a pandemic.'' American Federation of Government Employees, the largest union of federal employees, said that while it strongly encourages vaccinations, workers should have a say in new mandates affecting them. ``Put simply, workers deserve a voice in their working conditions,'' said national President Everett Kelley. ``We expect to bargain over this change prior to implementation, and we urge everyone who is able to get vaccinated as soon as they can do so.'' Larry Cosme, president of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, called the mandate for federal workers ``ill conceived,`` saying, ``Vaccination should be promoted through education and encouragement - not coercion.'' More than 177 million Americans are fully vaccinated against the coronavirus, but confirmed cases have shot up in recent weeks to an average of about 140,000 per day with on average about 1,000 deaths, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most of the spread and the vast majority of severe illness and death is occurring among those not yet fully vaccinated. So-called breakthrough infections in vaccinated people occur, but tend to be far less dangerous. Federal officials are moving ahead with plans to begin administering booster shots of the mRNA vaccines to bolster protection against the more transmissible delta variant. Last month Biden announced plans to make them available beginning on September 20, but only the Pfizer vaccine will likely have received regulatory approval for a third dose by that time. Officials are aiming to administer the booster shots about eight months after the second dose of the two-dose vaccines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/sweeping-new-vaccine-mandates-for-100-million-americans/articleshow/86083323.cms||---

The incident took place around 8.30pm on Monday when 61-year-old Jitender Rana, retired sub-inspector, asked the cab driver to change the position of side-view mirror, according to a PCR call received at the Hauz Khas police station. The driver, identified by cops as Raj Kumar (34) from Nangloi, was arrested on Wednesday. “I booked a cab from Rajouri Garden on Monday. The driver was reckless and was almost going to hit a roadside vendor and a motorcyclist. I thought he must be drunk. When the cab reached near Nehru Place, he started driving even more recklessly. My house is barely a kilometre away,” Rana told TOI on Wednesday. “However, things turned ugly. He thought I was ‘lecturing’ him on reckless driving. He stopped the car and asked all of us to get out his cab. He then suddenly attacked me with a knife. My minor daughter and wife started crying. Some locals intervened and snatched his knife. I collapsed,” he said. “I never imagined that I would land up in a hospital with stab wounds after being attacked by a cabbie. I will try to avoid booking cabs.” After the PCR call, a team reached the spot to find that the injured man had already been rushed to AIIMS, police said. “Our team then went to the hospital and found that the injured man, 61-year-old Jitender Rana, a resident of Malviya Nagar, is a retired sub-inspector of Delhi Police. Initial probes revealed that Rana along with his wife and daughter had booked an Uber cab and were coming from Rajouri Garden during which he had some heated arguments with the driver over adjusting the side-view mirror,” said a senior police officer. During arguments, the driver suddenly attacked Rana with a knife, police said, adding locals overpowered the driver. Rana sustained stab wounds to his abdomen. His condition is stable, police said. The cab driver has been arrested and a case of attempt to murder has been registered against him at the Hauz Khas police station, DCP (south) Atul Thakur said. When contacted, an Uber spokesperson said, “What has been described is deplorable and something that no one should ever go through. We are ready to support law enforcement agencies in their investigation. The driver’s access to the app has been removed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/asked-to-adjust-side-view-mirror-cabbie-stabs-ex-cop/articleshow/86083415.cms||---

While dismissing the PIL, the court observed that public health and safety is to be given paramount importance and there is no reason to interfere with the restrictions imposed by the state government preventing celebrations in public places. One Siddineni Sree Satya Saibabu, who is the Krishna district secretary of Viswa Hindu Parishad, moved the high court challenging the instructions issued by the Krishna district collector directing officials not to give permission for setting up of Ganesh pandals in public places. Arguing on behalf of the petitioner, advocate Narasimha Rao Gudiseva told the bench headed by Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice Ninala Jayasurya that the directions given by the collector are contrary to the GO issued by the state government relaxing Covid-19 restrictions and opening schools, colleges and other commercial establishments. The order also stated that marriages, functions and religious congregations can be conducted with 150 people by duly following Covid-19 guidelines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/pil-seeking-ganesh-pandals-at-public-places-dismissed-by-ap-hc/articleshow/86077435.cms||Srikanth Aluri

---||World||US doubling fines for travelers not wearing masks||WASHINGTON: The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is doubling fines for first-time offenders who fail to wear masks, effective Friday, and said repeat offenders could face fines as high as $3,000. The White House said President Joe Biden was directing the higher fines to "ensure that masking requirements remain in place on the other modes of transportation as we continue to battle Covid-19." TSA said the new fines will "be $500-$1,000 for first offenders and $1,000-$3,000 for second offenders." Biden told reporters at the White House "TSA will double the fines on travelers that refuse to mask. If you break the rules be prepared to pay. And by the way, show some respect." He criticized the anger shown by some passengers toward flight attendants and others for enforcing mask requirements. "It's wrong. It's ugly," Biden said. Last month, TSA extended requirements for travelers to wear masks on airplanes, trains and buses and at airports and train stations through Jan. 18 to address ongoing Covid-19 risks. The regulations had been set to expire Sept. 13. TSA Administrator David Pekoske said "by doubling the range of penalties, we seek to reinforce the importance of voluntary adherence." TSA said that operators throughout the transportation network have reported over 4,000 face mask-related incidents. To date, almost 4,000 warning notices have been sent and 126 have been referred for civil penalty. TSA said in January that first-time incidents would start at $250 for failing to wear masks. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued much higher fines for not wearing masks on airplanes and for other disruptive behavior. The FAA has proposed penalties totaling more than $1 million, including many $9,000 fines for not wearing masks on airplanes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-doubling-fines-for-travelers-not-wearing-masks/articleshow/86083727.cms||---
---||India||'Eyes in sky': Centre clears project worth Rs 10,990 crore to build 6 'early-warning' aircraft||NEW DELHI: The government has given the final nod to the mega Rs 10,990 crore indigenous project to build six AEW&C (airborne early-warning and control) aircraft, which are critical in modern warfare as powerful “eyes in the sky”, to bolster the IAF’s surveillance capability along the borders with China and Pakistan. Sources said the DRDO project, which will entail mounting indigenous 360-degree coverage AESA (active electronically scanned array) radars on six Airbus-321 passenger aircraft to be acquired from the existing Air India fleet, was approved by the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) on Wednesday. Chaired by PM Narendra Modi, the CCS had also cleared the long-pending Airbus-Tata project to build 56 C-295 medium transport aircraft at a cost of over Rs 21,000 crore (around $3 billion), as was reported by TOI. Read AlsoIndia plans major indigenous project for six powerful 'eyes in the sky' AWACSNEW DELHI: India plans to launch a major Rs 10,500 crore project to indigenously develop six airborne warning and control system (AWACS) aircraft, which act as powerful “eyes in the sky” to look deep into enemy territory in modern-day warfare. Defence sources on Wednesday said the project, whichThe AEW&C project, which was accorded the initial “acceptance of necessity” by the defence ministry in December last year, is especially crucial because both Pakistan and China are far ahead of India in this arena. Under the project, the first flight trial of the AEW&C aircraft is now expected to take place in four years, with the entire project being completed in seven years. IAF currently has just three Israeli Phalcon AWACS mounted on Russian IL-76 transport aircraft, with 360-degree radar coverage at a 400-km range. It also has two indigenous “Netra” AEW&C aircraft, with indigenous 240-degree coverage radars with a 250-km range, fitted on smaller Brazilian Embraer-145 jets. “The new AEW&C aircraft will be a major upgrade on the Netra in terms of 360-degree coverage and longer range. The narrow-body A-321 planes will be bought from Air India at a much cheaper rate and then modified with the help of Airbus to fit the indigenous radars and other equipment. Their entire maintenance and service will be in India,” said a source. AEW&C or AWACS aircraft can detect incoming fighters, cruise missiles and drones much before ground-based radars, direct friendly fighters during air combat with enemy jets, and keep tabs on enemy troop build-ups and warships. As was reported by TOI earlier, the IAF felt the operational necessity for more such aircraft during the aerial skirmish with Pakistani fighters in February 2019 after the cross-border Balakot air-strikes. The continuing military confrontation with China in eastern Ladakh has further accentuated the need. China has around 30 AEW&C aircraft, including Kong Jing-2000 “Mainring”, KJ-200 “Moth” and KJ-500 aircraft. Pakistan, in turn, has 8-10 Chinese Karakoram Eagle ZDK-03 AWACS and Swedish Saab-2000 AEW&C. The IAF’s five such aircraft, incidentally, are a crucial component of its integrated air command and control system (IACCS), the fully-automated air defence network with data links being progressively built to integrate the wide array of military radars with each other as well as with civilian radars to plug surveillance gaps in Indian airspace.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/eyes-in-sky-centre-clears-project-worth-rs-11-crore-to-build-6-early-warning-aircraft/articleshow/86083841.cms||Rajat Pandit

The weekly positivity rate is also declining and has stabilised below 3%. However, 35 districts — mostly in Kerala, along with some in Himachal Pradesh and the North East — are still reporting over 10% positivity. Besides, 30 districts have positivity rates ranging between 5% and 10%. Around 61% of the total active cases are being reported in Kerala, the only state with over one lakh active cases now. Officials say the second surge is still continuing though restricted to limited areas and public health response should be guided accordingly, particularly in view of the upcoming festival season. The Centre has once again urged people to take precautions and avoid crowds. “The districts where positivity rate is high need to observe district level restrictions till positivity comes below 5%,” ICMR director Balram Bhargava said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/hotspots-shrink-from-58-in-july-districts-with-100-daily-cases-come-down-to-3/articleshow/86084124.cms||---

According to the Central Water Commission (CWC), the water level in the three rivers, though above the danger mark, is falling at a slow pace and will take a week or so to slide below the danger level. Also, the floodwaters have been receding fast in the basins of all other rivers. The Kosi was flowing 1.61m above the danger level at Baltara in Khagaria district and 59cm at Kursela in whose vicinity the Kosi falls in the Ganga. As to the water discharge through the Birpur barrage across Kosi, its level was 1.53 lakh cusecs in the morning, but rose to 1.61 lakh cusecs in the afternoon due to rainfall received in its catchment areas in Nepal. Similarly, the Bagmati was flowing 1.07m above the danger level at Benibad and 1.04m at Hayaghat in Muzaffarpur district. Otherwise, all along its downstream, the river was flowing below the danger level on Thursday. On the other hand, the Burhi Gandak was flowing 1.32m above the red mark near Samastipur railway bridge, 1.95m near Rosera railway bridge and 1m at Khagaria. The water discharge through Valmikinagar barrage across the Gandak fell from 1.39 lakh cusecs in the morning to 1.36 lakh cusecs in the afternoon. Meanwhile, the flood bulletin released by the water resources department said light to moderate rainfall would occur in south Bihar over the next three days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/3-rivers-still-above-danger-mark-at-different-places/articleshow/86076335.cms||Abhay Singh

His son Shubhanand Mukesh lit the funeral pyre. Singh’s body was first taken to his native place Dhuwai, nearly 25km away from Kahalgaon, where a large number of people paid tributes to the departed leader. Singh, 76, had been elected to Bihar legislative assembly nine times from Kahalgaon in Bhagalpur. He had also served as the Speaker of Bihar Vidhan Sabha and a cabinet minister. Senior political leaders, cutting across party lines, were present during the cremation. They included Congress state incharge Bhakta Charan Das, secretary incharge Birendra Rathore, Congress legislative party leaders Ajit Sharma and state president Madan Mohan Jha, Union minister of state Ashwani Choubey, JD(U) MLA Gopal Mandal and BJP leader Pawan Mishra. Das described Singh’s death as a big loss for the party as well as the country. “He was a leader of national stature and a guardian for many in Bihar,” Das said. Union minister Choubey recalled his over five-decade relation with Singh. “He had never let politics affect personal relations. His death has left a vacuum,” Choubey said. Former state DGP Ashish Ranjan Sinha said Singh’s death was a big loss for the people of Bihar. “He was a great human being who always helped the needy. He had shown his mettle as the Speaker of assembly where he dealt with diverse political parties with aplomb and absolute impartiality,” Sinha added.

Interestingly, the number of cases in the city dropped despite higher testing. The BMC Covid update said 48,000-plus tests were conducted for the second consecutive day in the run-up to the Ganpati festival. The state added 4,219 cases and 55 deaths, taking the total caseload to 64.9 lakh and fatalities to 1.4 lakh. According to the health department’s update, the cumulative cases in the state dipped by 15,066 and the total discharges dropped by 15,793 due to reconciliation. Duplicate entries were deleted which led to the drop in numbers. Active cases in the state crossed the 50,000 mark but dropped in Mumbai to 4,298. Dr Shashank Joshi, member of the state Covid task force, said the city’s Covid graph is steady at the moment and the test positivity rate is around 1%. “We have been steadily unlocking and there is a small rise in the number of cases,” he said. The daily numbers are likely to remain low for the next few days as the Ganpati festival begins. “Very few people will want to get themselves tested for Covid at least for the next two to three days. Many will travel out of the city as well,” said a senior BMC doctor. There could be a rise in cases by Tuesday or Wednesday as people who put off testing will get tested. “But the rise won’t be sharp,” said the doctor. CM Uddhav Thackeray has appealed to the public to follow all Covid restrictions in a bid to reduce crowding to keep the spread of the infection in check. “Cases in many districts where the festival is celebrated in a big way are bound to see a rise. The only way to ensure that the rise does not overwhelm the health infrastructure is to follow restrictions,” said an official from the health department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-cases-rise-but-city-nos-drop-despite-higher-testing/articleshow/86078878.cms||---

In fact, the abnormal conditions did not just leave the young minds in turmoil, it also left a deep impression on senior citizens too with 16 percent people aged above 60 dealing with the fear of death. A survey was conducted by Saurashtra University (SU)’s psychology department on 1,845 people on the subject of suicidal tendency and fear of death by direct interaction, telephonic talk and google link. The study conducted by department head Yogesh Jogsan, assistant professor Hasmukh Chavda and student Nimisha Patel surveyed 450 teenagers, 630 youth, 414 people of middle aged and 351 older people above the age of 60 years. The survey found 15 percent teenagers, 11 percent youth, 4 percent middle age people and seven percent people above 60 years having suicidal tendencies. Fear of dying was observed in 7 percent teenagers, 9 percent youth, 5 percent middle age people and 16 percent senior citizens. “Our survey saw that the pandemic left a deep negative impression on teenagers and older people. While the older people are more fearful of death, the teenagers stare at a goal-less existence because of continued lockdown and economic slowdown. Hence, suicidal tendency is high among teenagers and youth,” Prof Jogsan told TOI. According to the survey, suicidal tendencies are more pronounced among men than women even though females are considered to be temperamentally more emotional. The survey explains the reason for this to be that the ratio of consultation for mental health is 32 percent less in men compared to women. Men do not open up with friends or doctors which lead them to suicidal thoughts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/death-stalks-pandemic-hit-young-minds/articleshow/86076770.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

Often called a workaholic by her contemporaries and friends, Dhumal came to Vadodara to pursue BA in painting and later went on to acquire MA in print making from the Faculty of Fine Art at MS University. Dhumal later went to study with Sir Stanley William Hayter at Atelier 17 in Paris on French government scholarship and also had a stint with famous printmaker, Krishna Reddy. She continued her art practice, both in print making and painting, even when she was working as a teacher at MS University. Serving as associate professor in the department of graphic arts and later as the professor and head of the department of painting, Dhumal left MSU in 2005. “She continued her work from her studio after leaving the university. Whenever we visited her, she would be busy working in her studio,” said Jyoti Bhatt, another renowned artist. Dhumal considered women as her core inspiration and tried depicting females in many forms through her work. Her works were featured in museums and several key galleries including Sakshi Gallery and Tao Art Gallery in Mumbai and even abroad. Dhumal has also received numerous awards and recognitions for her work. Dhumal made significant contribution to bring printmaking to the forefront of the art pedagogy and practice. “A close relationship exists between a printmaker and his prints. The serial nature of prints permits an artist to see and record the development of their ideas, figurative or abstract,” Dhumal, who believed that public and art lovers should be made aware that print is as relevant and original as a painting itself, had stated once.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/renowned-print-artist-rini-dhumal-passes-away-at-73/articleshow/86076323.cms||---

An order in this regard was issued by Patna district magistrate, (DM) Chandrashekhar Singh, during a meeting with SSP, Upendra Kumar Sharma, and representatives of the Dussehra Committee Trust on Thursday. The DM said, “Only a limited number of guests will attend the three important events — Ramleela, Ravan Vadh, and Bharat Milap — at Kalidas Rangalaya on October 14, 15, and 16 respectively.” Events like Ramleela, Ravan Vadh and Bharat Milap have been attracting a large number of audiences from different parts of the state for years. The Covid-19 pandemic, however, changed the situation completely. Earlier, the Dussehra Committee Trust had sought permission from the administration to conduct the three events at Gandhi Maidan, but their request was declined. Chandrashekhar told this reporter, “Permission for erecting Durga Puja pandals will be granted by the SDOs and SDPOs concerned. However, if the rate of Covid infections rises again, the district administration will immediately cancel all the events.” The 10-day Durga Puja will begin with ‘kalash sthapana’ on October 7 and conclude on October 15.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/dm-ravan-vadh-event-at-kalidas-rangalaya-this-year/articleshow/86079815.cms||VK Tripathi

This was decided at a high-level meeting held under the chairmanship of governor-cum-chancellor Phagu Chauhan at Raj Bhavan here on Thursday. The meeting was held at the initiative of the state government following the reports of removal of the ideas of JP and Lohia from the syllabi of JP university and other universities. It was attended by vice-chancellors of all the conventional universities in the state and top officials of the state education department. The chancellor’s secretariat discussed in detail the recent changes in the syllabi of political science and some other subjects of different universities. It was decided that the removed texts would be included in the syllabi again through prescribed procedure. Earlier, education minister Vijay Kumar Chaudhary had met the chancellor on Tuesday and held a detailed discussion with him on the issue. He had told the governor that removal of the thoughts and ideas of political and social thinkers like Loknayak Jai Prakash Narain and Ram Manohar Lohia from the syllabi has hurt the sentiment of the people of the state. These leaders have left an indelible imprint in the political thoughts of not only Bihar, but of the entire country. He had urged the governor to immediately intervene in the matter and take corrective measures. At the meeting, the vice-chancellors agreed to make necessary corrections in the syllabi through proper channels. They also agreed to get the syllabi of other subjects revised so that they become socially relevant. The changes would come into effect with the approval of the chancellor and the Bihar State Higher Education Council. Issues concerning timely assessment and accreditation of universities and colleges and appointment of principals and teachers were also discussed at the meeting. The minister thanked the governor for taking prompt action in convening the VC’s meeting and deciding the crucial issue in the best interest of the state and its people. Meanwhile, Patna University vice-chancellor Girish Kumar Chaudhary said the university is empowered to make up to 20% changes in the uniform syllabi approved by the chancellor’s secretariat. Under this provision, necessary changes in the syllabi would be made by the board of studies and the academic council of the university, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-varsities-to-include-thoughts-of-jp-lohia-in-syllabi-again/articleshow/86078096.cms||B K Mishra
---||Patna||Patna: Gang of fake cops busted, one arrested||PATNA: Police on Thursday claimed to have busted a gang involved in the extortion of money from sand-laden truck operators posing as cops in Patna rural. Acting on a tip-off, a team conducted a raid on Parsa Road under the Bihta police station area and took one Suraj Kumar alias Bhola in custody. The Paharpur resident was allegedly extorting money from the driver of a truck. During interrogation, Bhola revealed that his gang, which had 10-12 members, would wear police uniforms to dodge the truckers. He also disclosed that some of them kept tabs on the movement of patrol vehicles. On seeing a cop, they would hide in nearby buildings. Bhola told police the names of his associates, who managed to flee from the spot. “We have a list of all the members of the gang. They will be arrested soon,” a cop posted at the Bihta police station said, adding that the gang members were operating with such precision that the cops had no inkling of their movement. Bhola’s arrest is considered a big achievement for police as they had been receiving frequent complaints about his gang. Man held with Rs 39L: Patna SSP, Upendra Kumar Sharma, told reporters at a presser on Thursday that one Ravi Bhaskar was arrested and Rs 39.80 lakh recovered from his possession during a raid under the Kadamkuan police station area in Patna. The seized money was part of the Rs 57.49 lakh allegedly looted from the Exhibition Road office of a West Bengal-based private company on September 1. Ravi, stated to be an employee of the company, was the mastermind of the incident. “Raids are being conducted to arrest the other accused,” the SSP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/gang-of-fake-cops-busted-1-arrested/articleshow/86078147.cms||Ramashankar

Interestingly, the number of cases in the city dropped despite higher testing. The BMC Covid update said 48,000-plus tests were conducted for the second consecutive day in the run-up to the Ganpati festival. The state added 4,219 cases and 55 deaths, taking the total caseload to 64.9 lakh and fatalities to 1.4 lakh. According to the health department’s update, the cumulative cases in the state dipped by 15,066 and the total discharges dropped by 15,793 due to reconciliation. Duplicate entries were deleted which led to the drop in numbers. Active cases in the state crossed the 50,000 mark but dropped in Mumbai to 4,298. Dr Shashank Joshi, member of the state Covid task force, said the city’s Covid graph is steady at the moment and the test positivity rate is around 1%. “We have been steadily unlocking and there is a small rise in the number of cases,” he said. The daily numbers are likely to remain low for the next few days as the Ganpati festival begins. “Very few people will want to get themselves tested for Covid at least for the next two to three days. Many will travel out of the city as well,” said a senior BMC doctor. There could be a rise in cases by Tuesday or Wednesday as people who put off testing will get tested. “But the rise won’t be sharp,” said the doctor. CM Uddhav Thackeray has appealed to the public to follow all Covid restrictions in a bid to reduce crowding to keep the spread of the infection in check. “Cases in many districts where the festival is celebrated in a big way are bound to see a rise. The only way to ensure that the rise does not overwhelm the health infrastructure is to follow restrictions,” said an official from the health department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/maharashtra-cases-rise-but-city-nos-drop-despite-higher-testing/articleshow/86084784.cms||---

Garbage continued to spill over to the main streets threatening an epidemic in most of the places following the strike by over 40,000 sanitation workers, sweepers and grade four employees in 258 urban local bodies (ULBs) including 18 municipal corporations, 83 Nagar Parishads and 157 Nagar Panchayats, who are demanding regularisation of jobs, pay at par with other civic agency employees and jobs on compassionate ground. Morcha president Chandra Prakash said that strike in all civic bodies of the state continued successfully for the third day. “The employees are united this time. We will not call off the strike unless the government decides to fulfil our demands. We are fighting for the rights of contractual as well as permanent Group D employees,” he said. Addressing the striking workers at Maurya Lok complex here, Prakash said from September 10, group of workers would go to the offices of various political parties and submit a copy of their memorandum of demands. PMC commissioner Himanshu Sharma said despite limited resources, sanitation work continued on Thursday. “Outsourced staff have been deputed to clean the city during the day time, however, in the night hours, work was carried out through machines and task force,” he said. Kadamkuan resident Samant Kumar said, “Initially I thought that the problem would be sorted out in a day or two. But now I feel that the authorities or the state government must quickly find a solution especially during this pandemic time.” Anshu Sinha, a resident of Bahadurpur said, “A heap of garbage has been dumped in front of my house, which is increasing every day.

---||Business||SC orders NGT to decide on Nayara’s expansion afresh||Ahmedabad: The Supreme Court has quashed an order of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) by which it endorsed the environmental clearance for the expansion of Nayara Energy Ltd’s refinery capacity from 20 MMTPA to 46 MMTPA at Vadinar, with the strong observation that NGT cannot absolve itself from its duty to adjudicate environmental issues. After quashing the NGT order, the apex court ordered the tribunal to decide the appeal afresh on the challenge to the environment clearance accorded in January. The appeal before the SC was filed by one Zuber Sanghar, through advocate Purvish Malkan, questioning NGT’s June 7 order by which it upheld the environment clearance and decided to assign the task of scrutiny to an expert committee. The SC noted, “Constitution of an expert committee does not absolve the NGT of its duty to adjudicate. The adjudicatory function of NGT cannot be assigned to committees, even expert committees. The decision has to be that of the NGT. The NGT has been constituted as an expert adjudicatory authority under an Act of Parliament. The discharge of its functions cannot be obviated by tasking committees to carry out a function which vests in the tribunal.” Sanghar had approached the NGT with the grievance that the expansion of the refinery would cause an adverse impact on the marine environment – the mangroves and marine biology — as there is a marine national park nearby. The NGT disposed of Sanghar’s plaint and noted that its attention was drawn to the Environment Impact Assessment/Environment Management Plan prepared by CSIR-NEERI. The NGT also noted that all the environment clearance conditions would be duly complied with and due mitigation measures would be taken to ensure the safety of mangroves and marine environment. Sanghar raised the issue before the SC, which said, “The NGT has merely based its conclusion on the statement which has been made by the project proponent and has not conducted an independent appraisal of the grounds of challenge.” The NGT said the refinery was already in existence and there was no continuing grievance against its functioning so far as environmental norms are concerned. The SC said this observation would not resolve the grievance on whether the expansion of the project would have a deleterious impact on the environment or not.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sc-orders-ngt-to-decide-on-nayaras-expansion-afresh/articleshow/86080653.cms||---

Inflow of water, which was 1.43 lakh cusecs on Wednesday, increased to 2.23 lakh cusecs by 8pm on Thursday. Currently the dam level is at 337 ft. “There is a rise in inflow of water due to heavy rain in the catchment area of Ukai on Thursday. We will continue to fill the dam up to 340 ft and that level will be maintained till September 15. The water level will be further increased up to 345 ft till October 1,” said S R Mahakal, superintending engineer of Ukai circle. “Due to enough water in the reservoir, we will be able to supply water for irrigation in five districts of south Gujarat, drinking water to over 80 lakh population including that of Surat city and 112 industrial units. The water will be available throughout the year,” Mahakal added. Ukai water is the major source of drinking water supply for the population of Surat city while it supplies water for farming as well through a network of canals. Currently two mini hydro-power units, each of 2.5-megawatt capacity, are operational at the reservoir. If the water level increases further, the reservoir authorities will start four hydro-power units each of 75 megawatts capacity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/water-level-in-ukai-reservoir-rising/articleshow/86076677.cms||---

Though we are also collecting swab samples of the hospitalised children for Covid test, there has been no report of any positive case so far,” state health minister Mangal Pandey said on Thursday. Though the two important government hospitals of the state capital – Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) and Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH) – have admitted children exceeding the number of beds and all their paediatric and neonatal intensive care units are full, the minister said the rate of recovery from the viral fever was high and many were being discharged within days of admission. “There is nothing to worry,” he said. He said the PMCH, NMCH and other Patna-based hospitals were in touch with the health department on the issue of children’s ailments. Pandey added there was no shortage of medicines or injections in any government hospital. “However, the officials of the health department have been asked to keep in touch with the hospitals and make drugs, injections and other medical assistance available without delay. I am also in touch with paediatric experts to understand the problem and all necessary arrangements will be made to ensure fast recovery of children from this viral fever,” the minister said. Several hospitals had reported rise in cases of high fever, diarrhoea and pneumonia among children in the recent weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/viral-fever-cases-among-kids-teams-sent-to-two-districts/articleshow/86076117.cms||VK Tripathi

According to tourism minister, Narayan Prasad, the CM had inspected the ropeway site along with the managing director of the Bihar State Tourism Development Corporation and other senior officials on September 7. With eight cabins, each of which will accommodate four people simultaneously, the ropeway will cover the 760-metre-long distance in five minutes. “The cabin ropeway will attract more tourists and generate employment opportunities for the residents of Banka district,” the minister told this newspaper on Thursday. He pointed out that the officials of the department had been asked to promote the other tourist spots in Banka district. “They have also been instructed to complete the work on construction and renovation of the popular sites in the district,” Narayan said, adding that tourism in Bihar was being developed in a phased manner. The Skanda Purana says the Mandar Hill was used for churning the ocean to extract nectar from its bosom (‘Samudra Manthan’). Several artefacts have also been found near the hill over the years. Anantashutosh Dwivedi, the director general of the Bihar Heritage Society, said the archaeological site-cum-tourist destination was 700 feet high. “Many rare artefacts and inscriptions belonging to the post-Gupta period have been found there. One can also see sculptures on both sides while climbing the hill,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cabin-ropeway-at-mandar-hill-to-be-inaugurated-soon-minister/articleshow/86078260.cms||Faryal Rumi

---||Business||Ford exit could impact nearly 45,000-50,000 jobs||Chennai: Ford’s decision to shut down manufacturing in India will impact nearly 45,000 to 50,000 jobs including its own assembly lines as well as at vendor factories, dealerships and workshops. The company said that it employs nearly 4,000 people, directly, at its factories who will have to go. The silver lining will be a separation scheme which could offer some financial solace. “Ford will work closely with employees, unions, suppliers, dealers, government, and other stakeholders in Chennai and Sanand to develop a fair and balanced plan to mitigate the effects of the decision,” the company said in a statement. But beyond the assembly line, the hit is much bigger. “There are around 170 dealers who in-turn have around 391 outlets and have invested around Rs 2,000 crore setting up their dealerships. These dealerships employ around 40,000 people — what happens to them?,” said FADA (auto dealers body) president Vinkesh Gulati. Even in the plant, the severance package is not likely to be very lavish. Ford employs around 2,000 odd people in its Maraimalainagar factory. Union sources say the severance settlement being discussed is likely to be around Rs 6-8 lakh per person which works out to a year's wages. Ford India MD & president Anurag Mehrotra said that the company will “retain 100% of dealer partners in the service network” and work with “potential buyers to make sure the deal covers both assets and employees”. However, that hasn’t mitigated the uncertainty over job losses. Ford has clarified that the 11,000 people employed at the Ford Business Solutions will continue and this business will be ramped up. Besides, more than 500 employees at the Sanand Engine plant will continue to make engines for the global Ranger pickup and 100 employees will support parts distribution and customer service. Beyond this, a section of employees will be needed for the transition till mid-next year but the rest will “be separated with an equitable and fair package,” said Mehrotra. The company will use the Smart Mobility business and Ford Business Solutions to place additional employees, he added. The company will start talking to its union and employees from next week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ford-exit-could-impact-nearly-45000-50000-jobs/articleshow/86079941.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta
---||Patna||Is Patna University out of BSEB students’ league?||PATNA: Students of the Bihar School Examination Board (BSEB), who had passed their Class XII exams recently, may find it difficult to get an entry into Patna University. As a result of the allotment of marks to the candidates of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) on the basis of internal evaluation at the school level, the BSEB students scored less than others. Now, they are in a dilemma because PU has decided to admit new students on the basis of their marks. Arida Hassan, a science student of Khizarsarai-based Rampyari High School, had scored 72.7% in her Class XII exams. The girl, who comes from a humble background, had always dreamt of studying at Magadh Mahila College. However, her “low” percentage has shattered all her hopes. “Unlike the students of the CBSE and the CISCE, the BSEB candidates wrote their Class XII exams. PU should have considered this and given the rankings accordingly,” Arida told TOI and added, “With my 11,000th rank, it is impossible for me to get admission in any PU college.” A commerce student, Sugandha Kumari, urged PU to conduct an entrance test for “fair admissions”. “Although I scored 94.2% in Class XII, there are many CBSE and CISCE students who got better marks than me without taking any exam,” she rued. According to sources, the CBSE toppers got 98.6% (science), 98.8% (arts), and 99% (commerce) in Class XII. Their CISCE counterparts got 99.75% (science), 98.75% (arts), and 99.25% (commerce). However, the BSEB toppers scored 94.2% in all the three streams this year. This clearly indicates that there was a huge gap in the marks obtained by the toppers of the three boards. The vice-chancellor of PU, Girish Kumar Chaudhary, pointed out that the university was giving preference to those who had scored more, irrespective of the board they belonged to. “We are not authorised to give extra marks to the BSEB students,” he claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/is-pu-out-of-bseb-students-league/articleshow/86076130.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Notre Dame Academy teacher Abha Chaudhary said that the current year’s sample papers are different from the previous ones. “The whole year has been divided into two parts. The first-term examinations, which will be conducted soon and have multiple-choice questions, will include 50% of the entire syllabi,” she said, adding that all the questions are based on case studies and observations. Another teacher, Balram Singh of DAV-BSEB, said, “Due to the pandemic, the government has reduced the syllabus. It will be beneficial for the slow learners as the sample papers will help them study well for the exams.” St Michael’s High School teacher R S Pandey informed that the school is planning to conduct the first-term examination in objective format. “The second one will be in subjective form,” he said. International School student Rasmika Raj observed that the sample papers are different from the last few years. She said it will help her get an idea about the questions to prepare accordingly for the exams. Kshitij Raj of Loyola High School is also happy with the new pattern of the sample papers. “I just need some practice to score well in the exams,” he said.

PMCH superintendent Dr I S Thakur said while the hospital was being developed into a world-class health institution, the facility of corneal transplant to restore vision to those who lost sight due to different reasons should be strengthened. “As people’s participation in such initiative largely depends on counselling and awareness, doctors and staff of the hospital could play an important role by convincing the attendants and family members of trauma patients to agree for eye donation,” Dr Thakur said. Head of the hospital’s eye department, Dr Nageshwar Sharma, said only the cornea of a dead person is retrieved for transplant. He said soon after the retrieval of cornea within six hours, the transplant unit makes phone calls to the registered seekers asking them to rush for transplant. The simple rule of transplant is ‘earlier the better’. However, the maximum period of transplant is 14 days of retrieval of cornea,” he said. “At least 200 people, including 50 PMCH doctors and health staff, have submitted their pledge for corneal retrieval. Since its establishment in August 2018, the eye department of the hospital has successfully carried out 62 corneal transplants,” Dr Sharma added.

The police said they were searching for her accomplice, who had procured the external device used in the crime. “Beny Nantongo (26), who also uses several aliases, including Blessing, Sandra and Alexandra, among others, was arrested from a flat in Gurugram after her involvement came to the fore during the interrogation of two Nigerian nationals — David Charles Alies Ugochukwu Charles Nwachukwu (30) and Kahinde Sadiq Idris (29) — arrested earlier from Undri in connection with these thefts,” senior inspector D S Hake told TOI.  Inspector Minal Patil, who was part of the police team that arrested Nantongo from Gurugram, said, “We recovered CCTV footage from the ATMs targeted by the woman and her accomplices. Later, we arrested her accomplices. We established her identity after questioning the duo. However, she was constantly on the move. We received confirmed information and finally arrested her in Gurugram.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cops-trace-nigerian-woman-heading-atm-cash-theft-gang-to-gurugram/articleshow/86081270.cms||---
---||Business||Advent nears Rs 5,000cr deal to buy SP-owned Eureka Forbes||Reeba Zachariah & Nandini Sengupta Mumbai/Chennai: American private equity firm Advent International is nearing a deal to acquire Eureka Forbes, India’s largest maker of water purifiers and vacuum cleaners owned by the Shapoorji Pallonji (SP) Group. The transaction is set to value Eureka Forbes at about Rs 5,000 crore, said people with knowledge of the matter. SP had appointed Standard Chartered Bank to explore strategic options for Eureka Forbes, which is being demerged from the publicly listed Forbes & Co. The demerger is pending approval from the National Company Law Tribunal. After this, the consumer appliances unit would be sold to Advent. When contacted, both Advent and SP offered no comment. The transaction will help SP pare its Rs 20,000-crore total debt and sharpen focus on its core construction business. Of the total debt, about Rs 12,000 crore is under the Reserve Bank of India’s Covid relief scheme. This scheme gives SP time till 2023 to clear the dues, but it plans to repay at least half of it in the coming months. And the divestment of Eureka Forbes is in that direction. Besides Eureka Forbes, SP is looking to sell Sterling & Wilson Solar, Afcons Infrastructure and some real estate assets. Advent was competing with investment firm Warburg Pincus and Swedish home appliance manufacturer Electrolux to acquire Eureka Forbes. Both declined to raise their offers, paving the way for the impending deal with Advent. Interestingly, Eureka Forbes, one of the world’s largest direct sales companies, was promoted by Electrolux along with the Tata Group in the early 1980s. The Swedish major exited the joint venture as it had got out of direct marketing business in several countries. Advent’s move follows its exit from home appliance maker Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals. The Boston-based fund has been investing in India since 2007. In this time, it has deployed more than $1.7 billion in a dozen Indian companies, according to its February 7 statement. Eureka Forbes, with a footprint in over 35 countries, has a customer count of 20 million. Some years ago, it acquired Switzerland’s Lux, which helped Eureka Forbes to spread its wings in foreign locations. It is a leader in the vacuum-cleaning category in India and its flagship brand Aquaguard too has a dominant share of the water purifier market in the country. Riding on the hygiene and health wave on the back of the pandemic, it recently launched Forbes Coronaguard, a virus disinfectant device, and robotic vacuum cleaners.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/advent-nears-rs-5000cr-deal-to-buy-sp-owned-eureka-forbes/articleshow/86081110.cms||Reeba Zachariah
---||Patna||NIRF ranking: IIT-Patna 51st in ‘overall’ category||PATNA: The Indian Institute of Technology-Patna (IIT-P) moved up three notches in “overall” category and secured the 51st rank in the country among the higher education institutes as per the National Institute Ranking Framework (NIRF) report released on Thursday. The institute’s ranking in the “engineering” category has also improved from 26th in 2020 to 21st this year. The IIT-P has scored 47.67 out of 100 in “overall category”. In the “engineering” category, it has scored 57.38 as compared to 55.74 in 2020. The institute has also bagged the 47th rank in the newly introduced “research” category among the top 50 institutes in the country. The NIRF report was released by Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan. The ranking framework of the institutions across the country was done under five broad parameters – teaching, learning and resources (TLR), research and professional practice (RP), graduation outcome (GO), outreach and inclusivity (OI) and perception (PR). Ranks are assigned based on the total sum of marks. Rishi Raj, associate dean (resources) of IIT-P, said they have been analysing the institute’s performance every year in various fields since 2006 and trying to figure out where they are lagging. “We are focusing more on researches. The IIT-P need to work more on two parameters – OI and perception,” he said. Only four higher education institutes in Bihar have figured in the NIRF 2021 report – IIT-P in three categories, National Institute of Technology-Patna (NIT-P) in engineering category, Chandragupta Institute of Management-Patna (CIMP) in management category and Patna Women’s College (PWC) in college category. No institute from the state has figured in pharmacy, university, dental, law, medical and architect categories. NIT-P has secured 72nd rank with 42.06 score. The institute has scored 54.46 in TLR, 24.3 in RP, 61.86 in GO, 50.78 in OI and 9.87 in perception. Institute’s director PK Jain said their major emphasis is on intellectual property resource (IPR), which includes patent, copyright and start-ups, and secondly, researches. He added: “At several sub-parameters, things are beyond our hands like students’ intake, ratio of female and male candidates and diversity. Very few students from other parts of the country apart from eastern region, wish to take admission in Bihar.” CIMP has figured in the rank band between 76-100 and PWC between 101-150. Sanjay Kumar, additional chief secretary of state education department, said many factors counted in rankings. “Only few higher education institutions achieve national ranking. Many from the state had failed to apply. We have asked the heads of several institutions to go for the NIRF ranking from the next year,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nirf-ranking-iit-p-51st-in-overall-category/articleshow/86076042.cms||Faryal Rumi

Leader of opposition in state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav reiterated at a public meeting at Baikunthpur in Gopalganj district on Thursday that the RJD would wrest both Tarapur and Kusheshwar Asthan seats from the JD(U) in the byelection. “We lost both the seats by thin margins in the assembly polls held last year. In fact, our candidates had won the election but were denied certificates under a well-hatched conspiracy,” he said, adding the situation in the byelection would be different. “The workers of the party have been asked to work hard and thwart the sinister designs of the ruling alliance,” he said. The JD(U), however, dismissed the RJD leader’s claim and exuded confidence that the two seats would again go into its kitty. Senior JD(U) leader and social welfare department minister Madan Sahni said Tejashwi had no idea about the ground reality. “The RJD will again bite the dust,” he told reporters on the sidelines of his ‘janata darbar’ at the JD (U) office here. Tarapur assembly seat fell vacant after the death of JD(U) MLA Mewalal Choudhary. The death of JD(U) MLA Shashibhushan Hazari necessitated the bypoll in Kusheshwar Asthan in Darbhanga district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rjd-to-bite-the-dust-in-byelection-jdu/articleshow/86078845.cms||Ramashankar

They adorned themselves with ‘solah shringar’ and worshipped Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati. According to a priest, Bhola Pandey, Teej is primarily celebrated in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh on the third day of the first fortnight of the month of Bhadra. Women break their fast on the next day with ‘paran’. Pratima Devi, a resident of Shastri Nagar, told this newspaper, “I will get ready in the evening and offer items like ‘alta’, mehndi, mirror, comb, vermilion, and ‘bindi’ to the deities.” Another married woman, Poonam Devi, who lives in Patliputra Colony, will perform the puja together with her friends. Women also prepare ‘gujiyas’ and ‘thekuas’ on the occasion. A Gola Road resident, Aarti Singh, said she had cooked different delicacies using pure ghee a day before the fast. “I will distribute the ‘prasad’ among my neighbours, acquaintances, and family members,” she added. Some working women, who did not get time to prepare ‘gujiyas’ at home, bought them from different confectioneries in the city. Sudha Kumari, a resident of Boring Road, claimed, “Making ‘gujiyas’ is a hectic task. I, therefore, purchased them from a nearby shop.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/teej-women-will-break-fast-today/articleshow/86078637.cms||---
---||Business||Kotak Bank cuts home loan rate to 6.5%||Mumbai: Kotak Mahindra Bank, one of the leading private sector lenders in India, on Thursday said it would cut the interest rate on home loans from 6.65% to 6.5% — the lowest in the industry. This will be applicable for all loan amounts for salaried people, for both new and balance transfer cases and valid for two months from September 10 to November 8. With system liquidity at its highest ever at more than Rs 9 lakh crore, banks are increasingly looking at low-risk lending products in which they could cut the rate of interest to get more customers. Kotak Bank continues to offer one of the most competitive rates in the home loan industry, the lender said through a release. “This special rate is available across all loan amounts and is linked to a borrower’s credit profile,” it said. Kotak Bank, a relatively new entrant in the home loan segment, has been offering one of the lowest mortgage rates in the industry since it started.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/kotak-bank-cuts-home-loan-rate-to-6-5/articleshow/86080959.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad records 30% spike in suicides compared to 2020||AHMEDABAD: On Tuesday and Wednesday, 10 people ended their lives in Ahmedabad. While seven died by suicide on Tuesday, three killed themselves on Wednesday. In South Bopal, a man who was in financial distress consumed poison. On getting to know of his son’s death, his father hanged himself. While the year 2020 was the ‘year of pandemic’ for India and Gujarat, experts term 2021 as the ‘year of despair’. The country, including Gujarat, saw the peak of the pandemic, a large population also started experiencing the long-term effects of Covid-19 in areas ranging from interpersonal relationships to financial stability. This has translated into a higher number of suicides, revealed statistics by the city police. According to figures, the city recorded suicides of 542 persons between January and August in 2020. In the same period, 687 people ended their lives this year. To put the figure in perspective, 763 suicides were recorded in the entire year of 2019, whereas the figure was 808 in 2020. This means that on an average, 3 (2.8) people died by suicide daily in the city. Analysis of the figures reveal that the rise in male suicide was 34% compared to 10% in female suicide. The overall rise was about 30%, said senior city police officials. It’s not just the police figures that reflect this rise. The Ahmedabad Fire and Emergency Services figures reveal that from January to August this year, they recorded the deaths of 106 persons and rescued 24 persons. In comparison, they recorded the deaths of 113 persons and the rescue of 29 in the entire year of 2020. This begs the question: what is pushing citizens to the brink? Dr Ajay Chauhan, medical superintendent of the Hospital for Mental Health (HMH), said that four out of every 10 persons in OPDs this year complain of depression and stress. “Many of these patients admitted to having suicidal thoughts. As this year’s theme proclaims, the need of the hour is creating hope through action. We need to reach out to these persons in need by identifying signs early and assuring them that they can talk about their issues and that there are other ways to deal with it,” said Dr Chauhan. Pravin Valera, coordinator of Jeevan Aastha helpline, said that compared to 14,000 calls between January and August last year, this year’s tally has already reached 19,000 – a rise of about 36%. “The pattern of calls has changed, too. Last year, we fielded a lot of distress calls from students worried about their studies and future. But this year around, a large chunk of calls are about monetary issues, loss of job, loss of loved ones and depression caused by interpersonal relationships,” said Valera. “The message of this day is never to lose hope and find the brighter side.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ahmedabad-records-30-spike-in-suicides-compared-to-2020/articleshow/86080344.cms||Parth Shastri

During the 10-day festival, they will keep their houses clean, perform different rituals, and offer ‘modaks’ to Ganpati Bappa. An A G Colony resident, Raut Kavita Anil, has illuminated her house with colourful lights to welcome Lord Ganesh. She told this reporter on Thursday, “My family and I look forward to celebrating Vinayak Utsav every year. We clean every corner of the house and decorate it beautifully.” Sanjay Bhosle, the secretary of Maharashtra Mandal, said his kids were more excited to celebrate the festival. “I will install an idol of Lord Ganesh in my house too,” he added. In view of the Covid-19 pandemic, Sangeeta Bhosle, who lives in Bakarganj, will keep the celebrations “simple”. “With Ganpati Bappa’s blessings, we are safe and sound. What else do we need?,” she asked. Calling Lord Ganesh a member of his family, another Bakarganj resident, Santosh Shankar Pawar, said, “We will welcome him with open arms and prepare ‘modaks’ and other delicacies.” Santosh’s neighbour, Vijay Vishnu Patil, has got a small pandal erected on the premises of his house and decorated it with flowers and lights. “We will install Bappa’s idol in the morning and follow all the rituals religiously,” he claimed. Many non-Marathis have also decided to worship Lord Ganesh during the 10-day Vinayak Utsav and pray for the betterment of the world.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/devotees-get-ready-for-vinayak-utsav/articleshow/86078712.cms||---

BSPCB chairman Ashok Ghosh said samples of water were collected after the bodies were found floating in the Ganga during the peak of second wave of Covid pandemic in May and June this year. “It was a relief that none of the samples collected had traces of SARS-CoV2. It means that the water was not contaminated by the bodies of Covid-19 victims. However, there are impurities in the Ganga river due to other man-made reasons,” Ghosh added. “The team collected the Ganga water samples in two phases from several districts of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. The samples were sent to CSIR-IITR Lucknow for test as we do not have such facilities in our lab. The report of the study will be officially released in couple of days by the CPCB. However, the main finding is that the water had not been contaminated because of the recovery of bodies,” Ghosh said. According to officials, the panel formed by the central government collected samples from the Ganga in Buxar on June 1 and in Patna, Bhojpur and Saran on June 5. In Patna, the samples were collected from Digha Ghat and Gai Ghat. The study was conducted in two phases by the scientists. RT-PCR test was done to determine the viral load on the water body after the extraction of the ribonucleic acid (RNA) of the viruses from the collected samples of water. The study also checked the biological characteristics of the river. D K Paul, associate professor of department of zoology and post-coordinator of MSc environmental science and management, Patna University (PU), said the coronavirus usually effects the respiratory system. “If people do not take water in their mouth and nose, they do not need to be afraid. Even if the water is contaminated at a permissible limit, it will not affect the people,” he said. Arbind Kumar, head of PG department of zoology, PU, said a little amount of contamination of water would occur on the banks of the river as the corpses of Covid-19 victims were left without burial. “The concentration of the virus in water was diluted because of the continuous flow of the Ganga river,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/no-trace-of-coronavirus-in-ganga-waters-finds-study/articleshow/86076477.cms||Faryal Rumi

Station house officer (Haridwar city police station) Amarjeet Singh, who is part of the Special Investigation Team (SIT) probing the scam, told TOI that directors of Max Corporate Services, Sharat Pant and Malika Pant, as well as Dr Navtej Nalwa of Haryana-based Nalwa Laboratories, have been declared proclaimed offenders under section 82 of the CrPC by the chief judicial magistrate court. A proclaimed offender may be arrested by any police officer without any order from a magistrate and without a warrant.“Their properties will be attached soon,” Singh said, adding that teams have been sent to their registered residential addresses to paste court notices. Several raids were conducted by police over the past few days but none of the accused could be traced. In July, the SIT had arrested Ashish Vashisth, director of Delphia labs, which had a tie-up with another lab allegedly involved in the scam. The SIT found that Max Corporate Services, which was not approved by the ICMR, had signed an MoU with Nalwa Labs and Dr Lalchandani Labs to become eligible as one of the agencies for conducting tests during the Kumbh. But when it came down to on-ground testing, Nalwa labs said it did not have sufficient manpower and signed another agreement with Delphia labs to provide staff to conduct the actual testing and upload the reports, the SIT found. Delphia labs had allegedly conducted fake tests and provided staff to upload forged test reports on the ICMR portal. A detailed investigation by the health department had found that nearly a lakh fake tests were conducted in Kumbh in April. In one instance, a single phone number was used to register over 50 people while one antigen test kit (which has an exclusive number and is meant for single use) was shown to have tested 700 samples.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/kumbh-covid-scam-court-declares-3-key-accused-proclaimed-offenders/articleshow/86076500.cms||MS Nawaz

---||Chandigarh||Disagreement with CM on appointment: Vij says went by rulebook||Gurgaon: Home minister Anil Vij on Wednesday asked the Gurgaon police to improve public relations and directed senior police officers to hold regular meetings with prominent citizens of respective areas to develop a mechanism to resolve complaints. Later, speaking to reporters on his clash of opinions with Manohar Lal Khattar on the appointment of an IPS officer as the transport secretary, Vij reiterated that his objections were in accordance with established rules but said that the CM had the power to overrule him. In fact, Vij had pointed out that the post of the principal secretary (transport) is reserved for an IAS officer and recommended that an opinion be sought from the department of personnel and training (DOPT). However, Khattar overruled Vij to appoint IPS Kala Ramachandran as the principal secretary (transport). “My objections were in accordance with the rules, but it was overruled by the CM. As the head of the state, the chief minister has the power to take decisions,” the home minister told reporters. Earlier the home minister and the chief minister had differences over giving an extension to former DGP Manoj Yadav. After the controversy, Yadav had himself opted to go for a deputation in the central government on the completion of his two-year tenure as the police chief of Haryana. In Gurgaon on Wednesday, Vij held a three-hour-long marathon meeting with the top officials of the Gurgaon police at the PWD guest house. While the DCPs were asked to share the details of the unsolved heinous cases and reasons for it, some ACP-rank officers were directed to supervise the pending investigation. “There are few cases of heinous crimes, which have remained unsolved for some reason. In some cases, the deceased were not identified while in other cases, there had been no headway in the probe. We shared the details of the unsolved cases and explained the reasons for the delay,” said a senior police officer. The home minister also stressed on resolving the complaints of the people on priority basis and directed the DCPs to meet the general public everyday for one hour and visit one police station every week under their jurisdiction. “I have directed the police to develop a mechanism to resolve the complaints of people, and if required develop a portal for the same, wherein the status of the complaint should also reflect. If required, an FIR should be registered.” On traffic jams in Gurgaon, Vij directed the traffic cops to identify the spots and junctions which witness regular snarls and come up with a proper plan to solve the issue of road congestion. Vij also advocated setting up of a dedicated cyber police station in each police district of Gurgaon, as “cases of cyber frauds are increasing”. The first cyber police station of Haryana was set up in Gurgaon only. “However, as per the provisions of the IT Act, only an inspector rank officer can investigate cyber crimes. Gurgaon receives a large number of cyber complaints, but we don’t have sufficient investigating officers,” said an officer. The home minister also asked cops to instil fear in the mind of the criminals. “Act against such criminal gangs at an initial stage. Most organised crimes are committed by these gangs and it is important to make the state free from criminal gangs.” During the meeting, Gurgaon police commissioner KK Rao pointed out that around 15 police stations of Gurgaon are operating out of rented places. The minister directed the commissioner to prepare a plan for the construction of new police stations with facilities for cops.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/disagreement-with-cm-on-appointment-vij-says-went-by-rulebook/articleshow/86065650.cms||Bagish Jha

Miniature Ganeshas of heights ranging from 2 to 7 inches have been created from mouldit clay by him. The material is not sticky, which makes it easy to mould the idols. It has a glossy finish, and sets in 90 minutes, and dries quickly. Praveen has been creating miniature Ganeshas for the last 16 years, and two years ago had created 12 unique idols from e-waste. Since class IX, he has been passionate about creating miniature idols, and every year on the occasion of Ganesh Chaturthi, he creates miniature idols from different materials. “As a teenager, I was passionate about miniature carving. I believe in detailing, and my first Ganesha was carved on a rice grain,” he said. He attempted to carve Ganesha on mustard seeds. He has experimented with rendering Ganesha with bamboo, pencil lead, mud, pen refill, ice candy stick, foam blocks and various other materials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/artist-creates-miniature-ganeshas-from-mouldit-clay/articleshow/86076537.cms||---

Dr Mukesh Veer Singh, head of the pediatric department at children hospital, told TOI that there are 120 beds at SRN Children Hospital and a total of 170 children were admitted till Monday. Admitting that there was no space to admit children at SRN Children Hospital, he said, “As the number of beds was limited and more than one kid was being treated on a single bed, we have decided to shift some patients to the new PICU ward at SRN hospital,” he said, adding that parents and attendants are being convinced to shift children to PICU ward. The 100-bed PICU ward with oxygen facility has set up on SRN campus in anticipation of the possible third wave. Due to surge in viral cases, authorities of the district administration, CMO and MLN Medical College have agreed to admit kids suffering from various ailments to the PICU ward.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Hospitals not filling at same clip as Covid cases, ICU cases down||MUMBAI: The increase in Covid cases after travel and entertainment restrictions were eased on August 15 has so far not resulted in a much higher demand for hospital beds in the city. In fact, the number of occupied Covid ICUs has decreased and the majority of new cases are in the mild to moderate category, said BMC health department officials. On Thursday, the BMC dashboard showed that 585 (26.2%) of the 2,225 ICU beds were occupied in various hospitals. “The number is perhaps the same or lower than it was two weeks ago,” said a doctor. The city has been recording 30% occupancy of Covid ICU beds for over a month now. In the private sector, bed occupancy has increased but not in alarming numbers. “A month ago, our occupancy was 10 to 12 patients, but the number has increased to 20-plus now,” said Joy Chakraborthy, COO of Hinduja Hospital, Mahim. In the last two weeks, Dr Priyanka Navelkar Nadkarni of L H Hiranandani Hospital, Powai, has noticed a rise in the number of OPD patients coming with Covid symptoms. “I am definitely handling more home isolation cases than a week ago,” she said. Hospitalisations have increased, but “it’s only a marginal rise”, she said. In Seven Hills Hospital in Andheri, there is a 10-15% rise in daily admissions. While 35 patients were admitted on Wednesday, 42 were admitted on Friday. The average admissions in August were less than half. BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani said they have boosted infrastructure — in terms of beds, oxygen supply and medicines. While fewer than 13,000 hospital beds were available for Covid patients during the first wave last year, the number increased to 21,000 during the second wave’s peak between March and May. For the third wave, the BMC is in the process of building and commissioning jumbo field hospitals that will boost the bed strength to 30,000-plus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hospitals-not-filling-at-same-clip-as-cases-icu-cases-down/articleshow/86078995.cms||---

Speaking to journalists, several released SSC officers said they had met the defence minister as well as the chief of Army staff several times in this regard, but even after several years their efforts have gone in vain. Veterans pointed that they have been discriminated from right and privilege of One Rank One Pension (OROP) policy announced by the government with effect from 2014. They feel it is unjustified as selection process, training for war and oath taken was same as that of regular officers. While the central and state governments have schemes for the benefit of civilians in various categories, there was no such policy for the SSC or emergency commissioned officers. The SSC officers said the provision of medical treatment at military hospitals was arbitrarily withdrawn in 2009. Though the Chandigarh Bench of the Armed Forces Tribunal directed the ministry of defence in 2010 to restore the facilities, the order was challenged before the Supreme Court where it is still pending. Demanding that the status of ex-servicemen be given to the SSC officers on their release from the service, the veterans said they also lose out several benefits like reservation for their wards in admission to educational institutes and resettlement schemes. If this discrimination continues it may have serious impact on talented youth getting attracted to Short Service Commission in Armed Forces which is need of the hour to fill large shortage of officers in Armed Forces.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ssc-officers-demand-pro-rata-pension-like-regular-officers/articleshow/86065663.cms||---

During the congregation, nearly 15 Afghan Sikh sangat (community) also did sewa (voluntary service) of changing old to new clothing of Nishan Sahib (the Sikh flag) at the gurdwara. Bhai Jasbir Singh, granthi of Gurdwara Guru Nanak Darbar, released a video from Jalalabad, in which, he congratulated the Sikhs settled across the world on the eve of the Prakash Purb of Guru Granth Sahib, on behalf of the community members there, the gurdwara and its management committee members. “We thank Guru Granth Sahib Ji for blessing us to celebrate Prakash Purb at the house of Guru Nanak. It is a matter of happiness. Today, we also changed the clothing of Nishan Sahib with the support of the present Sangat here”, said Bhai Jasbir Singh in his video on Tuesday. “We also organised a small programme to congregate the community members at the gurdwara. Those Sikhs who lived near to gurdwara had attended the programme and those who lived far, could not come. Those who were present celebrated the event with full devotion,” told Bhai Jasbir Singh over the phone. Meanwhile, the Sikhs living in Kabul said they could not celebrate the eve due to their busy schedules. “Most of the Sikh sangat in Kabul is planning to visit India on the pilgrimage with regards to 400th Prakash Purb of ninth Guru Teg Bahadar Ji and their luggage are packed. Presently, they are just counting on the days and waiting for the international flights to resume from Kabul airport,” said a Sikh from Kabul. President of Gurdwara Dashmesh Pita, Karta-E-Parwan Gurnam Singh from Kabul, said, “We could not celebrate the Prakash Purb due to busy schedule and also, the granthi Singh was not present in Kabul and the Sangat was unaware of the same. Most of the Sikhs in Kabul are planning to visit India on pilgrimage. We are in talks with the local government authorities and in India as well, and according to the information, we are hopeful that the international flights may start from Kabul by next week on September 16.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/afghan-sikhs-celebrate-first-prakash-purb-of-guru-granth-sahib/articleshow/86065696.cms||---

Resorts, hotels and homestays are the most sought-after, due to the travel restrictions in place, owing to the Covid-19 pandemic. “With restrictions in place to travel to other states, we prefer to go to places that we can drive to, such as beach resorts nearby as well as to Madikeri, Sakleshpur or Chikkamagaluru,” says techie Soumya, who works from home. A caretaker of a heritage resort near Kaup said that bookings are full on weekends. “This month we have free days only from September 21 to September 24, and bookings have already sold out for the rest of the days. Our patrons mainly consist of locals, as well as people from Bengaluru,” he said. “The travel restrictions and fear of Covid-19 is forcing Mangalureans to take up only local outings. Only few of them travel to far-off domestic destinations for long holidays, especially in North India,” said Eulalia D’Souza of Lia Travels and Tours. “The destinations that are a short distance away are safe as well, and people are comfortable with it, due to the prevailing situation. The best thing about nearby destinations is that it saves a lot of travel time, which can be used for other activities,” said a traveller, who did not wish to be named. Cashing on the market, a lot of travel agencies are now offering trekking packages to various nearby locations, during weekends. The package includes trekking for a day or two.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/short-weekend-getaways-most-sought-after-among-mlureans/articleshow/86076603.cms||---

Both the names were posted on the CM’s official twitter handle. Both of them on Thursday thanked the CM for their appointments. Chowdhary Kaiful Wara said, “I haven’t got any confirmation through an official letter so far, but I have seen my name as president of UP Urdu Academy on the chief minister’s official account. I want to thank CM Yogi for considering my name for the post.” Yogi also nominated Mohd Iftekhar Hussain as a member of Haj Committee. Last year, Yogi went to Chowdhary Kaiful Wara’s shop in the Gorakhnath area during the CAA awareness campaign and presented him a booklet related to CAA. The CM then appealed to people to read the reality of the Act instead of believing in rumours. Every year the family of Chowdhary Kailful Wara prepares a welcome gate in front of their shop to welcome ‘shobha yatra’ led by Yogi on the occasion of Vijaya Dashmi.

---||Jaipur||Jaipur traders to shut markets down tomorrow||JAIPUR: With politics taking centrestage, city traders have decided to shut markets down on September 11 after talks with UDH minister Shanti Dhariwal over implementing trade licenses turned inconclusive on Thursday. While Jaipur Municipal Corporation-Greater (JMC-G) has already started implementing the system and served notices to businesses, JMC-Heritage has decided not to go ahead with it. Members of the traders' association, who met Dhariwal, were told that the state government had no role to play in it. But he assured them that the businesses would not be shut down for not paying the licence fees. However, traders have refused to accept this assurance and decided to shut down markets on Saturday in protest. Meanwhile, at a press conference on Thursday, JMC-H mayor Munesh Gurjar stated that they would not implement the licensing system now. “We just want to convey our message to traders that trade licenses will not be implemented right now. I request them to go back from their decision to shut down markets as they have already suffered huge losses in the pandemic. If in future we want to implement it, we will consult with them in advance,” Gurjar said. MLAs from JMC-H area have also given their support to this decision. Speaking on their behalf, MLAs of the heritage area conducted another press conference at the residence of Pratap Singh Khachariyawas and questioned how JMC-G mayor Sheel Dhabai could serve notices to businesses without taking the state government into confidence. They alleged that the licensing system was against the interest of small traders who were overcoming losses suffered during the pandemic. The traders’ association said that they would continue with protests until they are given a written confirmation on scrapping the decision. Subhash Goyal, president of Jaipur Vyapar Mahasangh, alleged that the government was giving false assurances. "Until we get it in writing, traders will not rest," he said. Dr Vijay Kapoor, secretary, Private Hospital And Nursing Homes Society, said, “The government has not taken any decision to withdraw the proposed trade licensing order. The UDH minister didn’t give any clear indication at the meeting. He has sought time to study the matter. Therefore, our decision to hold a strike on Saturday stands.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/city-traders-to-shut-marketsdown-tomorrow/articleshow/86081419.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Farmers call all-party meet today, minus BJP in Chandigarh||BATHINDA: Farmer organisations of Punjab have decided to meet five leaders from each political party of Punjab except BJP in Chandigarh on Friday regarding the early start of campaigning for the state assembly elections. Representatives of 32 farmer organisations of Punjab have asked the political parties to depute five senior leaders each to have a dialogue with farmers at the People’s Convention Centre in Sector 36, Chandigarh. The farmers have also asked the political parties to suspend campaigning till elections are announced as it causes a loss to the ongoing protest on the borders of Delhi and at various places in Punjab. The concession has been made to listen to the political parties before taking any concrete decision on the issue. The need of this arose after farm activists started opposing the leaders in the state and the Shiromani Akali Dal had written to farm leaders, saying it wanted to meet them to clear their doubts about the party’s stand on farm protest. Senior farmer leader Balbir Singh Rajewal said, “As there is a lot of time for elections, political parties should not fully indulge in campaigning as it adversely affects the ongoing farm protest. As some activists were opposing rallies of SAD, the party wanted to meet the farmer leaders. Going by it we decided to meet leaders of all the parties separately, give them different slots, and have fixed a venue at Chandigarh to meet them on Friday. We have asked them to send a list of five representatives to farmers who will appear for meetings.” Congress, SAD and AAP responded promptly to the farmers’ offer for all-party meeting and announced names. SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal deputed four party leaders to attend the meeting convened by the Kisan Morcha. Those who would represent SAD include Balwinder Singh Bhundur, Prem Singh Chandumajra, Maheshinder Singh Grewal and Daljeet Singh Cheema. Party spokesperson Cheema said the party had written a letter to the Kisan Morcha a few days ago to clear its stand on the three contentious agri-marketing laws and to convey that they were with the farmers. He added that the party president received a letter from the Kisan Morcha for the meeting on Thursday. The party’s next strategy would be decided after their meeting with the 32 farmer unions, he said. AAP sources said MLAs Kultar Singh Sandhwan (also head of party’s farmers’ wing), Aman Arora and Punjab general secretary Jagtar Singh Sanghera will attend the meeting. Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu will attend the meeting along with working president Kuljit Singh Nagra and general secretary Pargat Singh, said sources. On July 26, Sidhu had even said that he would go barefoot to meet the protesting farmers. “Congress party stands firmly with the SKM and Kisan Satyagrahis; the three black laws must be repealed,” he had said in a tweet and also clarified that his earlier remark to meet the farmers’ organisations made at his installation ceremony was misunderstood. SAD had started a full-fledged poll campaign under ‘Gal Punjab Di’, but farmers opposed its at almost all places and had clashed with police in Moga on September 2, when they were stopped while heading towards the Akali rally venue. The incident had made SAD suspend its rallies by a week (till September 11). Kirti Kisan Union, which had given a call to oppose SAD, too, will participate in the meeting. KKU vice-president Rajinder Singh Deep Singh Wala told TOI, “It is for the welfare of Punjab, that farmers want the poll campaigning to be cut short as extravagant money spent on it goes from the pockets of common man by way taxes. Political parties, who not listen to anyone, are listening to farmers because of their capability to sustain bigger protest.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farmers-call-all-party-barring-bjp-meeting-today/articleshow/86081400.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Developer Yusuf Lakdawala, held by ED, dies in jail||MUMBAI: Builder and film financier Yusuf Lakdawala, 76, who was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in a money laundering case stemming from a cheating case, died at Arthur Road jail on Thursday. Lakdawala, who had been unwell for a few days and was admitted to the jail hospital, was brought dead to JJ hospital on Thursday at around 11.30am from Arthur Road jail. An accidental death report was filed, post-mortem conducted and the body was handed over to his family. The builder had petitioned the Bombay high court for urgent release on bail on medical grounds. His counsel Abhinav Chandrachud had argued that his cancer had metastasized and he should be allowed to go home and receive treatment at a hospital of his choice. ED and the state had opposed the plea. Lakdawala was in custody in a money laundering case linked to an alleged conspiracy and forging of a 1949 document to buy a prime four-acre plot in Khandala that apparently belonged to the former nawab of Hyderabad. The ED had pointed out to the court that it had learnt that Lakdawala was arrested by the economic offences wing (EOW) of Mumbai police from Ahmedabad airport “while trying to flee the country”. Also, his bail plea was pending before the HC. During the hearing, medical officer Dr V Murthy, an uro-oncology specialist, said Lakdawala “after examination, was advised to have a blood test and receive radiation treatment”, but he refused to do either.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-developer-lakdawala-held-by-ed-dies-in-jail/articleshow/86081427.cms||Ahmed Ali

---||Mangaluru||Relationship issues, substance abuse triggers for suicide in city||Mangaluru: A deadly combination of relationship issues coupled with substance abuse is seen as one of the main reasons for suicide attempts in the city. Death by suicide is a growing problem, and the increasing numbers tell a shocking story. On the sidelines of World Suicide Prevention Day, Dr Supriya Hegde Aroor, consultant psychiatrist, Father Muller Hospital, said that during the Covid-19 pandemic, distress calls have increased by nearly 100%. “On analysis of most of the suicide cases that have been referred to the hospital, we have realised that nearly in 70% of the cases, the victims are dependent on alcohol or intoxicated while attempting to commit suicide. The other reasons for committing suicide are job loss, breakups and major financial loss,’’ she said. Dr Supriya said, “We are seeing a rise in young adults between 20-30, attempting suicide. While a majority of the victims are women, men have more successful attempts. Examination failure is one of the main reasons among teenagers. We are seeing at least three cases per week.” A World Suicide Prevention Day programme was conducted at the in-patient general psychiatry ward of the hospital on Thursday. Patients were educated about how to recognize the warning signs of suicide, and how to prevent it. Every 40 seconds someone takes their own life, according to a World Health Organisation (WHO) report. “Many cases go unreported. For every suicide that results in death, there are as many as 40 attempted suicides. There is a need to improve awareness about mental health, mental illness and suicide. Suicide is preventable through right and timely action,” Dr Supriya said. This year’s theme for World Suicide Prevention Day is ‘Creating hope through action’. World Suicide Prevention Day is observed every year on September 10.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/relationship-issues-substance-abuse-triggers-for-suicide-in-city/articleshow/86076719.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

Stressing on ending the impasse, Haryana home minister Anil Vij said the government is ready to accept the justified demands of the farmers and to conduct a fair probe into the Karnal lathicharge. On the matter of action against the then SDM of Karnal, Ayush Sinha, the DC said that the matter is being investigated and appropriate action will be taken after receiving the report. The DC further said that if the farmers want to participate in the investigation process, they will be welcome, or if they want to get the matter investigated at some other level, that demand too can be accepted. Yadav pointed out that the mini secretariat of any district is where the common man comes for important work, and people are facing a lot of trouble due to the dharna. Regarding action against the then Karnal SDM Ayush Sinha, who had ordered the cops to hit the protesters on their heads, Vij said, “We cannot hang anyone just because someone has desired that... Punishment is always given in accordance with the fault of that person and to know the fault, there has to be some probe. We are ready for an impartial probe on the issue.” "The punishment which is given on the basis of the allegation and to find out the same, an investigation has to be conducted. We are ready for a fair probe but the entire Karnal episode will be investigated. If the farmers or their leaders are found to be accused then action will be taken against them too,” Vij added. The Sanyukt Kisan Morcha condemned Vij’s statement threatening to take action against farmers. SKM said, "Haryana government has been exposed for its anti-farmer agenda. It tried to disrupt the farm movement from the beginning and has filed numerous cases against farmers and farm leaders.” The morcha also criticised the brazen efforts by Haryana government to protect an official who used objectionable words for protesters. "The government has absolutely no justification in saying that it cannot suspend an official. We are asking the government a very reasonable thing, to suspend the official and order an inquiry against him. The refusal of the government speaks volumes about where the officials' impunity is emerging from," said SKM. SKM said farmers are receiving support from the local community and from across Haryana. At several places in Haryana and other states, farmers held protests in support of the Karnal agitation. Following the Muzaffarnagar Kisan Mazdoor Mahapanchayat, a state-level meeting of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha for Mission Uttar Pradesh started at Lucknow on Thursday to make plans for the next phase of the movement in the state and to prepare for the Bharat Bandh on September 27.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/ready-for-probe-into-entire-karnal-episode-vij/articleshow/86085322.cms||---

The BIS and FSSAI approved bottling plant will be equipped with multiple Meghdoot atmospheric water generators (AWG), which have been developed and patented by the company in partnership with CSIR-IICT. “For the first time in the world a packaged water bottling plant will utilise air to meet its water requirements,” said Ramkrishna Mukkavilli, founder & managing director, Maithri Aquatech. Mukkavilli said his company has invested over $3 million in R&D and the bottling facility that has been set up at Cherlapally. He said in addition to India, the company is also in talks with governments and private players in countries like Ghana, UAE, Zambia and Comoros for setting up similar water-from-air bottling plants with capacities as large as 1 million litres of water per day in Ghana and UAE and upto 1 lakh litres per day in Zambia and Comoros. Maithri Aquatech is also looking at setting up semi-knocked down (SKD) Meghdoot assembly plants overseas, including Latin America. “Our Meghdoot AWGs are currently working in offices, factories and homes in 27 countries and we are going to foray into another 13 countries. We are getting large enquiries from Latin America,” he said, adding that it has developed Meghdoot AWGs ranging from 25 litres capacity for residential use to around 5,000 litres capacity for commercial use, he added. He said the bottling plant has achieved yet another global first when it comes to meeting its cooling requirements. “As a side product of the water generation process, Meghdoot also generates cool air, which will provide central cooling to the water testing lab and the bottling area, bringing down and maintaining the temperature between 15 to 18 degrees Celsius,” he explained Pointing out that there is six times more water in the atmosphere than in all the rivers on the planet, he said this source of water is renewable and perennial and will help reduce dependence on groundwater as well as other water bodies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/maithri-aquatech-sets-up-worlds-first-water-from-air-bottling-plant-in-hyd/articleshow/86079129.cms||---

The judges also asked the government to consider increasing the salary of police personnel by at least 10% considering the incomparable risk they take. A division bench of Justice N Kirubakaran (since retired) and Justice B Pugalendhi observed that the court had by an earlier judgement directed the state to constitute a commission headed by a retired high court judge and comprising psychologist, psychiatrists, social worker, advocate who is an expert in service law, retired and serving police officials to look into the grievance of police personnel.However, in contrary to that, the government constituted the commission in 2019 headed by a retired IAS officer and comprising retired and serving police officials. Though the judges said they are not underestimating the work done by that commission, they directed the government to reconstitute it in line with the earlier judgement within three months.The judges said that police have to take many avatars so that people could lead a normal and peaceful life. However, it is stated that they are paid poorly in spite of round-the-clock committed services. So far, 6,823 desertions have taken place in the past 10 years, nearly 25 police personnel have committed suicide and 200 have died due to illness in 2020. Though various reasons are cited for suicides and illness, work pressure might be one of them. Police should be given medical leave in time and provided the best possible treatment for illnesses.Since nearly 15,819 posts in the police force are vacant, the judges observed that the force is under a lot of stress. Hence, earnest efforts should be taken to fill the posts and also increase the strength of the force. Though their duty time is only eight hours, they work round-the-clock. Hence, the eight-hour norm in three shifts should be followed strictly. The court passed the order while disposing of a public interest litigation filed by A Masilamani, a retired policeman of Madurai, who sought to increase the salary and allowance of police personnel, to increase the per capita of the police force in the state and also fill up vacancies in the department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-tells-govt-to-recast-police-commission-with-ex-judge-as-head/articleshow/86081415.cms||Kaushik Kannan

We are ready for an impartial probe on the issue.” "The punishment which is given on the basis of the allegation and to find out the same, an investigation has to be conducted. We are ready for a fair probe but the entire Karnal episode will be investigated. If the farmers or their leaders are found to be accused then action will be taken against them too,” Vij added. The Sanyukt Kisan Morcha condemned Vij’s statement threatening to take action against farmers. SKM said, "Haryana government has been exposed for its anti-farmer agenda. It tried to disrupt the farm movement from the beginning and has filed numerous cases against farmers and farm leaders.” The morcha also criticised the brazen efforts by Haryana government to protect an official who used objectionable words for protesters. "The government has absolutely no justification in saying that it cannot suspend an official. We are asking the government a very reasonable thing, to suspend the official and order an inquiry against him. The refusal of the government speaks volumes about where the officials' impunity is emerging from," said SKM. SKM said farmers are receiving support from the local community and from across Haryana. At several places in Haryana and other states, farmers held protests in support of the Karnal agitation. Following the Muzaffarnagar Kisan Mazdoor Mahapanchayat, a state-level meeting of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha for Mission Uttar Pradesh started at Lucknow on Thursday to make plans for the next phase of the movement in the state and to prepare for the Bharat Bandh on September 27.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ready-for-probe-into-entire-karnal-episode-vij/articleshow/86081461.cms||---
---||Delhi||SC restores tribunal award of Rs 2,800cr to R-Infra by DMRC for Airport Metro||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday restored arbitral tribunal order directing the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation to pay Rs 2,800 crore along with interest to Reliance Infrastructure-led Delhi Airport Metro Express Pvt Ltd for termination of contract for running Delhi Metro’s Airport Express Line. A bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and S Ravindra Bhat allowed the plea of DAMEPL, which had approached the apex court after the arbitral award passed in its favour was quashed by the Delhi high court. While passing the verdict, the bench also expressed concern over the "disturbing tendency of courts" in setting aside arbitral awards. The ill-fated airport line had run into trouble right from the inception with studies showing the route from New Delhi Railway Station to the airport as likely to be unviable. At the time, DMRC head E Sreedharan had expressed reservations over DMRC constructing the line and the Anil Ambani-promoted Reliance Infrastructure running it. The Planning Commission finally approved an Rs 800-crore project that got more expensive with time. DMRC had in 2008 accepted the bid of a consortium comprising Reliance Infrastructure Limited and M/s Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles, SA and an agreement was entered into between DMRC and DAMEPL for design, installation, commissioning, operation and maintenance of the 22.7km Airport Express Line project. DAMEPL had in 2012 terminated the concession agreement and DMRC invoked arbitration as per the agreement. DAMEPL stopped its operations on June 30, 2013 and handed over the line to DMRC the next day. While restoring the arbitral award, the court said the conclusion of the HC that the award suffers from patent illegality and shocks the conscience of the court "is held to be erroneous". "The members of the arbitral tribunal, nominated in accordance with the agreed procedure between the parties, are engineers and their award is not meant to be scrutinised in the same manner as one prepared by legally trained minds. In any event, it cannot be said that the view of the tribunal is perverse. Therefore, we do not concur with the high court’s opinion that the award of the tribunal on the legality of the termination notice is vitiated due to the vice of perversity," the bench said. DAMEPL had sought payment of an amount of Rs 3,470 crore as termination payment but the tribunal awarded a total amount of Rs 2,782.33 crore, along with further interest. The bench also said the courts should show restraint while examining the validity of the arbitral awards as limited grounds are available for annulment. "This approach would lead to corrosion of the object of the 1996 Act and the endeavours made to preserve this object, which is minimal judicial interference with arbitral awards. That apart, several judicial pronouncements of this court would become a dead letter if arbitral awards are set aside by categorising them as perverse or patently illegal without appreciating the contours of the said expressions," it said. Reacting to the verdict, DMRC, in a press release, said the judgment was being analysed "for future course of action".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sc-restores-tribunal-award-of-rs-2800cr-to-r-infra-by-dmrc-for-airport-metro/articleshow/86083279.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary
---||Madurai||Party flags may be allowed on vehicles only during polls: HC||MADURAI: Madras high court has observed that the purpose of having party flags or designation boards or portraits of party/communal leaders or advocate/press stickers is only to prevent the police from stopping the vehicles and to flout the law. Taking into account the report submitted by the DGP and transport officials in this regard, a division bench of Justice N Kirubakaran (since retired) and Justice B Pugalendhi observed that fixing of flags of any nature is not authorized by law and is illegal. The court referred to an incident where police found huge quantity of ganja in a car with advocate sticker about three years ago in Theni. “It has become an order of the day in the state that almost 50% of the vehicles either have party flags or designation boards or portraits of party/communal leaders or advocate/press stickers. This menace has to be addressed, failing which the criminal activities will continue to be committed by the above modus operandi.” The judges observed that as stated by the DGP, the police may face difficulties while discharging their duties as they may hesitate to stop and check such vehicles as the people travelling in them enter into heated arguments, resulting in law and order problems. The court said vehicle owners may be permitted to fix party flags on their vehicles during elections if they are involved in election works for any political party. At other times, no one except constitutional authorities has got any right to do so. They directed the authorities to instruct owners of vehicles to remove such portraits within 60 days, failing which the authorities shall remove the same and impose fines on the vehicles. The judges also issued a series of directions to the authorities to ensure that lights and number plates were fixed in vehicles according to Motor Vehicles Act and Rules. The court passed the order while disposing of a PIL filed by V Ramesh, an advocate from Madurai district who sought actions against the misuse of advocate stickers in vehicles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/party-flags-may-be-allowed-on-vehicles-only-during-polls-hc/articleshow/86081438.cms||Kaushik Kannan

---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Newborn reunited with parents, abductor held||AHMEDABAD: Sola police on Wednesday caught a 25-year-old woman from Sarkhej for abducting a newborn girl from Sola Civil Hospital on September 2. The woman, Nagma Ghori, allegedly abducted the two-day infant because she did not have a child of her own, said police officers. A Sola police team led by inspector J P Jadeja and 70 cops checked footage from some 500 CCTV cameras on the 15-km stretch from Sola to Sarkhej crossroads and cracked the case. Ghori separated from her husband about six years ago and wanted a child. She decided to abduct a newborn child around a year ago. On September 1, at around 3pm, she went to Sola Civil Hospital and watched the 40 women and their newborn children there. She stayed there till she abducted the newborn at around 2.30am. “On seeing the newborn and her mother sleeping, she went closer picked up the child calmly to make sure she would not start crying and swiftly walked out of the maternity ward and then the hospital,” said a police officer. Ghori walked for around 6km while holding the baby and tried to hail an autorickshaw. As she did not get a rickshaw, she began flagging down people going on two-wheelers. A man on a scooter stopped on seeing her and she told him that the newborn was her child and she was trying to save herself from her husband who was trying to beat her. The man advised her to go to the police, but she insisted that he drop her to an autorickshaw so that she could go to her place. He agreed to her appeal and took her to near Hebatpur Crossroads, where she found an autorickshaw and it took her till Sarkhej Crossroads. There, she changed rickshaws and then went to her home in Sarkhej. After tracing the accused through CCTV footage, a team of police stayed in Sarkhej for about three days till they caught Ghori with the infant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/newborn-reunited-with-parents-abductor-held/articleshow/86079206.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Javed Akhtar defamation case: No Bombay HC relief for Kangana Ranaut||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Thursday dismissed an application filed by actor Kangana Ranaut to quash criminal defamation proceedings initiated by an Andheri metropolitan magistrate against her in February on a complaint filed by lyricist-screenwriter Javed Akhtar. Ranaut had contended that the magistrate had not followed the procedure under the law and had displayed “non-application of mind” in summoning her. The HC found “no ground” to interfere or quash the proceedings on the basis of alleged procedural irregularity adopted by the magistrate while taking cognizance of the complaint against Ranaut. “The order issuing process, dated February 1, reflects application of mind and hence, warrants no interference,” said Justice Revati Mohite-Dere, who dismissed the actor’s application finding it “devoid of merit”. Ranaut’s counsel Rizwan Siddiquee argued that the magistrate had not followed the proper procedure in directing the police to do a probe which resulted in a “one-sided inquiry” as her witnesses were not examined. She was left “remedy-less” and thus had to approach the HC to protect her fundamental rights was also her plea. Siddiquee later said he would move the Supreme Court. An Andheri metropolitan magistrate is scheduled to hear the case on September 14. Akhtar’s lawyer Jay Bharadwaj said Ranaut did not respond to the police request for her statement adding that the magistrate “thoroughly applied his mind”, and relied on the complaint’s verification statement as well as Ranaut’s television interview. The HC noted and Bharadwaj too had argued that “there is no challenge” to the contents of the November 2020 complaint and Ranaut’s grievance only pertains to the “illegal procedure”. The order said, “The magistrate examined the com-plainant (Akhtar)” on oath and then sent the complaint for probe to police and hence complied with the legal requirements.” The HC said the three opti-ons available to the magistrate under Section 202 of the CrPC are to either inquire into the case himself, direct police to make investigation, or direct a person he thinks fit to probe. The HC said the magistrate exercised the second option. Juhu police after recording statements of several witnesses submitted its report “observing that a cognizable offence is disclosed against applicant (Ranaut)”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/akhtar-defamation-case-no-hc-relief-for-kangana/articleshow/86081470.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Mumbai||BMC education department nod to CBSE, ICSE to hold offline exams||MUMBAI: The BMC's education department has given its nod to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) and international schools to hold practical tests and board exams in Mumbai in the physical mode for class 10 and 12 from September to November. The final go-ahead will have to come from the municipal commissioner.  Non-state boards like Cambridge, International Baccalaureate (IB) and International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) had got permission in February to conduct in-person board exams for class 10, 11 and 12. These schools held offline exams smoothly in February in the city and no student of theirs had tested positive. This time, international schools, CBSE and CISCE have sought BMC’s permission to conduct mock board exams in September and written physical exams in October-November. Francis Joseph, Director, SLN Global Network, who is coordinating with the boards, said, “Considering that schools are presently empty and students are limited in number, all Covid protocols can be adhered to.”  CBSE and CISCE have decided to have two board exams. While CISCE will conduct its first semester board exams for ICSE (class 10) and ISC (class 12) in the offline mode in November, CBSE may look at holding in-person multiple choice questions exams in November-December.  BMC’s education department officers recently held meetings with representatives of the boards. They have assured the BMC of compliance with all Covid-19 protocols laid down by the municipal corporation and the state. State board schools, on the other hand, have no clarity on their plans. The state had last month asked the education board to submit a roadmap for board exams for class 10 and 12 students. The state board along with CBSE and CISCE had cancelled board exams in 2020-21 due to the pandemic.  The state is, however, conducting HSC and SSC supplementary exams from next week. As fewer students have registered, it won't be difficult to allot centres, by adhering to Covid protocols. Schools in Mumbai have not reopened since last year.  While giving the nod to conduct exams offline, the civic education department has clarified that no pre-primary to class 9 students can be called to schools. Legal action will be initiated against those found violating the rules||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-edu-dept-nod-to-cbse-icse-to-hold-offline-exams/articleshow/86079166.cms||Sandhya Nair
---||Jaipur||In a first, IAF’s Hercules lands on national highway near Barmer||Jalore: As a Hercules C-130J aircraft of the Indian Air Force (IAF) touched down on a 3km stretch on NH 925 near Barmer in a mock emergency on Thursday, the country’s first emergency landing facility (ELF) on a national highway got a flying start. With three Union ministers on board, the mission also paved the way for 19 more ELFs that will come up on highways across the country. Two of them will come up in Rajasthan. Union defence minister Rajnath Singh and minister for road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari inaugurated the ELF and witnessed aircraft operations on it. Union jal shakti minister and Jodhpur MP Gajendra Singh Shekhawat was also on the flight. Chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat, Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria and other officials were present at the inauguration. TOI on Monday had reported that the Union ministers would fly in the aircraft as a part of the inauguration ceremony of the ELF, built under the supervision of National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), where all types of IAF aircraft can land. “While this is the first-of-its-kind runway in the country, we are working on 19 similar projects. Of these, two more will be in Rajasthan,” said Gadkari. The two in the state will come up between Phalodi and Jaisalmer as well as Barmer and Jaisalmer. “By creating a strip so close to the international border, we have sent a message that we will stand up for unity, diversity and sovereignty of our country at any cost,” said Rajnath Singh. Gadkari said NHAI is willing to provide land for small airports in the region which would be used for defence as well as civilian purposes. “This landing strip is evidence of interoperability between different ministries. While it normally takes over a year to construct a landing strip, NHAI can do it in 15 days if IAF wants it,” he added. Later, in Jaisalmer, Rajnath Singh inducted the medium range missile defence system (MRMDS) in the IAF. This missile unit has been made jointly by India and Israel and the first missile base has been set up at Jaisalmer Air Force station. Inaugurating the base, the defence minister provided the missile key to Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/in-a-first-iafs-hercules-lands-on-national-highway-near-barmer/articleshow/86081542.cms||---

Fresh investments made by the state government in opening 113 new colleges seem to have fallen flat as none of the existing state government institute made it to the top 100. Among the top 100 institutes — BITS-Pilani, Banasthali Vidyapith and MNIT Jaipur — were ranked 29, 66 and 72, respectively. While BITS-Pilani and Banasthali Vidyapith are private organisations, MNIT-Jaipur is a central government institution. Similarly, IIT-Jodhpur, National Law University-Jodhpur and AIIMS-Jodhpur, which have bagged ranks in the top 100 in various categories, are all governed by the central government. Only Mohan Lal Sukhadia University, Udaipur, which is run by the state government, managed to get a place in top 200 of NIRF in overall category and its pharmacy institute managed the 67th rank. The biggest institute of the state — Rajasthan University — failed to earn a rank this year. Sudhir Raniwal, RU ex-professor, said when appointment of VC is politically driven and where faculty is more focused on getting political benefits, status of academics will go down.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-institutes-fail-to-make-a-mark-in-national-rankings/articleshow/86081538.cms||---

Salla has sought release for two weeks citing heart ailment of his father and that he is the only son and needs to tend to his father during his illness. It has also been submitted that he has not been granted bail ever since his arrest in this case, for the charges levelled against him were under the 2016 amended Anti-Hijacking Act. The high court has also asked the central government’s counsel to inquire about Salla’s father’s illness and place a report on it on Monday. Salla was convicted in June 2019 by a special NIA court for planting a threat note in a lavatory of a Mumbai-Delhi Jet Airways flight in October 2017. Salla’s conviction was the first conviction in the 2016 amended anti-hijacking laws. The minimum punishment prescribed upon being found guilty is life imprisonment. Besides awarding minimum sentence, the NIA court imposed a Rs 5-crore fine on Salla. From this amount, the court ordered compensation of Rs 1 lakh each to the pilot and the co-pilot, Rs 50,000 each to two flight attendants and Rs 25,000 each to all the 116 passengers on board.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hijacking-convict-salla-seeks-interim-bail/articleshow/86079263.cms||---

In Madurai district, as many as 520 students from government and aided schools who underwent free government e-box coaching will also write the exam on September 12. Government school students are more determined to score well thanks to the implementation of the 7.5% quota for them. “I’ve prepared well and have practised with model question papers. Physics is a little difficult but I’ve covered biology and chemistry more thoroughly. However, there is still a fear since we don’t know how questions will be asked,” said K Prasanna Kumar, an aspirant from a government school. “I recently wrote the mock test, which was a bit of struggle as it was held offline. With more time, I can do better,” said another student, M Mukesh. “We are hoping for better results this time. Students are more confident after writing mock tests and we also explained how negative marking affects the score and how to minimise it. Throughout the year, we have been proactively supporting students to study. Despite challenges, students were also equally eager to learn by connecting with us,” said S Vennila Devi, district NEET co-ordinator. V Vishalini, who underwent government NEET e-box coaching, said even without physical interactions she was able to connect with teachers and clear doubts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/govt-school-students-better-prepared-for-neet-this-yr/articleshow/86081541.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

---||Mumbai||‘Four extremely heavy rain events in Mumbai each year in past decade’||MUMBAI: The city on an average has experienced four extremely heavy rainfall events each year in the last decade—from 2010-20—clearly showcasing that extreme climatic events have become a regular feature in the recent past. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) considers rainfall of more than 204.5mm in 24 hours as extremely heavy. The analysis was shared by World Resources Institute India at the stakeholder consultation meeting held on Thursday to draft Mumbai’s Climate Action Plan during a discussion on urban flooding and water resource management. Experts said that if the current trend of increasing extreme heavy rainfall continues, efforts towards flood mitigation must be scaled up drastically. They also said that considering the current infrastructural challenges, changing rainfall patterns and future water demand, Mumbai will need to adopt a holistic approach to water resource management. Mainstreaming flood-risk mitigation into developmental planning will help in better planning for the future. Panelist Nikhil Anand, associate professor of anthropology at University of Pennsylvania in the US, said: “Climate change is here with the number of heavy rain days increasing, rising sea level and an increasing number of cyclones. Flooding in the city is a direct result of reclamation over the last many decades and if we do not take mitigation and adaptation steps in the future it may be a concern.” At the launch of the Climate Action Plan in August, BMC commissioner I S Chahal had predicted that by 2050, a major portion of south Mumbai, including Cuffe Parade and Nariman Point, will go under due to the rising sea level. When high tide coincides with heavy rainfall, Mumbai is prone to coastal inundation, making informal settlements highly vulnerable. Panelist Amita Bhide, dean school of Habitat Studies at Tata Institute of Social Sciences, said sanitation was equally important and linked to the heal-th of urban population. “While there is CSR funding towards the building of toilets, the same should be reviewed as functions like AC toilets, washing machines need to be checked for their sustainability and also if suitable to the surrounding locality,” said Bhide.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-4-extremely-heavy-rain-events-in-city-each-yr-in-past-decade/articleshow/86081568.cms||Richa Pinto

The plot was allegedly hatched by Sheetal Pansare (29), a constable, who was his colleague at Nehru Nagar police station. Pansare allegedly hired Vishal Jadhav (18), son of a watchman of the building where she resided, and Ganesh Chavan (21), a domestic help. Pansare and Vishal were arrested from their residence in Ulwe, Ganesh was held in Telangana on Wednesday. Navi Mumbai police commissioner Bipin Kumar Singh said, “The motive was Pansare’s enmity with Sanap. Since 2019, she filed two complaints against Sanap, alleging rape and molestation, at CBD and Vishnu Nagar police stations in Thane. Both cases are sub judice.” Senior inspector Ajay Landge said, “Pansare had purchased a second-hand Tata Nano to execute the crime. The accused burnt the car to destroy evidence. For the contract killing, she gave Rs50,000 to Vishal and Rs70,000 to Ganesh, by transferring the amount to his brother’s bank account in Telangana. Pansare has taken a loan of Rs 11 lakh from the police welfare fund and used part of it to hire contract killers, and put the rest in a fixed deposit. To trace the Nano, we checked CCTV footage of toll plazas at the city’s exit points, till Mumbra, but got no leads. As Pansare was the prime suspect, we summoned her estranged husband, Dhanraj Jadhav, an ST bus conductor, from Nashik.” He said that Pansare had befriended him on Instagram last year and within five days she married him. Then, she told Dhanraj to kill Sanap and take revenge. When Dhanraj refused, she registered a case against him at RCF police station. Landge said, “While scanning footage near Panvel station, two youth were seen parking a Tata Nano. Pansare was seen loitering in the area. The duo traveled by train from Panvel to Kurla. They then followed Sanap by train from Kurla to Panvel. Dhanraj identified a suspect as Vishal.” Vishal confessed to the crime.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-woman-constable-2-aides-held-for-city-cops-contract-killing/articleshow/86079253.cms||George Mendonca

The cheques were handed over to Sahil Kajal, son of farmer Sushil Kajal of Raipur Jattan village in Karnal district who allegedly died after lathicharge, and injured farmer Gurjant Singh, whose right eye vision has been affected after the police action, in Karnal. Gurjant contributed his share of money to the langar for farmers at Karnal protest site. “The services and support which is being offered to farmers has motivated us and we thank every person and organisation contributing to the cause of the rights of farmers and country. I have decided to contribute the aid that I received to the langar as many other organisations have supported me in my treatment of injuries received during the police lathicharge.” SBSSS president Manjit Kaur Bola, a retired government schoolteacher from Banga, said, “Every section of the society, be it employees or general public, is standing firmly with the farmers. The government should not commit such excesses on its own people who are protesting for their rights. It is a democratic country and we pray for the success of the farmers.” Regarding Gurjant, she said, “He received serious injury in his eye due to police lathicharge.

---||Chandigarh||Punjab: Cotton growers panic due to pink bollworm attack in Bhatinda and Mansa||BATHINDA: The pink bollworm attack on the cotton crop in two districts of Mansa and Bathinda is turning to alarming levels with panicky farmers turning to insecticide dealers to get sprays. In this situation some unrecommended insecticides, too, are being sprayed on the recommendations of insecticide dealers. The pest attack has been noticed in over 10% of the total area under cotton in the two districts. Cotton is sown in 56% area in these two districts out of the total crop sown in the state. The economic threshold level (ETL) has been noticed at much higher than 5% at many places with up to eight-nine adults per leaf. In 2015, the white fly attack had caused immense damage to cotton crop, affecting over 60% crop. Facing losses, many farmers had ended lives. “The state agriculture department has started holding camps in various villages, asking farmers to use only recommended sprays and not panic. Meetings are being held with insecticides dealers, who are being asked to provide only insecticides recommended by the Punjab Agriculture University,” department director Sukhdev Singh told TOI. “We have used sprays but the pest is still there. Not just the leaves, even plants are dying,” said Bikar Singh, a farmer from Khiala Kalan village. Similar sentiments were expressed by Baldev Singh of Gharaghna village in Mansa. Farmers from Sangat, Jai Singh Wala in Talwandi Sabo block, said they are getting panicky. “The department teams have visited these villages besides Dullowal, Bhikhi and Bhamme Khurd in Jhunir block. I, along with joint director (inputs) Baldev Singh, had visited various villages to check the pest attack. We have been asking farmers to approach the agriculture department officials if they detect the pest in more than 5%,” said Mansa chief agriculture officer Manjit Singh, who also has the charge of Bathinda district. He confessed that situation is alarming as at some places ETL is above permissible limits but we are doing the needful and telling farmers to check 100 flowers from different places and plants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pink-bollworm-attack-leads-to-panic-among-cotton-growers/articleshow/86081577.cms||Neel Kamal

Trade credit insurance is a product that protects businesses against the risk of non-payment for goods and services by buyers. It usually covers a portfolio of buyers and indemnifies an agreed percentage of an invoice that remains unpaid because of default, insolvency or bankruptcy. The new guidelines will enable general insurance companies to offer trade credit insurance with customised covers for suppliers, SMEs, MSMEs as well as banks, factoring companies and other financial institutions to manage non-payment risk associated with trade financing portfolio. The scope of cover under trade credit insurance policy shall be the credit risk that has a direct link with an underlying trade transaction, which is the delivery of goods or services. It will cover commercial as well as political risks. On the commercial risks front, these policies will cover insolvency or protracted default of the buyers of goods and services. These policies will also cover rejection by the buyer after delivery, subject to conditions of contract. It will also cover political risk in case of buyers outside India and in respect of those countries agreed upon. It will cover situations like occurrence of war, hostilities, revolution, insurrection or other disturbances in the buyer’s country. The policy will define ‘maximum liability amount’ which is the maximum loss that can be paid under one single policy as well as well-defined credit limits for each of the buyers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/irdai-issues-revised-trade-credit-insurance-guidelines/articleshow/86079289.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Full vax below average in 21 of 36 Maharashtra districts; hasten it, say experts||MUMBAI: Amid concerns of a surge in cases, medical experts have requested the state to accelerate the administration of second doses of the Covid-19 vaccine. As on Thursday, Maharashtra had given both the shots to barely 19% of its adult population. A TOI analysis has found that as many as 21 of the 36 (58%) districts are below the state average in complete vaccination coverage. In fact, districts such as Hingoli and Nanded have given the second jab to less than 10% of their population. Other districts with low double dose coverage include Jalgaon, Gadchiroli, Palghar, Beed and Parbhani, among others. Mumbai is the only district where more than 32% have been fully vaccinated, a number that could be achieved due to considerable vaccination in the private sector. Recently, public vaccination centres too held dedicated days for administration of second doses. Pune and Thane have fully vaccinated 28% and 20% of their population, respectively. “Complete vaccination is crucial to avoid a third wave, one that could be driven by new variants,” said Dr Om Srivastava, infectious disease expert and a member of the state Covid-19 taskforce. The doctor added with fear of emerging variants such as C.1.2 that have the potential to be dangerous, complete vaccination must be stressed upon. Even as the state has done the highest number of full vaccinations (1.8 crore) in the country, the coverage may be inadequate to prevent a surge given its population size. Dr Shashank Joshi, another member of the taskforce, said while one dose does provide some immunity, highest protection from hospitalisation and death can be achieved only with the administration of both the doses as soon as a person becomes eligible. “One of the reasons why there is a sizable gap between first and second doses is the 84-day interval for Covishield,” he said. Like most states, the lion’s share of vaccinations in Maharashtra has happened with Covishield. According to CoWin, 87% of immunisation has been carried out with Covishield, 12.5% with Covaxin and 0.22% with Sputnik. Covaxin and Sputnik have an interval of 28 days between the two doses. District officials say it is a challenge to ascertain people who have not received the second dose but remain within the allowable interval, those who has passed sufficient time after qualifying, and those who have missed the second dose altogether. “We had about 22,000 people in the district due for the second dose. We administer them as and when doses arrive, but we don’t prioritise them,” said Dr Shivaji Pawar, district health officer of Hingoli. State officials said that the number of people awaiting a second dose is constantly changing. “It’s mostly in the range of 20 lakh to 22 lakh,” said an official. The state has administered at least one dose to 55% of the adult population.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-full-vax-below-avg-in-21-of-36-maha-districts-hasten-it-say-experts/articleshow/86079357.cms||Sumitra Debroy

While the pandemic scenario is improving for the state, it may take longer for mental well-being to get back on track, experts say. Rajendra Asari, additional CP, Sector 1, said that there have been a high number of suicides this year. “It could be a year of despair, but it could also be a year of new beginnings. Many have come out of the crisis and started life afresh. Friends and families are still the strong support system that can give both support and direction to a person in need,” he said. “Teams at spots such as the Sabarmati riverfront are also identifying potential persons in need and reaching out to them.” September 10 is observed as World Suicide Prevention Day to create awareness about mental illness and the need for support systems. Sudhir Mankodi, coordinator of Saath suicide prevention helpline, said the most basic thing for suicide prevention is to provide emotional support. “Before the pandemic, we would consult three or four persons at our facility and attend to several calls every day. These numbers increased threefold since the pandemic began,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/year-of-despair-also-of-fresh-starts/articleshow/86079329.cms||Parth Shastri

Similarly, in view of the efforts being made by the scientists, Dalal said the agriculture department would soon provide land to the scientists to produce more and more new varieties of sugarcane seeds so that the new variety of seeds could be made available to the farmers at the earliest. He added that all sugar mills had been directed to operate in the first week of November so that farmers could get their crops crushed on time. The minister said farmers would get more profit by running the sugar mill early and they would be able to sow their next crop.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hry-raises-sugarcane-sap-by-rs12/q/articleshow/86081584.cms||---

However, crowds were more scattered and many traders said that they are expecting more customers only on Friday.M Kathik, who was selling Ganesha idols on East Masi Street, said that sales have been decent so far. “This year, people are keen to buy small idols for their homes or offices. The prices also are a little on the higher side. With the increase in cost of paint, naturally the overall cost has increased,” he said. The minimum cost of a small Ganesha idol was Rs 50, while there were also larger idols sold for up to Rs 300. Another idol maker from Vilacheri, M Ramalingam, said that sales have picked up during the last two days. “This time, we even manufactured only idols that are 3-12 inches tall and all such small and medium sized idols have seen good sales,” he said. Ganesha idols made of clay were also sold in the city. “For more than 15 years, we are in the business. Every year, we come from Kondhagai for selling clay idols in Madurai. We hope to get good business by Friday,” said S Loganathan. The clay Ganeshas were a bit more expensive, and medium size idols sell for anywhere between Rs 300 and Rs 500.At various spots in the city, banana leaves, Arugampul, flowers and fruits were also sold for the celebrations. Meanwhile, Mattuthavani flower market now functioning at the Mattuthavani Omni Bus Stand, saw crowds rushing to buy flowers on Thursday. Co-ordinator of Madurai Flower Market Associations S Ramachandran said that flower prices have seen a small rise due to high demand. “We expect the prices to rise further. It would be better if we can shift to the original market place again as people know the place well,” he said. Jasmine sold for Rs 1,000/kg, while mullai sold for Rs 800/kg, sampangi for Rs 300/kg, button roses for Rs 300/kg, and arali for Rs 400/kg.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/sales-pick-up-ahead-of-vinayagar-chaturthi/articleshow/86081576.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

The plea also alleged that the events would be funded by the state treasury.The court, however, observed that the petition was filed hurriedly and without doing proper homework. A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh allowed the petitioner to withdraw the petition and granted him liberty to file a fresh plea with proper averments, noting that the petitioner has not placed on record the advertisement based on which the petition has been filed.Petitioner-advocate Manohal Lal Sharma said he got to know through media that the Delhi government had been inviting people to join on September 10 Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations organised by the state.The plea contended that conducting and promoting religious worship by the state and giving advertisement in TV channels from state treasury is contrary to articles 21 (protection of life and personal liberty), 25 (freedom to practice religion) and 14 (equality before law) and the basic structure of secularism. It said the religious programme was being funded by the state government for political and electoral gain and was liable to be stopped.On Wednesday, DDMA issued an order that Ganesh Chaturthi will not be allowed at public places in view of the pandemic. Also, people have been advised to celebrate at home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-refuses-to-entertain-plea-against-govt-funded-chaturthi-celebrations/articleshow/86079367.cms||---

A total of 739 EVs were registered that month. This August saw 2,603 vehicles being registered as the overall share of this category in new registrations showed a spike. Although overall vehicle registration has gone down since the previous years due to Covid-19, the number of EVs being registered in the city has risen steadily. Not only has the registration of EVs been going up, but with 2,413 of them registered in July, the last two months have logged more electric vehicles being sold in Delhi than purely CNG-run ones. However, registration of CNG-petrol hybrid cars has remained significantly higher every month. While 1,445 EVs were registered in January, the corresponding number for CNG-run vehicles was 2,121. In February, the EV figure went up to 1,599 against 2,648 for CNG vehicles and in March, the respective figures of the two categories were 2,914 and 2,201. As the second Covid wave swept the capital forcing a lockdown, overall vehicle sales dipped in April and plummeted in May. The former logged the sale of 1,120 EVs and 1,551 CNG vehicles, while May saw just two EVs and zero of the latter being registered. There was some increase in sales in June. In July and August, the registration figures for CNG-run vehicles was 2,357 and 1,966, respectively. Both the figures were lower than that of EVs, 2,603 and 2,413. As per figures shared by Delhi government last month, the share of EVs in new vehicles sales has gone up from 1.2% in the period between August 2019 and July 2020 to 3.3% between August 2020 and July this year after the launch of the EV Policy. Although the bulk of EVs registered are e-rickshaws, followed by electric two-wheelers, this is the segment, apart from electric autorickshaws that Delhi government believes will become the game changers when it comes to scale. The state government has decided to give the permits not yet claimed for autorickshaws only to e-auto applicants and more than 4,000 of these electric three-wheelers are expected to hit Delhi’s streets soon. Delhi government is also talking to the central government on easing restrictions on the number of e-buses that can be inducted under the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles scheme so that up to 5,000 of them can boost the capital’s public transport fleet in the next five years. The government is also working on a war footing to create charging infrastructure across the city. Delhi Transport Corporation recently signed a memorandum of understanding with Convergence Energy Services Limited for the installation of charging stations and battery swapping stations at its bus depots and terminals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/more-e-vehicles-registered-in-delhi-than-those-run-on-cng-in-2-months/articleshow/86079384.cms||Sidharatha Roy

But people started thronging the market when they got out from workplaces late in the evening. Social distancing norms went for a toss at the market. “Because of the sheer number of people, we could not control them,” a shopkeeper said.Flower vendors said the situation wasn’t much different on Wednesday. Flower prices, meanwhile, shot up because of the huge demand. Jasmine, which was sold at Rs 400 a kg, was priced at Rs 1,400 on Wednesday. Similarly, prices of other flowers too had skyrocketed.H Azath, a trader, said the price had slightly come down on Thursday, when jasmine was sold at anywhere between Rs 800 and Rs 1,000 per kg. He said mullai was priced at Rs 600 per kg, seventhi (chrysanthemum) at Rs 120 (per kg), oleander at Rs 250 (per kg), button rose at Rs 230 (per kg) and a rose bunch (20 flowers) at Rs 120.“The price dropped on the day because of the increase in supply and lower demand compared to the previous day. Most of the traders had purchased flowers in bulk on Wednesday itself,” he said.Vinayaka idol sellers were also happy as they could sell more idols this year. Last year, they could sell only a fraction of the idols that they had made because of the restrictions in place. G Selvam, an idol seller at the flower market, said, “The sales are encouraging this year and we expect around 70%-80% of the usual sales this time.”Areas such as Ganapathy, Singanallur, Thudiyalur and Vilankurichi also witnessed a large crowd, who turned out to purchase idols and puja items.B Maragatham, a resident of Ganapathy, said the idols were priced high this year. “But it wasn’t a deterrent, as I spent on it only once a year.

This time, we are planning to restrict the celebrations to home because of the restrictions in place.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/shopping-frenzy-hits-city-on-eve-of-vinayaka-chaturthi/articleshow/86079440.cms||V Devanathan
---||Delhi||Delhi to soon get 2 multi-level bus parking facilities||NEW DELHI: The national capital will soon get multi-level bus parking at Delhi Transport Corporation’s Hari Nagar and Vasant Vihar bus depots, transport minister Kailash Gahlot announced on Thursday. “This multi-level bus parking facility will be yet another world-class, state-of-the-art public transport infrastructure that the Arvind Kejriwal model of governance will give to the people of Delhi,” Gahlot said in a statement. “This facility, built on a self-sustaining model, will undoubtedly put Delhi in the list of world’s top cities in public transport and transport infrastructure,” he added. The project, which aims to develop these two depots at prime locations into world-class depots with up to three times the current parking capacity as well as retail spaces, will be executed by National Buildings Construction Corporation Limited (NBCC). Construction of these first-of-its-kind multi-level bus depots will start by the end of this year and will be completed in a phased manner by 2024, the government said. The depots at Hari Nagar and Vasant Vihar can accommodate 100 and 230 buses each, respectively. The Delhi government said in a statement that these depots would be able to accommodate 330 and 400 buses each over four and seven-floor depots after the redevelopment. These depots will also account for basement parking of over 2.6 lakh sqft, accommodating over 690 cars and retail spaces. DTC had signed an MoU with NBCC in October 2020, according to which NBCC will act as project management consultants for development of its major land parcels in various locations across Delhi, for multi-level bus parking depots, redevelopment of residential colonies of DTC and more commercial facilities. DTC’s residential colonies in Shadipur and Hari Nagar are also being redeveloped into residential units along with retail and commercial facilities. According to the statement, these depots are designed with a vibration isolation system by use of steel helical springs, after noise and vibration impact analyses and a 45° angle for maximum parking efficiency. Various other features such as washing pits, electric charging stations, will also be incorporated at these sites, the government said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/city-to-soon-get-2-multi-level-bus-parking-facilities/articleshow/86079432.cms||---

Despite the ban on the sale of PoP idols, it continues to be sold openly in the city under the garb of pure clay idols. Since the last few years, TOI has been doing on-ground survey with officials of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and members of NGO Green Vigil Foundation. Every year, it was found that sellers would lure customers to buy PoP idols by presenting them as ones made by ‘shadu mitti’. Having no mechanism in place to identify the difference between PoP and pure clay idols has always been a major cause of concern of environmentalists. To overcome this hurdle, mayor Dayashankar Tiwari has formed a committee of 20 idol-makers who are accompanying NMC officials in raids, helping them identifying PoP and pure clay idols. “The idol-makers have been distributed different zones. On Wednesday, the team seized nearly 200 PoP idols and seized fine of Rs 2 lakh,” he said. The mayor further informed that the civic body had first sought help from the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB). “Since NMC has no expertise in identification, we approached the board which cited that it is short-staffed and it’s responsibility is to only make rules. On getting no support from them, we came up with this first-of-its-kind initiative of involving idol makers who have the best expertise,” added Tiwari. As reported by TOI, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court permitted the makers to sell their products only as PoP objects and not as idols. “The sellers need to inform the buyers that the idols are not intended for any kind of worship, nor are they intended to be immersed in any natural or artificial water body,” the court observed. Nodal officer of the NMC’s sanitation department Dr Gajendra Mahalle informed that the NMC has been taking action since September 6. “The action will continue till September 11,” he said. However as per experts, a large number of PoP idols were already sold. “To ensure that the ban is implemented, NMC should start taking action at least a month before. During the raid, we found many makers selling last year’s stock of idols, 80% of which were of PoP,” said Kaustav Chatterjee, founder of NGO Green Vigil Foundation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-ropes-in-sculptors-to-identify-pop-idol-sellers/articleshow/86079510.cms||Manka Behl

The stations will serve passenger EVs and fleets. This will be in line with BluSmart’s plan to expand its network into other major cities across India.The partnership is yet another step taken by the Reliance group’s bid to fast-track an EV ecosystem and create a market for new-age mobility products such as energy storage batteries it proposes to make under a $10 billion green energy play.Last month, Reliance-bp Mobility entered into a pact with the country’s largest food aggregator Swiggy for adoption of EVs, including electric two-wheelers, for deliveries. Jio-bp is taking the partnership route with leading OEMs (original equipment makers), technology, and platform players to emerge as an integrated EV infrastructure player, with a format-specific approach for all vehicle categories.BluSmart has been disrupting the mobility landscape through its all-electric fleet, providing reliable, zero-surge and zero-tailpipe emission ride-hailing service in the NCR. “Leveraging bp’s learnings from the UK with bp Pulse, where they have the country’s largest EV charging network, and from Germany through their Aral brand, Jio-bp intends to bring in the latest in EV technology to our consumers,” the statement quoted company CEO Harish C. Mehta as saying.“EV superhubs are the future of EV charging as it provides seamless charging access to consumers and ride-hailing fleets and we will be jointly building some of the largest EV Superhubs in the world,” the statement quoted BluSmart co-founder Anmol Jaggi as saying.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/jio-bp-blusmart-to-kick-off-ev-charging-in-ncr/articleshow/86079409.cms||Sanjay Dutta

For the construction of viaduct superstructures of 508km long, Mumbai-Ahmedabad High-Speed Rail Project (MAHSR), the state-of-the-art construction methodologies like full span launching methodology (FSLM) will be adopted. This technology will speed up launching girders as the precast girders of full span length will be erected as a single piece for double track viaduct. FSLM is used world over as it is faster than the segment by segment launching method, usually adopted for the construction of viaducts for metro system. NHSRCL is also preparing detailed project reports for seven high speed rail corridors. With the experience of execution of Mumbai-Ahmedabad High Speed Rail project, the works of other corridors will be faster.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/new-transporters-to-speed-up-work/articleshow/86079462.cms||---

The rankings were declared by the ministry of education’s National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) on Thursday. The university retained its position as the number one state university from Maharashtra with Mumbai University coming second at 96. Compared with last year, there has been a mixed response as many institutes slipped, while some climbed in the rankings. Parameters such as perception, patents-filed, financial resources and their utilisation for students among others pulled most of the institutes in the city down. Principals also said that the competition has increased this year as more colleges have registered. Educators said the ban on teacher-recruitment in the colleges leading to recruitment of temporary staff had affected various marking parameters in NIRF. Symbiosis International climbed up in its rankings compared with last year. However, the university too suffered in various parameters such as filing of patents, earnings via research funding, consultancy work and the percentage of students (mostly socially or economically challenged) being provided full tuition fee reimbursement by the institution to pursue their degree programmes. Pro chancellor Vidya Yeravdekar said, “We have set up the IPR cell two years ago and our patents have risen. However, generally, patents are high in engineering-focused institutes. Our engineering college is also building up now on filing patents. We have done well in research as compared to earlier years.” Bharati Vidyapeeth Deemed University’s College of Engineering at the 96th rank among engineering colleges said that the competition is increasing every year as more colleges are participating every year. Making it to the top 100 list when more than 1,500 colleges participated of which there are 20 IITs, 30 NITs and more than 50 good government colleges itself is an achievement, Anand Bhalerao, principal of BVDU CoE, said. Vice-chancellor Nitin Karmalkar said there are two main reasons for slipping in the ranking. “Since the university campus was closed due to Covid-19 pandemic and following restrictions, the number of students coming from foreign countries have reduced. Various programmes which involved foreign faculty have also not happened due to Covid-19 restrictions,” he added. SPPU, IISER in top 50 for research:SPPU and IISER have featured in the top 50 institutes for research. Indian Institute of Sciences tops the list and there are 6 institutes from Maharashtra with IISER, Pune securing the 16th rank and SPPU securing the 37th rank. Ranks in other streams, except for architecture:Despite the city having a fair share of the country’s professional and conventional colleges, there seems to be very little representation in the top 100 institutes in various categories given by NIRF, except in engineering verticals. There is no architecture college from the city to feature in the list, while management, pharmacy verticals have two colleges each in the top 100 list. There is one college each in the medical, law, dental, college list too. “Council of Architecture (COA) is the highest governing body for all architectural institutions. To date, COA approvals were the prime focus of all architectural institutions. COA had mentioned some years ago that no other approval is necessary and that it is coming up with its own accreditation platform. Hence, many institutions had not signed up for NAAC too till recent times. NIRF ranking was never required in architectural institutions and its awareness is also limited on architectural scenarios. Hence, representation of architectural institutions is not seen in NIRF. BNCA is applying for NIRF this year as soon as the next window for application opens up,” Anurag Kashyap, principal of Bhanuben Nanavati College of Architecture said. Fergusson slips to lowest ranking since 2017:Fergusson College is the only one from the city which has featured in the top 100 list of colleges but its ranking has slipped to the lowest since a separate college category was introduced by the NIRF in 2017. However, it still is the only college from the city to feature in the list and also scores very high in terms of academic peers and employers perception parameters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/low-patent-research-scores-keep-pune-colleges-out-of-top-nirf-ranks/articleshow/86079444.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Delhi||Court raps cops for adding IPC section later in NE riot case||New Delhi: Delhi Police cannot cover up its flaw of invoking a penal section against a man for an act that was not initially mentioned by the complainants by recording their supplementary statements, a court has said in a case related to the northeast Delhi riots. It further said the court was conscious of the fact that cases of communal riots had to be considered with utmost sensitivity, “but that does not mean that common sense should be given a go-by”. Mind has to be applied even at the stage of framing of charges with regard to the material available on record, it added.Additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav said the offence under IPC Section 436 (mischief by explosive substance with intent to destroy house) was not made out against Javed in the case related to alleged looting of houses and shops.The judge noted that though one of the complainants had later alleged that after looting his house, the riotous mob had set the same on fire; he did not say a word about it in his initial written complaint based on which the case FIR was registered. “It is only when his statement under Section 161 CrPC was recorded by the investigating officer on 6.03.2020 that ingredients of Section 436 IPC for the first time came into fore and the same were accordingly invoked in the chargesheet,” the judge pointed out. “I am afraid that the investigating agency cannot cover up the said flaw by way of recording the supplementary statements of complainants, if the ingredient(s) of Section 436 IPC was not there in their initial written complaints made to the police,” ASJ Yadav said. The court added that a fine-tooth comb analysis of their respective written complaints also failed to invoke the ingredients of IPC 436. There was also no eyewitness, CCTV footage or photograph of the incident, it pointed out.The judge also said that till date, police had not been able to apprehend any other accused and the investigating agency hadn’t progressed a bit since the accused was granted bail in July last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-raps-cops-for-adding-ipc-section-later-in-ne-riot-case/articleshow/86079451.cms||Usha Das

---||Delhi||EOW files case on DoT complaint as firm refuses to hand over IMEI data||New Delhi: Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of Delhi Police on Wednesday registered a case on the complaint of Department of Telecommunications (DoT) against Mobile Standard Alliance of India (MSAI) for allegedly not providing data related to international mobile equipment identity (IMEI) certificates to the government.Additional commissioner of police (EOW) R K Singh said a case had been registered. According to police, to prohibit the import of mobile phones with duplicate, fake and non-genuine IMEI, DoT issued a standard operating procedure (SOP) in 2015. It was implemented by the government through the IMEI cloning and duplication restriction (ICDR) system that was operated by MSAI, erstwhile reporting body of London-based GSMA. Since 2015, MSAI was responsible for the operations in India. “From April 29, 2019, another organisation took over the charge for GSMA reporting body in India for TAC (type allocation code). TAC is the first eight digits of IMEI,” the complainant told police. Later, DoT sent a letter to MSAI stating it was not allowed to operate ICDR. It was further asked to submit all data related to IMEI certificates, imported devices and user account details of brands, manufacturers, importers and customs officers. According to police, in reply, MSAI wrote the project was given to GSMA and MSAI, so mutual understanding and consent of both parties were required for further process. DoT, in 2020, wrote another letter asking MSAI to provide data along with confirmation regarding the closure of ICDR operations. “MSAI informed DoT that due to the lockdown, its office was closed and it wasn’t able to process any request. The DoT allowed MSAI to provide data within seven days of lifting of lockdown in Delhi,” the complainant said, adding that no response was given by MSAI. DoT, in August 2020, gave the final opportunity to MSAI, but it failed.Later, a DoT official filed the complaint and a case was registered under various sections of the IPC following an investigation. Investigators are also probing whether IMEI certificates were generated by MSAI after they were directed to close ICDR operations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/eow-files-case-on-dot-complaint-as-firm-refuses-to-hand-over-imei-data/articleshow/86079484.cms||Abhay Singh

Sources with the tele counselling unit at the district collectorate told TOI that they were receiving at least five to seven phone calls from the people facing the problem after recovering from the viral infection. C Radhiga, medical officer at the counselling centre, said some women were facing severe hair fall after Covid-19 treatment. “We have advised them to take high-protein food, including boiled eggs. After four to five months, they could control the hair loss.” Pointing out that only a few people were treated with steroids for the infection, the officer said the hair loss issue was common to people after Covid infection. “At least five to six of the 20 calls that we receive a day raise the issue of hair loss. Stress is one of the factors for this. I have advised them to take a nutritious diet daily and do small exercises.”The tele counselling unit provides support to the public by addressing queries related to Covid-19 and mental health. Set up on June 24, it functions from 8am to 8pm on all days.“Many people contact us asking about vaccination schedules and doubts over getting inoculated. They often share with us their traumas. At least 307 families who lost one or two members to the infection have contacted us. They were in tears. Many people have lost jobs as well because of the pandemic situation.

---||Coimbatore||ANPR cameras to keep watch on city entry and exit points||Coimbatore: The city police are planning to cover all the entry and exit points in the city with automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras. The move comes in the wake of the struggle they faced in identifying the vehicle involved in the mysterious death of a woman. The woman’s body was run over by many vehicles after it was dragged by an unidentified multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) on Avinashi Road.It is to be noted that the city traffic police, in association with NGO Uyir, had earlier fixed ANPR cameras on Uppilipalayam-SITRA stretch to identify the vehicles involved in traffic violations. However, they were removed when the state highways department started the work on the elevated highway on Avinashi Road from Upplipalayam Junction to Goldwins. In the case of the woman’s death, it looked like the dead body was thrown off the MPV near Chinniyampalayam on Monday in the CCTV footage. The body, which was later run over by several vehicles, was then sent to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital for postmortem.Deepak M Damor, city police commissioner, said there was no sign of sexual assault or murder in the postmortem report. “We are trying to trace the identity of the deceased. It seems to be a case of hit and run and we will secure the people involved in the incident soon.”Police have formed two special teams to identity the deceased and the MVP. They have collected the CCTV footage that showed the dead body getting detached from the MPV. However, they were not able to identify the vehicle’s registration number.“The body was detached from the vehicle in the early hours of Monday. It was a rainy day and the vehicle used headlamps. So, the internet protocol cameras did not register the vehicle’s registration number. The visual clarity is also very poor because of the rain. So, we have been struggling to get details of the MPV for the past four days,” said a police source.In this wake, the city police commissioner said they had decided to fix ANPR cameras at the entry and exit points of the city. “We already have ANPR cameras and they will be fixed on the city border check posts - Chinniyampalayam, Selvapuram, near Saibaba Colony, Saravanampatti, Kamatchipuram and Sugunapuram.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/anpr-cameras-to-keep-watch-on-city-entry-and-exit-points/articleshow/86079450.cms||A Subburaj

State surveillance expert Dr Pradeep Awate said the state was registering around cases daily and there was no major spike. “Next week will be crucial, after the Ganesh festival starts. The department is keeping a close watch, especially on the districts registering higher weekly positivity rate (WPR) than the state average,” he said. “For the last two months, Maharashtra has been registering around 4,000-5,000 cases daily. So, all the districts, especially those of concern, have been asked to keep a close watch on the situation,” said Awate. The cabinet presentation this week highlighted that Pune, Thane, Satara, Ahmednagar and Mumbai have 70% of the active cases in the state. The public health department stated that eight districts had registered higher WPR than the state average of 2.67%. Awate said the state public health department had directed the officials in these districts to increase testing. State task force member Dr Shashank Joshi said the weeks during the festivities and after will have to be monitored. “People should follow Covid protocols because the cases went up after the Ganesh festivities last year,” he told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/health-dept-to-keep-a-watch-on-case-trend-positivity-in-dists-of-concern/articleshow/86081678.cms||Nisha Nambiar

To dissuade the cops, the accused later began unloading the cows that they had stolen. When the cops didn’t leave, they left their vehicle and fled. Many cops were injured and four PCR vans badly damaged.The gang has been notorious for snatching cars and mini trucks at gunpoint and then using these vehicles for committing robberies/dacoities on highways in the NCR and adjoining areas.Meanwhile, the south Delhi police arrested two Mewat-based cheats who had duped banks and their customers through forged debit cards. The accused have been identified as Akhtar Hussain and Irshad from Nuh in Haryana. Police have seized 19 debit cards from them.The accused have told police that they used to withdraw money from ATM kiosks and then disable the machines by holding on to the shutter of the money handover slot.

Several buildings of colleges are still being used as Covid care facilities and the decision on reopening the institutions will be taken after reviewing the pandemic situation,” said the minister. Samant, who was on an official tour of Aurangabad, refused to comment on why colleges are not allowed to reopen even if schools have resumed operations in rural areas of Maharashtra. “I can only of speak on higher and technical education. I don’t know who is right or wrong,” he said, when asked whether the school education department was right in allowing reopening of schools. “Considering the limitations on recruitment of teachers, we need such faculties working on a clock-hour-basis. These teachers working in both government and private colleges, will get a 25% rise in their honorarium. We have also formed a special panel to look into the welfare of the teachers and have asked them to submit the report within the next three months,” he said. The minister also said that his department has drafted a proposal to carry out recruitment for over 3,000 vacant posts in different institutions. “The necessary proposal has already been discussed with the finance department and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar,” he said when his attention was drawn to the teachers associations’ demanding and the threat of an agitation if the necessary posts are not filled. He also said that the Sant Vidyapeeth at Paithan will start its activities very soon as the chief minister has consented to be the chief guest for the proposed function planned on September 17.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/cm-taskforce-to-take-call-on-college-reopening-samant/articleshow/86074714.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: ‘Consult industry before imposing anti-dumping duty’||AHMEDABAD: Industry associations must be consulted before imposing anti-dumping duty on dye intermediates from other countries, the Associated Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Assocham) suggested in its report titled “Resilient and Sustainable Gujarat: Suggestions and Inputs on Routing Industries Back to Recovery Post Covid Second Wave”. Stating that India depends on China for import of raw materials used in the manufacture of dyes and dye intermediates, the report adds that many manufacturers of intermediates have formed a cartel and are insisting on imposing anti-dumping duty on imports of raw materials from other countries so they can increase the rates of the same raw materials manufactured in India. According to Assocham, this results in an increase in the price of finished products due to which the industry faces difficulty in competing in the national and international markets. “Therefore, anti-dumping duty must not be imposed on intermediates imported from foreign countries without consultation with the respective industry associations,” Assocham said in the report, which was released by the chief minister, Vijay Rupani, a couple of days ago. Gujarat is a leading producer of dye and dye intermediates. The state accounts for almost 75% of dyes and dye intermediates exported from India. The exports of dyes from the country increased by 33% to $247 million (Rs 1,803 crore) in July 2021 from $185 million (Rs 1,350 crore) in the same month last year, shows data compiled by Basic Chemicals, Cosmetics & Dyes Export Promotion Council (Chemexcil).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/consult-industry-before-imposing-anti-dumping-duty/articleshow/86079525.cms||---

The department is keeping a close watch, especially on the districts that have registered higher weekly positivity rate than the state average,” said state surveillance expert Dr Pradeep Awate. Pune, Thane, Satara, Ahmednagar and Mumbai districts are recording 70% of the active cases in the state. The health department said eight districts have registered a weekly positivity rate which is higher than the state average of 2.7%. Officials in these districts have been asked to increase testing. The state can carry out 3 lakh tests daily but at present, it is doing 1.5-1.6 lakh only. The state with over 50,000 active cases is second only to Kerala in the country. “We have to be cautious and even reverse the existing numbers. For this, increased testing will have to be continued with zero tolerance for crowding. While vaccination has picked up, there should be no false sense of security and double masking should be continued,” said Dr Shashank Joshi, member of the state task force.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/state-to-closely-monitor-covid-nos-especially-in-districts-of-concern/articleshow/86079575.cms||---

A proposal to install panels with the help of Solar Energy Corporation of India was approved at a standing committee meeting on Thursday. The project aims to facilitate the implementation of the National Solar Mission. “A draft Memorandum of Understanding for the project has already been prepared in consensus with SECI,” said EDMC commissioner Vikas Anand. “These plants are supposed to be installed on a revenue-sharing basis.” In 2018-19, solar plants of 325 KWP capacity were installed at 10 municipal buildings. Last financial year, EDMC managed to earn Rs 20 lakh after exporting the surplus power produced at these plants. “We have 220 schools, 70 community halls, 40 health department buildings, including hospitals and offices, which can be utilised for installation of solar panels on rooftops. The system offers sustainable energy, environmental benefits, has a low gestation period and distribution losses,” said EDMC standing committee chairman Bir Singh Pawar. “We will be able to save lakhs of rupees on electricity bills and generate some revenue, too.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/350-locations-in-e-delhi-to-have-solar-panels/articleshow/86079529.cms||Vibha Sharma

The man was refused bail even after his daughter filed an affidavit and told the court that she had filed a wrong complaint under pressure from her uncle and aunt following a property dispute. The complaint was filed in February 2008 in Ramol police station and the girl was 17 years of age then. The man remained absconding for 13 years and was arrested last month. As he sought bail, the daughter filed an affidavit and also told the court that she had levelled charges against her father under coercion from her aunt and uncle, who wanted to usurp her father’s house and jewellery. She asserted that her father is innocent. Public prosecutor Sudhir Brahmbhatt vehemently opposed the bail plea and maintained that the accused’s release could influence witnesses. after hearing the case, additional sessions judge H G Vaghela on Wednesday noted, “Considering fact that father is supposed to protect a girl child from predator but in the case on hand the father himself has become predator and has physically exploited his daughter. If the accused is enlarged on bail then there are all possibilities that he will again indulging sexual exploitation of her daughter.” The court further observed that the accused remained absconding since 2008 and his anticipatory bail was rejected in 2015. “His conduct points towards his guilt. This court has to be circumspect wherein such kind of allegations are levied since such type of offence are not only against law but also against morality and mankind and it shakes the conscience of this court,” the order reads.

Blaming Jinnah for partition of the country, spokesperson of BJP Aligarh unit Shivang Tewari warned that they would be forced to take down the portrait “if the AMU authorities did not remove it themselves”. In 2018, a similar demand had been made by party MP Satish Gautam. It had resulted in a clash with university students when activists of various right-wing organizations had tried to force their way into the campus to remove the portrait.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/aligarh-bjp-workers-seek-pms-help-to-remove-jinnahs-portrait-from-amus-students-hall/articleshow/86076972.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

For the past five years, Shankar Patil, 32, has cremated 500-600 orphaned, unclaimed bodies in and around the city. At the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, he performed the last rites of over 200 dead bodies. He along with his friends have been providing free cremation service to the poor, especially orphans. As soon as he received a call saying that the body of an orphan was found near Kakti, he and his friend left the place where they were celebrating the election victory. They carried the body in an ambulance to Sadashivanagar crematorium and performed the last rites. Patil was earlier driving auto rickshaw to support his family. Later, with the help of friends, he joined a pharmaceutical company as a medical representative. However, he always wanted to render social service and same thought was lingering in his mind. About five years ago, he discussed about cremating bodies of those who could not afford it. Patil told TOI, “We have cremated 500-600 bodies. At present cremation will cost Rs 500 – 1,000 and there are many who cannot afford the money. Besides orphans have no one to bury the bodies. I was recognised in my ward due to this work and how can I abandon my service just because I won the election?” Patil has two ambulances dedicated for transporting unclaimed bodies. During second wave of Covid, he said, he said he cremated over 200 bodies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/newly-elected-man-stops-celebrations-rushes-to-cremate-orphan/articleshow/86077518.cms||Basavaraj Meeshi

Accused Vikram Nayak was arrested the same evening after he admitted of strangulating grandmother Vesti to death in a fit of rage. According to the police, the elderly woman was living alone after her son passed away while Nayak was working in Saurashtra. Around three days ago, the accused returned to Waghodiya and he asked his grandmother to hand him ownership of the land to which she refused. The woman told him that the land was her only possession and if she would give it away, she would be left with no other source of income. Hearing this, enraged Nayak dragged the septuagenarian out of her house and thrashed her mercilessly before strangulating her to death. Neighbours saw Vesti’s body lying outside her house and informed cops who suspected it to be natural death at first.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/man-strangles-grandmother-in-waghodiya/articleshow/86076350.cms||---

A murder case has been registered against seven people, all related to the girl. The youth and his friend had gone to a village in neighbouring Sangli district for cattle trade and were returning to their village in Kolhapur on Wednesday night, when they were attacked. As per the complaint registered by his friend with Shirala police station, the attackers used metal and wooden sticks and sharp weapons to attack the youth. After brutally attacking him for a few minutes, they fled. Assistant police inspector Gajendra Lohar said, “The friend brought the youth to the Chhatrapati Pramila Raje Civil Hospital in Kolhapur. He was declared brought dead. We have identified the attackers and will be arresting them soon.” According to the police, the youth and the girl had an affair over the past year. In March, after the girl’s family opposed the relationship, the couple fled, but returned soon after. After returning, the girl’s relatives filed a complaint against the youth for allegedly abusing the girl. A case under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act was registered against the youth. The police, however, found no evidence of sexual abuse by the youth. The youth’s uncle told TOI, “The case was closed after police found nothing. We had then complained to the police that the youth was facing threat to his life. However, the police did not take any step.” His uncle and other relatives were reluctant to take the body until the police had arrested the attackers. After learning that the attackers had been identified and a murder case had been registered, the relatives took the body for final rites. The youth had started rearing buffaloes and was interested in cattle business. His father passed away five years back.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/panhala-youth-killed-over-affair-with-minor-girl/articleshow/86074939.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||SC seeks affidavit about construction on water body||AHMEDABAD: The Supreme Court on Thursday directed the state government to file an affidavit on whether the housing project for the economically weaker sections (EWS) has been built on a water body in the Tandalja area in Vadodara. The apex court sought an affidavit “explaining project development to the extent that no water body is to be utilized for any other purpose including for rehabilitation of slum dwellers”. The state authorities have been asked to file an affidavit in four weeks. Since the HC had given the go-head to the construction project, by allowing the authorities to de-notify part of the land, the SC has sought an explanation on whether construction has taken place on the water body. The issue was taken to the SC by an NGO, Paryavaran Mitra, after the Gujarat high court in July 2019 dismissed a PIL challenging the government’s decision to de-notify the water body in Tandalja in order to build houses on the land. By dismissing the PIL, the HC paved the way for a private developer to build houses for the poor on the water body, which was notified in 2005 as ‘talav/kharabo’ (lake/wasteland). The PIL claimed that 48,259 square metres was a recognized water body since 1952, and had urged the HC to restrain the government and Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) from putting up the housing scheme under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. In 2016, the VMC began the process of de-notifying the lake so that construction could be put up on the land. A huge settlement on this land, known as Sahkar Nagar, was removed in 2017 and 1,428 households were promised resettlement on the same plot. The VMC’s standing committee passed a resolution that the Sahkar Nagar slum would be developed under the housing scheme for EWS by Cube Construction Engineering Ltd. When the HC was moved, it was submitted by the government that a technical expert committee had reported that only 2,400 sq m of the 48,259 sq m of land had properties of a water body. Therefore, while allowing the authorities to de-notify the rest of the area, the HC ordered the government to undertake development and beautification of the 2,400 sq m area as a lake. The petitioner has been maintaining that the process of de-notifying a water body is illegal. Construction on 90% of the area of the lake and retaining only 10% of the water body is against the directions issued by the high court in 2002. The petitioner has also been arguing that judicial discipline demands that the court not deviate from earlier directions, which have been binding on the government as well as on courts. The petitioner has also contended that there are 55 such water bodies in various towns across that state where the authorities have planned EWS housing schemes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/sc-seeks-affidavit-about-construction-on-water-body/articleshow/86079586.cms||---

Among its many activities aimed at preventing suicide in Gujarat, the group recently took the initiative to organize Shiva Tandav every Monday in Shiva temples that helped spread the message of building mental resilience and preventing depression. Psychiatrist Dr Devjyoti Sharma, who is also part of national suicide prevention forum, told TOI that the group has been demanding formation of a national policy to prevent suicide since 2014. “I am part of the worldwide efforts to prevent suicide continued by international agencies like the World Congress of Psychiatry and also other international associations. Replying to our suggestions, the government has said that it is under consideration and if the policy finally takes shape, the government will also form action plans to fight against suicide,” he said. According to the forum, the policy will force administration to start evidence-based suicide prevention activities. In the current situation, in case of suicide, the file is closed once an accidental death is registered in the case. The policy will invite various research on age group, profession of people who commit suicide and how it can be prevented.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/frame-natl-policy-on-suicide-prevention/articleshow/86076807.cms||---

However, in spite of the global pandemic lockdown, the institute remained operational online and conducted everything, including its campus placements, remotely. “There are various parameters for judging the institute’s performance and the institute has improved on different areas. We are working on to improve the ranking further,” said S R Gandhi, director, SVNIT. The institute has recently completed recruitment of teaching staff and now attempts are being made to complete recruitment of non-teaching staff. “Due to Covid, the process got delayed. If our recruitment for non-teaching staff is completed in time our performance will improve further,” Gandhi added.

The Gujarat tourism department has proposed a hotel having more than 16 rooms in Vadnagar and is inviting bids from private parties. A senior officer handling the project said Vadnagar is a major Buddhist and heritage site and has potential to grow as a tourist centre. “However, the town does not have adequate hotel facilities and so the government has invited private players to build a new hotel in the town which will be close to the tourist attractions,” the officer said. “The railways also redeveloped the station recently. Every year, during the Tana Riri music festival, a lot of visitors come to the town, but have to go to Mehsana or other nearby towns to stay the night. The new facility will let tourists spend the night in Vadnagar, they can also visit places such as Modhera and Patan from there,” said the officer. The state government has also promised land to the hotel developers, officers said. “The government expects more than one hotel to come up in Vadnagar in the next couple of years,” sources added.

This year, the civic body has denied permission to 381 mandals while 143 applications were still under process on Tuesday. In the BMC’s D Ward (Grant Road), S (Bhandup), N (Ghatkopar), G-North (Dadar) and K-East (Andheri and Vile Parle East), more than 100 mandals each have received permission. This year, the number of permissions granted was higher than last year’s 1,700. Girish Walawalkar, secretary of the Brihanmumbai Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav Samanvay Samiti, said this year more restrictions have been laid out than last year. “The government has restricted physical darshan for small mandals as well. Not everyone is able to provide online darshan to devotees as they cannot afford the expenses that are involved, such as putting up a screen and getting the required connections. On one hand we are allowing the fully vaccinated to take local trains and on the other, we are restricting darshan for small mandals,” said Walawalkar. Samiti president Naresh Dahibavkar said in 2020, due to the pandemic, 90% of the mandals had applied for permission. “This year, the enthusiasm is back and 100% of the registered mandals had applied. However, following government restrictions on physical darshan, many mandals will find it very difficult to celebrate the entire festival with the same vigour which they would have wanted to,” he said. The BMC has also appealed to citizens to immerse idols in artificial ponds instead of seafronts and lakes. Earlier this week, the BMC issued new rules to be followed for Ganeshotsav. It banned all processions or gatherings and restricted the number of persons to just 10 for Ganpati mandals for visarjan or immersion and to just five for household idols.  The BMC has said if a household Ganesha idol is made of clay or is environmentally friendly, it should be immersed in a bucket or a drum at home, if possible. Besides, the immersion of the idols in a containment zones should be done inside the mandal premises itself or it should be postponed. The BMC has asked all mandals to refrain from stopping vehicles carrying idols anywhere on the roads during immersion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-close-to-2k-ganpati-mandals-get-civic-nod-for-ganeshotsav-2021/articleshow/86079676.cms||Richa Pinto

A senior police officer told TOI, “Her name has been included in the list of Indians returning from Afghanistan as per the ministry of external affairs. Now, they have asked for the birth certificates of Hina’s three children. We are in the process of collecting vital information, besides the birth certificate of her three children from her family members.” Samirunisha, a resident of Chunnan’s building located in Bagahi area of Babupurwa police station area in the city, had lodged a complaint recently that her daughter Hina Khan had gone to live with her uncle in Mumbai. Owing to financial constraints, she started working at a bar in Mumbai, where she met an Afghani national, Mohammad Ghani. It was alleged that Ghani developed a relationship with Hina and later married her and took her to Afghanistan. On August 28, Hina called her mother Samirunisha from Afghanistan and told her that Ghani had sold her to a person. She is being beaten and tortured, while Ghani himself has escaped to India. She said that she is trapped among the Taliban. Hina had three children from Ghani. While she gave birth to her elder son in Kanpur, two daughters were born in Afghanistan. The matter had attained significance after the information about Hina being trapped in Afghanistan. Subsequently, the city police had started the investigation. On Thursday, the commissionerate police had been informed about the development with regard to Hina’s return to India by the ministry of external affairs. Additional DCP South Anil Kumar said, “We received a call from the Afghanistan’s Special Cell of the ministry of external affairs, in which they were told that the name of Hina has been included in the list of the people who are to return to India from Afghanistan. The ministry has now sought details of her children.” They are with Hina in Afghanistan, and their passports are yet to be made. “We are now collecting information besides documents from Hina’s family members with regard to the birth certificate of the children,” the ADCP told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/city-woman-her-3-kids-stuck-in-afghanistan-to-return-india-soon/articleshow/86081811.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui
---||Kolkata||Suicidal calls to helpline double||KOLKATA: Calls to a tele-helpline from those who are in distress or feel suicidal have doubled since the onset of the pandemic a year-and-a-half ago while the number of high risk callers — those on the verge of taking their lives — has increased by over 10 times. “Our volunteers have been taking calls for 25 years now. Over the years, the number of calls has been around 15-20 while the average call duration has been around 30-45 minutes. Also, the volunteers would encounter one high risk caller in two-three months. The pandemic has changed all that. The number of calls has shot up to 30-40 a day while the call duration has increased to 60-90 minutes. And now there is a high-risk caller every week,” recounted Lifeline Foundation deputy director, Molly Thambi. The sharp rise in the number of calls from distressed and suicidal people has also impacted the volunteers who attend the calls. Lifeline had to organise a special training for volunteers to ensure they could cope with the rise in emotional stress. “The Covid had initially made us vulnerable but we have now become seasoned and emotionally stronger,” said Amitava Ray, who has been a volunteer with Lifeline for nearly 24 years. While 50% calls have been from people struggling to cope with Covid death in the family, there are also calls from people in financial distress owing to job loss or reduced income due to Covid. The worst period, volunteers say, was during last year’s lockdown and during the second wave earlier this year. “The ultimate trigger for suicide is the acute hopelessness, which an individual experiences when they have none to talk to, none around to listen to or understand their feelings of terrifying pain. The pandemic has made the situation more acute,” said Suksham Singh, who, along with her husband Ravinder, founded the helpline in 1996 after a setback in their life. The helpline with 56 volunteers operates from 10am to 10pm and offers confidential, non-judgemental and emotional support. “Wanting to end one’s life is not a continuous feeling. Most suicidal people are deeply conflicted about ending their own lives. There are moments of absolute hopelessness. And then there are times when the person wishes there was an alternative to suicide. Our volunteers try to convince the caller to give life another chance,” said Lifeline trustee Hiteshwar Singh. Thambi recollected a call she received from a person at Jatin Das Metro station, who wanted to know what Lifeline did. He said he was waiting on the platform for a train to arrive so that he could jump before it and end his misery. While gazing around, he chanced upon a helpline poster and called. “I pretended I was finding it difficult to hear and asked him if he could just step back a bit so that the signal would be clearer. Gradually, he retracted a bit and then a bit more till he was out of the station and conversing with me. That moment of utter despair had by then passed,” she recounted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/suicidal-calls-to-helpline-double/articleshow/86079701.cms||Subhro Niyogi

But there is nothing of that sort this time round,” said Chandannagar resident, who wanted a scooter for his wife. He returned without a vehicle, due to a long waiting period on the model of his choice.  “There is good demand from the customers’ end, and we have reached pre-Covid revenues. But there are issues on the supply side. The primary reason is that the cost of production has gone up, be it of material, or freight charges, or international shipping,” said Shailesh Bhandari of BU Bhandari Auto, which operates both four-and two-wheeler dealerships. “The effects of the shortage is more on the four-wheeler market than on two-wheelers. There is a good number of back orders to be serviced. The dealers are not holding a lot of inventory. They are not getting much from the manufacturers,” said Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations state chairman Amar Sheth said. Manufacturers such as Piaggio and Mercedes-Benz have announced some festive season offers. “As markets are opening, the recovery following the second wave has been good. We are introducing exciting products this festive season. But the challenge of shortage of semiconductors, compounded due to Malaysian Covid wave, may act as a dampener,” said a spokesperson for Tata Motors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/crippling-supply-chain-dampens-automobile-sales/articleshow/86081812.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

The responsibility of surveying the land, allegedly encroached upon, has now been entrusted to the deputy commissioners of Mysuru and Mandya. The two DCs can choose the officials they deem fit for the job, and submit a report.Both Mahesh and Mysuru district minister S T Somashekar had opposed Moudgil probing the allegations. However, Moudgil had pointed out that Mysuru regional commissioner (RC) C G Prakash had failed to probe all charges levelled against Mahesh, and had focussed only on the encroached land at a convention centre owned by the former minister’s family members.Mysuru DC Bagadi Gautham has been asked to look into allegations of encroachment of survey numbers on Keragalli, Yadahalli, Dattagalli and Kasaba in Mysuru, while his Mandya counterpart will probe allegations of encroachment in Belagola.According to an order issued by deputy secretary of revenue department, M E Channabasavaraju, the DCs have been asked to lead the probe team and submit a report of their investigation in three weeks. They have been authorised to get necessary documents from all government agencies.Acting on a complaint filed by Gangaraju, a committee was constituted by the commissioner of survey, settlement and land records to probe the allegations. Deputy director of land records, Mandya B G Umesh, Sujay Kumar and Lohith TK, his counterparts from Tumakuru and Davanagere districts respectively, were the other members of the committee. The committee has now been dissolved.Moudgil’s decision to order a probe into the allegations had stirred up a controversy with Somashekar and Mahesh questioning the bureaucrat’s authority to pass such a diktat. However, MLC and senior BJP leader Adagooru H Vishwanath had defended Moudgil.“I am not against the probe itself. But Munish Moudgil has no authority to order such an inquiry. That was why I opposed it. The DC is the custodian of government property, not the commissioner of land records,” Mahesh told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/revenue-dept-tasks-mysuru-mandya-dcs-to-probe-allegations-against-mahesh/articleshow/86074903.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune hospitals grapple with shortage of tocilizumab||PUNE: Hospitals treating severely ill Covid-19 patients are facing a shortage of tocilizumab — an anti-rheumatic drug found effective in counteracting the cytokine storm — an abnormal immune response. Shyam Pratapwar, assistant commissioner (drugs), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Pune, said, “There has been a shortage of tocilizumab for a week now. Unlike remdesivir, tocilizumab is still distributed to treating hospitals only against requirements through the district collectorate because it is an imported drug and its supply has always been erratic. We are doing our best to replenish the stock in Pune.” Patients getting referred to hospitals in Pune in sizable numbers from other places has led to the tocilizumab crunch. At present, over 90% of the admitted Covid-19 patients in the city are referred from rural parts of Pune and neighbouring districts. Noble Hospital’s infectious diseases expert Ameet Dravid said, “We are getting quite a few seriously ill Covid patients from adjoining districts like Ahmednagar and Solapur. Besides, young severely ill Covid patients are also being referred to us from hospitals in Baramati and other talukas in rural parts of Pune. Most of these serious patients need tocilizumab but there is a shortage.” Doctors are using other drugs in view of the shortage of tocilizumab. “There are certain anti-cancer, anti-ulcerative colitis and immunosuppressant drugs that we can use but studies have not proven them very useful in Covid.” “Tocilizumab supply has always been erratic. We have been using the drug subcutaneously in select patients,” said Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital’s infectious disease expert Parikshit Prayag.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/city-hospitals-grapple-with-shortage-of-tocilizumab/articleshow/86081835.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Mandals bring back creative idols & sets; darshan online||MUMBAI: Maharashtra is set to welcome its presiding deity Lord Ganesh with love and devotion at Friday’s Chaturthi. This year, at least a few organisers have revived their creativity, even though darshan for devotees is online. The oldest mandal of Ganesh Gully in Lalbaug, now in its 94th year, unveiled its attractive idol on Thursday. The 55-year-old Tejukaya Ganeshotsav nearby has depicted the deity in the form of a pujari, seated atop a hillock with a Shivling placed before him. Spokesman Rahul Dhumne said, “Lord Ganesh is seen praying to Lord Shiva to shower blessings on mankind and eradicate all the bad things, including coronavirus.” The Mumbaicha Maharaja of Khetwadi 11th Lane is celebrating its seminal 60th year with a beautiful idol cast in the mould of Shivaji Maharaj. “Sculptor Rajesh Mayekar has crafted this entirely from tissue paper, and the decorative artwork is by Nikhil Jamdade,” said mandal head Ganesh Vadvel. The 52-year-old Khetwadicha Raja of Khambata Lane, whose moorti usually rises to 24 feet, has pared it down to 4 ft. Lord Ganesha sits on a throne flanked by Riddhi amd Siddhi. “We will only host five people for aarti, and focus on sanitization. We will perform Sahastravartan and Shri Satyanarayan puja,” said mandal president Pawan Sharma. For most organisers, though, the downsizing of pandals precludes the possibility of putting up a grand theme or lavish decoration. The 70-year-old Shivdicha Raja mandal has curtailed its 10-day festivities to five, just as it did last year. “Government guidelines stipulate we must celebrate on a small scale. So our mandap is smaller and our moorti is 4 ft,” said organiser Vijay Indulkar. The oldest Ganeshotsav of Mumbai, the venerable Keshavji Naik Chawl in Girgaum, is in its 129th year. Through the decades, this mandal with a steady head on its shoulders has maintained a 2.25 ft idol. Its focus remains simplicity and public welfare. “Our team had been to Chiplun and donated a computer, printer, stationery and other educational material to a school run by the Shreeram Educational Society. Not a big thing, just a token of love and social responsibility,” said mandal president Bhushan Pokle. Meanwhile, the Lalbaugcha Raja mandal will unveil its moorti at 10.30am on Friday. Darshan will be available on its social media channels. President Balasaheb Kamble said, “We have downsized our idol to 4ft and installed railings. Now the responsibility (of preventing crowds) is up to the police.”  At Riddhi Ganesh Arts in Malad East, excited kids and first-time worshippers were among household devotees who arrived to take Bappa home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mandals-bring-back-creative-idols-sets-darshan-online/articleshow/86079723.cms||Bella Jaisinghani
---||Lucknow||Bansal: No office-bearer, dist in-charge should seek ticket||Lucknow: The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party’s selection of candidates for the Assembly polls 2022 is gradually taking an interesting turn. With the buzz going around that at least 50 to 60 sitting MLAs might not be repeated, the number of new candidates in each constituency trying their luck is increasing. However, after a warning by state BJP chief Swatantra Deo Singh to party leaders not to put up hoardings in their respective constituencies and claiming their candidature even when elections are months away, BJP’s general secretary (organisation), Sunil Bansal, dashed hope of several office-bearers and district in charges at the meetings held at party headquarters on Thursday by advising them not to seek tickets. Sources privy to the meeting told TOI that Bansal was categorical in the meeting when he said that no office-bearer or in charge of the district would be allowed to contest elections. Hence those who want to contest elections should resign from their respective posts, Bansal further said. A BJP leader, who was present in the meeting said that Bansal’s directive became talk of the meeting called to delve in detail about the programme ‘Seva Samarpan Abhiyan’ to be taken by the party from September 17, the birth date of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. A BJP leader privy to the meeting told TOI that when the organisation secretary began addressing the gathering, he said: “The district in-charges and office-bearers have been made to prepare the roadmap of the party in the run-up to assembly election. No in-charge or office-bearer should ask for a party ticket for the Assembly election. Those who still want to contest elections should resign from their responsibility and then seek a party ticket.” Ever since party insiders have begun talking that a large number of MLAs would be denied tickets to fight local anti-incumbency, the number of ticket-aspirants have increased. Many leaders have begun door-to-door contact while several others have begun putting up hoardings and posters. Some of the office-bearers and in-charges, too, were making an effort to get the party ticket. After Bansal’s advice, a party leader said that despite this diktat, there are party leaders who are both office-bearers and MLA. Another leader quipped that exceptions are everywhere and so are in the BJP. “If the leadership desires so, it would give tickets to the in-charge or office-bearer also,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bansal-no-office-bearer-dist-in-charge-should-seek-ticket/articleshow/86081862.cms||Rajiv Srivastava

In all, seven people from Tamil Nadu are arrested in the gang –rape of 22-year-old MBA student on August 24, on Lalithadripura hillock, next to Chamundi Hills. Five were arrested on August 28 and three days later another accused was detained. All these six were in police custody for more than a week as part of the investigation. They were handed over to judicial custody on Tuesday. Another accused who was arrested in Tamil Nadu’s Tiruppur district on Tuesday was brought to Mysuru on Wednesday. After producing him before a local court, police took him into custody for examination. An officer said the accused has been evading arrest for the last 10 days, after his identity was revealed. Sources said the youth in his mid-20s has admitted to the crime of sexually abusing the girl and assaulting her male companion. He had told police that they had been robbing people of their valuables on their way back to Tamil Nadu after work. A group of them working as daily wagers used to visit Mysuru in goods vehicles. They halted near secluded places to rob people even as they consumed alcohol in dark points. On the evening of incident, the group tried to extort money from them and as their efforts failed, they took to the heinous offence, a source said.

The minister said chief minister Vijay Rupani will provide the assistance money through direct benefit transfer (DBT) to 8,000 more such children, who lost their parents to the coronavirus or other serious disease from Rajkot, on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s birthday, September 17. The Mukhya Mantri Bal Seva Yojana was started in July for children who lost their parents to the pandemic. It was first decided to provide assistance of Rs 4,000 per month to 1,000 children who had lost both parents. It was later decided, on July 28, that assistance of Rs 2,000 would be given to children who lost one parent. On August 2, the government directly transferred Rs 2,000 to the bank accounts of about 4,000 such children through DBT. This scheme will apply till the children attain the age of 18.The minister said that since there has been a continual decline in the number of Covid cases after June 15, and case numbers were negligible by June 30, the state government had fixed June 30, 2021 as the cut-off date for the benefits, while August 31, 2021, was the last date for applying.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/8k-more-covid-orphans-to-get-aid/articleshow/86079755.cms||---

The name will be announced next week,” said Somaiya at a news conference here. “I have filed a complaint and am waiting for a reply. Details will be shared after a reply is received,” he said. Somaiya further questioned why state transport minister Anil Parab was still holding on to his post even after charges of illegal activities have been levelled against him. “Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray should explain why Parab is still in the state cabinet,” he said. He said that Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar has questioned actions by the enforcement directorate in the state against the leaders of MVA. The searches and actions are being initiated because investigations have revealed involvement of leaders in scams, said Somaiya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/will-name-one-more-minister-involved-in-scam-somaiya/articleshow/86081895.cms||---
---||Kolkata||40%-60% suicide victims visit docs before death||Kolkata: More than half of those, who choose to end their lives, visit a physician four to six weeks prior to their suicide — this stresses the need for recognition of the signs of extreme distress or despair among these people, say psychiatrists and experts. Other than the family, the society and their kin, non-specialist doctors, too, have a role in suicide prevention and need to be trained and sensitized about such patients, they pointed out. September 10 is observed as World Suicide Prevention Day. “Around 40%-60% of those dying by suicide visit a general physician shortly before ending their lives. In most cases, these doctors fail to recognize that they are in extreme distress, which could be dangerous. So, we need trained people to identify these potentially suicidal section of people and initiate measures,” said president of Indian Psychiatric Society Gautam Saha. He added that “gatekeepers” or people trained to identify someone contemplating suicide was necessary. Psychiatric J Ram said that busy, urban life was leading to a disconnect and isolation that often triggered suicidal tendencies. “A large number of youngsters, for instance, are under tremendous pressure to perform. Unfortunately, it is the parents who are often responsible for this. What they don’t realize is that education has nothing to do with doing well in exams. But that is exactly what students are expected to do. And those, who fail to live up to parents’ expectations, have to go through the stress that is harmful,” said Ram. A majority of those resorting to suicide are aged below 30 years. “We need to frame a mental health policy that will help to have a specific protocol of identifying and treating the depressed with suicidal tendency,” said Saha. Tolerance levels have come down drastically among youngsters today, claimed a psychiatrist. “They refuse to accept harsh criticism and often fail to handle emotional upheavals. Soft parenting has changed children’s attitude over the years. Till about a decade ago, parents could be very harsh with children without worrying about consequences. They would rampantly compare one child with another within the family or in the neighbourhood or school. But with time, interaction with children has turned more sensitive. But some parents continue to be an exception and they still stick to the old, rejected methods of driving children. The latter find it hard to accept when they find that their peers are being treated better,” he explained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/40-60-suicide-victims-visit-docs-before-death/articleshow/86079740.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

According to the Co-WIN data, Pune rural had registered its highest vaccination figure of 2.04 lakh doses on August 31 and 1.08 lakh doses were administered in a single day on September 7. The Pune rural has a target population of 36 lakh beneficiaries. Of them, a total of 23 lakh people have received the first dose so far. Ayush Prasad, the chief executive officer (CEO) of Pune zilla parishad (ZP), told TOI, “In the past few days, we have done exceptionally well on the vaccination front. But the challenges remain ahead of us. The manpower crunch and availability of the vaccine are the main issues we have to resolve to speed up the inoculation drive.” Prasad said they were functioning without over 1,800 staff members on contract (as their contract expired), assisting in health department activities. “From routine medical ailments to the vaccination, it has to be looked after by our regular staff,” he said, adding that the availability of the vaccine would play a major role. “In August, the Bajaj group donated 1.5 lakh doses, which helped us cross over 2 lakh doses in a single day. I would like to appeal to more corporates to donate vaccines,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/special-drives-boost-vaccine-coverage-in-dists-rural-areas/articleshow/86081875.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: ED case against Chhagan Bhujbal and another filed by ACB pending||MUMBAI: State cabinet minister Chhagan Bhujbal was on Thursday discharged by a special court in the Maharashtra Sadan scam case. On Wednesday, the same court had discharged Pankaj, Sameer and two others in a case where they were accused of cheating those who had purchased flats in a Navi Mumbai development project called ‘Hexworld.’ It was alleged 2,344 flats were sold and Rs 44 crore collected, but the project was not completed. In the Maharashtra Sadan scam case investigated by ACB, the defence team for the Bhujbals and others, advocates Prasad Dhakephalkar, Sajal Yadav and Sudarshan Khawase, submitted that the allegations were false and based on wrong calculations, assumptions and presumptions. A week after registering an FIR in the Maharashtra Sadan contract case in 2015, the ACB registered one more case against the Bhujbals for irregularaties in allotment of a Kalina plot to a private builder. The Kalina plot case is still pending before the court, and so is a money laundering case investigated by the Enforcement Directorate. On July 31, the court had also allowed the discharge pleas of five other accused, developers and architect Pravina Chamankar, Praneeta Chamankar, Prasanna Chamankar and Krushna Chamankar, along with former PWD engineer Arun Devdhar. The ACB had alleged that the government employees provided false and non-realistic information in a status report and prepared a false balance sheet showing a prospective profit of only 1.33% to the developer, when it was actually 365.36%. The court, however, had then observed that undue haste was made in lodging the FIR, and the ACB officer’s assessment of profit made by the developer and implied losses suffered by the state government, without taking assistance of an expert, was improper and illegal. The court said from the chargesheet and papers, it appeared most calculations have been made by the informant Narendra Talegaonkar, who was working as ACP in ACB, Mumbai division. The court said he was neither an architect nor an engineer. The court said at the outset, there was no evidence Rs 13.5 crore was paid by the developer itself to Chhagan Bhujbal and his son, nephew, and staffers and their family members who are accused in the case. It also said there is no material, prima facie, showing there was a meeting of minds of all public servants and that they hatched a plan to prepare a status favourable to the developer. The court also pointed out that twice—in May and August 2006—the report went to the committee comprising then CM Vilasrao Deshmukh, Bhujbal, transport and development ministers and seven senior bureaucrats. The court said it is difficult to accept that they were misled by the improper and incorrect submissions. Four accused remain. The case concerns a contract Bhujbal allegedly gave K S Chamankar Enterprises without inviting tenders when he was PWD minister. Activist Anjali Damania, the original complainant, tweeted she was going to move the Bombay high court against the orders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ed-case-against-bhujbal-and-another-filed-by-acb-pending/articleshow/86079791.cms||Rebecca Samervel

The children were being taken in different sleeper coaches under the custody of 11 men –two of them claimed to be associated with madrassas in Saharanpur (UP) and Bathinda (Punjab). All the children belonged to poor families in West Bengal and Bihar. A few men accompanying them claimed to be their family members but failed to provide sufficient evidence. The Childline team has taken custody of the children and have sent them to a shelter home. Their counselling will be done by the Child Welfare Committee (CWC) on Friday. Shahjahanpur’s GRP in-charge Fazal-Ur Rehman told TOI, “The men accompanying them said that the madrassas in Bihar and West Bengal shut down because of Covid, which is why they were being taken to madrassas in western UP and Punjab for their education. We have handed over the rescued children to the Childline team and the CWC for taking appropriate action as per law.” Vinay Sharma, coordinator, Childline team, told TOI, “The men accompanying the children didn’t have documents to support their claim of being their relatives. In fact, they didn’t even have any documents.” Mukesh Parihar, a member of CWC Shahjahanpur, said, “The action was initiated on the complaint of Surya Prakash Mishra, state convenor of NGO ‘Bachpan Bachao’. The children were scared and were not able to answer our questions. We are contacting their parents and will do their counselling after they are made comfortable. It is unfortunate that the state anti-human trafficking team didn’t take any interest in this case and has not registered any FIR against the men who accompanied the children on the train.” Earlier, on July 26, Uttar Pradesh police busted a child trafficking racket with the arrest of 16 persons in Aligarh and rescued six kidnapped children. Two of these children had gone missing from Ghaziabad and four from Aligarh. On July 1, 12 children being taken to Punjab from Bihar allegedly to work as labourers were rescued and five people arrested in Lucknow's Chinhat. On the same day, in another case, around 40 children were taken off a Punjab-bound train at Moradabad. On June 25, 33 children were rescued from North-East Special Express at Prayagraj station in UP. It was found that the minors were being brought to Delhi to work in various factories.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/18-children-from-wb-bihar-rescued-from-avadh-assam-express-in-shahjahanpur/articleshow/86077099.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

---||Lucknow||Lucknow University to hire 199 teachers, end crunch||LUCKNOW: A year after issuing the advertisement for hiring 188 teachers, Lucknow University on Thursday released a fresh one, resetting in motion the recruitment process after the earlier one was scrapped in June. This time LU has advertised 199 permanent posts lying vacant. The decision came as a relief for over 5,000 applicants who had applied earlier, as well as the students who can hope for a better teacher-taught ratio by the end of the year. TOI has been consistently raising the issue of shortage of faculty in LU. LU had advertised 180 posts in September last year, but the process was stalled first due to litigation and then again because of change in selection rules. The advertisement was finally cancelled in June. Now, 199 posts have been advertised. These include the 188 posts advertised earlier as well as 19 more which fell vacant due to superannuation of teachers this year. The last date for filing applications for 87 posts of assistant professors, 70 of associate professors and 42 of professors in various departments is September 30. About 5,024 candidates who had applied earlier need not to apply afresh. They can add their qualifications if they have earned more degrees or experience in the past one year. The entire process will be online. “All the vacant posts, barring those in the education faculty, have been advertised. We have to consult the state government on some rules related to selection for education faculty posts, which can be advertised later when the issue is resolved,” said registrar Vinod Kumar Singh. LU has been facing an acute shortage of teachers for a long time. At present, about 200 (39%) permanent posts out of 516 are vacant. The teacher-student ratio is 1:39 though the ideal ratio prescribed by the University Grants Commission is 1:20. Full faculty strength will help LU get good grades in the National Assessment Accreditation Council (NAAC) assessment. The last assessment was done in 2014 in which LU got ‘B’ grade. Even then LU was facing a shortage of teachers. Now, the university has applied for re-assessment. The filling up of vacant faculty positions will improve the quality of teaching and play a crucial role in implementation of National Education policy 2020 from the coming session. Make roster system public: LUTA Lucknow University Teachers’ Association (LUTA) has demanded the university authorities to make public the roster system adopted for teachers’ appointments. LUTA president Prof Vineet Kumar Verma said LU should upload the roster on its website for greater transparency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lu-to-hire-199-teachers-end-crunch/articleshow/86081945.cms||---

The accused, Abhishek Kumar Pandey, and the woman, to whose aid Chatterjee had rushed, are set to tie the knot soon. It later turned out that Pandey and the woman, a bank executive, were having a tiff when Chatterjee was driving by with her husband Deep Satpathy. Chatterjee thought the woman was in danger and jumped to her rescue. Pandey, while trying to flee in panic, had run over Chatterjee’s leg, leading to fracture. Refusing to comment on the bank executive’s decision to marry Pandey, Chatterjee said she had waited a year to get justice. “I have been recuperating from the injury for a year. But we have always believed we would get justice. We did not initially know that the accused had received bail. Since there was no movement in the case, my husband spoke to the joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma. The latter contacted me and assured that justice would prevail,” said Chatterjee, adding that the conviction of the accused would inspire others to step forward when a fellow citizens was in distress. Cops had submitted the chargesheet within 34 days of the incident, Among the charges slapped were attempt to murder, voluntarily causing hurt, voluntarily causing grievous hurt and causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/after-one-year-cops-speak-to-nilanjana/articleshow/86079827.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

In an official order on Wednesday, the DM said the dress code was being introduced because employees were often seen wearing jeans and T-shirts in meetings with higher officials. “This is damaging the reputation of the district administration and sending out a wrong message in the society,” the order said. Last year, the Maharashtra government had imposed a ban on the wearing of T-shirts and jeans by the employees in the state secretariat and government offices.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/jeans-t-shirts-banned-for-govt-employees-in-bageshwar-dm-warns-of-action-against-those-violating-dress-code/articleshow/86077141.cms||---

Following a complaint lodged by a social activist, the ACB had registered a criminal case against Bhujbal alleging that there was large-scale corruption in allotment of contract for construction of the Maharashtra Sadan. After the ACB registered the case, the ED too booked him under the PMLA and arrested him on March 16, 2016, while he was released on May 4, 2018. His nephew Samir too was arrested and released on bail on the same date. Bhujbal successfully contested the 2019 assembly elections and was inducted in the state cabinet led by Uddhav Thackeray. “The court did not find evidence against me, therefore I have been discharged. I am grateful to the judiciary as well as the CM for inducting me into the cabinet. Ever since the case was registered, ACB did not find any evidence against me. False cases were registered against our family, and in addition, we had to face a media trial,” Bhujbal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-can-trouble-truth-cant-defeat-it-says-bhujbal/articleshow/86079844.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Rains disrupt construction work at Ranipokhari bridge||Dehradun: Consistent rains made it tough to complete the construction of a permanent structure for passing the river water at Ranipokhari bridge, claimed Public Works Department (PWD) officials. A part of the alternate bridge built by the agency had also collapsed due to incessant rain on Tuesday morning. The work was affected even on Wednesday due to a rise in the water level of the river. The traffic coming from Rishikesh, too, was diverted to other routes. After the alternate bridge had collapsed due to the sudden flow of water following rains on the morning of September 7, the PWD officials had repaired the bridge while the construction of a permanent structure for water flow was being constructed. Officials said that they hope to complete the remaining repair work within a day so that traffic movement on the stretch between Dehradun and Rishikesh through the route can be normalised. Due to the rains, the work has to be held till the water level reduces and makes the condition safe for work and movement of traffic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/rains-disrupt-construction-work-at-ranipokhari-bridge/articleshow/86077202.cms||Abhijeet Singh

The department has taken several initiatives to cover at least 50 % of the targeted recipients of all age groups in Sangam city by September 15. The district-level mega vaccination drive will help health officials to achieve this target. Health authorities have aimed to cover around 75,000 recipients of all age groups at more than 300 sites on Friday. Till September 8, as per the health department, jabs have been given to 20,64,303 recipients, including 16,40,515 recipients of first dose and 4,23,788 recipients of second dose. The district health authorities have set a target to administer jabs to 46.10 lakh beneficiaries. Till September 7, it has already crossed the 20.64 lakh mark. As many as 5,81,207 recipients were vaccinated in the month of August alone. The number of recipients who got vaccinated till June 1 was 5,81,234, which rose to 8,84,249 on June 30, said a senior health official. Till July 1, a total of 8,52,932 people were vaccinated.

---||Pune||Lockdown, financial stress bring adoptions in India to five-year low||PUNE: Months of Covid lockdown last year brought down India’s in-country adoptions of children to a five-year low in 2020-21, Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA) data showed. From 3,351 in-country adoptions in 2019-20, the figure dropped to 3,142 in 2020-21, the lowest since 3,011 in 2015-16. Maharashtra saw 157 adoptions between April 2020 and March 2021, a steep drop compared to 538 in the April 2019-March 2020 period, data from the state women and child development department showed. In 2013-14, 1,068 children (in-country) were adopted from Maharashtra. Adoption agencies and CARA steering committee members said long pending lists of parents waiting for adoption approval as well as inter-state travel restrictions imposed during a significant period in 2020 caused the numbers to fall. A source from a Pune adoption agency told TOI that the lockdown and the financial stress it caused led to an increase in the number of illegal adoptions besides forcing agencies to reduce the number of children they accept for adoption. Another adoption agency said the number of intercountry adoptions was also affected due to the pandemic. A source from an adoption agency said, “Last year after the pandemic struck, the Supreme Court had directed state authorities to provide adoption centres with Covid safety paraphernalia such as masks and sanitizers. But these were not provided to us. The pandemic year has been hard to survive due to the financial burden. This is one reason why we have also reduced taking in children, especially when they have to wait at the agency for months for adoption clearance.” Prajakta Kulkarni, member of CARA steering committee and director of Snehankur Adoption Centre, told TOI, “Prospective adoptive parents couldn’t come from other states to Maharashtra during the lockdown. Inter-district and inter-state travel restrictions caused many adoptions to be put on hold. It is anyway very complicated to have a child adopted due to the complex paperwork. The pandemic restrictions further extended the waitlist. We have been urging the authorities to make adoption procedure easier.” A representative from another adoption agency said, “Inter-country adoptions were also affected during the pandemic. Two children with us were ready with passports to be sent to another country with their prospective parents. But they had to wait at the adoption agency for several months as they were not getting their visas because of the curbs on foreign travel.” A CARA official said, “When the pandemic began last March, the April-June quarter recorded just 100 adoptions in India as against an average of 900 in a quarter. The following quarter also recorded relatively fewer adoptions. Adoptions picked up significantly in the last quarter of 2020. Extra efforts such as expedited home visits were put in the subsequent quarters starting from July 2020, which helped adoptions pick up.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pandemic-year-sees-lowest-child-adoptions-in-india-after-2015-16/articleshow/86081940.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Kolhapur||‘Hold vaccine drives at crowded spots’||Kolhapur: Kolhapur collector Rahul Rekhawar has asked the officials to start vaccination drives at crowded places, such as bus stops and railway station, in order to increase the coverage during the festival period. Rekhawar has also asked the authorities to hold vaccination camps at the ward level in towns and cities. The directions have come in anticipation of a likely dip in the turnout of the beneficiaries for vaccination during the 10-day Ganesh festival starting from Friday. The administration has stocked vaccine doses after opening up vaccination for 18 to 44 years age group. At the start, there was much enthusiasm in this age group but now it has waned in both rural parts of the district and in Kolhapur city. Most of the slots remaind open every day. Rekhawar said, “There is a need to expand vaccination drive given the anticipation of the third wave of Covid. I have asked authorities to get local representatives, social organisations involved to expand vaccination and creating awareness among people. To start with the vaccination sessions will be scheduled at the crowded places and at ward levels.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/hold-vaccine-drives-at-crowded-spots/articleshow/86075009.cms||---

With the pace of the vaccination drive picking up, the remaining beneficiaries too will be fully vaccinated soon. The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has about 13.6 lakh beneficiaries above the age of 18 years. “Of them, more than 4.8 lakh, or 35%, have received both the vaccine doses. This is a good thing to happen as the pace of vaccination has picked up,” said Jadhav. Moreover, about 9.1 lakh (67%) eligible beneficiaries have received the first dose. The NMC has 145 vaccination centres and there are more than 20 private hospitals that are part of the vaccination drive. Recently, vaccine availability has improved and the pace of the drive has picked up. “At this point, protection is a major tool to fight the infection. It is best to ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour at all times and get the jabs that will at least reduce the criticality of the infection,” Jadhav said. The officer also pointed out that the NMC was gearing up to fight the expected third wave of the pandemic, but people need to take care of themselves. The officer also said that the vaccination programme was getting a good response from the people. The NMC officials pointed out that as many as 105 pregnant women have been administered the first dose so far, while 25 have got their second shots too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/35-beneficiaries-got-both-jabs-nmc-chief/articleshow/86075029.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Allahabad||New water pipelines in seven zones of the city||Prayagraj: In the backdrop of the fact that various localities of the Sangam City have been facing the problem of potable water because of either damaged water pipelines or in the absence of the same, now the authorities of Jal Sansthan, Prayagraj have decided to lay down over 77-kilo meters of water pipeline in different localities of the city and solve the problem. Jal Sansthan had earlier conducted an extensive survey of Seven zones of the city which had reported to have repeated problems of potable water. After carrying out the survey, it has been decided that the seven zones will be provided with new water pipelines and the total length of which would be 77.2 km. According to the general manager of Jal Sansthan, Harishchand Balmiki, the localities include Kareli, Atala, Alahapur, Daraganj, Alopibagh, Malviya Nagar, Dariyabad, Sadiyapur, Lukerganj, Mumfordganj, Transport Nagar, Katra, Kanhaipur, Rajroopur and areas of Naini and Phaphamau. “We would not only replace the damaged or dilapidated pipelines with the new one but will also lay these water pipelines in the areas which were devoid of the same”, said the official. Earlier, the GM had sent a proposal to the Prayagraj Municipal Corporation and the same has now been approved. The project would cost around Rs 15 crores and the work for the same would start this week itself. As per the details, zone One (Khuldabad) would be provided with 22.07 km of pipeline, zone two (Muttiganj) 11.66km, zone three (Katra) with 14.53km, zone four (Allahapur) 13.69km, zone five (Naini) 14.35km, zone six (Bamrauli) 11.27km and zone seven (Phaphamau) with 23.50 km of pipeline. These localities had earlier reported several complaints of the problem of clean drinking water and the major cause of the same was old pipelines which get damaged at places, inviting contaminated drinking water. With new pipelines as well as the damaged or rusted pipelines being replaced by fresh pipes, authorities believe that the problem of potable water in these localities would be solved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/new-water-pipelines-in-seven-zones-of-the-city/articleshow/86081998.cms||---
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Lookout notices for Narayan Rane’s wife, MLA son in loan case||PUNE: Maharashtra home minister Dilip Walse-Patil on Thursday said the Pune police have issued look-out notices on September 3 to prevent Nilam Rane, wife of Union minister Narayan Rane, and their MLA son, Nitesh, from leaving the country as their presence was needed for the investigation relating to an alleged financial loan fraud case. “The state government had received a letter from the central government, which was in response to a complaint application by a person. The letter was forwarded to the home department and the police for appropriate action. The notices have been issued on the basis of this letter,” Walse-Patil told reporters. He did not mention the complainant’s name. Both Nilam and Nitesh, along with a company which runs a chain of hotels, are coborrowers of a Rs40 crore loan from DHFL Corporation and they have still to repay Rs 34.09 crore of this amount, a Pune police officer said. Nitesh Rane later tweeted that they would move the Bombay HC to quash the notices. Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta told TOI, “The state director general of police directed the city police to issue look-out notices for the Ranes. There is no police case registered against them in Pune. We have followed the standard procedure in issuing notices as per the directives.” In a video tweet, Nitesh Rane said they would move the Bombay high court to quash the look-out notices. He said they had approached the financial institution five months ago to settle the loan. He found the notices surprising and wondered why they had been issued by the Pune police when the loan matter was in Mumbai. Walse-Patil also announced that an independent cyber police station will be set up under the Pimpri Chinchwad police commissioner’s office. Cybercrime is on the rise and the government has opened 45 cyber labs in the state to deal with the situation. He said the government has started the process of recruiting 5,200 police personnel to increase the state’s police manpower. In the next phase, 7,000 policemen will be recruited. On police cases registered against the Maratha Kranti Morcha members demanding reservation in education and jobs, Walse-Patil said, “The government has moved the courts for withdrawing 109 cases. The other cases registered against the members will soon be withdrawn.” On tapping phones of politicians, the minister said, “Under the chairmanship of the DGP, a committee has been constituted and its report is expected this week. On the basis of recommendations made in the report, the government will take a call.” Asked about the gang-rape incident in Pune, the home minister said, “Enacting laws is not sufficient. The police needs to take effective steps to control crime. The Shakti Bill will be implemented after it is passed in the coming assembly session.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pune-police-issue-look-out-notices-against-ranes-wife-son-over-loan/articleshow/86081987.cms||Mihir Tanksale

His family had approached the Delhi high court with the allegation that jail officials were complicit. On Wednesday, the high court said it was “unfathomable” why the jail doctor didn’t spot multiple injuries, a probe was needed into “the role of jail doctors” and transferred the case to the CBI. “We had persuaded him to surrender, fearing he’d be killed in an encounter. Never thought he would be killed in jail,” said Geeta Devi, Ankit’s mother who is the pradhan of Khaila village. “A proper investigation will get us justice.” Those in his village, too, pin their hopes on a fresh investigation. “He may have been a criminal but didn’t deserve to die like this,” said Mukesh Kumar, former gram pradhan. “We are happy the high court has taken action. We believe the CBI will do the rest.” Ankur said his brother was being pressured into paying jail officials to be able to use his phone. “They’d ask for Rs 1 lakh a month. This, apart from demands every now and then, which would run into thousands. We were unable to pay. The jail staffers would hurl caste slurs at him. He resisted. And paid with his life."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/relieved-that-hc-transferred-ankit-gujjar-death-case-to-cbi-kin-say-they-hope-for-justice-now/articleshow/86077237.cms||Sandeep Rai

Together with the private hospitals, we are planning to admit about 14,000 people per day,” said NMC commissioner Kailash Jadhav. He said the number of beds, oxygen and ventilators is being planned meticulously so that people do not face problems. “The experts have warned that the third wave could strike more people and hence all precautionary measures are being taken,” he said. The NMC has readied 4,730 general beds, 7,109 oxygen and ICU beds, and 679 ventilator beds totalling 12,518 beds across the private and the civic body run establishments. The commissioner said a large number of beds is being prepared with oxygen support so that people get treatment wherever and whenever required. “There were cases where people had to run around for oxygen beds. So we have decided to turn the beds housed in the erstwhile Covid care centres in Thakkers’ Dome, Sambhaji Stadium and at Ambad into oxygen beds,” he said. The NMC was raising 22 pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen plants, which would ensure 23.22 metric tonne of oxygen per day. Of these, 10 are being funded through corporate social responsibility (CSR) while NMC is spending on the remaining ones. “A total of 12 PSA plants have been installed while machinery has been received for nine others and in case of one plant, the same will be available soon. We expect the systems to be ready by September-end,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-ensures-more-than-12500-beds-for-3rd-wave/articleshow/86075049.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Last-minute rush for flowers, sweets before Ganesh Puja||KOLKATA: Thursday saw a last minute scramble to purchase flowers, sweets and other paraphernalia a day before Ganesh Chaturthi. The flower market at Mullickghat below the Howrah Bridge witnessed a surge in the number of customers on Thursday morning. People purchased marigold and Dhurva grass in bulk, which are traditionally used during the Ganesh puja. Local markets in various neighbourhoods too witnessed a rise in footfalls with people coming in to buy things like beetle leaves, incense sticks, banana stems and rice that are needed for the puja. “People have been coming to buy flowers since early in the morning. Several shop owners have purchased in bulk, which they will then sell across the city. Today the entire stock was sold by 11am,” said Prashanta Hait, a flower seller in the Mullickghat flower market. Sweet shop owners were racing against time to meet the deadline of orders. “In the past few years, the demand for sweets has gone up during Ganesh Puja. Earlier, there were only very few pujas in the central business district. Now that the numbers have gone up, the demand for sweets offered as prasad to people has gone up too,” said Akash Tewari Brothers in Kalakar Street. The popularity of modak, a traditional sweet that is offered to the deity in Maharashtra, has caught up in Kolkata too, where many sweet shops have started selling it during this time. “People offer modaks too along with laddoos, which has been traditionally offered to Ganesh in Kolkata. We are getting a lot of orders for modaks in the run-up to Ganesh Puja for the past few years,” said a representative of Blaram Mullcik and Radharaman Mullick. At Potters’ Enclave of Kumartuli, activities continued till late in the evening with many organisers coming to ferry the deity to the pandal in their neighbourhoods. Several first timers scouted for good deals on ready-made idols. “This is for the first time that we are organising Ganesh puja in our complex, so we decided to opt for a smaller idol since the decision was taken late,” said Meenakshi Agarwal, a resident of Bangur Avenue. Several community Ganesh puja organisers bought bigger idols this time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/last-min-rush-for-flowers-sweets-before-ganesh-puja/articleshow/86079879.cms||Zeeshan Javed

Station house officer (Lisarigate) Ramsajeevan told TOI that after the woman’s allegations of rape on Monday, the accused was arrested and kept in lock-up. “But when we spoke to the woman and interrogated her, she admitted she had pressed charges under family’s pressure after the man refused to marry her. The two were in a relationship,” said the SHO. Police officers then spoke to both families who decided to solemnise the marriage “as soon as possible”. “A maulvi was brought to the police station by the families on Tuesday while a lawyer was also present,” said the police officer. Refreshments were also served at the thana with help of police. When asked if it was a misuse of the law by the woman, the SHO said “due procedure was followed” and that “we cannot stop anyone from withdrawing a case”. “A woman alleging rape had to be attended to so an FIR was registered. Later, the two families resolved the issue. It was a love affair and marriage was part of the compromise so we helped them. It is good if people forget their differences and get united.” The woman’s statement will now be recorded under section 164 CrPC (The Code Of Criminal Procedure) where she will withdraw the charges, said police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/man-held-after-woman-alleges-rape-day-later-thana-turns-into-nikah-venue/articleshow/86077295.cms||Ishita Mishra

The city has witnessed a rise in dengue and chikungunya cases over the past month and the members of the standing committee, that met on Thursday, raised the issue demanding immediate action. “It is surprising that the NMC officer has failed to carry out the tender process for spraying and fogging, and instead chose to allow the contractor — whose term had ended in 2019 — to continue. Therefore, we have ordered the transfer of the officer with immediate effect,” said Ganesh Gite, the chairman. The term of the contract had ended in August 2019, but the contractor had challenged some conditions in the court and managed to get a stay. Gite said the NMC should have considered issuing a fresh tender after the mandatory six-month period of the stay had lapsed. Besides, the NMC should have also presented its contention in the court and prayed for the earliest resolution over the past one-and-a-half years. When the panel asked the officer to present his side, the officer said the NMC’s statement was recorded with the court about five days ago because of issues related to Covid. The panel, however, refuted his argument saying valuable time had been lost. Gite ordered the transfer of the officer and retendering of the spraying and fogging process.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-panel-for-transfer-of-health-officer/articleshow/86075082.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Police have named Asaduddin Owaisi and his unidentified organising board members in the FIR. Superintendent of police, Barabanki, Yamuna Prasad, said that while addressing a crowd at Mohalla Katra Chandna on Thursday, Owaisi made incendiary speech in which he said that a 100-year-old mosque was demolished by the administration in Ram Sanehighat and its debris was also completely removed and hidden. By saying so, Owaisi deliberately tried to provoke a particular community and disturb the communal amity of the place. Prasad also said that in his speech Owaisi also made indecent and baseless remarks against the Prime Minister, government of India and the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh. “A large crowd had also gathered during the rally in which the organisers were neither wearing masks nor the social distancing norm was followed,” added the SP. An FIR for promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language has been lodged against Owaisi and his team members. They have also been booked for ‘negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life and malignant act likely to spread infection of disease’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/aimim-chief-booked-for-hate-speech-covid-curb-violation/articleshow/86082012.cms||---

The accused are aged between 75 and 80. Acquitting Shyam Sunder Chhawchharia, Suresh Gupta and Rajendra Karundia, the special court said, “Whatever evidence available on record is brittle which does not inspire the confidence…this court is of the considered view that the prosecution has failed to establish the charge against the accused beyond reasonable doubts.” Four accused, including two senior bank officers, died during pendency of case. The case against the eighth accused person has been stayed by Bombay high court. Hemkuta Industrial Investment Co Ltd was also named in the case. The court said that since it is sold out, no order was to be passed against it. The FIR was registered by the CBI, ACB in 1992 on a fraud that took place in 1989. It was alleged that at that time among the accused, assistant general manager Motilal Motwani, senior manager Bhadresh Kumar Desai and officer Gopal Makhija were posted at UCO Bank’s main branch. Another accused Sushil Morarka, since deceased, was the director of the company. It was alleged that Morarka, Chhawchharia, the then account’s clerk in the company, Gupta, an accountant and Harilal Poddar, manager (commercial) of Munirabad Chemical Co and Karundia, director of Silvering Roadways Pvt Ltd, entered into a conspiracy with the bank officials to cheat UCO Bank. They allegedly submitted false and fake documents for credit facilities sanctioned to Hemkuta Industrial Investment Co Ltd. Bank officials working as public servants were accused of abusing their official positions and granting credit facility without verification of genuineness of the documents. The prosecution examined eight witnesses and produced documents over three decades old. “If evidence available on record is carefully assessed, it indicates that all witnesses have not stated any incriminating circumstances against the present accused. Mere fact that the accused admitted some documents does not mean that guilt of accused automatically proved,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-3-accused-of-duping-bank-of-rs-45l-acquitted-after-30-years/articleshow/86082036.cms||Rebecca Samervel

On a Rs 12-lakh loan he had taken, an interest of Rs 37 lakh had piled up over two years. Unable to repay the debt and forced to sell his house, he hanged himself and his family to death in June. Akhilesh Gupta, 42, was a wholesale supplier of medicines. Two years ago, his business was on the verge of collapse. He needed money, and fast. A middleman, Avinash Vajpai, helped him secure a Rs 12-lakh loan from two lenders, Sushil Kumar Gupta and Mithlesh Kumar, at 15% monthly interest. After two years, with a Rs 37-lakh interest adding up, Akhilesh sold his house, valued at about Rs 50 lakh, to Avinash and started living there as a tenant. But when Avinash sent him a legal notice to vacate the house, it was possibly the last straw. He, his wife and two kids, 12 and 9, were found hanging on June 7. The lenders and the middleman were arrested for abetting their suicide. Now, police have added Gangster Act charges. “It was an organised crime. Any crime committed by more than one person in an organised manner can attract Gangster Act charges. We want to send out a strong message,” Shahjahanpur SSP S Anand said. He told TOI that the family had left a suicide note implicating the lenders. “We investigated the allegation and arrested them. They tried to get bail but we pursued the matter in court. This is the first time Gangster Act has been invoked against moneylenders in Shahjahanpur. We are taking complaints against predatory lenders seriously.” Akhilesh’s cousin Shalu Gupta said the charges were “justified”. “They had made his life miserable. We are happy the police charged them under the Gangster Act,” she told TOI. A police officer told TOI that predatory loans have been a problem in which the most vulnerable sections are most at risk. “There are rickshaw pullers and masons who take as little as Rs 5,000 and end up paying daily interests. One of the main reasons behind the predatory rates is that the borrowers can’t give anything as security,” the cop said. “Many don’t get support from banks. Middlemen step in and profit. These groups also take help from local goons to pressure borrowers."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/rs-37l-interest-on-rs-12l-loan-man-kills-self-kin-lenders-booked-under-gangster-act/articleshow/86077289.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

The district administration, the Nashik Municipal Corporation, and the police have requested residents and festival organisers to maintain Covid-appropriate behaviour given the possibility of a third wave. Municipal commissioner Kailas Jadhav said while celebrating the festival, the mandals, as well as the general public, must ensure that all Covid measures are followed. “Our squads will be out on the road to check if there is any violation of Covid guidelines. But it is also the responsibility of the mandals and people to follow the safety protocols,” said Jadhav. On Thursday, the markets in the city were teeming with people who flocked the shops to buy Ganapati idols and other items to perform rituals and decorate their homes. At some places, there were traffic jams too. “Compared to last year, the sale of Ganapati idols is higher this time. Our buyers are those who offer prayers at their homes,” said Santosh Shaharkar, the president of the Nashik idol makers’ association, who has himself sold about 4,000 idols over the past couple of days. Last year, he had been able to sell only about 2,000 idols. Echoing similar views, wholesale flower trader Raju Shinde said that on Thursday, he had sold flowers worth over Rs 40,000. Last year, he had very poor sales. According to Tushar Sahane, a Nashik Road area resident, there was major crowding at the city markets and shoppers were finding it tough to even park their vehicles. “I will pray to Ganapati for the well-being of the people in these trying times,” added Sahane. Meanwhile, the NMC has announced that this year it will waive the taxes that it levies on Ganpati mandals for organising the festival. The mandals had been seeking the waiver as they too have been hit financially due to the pandemic. This year, the civic body has given permission to 128 mandals to organise the festival, although it had received 660 applications.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/people-told-to-maintain-safety-as-nashik-prepares-for-ganeshotsav/articleshow/86075101.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Oil cos to conduct awareness camps||Kolkata: The oil marketing companies (OMCs) will carry out awareness camps for both the dealers and motorists about effective handling of ethanol blending petrol (EBP). “We have already trained the dealers on how to handle the EBP without allowing water particles to invade the storage tanks. We will display the handling procedures at each of the retail outlets,” said an IOC spokesperson. Besides, OMCs will also undertake awareness camps for customers. At a tripartite meeting among the OMCs, petroleum dealers and the state government on Wednesday tried to find a solution to the contentious issue of accumulation of water in the storage tanks of the retail outlets and also in the fuel tanks of the vehicles. The meeting was presided over by the transport minister Firhad Hakim. Since the supply of the EBP is in line with the directive of the Government of India, OMC has nothing much to do about it. The EBP remained such a contentious issue that West Bengal Petroleum Dealers staged a no-sale-no-purchase day on August 31. “Like periodic cleaning of the storage tanks at retail outlets, the fuel tanks also need to be periodically cleaned for better engine efficiency and proper burning of the fuel,” said transport minister Firhad Hakim.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/oil-cos-to-conduct-awareness-camps/articleshow/86079900.cms||---

---||Dehradun||Felling of Sal trees: Doon residents seek NGT intervention||Dehradun: The residents of the Johari-Jakhan area, located in the middle of a reserved Sal tree forest, have been awaiting a response from the National Green Tribunal (NGT) for over two months now. In July this year, the locals had sent a letter to the green body and the chief minister highlighting the felling of Sal trees in their locality and had requested immediate action. The letter said that private contractors are felling Sal trees for carrying out construction activities under Khasra number 430, 433, 434 and 436 of the forest. The letter added that any private construction activity in the area is illegal as it is a forest and cannot be used for residential or commercial use without approval. Brig Anil Raghav, a resident of the area, told TOI, “The illegal felling of trees has been going on here for about 4-5 years now. After our repeated complaints, the forest department, in August 2020, sent officials to inspect the site. However, the menace of illegal felling of trees went on. Thus, we wrote to the CM and the NGT.” Another resident of the area, AC Buck, told TOI, “Taking cognisance of our repeated requests, the Mussoorie Dehradun Development Authority (MDDA) installed a board outside the colony which warned against illegal felling of trees but that too didn't stop errant contractors.” Families living in the area fear the repercussions of 'indiscriminate tree felling' and say that if more settlements come up in the forest area, criminal activities may increase in the otherwise peaceful locality. "We attached Google images of the concerned patch of land from 2010 and 2020 with the letter that we sent to the NGT and the CM. The images highlighted how illegal tree felling has led to the loss of green cover in the area," said Pramod Thareja, another resident of the area. When asked about the issue, divisional forest officer Kahkashan Naseem told TOI that her visit to the site revealed that 70 Sal trees were felled. “We marked around 200 trees in the area so that any further felling can be easily identified. The CJM court was also intimated of the matter, however, our appeal is pending,” added Naseem. Meanwhile, locals of the Rajwala area in Vikasnagar have also complained of illegal felling of trees. They too informed the NGT of the matter. Taking cognisance of the multiple complaints, the tribunal has issued a notice to the local administration for infringement of law.

Addressing reporters on Wednesday, IMA-Nashik chief Dr Hemant Sonasis said the next three months (beginning from September) will be crucial to ascertain whether there will be a third wave or not. “Usually, a new wave starts 100 days after the peak of the previous wave. In Nashik, the peak of the second wave was in May-June. Thereafter, the Covid curve started dipping. The medical fraternity in Nashik would appeal to all people to get vaccinated and strictly adhere to Covid-appropriate behaviour,” said Sonasis. Responding to the questions, Dr Sonasis said that the private hospitals in Nashik city are prepared to deal with the Covid cases during the third wave. These hospitals tackled over 70% of Nashik city’s total cases during the second wave of the pandemic. “Nashik IMA will be starting training sessions for nurses and other healthcare workers for treatment of children who get admitted in hospitals. Children need to be handled extremely carefully — especially while inoculating them, putting them on ventilator support etc. The training will start soon,” he added. According to him, the IMA has requested that some private hospitals in the city should be earmarked for exclusively treating Covid-affected children, so that the doctors, nurses, and healthcare workers can devote their full attention to the younger patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-ima-requests-all-to-get-vaccinated-as-soon-as-possible/articleshow/86075161.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Jalgaon airport sources said apart from the airport officials, the mock drill involved personnel from the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), local police, other agencies of the Union and state governments etc. At present, Jalgaon Airport, which is managed by the Airports Authority of India (AAI), operates flights connecting Mumbai and Ahmedabad. “The exercise was to check the efficacy of the contingency plan and the procedure to deal with any case of hijacking threat involving the airport. District collector Abhijit Raut reviewed the mock drill after it was carried out,” said airport officials. In this mock drill, a scenario was created where a pilot of an Aurangabad bound flight from Bhopal informed the Jalgaon airport control room that the plane was hijacked and it has been diverted to Jalgaon airport, where it would land. The airport authorities immediately swung into action informing the district disaster management authority, local administration, police and other important stakeholders in Jalgaon about the development. After the aircraft landed, it was taxied to the parking bay of the airport and commandos posing as staffers to provide food to passengers successfully overpower the hijackers and rescue the passengers. “Once the mock drill was over a debriefing session was held and the standard operating procedures were revalidated,” said an official of the airport.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/anti-hijack-mock-drill-held-at-jalgaon-airport/articleshow/86075131.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Madhuri Nalawade, CEO, Connecting NGO, said, “Many people have emailed to us instead of calling us due to lack of personal space as everyone was at home during the lockdown. More men have reached out to us than women regarding relationship issues and financial pressures.” The distress helpline responded to 2,427 calls and 717 emails from April 2020 to March 2021. Observing World Suicide Prevention Day on September 10, the NGO has put out an appeal for volunteers to join their various programmes. Arnavaz Damania, the NGO founder, said, “Kids are also facing stress, so we took our Peer Educator Programme online and reached out to 920 students, 178 parents and 120 teachers via orientations and sessions.” Poddar Foundation conducted a field session on mental health awareness for adolescent girls at Bhimnagar’s Mankhurd Aanganwadi in Mumbai. “The girls opened up after watching various slides and pictures which depicted what depression looks like, and many said that they felt it, but did not know it could be depression. It’s very important to talk about mental health issues without any stigma,” said Prakriti Poddar, managing trustee, Poddar Foundation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/calls-rise-to-suicide-prevention-helplines/articleshow/86079970.cms||Anjali Jhangiani
---||Allahabad||HC stays court order directing ASI survey of KVT-Gyanvapi complex||SLUG: COURT PROCEEDINGS STAYED Prayagraj: The Allahabad high court on Thursday stayed a Varanasi court’s order dated April 8, 2021, that directed the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to ‘conduct a comprehensive physical survey’ of the Kashi Vishwanath Temple (KVT)-Gyanvapi mosque complex and further proceedings of this case. Passing the directive, Justice Prakash Padia also granted three weeks’ time to the Central as well as the state government to file their respective replies in the matter. In its 26-page order, the court observed, “The judgment was reserved in all pending petitions by this court, after hearing the counsel for the parties at length on March 15, 2021. The court below has full knowledge to the fact that the judgement has already been reserved on March 15, 2021. In this view of the matter, the court below should not have proceeded and decided the application filed by the plaintiffs in the original suit for survey by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).” “In the opinion of the court, the court below should wait for the verdict in the petitions pending before this court and not proceed further in the matter till the time a judgement is delivered. The judicial courtesy and decorum warranted such discipline which was expected from the court below but for unfathomable reasons, neither of the courses were taken,” the court observed. “It is to be regretted that the court below departed from this traditional way in the present case and chose to examine the question himself. I have said so with the fond hope that judicial enthusiasm should not obliterate the profound responsibility that is expected from the court below,” the court further added. To recall, the civil judge (senior division), fast-track court (FTC) of Varanasi had directed the ASI on April 8, 2021, to conduct a survey of KVT-Gyanvapi mosque complex in order to find out whether a temple was demolished to build the mosque that stands there adjacent to KVT. In two separate petitions, UP Sunni Central Waqf Board and Anjuman Intezamia Masjid, Varanasi had challenged the said order of the Varanasi court. Earlier at one stage, while appearing for one of the petitioners, its counsel had contended that the suit on which the order of the civil judge (senior division), fast-track court (FTC) of Varanasi (dated April 8, 2021) is under challenge, is itself not maintainable under Section 4 of the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991, as it bars filing of suit or any other legal proceedings with respect to conversion of religious character of any place of worship, existing on August 15, 1947. Hence, no claim can be made regarding a religious place which existed on August 15, 1947. As per the Act of 1991, no relief can be sought for changing the status of any religious place as it existed on August 15, 1947, the petitioner’s counsel had contended and added, “hence the order for conducting the survey is illegal”. The petitioner’s counsel had also contended that when the high court had already reserved its judgment on the issue of maintainability of the aforesaid suit, the court below should not have passed any order in the suit till the issue of maintainability of the suit was decided by the high court. However, the counsel representing the temple had argued that there was no interim order of this court and only the judgement was reserved on March 15, 2021. Thus, there was no occasion for the court below to defer the hearing in the matter. After hearing all sides at length, the court had reserved its order on August 31, which was delivered today (September 9).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hc-stays-court-order-directing-asi-survey-of-kvt-gyanvapi-complex/articleshow/86082041.cms||---

He said the functioning of the planetarium could not resume this year too in view of Covid. Now, since all educational institutes have been opened in the offline mode and a majority of planetarium visitors are from the academic fraternity we have decided to open it. Srivastava said we will be running our shows titled ‘Cosmic journey’ which is of 45-minute duration. It will be ensured that Covid-19 safety norms are strictly followed during the shows.

The previous best figures for single-day vaccination was registered on September 4, when over 2.47 lakh beneficiaries were given shots across the five districts. Deputy director of the state health department, Nashik region, Dr PD Gandal told TOI that officials in Nashik, Jalgaon, Dhule, Nandurbar and Ahmednagar districts were able to administer such high number of beneficiaries since vaccines were adequately available. “The health workers in these districts are doing a stupendous job and should be applauded for their effort,” Gandal commented. Leading the five districts in the single-day vaccination numbers was Jalgaon, which for the second time since September 4, vaccinated over one lakh beneficiaries. On September 4 Jalgaon’s single-day vaccination figure stood at over one lakh and on Wednesday over 1.16 lakh beneficiaries were given the vaccine. Similarly, Ahmednagar, with over 88,000 vaccinations, and Nashik, with over 78,000 vaccinations, registered the highest number of vaccinations in their districts on Wednesday. Jalgaon district collector Abhijit Raut had recently said that the district is capable of carrying out 1.50 lakh vaccinations a day provided availability is not an issue. Health officials in these districts said they were able to carry out such high vaccination since they had received adequate doses. Vaccination coordinator and Nashik deputy collector Ganesh Misal said over 28.57 lakh beneficiaries in the district have been either partially or fully vaccinated so far. There are 405 government vaccination centres and 30 private hospitals involved in the vaccination programme in Nashik district. “The vaccine supply has improved and hence the single day vaccination in the district is constantly swelling,” added Misal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/over-3l-got-jabs-in-a-day-in-north-maha/articleshow/86075197.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

The green tribunal has instructed the PWD to pay the fine within a month at the divisional forest office. The road construction project had received a go-ahead in 2010 itself and the road cutting work was also started. However, the project came under the lens after locals expressed their dissatisfaction with the road alignment. Thereafter, a local, Ajay Bisht, approached the NGT in the matter. After almost 10 years, the NGT has, in its judgement, said that construction of the road is in the public interest and the PWD can go ahead with it. However, the green body asked the PWD to comply with environmental regulations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ngt-imposes-rs-2-lakh-fine-on-almora-pwd/articleshow/86077449.cms||---
---||Nashik||State govt to help Nizam-era schools||Aurangabad: Around 718 state-run Nizam-era schools in different parts of Marathwada are expected to undergo a makeover, while another 1,050 such institutions will be repaired soon. In a special initiative, the state government will provide funds worth Rs200 crore for construction of as many as 1,623 classrooms and necessary repairs. The list includes 81 schools from Aurangabad district. In total, 173 classrooms will be reconstructed and 130 schools that will undergo repair. Making a formal announcement to this effect, school education minister Varsha Gaikwad on Thursday said having basic infrastructure in place was a sign of any good school and the state government was committed for the same. In a series of tweets, Gaikwad said the initiative of reconstructing and repairing old schools, which will be scaled up in other parts of the state later, was part of the special educational quality development mission initiated by the government in the name of Rajmata Jijau. As part of the mission, the state government has been shelling out Rs 200 crore towards its 80% share of total expenditure, while the rest 10% each must be borne by respective Zilla Parishad (ZP) and concerned school. The schools to undergo a makeover have been identified based on a preliminary structural audit carried out by the Maharashtra Primary Education Council recently. “Schools having at least 60 to 100 students and with the ability to arrange 10% funding will be covered on priority under the initiative,” EM Kazi, joint secretary, school education department, stated in the latest government resolution. Aurangabad district secretary of ZP Teachers Association Kailas Gaikwad welcomed the initiative. “The planned measures will ensure safety of students and make schools more attractive. Many rural students still study in old ZP-run schools and they will benefit from the initiative,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/state-govt-to-help-nizam-era-schools/articleshow/86075214.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Nashik||Marathwada set to have one of the wettest years||Aurangabad: Marathwada may end up receiving the highest quantum of rainfall — during the stipulated four months of the rainy season — in recent times this year. Eight districts of the region have already received 798mm average rainfall since June 1, which is 142% of the expected normal rainfall. With three-and-a-half months still to go, in the June-December rainy season, the region has already surpassed its quota of 772mm rainfall. As per the official figures, the monsoon in 2005 had produced an average of 836mm rainfall in Marathwada, which is considered one of the wettest rainy seasons. The previous years producing heavy rainfall include 2006 (769mm), 2020 (725mm) and 2007 (703mm) among others. The ongoing good run of the monsoon, considered together with the rainfall of last year shows that the quantum showers received in Marathwada, known as the drought-prone region, differs from the observations made by India Meteorological Department (IMD). In January 2020, IMD reported the observed rainfall variability and trends in Maharashtra as an impact of climate change based on 30 years of the data (1981 - 2018) had stated that Marathwada receives the lowest average rainfall (454-600mm) during monsoon season during the identified period. V B Asewar, the chief scientist at the Parbhani-based Vasantrao Naik Marathwada Agricultural University, on Thursday, said that the pattern of rainfall observed in the region during the ongoing monsoon implies obvious signs of climate change. “Parts of Marathwada, including some areas of Aurangabad, Parbhani and Nanded districts, have received heavy over a period of few hours. Such excess showers, within a short span, and on such a large scale were not observed in Marathwada in the past,” he said. Wet years producing excess showers inflict damage more or less similar to years. “Kharif season remains at peril in case of heavy showers, which has a cascading effect on the rabi crops too. Our country, having an agrarian economy, cannot afford either wet or drought years. These are manifestations of climate change,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/marathwada-set-to-have-one-of-the-wettest-years/articleshow/86075271.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Lucknow||Lethal D2 strain behind west UP deaths: ICMR||Lucknow: The virulent D2 strain of the dengue virus – known to cause fatal haemorrhage – has been the killer of elders and children in districts of western Uttar Pradesh, said Dr Balram Bhargava, Director-General, Indian Council of Medical Research on Thursday. Experts informed TOI that D2 strain of the dengue virus (serotype 2 or DENV-2) is known to be the most virulent strain and can cause severity in disease. Taking a question on the issue at the health briefing in New Delhi, Dr Bhargava said: “The D2 variant of dengue was behind the surge in fever cases and deaths in western UP districts of Firozabad, Agra, Mathura and Aligarh.” He added that the D2 strain was not only virulent but also fatal. At least 58 lives have been lost in Firozabad alone due to dengue in the past three weeks according to official data. Alarmed over the situation, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath sent high-level teams to the affected districts toinitiate control measures. Alongside, a team from ICMR and National Centre for Disease Control also visited the district to isolate the pathogen behind the fever cases and deaths. Earlier, member, NITI Aayog (health), Dr VK Paul had admitted that outbreaks of mosquito borne diseases had been reported in several parts of the country and it was important to stay alert against them Health sources also revealed that several cases of scrub typhus and leptospirosis were also reported. Mosquito surveillance reports showed that the administration failed to check the growth of mosquitoes in the region. Vector surveillance is based on several indices of which house and contain indices are popular ones. In the house indices, prevalence of mosquito larva or pupae in households is assessed, while in the container indices, percentage of water holding containers infested with large or pupae is tracked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lethal-d2-strain-behind-west-up-deaths-icmr/articleshow/86082132.cms||Shailvee Sharda

During festivals like Diwali and Dasara, people tend to buy new vehicles and unlike last year, we hope to see far better registrations of all vehicles this time around. Electric vehicle is a segment which has increased its market share and presence in the city. We are sure that their sales and registrations will go up,” an official from the Pune RTO said. Another RTO official said high fuel prices was among the reasons for the growth in e-vehicle sales. “E-vehicles seem costly but a customer also calculates the money spent on fuel. An electric two-wheeler with a 250watt power motor or less doesn’t require an RTO registration, which is attracting people. The cost of such vehicles is around Rs 80,000 to Rs 90,000, but it can be recovered quickly. The sale of e-carts meant for transport of goods is high in Pune,” he said. Amey Pawar, an e-vehicle dealer in the city, told TOI that e-vehicles were doing very well. “There is a big growth and parents wanting bikes for their children, senior citizens and woman are opting for e-vehicles. The queries have gone up to 15 each day and the conversion rate is also decent,” Pawar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/e-vehicle-registrations-soar-in-july-all-eyes-on-festivals/articleshow/86080028.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Mumbai||BMC clears plan to revamp five footpaths for Rs 69 crore||MUMBAI: BMC has cleared a proposal to revamp five footpaths for Rs 69 crore, which means it will spend over Rs 10 crore for each one. The civic standing committee cleared a proposal to beautify and strengthen footpaths at Wadala, Chembur, Bandra and Goregaon. BMC will beautify and revamp footpaths at Lady Jehangir Marg, from St Joseph’s Circle, near Wadala station, to Ruia College; Maharshi Dayanand Saraswati Marg, from Diamond Garden to Chembur railway station; Sant Gyaneshwar Mandir Road and RKP Road in Bandra (E); and MG Road at Goregaon. TimesViewSpending Rs 69 crore for just five footpaths is truly exorbitant, particularly so because the quality of footpaths provided across the city is hardly world-class. The BMC must spend funds judiciously and in the city's best interests. Footpaths must indeed be provided, but quality ones and at a reasonable cost.After a pilot project of revamped footpaths was carried out at Fort, environment minister Aaditya Thackeray directed BMC to revamp other footpaths. Officials said they would focus on improving the surface for smooth mobility. “It will be a pilot project of sorts. We can take up more footpaths based on how these five footpaths turn out, and feedback from pedestrians,” the official said. A footpath policy was framed in 2018 to make them pedestrian-friendly. The civic body intended to replace paver blocks with concrete, as it is more long-lasting and cannot be dislodged easily. But there is no mention of BMC’s ‘Pedestrian First’ policy now. Officials said the revamp includes standardisation of footpaths, billboards, bus-stops, tree basins and hawking pitches. We will concretise footpath surfaces, make disabled-friendly ramps, widen tree basins and install concrete benches. There will also be billboard standardisation,” said an official. As part of a footpath upgrade at Fort, a prototype transparent bus shelter was installed. Officials said it was a standard shelter across international cities like New York, London and Singapore. Officials said after BEST and Mumbai Heritage Conservation Committee (MHCC) approval, other bus shelters will also be replaced. Samajwadi Party MLA and corporator Rais Shaikh said BMC was going ahead with projects without any priority list. “BMC must think at a time when its finances are in doldrums, it must halt such projects. BMC must first see the fate of the much-hyped projects like Tansa pipeline cycle track, which has failed. It has put on hold road work of Rs 1,200 crore and school upgradation projects worth Rs 150 crore due to lack of funds and now wants to make these fanciful footpaths,” Shaikh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bmc-clears-plan-to-revamp-five-footpaths-for-rs-69-crore/articleshow/86082282.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Police have recovered booty worth Rs33.4 lakh from the trio. Senior inspector Shankar Khatke from the Warje Malwadi police told TOI on Thursday, “The priest, Padmakar Joshi (46), would look for locked flats whenever he was visiting housing societies to perform pooja rituals and would later commit burglaries there. The women, Neelima Joshi (44) and Archana Khade (40), would accompany him to ensure easy access to societies and avoid suspicion.” The officer said, “Their involvement came to light when they were caught on a CCTV camera after an incident, related to stealing cash and ornaments collectively valued at Rs13 lakh, was reported in a housing society in Warje recently.” “We checked footages at various places and identified the routes used by the priest and his accomplices. We arrested them on September 4. During questioning, the suspects confessed their involvement in five burglaries,” he added. The police said thay have been arrested under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/trio-held-for-five-burglaries-booty-worth-rs-33l-seized/articleshow/86080005.cms||---
---||Delhi||Personal appearance for registration of marriage includes online mode: HC||New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Thursday said videoconferencing appearance fulfils the requirement of personal appearance before the authority concerned for registration of marriage. Justice Rekha Palli, who was hearing a plea by a US-based couple seeking registration of their marriage through videoconferencing, stated that the high court had permitted registration of a marriage through virtual mode earlier as well — in 2007 when the use of videoconferencing was at a very nascent stage. “I find that.. (the requirement of) personal appearance would include appearance through videoconferencing,” asserted the judge who said she will “allow the petition” seeking permission for virtual appearance before the registering authority. The court said a detailed order will be passed in a couple of days. The couple claimed that their marriage was solemnised through Hindu rites and rituals before the registration of marriage was made compulsory in 2014 by the Supreme Court. Since the couple relocated abroad, they were unable to get their marriage registered under the Delhi (Compulsory Registration of Marriage) Order, 2014, it was stated.

Poonia was reacting to the reports saying due to the increase in the population of the minority community, the majority community was fleeing the area due to fear. “It is very disturbing to hear that 300 families have been forced to leave right under the nose of the government. The government has to take the cognisance of the events unfolding in Malpura that has a history of communal disturbance,” he said. He added that the majority community has been complaining about the changing demographics in the tehsil, but the way they pasted posters outside their houses is shameful for the ruling government. “Similar incident has been happening in Mewar region, dominated by the minority community. The manner in which government has ignored the incidents shows that they are promoting communal politics,” said Poonia,. The BJP has directed its MLAs to raise the failures of the state government in the assembly. At a party meeting held at the assembly, Poonia said the session is an opportunity to expose the lies of the government, its mismanagement during Covid, graft in procuring medicines and medical equipment and unfulfilled pol promises.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/poonia-accuses-govt-ofplaying-appeasement-politics-in-malpura/articleshow/86082123.cms||---
---||Lucknow||NIRF rankings: Mixed results for city||Lucknow: The declaration of the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) ranking brought mixed results for the city’s higher educational institutes on Thursday. An improvement in the ranking of Dr Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University (BBAU) brought cheers while Lucknow University’s disappointing debut together with Dr Ram Manohar Lohia National Law University (RMNLU) and Indian Institute of Management-Lucknow slipping from its previous high ranks disheartened students and teachers. Two private institutes, Jaipuria Institute of Management and Integral University, brought some consolation for the city. Dr Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University, which didn’t figure in the top 100 universities in NIRF ranking last year, managed 65th rank this year while LU figured in the rank band of 150 to 200. RMNLU, which was at eighth position in 2018, 14th position in 2019 and 11th last year, slipped to 15th rank, this year. The Integral University ranked 41 among pharmacy institutes and Jaipuria Institute of management ranked 68 in the top 100 management institutes of the country. “BBAU really worked hard on three things: public perception, teaching and learning, graduation outcomes and placements. The university switched to the use of modern teaching tools and technologies, focused on making the lectures two-way and more interactive and achieved a good pass percentage and placement record that helped in image building,” said BBAU spokesperson Rachna Gangwar. LU spokesperson Durgesh Srivastava said, “It was for the first time we had participated in the ranking and getting a place in 150-200 rank band is not that bad. The varsity is working hard in all directions and in coming years will figure at a good place in the NIRF ranking.” RMNLU vice-chancellor, Prof SK Bhatnagar said, “For moving up in the ranking ladder, the university will have to expand its consultancy services.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/nirf-rankings-mixed-results-for-city/articleshow/86082167.cms||Mohita Tewari

The rain fury has damaged buildings of six primary health care centres in Aurangabad district, besides causing harm to 20 barrages and other irrigation structures. The collective losses towards these damages is pegged at over Rs 4.4 crore. The rain has also inflicted harm to four public water supply schemes from Kannad taluka with overall damage running into Rs 17.5 lakh. The heavy downpour observed for two days from September 7 has caused damage to 242 structures owned by different Gram Panchayats, leading to damage of Rs 29 crore. “Aurangabad district has witnessed different damages to the tune of Rs 245 crore due to incessant showers observed in past couple of days. As per guidelines of NDRF, the district is entitled to get at least Rs 8.9 crore towards necessary compensation,” Aurangabad ZP CEO Nilesh Gatne said.

The Telangana excise enforcement SIT probe in 2017 couldn’t find any strong evidence against actor Ravi Teja then. Ravi Teja is the sixth Tollywood personality to be quizzed by the ED so far. Apart from the actor and his driver, ED also grilled Zeeshan Ali Khan who was earlier named in the drugs case. The SIT had identified Calvin Mascarenhas and Zeeshan Ali Khan as key drug suppliers to Tollywood.  It was the WhatsApp conversations, call data records and mobile phone book and confessions of Khan and Mascarenhas that led to the Tollywood stars. However, the SIT did not register any case against any Tollywood stars citing lack of evidence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ravi-teja-quizzed-by-ed-in-tollywood-drug-case/articleshow/86082178.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

---||Meerut||2 minor boys found dead in UP forest killed by debt-hit man for e-rick||Meerut: Two minor boys, whose blood-soaked bodies were found dumped in a forest in Uttar Pradesh with multiple cuts and bruises a fortnight ago, were allegedly killed by a debt-ridden labourer who posed as a passenger and stole the e-rickshaw they were driving. The crime had shocked the region and its “gruesome nature” had led police to initially rule out robbery as the motive. On Thursday, Mohd Zahid, 28, was arrested for the double murder. Police have also arrested Shaukeen Ahmad, a resident of Amroha, to whom Zahid had taken the e-rickshaw after allegedly committing the crime to repay his debt of Rs 50,000. The vehicle was recovered from Ahmad. The victims — Mohd Sadiq (14) and his friend Mohd Aman (13) — were both residents of Shahjahanpur town, 25 km from Meerut, and were found murdered in a lonely stretch of the forest in Fatehpur Narayan village on August 29, a day after their families had reported them missing. The two had been driving an e-rickshaw, which belonged to Sadiq's brother, as they often helped their families financially by doing odd jobs. The e-rickshaw as well as Sadiq’s phone had gone missing after the murders. According to circle officer (Kithore), Brajesh Singh, the investigation relied on CCTV footage to crack the case. “It seemed like a blind case as no enmity angle surfaced during the investigation. So we scanned CCTV footage from a crossing at Shahjahanpur town where the boys were last seen talking to a passenger. We saw a man with a sack boarding their rickshaw. We focused on the passenger and found that he had been loitering suspiciously in the area for a few hours before he went up to the boys,” Singh said. In between, the man had made some calls. So police traced all cellphones that were active at the crossing on the day of the crime and summoned their owners. “Appearance of one of the people who turned up at the police station matched the passenger we were looking for. Zahid was interrogated and broke down during questioning. He confessed that he was under a debt of Rs 50,000 and decided to steal the e-rickshaw to repay it,” said the CO. Police said Zahid was able to convince the boys that he was a farmer and was carrying a sack of manure to his farm. “Zahid boarded their rickshaw and once they were deep in the woods, he asked the elder boy, Sadiq, to stop the rickshaw and help him pick a water pump from his farm. He took him through the forest and strangled him and stabbed him multiple times with a knife at a secluded spot. Then he returned and asked Aman to accompany him as the motor pump was too heavy. He killed the other boy as well,” the CO said. Zahid has been booked under section 302 (murder), 394 (voluntarily causing hurt while committing robbery), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence) and 364 (kidnapping) of the Indian Penal Code. Ahmad has been booked under section 411 (dishonestly receiving stolen property), said police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/2-minor-boys-found-dead-in-up-forest-killed-by-debt-hit-man-for-e-rick/articleshow/86077607.cms||Sandeep Rai

This is the second year in a row that NU did not figure in this elite list where Pune is ranked 20 while Mumbai at 96. India’s seventh oldest university was ranked between 150 and 200 in the list of nationwide universities. Other Vidarbha universities, including Amravati and Gondwana, too couldn’t find a place in the prestigious rankings released by the Union ministry of education. Some premier institutions like Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology (VNIT) and Indian Institute of Management (IIM) saved the region from embarrassment. While VNIT is ranked 54 in overall list, it was at 30 among top engineering colleges in the country. Last year, VNIT wasn’t included in the overall list and was at the 27th position among engineering colleges. IIM-N is ranked no. 40 among top management colleges in just the sixth year of its operations, thus maintaining last year’s position. Datta Meghe Institute of Medical Sciences (DMIMS) also figured in the list of overall institutions where it is at 100th position, three places below last year’s ranking. Among universities, it is placed at 64th position and among medical colleges, it is ranked 32nd. The Sawangi (Wardha) based deemed to be university’s dental college is ranked 19th in the dental list. Two state-run colleges also brought laurels for the city by finding their names in the list. Government Institute of Science, which recently got autonomy, is ranked 61st and Government Institute of Forensic Science, operating from the same premises, is at 88th position. City’s three more private colleges also found their names in the elite list of top institutions from the country in the engineering category. They included Ramdeobaba College of Engineering and Management at 119th, Yashwantrao Chavan College of Engineering at 149th and GH Raisoni College of Engineering at 130th. In some solace for NU, its Laxminarayan Institute of Technology is ranked 136 in the engineering list, and its department of pharmacy is between 76 and 100 in the pharmacy colleges’ list.

IIM-L under chairmanship of N Chandrasekaran, chairman of Tata Sons, fared badly on research and professional practice by scoring merely 41 out of 100. Its highest score of 94.8 has come in the graduation outcome parameter. “The rank speaks about deteriorating standards at IIML, one of the oldest management institute across the country. The institute doesn’t have a 10-year vision document after the one formed in 2011 expired this year,” said a former member of board of governors. An IIM-L faculty on condition of anonymity said, “With lack of initiatives, the academic rigour has diluted. It took 40 years to build IIM-L’s stature, but it now seems to be sinking.” Chairperson, corporate communications and media relations, IIM-L, Prof Nandita Roy said, “The institute is currently looking at the NIRF 2021 data. We will comment once we have analysed all parameters.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/iim-l-exits-top-5-league-of-b-schools-for-first-time/articleshow/86082203.cms||Isha Jain

After the auction was called off last year owing to the pandemic and spurt in Covid-19 cases, enthusiasm is back among the devout over this year’s auction. The 21-kg laddu fetched a record Rs 17.60 lakh in 2019. The bidder was Kolan Ram Reddy, a local Balapur resident. Till 2001, the laddu was fetching Rs 85,000. The journey of auctioning of Balapur laddu began in 1994. Kolan Mohan Reddy won the auction for Rs 450 in 1994. Mohan Reddy went onto win the auction for five years in a row. The extended family of Ram Reddy is now participating in the Balapur laddu auctions. Apart from locals, people from as far as Nellore in AP participate in the bidding.

Indian Institute of Technology-Kanpur (IIT-K) and Banaras Hindu University (BHU) brought laurels to the state by clinching 5th and 10th ranks respectively in the overall category. Last year, IIT-K was on 6th rank. “It is a matter of great pride and happiness that BHU has again secured third spot in the NIRF ranking in university category. I congratulate everyone in university,” said acting vice-chancellor Prof VK Shukla. “The university is taking a slew of measures to boost good quality teaching-learning, research and innovation,” he added. Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) improved its ranking significantly, jumping from 31st last year to rank 18 this time. Its score improved by five points — from 52.5 in 2020 to 57.4 in 2021. Indian Institute of Technology-BHU slipped two ranks to 28th, while King George’s Medical University went down to 60th place, from 50th in 2020.

The ranking was done in 10 categories — overall, universities, engineering, management, pharmacy, law, dental, architecture, medical and college. Ranking parameters included teaching, learning and resources, faculty-student ratio, permanent faculty, financial resources and their utilization, research, patents, publications and number of graduating and PhD students. Other factors such as outreach and inclusivity — percentage of students from other states/ countries and economically/ socially challenged students — besides peer perception, were also considered. In university category, seven institutions in UP made it to top 100, with BHU bagging the third spot. In engineering, IIT-Kanpur and IIT-BHU clinched 4th and 14th positions respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/iit-k-bhu-in-top-10-slot-amu-jumps-to-better-rank/articleshow/86082237.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Bhopal: Ganesh Chaturthi today, rain fails to dampen spirit at pandals||BHOPAL: Overnight rains on Wednesday which continued till Thursday afternoon once threatened to dampen the Ganesh festival spirit, but then the rains stopped and soon pandals could be seen coming up at different places in the city. But, it’s clear the festival would be a serene affair this time round with festivities mainly revolving around “shringar, darshan and puja” of Lord Ganesh. The city, which has more than 600 Ganesh idols installed at public places, may see a decline in numbers with people preferring to install Lord Ganesh in their households, a tradition gaining ground over the years. Last year, public celebrations of the Ganesh festival had not been allowed and it had further given a boost to installation of Lord Ganesh in households. There has also been a major boost to making clay Ganesh idols and POP idols, though cheaper, are definitely on their way out. The pandals are smaller with the district administration restricting their maximum size to 30x45 feet, they are open so as to allow devotees to have a darshan of the Lord easily and though the district administration had not put any ceiling on the height of the idol of Lord Ganesh and had only advised the organisers to keep the idols small, in most of the pandals organisers are sticking to the advice and keeping the size of idol less than six feet. The state government has also declared a local holiday on September 10 (Friday) on the occasion of Ganesh Chaturthi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/ganesh-chaturthi-today-rain-fails-to-dampen-spirit-at-pandals/articleshow/86080160.cms||Ashutosh Shukla

Only seven engineering institutions from Telangana figured in the top 200 compared to 11 in last year’s rankings. The figure stood at 16 in 2019. In a first, the Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad (IIT-H) secured 15th rank in the research category, while improving its overall ranking to 16th from last year’s 17th rank. In the engineering category, the IIT-H retained it’s eighth position for the third consecutive year. “IIT-H is the only second-generation IIT that consistently made into the top 10 engineering institutes in the country. IITH’s score on some parameters such as faculty-student ratio, faculty qualification, financial resource utilization, patents, and footprint of projects, are comparable or higher than some of the older generation IITs,” said Prof Vinod Janardhan, convenor, NIRF, IIT-H. The University of Hyderabad (UoH) ranked 25th in the research category. However, in the overall rankings, the university slipped from 15th to 17th rank this year. In the university’s category, the varsity, which was granted the Institution of Eminence tag two years back by the ministry of education, has slipped from the sixth to ninth rank. “We need a gap analysis to understand our downward slide, even if this was in an academic year affected by the pandemic. The UoH will ensure that it is recognized as a top institution not only in India but also international. For this we will have to create higher benchmarks for promotions, recruitment and incentives so that the quality of research and teaching improve rapidly,” said Prof BJ Rao, UoH vice-chancellor. Other institutions such as the Osmania University (OU), Jawaharlal Nehru Technology University (JNTU) Hyderabad, National Institute of Technology (NIT) Warangal and International Institute of Information Technology (IIIT), Hyderabad too performed poorly this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/telangana-institutes-slide-further-in-nirf-rankings/articleshow/86081596.cms||Preeti Biswas

---||Hyderabad||Utsav panel to await govt decision on Khairatabad Ganesh idol immersion||Hyderabad: The high court order on Thursday banning immersion of Plaster of Paris idols in Hussain Sagar and other lakes put a question mark on the ‘nimmajan’ (immersion) of Khairatabad Ganesh. While welcoming the HC order, the Khairatabad Ganesh Utsav Committee said it would wait for the government’s final decision. The committee, however, said it was a decades old tradition of immersing the tallest Ganesh idol in the Hussain Sagar (NTR Marg side), which had been followed for over 50 years now. “We have already built a 40-ft high ‘Pancha Mukha Rudra Maha Ganapathi’ with PoP and used water colours before the HC issued the interim orders,” S Sudarshan, founder-cum-organiser of Ganesh Utsav Committee, told TOI. He further said: “If the authorities do not allow the Khairatabad Ganesh idol for immersion in Hussain Sagar, we will have no option but to keep the idol in the same pandal and offer poojas till the government arrives with a final decision.” Sudarshan said arrangements like carrying the gigantic idol to NTR Marg on a truck trolley and talking to irrigation, R&B departments, GHMC and police to arrange huge cranes to lift the idol and immerse in the Hussain Sagar water at the designated area had been completed. BOX Around 2,000 policemen have been deployed for the peaceful procession of immersion of Khairatabad Ganesh idol, which starts from the Ganesh pandal to NTR Marg, covering a distance of 1.5 km. Police installed CCTVs all along the immersion route as thousands of devotees line up to witness the Khairatabad Ganesh idol. “We have received a route map from cops. We hired a special trolley, which has been deployed for more than three decades, to pull the heavy weight Ganesh idol. Welding works to carry the idol without any hurdles will be executed a day before the immersion,” a member of the utsav committee said. The irrigation department supervises the mechanical works of the trolley. BOX The Khairatabad Ganesh idol immersion procession is called ‘Shobha Yatra’. As hundreds and thousands of devotees raise slogans of ‘Ganapathi Bappa Moriya’, the procession starts after the priests offer special puja at the pandal. Some processionists dance while others beat the drums. Previously, the Shobha Yatra used to take 12-14 hours, but now cops restrict it to three to five hours.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/utsav-panel-to-await-govt-decision-on-khairatabad-ganesh-idol-immersion/articleshow/86080938.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Cops left with little time to re-route Ganesh idol immersions||HYDERABAD: The high court ban on immersion of Ganesh idols made of plaster of paris (PoP) in Hussainsagar or any other lake in the city has left cops with little time to figure out a way to implement the order. Caught by surprise a day before the festival, cops are now waiting for government orders to make the next move. The biggest headache for cops being the giant idol at Khairatabad which is made of PoP and takes hours to reach Hussainsagar, which is barely 2 kms away. “The number of idols this year is likely to be 10% less than 2019. But most idols immersed in Hussainsagar are made of PoP and many people have already purchased them. We have to now find a plan for the Khairatabad Ganesh and many other big PoP idols immersed in Hussainsagar each year,” a senior cop said. Last year due to pandemic curbs there was no Ganesh procession. While in 2019, about 45,000 Ganesh idols were immersed in Hussainsagar and another 10,000-12,000 idols in water bodies of Rachakonda and Cyberabad commissionerate. In 2019, 29 cranes were put up on Tank Bund and six on NTR Marg. This year, after Tank Bund beautification, only 16 cranes were planned there while the rest were to be set up at People’s Plaza and NTR Marg. But the Tank Bund is now out of bounds after court order. While there are baby ponds in Cyberabad and Rachakonda, they have not been tested for immersing several idols.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cops-left-with-little-time-to-re-route-immersions/articleshow/86080740.cms||---

These drone flights were conducted in the visual line of sight (VLOS) range, which is 500 to 700 meters from the base and visible to the drone pilot. A senior government official pointed out that Thursday’s trial run was to test the drones and carry out a general recce of the surroundings. Prem Kumar Vislawath, founder & CEO of Marut Drones, pointed out that its Hepicopter Consortium will start actual deliveries of medical supplies, including Covid-19 vaccines, from September 11. “Each Hepicopter drone has the capability to carry a payload of 15 kg over a 20-km range. The drone will be paired to a custom developed modular temperature-controlled box platform that can safely deliver multiple payloads simultaneously. This will improve access to vaccines, samples and possibly on-demand medical products to PHCs and subcenters in remote areas,” Vislawath. Skye Air Mobility co-founder Swapnik Jakkampudi pointed out that on Thursday the startup conducted six drone flights, of which only two had payloads. “These flights were meant for preparations and to see if all the systems are in place,” he added. On September 11, Telangana will become the first state in India to fly drones at BVLOS for delivery of medical supplies as part of its ‘Medicine From the Sky Project’. The event will be attended by Union civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia and Telangana industries minister KT Rama Rao, among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/vlos-medical-supply-drones-tested-ahead-of-d-day-on-sept-11/articleshow/86081725.cms||---

While the case positivity rate continues to be about 2%, there are worries that cases might go up after the festive season even as the state has issued Ganesh Chaturthi guidelines. Dr Anil Mehndiratta, a chest specialist, said that there is no scope for lowering guard because even now critical cases are being reported. “People should continue to take care and those who are yet to get vaccinated, should not delay further. I know, several people have refrained from getting vaccinated,” he said. On Thursday, as many as 18 patients were hospitalised and six discharged. Dr Shailesh Hede said that for Ganesh Chaturthi people travel to their ancestral homes, either within or outside the state. Also, as a practice, groups go house-to-house to view the Ganesh idols and decor, and participate in aartis. “There will be a tremendous increase in human interaction having the potential to serve as a fertile ground for the resurgence of Covid. A good percentage of the population has been vaccinated, but a significant number have not taken the vaccine for reasons best known to them,” Hede said. Even though this is the festive time, and the second year in a row that people have been advised to celebrate the festival by complying with Covid-appropriate behaviour, he said, this is certainly not the time to let one’s guard down. If you must celebrate, the mantra should be “celebrate responsibly”. Mehndiratta said even people who are vaccinated should not take things lightly and continue to take precautions. Hede said children are without any armour of protection. Their parents must take due care. “Parents must impress upon their children to take care. While elderly and infirm will continue to be vulnerable, vaccination will help prevent complications in case of an infection,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/continue-to-exercise-caution-dont-let-guard-down-say-docs/articleshow/86077624.cms||---

In its 67th year now, the iconic Khairatabad Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations have come a long way since. “Inspired by Bal Gangadhar Tilak’s plea to celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi as a mark to unify people, my brother S Shankaraiah started with a one-foot idol at Khairatabad. We have been continuing his legacy ever since,” said S Sudarshan, founder-cum-organiser of Khairatabad Ganesh Utsav Committee. Since then, the idol has been growing in size each year. From a mammoth 65ft in 2019, the idol this year has been kept at 40ft due to major challenges every year en route the immersion in Hussainsagar. Last year, due to pandemic restrictions it was reduced to 9ft. “Across the city, there are hundreds of pandals with unique idols, but it is the massive Khairatabad pandal which is visited the most,” said Sudarshan. This year, over 100 skilled artisans from the two Telugu states, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu toiled for four months to build the ‘Pancha Mukha Rudra Maha Ganapati’ with plaster of Paris (PoP). A special pooja will be performed, seeking riddance from third wave of Covid-19. Every year, the committee selects a different theme for the idol. While organisers built it with clay for a long time, Sudharshan said they switched to PoP due to the finishing it provided. “Though it is expensive to build a PoP idol, we have not compromised. Every year we spend Rs 60-75 lakh. Advertisements, donations and hundi collections are our revenue sources,” a committee member said. Anticipating nearly eight lakh devotees during celebrations from September 10 to September19, police have made elaborate arrangements and deployed around 200 personnel. Even the rail track near the pandal will be monitored to regulate devotees’ movements.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/khairatabad-ganesh-growing-in-stature-every-yr-since-1954/articleshow/86080903.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||India||1500-year-old temple remains found in UP||AGRA: The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has found during routine scrubbing the remains of an ancient temple that dates back to the 5th century CE, the Gupta period, at Bilsarh village in UP’s Etah. The staircase, excavated last month, has Shankhalipi inscriptions that the ASI has now confirmed say ‘Sri Mahendraditya’, the title of the Gupta ruler Kumaragupta I who ruled over what is now north-central India for 40 years in the 5th century CE. Bilsarh has been protected since 1928 and was known as an important Gupta period site. “There were two decorative pillars (at the spot) close to one another, with human figurines (found earlier). To understand their significance, we conducted further excavation and found the stairs,” said Vasant Swarnkar, superintending archaeologist of ASI’s Agra circle. “We found something written on it in Shankhalipi. It was deciphered as saying ‘Sri Mahendraditya’, which was the title of Kumaragupta I of the Gupta dynasty.” Shankhalipi is an ornate, stylised, ancient script, used between the 4th and 8th centuries CE for names and signatures. A pillar from the pastThe discovery came about during a “routine” clean-up. Around every monsoon, the ASI starts scrubbing its protected sites. There’s a lot of overgrowth to get rid of. This time, Swarnkar said, he was monitoring the cleaning when he thought the spot should be excavated and the ASI stumbled upon ancient stairs leading to a temple. The inscription found on the Etah remains had earlier been seen on a horse statue found in Lakhimpur Kheri. It is now at the State Museum, Lucknow. But that was not confirmation enough. So, Swarnkar sent images of the inscriptions to noted epigraphist Dr Devendra Handa. At the same time, ASI officials visited Lucknow to go over the horse statue inscription again. Both confirmed it was indeed Shankhalipi. Because the inscription names Kumaragupta I, the remains were dated back to his reign. The Etah remains are only the third structural temple of the Gupta period found so far. “The Guptas were the first to build structural temples for Brahminical, Buddhist and Jain followers. Prior to that, only rock-cut temples were built,” said Prof Manvendra Pundhir from the Aligarh Muslim University’s history department. “Before this, only two structural temples were found — Dashavatara Temple in Deogarh and Bhitargaon Temple in Kanpur Dehat. The Etah pillars are well-sculpted, better than the earlier examples in which only the lower sections were carved. The decorative pillars and staircase are a bit more advanced than the earlier ones.” The ASI will now conserve the remains, put up a shed and a descriptive signboard for visitors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/1500-year-old-temple-remains-found-in-up/articleshow/86084469.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

Though Nimisha Bijo, against whom a case has been registered for allegedly breaking temple customs, removed the photographs from her Instagram account, she has been receiving abusive phone calls and threats on social media. Speaking to TOI on Wednesday, Nimisha, a Mundakkayam native living in Ernakulam, said she will be appearing before Thiruvalla police on Thursday. The model will also file a complaint with the cyber wing of the police over the social media abuse she has been facing. “No woman should face such a situation. I made a mistake out of ignorance. Nobody warned me. When I realised my mistake I removed the photographs from Instagram. They should have at least considered that I am a woman,” she said. Only after a controversy erupted over her photo shoot did she come to know about the relevance of Palliyodam from Google, she said. Palliyodam is a type of large snakeboat used for boat race associated with Aranmula temple. Various villages near the temple own such boats, which are mostly used for the famous Aranmula Vallasadya and the boat race. Nimisha, who has acted in a few TV serials, had worn her shoes while posing on the boat. According to the Seva Sangham, she broke two rules: First, women are not allowed on the boats and second, nobody steps on the boat wearing footwear. “I am a model and I will have to pose differently for photographs. To some of the photos people have commented that boiling water should be poured over me,” said Nimisha, who is also a purple belt in Karate. “People have been abusing me without knowing the truth,” she added. Though she has removed the photos from her Instagram account, the photos are still in circulation on social media platforms. “We want to ensure that the photos are not circulated further, bringing dishonour to the Palliyodam. We may approach the court,” said an official with Palliyodam committee. He said the committee will hold a meeting on Thursday. Thrivalla police registered a case against the model based on a complaint by Palliyodam committee. Section 153 (wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot) of the IPC had been imposed against her.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/getting-abusive-phone-calls-and-threats-says-model/articleshow/86050019.cms||Jaikrishnan Nair
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: SP & BSP kept mum when Muslims shot during CAA protest, says Asaduddin Owaisi||LUCKNOW: Launching a scathing attack on the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) for exploiting Muslims as a vote bank, All India Ittehadul Muslameen national president Asaduddin Owaisi on Thursday said 22 Muslims were shot dead in UP in Citizens’ Amendment Act (CAA) protests, but neither of the two parties questioned the government about the death of the innocent Muslims even once. “During the CAA protests 22 Muslims suffered gunshot wounds in their head and chest and not in the leg. I am not saying this on my own. A report by retired judges of the Supreme Court Sudarshan Reddy and the Delhi High Court AP Shah states that Muslims were shot at,” Owaisi said addressing a public meeting in Barabanki. On a three-day visit to UP, the Hyderabad MP had addressed a public meeting in Ayodhya on Tuesday followed by one in Sultanpur. “Main apko ye batane aaya hoon ki kya jab is tarah ka koi zulm hota hai to kya koi secular … jo apne aap ko secular party kehti hain … ye zulm is liye ho raha hai ki Modi wazir-e-azam hain … ye nau nihal secular party koi awaz nahi uthati … (I have come to tell you that when such atrocities happen then any of the secular … those who call themselves secular parties …. These atrocities are happening because Modi is the prime minister … these secular parties don’t raise their voice). Owaisi went on to allege that such incidents are continuing unabated as those unleashing these atrocities know that Modi and BJP is with them and that they will go scot free. “But be it the SP, BSP or the Congress party, all of them keep mum when such incidents take place,” Owaisi said adding that all these parties maintained a studied silence when the CAA was passed in the parliament and did not utter a word on the triple talaq law despite knowing that it was against the spirit of the Constitution. “With attacks on Muslims and Dalits, the ruling BJP wants to send across a message that they are in power and can do whatever they want to and no one can stop them. This is why no strict action is ever initiated against those who execute such atrocities. If action is initiated after much hue and cry, then perpetrators of such crime are arrested as a formality and let off on bail within 24 hours.” Striking a local connection, Owaisi raised the issue of a mosque that was demolished by the district administration in Barabanki. “How can they demolish the mosque … it is not their ancestral property,” he questioned. The issue is pending before the High Court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/owaisi-sp-bsp-kept-mum-when-muslims-shot-during-caa-protest/articleshow/86082278.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

Patil was speaking at Ardal village in Ajara tehsil after dedicating Ambeohol medium irrigation project of 1.24 TMC capacity. The earthen dam was pending since last two decades mainly due to issues related to rehabilitation.

Its catchment area is 33.84 square kilometres and the command area is 3,925 hectares, which will come under direct irrigation. Mahesh Surve, superintendent engineer of Kolhapur Irrigation Circle, said Ambeohol dam will cater to the irrigation and drinking water requirements of 21 villages felt especially during summer season. Currently, Kolhapur district has four major, six medium and 58 minor irrigation projects with total capacity of 97 TMC. Patil said, “We have decided to speed up completion of the irrigation projects in the state. The remaining five projects (Dhamani, Naganwadi, Sarfnala, Uchangi and Sonurle) will be completed by June 2024. I hope farmers will benefit from Ambeohol project.” These dams (two medium and three minor) were proposed to arrest water as per the quota reserved by Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal. Rural development minister Hasan Mushrif said Patil’s initiative in resolving issues by holding meeting with all stakeholders helped complete the project. He said he would strive to complete rehabilitation of all project-affected people. So far, rehabilitation of 82% such people has been done.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/work-on-five-dams-in-kolhapur-to-be-done-by-2024-jayant-patil/articleshow/86075429.cms||---

The police initially faced resistance from the people, who refused to go to the counselling centres and instead said that they would pay the fine. The counselling experience was learning enough for many. “I will henceforth never leave my home without a helmet. It was very unpleasant experience as I had to spend four hours of the day listening to a lecture and then returning to the police station to get my bike,” said Rajesh Patil, who was asked to attend the counselling session. Police commissioner Deepak Pandey had ordered the campaign against all the motorists driving without helmet in the city. Police teams were deployed at various spots across the city. They caught people driving without helmets and directed a select number towards the counselling centre, while releasing a few with warning. “It was the first day today. The vehicles of 80 motorists not using helmets were seized. They were sent to the counselling centre,” a senior police officer from city traffic branch said. The police authorities pointed out that the action was not for collecting fine or penalizing people, but part of awareness drive about the safety of self and the pillion rider. The commissioner of police had said that even pillion riders were required to wear the helmets but did not face action on Thursday. All women riding alone without helmet, or riding pillion without helmet were left with a warning by the police.

The 2021 National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) placed them at the top of the college rankings. Among the city institutions, however, Hindu and St Stephen’s slid to the 8th and 9th positions, respectively, from the 3rd and 4th places they held last year. Among universities, Delhi University slipped one place to 12th this year, but Jamia Millia Islamia moved up to 6th from 10th while Jawaharlal Nehru University retained its second spot, after Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru. Explaining the slide, DU vice-chancellor PC Joshi surmised, “The one parameter in which we performed poorly is the teacher-student ratio. We are 30 marks behind JNU in this regard.” Joshi however, pointed out that in research, DU ranked 11 to JNU’s 18. There are 28 DU colleges among the Top 100 in the country, with Sri Venkateswara, Deen Dayal Upadhyaya and Kirori Mal improving their rankings. However, like Hindu, Hansraj and Acharya Narendra Dev College, despite being in the top 20, slid down the order.  Hindu principal Anju Srivastava said, “We have seen the results and are yet to analyse the reasons for our lower ranking. But I think that teacher-student ratio might be one of our drawbacks.” Jamia attributed its improved performance to the focus on research and faculty quality and vice-chancellor Najma Akhtar told TOI, “This achievement is due to the improved perception our teaching, placements research and other facilities.” Congratulating the staff and students of JNU, VC M. Jagadesh Kumar said, “We are happy that despite the globally debilitating Covid-19 pandemic, the JNU teachers and students did not flag in their effort and energy with research and teaching. We draw immense satisfaction from the innovative research and teaching programmes JNU has launched in the past five years.” In the category of engineering colleges, Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, has retained its second position.  Its director, V Ramgopal Rao, expressed happiness at the institute's management department featuring among the top five in the country in this category. “Happy to see IIT Delhi's management department figures among the top five management programmes in the country, alongside the IIMs. IIT Delhi's management department has the potential to soon become the 'D' among the ABCD of #management schools in India. We are working on it,” said Rao. As for state universities, Delhi Technological University has improved from its 45th place to 42nd this year, while Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University made a bigger leap from 95 to 79. In the ranking of institutions offering legal studies, National Law University, Jamia Millia Islamia and Indraprastha University were at the second, seventh and 12th spots, respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/miranda-house-lsr-stay-on-the-mark-in-ranking-of-best-colleges/articleshow/86080237.cms||Shradha Chettri

---||Dehradun||Char Dham stay: ‘Save our livelihoods’, tour ops, bizmen appeal to petitioners||Nainital: Tour operators, local businessmen and taxi drivers from Uttarkashi, Chamoli and Rudraprayag – the districts where the four Char Dham shrines are located — have appealed to the petitioners, who had filed pleas that led to the high court staying the yatra, to “save livelihoods and families of 25,000 people”. A delegation of the local businessmen met the petitioners on Thursday and sought their support in allowing the yatra in a phased manner. The petitioners— over half a dozen — had raised concerns over the state’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. While none of the pleas sought a stay or cancellation of the yatra —which was to start on July 1 — the court stayed the pilgrimage, citing concerns about the predicted third-wave of the pandemic. Abhishek Ahluwalia, part of the delegation which met the petitioners, told TOI that at least 25,000 people depend on the yatra for their survival. “There has been no income for a year and a half. The stay has hurt the economy and local businessmen and their families are struggling to survive,” he said. Another member of the delegation said the yatra generates nearly Rs 1,600 crore for the local economy and is the only source of income for people living in the vicinity of the shrines. “The portal of the shrines will close in a few weeks, but there is still a chance to make up for the losses. We have filed a representation before the government and before the HC to remove the stay,” he said. Advocate Shiv Bhatt, counsel for one of the petitioners, said the petitioners were “sympathetic to the needs of the local businessmen” and the court had been requested to hold a hearing on the matter. Bhatt added that he has met government officials including additional chief secretary (ACS) Anand Bardhan and asked them to allow the yatra while making vaccination certificates as well as RT-PCR report mandatory. “Pilgrims from states that have a high number of cases can be barred from coming,” said Bhatt. On Wednesday, the Uttarakhand government had approached the high court seeking vacation of stay on the yatra. The court, however, said it was unable to act as the matter was pending in the Supreme Court. After the high court stayed the yatra on June 28, the Uttarakhand government had moved the SC seeking a stay on the HC’s directions. According to Bhatt, the state government has now filed an application in the apex court, seeking withdrawal of the petition challenging the high court’s stay.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/char-dham-stay-save-our-livelihoods-tour-ops-bizmen-appeal-to-petitioners/articleshow/86072308.cms||Prashant Jha

Police have registered an FIR, but are waiting for the girl to record her statements under 164CrPC to arrest the two accused, who have been detained. Police have said the case was still “suspected” as the medical examination has not confirmed gang rape. Police are still pursuing the case seriously. “We are awaiting the 164 CrPC statement of the complainant and only after verifying other facts related to the case, the arrests would be made,” said SP Tejaswini Gautam. The complainant hails from Meerut and lives in Delhi. The SP visited the spot and was accompanied by DSP Amit Singh, who is also the investigating officer in this case. “We have lodged an FIR in this connection. There are many loopholes in the claims made by the woman.,” said an officer. Police have taken the call detail records of the woman, her relative and the two accused to know if they had prior acquaintance. “It has been found that the relative of the woman had made phone calls to the accused prior to the rape allegation. They had spat over money too. We have got some eyewitness of their verbal spat near the Silisher area,” said an officer. The woman changed her statements related to her address. “Initially she claimed to be a native of Delhi, then said she is from Noida and finally said she is a native of Meerut but lives in Delhi,” the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/police-lodge-fir-in-siliserh-rape-find-case-suspected/articleshow/86082339.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Compensate tree by tree: Uttarakhand high court to forest department||Nainital: The Uttarakhand high court has told the state forest department that it would like a "commitment” that the department would compensate “tree by tree” for over 1,600 Sal trees in Rajaji National Park which are to be felled for the Dehradun-Delhi expressway that aims to cut travel time between the two cities by half. The bench of Chief Justice R S Chauhan and justice Alok Kumar Verma was hearing public interest litigations (PILs) that have raised concerns over the environmental impact of the six-lane expressway on Rajaji. The expressway is expected to cut travel time between Delhi and Dehradun from five hours to two.  Environmentalists have raised concerns about a 19.7-km section between Ganeshpur (UP) and Dehradun that goes through forests. Most of it is in UP, except the 3.4-km stretch in the eco-sensitive zone and reserve forests of Shivalik hills. The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has informed the court that it is planning to build a major chunk of the road in Uttarakhand as elevated but it will still require felling some trees. On Wednesday, Abhijay Negi, counsel for one of the petitioners, said that even if the NHAI were to build an elevated road through a portion of the forest, it would still require felling of 1,622 Sal trees. The counsel added that the move will affect the ecology of the forest as Sal trees are very difficult to grow. The court has now directed the forest department to inform it of the number of Sal trees growing in Rajaji as well as details about re-planting, including where they would be planted and who will be responsible for ensuring their maintenance for ten years. The court has also asked the forest department to answer whether these trees could be easily grown or which species would beneficially replace them. The forest department has been directed to file its response by September 21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/compensate-tree-by-tree-hc-to-forest-dept-as-1-6k-trees-to-be-axed-for-del-doon-e-way/articleshow/86072330.cms||Prashant Jha

The CM also pitched for providing free treatment and medical kits to the needy. Yogi issued the directives after holding a review meeting through video conferencing with divisional commissioners, ADG Zone, DMs, SSPs, CMOs and other senior officials late Thursday. Reviewing the status of JE and AES cases in Kushinagar, Deoria, Basti, Siddharthnagar, Sant Kabir Nagar, Gorakhpur and Maharajganj, Yogi stressed on better surveillance, besides taking precautions. There has been no death due to JE and AES so far this year. Taking cognizance of complaints of harassment of patients by private hospitals in some districts, he directed respective DMs to take strict action. Reviewing district-wise progress of Covid vaccination, Yogi expressed satisfaction over the status of top three districts Gautam Budh Nagar, Ghaziabad and Baghpat, where most number of people aged 45 plus have been vaccinated. He gave instructions to expedite vaccination in Prayagraj, Sonbhadra, Firozabad and Ballia. Yogi said people from various districts come to meet him during Janata Darshanevery day. Most complaints are related to revenue department and police and hence all DMs, SSPs should meet public for an hour every day. “Officers posted in field should make police station day and tehsil day effective. Reviewing the complaints received on Jansunwai portal and Chief Minister’s Helpline in June, July and August, the CM expressed dissatisfaction over the situation in Chandauli, Gorakhpur, Ballia and Ghaziabad and directed the DMs to clear the pending cases of health, PWD and revenue department within a week. The CM also inquired about the actions taken by police chiefs in Gonda, Hamirpur, Hardoi, Sitapur vis-a-vis complainants and gave them a week’s time to improve their style of working. Yogi appreciated police in Firozabad, Etawah and Shahjahanpur for redressal of complaints and issued stern orders to police officials in Prayagraj, Sambhal, Mau and Shamli districts to expedite the disposal of grievances. “Women beat police officers should visit villages, establish dialogue with women and try to solve their problems,” said Yogi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/activate-command-centre-to-curb-dengue-malaria/articleshow/86082332.cms||---

Delhi recently battled a brutal second wave of Covid-19 that claimed a large number of lives, with the shortage of oxygen at hospitals across the city adding to the woes. On April 20, Delhi had reported 28,395 cases, the highest in the city since the beginning of the pandemic. On April 22, the case positivity rate was 36.2%, the highest so far.

A division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Kilor asked the retired judge to thoroughly investigate all PU lands, such as playgrounds, open spaces and gardens, which were encroached or leased out and later registered in the name of private parties. He was directed to complete the investigations within six months and submit a detailed report on violations, said petitioner’s counsel M Anil Kumar. The judges have fixed Rs50,000 as remuneration for the judge to start with. Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) officials were told to fully cooperate with the inquiry panel. Justice Haq was also told to inquire into the contention of petitioners — Jagjitsingh Saddal and others — that they were stopped from constructing anything on their plot as it was reserved for playground and primary school by the NIT. The petitioners claim NIT had auctioned a playground and open space reserved for the school at Indora in 1987, and NMC had allowed the plot buyers to construct homes there under the aegis of Indora Housing Society. After petitioners were barred from construction, they approached the judiciary doors in 2007. On Wednesday, the judges directed NMC chief and NIT chairman to personally look into the case and ensure that the entire record and proceedings of DP reservation of petitioner’s plots are submitted, and any failure would be viewed seriously. Quoting its order of July 7, 2018, the justices observed that since 1987, instead of curbing illegal layouts and developments, under the guise of policy decisions, layouts and encroachments are being legalized at the cost of the general public by the civic bodies. Box HC grants 6 weeks to CBI to probe Nimgade murder case The HC on Thursday granted six weeks to CBI to probe veteran architect Eknath Nimgade murder case and file a status report.

The case was booked under the IPC sections of cheating, forgery, criminal breach of trust, criminal conspiracy and Prevention of Corruption Act (PCA) against former member of eGovernance Authority S Vemuri Hari Krishna Prasad, Infrastructure Corporation of Andhra (INCAP) CMD K Sambasiva Rao, Tera Software Private Limited MD Tummala Gopichand, Himachal Futuristic Company Private Ltd and directors of these companies. CID in the FIR said chairman of APSFL submitted a report on the illegalities which took place in awarding the tender of AP FiberNet phase I. “Krishna Prasad, who was appointed as a member of the tender evaluation committee, colluded with Gopichand, officials of APSFL and then government. They ensured that the tender for Rs 321 crore was illegally awarded to Tera Software though it lacked the requisite qualifications,” the CID alleged. APSFL in its complaint alleged that Tera Sofware was blacklisted and hastily whitelisted only to allow it to participate in the bid. The CID said in the FIR that the last date of submission of the bid was extended with mala fide intention from July 31, 2015, to August 7, 2015. “This was done in order to facilitate Tera Software to form a consortium and to participate in the bid. The company did not even have the required consortium as on July 31 as mentioned in the initial tender document,” the CID alleged. Krishna Prasad, however, termed the allegations as ‘absolute lies’. He told TOI, “It is politically motivated. Let them prove the allegations. I have already filed a criminal defamation. As there has been no action for the past two years, I have approached the high court.” He said his statement will be recorded on September 16 as per the court order. “Due to this case, they may have hurriedly issued the FIR,” he alleged. INCAP took up the project of laying optical fiber over existing electrical towers and poles under phase I of the fiber grid project. The aim of the project was to provide optical fiber connectivity to villages/towns across the state. APSFL alleged Tera Sofware was blacklisted and hastily whitelisted only to allow it to participate in the bid.

From August 1 onwards the KTC fleet was plying from Goa to border areas like Belgavi, Karwar and Sawantwadi. “Currently many residents of Goa are coming home for Ganesh Chaturthi but even after the festival, the services will continue. The interstate operations will be regularized from now onwards,” KTC general manager Sanjay Ghate told TOI. Currently there is only one bus each operating from Goa to Mumbai, Goa to Pune, Goa to Bengaluru and Goa to Hyderabad. While most of the buses resumed operations from August 23, the Goa to Hyderabad service started on September 4. This interstate bus also makes a pit-stop at Gulbargah. Five buses are now plying to Belagavi from the earlier one that was operating last month. The buses were suspended due to rising Covid-19 cases in the second wave. After some interstate buses resumed operations last month, bookings could be done in-person from the KTC bus terminus. KTC has now reopened its online ticket booking for passengers. Currently buses coming from other states to Goa have a 70% occupancy while buses leaving from Goa to other states have a 40% capacity, Ghate said. “We may increase the number of buses on these routes depending on the demand and footfalls.” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ktc-restarts-interstate-buses-to-outstation-locations/articleshow/86077744.cms||Nida Sayed
---||Delhi||Paying rent for poor: Delhi high court seeks status||NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Friday granted two weeks to the AAP government to decide on implementing chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s promise to pay the rent if a poor tenant was unable to do so during the pandemic. Delhi government’s counsel Gautam Narayan informed justice Rekha Palli that the matter was under consideration and sought two weeks to reach a conclusion. The court was hearing a plea alleging wilful disobedience of an earlier order about taking a decision in this regard in six weeks. On July 22, the court had ruled that a CM’s promise to citizens was enforceable and directed the AAP government to decide within six weeks about the state paying rent on behalf of a poor tenant who are unable to do so on account of Covid-19. The petitioners, who claimed to be daily wagers and workers seeking enforcement of the promise made by Kejriwal during a press conference on March 29 last year, stated in their application that the failure of the authorities in taking a decision impinged upon their right to shelter. The deadline fixed by the court ended on September 2, but the government failed to come up with a policy. This prompted the petitioners, Najma, Karan Singh and Rehana Bibi, to move court for compliance. The plea added that until a decision was taken, a “clear policy” on the payment of rent couldn’t be formed. In the earlier order, justice Prathiba M Singh had held, “A statement given in a consciously held press conference, in the background of the lockdown and the mass exodus of migrant labourers, cannot be simply overlooked. Proper governance requires the government to take a decision on the assurance given by the CM, and inaction cannot be the answer.” The court had said the assurance was not a “political promise”, but a statement made by the CM. “The statement was not made by a government functionary at a lower level in the hierarchy, who could be devoid of such knowledge. The CM is expected to have had the said knowledge and is expected to exercise his authority to give effect to his promise/assurance,” added the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/paying-rent-for-poor-hc-seeks-status/articleshow/86101367.cms||---

The robbers also thrashed an employee who tried to resist the robbery. Police have got some CCTV camera footage, but their images are unclear due to darkness. According to police, the incident took place at 12.15 am when two robbers armed with pistols entered the office of the petrol pump where the employees were calculating day’s earnings and UPI payments. “We had closed the petrol pump at 11pm on Wednesday and had put a long rope so that customers did not come inside. We were checking the transactions when two youths with pistols entered the office. Both threatened to kill us and asked to take out all the money we had in the cash box,” said Ramesh, an employee. Soon after the incident, the petrol pump employees intimated the owner and later to police. Cops reached the spot almost an hour after the incident. “We are checking CCTV camera footage and have initiated technical surveillance to identify the robbers. Prima facie it appears that robbers were locals and must be residing within Jaipur. They put Rs 1.5 lakh looted from the petrol pump in their pockets. According to the petrol pump employees, they were looking nervous,” said a senior police officer of Lal Kothi police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/armed-robbers-loot-rs-1-5-lakh-from-petrol-pump/articleshow/86082329.cms||---

Chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami made the announcement while attending a webinar. He laid stress on the need to strike a balance between development and conservation. The cost of around 250 vehicle charging points across the state – estimated around Rs 10 crore – will be borne by the Uttarakhand pollution control board (UPCB). “The aim is to promote pollution-free vehicles in the state as we are already battling against the smoke of forest fires and tourist vehicles. At least our local vehicles should be electric so that pollution to an extent is reduced,” said Anand Bardhan, additional chief secretary, state forest and environment department. The state has also decided to bear the cost of electricity of the charging centres, SP Subudhi, a UPCB member, said. Subudhi added, “In the first two years, it would cost around Rs 10 crore and our UPCB will bear its cost. The electricity will be charged at domestic rates, not commercial.” The UPCB has been trying various ways to promote sustainable living. Earlier, it had stated "for a house map clearance from the development body, soon, one has to submit both solar panel and rain water harvesting plans of their residence". A book 'Himalaya Diwas' under the aegis of Himalaya United Mision was also launched at the event. Environmentalist and Padma Bhushan awardee Anil Joshi was present. The Himalaya Day was also celebrated in other national institutions of Dehradun. Scientists at Wildlife Institute of India (WII) cited an urgent need to scientifically study the Himalayas before the changing climate impacts its original flora and fauna. “With some of the finest technological advancement and quick equipment like drones, the pace of research and executing conservation strategies in and around the Himalayas should be our top priority,” said Dr GS Rawat, ex-dean of WII.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/in-uttarakhand-first-1000-registered-electric-four-wheelers-to-get-rs-50k-subsidy-from-state/articleshow/86072390.cms||Shivani Azad

Speaking after unveiling the statue of Bhartendu Harishchandra, the renowned Hindi writer, novelist and playwright of modern India, on his anniversary at the Bhartendu Natya Akademi named after him, Yogi said, “Jo boli hum boltey the usmein aise shabd jud gaye jissey khichdi pak gayi…(The addition of words from other languages in our dialect has created a mixture).” “The writings of Harishchandra reflected a nationalistic approach which needs to be recapitulated. The poet lived for just over 34 years, but left an indelible mark on Hindi literature,” Yogi added. “How long you live is not important. How you live is important,” the CM said at the programme organised by the state culture department and attended by family members of Harishchandra. The programme was part of the series of events organised to celebrate the centenary year of the Chauri Chaura incident which holds a special place in India’s struggle for freedom. The chief minister urged different state departments to identify such figures and organise events in their memory. This would make ‘Amrit Mahotsav’ more meaningful and would inspire people, he added. The CM also urged the students of Bhartendu Natya Akademi to take inspiration from the writings of Harishchandra and play an active role in helping the country attain all-round development. Yogi said Prime Minister Narendra Modi brought a new education policy in 2020 entailing education for children in their mother tongue. “This will help students in imbibing the lessons easily and applying them in their lives,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cm-foreign-words-got-added-to-local-dialects-after-invasions/articleshow/86082353.cms||---

On Thursday, MP JUDA office-bearers were also directed to vacate their hostels and warned of action under Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA). “Junior doctors have been served notice to return to work and officer-bearers have been asked to vacate the hostel,” confirmed Gandhi Medical College (GMC) dean Dr Jiten Shukla. Sources also said that action under ESMA can come as soon as midnight on Friday. By evening, list of 12 junior doctors asked to vacate GMC hostel, increased to 21. “We will continue the fight for our demands. The government first targeted three doctors and now the number has gone up. All 3000 JUDA members will remain on strike until our demand is met,” said MP JUDA representative Dr Harish Pathak. The last arrest for going on strike, was around 2012-13 when state government arrested nursing staff in the medical college. MP JUDA is demanding withdrawal of an order issued during the week-long stir two months ago. The order called for cancellation of registration of three top MP JUDA office-bearers. Hospital services in Bhopal’s largest tertiary care hospital was one of six medical colleges where JUDA is on stir. Government-run medical colleges in Indore, Sagar, Gwalior, Jabalpur and Rewa were also adversely impacted. Senior residents and other doctors are attending to OPD duty.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Fake medicines for cancer patients seized, 3 arrested||NEW DELHI: A consignment of spurious medication meant for the treatment of cancer patients was seized from three people in southeast Delhi's Jasola Vihar. Sources said police are probing whether the counterfeit medication was produced in another country. TimesViewAny form of adulteration is a crime. But selling fake drugs to cancer patients is particularly reprehensible. Only early conviction and exemplary punishment can act as deterrence to such crimes. Authorities must be alert to any other such rackets in operation.Police said they received information about the three people who allegedly sold fake medication to the kin of cancer patients at high prices. The informant told the cops on Wednesday morning that the three would visit Jasola Vihar. “A trap was laid and a team caught the trio,” sources said. The cops seized more than 100 packets of fake medicines from the three accused. “One of the packets had a label stating it was manufactured in Bangladesh. We are probing this,” sources said. On being asked to produce documentation for carrying the medicines, the trio had no answers. “They were not carrying any documents or medical slips,” the officer said. Police seized 73 packets of drugs labelled as Palbocent and Lenvanix — medication used to treat cancer — from one of the men. “We also seized medicines labelled as Osicent, Crizocent, Ibrucent from the other two,” said a police officer. The medicines were checked by drug inspectors, who declared them as doubt quality. The trio was taken to the police station for further questioning. Sources said they are probing their links in other states and also how many, people were duped by them. It is not the first time Delhi Police has caught people with fake medicines. In June this year, police arrested 10 people, including two doctors, and busted a unit manufacturing fake life-saving drugs meant to treat Covid-19 patients. In May, cops arrested two people who were cheating Covid patients by selling fake Remdesivir at exorbitant rates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/fake-medicines-for-cancer-patients-seized-3-arrested/articleshow/86080303.cms||---
---||Delhi||Waiting for reply on evidence copy since April: JNU students||New Delhi: The counsel for JNU students Natasha Narwal and Devangana Kalita told a court on Friday that their application seeking a copy of electronic evidence in a northeast Delhi riot case was filed five months ago, but the prosecution was yet to file a reply. “We moved this application in April. Five months have passed. We haven’t received a reply yet. Where is the scope of Section 207 application if there is no speedy redressal,” the lawyer said during the hearing of the case in which the students have been booked under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. The prosecution told additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat that it would take time to file the reply as the data was voluminous and further investigation was on. “What they are asking for is all the digital data that have been seized. What has happened is, during the course of investigation, the agency called various people and they were interrogated. Volume of data that has come out is huge. That data contains personal data of people whose equipment are seized. It will infringe upon their privacy… It contains their financial data and their personal data,” special public prosecutor Amit Prasad claimed. Advocates Adit Pujari and Tusharika Mattoo, appearing for the students, said the prosecution should at least file an application seeking time from the court. Prasad further said police had supplied to the accused whatever they had relied upon and added that he would file a reply. During the hearing of an application filed by co-accused Asif Iqbal Tanha seeking a cloned copy of his phone, counsel Sowjhanya Shankaran said the prosecution had filed three chargesheets, 65-odd pages of material that they claimed they had retrieved from Tanha’s phone. “They haven’t provided recordings of the alleged speeches. They also rely on five WhatsApp groups that they claim are from his phone… This is his phone. This isn’t a privacy issue. This is material already relied on. It’s their bounden duty to provide him this. I need to know the entire content relied on by them. It’s not the job of the prosecution to pick and choose what to rely upon,” she said. Another accused, activist Khalid Saifi, told the judge that he would file a case against Delhi Police for wasting about 2 million precious papers by filing a chargesheet that ran into more than 17,000 pages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/waiting-for-reply-on-evidence-copy-since-april-jnu-students/articleshow/86101391.cms||Usha Das

The exercise had to be conducted following an accident of muzzle brake-hit in March this year. This happened during an exercise conducted by the Army with the guns that have been already inducted. Muzzle brake is in front of the barrel. During the exercise, a shell hit the muzzle brake damaging it instead of flying off the barrel. Now termed as reliability firing rounds, the assessment is planned towards the end of the month. “An inquiry was conducted into the incident and some minor changes have been made in the gun. After this another round of firing will be conducted in the manner which the army does during its exercises. This will be done to further ascertain the gun’s reliability,” said a source. The guns are made in the Gun Carriage Factory in Jabalpur. The first lot of 6 Dhanush guns was handed over to the Army in 2019 (6 guns make one full battery). The production continues and so far the ordnance factory has despatched 13 guns with the last one sent last month. Shortly three more are expected to be sent. The incident has not affected the production order. However, the reliability firing needs to be done for full assurance of safety. “This will lead to its final deployment in various locations after which the Army can put it to operational use,” said the source. “The changes have been made in view of the incident. However, these are minor modifications with no change in the main design needed,” said a source who is part of the development. The Dhanush project, which was started in 2010, finally made way to the Army after a number of hiccups. It began with an incident of barrel burst. There were two muzzle brake hits earlier too. However, this has happened with guns of other make too. There are a number factors for the incidents both, involving the guns and also ammunition. “The issues have been eliminated during the process,” said the source. Dhanush is a 155x45 mm gun, which is higher calibre than the original Bofors — a 155x39 mm calibre. It has a higher range than the Bofors too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/after-muzzle-hit-desi-bofors-to-go-for-a-round-of-test-fire/articleshow/86080299.cms||Shishir Arya

The department is keen to attract investors to its newly launched Petroleum, Chemicals and Petrochemicals Investment Region (PCPIR) near the upcoming crude oil refinery. The investment region initially developed over 422 hectares and expected to attract $2 billion. There are three PCPIR regions in country — Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha. Pachpadra would be the fourth PCPIR region if the Centre approves it. But officials in RIICO said the ministry of petrochemicals and fertiliser has cleared the plan and the Union cabinet would give the final approval. “The approval is a formality now,” said the official. The approval will allow the Centre to build necessary physical infrastructure like airports, highways, railways, telecom and other necessary facilities in a time bound manner. Rajasthan will be participating in the industrial expo on petrochemicals in November where the industries department will also hold a road show for highlighting investment opportunities in the sector in the PCPIR. “It’s global hub of petrochemical industries and large companies in the sector gather in the event. We have already made a list of companies to speak to there. It is likely, Industries secretary himself will be there personally to speak to the prospective investors,” said the RIICO official. As regards to the investors’ summit, the department expects about 3000 delegates both from the country and overseas and there would be another 5000 who would be joining virtually. The thrust sectors that would be showcased for investments during the summit include petrochemical, auto, agri processing, electronics manufacturing, medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and sports goods manufacturing. Roadshows in seven Indian cities have been planned starting from September 3, whicle the same will be undertaken in eight overseas markets like the USA, France, Germany, Japan, England, South Korea and Singapore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-set-to-hold-investors-summit-in-january-2022/articleshow/86082391.cms||---

The labourers were working under it around 1am on intervening night of Wednesday and Thursday. The overload of ashes (likely to be around 40 tonnes) in the plant due to excessive round-the-clock production of power amid high-pitched demand of electricity in the state, is believed to be the reason behind the collapse. However, the thermal plant authorities claimed the reason is yet to be ascertained as the operation to rescue the labourer is underway by SDRF and NDRF. Meanwhile, the three injured are under treatment at Baran district hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/mishap-at-thermal-power-plant-leaves-3-injured-in-baran/articleshow/86082381.cms||---

---||Kochi||Finally, govt ups social security spend||Thiruvananthapuram: Government has decided to release the funds for Ashwasa Kiranam project, which was withheld for completion of procedures to weed out ineligible beneficiaries, in the wake of widespread criticism against non-disbursal of allocated funds. In its latest order issued on Sept 3, government has decided to release Rs 40 crore to beneficiaries, without waiting for completion of Aadhaar linkage of beneficiaries and production of life certificate, which were mandated to ensure that benefits do not fall into ineligible hands. The project is meant to provide assistance to caregivers of bedridden or mentally-ill/disabled patients. On Aug 23, TOI had come up with a report on the basis of the data of the planning board, that only 9.6% of the total funds earmarked for 22 social security schemes were spent in five months of the ongoing financial year till then. TOI had reported that the highest allocation among the 22 schemes was for Ashwasa Kiranam scheme for which Rs 40 crore was allocated, but nothing has been spent. Opposition leader VD Satheesan too had criticized the government, and said that its lukewarm approach for social security schemes, especially amid the pandemic, was unjustifiable. He had testified that several petitions were seeking his intervention to get funds released under Ashwasa Kiranam to bring relief to beneficiaries. Meanwhile, from a meagre 9.6% expenditure for the 22 social security schemes on Aug 21, the government has improved expenditure of allocations for social security schemes. It has touched 25.8% as on Sept 9, which is also poor expenditure going by the requirement of the hour. After the order regarding Ashwasa Kiranam was issued on Sept 3, the government has spent Rs 19.35 crore (48.38%) under this scheme till date. However, there are still eight more schemes out of the 22, in which no funds have been spent yet. These include cancer Suraksha fund for child patients, Snehapoorvam (scheme for providing financial assistance to orphans who are living with family, with their relatives, friends, or the support of the community), Sneha Sparsham (rehabilitation of unwed mothers and their children) and Thalolam (free treatment to the children below age of 18, who are suffering from kidney diseases, cardiovascular diseases, cerebral palsy, brittle bone disease) Meanwhile, social justice minister R Bindu said funds under Ashwasa Kiranam project had already been disbursed before Onam. “May be the order was issued later, but the funds were disbursed before Onam. Also, there is a delay in uploading the data in Planspace of the planning board, because of which the expenditure is seen as low,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/finally-govt-ups-social-security-spend/articleshow/86077854.cms||KP Saikiran

He added that an electric highway on the same route would soon be a reality. “India has the highest number of road accidents annually and a high number of casualties. Keeping this in mind, we have thought of setting up helipads as roadside amenities on national highways. The aim behind this is that it will help in cases of organ transplants. When a person dies in an accident and the organs are to be donated, then they can be transferred faster if helipads are available at regular intervals,” said Gadkari. Emphasising on the need to shift from the use of petrol and diesel to biofuels, the minister added, “I have always tried that we gradually reduce the use of diesel and petrol even for aircraft. Our farmers can help in generation of biofuels and in fact a private airlines had even used the same for a flight. We are also working on electric highways between Delhi-Jaipur which would help in curbing pollution. An electric highway is considered an energy-efficient option to reduce carbon footprint.” Gadkari also touched upon the fact that India had set the world record when it comes to construction of highways as well as roads with 38km being constructed on a daily basis. “The endeavour is to find innovative ways of development and in fact I have in the past also urged that we should be work on switching to sea planes like how it is done in many countries. Perhaps even the Indian Air Force can consider it”, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/roadside-amenities-to-have-helipads-gadkari/articleshow/86082441.cms||---

The pension has been resumed from April 2021, and an amount of Rs5,000 for the last five months was transferred into their accounts. Minister Sarang assured that the pension scheme that was started in April 2011, which has been discontinued twice, will not be discontinued anymore. The scheme was first discontinued in April 2016, as the state government argued that it was only for five years in which the Centre was sharing 75% of the financial burden and the state 25%. NGOs working among the gas victims, however, contended that the pension is meant for life and not for five or seven years and if the state government do not have the funds, they should ask the Centre to provide additional funds as the scheme was announced by the Union government. The scheme was, however, resumed in January 2018, for two more years but in December 2019, the scheme was again discontinued by the then Kamal Nath-led Congress government. On the gas disaster anniversary last year, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan had announced that the scheme would be resumed again and in July, an allocation of Rs5.40 crore was made through a cabinet decision to provide Rs1,000 to 4,500 gas widows from April 2021. During the function, Sarang also flagged off three ambulances for gas relief hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/state-govt-resumes-monthly-pension-for-gas-widows/articleshow/86080327.cms||Ashutosh Shukla

The tournament was scheduled to be held in Lucknow from October 12 to 17. It was cancelled last year due to Covid-19 pandemic. With Covid cases coming down and normal activities, including sporting events, resuming across India, players and sports lovers were confident that the prestigious badminton tournament will take place this year. However, the Badminton World Federation (BWF) on Thursday announced the cancellation. The BWF, which had to cancel several tournaments due to Covid-19 restrictions, however, did not specify the exact reason for calling off the tournament in India. Sources said the organisers had to cancel the event as air travel restrictions are still in force. “The Badminton Association of India has taken the decision in consultation and collaboration with local government authorities and the Badminton World Federation,” said the statement. “The BWF regrets the cancellation but remains committed to delivering a safe and structured series of badminton tournaments for the rest of the year, including the culmination to the HSBC BWF World Tour," the BWF said in a statement. “We were ready to host the tournament in October but the government did not give the permission in view of possible outbreak of the third wave of Covid-19,” said Arun Kakkar, general secretary, Uttar Pradesh Badminton Association. The cancellation of Syed Modi India International, a BWF 300 Series event, means India will not host any event this year as the other two events on the calendar -- the India Open 2021 scheduled for May and Hyderabad Open, to be held in August, were also cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic. “For a badminton lover like me, it is a great setback as we will miss watching international players in action yet again. The pandemic has brought much loss to the world of sports,” rued Syed Taqi Haider, a budding badminton player from Syed Modi’s family. Syed Modi was eight-time national badminton champion from Lucknow.

A division bench of Justice A Muhamed Mustaque and Justice Kauser Edappagath said it will consider the issue along with passing an order allowing registration of marriages under Special Marriage Act (SMA) through videoconferencing. Earlier high court judgments had insisted that the parties should physically appear before the registration authority. After allowing registration of marriages under SMA through videoconferencing, the court said it will now consider the larger question whether the right to demand digital services from the government is a fundamental right. The court said it is mindful of the fact that its decision would have far-reaching consequences in many essential services, including education. The court also referred to the SC judgment in Hadiya case in which it was held that right to marriage is a fundamental right, as it is integral to right to life and liberty. The court also noted the rapid evolution in technology and unexpected circumstances, such as the lockdowns, and said the law needs to be laid down but that the court requires more time for researching on it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/is-demanding-digital-services-fundamental-right-hc-mulls/articleshow/86077898.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Futala lake retaining wall damaged further by rains, overflowing water||Nagpur: The apathy of Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) and Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) towards a small breach in the retaining wall of Futala Lake along Vayusena Nagar Road has led to the breach getting bigger in the recent rains. With water level rising by at least two feet, the platform on the north-east side has been submerged. The recent heavy showers in the city increased the damage to the retaining wall resulting in the breach, confirmed Dharampeth zone executive engineer Anil Gedam. “As a temporary measure, NMC erected iron rods at a distance of 5 ft and all the open portion of the retaining wall will be barricaded,” he said. “With Ganesh festival round the corner, we do not want any untoward incident, so on priority basis NMC’s public works department started the work,” said Gedam. Team TOI also spotted the swirling water taking along garbage strewn near the lake’s platform into the lake. Even the overflow point of the lake towards the north-east side of the lake was choked, which too has led to the rise in water level. Congress corporator Kamlesh Chowdhary, under whose constituency the lake falls, blamed NIT and NMC for the sorry situation. The lake is dying a slow death, he said. Two years ago, a small portion of the lake’s retaining wall had breached on its east-north side. Today, a huge portion of it has collapsed, he pointed out. “Structural audit of the entire retention wall needs to be done on priority. The impact of ongoing construction activity at Futala Lake on the retention wall needs to be assessed,” said green activist and founder of Green Vigil Foundation Kaustav Chatterjee. “Due to continuous rain and broken retention wall, the Vayusena Nagar Road side of Futala lake is flooded. The wall has been broken for more than two years. Due to continuous rains, the level of water has gone up substantially and the overflow point is completely choked due to dumping of solid waste, resulting in flooding,” he pointed out. The flooded area usually has artificial tanks, hence, the area needs to be cleaned at the earliest, as Ganpati visarjan will start in the next two days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/futala-lake-retaining-wall-damaged-further-by-rains-overflowing-water/articleshow/86080363.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Nagpur||Raut takes U-turn, says curbs will not be reimposed||Nagpur: Three days after declaring that restrictions will be reimposed in Nagpur district ahead of festival season, guardian minister Nitin Raut on Thursday took a U-turn stating that it would not happen as Covid-19 cases were dipping.“The cases are fluctuating every day and the situation is not that alarming currently. But we are still watching the situation and keeping a close watch on the patients’ numbers,” he told TOI from Mumbai.On the reason behind Monday’s sudden declaration that triggered panic in the city, the energy minister said Covid cases had suddenly doubled on that particular day and a majority of them had completed double vaccination. “In the second wave as well, their numbers started swelling in a similar way and we failed to act that time. We don’t want to take any chances this time considering bitter experience in the past,” he said.Even municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B and collector R Vimala confirmed that there would be no restrictions in the current situation. “On Monday, the situation was tense as 12 patients were found from the same area, which raised concerns. As the numbers are not rising since the last two days, restrictions would not be imposed. We had a meeting of top officials from the corporation and collectorate to take stock of the situation on Thursday,” Vimala said.Raut’s U-turn came after relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar had already clarified next day that there was no question of reimposing curbs as the proposal was neither discussed by the cabinet nor by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. He had also assured that if the curbs were to be imposed, those would be in entire Maharashtra where cases were in much higher, and not just in Nagpur.On whether he had any discussions with the CM or cabinet before making such a declaration about restrictions, as Wadettiwar had denied that the topic was ever discussed in the recent past, the north Nagpur MLA admitted that it was not discussed in the cabinet, but he had talks with ministers concerned in this regard.Raut’s announcement had led to all-round criticism of administration under him, particularly from the trading and business community, who were looking ahead for some respite in the festival season. They warned to stage protests if forced to close shutters stating that such “irrational” moves would spell doom for small traders and shopkeepers. He was also trolled on social media.Even the doctors had flayed him for over restrictions without consulting the stakeholders and not taking into account bed occupancy or the infection rate.BJP had also warned to oppose any imposition of restrictions. Leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis had told TOI that there was absolutely no need to reinforce curbs and create panic at a time when economy was slowly picking up. He slammed the Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government for lack of coordination after Wadettiwar denied Raut’s plans to put curbs.Raut told TOI that he would be conducting a review meeting on Friday with top officials from the administration and police on how to control crowding at market places during Ganeshotsav. “We have already advised all citizens to strictly follow Covid-19 protocols like wearing masks, maintaining distancing and avoiding crowding,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/raut-takes-u-turn-says-curbs-will-not-be-reimposed/articleshow/86080358.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Delhi||J&K ex-MLC Trilochan Singh Wazir's murder planned since July||NEW DELHI: The investigation into the murder of former Jammu and Kashmir legislative council member Trilochan Singh Wazir has so far revealed that the conspiracy was hatched in July. His body was shifted to Lady Hardinge Hospital after being recovered in a highly decomposed state from a flat in Basai Darapur on Thursday morning. The prime suspect in the case, Harpreet Singh, had informed the landlord that the flat would be vacated on September 10. A police team from Jammu & Kashmir is in the capital, while two Delhi Police Crime Branch teams have gone to Amritsar, Harpreet’s home city, and another to Jammu. A three-member medical board has been constituted to carry out the postmortem. The second suspect, Harmeet Singh, can be seen in CCTV footage outside the building where the body was discovered. Wazir, who reached Delhi on September 2, was scheduled to travel to Canada the same night. He halted at the house of Harpreet, an acquaintance, where he was murdered. The investigators said the mobile phones of the accused were active till Wednesday evening. In her statement to the police, Harpreet’s girlfriend, who had been summoned to the flat on September 4, said she did not notice anything amiss in the house that day. A worried family called Harpreet about Wazir’s whereabouts. He fobbed them off by saying he was probably in quarantine at Frankfurt. Police revealed that when Harmeet also started getting such calls, he blurted out the fact about the murder, leading J&K police to inform their counterparts in Delhi, who found the body in Basai Darapur. The two accused can be seen In CCTV footage. Apparently, Harmeet had checked into an Oyo facility two doors away from Harpreet’s flat. Police are scanning the call records of the two men for leads.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/jk-ex-mlc-murder-planned-since-july/articleshow/86101421.cms||---
---||Lucknow||NIRF rankings out: 4 Uttar Pradesh medical institutions in Top 15||LUCKNOW: Four medical institutions of UP have found a place among Top 15 best performing centres in the country in the National Institutional Ranking Framework India Report for 2021. Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGI) has been ranked fifth in the country with a score of 72.45. The Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University, has been ranked 7th, King George’s Medical University Lucknow is 9th and the Institute of Medical Sciences, Aligarh Muslim University is 15th. Compared to the rankings of 2020, SGPGI and IMS-AMU retained their spots, IMS-BHU slipped by one rank and KGMU went up by one rank. Each of the four centers though improved their overall scores this year. In all 50 medical institutes in the government and private sector were evaluated. The ranking parameters broadly covered heads like teaching, learning and resources, research and professional practices, graduation outcomes, outreach and inclusivity and perception. Among dental institutes, KGMU Dental faculty is ranked fifth best in India, followed by IMS-BHU on 25th place, IMS-AMU at 26th place, Saraswati Dental College Lucknow at 27th place and ITS Dental College Hospital and Research Center Greater Noida at 40th place. In the dental category, 40 colleges had participated. Officials in the state medical education department said the achievement was motivating but efforts were on to further improve their performance. They said the state government was trying to encourage more medical institutes to participate in the rankings that enable assessment of capabilities. A former DG medical education said the improvement recorded by various medical education centres in the state was commendable but it must be used to fuel the spirit of advancement. “SGPGI Lucknow, for instance, is over 20 points behind AIIMS Delhi which has been ranked the best. However, the institute was just three points away from the third ranker CMC Vellore. A micro-analysis can help in identifying the gaps to drive improvement,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/nirf-rankings-out-4-up-med-institutions-in-top-15/articleshow/86082511.cms||Shailvee Sharda

Haphazard parking is still a major problem, mainly in core commercial areas of the city. Vehicles can be seen parked in an improper manner, leading to chaos in the paid parking lots. Besides, finding employees in the parking lots remains a huge task. After giving slips at the entry points and taking them at the exit points, the employees hardly can be seen inside the lots. Due to this anomaly, many times commuters park the vehicles in a haphazard manner instead of at the earmarked areas. Shortage of cones and unavailability of machines in a couple of paid parking lots to issue slips have found a mention in the detailed report the parking branch submitted to the municipal commissioner. Proper functioning and recording of the CCTV cameras remains a major challenge in some of the paid parking lots. The mobile app is yet to be launched and some networking issues have not been resolved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/deadline-over-paid-parking-lots-not-yet-smart/articleshow/86077930.cms||Deepak Yadav

---||Nagpur||API Mokashe breaks into male domain of detection branch||Nagpur: Assistant police inspector (API) Mangala Mokashe is probably the first woman to head the coveted ‘detection branch’ or DB squad of a police station in the city. DB squad is known to be a male bastion due to gruelling hours, highly unpredictable nature of work, and tricky challenges like conducting raids, nabbing goons, detecting crimes and busting gangs and rackets. The work also demands involvement in the odd hours too. Incidentally, Mokashe was also the first woman officer to be posted in a field unit of crime branch a couple of years ago, when she was a sub-inspector. She worked in the Zone-III squad of crime branch. A sub-inspector of 2013 batch, 41-year-old Mokashe was promoted as API before being transferred to Mankapur police station from Ganeshpeth early this year. Mankapur police station’s senior inspector Vaijayanti Mandhawdhare, who too had created a benchmark as the first inspector of Bomb Detection and Disposal Squad (BDDS) in Vidarbha, asked Mokashe to head one of her two DB squads. “I felt why not give a woman the chance to perform in detection squad, as she already had some experience in the past and I don’t believe in gender discrimination in police work,” said Mandhawdhare. Mokashe responded to her senior inspector’s faith with successes. “I managed to crack an undetected robbery, nab a burglar from Wardha, and recovered two firearms and some weapons from two goons after a whole night chase,” said Mokashe, adding she was delighted to get the offer to head a DB from her senior inspector and grabbed it. “I feel no discomfort in working at any hours and rush out of home anytime,” said Mokashe, a native of Amravati, adding she is blessed to have supportive family members. Like Mokashe, it’s raining women officers at key positions in city with CP Amitesh Kumar for the first time giving three police stations to women senior inspectors, like at Mankapur. Aswati Dorje, an IPS officer of 2000 batch, too joined as the first woman Joint CP in city in the ongoing reshuffle of senior officers. Many police stations in city like Jaripatka, Dhantoli, Bajaj Nagar, MIDC, Rana Pratap Nagar, have women inspectors in the second position as ‘crime PI’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/api-mokashe-breaks-into-male-domain-of-detection-branch/articleshow/86080406.cms||Soumitra Bose

It is going under the hammer along with other properties across the country as part of airlines’ divestment plans.Originally known as the Indian Airlines office, the premises at Civil Lines near the Institute of Science has been a landmark since years. At a time when only the rich could afford flying, for many passers-by even entering the premises was a dream come true.The reserve price for the office — spread in an area of 27,200 square feet — has been lowered by 10% to Rs 33.3 crore. In the first round, the base price was fixed at Rs 37 crore. Although there were a number of inquiries, no one bid for the property when the e-auction too place on July 8. The second round has been scheduled on September 23 with the lowered rate.Pankaj Roshan, a real estate broker, said this is one of the prime properties of Nagpur. “A complex may change the face of the road,” he said.The building with a red-brick façade has been standing since 1992. The earlier office was near Sandipani School, also at Civil lines. Work on the building had begun in 1988-89. The premises at present has a built up area of 6,000 square feet and houses 10 staff.The employees here remember the times during the heydays of Air India and Indian Airlines. “This used to be a busy place in the 1990s. The parking lot used to be full with all high-end cars,” remembers Vasant Barde, the station manager, who has been here since 1992.Buying a ticket used to be an event. “People used to come here with their families and also enjoy the ambience that used to be there,” recollects Barde.It also housed the Air India office after the merger in 2007. Air India earlier had its office in Sadar.Once again the office here saw some hectic activity during the pandemic. Bookings for flight under the air bubble arrangement happened here. “Even though direct booking could happen, many came down here because it was difficult to get complete information elsewhere,” said Barde.“During the times when there was much uncertainty about the timing and schedule, staffers at the office were ready to help the customers. Even today bookings happen at the counters and customers also come for revalidation of tickets, cancellations and other issues,” he said.Soon the charm declined after the agents got booking portals and other airlines came in, said an agent.There were talks to hand the property over to the Nagpur Metro and retain a part of it. However, this did not work out. “A PSU oil company also had plans to take over it,” said sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/reserve-price-for-ai-land-in-civil-lines-lowered/articleshow/86080410.cms||Shishir Arya

---||Goa||Drawing inspiration from nature to worship Ganesh||Keri: Goa has been a predominantly agricultural land and villagers have for generations been expressing their thanks to Mother Earth by worshipping her son, the elephant-headed god in a multitude of forms. They worship Mother Earth in the form of the anthill, referred to as ‘Santer’. Her son they worship both aniconically and iconically. Folk researcher from Coparde in Sattari, Sarojini Gaonkar said, “On the auspicious occasion, devotees invoke lord Ganesh by placing betel nuts on betel leaves. Also, from ancient times Goans have respected the elephant-headed god by installing stone sculptures inside the temple.” During the period of religious persecution under the Portuguese colonists, the Shivlinga of Saptakoteshwar from Narve of Divar was transferred to Latambarcem and then to Hindole (Narve of Bicholim). While establishing the temple of the Saptakoteshwar Shivlinga here, a small shrine of a two-handed Ganesh sculpture was also established. Four-handed Ganesh sculptures came to be widely worshipped from the later Badami-Chalukya period. In 2015, a beautifully carved four-handed stone sculpture of Ganesh was found in Dingane in Cudne. A striking four-handed sculpture of Ganesh found in Canacona has in its right upper hand a battle axe and in the lower hand a bowl of ‘modaks’ (sweets). The left upper hand has a radish and the lower right hand a lotus. Besides stone sculpture, the most popular form of Ganesh worship prevalent in Goa is that of clay idols on the occasion of Ganesh Chaturthi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/drawing-inspiration-from-nature-to-worship-ganesh/articleshow/86077878.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar

The Uttar Pradesh Development Systems Corporation Limited (UPDESCO), which handles the portal with technical backup by a Pune firm, stated that ‘unauthorised access and interruptions’ were noticed on the website on August 26. A complaint was lodged with cyber cell of UP Police, following which an FIR was registered under Information and Technology Act. While the web page has not been restored, police too are yet to track the hackers. Assistant manager of UPDESCO, Rama Shankar Singh, stated in his police complaint that Vidhan Sabha site with a web address of www.upvidhansabhaproceedings.gov.in was hacked and misleading information published on it. UPDESCO receives technical expertise from a Pune-based firm, Persistent Systems Ltd, the FIR stated. A fortnight back, a Saharanpur man, Vipul Saini, had hacked into the Election Commission of India website. Additional director general of police, law and order, Prashant Kumar, said, since the site does not host classified data, no sensitive information was stolen or leaked. “The cyber cell will trace the hackers soon,” he added. A senior official in the cyber cell said, “a technical flaw was exploited to add an advertisement page of ‘sinusitis medicine’ from Vietnam. This was also reported in sites hosted by Nepal and United Arab Emirates, he said. “We are tracing the IP address of the hacker. Cyber scammers first intruded into the admin panel of the website, which is protected by a user id and password. This was decoded with an SQL injection to bypass application security measures that protect against data modification or deletion, before tampering with the website,” the official said. A fortnight back, a Saharanpur man, Vipul Saini, had hacked into the Election Commission of India website and created 10,000 fake IDs over a period of three months. Saini has since been arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/hackers-deface-up-vidhan-sabha-website-post-objectionable-messages/articleshow/86082565.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty
---||Delhi||Court rejects bail plea of Ambience group’s promoter in Rs 800-crore fraud||New Delhi: A court on Friday dismissed a bail plea of Ambience group promoter Raj Singh Gehlot in a money laundering case related to an alleged bank loan fraud of Rs 800 crore, saying the material on record suggested “meticulous” siphoning of funds and its “deft” layering allegedly by the accused. Additional sessions judge Dharmender Rana said a perusal of the chargesheet revealed that the accused, along with others, allegedly hatched a criminal conspiracy to cheat J&K Bank to divert/misappropriate its funds for personal use. “The amount spent, if at all that was spent, is nothing more than the spade work towards the ultimate objective of defalcating the public money,” the court said. Considering the intricate nature of offence and seriousness of allegations, a sustained custodial interrogation is desirable for unearthing the entire conspiracy and the modus operandi, it added. The court said the accused was a qualified chartered accountant and the crucial witnesses in the case were his acquaintances or relatives. The court noted the loan amount disbursed was allegedly siphoned off by Gehlot through various entities that were in his control or his family members/relatives and some firms existed only on papers. Advocate Tanveer Mir Ahmed claimed Gehlot, in judicial custody, had been cooperating with Enforcement Directorate (ED) since 2019 and no offence under the relevant sections of Prevention of Money Laundering Act was made out against him. But ED claimed that the disbursed loan amount qualified as proceeds of crime.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-rejects-bail-plea-of-ambience-groups-promoter-in-rs-800-crore-fraud/articleshow/86101433.cms||Usha Das

In Marcel, an idol maker has shaped them from a unique mixture of eco-friendly materials like papier mache, chalk powder, tree-based gum and shaadu maati or natural clay, which is more durable that plaster of Paris and lighter to boot. The idols fashioned from this mixture keep the tradition of clay idols alive with all the advantages of PoP idols. “I came up with the eco-friendly idea of making idols using papier mache and clay to reduce water pollution. We always hear about the adverse effects that immersion of PoP idols have on the environment. The material takes months to dissolve which harms marine life as the water is left polluted,” an artist from Marcel in Ponda taluka, Girish Navelkar said. Navelkar has sculpted 20 idols using his special mix. They are not only eco-friendly, but also just as attractive as their PoP counterparts, as well as lighter and more durable, Navelkar said. He said that they began working on the idols in May as they needed heat to dry the paper pulp which is made from newspapers that are soaked in water and then pulped. “The dried pulp along with small amounts of chalk powder, organic glue or tree-based gum, and shaadu soil are kneaded and placed in the idol mould. Once dried, it is coloured using food-based dyes. These idols completely disintegrate on immersion and do not pollute the ecosystem,” Navelkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-ponda-clay-papier-mache-idols-set-new-trend/articleshow/86077972.cms||Suraj P Kaisuvker

---||Chandigarh||FS letter to EO for keeping rules in abeyance not acceptable: SC||Chandigarh: The Supreme Court has raised questions on the UT administration’s communication on behalf of UT finance secretary to the UT estate officer for keeping Chandigarh conversion of residential leasehold land tenure into freehold land tenure, Rule 1996, in abeyance. The Supreme Court made these observations while providing relief to city residents who were seeking conversion of leasehold residential sites into freehold. A division bench of Justice Hemant Gupta and Justice AS Bopanna in its order dated September 7, said, “On the date when the letter was issued by the UT administration on May 10, 2013, the statutory 1996 rules were in force. Such rules were kept in abeyance on the basis of communication on behalf of the finance secretary to the estate officer. Such communication cannot be countenanced. The statutory rules cannot be put to hold because the issue of revision of rates of conversion was under consideration of the UT administration. Even after the said letter the rates were fixed only in 2017. In the face of valid statutory rules, an administrative decision cannot be sustained”. The order further stated, “The fact remains that in terms of 1996 Rules, an amount of Rs 1,710 per sq mt. was fixed as conversion charges. The land rates were to be fixed by the administration from time to time under rule 5 of 1996 rules. In annexure-A, the land rate for conversion was fixed at Rs.1710/- per sq mt. The same was to be applied for a period of one year. But as admitted at the Bar, the rates were revised only in 2017. The action of the appellant (UT administration) in rejecting the request for conversion is thus arbitrary and discriminatory. The request could not be kept pending when the statutory rules were in force. The executive authority could not by an administrative order keep the matter pending, when there was no other reason not to accept the conversion except impending increase in the conversion charges”. Advocate Vikas Jain, who was representing one of the affected parties, said that the Supreme Court, while exercising the power conferred under Article 142, directed the UT administration to decide the claim of conversion as on the date when consumer complaints were filed. The court has directed the administration to take action within three months, Jain added. BOX Pick-and-choose policy The SC order reads, “It is the stand of the appellant (UT administration) that no conversion was allowed after a letter was issued on May 10, 2013. The administration has, however, allowed conversion of leasehold properties into freehold even after the said date May 10, 2013, as conversion of plots bearing file no. RPL 19565 and RPL 19601, was allowed on December 4, 2013 and November 11, 2013, respectively”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/fs-letter-to-eo-for-keeping-rules-in-abeyance-not-acceptable-sc/articleshow/86078013.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

Otherwise the name of this state will be tainted. It is a shame that after 75 years there are such petitions. We will send the order so that the state should not be shamed further,” said a bench of Justices Shahrukh Kathawalla and Milind Jadhav. The petition, by the villagers, said they are supplied water twice a month for nearly two hours. They urged that STEM Water Distribution and Infra Company, a joint venture of Thane Zilla Parishad and Bhiwandi Nizampur City Municipal Corporation, be directed to supply water daily. They alleged STEM supplies water illegally to political leaders and tanker lobbies. Advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni assured a solution will be found for regular supply and removal of illegal water connections. He said STEM MD Bhausaheb Dangde and team will chalk out a plan. But the judges asked that a committee be formed with BMC commissioner Iqbal Chahal and additional commissioner Suresh Kakani to chalk out a plan. Petitioners’ advocate R D Suryawanshi urged at least 10 water tankers be sent for Ganeshotsav.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/hc-shameful-if-water-woes-persist-75-yrs-after-freedom-in-mumbai/articleshow/86082604.cms||---

Injured and bleeding, constable Arun Kumar made his first and only call to his senior, the superintendent of police (SP) of Baghpat, on Wednesday night at 10pm before passing out. ‘Sahab, mujhe goli maar di hai (sir, I have been shot),’ he told the SP. The help arrived quickly. A group of policemen rushed to the spot, on the outskirts of Baghpat, and took Kumar to a city hospital from where he was referred to another hospital in Ghaziabad in a critical condition. After over 24 hours, till Thursday night, no one knew who the attackers were and why constable Kumar was shot. Policemen probing the attack were still trying to get some clue about the attackers . “It all happened on the outskirts of the city and there was no CCTV camera installed there,” an officer privy to the probe said. Attached with emergency Dial 112 service, Kumar was out on night duty on his motorcycle when he was attacked. Police have found just one footage of the suspects from a CCTV camera installed several kms away from the spot where Kumar was found shot. “The suspects on a bike could be seen crossing the area several times, but their faces are not clear,” the police officer said. “It looks like those bike-borne men were going to commit some crime. And they shot at Arun as they thought that he was following them," he said. Baghpat additional SP Manish Mishra said, “We are trying to look into several factors. The constable's family is also being consulted to know if he had any personal enmity.” This is the sixth attack on a cop on duty in the state in the last one month. Three policemen were injured after a mob attacked them with clubs and stones in Bulandshahr’s Chaderu village when they had gone to arrest a youth in connection with a loot case on August 12. On August 29, a woman cop in Lucknow’s Aliganj area was hit on the face with a rod after she confronted a man for passing lewd remarks at her. The attack took place when she was patrolling in the area, in uniform. On August 8, a police constable and a home-guard were attacked allegedly by a BJP councillor in Meerut. The accused tore the uniforms of the cops when they were asking shop owners to shut their establishment during lockdown. On August 7, three policemen were attacked by a few criminals -- wanted in a loot case-- when their hideout was raided in Daurala area of Meerut. And on August 5, aides of a BJP MLA allegedly attacked a head constable and other policemen in Meerut’s Akalpura village.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/constable-shot-at-left-for-dead-in-ups-baghpat-6th-such-attack-on-cops-in-a-month-in-up/articleshow/86075811.cms||Ishita Mishra

Smith said this while participating in a virtual panel discussion on ‘Is the Future of Work, Hybrid?’ by the Indian School of Business (ISB). Referring to the US data, Smith pointed out that as more women prefer to work remotely, this could lead to risk in driving disparity in terms of gender equality at the workplace. He also pointed out that many people feel the current hybrid model of work is becoming ‘mechanical’ and there is lack of recognition. Chandrasekhar Sripada, practice professor (OB & strategic human capital) and executive director (human capital & leadership initiative), ISB, also pointed out that in India, companies are facing an uphill task in wooing their employees back to work. Josie Kang, VP, Human Capital Leadership Institute (Singapore), pointed out that in China, around 80% of the workforce is back to office already. However, when it comes to remote working, she pointed out that there are challenges around employee engagements, especially in the case of new hires. Carolina Yeo, partner, Future Work Forum (Europe), the transition to WFH was not very difficult in the case of Europe and the return to office is depending solely on distinct requirements of various sectors. Yeo also added that in many places, offices are being redesigned and employees may not have fixed desks anymore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/out-of-sight-may-be-out-of-mind-for-employees-in-wfh-era-say-experts/articleshow/86080499.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh CM Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy lauds role of banks in supporting economy||VIJAYAWADA: Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy commended the banks’ role during Covid 19 crisis in the state. He wanted the bankers to continue their contribution through lending in the years to come as Covid-19 is causing economic crisis too. The chief minister addressed the State Level Bankers Committee (SLBC) meeting at his Tadepalli camp office on Thursday. He said that the national GDP had come down by 7.25 per cent during 2020-21 due to Covid 19, while the state GDP had seen the fall by only 2.58 per cent. This was mostly due to the intervention of the bankers, Jagan said. However, he said that the banks have dropped the term loans by Rs 3,237 crore and the agriculture loans by 1.32 per cent. The chief minister asked the banks to extend better loans to the tenant farmers this time. He said that the government had issued 4,91,330 crop cultivator right cards to the tenant farmers and the data was incorporated in the e-cropping portal. He wanted the banks to extend loans to these farmers and support them. The Rythu Bharosa Kendras (RBKs) have all this data including the crops and the expected yield. He said 10,788 RBKs were established in the state, where the farmers’ details and the crop details are available. The RBKs also have the pictures of the farmers and their crops, he said and asked the banks to utilise the data for their advances to the farm sector. Jagan also requested the banks to have their business correspondents in the RBKs to help the farmers’ community on priority, besides the general public. He welcomed the decision of the banks to have their business correspondents at 9160 RBKs, where 6538 business correspondents are working. He explained to them the YSR Cheyuta scheme where the government is providing financial assistance to women to have self-employment activities. He wanted the banks to go to the rescue of these women and promote their business activities. He said that the corporate firms like Reliance, ITC, Procter and Gamble, HUL, Amul were already working with these women and asked the banks to assist them. The chief minister also told the bankers that the government had issued house site pattas to 31 lakh women in the state. They all have started construction of own houses, he said and asked the banks to extend financial support for the housing programme. He wanted the banks to support the MSME sector too during this crisis and explained how the government is helping them. Jagan addressed the State Level Bankers Committee meeting and said the national GDP had come down by 7.25% during 2020-21 due to Covid 19, while the state GDP had seen the fall by only 2.58%.

The police are on the lookout for their three accomplices. Thane zonal DCP Vinay Rathod said the body of the victim, Hanumant Shelke (47) was exhumed on Thursday and handed over to his family for the final rites. Shelke’s family said that he had left home on September 1, to make payment for a worker’s medical treatment and never returned home. Initially, Kapurbawdi police registered a missing person’s case.

Under a drive, “Swaccha Goa, Swaccha Neura” by Kala Academy Goa’s College of Theatre Arts, the special bins were distributed in coordination with Neura panchayat for collecting Ganesha puja waste (nirmalya) and for other waste separately. “The waste is released in water bodies but since the festival is about worship of God and nature, how can we say we are doing that when we are causing damage to nature,” Purshottam Mardolkar, a student of College of Theatre Arts said. A team of students visited the idol immersion spots at Dhondbhat, Dhaktembhat, Devbhat and other water bodies to assess the problems of plastic litter, in a drive guided by Swapnil Bhaip, the college’s director of physical education. They also conducted an awareness campaign to sensitize locals about use of bins to protect water bodies.  “The motive behind distribution of bins is also to make the waste useful to the villagers after composting,” Chaitali Gawas, college counselor said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/initiative-to-protect-water-bodies-from-pollution/articleshow/86077779.cms||---

The step was initiated after the former UT administrator VP Singh Badnore in January had directed senior officials to work on regularisation of such construction. The lal dora (red line) separates village habitation from adjacent agricultural land. After Badnore’s instructions, some villagers had even started carrying out fresh constructions outside lal dora hoping it would be regularized. However, the teams of UT estate office and land acquisition department had demolished fresh constructions.

Sources said more samples were being tested. Health officials said the affected were being treated for cholera. Efforts are on to find the source of the contamination. Officials at Kamarhati Municipality said they were checking for leakages in Sasthitala, Kumorpara, Graham Road, Old Line, Dasubagan, Phoolbagan, Chingritala and Banerjee Para. “We held meeting with all the four authorities of water sources — including KMDA and PHE officials — and asked them to take a special measures to purify the water and to increase the chlorine level. The exact cause behind the contamination is being examined. We are also checking if there are leakages in water pipelines,” said North 24 Parganas DM Sumit Gupta. “Stool report of three samples found positive for Vibrio cholerae 01 Ogawa. This is not the classical cholera but it is a variety under the cholera group. Fortunately, this bacteria is sensitive to most of the drugs, including doxycycline, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin and azithromycin,” said director health services Ajay Chakraborty. According to the DHS, so far about 297 cases from Kamarhati Municipality have been reported at College of Medicine and Sagore Dutta Hospital (CMSDH). “Two deaths from diarrhoea were reported on Wednesday. No further death was reported today. Cases have come down. There were 35 cases on Thursday,” said Chakraborty. A health team, comprising joint director Dipankar Maji, district CMOH, CMSDH principal and public health experts from the district, has been formed for overall supervision and control of the outbreak. The team visited the affected areas, met local authorities, examined the water supply system and advised for adequate chlorination of water. Three medical camps were organised in these areas. “Such outbreaks are more common during and post monsoon. Identifying the source of contamination while taking care of the affected is very important,” said Dipika Sur, former NICED scientist who has worked extensively on cholera.

---||Hyderabad||Telangana wants 3 Andhra Pradesh projects in unapproved list||HYDERABAD: Continuing its tirade against the Andhra Pradesh government on irrigation projects on Krishna river, Telangana has requested the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) to put Pothireddypadu head regulator, Srisailam right main canal (SRMC) and Galeru Nagari Sujala Sravanthi at Bankacherla as unapproved projects and incorporate them in the schedule-2 of the gazette notification issued by the Union jal shakti ministry. The government also urged the Board to allow AP to draw only 34 tmc ft water during the flood period through Pothireddypadu head regulator and SRMC above 880 level. Telangana irrigation engineer-in-chief C Muralidhar wrote a letter to KRMB chairman MP Singh on Wednesday alleging that the AP government was illegally diverting water outside the Krishna basin from Srisailam. He said diversion of water from Pothireddypadu should be stopped as it was against the Krishna River Water Disputes Tribunal (KWDT)-1 and deterrent action should be taken against the AP government. “Srisailam was conceived as a hydro-electric project and only 33 tmc ft of water allocated for evaporation losses without any diversion from it for irrigation. In the inter-state agreements of 1976 and 1977, all the three riparian states agreed to divert 15 tmc ft of water from Srisailam to Madras for drinking water supply between July and October every year. It was clearly stated the diversion is only for Madras (Chennai) drinking water requirement and not for any other purpose,” the ENC said. Muralidhar said in 1984 against the inter-state agreements, CWC approvals and KWDT-1, the AP government had increased the Srisailam main right canal to 20,000 cusecs against the original allocation of 11,150 cusecs, also regulator capacity of the link channel to Madras water supply to 11, 150 cusecs, increased the regulator capacity of SRBC to 11,150 cusecs to provide irrigation facilities to more areas in AP and also introduced a new regulator, called escape regulator, with a capacity of 11,150 cusecs, which supplies water to KC canal ayacut which is totally in contravention to the KWDT-1 award and other agreements. “In 2006, the SRMC capacity was further increased to 44,000 cusecs and now reached 88,000 cusecs. An additional regulator for GNSS with 22,000 cusecs at Bankacherla was constructed,” the ENC said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-wants-3-ap-projects-in-unapproved-list/articleshow/86080525.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Kolkata||Trolley run 33m below Hooghly, stn check push for E-W project||Kolkata: Metro Railway general manager Manoj Joshi and other senior officials on Thursday took part in the maiden trolley run along the 3.8km Howrah Maidan-Esplanade section, halting to check the four stations en route. Undoubtedly, the most exciting part of their journey was rolling through the ambitious 520m east-bound tunnel 33m below the Hooghly river bed between Howrah and Mahakaran stations. Aboard four trolleys, Team Joshi included senior officials like KMRC MD Manas Sarkar. The twin river tunnels are part of the 16km East-West Metro corridor — or the country’s answer to Eurostar — that currently does a truncated 6.6km run between Sector V and Phoolbagan, and will eventually join Howrah Maidan in the west with Sector V in the east. Even as KMRC is executing the project, Metro Railway is the umbrella body for Kolkata’s rapid transit system, including East-West Metro. The debut trolley run was, therefore, conducted by none other than GM Joshi himself. “Trolley inspections are fun because the third rail is not charged and one can get off anywhere,” a KMRC official said. The trolleys started rolling from terminal Howrah Maidan station at 10.30am, stopped at the stations dotting the stretch, before ending around 1pm at Esplanade. Joshi checked work progress of cross passages inside the east-bound tunnel where track-laying till Esplanade was completed in July. Track-laying of the westward tunnel has been done till Mahakaran station. “In another 10 days, the 800m stretch till Esplanade (west-bound tunnel) should be over, an engineer said. And then we start bridging the 2.5km Esplanade-Sealdah section of both the tunnels by laying the tracks,” an engineer said. This part of the track-laying has been delayed because of the disaster on August 31 in 2019, when a TBM hit an aquifer at Bowbazar, causing severe subsidence. Afcons is the construction major contracted to build the 3.8km Howrah Maidan-Esplanade segment, including the 520m underwater tunnels. It is also building the stations. Joshi got off at the stations to survey the traction substations, power supply systems, ventilation, air-conditioning, platform screen doors and station entry-exits. Kalindee-Rahee, a joint venture company, is the one contracted to lay the ballastless tracks from Sector V to Howrah Maidan. KMRC has imported head-hardened rails from Austria’s Voestalpine Schienen for laying the tracks, except for those at the Salt Lake depot.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: In a first, traffic police to launch anti-pollution drive||KOLKATA: The traffic police on Wednesday asked traffic guards to conduct pollution tests on vehicles at random, especially since there has been an explosion of private cars and bikes on the roads to avoid jostling on public transport in Covid times. The task to keep a check on toxic fumes from vehicles was so far restricted to the anti-pollution cell of Lalbazar but Kolkata Traffic Police decided to step in for the first time. A Lalbazar source said the drive is being launched following complaints from environmentalists, who pointed out that several vehicles claimed to have pollution certificates but were flouting the norms and wreaking havoc on the environment. The smoke meters that 20 of the 25 traffic guards had bought almost two years ago and had been lying idle will finally come to use, probably from Wednesday. “We decided to train our men in using the devices. We took help of Pollution Control Board officials and also, sent the equipment for servicing. The few guards—Garia, Southwest, Bhowanipore and Metiabruz—which do not have the devices will procure them, too,” said a Lalbazar officer. DC (Traffic) Arijit Sinha confirmed that an instruction had been passed to ensure the drive started from Wednesday. “Several guards have already carrying out checks and the others will follow suit. The force should be concerned about the environment, especially when there has been a boom of private four-wheelers and two-wheelers. We want to ensure these checks are carried out extensively,” said Sinha. Environment activists, like Subhas Datta and S M Ghosh, welcomed the move, saying there was no point arguing over jurisdiction. They agreed on the fact when the transport department lacked enough manpower, allowing highly polluting vehicles to go scot free, some police action to curb pollution was always necessary. Police also pointed out that since their personnel, who were constantly out on roads, inhaled the toxic fumes, they were ready to control it. “The traffic guards undertake a number of drives, they can carry out this additional responsibility,” said an officer. In a bid to ensure a clean environment, Kolkata Police had planned to set up a database of drivers in the city to ensure they procured their Pollution Under Control (PUC) certificates on time. The police also have two other proposals to check rising air pollution: First, they may not allow renewal of PUC certificates if traffic challans are pending and secondly, efforts are on to centrally preserve the PUC certificates of all trucks entering the city. “Many PUC certificates, especially those issued to trucks outside Kolkata, have turned out to be fake. In some cases, the carbon deposit tests are carried out with accelerators pressed at 60-70 km/hr, though the standard is 90 km/hr,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/in-a-first-traffic-police-to-launch-anti-pollution-drive/articleshow/86080566.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

She said this was evident from TDP general secretary Nara Lokesh burning the copies of the Act. She was addressing reporters after the family members of Ramya, an engineering student who was stabbed to death, called on chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy. She demanded TDP leaders to support the Disha Bill in Parliament through their MPs to get it cleared by the Centre if they are sincere about the safety of women. “Many crimes against women were reported during the TDP rule, but the previous government didn’t put any efforts to bring an Act like Disha to protect women,” she said. The home minister slammed Lokesh for trying to politicise every incident. “He has very minimal understanding of law enforcement. The police have been working in the spirit of Disha Act, though the Act has not yet come into force,” Sucharita said, adding that the accused in the Narasaraopet case was arrested immediately and a charge-sheet was filed within a week. Sucharita assured that the state government will always stand by Ramya’s family. “We have already provided assistance by paying 10 lakh, offering a job of junior assistant to Ramya’s sister. The government has sanctioned a house site of five cents and five acres of land to the family,” she said, adding that the chief minister directed to provide the compensation within 10 days and establish a fast track court if possible in this case to punish the accused at the earliest. Sucharita said the Disha Act is yet to come into force and Lokesh isn’t even aware of the status of the Bill. “The accused involved in the Narasaraopet woman murder case was arrested immediately and the charge-sheeting was completed within seven days,” Sucharita said. She said Lokesh was planning to hold a dharna in Narasaraopet under the guise of consoling the victim’s family members and hence no permission was granted for his visit. Earlier, Guntur police intercepted and arrested Lokesh and other TDP leaders while they were en route to Narasaraopet from Gannavaram airport.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/lokesh-has-no-respect-for-disha-act-sucharita/articleshow/86078075.cms||---
---||Delhi||Mental health: Aid at your doorstep in Delhi||NEW DELHI: With mental health emerging as a major concern amid the ongoing pandemic, Delhi government is working on a proposal to implement an on-ground outreach through 11 mobile mental health units (MMHUs), one for each district. Institute of Human Behaviour and Allied Sciences is steering the execution of the plan in collaboration with state authorities. These mobile units will be available in fully equipped ambulances that will not just rescue and assist with treatment of homeless and homebound severe cases of mental illness, but also connect people in need with counselling and follow-up services. The facility will also assist mentally distressed survivors of domestic violence and cases where a person may have attempted or is known to be suffering from suicidal thoughts. It is eventually proposed to further expand the outreach to two MMHUs in each district, according to IHBAS director Dr Nimesh Desai who is guiding the execution plan. Soon after the second wave the Delhi high court too had taken cognisance of the MMHU proposal and has sought its implementation as the earliest. Desai said that this project is the need of the hour as there is growing threat of rise in depression due to the pandemic induced distress. He cautioned that untreated depression can be a trigger for suicidal thoughts. He shared the case of a 28 - year - old woman who had attempted suicide twice and was brought to IHBAS three months back. It turned out that the trigger for her depression had its roots in loss of livelihood. A single mother and lone breadwinner for her two children, the woman who worked as a beautician in Faridabad had seen her clientele dwindle over the course of the year leaving her helpless. These mobile units will draw upon the experience of two MMHUs that began in pilot mode over a decade ago at IHBAS. Between 2012-21, the mobile unit has received 3,780 calls from those who sought help. The teams reached out to 1,220 patients who required an assessment. Over these years, 349 patients were brought for treatment to IHBAS by the mobile units and of these 113 were homeless persons. Desai said the expansion plan will expand the reach and gamut of services that the current mobile units provide. “Suicide prevention and counselling domestic violence survivors is part of the plan as the proposal eventually plans to base these mobile units in districts and connect the counsellors and medical officers in-charge with hospitals, district authorities, police and voluntary sector to enable coordinated community outreach,” he explained. Cautioning that the pandemic’s toll on mental health has been rather severe, Desai said data of the Crisis Support and counselling Centre at IHBAS showed calls increased soon after the first lockdown in March 2020 and peaked in July - August. The key concerns at that stage were anxiety, domestic violence, fear of Covid-19 infection, obsessive compulsive disorder, behavioural and adjustment issues. Again during the second wave in 2021, calls started increasing in May and peaked in June. This time the callers spoke of loss and grief, hopelessness and helplessness, stressors (financial, uncertain future), severe stress and trauma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mental-health-aid-at-your-doorstep/articleshow/86101469.cms||Ambika Pandit
---||Chennai||Kodanad: Police go to Nepal to trace witness||UDHAGAMANDALAM: The Supreme Court-permitted further police probe into the murder-burglary at Kodanad estate moved to top gear with three defining events reported on Thursday. One: A special team left for Nepal to trace and bring Krishna Bahadhur Thapa, the only eyewitness to the trespass, murder and heist in the intervening night of April 23 and 24, 2017. Two: Having virtually reopened probe against all the 10 accused persons, police summoned eight of them to present themselves before the team on Thursday. Three: Probe team now plans to recall some of the witnesses who were ‘dispensed with’ by the earlier team. While Krishna Bahadhur Thapa’s co-security person Om Bahadhur Thapa was killed by the intruders, Krishna Bahadhur escaped with injuries. After his examination, he left for Nepal and his whereabouts are not known at present. During trial in 2019, the court directed the prosecution to produce Thapa for further examination, but police could not produce him in court. Of the 10 accused people, while primary suspect K V Sayan has been examined, Walayar Manoj is lodged in Central Prison, Coimbatore. The remaining eight are out on bail and residing in Kerala. Two of them — Samseer Ali (Accused-4) and Jithin Joy (Accused-10) — were asked, through WhatsApp message-summonses, to appear before police on Thursday. However, their counsel informed police about their difficulty in reaching Ooty the same day from Thrissur in Kerala. Sources told TOI that fresh summonses would be sent to all the accused and their inquiry will begin from Monday.Though originally 103 witnesses had been named, the then police team dispensed with 62 of them, retaining only 41 for the trial. Among the ‘dispensed with’ witnesses was Natarajan, manager of Kodanadu estate. He had been summoned and examined by the special investigation team headed by additional superintendent of police Krishnamurthy a few days ago. Another witness, Shaji (PW- 23) was summoned and questioned. Now, besides recalling some of them, police plan to inquire ‘important persons’ apparently connected with the case but not listed as witnesses earlier. A few more arrests in coming days cannot be ruled out, said sources. Meanwhile, inspector-general of police (west zone) R Sudhakar and deputy inspector-general M S Muthusamy are mostly camping in Ooty monitoring the inquiry and tracking developments in the investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/kodanad-police-go-to-nepal-to-trace-witness/articleshow/86080604.cms||Shantha Thiagarajan

The list includes names of former mayor Poonam Sharma, who is currently member of national body of BJP’s Mahila Morcha; former nominated councillor Surinder Bahga, who is currently vice-president in Chandigarh BJP; and Hitesh Puri, chairman of Chandigarh Residents' Associations Welfare Federation (Crawfed). The inclusion of two BJP office bearers in CHB’s board of directors is seen as moved aimed towards upcoming Chandigarh municipal corporation elections scheduled to be held in December. Meanwhile, sources in BJP said there is resentment in some workers. A BJP worker requesting anonymity said Sharma had remained mayor on Congress ticket and had joined BJP in last Lok Sabha elections. Similarly, Bahga was also nominated councillor when Congress was in power and joined BJP last year and was made vice president. “The party is giving key posts to outsiders, who recently joined BJP, but there is no place for workers, who worked hard for party in the last many years,” the worker added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ut-appoints-3-non-official-members-of-chb/articleshow/86078102.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti
---||Mumbai||Zoo income up as entry rates rose: Opposition seeks white paper||MUMBAI: A day after municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal defended the Rs 15 crore penguin maintenance tenders, saying that Byculla zoo’s revenue had risen by Rs 12.26 crore after penguins were brought in, elected representatives from the opposition sought a white paper on income and expenditure of the zoo since 2017. MLAs and corporators pointed out that in 2017 BMC had hiked entry ticket price for the zoo and the increase in revenue was not just because of penguins. In a letter to Chahal, Samajwadi Party corporator Rais Shaikh, who is also an MLA, said that the entry ticket prices were hiked from Rs 5 for adults and Rs 2 for children to Rs 50 for adults and Rs 100 for a family of two adults and two children. “Regular visitors could earlier get a monthly pass at Rs 30, which now costs Rs 150 a month. BMC has also spent around Rs 300 crore on other enclosures of the zoo. BMC must table a white paper on income and expenditure of the zoo before clearing these inflated Rs 15 crore penguin maintenance tenders,” Shaikh said. “If BMC is talking of profit and loss, then it has suffered losses due to penguins. BMC must specify the exact number of visitors to the zoo since 2017 and how many of them visited the penguin enclosure. How much money was spent on the zoo in the last five years besides the penguin enclosure. BMC must give these details instead of making bogus claims,” Shaikh said. Chahal had on Wednesday claimed that after arrival of the penguins, BMC’s revenue from the zoo rose drastically. BMC said income from the zoo rose by Rs 12.26 crore after the penguins were brought in 2017. BJP MLA Ameet Satam tweeted: “In 2017, entry ticket price was hiked from Rs 5 for adults and Rs 2 for children to Rs 50 for adults and Rs 100 for a family of four. BMC must present a white paper on the zoo’s income and expenses in 2017. Over Rs 300 crore spent on the zoo, tenders rigged to favour Highway Construction. The BMC chief must be out of his mind to justify,” .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/zoo-income-up-as-entry-rates-rose-oppn-seeks-white-paper-in-mumbai/articleshow/86080632.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

---||Goa||19 foreigners take vax shot in Goa||PANAJI: Even as there was a demand that foreign nationals in the state should be vaccinated, very few have come forward to avail of the benefit since vaccination was opened for them. As of Wednesday, a total of 19 foreign nationals were vaccinated, while five received their second dose, a directorate of health services official said. Of this, 15 people were from South Goa. “We thought many would come to get vaccinated specially in North Goa as it is likely to have more presence of foreign tourists. We do not know if some have been already vaccinated on the basis of their aadhar card as separate data about them is not maintained,” the officer said. After the announcement by the central government, a week ago Goa government also declared that it will start vaccination for foreign nationals and also those who took the first dose elsewhere, will also be eligible to get vaccinated here. If they had taken a Covaxin, they should approach a private hospital for the second dose as the government vaccine sites in the state offer Covishield. He said South Goa’s numbers may be more because those who got vaccinated are probably holding Portuguese passports. Dr Roshan Nazareth, a health officer at Candolim primary health center, said they haven’t seen foreign nationals walking in for vaccinations, of late. “Probably, there are no foreigners here,” he said. Since the pandemic broke out international tourists have not come to the state. Those who are seen are those who stayed back and they are spread across the coastal belts of North and South Goa. Arambol and Morjim has several Russians staying, whereas Bardez has African nationals. The coastal belt of Palolem and Agonda also have foreigners living there. No sooner, vaccination was thrown open for all sections of the society, there were queries on social media if they (foreigners) could also get vaccinated here, and what needs to be done. But now that the facility has been made available a few are coming forward, and that’s been surprising. Most foreign convicts and undertrials at Colvale Central Jail have been vaccinated. A few who refused to take the shot are consulting their respective embassies, a jail official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/19-foreigners-take-vax-shot-in-state/articleshow/86077699.cms||Bindiya Chari
---||Kolkata||KMDA probes Lake ‘violation’||Kolkata: KMDA on Thursday started a probe into the alleged construction of pillars in the water body by a club to expand its existing floor area at Rabindra Sarobar, a national lake and biodiversity hotspot. KMDA is the custodian of the Sarobar. Environment activists alleged that Lake Friends have erected concrete pillars in the water body to expand the floor area. Any new construction on the lake premises is in contravention of the National Green Tribunal order and a gross violation of Environment Impact Assessment 2017. The construction was spotted on Wednesday when they were trying to detect the source of water drainage. “We were shocked to find the new concrete structures encroaching into the water body. There was unmistakably a new structure. It is illegal and will harm the biodiversity of the place,” said Sumita Banerjee, a lake enthusiast. “Clubs around the lake have a tendency to encroach upon the water body. As much as 38% of the 192-acre Lake premises should be a water body. But we fear it has been reduced to less than 35% with time. We urged KMDA to undertake a proper mapping of the water body and demolish unauthorised constructions,” said Somendra Mohan Ghosh, an environment activist. “I have already asked the officers to conduct an inquiry into the complaint. As per preliminary inquiry, I was told that there was no new construction but some old constructions that are being referred to. Nonetheless, a detailed report was sought after a field inquiry,” KMDA CEO Antara Acharya told TOI on Thursday. The Lake Friends authority could not be reached as their phones went unanswered. A KMDA official said the club did not seek permission for any new construction but for some urgent repairs. If they erected any construction, it would be in violation of the NGT order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmda-probes-lake-violation/articleshow/86078109.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Hyderabad||Kokapet bid: Revanth files plaint with CBI||Hyderabad: Telangana Congress president A Revanth Reddy has filed a complaint with CBI alleging Rs 1,000 crore loss to the exchequer in Kokapet land auction. Reddy alleged that certain officials joined hands with public sector units and a few builders and caused substantial loss to the Telangana government. The government-owned e-procurement platform was being used by all departments, PSUs, urban local bodies as it has become mandatory for all government departments to conduct e-auction programmes from 2018 onwards. The government had engaged MSTC to conduct e-auction for land parcels. HMDA, which oversees sale of land parcels, had engaged MSTC. HMDA has called for the auction of 50 acres of land at Neopolis in Rangareddy district. Revanth Reddy, in his complaint to CBI, alleged, “Government allowed the intermediary (MSTC) to collect 2% for utilizing the e-auction platform. Considering the fact that the auction fetched Telangana around Rs 2,500 crore, the intermediaries had received Rs 50 crore. If the Telangana government platform was used, the commission would have been saved.” “As a quid pro quo for the commission, certain public servants of MSTC helped the public servants of the Telangana government in tweaking the e-auction norms and helped a select group of realty companies, which are close to the CM, pocket the prime properties at a throwaway price,” he said in the complaint. “Two real estate groups of Hyderabad, Rajapushpa Group and My Home Group, both close to the CM, got the land at a discounted price. Though located in the same area, the price variation between identical plots was more than 45-50%. For example, plot No 2/P was purchased by Rajapushpa Group for Rs 60 crore per acre, whereas the next plot (No. 13/A) was purchased by My Home Group (through a subsidiary Hyma) for Rs 31.2 crore. The entire 50 acres was purchased Rajapushpa Group and My Home Group. Rajapushpa Group purchased about two acres to give an impression that the cost of the land had gone up to Rs 60 crore per acre,” he alleged. “Rajapushpa and My Home had purchased more than 40 acres of land for less than Rs 35 crore per acre,” he revealed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kokapet-bid-revanth-files-plaint-with-cbi/articleshow/86080568.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

The government fixed Rs 40 crore per acre as upset reserve price for Khanamet land and Rs 35 crore per acre for Poppalguda land. The bidders expressed their worries at a pre-bid meeting organised here even as the Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (TSIIC) is getting ready to auction land parcels in Khanamet and Poppalguda. The bidders were particularly apprehensive in the wake of a court case on the recent land auctions at Kokapet. Some bidders sought instalment facility for payment. However, TSIIC officials said there was already a provision to make payment in instalments at various stages. The TSIIC issued a notification to sell 117 acres of government land in Khanamet and Poppalguda villages on September 27 and September 28. Of the 35 plots, nine plots are in Khanamet and 25 in Poppalguda. Official sources said about 60 people participated in pre-bid meeting.

While earlier, in the absence of a spouse, a deceased government employee’s parents or unwed/divorced/widowed daughters above 25 years, could claim family pension even though they themselves earned Rs 3,500 a month, now they can claim the pension even if they earn up to Rs 9,000. The finance department took the decision following the Sixth Pay Commission recommendations, as they had suggested to raise the ceiling limit of income of the dependants. A finance official said on humanitarian grounds, the income ceiling limit was done, so that aged parents could avail of family pension if their sons/daughters died unmarried or had no spouse. If the widow or the pensioner died, their unmarried/divorced/widowed daughter is entitled to get the pension. Even if she earned up to Rs 9,000, she could claim the pension, the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/govt-raises-dependents-income-limit-for-pension/articleshow/86080621.cms||---

Out of the total complaints received till September 10, around 42% were related to illegal dumping of garbage on roadsides or vacant land. According to the official data, the second highest complaints (17%) were about the presence of potholes on roads. While 13% complaints were on illegal dumping of C&D waste on roadsides, public land or floodplain of the Yamuna. The lowest complaints till data have been on vehicular pollution as just 38 cases were lodged on the app. Of the total 25,585 complaints registered on the app till September 10 this year, around 19,000 were lodged till mid of February. The maximum number of complaints was registered in the winter season when pollution is at its peak in the capital. However, around 20 complaints were received each day in the past six months. “Between March and September 10 this year, the maximum complaints were related to dumping of garbage and potholes on roads. However, as the air quality may deteriorate from October, the number of complaints is expected to go up,” said an official. Delhi government had launched the app to identify the areas contributing to pollution. Over 25 departments, which are attached to the app, were directed to resolve the complaints in 48 hours. For resolving the complaints lodged on the app, the environment department takes help of green marshals. Seventy green marshals have been assisting the environment department by conducting ground verification of complaints on pollution-related activities. Green marshals were initially appointed in October last year for six months but due to their good work, their service was extended for a year. An official of Delhi environment department said, “After a complaint is registered on the Green Delhi app, green marshals in the respective area visit the spot to verify the complaint. They fill the sheet with details of the complaint and it is passed to the department concerned. After the department concerned resolves the complaint, green marshals again visit the site to verify proper disposal of the complaint. If they are not satisfied, they reopen the case.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/25k-complaints-on-green-delhi-app-in-a-year/articleshow/86101501.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

Even as 58% of the adult population has now received at least one dose of Covid vaccines, the Centre advised people to come forward to initiate vaccination as even one dose of vaccines has proven almost 97% effective against mortality. While saying that vaccines were now more freely available, the Centre said there is no precedent anywhere in the world of schools’ reopening being delayed till vaccines are administered to children. “No scientific evidence, no epidemiology suggests that it should be a criteria. However, teachers and staff need to be vaccinated. Besides, parents should be covered. We have exerted towards that and there is a very high coverage,” Niti Aayog Member (Health) Dr V K Paul said. “The data show effectiveness of available vaccine against serious disease, particularly against deaths from Covid-19” Dr Paul said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cover-100-with-first-shot-before-fests/articleshow/86084470.cms||Sushmi Dey

The two students – 21-year-old Rachit Dumavata and Srinath Pawar, 20 – were returning home when they met with the accident. The duo had reportedly visited a restaurant in the evening on Wednesday to have dinner, and were en route home. Rachit, a resident of Chavatgalli, was riding pillion, while Srinath, who lived in Sadashivanagar in Belagavi, was riding the bike. Police said that the bike they were riding in rammed into the truck parked by the side of the road. “The driver and cleaner of the lorry were fixing a punctured tyre. It is possible that Srinath may have been riding the bike very fast, and not seen the lorry. Going by the evidence at the scene, it appears as though the rider lost control of the bike, and hit the lorry and the driver and cleaner. While the students died on the spot, the lorry driver and cleaner sustained minor injuries,” police said. A case has been registered in connection with the accident at the Belagavi North police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/engineering-students-die-in-accident/articleshow/86076835.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Wait longer for 360° view from Signature Bridge as elevator permit stuck||NEW DELHI: The wait for Delhiites to enjoy a 360-degree view of the capital from the observation deck on the top of the pylon of the iconic Signature Bridge is going to get longer. While the Signature Bridge was opened to traffic nearly three years ago in November 2018, a steel and glass observation deck on the top of the pylon of the bridge was completed much later. With a height of 154 metres, more than twice the height of Qutub Minar, the observation deck offers a panoramic view of the national capital. The pylon has a set of four elevators to take visitors to the top, out of which two are uniquely designed inclined elevators. A permission is required from Delhi labour department’s inspector of lifts to ferry tourists in the lifts, but since these are first-of-their-kind oblique elevators in the country, Delhi Tourism and Transportation Development Corporation (DTTDC), a Delhi government agency that executed the project, has been unable to get the permission. While the permission was denied earlier, DTTDC once again wrote to the labour department in July to allow it to use the oblique lifts to ferry visitors as similar lifts are operational in other countries. However, the corporation has once again failed to receive the nod from the department, sources said. As the pylon is shaped like a boomerang and is bent midway, the elevators on the two oblique legs of the pylon are also oblique at 60 degrees but with a levelled flooring. The pylon has been divided into four levels and DTTDC carried out some modifications a few months ago to make a changeover from the oblique elevator to the vertical one a more seamless one. The entry to the observation deck, whenever it is opened to visitors, would be ticketed.  The glass of the deck is laminated and toughened and can withstand wind speeds of up to 86 miles per hour.  However, with DTTDC not being able to receive the safety nod, it is not clear what the next move would be. Apart from being an important link between northeast Delhi and the rest of the city since it opened in 2018, the Signature Bridge has also become a favourite place for Delhiites to click selfies. That is why DTTDC is developing the area as a tourist spot as well. Last year in July, DTTDC had used state-of-the-art technology to provide aesthetic theme-based lighting at the bridge, with separate focus light on the cables. A dedicated ramp that will ferry tourists from the approach part to the main deck of the bridge is almost ready and there would also be a small parking facility, café and toilet near the approach area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/wait-longer-for-360-view-as-elevator-permit-stuck/articleshow/86080659.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Vijayawada||HC: No FIR under CrPC secs 107, 145||Vijayawada: The high court on Thursday directed the DGP to instruct station house officers across the state not to register FIRs under sections 107 and 145 of CrPC. Registering cases under the said sections is illegal and unsustainable, court said. One Bandi Parasuramudu moved the high court challenging the FIR registered against him at Atmakuru police station in Anantapur district under section 107 of CrPC. After hearing both sides, Justice Manavendranath Roy expressed surprise and wondered how the SHO could register an FIR under the said section by ignoring the fundamental principles of law. Justice Roy observed that the section in question clearly prescribes that an executive magistrate on the information of a cognizable offence or breach of peace and tranquillity by a person, should issue a show cause notice as to why he should not be ordered to execute a bond for keeping the peace, for such a period not exceeding one year or as the magistrate may think fit in the facts and circumstances of the case. Even after issuing the show cause, certain procedure has to be followed to conduct inquiry and pass orders in writing under section 111 of CrPC. Thereafter, inquiry under section 116 has to be conducted and a final order required to be passed by the magistrate concerned. Justice Roy further said that in the scheme of CrPC, the proceedings under section 107 are not penal in nature and are only preventive. It is not contemplated under law that an FIR needs to be registered to initiate proceedings under the sections, as it is not an offence for which FIR is to be registered, he said. He further noted that it is high time that necessary directions were given to those who are at the helm of affairs as the high court is coming across several cases where police in Andhra Pradesh are registering FIRs under sections 107 and 145 of CrPC. He directed the DGP to take necessary action in this regard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hc-no-fir-under-crpc-secs-107-145/articleshow/86078171.cms||Srikanth Aluri

Civil surgeon Dr Adarshpal Kaur said a total of 40 cases had surfaced this year. The district health department has advised residents to protect themselves from dengue fever and water-borne diseases these days. Civil surgeon Dr Adarshpal Kaur, district epidemiologists Dr Vikrant Nagra and Dr Harmandeep Kaur issued a joint statement urging residents to take precautions. They said that the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which causes dengue, breeds till the end of November. They also warned the people against the water-related diseases like diarrhea, cholera, typhoid, hepatitis A and E during the rainy season and warned them against drinking contaminated water. The civil surgeon said, ‘Though diagnosis of dengue causes fear and panic among patients, it is important to understand that many are simple fevers that can be treated at home. Normally, platelet count goes down with most of the viral fevers and all viral fevers should not be taken as dengue fevers. In case of dengue fever, good intake of fluids, healthy home food and complete bed rest is required.” Health officials added that dengue patients have high fever for five to six days. Platelet count may drop after the fever ceases. They asked private hospitals to report any suspected or confirmed dengue case to the health department and send suspected samples immediately so that confirmatory test could be done and remedial steps taken on time. Dengue testing and treatment is available free of cost in government hospitals across the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/23-dengue-cases-reported-in-9-days-health-dept-cautions-residents/articleshow/86078163.cms||Barinderjit Saluja

Though many processions were accompanied by DJ music, not all organizers had proper police permission. “We had been asking for permission from the cops after the state government announced that DJ will be allowed in the processions. But the city police department hadn’t given clarity till Thursday afternoon. I went to meet senior police officials along with many Ganesh pandal organizers,” said Swejal Vyas who has formed an organization Satyamev Jayate with the pandal organizers. “The cops said that they have sent out emails to all the police stations but most pandal organizers were clueless as they were not given permission by the cops till Thursday morning,” Vyas claimed. He added that many pandal organizers took out processions with DJ despite not having permission. “We just wanted proper clarity over the issue as the pandal organizers would be in trouble if they bring in DJ along with the procession without police permission,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/amid-confusion-djs-accompany-ganesh-processions/articleshow/86076443.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

DTP Priyam Bhardwaj said that a showroom and four shops constructed illegally at Bakshiwala village were demolished during the drive. He added that the shops were constructed without getting CLU (Change in land use) from the DTP office. The village falls in the protected area and change of land use certification is a must to make changes in the area, said DTP Bhardwaj. The landowners were booked under the Urban Area Act 1975 and under the Periphery Controlled Area Act 1952 as well as Controlled Area Act 1963. They tried to protest against the drive but police force and duty magistrate managed to control the situation. DTP officials said that land owners are often misled by property dealers, who engage in illegal commercial construction. Other land owners in the area were also warned of strict action, including three-year rigorous imprisonment, if found violating norms. DTP Bhardwaj requested residents of Panchkula not to construct any illegal structures on their land other than those earmarked for commercial work. The department has to give an action taken report on illegal constructions in the district to sports minister Sandeep Singh, who will visit Panchkula on Friday for a public grievance redressal meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/a-showroom-4-shops-razed-as-owners-protest-in-pkl/articleshow/86078235.cms||---

Vinod Mishra, BJP’s group leader in the BMC, said that Rs 350 crore had been spent on filling potholes but all crucial roads in the city be it SV Road or Link Road have potholes. The BMC maintains 2,000-km of roads in the city while the remaining stretches of roads are looked after by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bmc-31398-potholes-filled-in-five-months-in-mumbai/articleshow/86080702.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: To woo voters, municipal corporations plan property tax exemption||NEW DELHI: Aiming to garner support for the party in the civic elections scheduled early next year, the BJP-led municipal corporations are working on a proposal to exempt houses measuring up to 50 square metres from paying property tax. While the scheme is aimed at providing relief to the economically weaker sections as plots of such sizes mostly exist in regularised unauthorised colonies and villages, the percentage of voters is also high there. However, fearing serious loss of revenue, officials of the cash-strapped civic bodies are still in a dilemma. They argue that the policy would reduce property tax collection by at least one-third. Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta said the scheme would be implemented in all three civic bodies, so they had been asked to bring a common proposal. North Delhi Municipal Corporation leader of House Chhail Bihari Goswami said, “This segment constitutes 2.5-3 lakh properties and the decision is likely to reduce property tax collection by Rs 150 crore yearly. Currently, north corporation collects around Rs 565 crore. We will cover the losses by bringing more properties under the tax net.” “We aim to give relief to people living in Janta flats, small apartments and houses. The proposal was passed in the House meeting and will be implemented from this financial year,” added Goswami. However, north corporation officials are waiting for the other two civic bodies to come out with a similar proposal before giving administrative approval. South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) standing committee chairman Col (Retd) BK Oberoi said the issue was discussed in meetings where all mayors were present. “We suggested increasing the limit from 50 sq metres to 100 sq yards. The final decision is yet to be taken,” he added. SDMC earns around Rs 900 crore from properties in categories A, B and C. “Though the decision will reduce our collection by Rs 70 crore, people will benefit with 20-25% reduction in taxes,” said an official. The benefit would be given to owners who reside with only their family in such properties and the house has not been rented out. East Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor Shyam Sunder Agarwal as well as officials stated that unlike north and south corporations, 60% of their properties fell in this category and they couldn’t afford to give such relief. EDMC collects around Rs 210 crore from property tax of which Rs 100 crore comes from this category. “We have communicated our apprehension to the party. After a lot of efforts, we managed to increase property tax collection and now we can’t afford to go back. In east Delhi, residential properties start from category D and a majority are in E, F G and H slabs where houses are of 70 sq yards,” said the mayor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/to-woo-voters-corpns-plan-property-tax-exemption/articleshow/86101530.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Thane||Thane: Within 48 hours of opening, bridge develops pothole||KALYAN: Just 48 hours after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray inaugurated the Kopar bridge in Dombivli, on Tursday, a pothole surfaced on the bridge. Maharashtra Navnirman Sena workers were quick to blame the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) for the poor quality of work . TimesViewThe state government should consider this as an affront to the chief minister, who inaugurated this bridge just two days ago. This is the second time that the CM has faced such embarrassment. Last month, he had similarly inaugurated the Ghatkopar-Mankhurd Link Road. Within days, accidents occurred due to the road’s slippery surface and it had to be partially shut for repairs. Now, a pothole on the brand new Kopar bridge shows a total lack of accountability on the part of local authorities and the contractor who built it. The state must crack the whip and ensure the CM does not have to face such discomfiture again.Pictures of the pothole have been doing rounds on social media, with the netizens targeting the KDMC for the shoddy work. Meanwhile, after the controversy erupted, the KDMC on Thursday afternoon got the pothole filled. The corporation later issued a statement claiming that the bridge had been completed in a record time of one year and four months, but due to continuous rains, they were not able to use mastic asphalt on the road, resulting in potholes. The KDMC officials promised to complete mastic asphalt work after the rainy season ends. The Kopar rail over bridge is one of the important bridges in Dombivli which connects the city’s eastern and western parts. The bridge was closed for reconstruction on September 18, 2018 after IIT Bombay found it unsafe. The KDMC constructed the bridge with help of railways. Meanwhile, a human chain was organised on Wednesday at several places in Kokan to protest against an inordinate delay in the expansion of Mumbai-Goa highway.

He was involved in many cases of robbery, loot, murder and extortion. Police had announced a cash reward of Rs one lakh on his head. According to SP Jaunpur Ajay Sahani, on getting inputs regarding arrival of some criminals, the police of Sarpataha police station alerted Shahganj and Khetasarai police stations and also special weapons and tactics (SWAT) personnel after which the area was cordoned. A massive checking drive was launched after midnight. On noticing a motorcycle the police signalled its riders to stop but instead they opened indiscriminate fire on policemen. A constable Sanjay Kumar Singh suffered bullet injuries in hand while some bullets also hit the bulletproof jacket of SWAT in-charge AK Tyagi in this attack. In the retaliatory firing by the police one miscreant was injured and fell down from the motorcycle while his accomplice managed to escape, said Sahani adding that the injured miscreant was immediately rushed to a local hospital from where doctors referred him to the district hospital.

Now, only the Multidisciplinary Research Unit of Anatomy department of the Institute of Medical Science-BHU is conducting such tests, but it also has limited funds. The university stated that the dues of companies supplying consumables and drugs has gone above Rs 19 crore due to fund crisis, hence it decided to stop conducting tests at VRDL. These two labs have played a key role in the Kashi model of effective combating of Covid-19. VRDL in-charge Prof Gopal Nath said, “Except for patients of BHU hospital, the lab has stopped conducting RT-PCR tests of Varanasi and other five districts since September 1.” “Initially, in the meeting of university administration on August 7 we had decided to stop the RT-PCR test at VRDL from August 16. Divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal was also alerted about it. On getting assurance for pursuing the matter by the commissioner, we continued conducting tests till August 31. But, when no payments were made against the expenditure on lab consumables and other articles to clear the dues, we were compelled to stop the tests,” he added. Medical superintendent of SSL hospital Prof KK Gupta said, “Against the expenditure made at VRDL on RT-PCR tests, the volume of dues of suppliers of consumables and other articles had gone above Rs 15 crore. The dues against procurement of medicines for treating black fungus patients had also gone up to Rs four crores. As the figures of dues kept accumulating and pressure for clearing dues was increasing on the university, the matter was brought to the knowledge of BHU vice-chancellor, director of IMS-BHU and other authorities.” The varsity officials said that BHU receives grants from the ministry of education of government of India in which there is no provision for making expenditures on tackling pandemic. “Despite this fact, pressure was on varsity from local administration for tackling pandemic,” said prof Gupta adding, “Varsity extended full cooperation but now pressure of dues had compelled it to stop the services.” The samples of Covid-19 from Varanasi, Chandauli, Ghazipur, Jaunpur, Sonbhadra and Bhadohi districts were being tested in BHU labs. Prof Nath said, “Since Covid-19 first wave, 21 lakh tests including 10.50 lakhs samples of second wave were conducted at VRDL till now. The state government does give funds for consumables including microtip, PPE kits, masks, gloves, sanitisers, head covers, plastic plates for RNA extraction, PCR plates and others. On an average Rs 100 is spent on consumable on each RT-PCR test. Expenditure only on these items had gone above Rs 11 crore.” “Running VRDL lab, which has 14 RT-PCR machines, five RNA extractors and eight bio-safety cabinets of level-2, was proving difficult for varsity as it had also made huge expenditure on Covid-19 cases management,” said Prof Nath, mentioning that funds of Rs 9.5 crores had been received from the state government, which were spent on arranging the articles for Covid management. Regarding this fund of Rs 9.5 crores, the commissioner said that initially the administration ensured arranging of this fund in three instalments through the State Disaster Relief Fund. “But, BHU is a Central university, where funds are allotted through the ministry of education of government of India. Therefore, the state government has no role in it. The university administration and local administration had pursued the matter with the government of India. We will pursue it again to ensure that work is not hampered, especially at a time preparations are in full swing for anticipated third wave of Covid-19,” he added. In the lack of service of VRDL, now only Prof Royana Singh led MRU is conducting RT-PCR tests. “We are conducting 6000 tests per day. But, we also have limited funds, which can be used for continuing RT-PCR tests for a month or two only,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/bhus-vrdl-runs-out-of-funds-stops-rt-pcr-tests/articleshow/86080724.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

The incident comes close on the heels of a 14-year-old girl’s gang-rape case. According to police, the kidnapping occurred at 1.30am. “We were able to nab the suspect and rescue the girl from the commercial building within two hours of the kidnapping due to some vital clues provided by another autorickshaw driver, who had seen the suspect picking up the girl. He even followed the suspect for some distance before losing his trail,” deputy commissioner of police (zone II) Sagar Patil said. “The autorickshaw driver had noted down the registration number of the suspect’s vehicle and passed it to the police,” Patil said. “The girl has been admitted to the Sassoon General Hospital for medical examination,” the DCP said, adding that a case under the relevant sections of the IPC and the POCSO Act has been registered. Senior inspector Yashwant Gawari of the Bund Garden police told TOI, “The arrested autorickshaw driver, Sagar Maruti Mandhre (39), is a resident of Katraj.

The court, however, allowed immersion of chemical-free clay idols with a caveat that they be done at the ancient lake near PV Ghat, Sanjivaiah Park and Secretariat areas, but not in the main Tank Bund. Experts welcomed the move and said it would go a long way in reducing pollution of the iconic lake and also ensure that debris do not get piled up in the main lake area. PoP idols cannot be immersed in any of the lakes, except Hussainsagar, in the city and the special ponds built by GHMC for the purpose should be made use for immersing such idols, the court said in a directive. From next year onwards, even making of PoP idols shall not be permitted, the court said. “For this year, they will be allowed to be sold because officials have failed to implement the Central Pollution Control Board norms in this regard and any forcible banning of them at the last minute will adversely affect the livelihoods of poor idol makers,” said a bench of Acting Chief Justice M S Ramachandra Rao and Justice T Vinod Kumar in a contempt case filed by advocate Mamidi Venu Madhav who expressed serious concern over the ill-effects of PoP idols and their immersion in Hussainsagar. Madhav sought action against officials of PCB, GHMC and police for failing to implement the guidelines issued by the high court in this regard. The bench converted the contempt petition into a PIL and after hearing all sides, it came to a conclusion that PCB, GHMC and police were not willing to take a stand in favour of the environment in sensitive matters, particularly where sentiments of the devotees are involved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-hc-bans-pop-idols-immersion-in-hussainsagar/articleshow/86083254.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

Director of IIT-BHU and chairman of official language committee Professor Pramod Kumar Jain said, “The introduction of engineering courses in Hindi will initially start for BTech-I students. However, in the coming years it will be introduced at higher stages as well.” He said that the decision to launch engineering courses in Hindi along with English medium has been taken under the New Education Policy (NEP), which has a provision for making Hindi the medium of instruction. Regarding the landmark move towards making IIT-BHU to be the first institute in India to start engineering studies in Hindi by removing the barrier of language in pursuing technical studies, Prof Jain said, “Use of regional languages will only expand the scope of engineering with talented youths from across the section of society coming forward to pursue technical studies.” “A list of teachers capable of teaching in Hindi is being prepared while books are also being arranged for engineering courses,” he said adding that all necessary preparations including making and provision to call experts from outside to teach engineering courses in Hindi as per the requirement were also being made. Under NEP, in 2020 the Central government had announced its plan to introduce engineering courses in Hindi at the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs). Subsequently, the BHU started working on it, but had to shelve its plan due to Covid-19 pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/iit-bhu-set-to-start-teaching-engineering-courses-in-hindi/articleshow/86080757.cms||---

With BJP on their radar, which union leaders accuse of being anti-farmers, the theme of the panchayats will be to motivate people to teach the ruling party a lesson in the crucial assembly polls due early next year. Upbeat with the good response to its mahapanchayat held in Muzaffarnagar on Sunday, where lakhs of farmers gathered on the call of the BKU and Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), the outfit on Thursday said it will hold panchayats across all the 18 divisions of UP. “Preparation is in full swing. We are planning to hold panchayats in every mandal (division) of Uttar Pradesh. Dates will be fixed soon,” said Dharmender Malik, media in-charge of BKU. Soon after the Muzaffarnagar mahapanchayat, opposition SP and BSP had said that the ground was shifting against the BJP’s politics of hatred. Apart from the small panchayats in villages and towns, there will be meetings at division levels too where Rakesh Tikait and other senior leaders of SKM will address the gatherings, Malik said. Farmers had launched their stir against the three agriculture laws last year, soon after they were enacted. While unions say that they will hurt the interests of the growers in the long run, the government is trying to project them as major reform in the agriculture sector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/bku-plans-stir-beyond-west-up-to-hold-panchayats-across-state/articleshow/86076023.cms||Mohd Dilshad

It found that the paddy in the urn belonged to 1,155 BCE that is 600 years older than the samples found in Keeladi in Sivaganga district where ongoing excavation has been throwing up exciting findings. Historians say that the graffiti found in the Indus Valley civilization and that encountered in south India are about 80% identical. This suggests that there may be some linguistic connection between Indus Valley Civilization, south India and Sri Lanka. The shortest river in the state, the Thamirabarani starts in Pothigai hills of the Western Ghats in the Ambasamudram taluk, flows through Tirunelveli and Thoothukudi districts and empties at Korkai (Tirunelveli district) into the Gulf of Mannar (Bay of Bengal). Stalin said the government would set up a museum at Tirunelveli to showcase rare artefacts found in Adichanallur and Sivagalai in Thoothukudi district and Korkai at a cost of Rs 15crore. “To establish the ancientness of Chera country and culture, the state government will conduct excavations at Chera era port city Musiri (now Pattanam) in Kerala along with local archaeologists. Likewise, studies will be conducted at Vengi in Andhra Pradesh, Talakadu in Karnataka and Palur in Odisha with the help of local archaeologists,” Stalin said, making a suo-motu statement in the assembly. He said the state archaeological department would conduct research in Quseir al-Qadim in Egypt, which was once part of the Roman empire as well as in Khor Rori in Oman, to establish Tamils’ trade relations with these countries. The government would also conduct similar studies in south east Asian countries like Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam (conquered by Tamil king Rajendra Chola) with the help of local archaeologists, he added. “In search of cultural roots of Tamils, we will travel across the world. The government will scientifically establish with evidence that the history of the Indian subcontinent should begin with the Tamil landscape,” said the chief minister. He recalled that the Union government had left the excavation at Keeladi incomplete, prompting the state to continue its initiative. “Further excavation and carbon dating established that Tamils were literate in the sixth century BCE itself. Keeladi has reunited Tamils all over the world and with that spirit, the state archaeological department is now excavating sites at Adichanallur, Sivagalai, Korkai, Kodumanal, Mayiladumparai and Gangaikonda Cholapuram,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/thamirabarani-civilization-3200-years-old-reveals-carbon-dating/articleshow/86080751.cms||---

---||Meerut||35 paper mills in UP may shutdown in 2 weeks due to coal shortage||Meerut: Some 35 paper mills spread across Bijnor, Muzaffarnagar and Meerut that account for almost 80% of UP’s concentration are facing an acute shortage of coal. These mills that clock close to Rs 10,000 crore annual turnover may have to shut down within the next two weeks. These units have their own coal-based power generation plants. Their present predicament is a fallout of the coal ministry’s decision to prioritize the supply of coal for the supercritical sector -- which is thermal power plants that face low stocks. This is affecting the supply to non-power sectors that generate their own power to run plants. On Monday, Paper Manufacturer Association, wrote a letter to the secretary, ministry of coal, stating, “Since last few days, Northern Coalfields Ltd (a subsidiary of Coal India Ltd) has stopped supplies of coal rakes to the non-regulated sector consumers and diverted the entire rail traffic to thermal power plants. We would like to inform you that our member units are producing their own power to run the plants. The coal stock at most of our member's plants is at a very critical level. Some of them have only a few days of stock left. If the coal rakes of our members are not dispatched immediately, they will have to go on shutdowns, resulting in huge losses to them." Sanjeev Jain the secretary of the Association revealed, "There has been no spot auction of coal from Northern Coalfields Ltd in the last 2 months. Further, the exclusive auction of coal for direct consumers has also not been held in this financial year by Northern Coalfields Ltd." Sanjeev Gupta, the owner of a Meerut-based paper mill said, "On an average the capacity of a paper mill here is 250 tonnes of paper per day which requires one rake of coal in a month. One rake of coal comprises 58 railway wagons carrying anywhere between 5,700 to 4,000 tons of coal. Now, the supply is compromised. We have never faced this kind of crisis in the last five years. This time, a huge stock is being diverted to thermal plants and imported coal is not arriving at the ports due to the after-effects of Covid pandemic." Sources revealed dispatches to some thermal power plants were stopped by Coal India Ltd on account of default in payment earlier this year due to which their stocks depleted. Now, the government's focus is to top up the stocks again because of which huge quantities of coal is being diverted to these thermal plants, choking the supply to non-power sectors like aluminium, cement, steel and paper which consumes 25% of the total coal outlay. Speaking with TOI, minister of coal and mines Prahlad Joshi denied stopping coal supply earlier to thermal plants for non-payment of dues. He said, “It's for public utility, how can we stop it? The allegations that now we are diverting all coal to them to fill up the depleting stocks is also wrong. It's just that no off-take of coal was taking place at the quarry level because of heavy rains and flooding of mines. Now, that the rains have subsided, things should begin to improve in a week's time.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/35-paper-mills-in-up-may-shutdown-in-2-weeks-due-to-coal-shortage/articleshow/86076078.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmadabad: Second leopard sighting spooks Sanathal||AHMEDABAD: The second sighting of a leopard in just seven months left residents of Sanathal village, 5km from Shela, scared. On Thursday, the villagers informed the forest department about the incident and also showed them its pug marks. Confirming this, the foresters said that the leopard, which is believed to be a sub-adult, had hunted a nilgai calf. It is believed that the leopard, like the earlier one, had strayed into the area through the ravines alongside the Sabarmati. “We have set up eight cages in the periphery of Sanathal village and are monitoring the site where the leopard made the kill. A team comprising of more than 20 forest personnel have been deployed to keep watch,” said R Sakkira Begum, Deputy Conservator of Forest, Ahmedabad. The deputy conservator of forest said that the leopard disappeared into the shrubs of a nearby field. “Thereafter, the pug marks could not be traced as it got washed away in the rain,” she said. The officials have sent photographs of the pug marks to determine the age of the leopard, which they believe is approximately 3 years old. Sources in the forest department claim that they are not ruling out the possibility of a second leopard too as there seems to be a difference in the pug impressions found at the site. H S Singh, member of India’s National Board for Wildlife, said, “The higher frequency of leopards sightings in nearby cities is a clear sign of their population increase within sanctuaries. This could also be due to reduction of ungulate population like deer and chital.” A senior wildlife expert claimed, “The leopard numbers — 1,395 reported in 2016 — is underplayed. The population is higher and one of its indication is the higher frequency with which leopards are being sighted now.” Two incident of wildlife sightings — one of a hyena in December last year and another of a leopard that was killed in a road accident at Sanathal crossroads on January 31 this year — have been reported. However, in the January incident, the department failed to discover from where the animal had come.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/second-leopard-sighting-spooks-sanathal/articleshow/86080855.cms||---

According to the Pimpri Chinchwad civic officials, the corporator was unhappy about road work in Kasarwadi during the festive season.

It was September 11, 2001. While 60-year-old Velamuri worked as a manager and auditor in the taxation department of the state of New York on the 86th floor of the Twin Towers, his wife Vasantha’s office at the New York State Insurance Fund was not far from it. Hailing from East Godavari in Andhra Pradesh, Velamuri had moved to the US and worked from the Twin Towers for several years. The two planes that crashed into the twin towers on that fateful day silenced many lives. Sankara Velamuri’s was one of them, leaving his shattered wife to soldier on alone. The couple had no kids and even after 20 years, Vasantha continues to live in the same house attached to fading memories. But Velamuri could have saved his life had he turned his back on others. “He was almost on his way out of the building when he went back to help a pregnant woman. He once again went in to help another colleague. Both of them survived, but my uncle could not make it,” recollected Kaladhar Bapu, a businessman in New Jersey. “For anyone wanting to go to the US, he would be a guide, going out of his way to help. It was this nature of being helpful that took his life,” Bapu added. Aged close to 80, Vasantha has been trekking down to the 9/11 memorial every year since, except last year due to the pandemic curbs. “September 11 was his birthday and it turned out to be tragic,” Bapu said. While the 20th anniversary of 9/11 will be commemorated across the US, many who lost their loved ones have been conflicted by the loss, hoping the day passes without an emotional journey down a painful lane||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ap-nri-born-on-sept-11-died-on-9/11-in-twin-towers/articleshow/86083273.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

Almost 99% cases in Telangana in second wave have been of Delta variant, with most of the plus variant reported only in last two months. Also, there were no other newer variants in the state so far, officials said. These 30 patients are from different districts, majority from GHMC limits. While some positive samples were from Shamshabad airport of travellers returning to state, others had no travel history. “While we are seeing cases of Delta Plus variant, it is not a cause of concern. Patients have recovered and doing fine. The rate of infection and symptoms of this sub-lineage is the same as Delta variant,” said Dr G Srinivasa Rao, director of public health. The Delta variant is attacking susceptible populations such as the unvaccinated and those with co-morbidities. “Therefore, there must be no let up in Covid-appropriate behaviour and all should get vaccinated at the earliest,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/30-delta-plus-cases-in-t-since-may/articleshow/86080843.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Mumbai||Save Aarey: Proceedings closed against 29 protesters||MUMBAI: A Borivli magistrate’s court on Wednesday permitted withdrawal of criminal cases against 29 environmental and tribal activists, including students, arrested by the police for allegedly manhandling them when protesting against tree-cutting in Aarey in 2019. The tree-cutting had begun hours after the Bombay high court had, in October 2019, paved the way for clearing a part of Aarey Milk Colony in Goregaon for the Metro car shed project. When the MVA came to power in the state by the end of 2019, CM Uddhav Thackeray had said no tree would be cut in Aarey and ordered withdrawal of cases against the protesters. Before the magistrate, the activists and students finally got a closure with an acquittal order after the public prosecutor filed a report for permission to withdraw its prosecution against all 29. The report said that they had no criminal antecedents, that no one was hurt, many were stude-nts and in public interest, it had no objection to withdrawing the prosecution. As one of the offences was non-bailable, senior counsel Gayatri Singh, on behalf of the activists, said the magistrate is empowered to permit withdrawal even in non-bailable cases, in public interest. She cited SC rulings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/save-aarey-proceedings-closed-against-29-protesters-in-mumbai/articleshow/86082855.cms||Swati Deshpande

Some of the wall paintings at Palayam and PMG show clear signs of damage. A portion of the Mascot Hotel wall mural has been darkened with spots of soot and stains. Visible cracks and overgrowth mar the paintings on the University stadium walls. Besides, paint peels off in some other works have distorted artistic creations. Given the way their works of art have been left to spoil, the artists are less than enthused. “It seems only a few of the murals were selected for renovation. I never received a call to renovate mine. With exposure and time most of these murals look dulled, especially since it has been five years since the first phase,” said Nemom Pushparaj. Two years ago, some miscreants had also stuck posters over a stretch of murals near Palayam which included works by celebrated artists like K G Subramanyan. However, Dr G Ajith Kumar, who curates the project, said the wear and tear was normal and that only the murals badly in need of retouching were taken care of. “After being exposed to elements for five years, you will never get the original brilliance of the paint back. So, we focused only on a few which needed touching up and that was completed earlier this year,” he said. In January, a committee for renovation was formed under the chairmanship of Vattiyoorkavu MLA V K Prasanth and included famed artists such as Kanayi Kunjhiraman, B D Dattan and Tensing Joseph. The Arteria project was launched by the department of tourism in 2015. Secretary of transport Biju Prabhakar, who had pioneered the concept of creating wall paintings, says that art works could be salvaged by small interventions. “Most of the older artworks do not even need paint or touch-up, they only need cleaning. The fact that we have seen little to no vandalism has contributed to the murals lasting longer than the three years we predicted. That speaks of the positive response from the people of Thiruvananthapuram,” Prabhakar said. The city corporation had once intervened to clean some of the paintings made during Arteria phase I after various organisations started to stick posters on top of the paintings. Some acts of vandalism had also been dealt with in the past. However, there have not been any concrete sustained efforts to conserve the paintings made by artists during the first phase of Arteria.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/citys-arteria-wall-paintings-now-in-a-state-of-neglect/articleshow/86078525.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Dwaipayan Maa shutdown||Kolkata: There might finally be some relief for two-wheeler riders taking the Maa flyover. The East traffic guard has decided to block traffic on the flyover every night from 11 pm for six hours in order to allow KMDA to set up wire nettings. This will be the second phase of work by KMDA, the first phase having covered a 25 metre stretch earlier. The protective nets will stop kite threads from entering the carriageways and injuring riders. For now, the cops have agreed to provide the everyday traffic blocks (11 pm-5 am) till September 22. It will be extended, if required. This phase of work will cover flyover stretch lying between Hindu Burial ground and Boat Club covering mainly the Vishwakarma Building area which has emerged as a major trouble spot. The stretch here - along with AJC Bose Road flyover - has witnessed no less than 14 major kite thread-related accidents in the past four months leaving bikers with bruised necks, noses and faces. Local police has also resumed special raids at Karaya, Topsia and Tiljala to nab all those sellers selling Chinese Manja. The twin development comes after the top brass had promised to take up the matter and look for quick resolution during the just concluded Road Safety Week. “We are hoping that the work would begin as early as this weekend or the beginning of next week. We hope KMDA can make some significant progress in the first week itself,” said a senior officer at Lalbazar. The blockade is expected to be timed in accordance with the night restrictions in place in the city, claimed sources. Police has been regularly corresponding with KMDA asking for the safety nets to be set up at the earliest. The last letter in this regard was sent in July by DC (Traffic) Arijit Sinha. Among the major suggestions made to the KMDA by police for the Maa flyover to stop kite thread accidents was to set up wire nettings across the entire flyover stretch (instead of only one accident prone stretch) and increase the wire height considerably to ensure that two-wheeler riders do not manage to fall off the flyover even in case of an accident. The KMDA had earlier taken a pilot project on a stretch of 25 metres (lying near bridge number 4) consisting of vertical poles and three layers of horizontal wires. ‘It has been observed that the pilot project was successful in preventing two-wheeler accidents. We are planning to give a similar proposal for AJC Bose Road flyover,” said an East traffic guard officer. “Under such circumstances, we have also sought two major modifications on how these nets should be put up. We have recommended that additional three layers of wires may be installed to cover the lower portion closer to the railing to stop any chances of riders falling over. Similarly, the iron bars installed to set up the wires may be wrapped with retro-reflectorarn riders, especially in the coming winter season when visibility drops,” said DC (Traffic) Arijit Sinha. The police said the long stretch between Parama Island and the t7-point crossing has become especially dangerous with over 90 percent kite string accidents being reported from there. “We need to act immediately to stop accidents on the main stretch of Maa flyover even if we turn our attention towards the approaches at a later date. The 200 metre areas near 4 number tanks and then again near Topsia Crossing are of paramount importance. We are relieved that KMDA has chosen the most important stretch to carry out the work,” said a local traffic guard officer. Meanwhile, ever since the death of a Watgunge resident on the AJC Bose flyover and the High Court banning all forms of manja use in the city, the cops have taken action in more than 60 odd cases and lodged more than 32 FIRs. “But the fresh case shows that raids have to be increased control the menace,” said a senior detective department officer who had himself led the operations against manja. Bakrahat Road closed for traffic The busy Bakrahat Road that houses several schools, colleges and upcoming housing complexes of the Joka-Thakurpukur belt will be partially shut for traffic to allow the KEIP to carry out some important sewage and drainage related work. According to police, there will be partial closure along the northern side of Bakrahat Road from Diamond Harbour Road crossing to Bacharpara for construction of five shafts in connection with sewerage development work. ""Public Buses route like 75 , SD-8 , Esplanade-Burul along with other bigger buses of schools and complexes and trucks which intend to reach Khalpol from Thakurpukur Bazar (west bound) will travel further south along DH Road close to IIM Calcutta and reach the Ismail Sarani-DH Road Crossing. They will then take a right turn to avail Ismail Sarani and then Bakrahat Road. Those vehicles which intend to reach Thakurpukur Bazar from Khalpole (east bound) will avail Ismail Sarani from Bakrahat Road, then take left turn from Ismail Sarani / DH Road crossing to avail DH Road north bound.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dwaipayan-maa-shutdown/articleshow/86078494.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Vijayawada||20 years on, terror attack still haunts Telugus in the US||VIJAYAWADA: The 9/11 terror attack on twin towers in New York city may have taken place 20 years ago but the trauma it had left continues to haunt the Telugu-Americans and non-resident Telugus (NRTs), who were witness to the biggest-ever terror strike on the American soil. Chagarla Seetha, who was 23 then, recollects the horror of seeing World Trade Centre (WTC) engulfed in smoke, the second plane hitting the building and finally the twin towers collapsing into a heap of rubble. She was in her studio apartment when the terror attack took place and had watched it in horror from her apartment window. “I was a business student at Fordham University back then. The first thing I remember and can never forget is the huge sound after the first plane struck one of the towers. Immediately, my room-mate and I looked out of the window and witnessed the horrific incident that unfolded within minutes after the initial deafening sound,” Seetha told TOI. Seetha, who currently works for a telecom giant in the US, narrates that the entire atmosphere of Manhattan was filled with panic and screams of people. While Seetha was not the only Telugu-American, who witnessed the incident, it is also pertinent to note the tragic story of Vamsi Pendyala, a 30-year-old techie, who died in the American Airlines Flight 11 that crashed into the WTC. On September 11 morning, Vamsi left a voice mail for his wife Prasanna Kalahasthi, who lives in Boston and informed her that he was looking forward to reaching home for lunch. But the flight could not make it back to the West Coast. The couple settled in the US around 10 years prior to the incident after Vamsi, whose origins are in the combined Andhra Pradesh but settled in Rajasthan. The tragic story does not just end at the terror attack. Chandra Kalahasthi, Prasanna’s sister made her way to the US to comfort her sister, who fell into depression and repeatedly played Vamsi’s message on her phone. But, a month after the attack, Prasanna hung herself from an exercise machine leaving a note for Chandra that reads, “I am sorry I am hurting you. I loved Vamsi too much.” “Of course, a lot has changed in 9/11 in terms of security, immigration policy and economy. But, despite a stringent immigration policy in the past 20 years, the Telugu community did flourish significantly primarily due to their hardworking nature and we can be proud of that,” Telugu Association of North America (TANA) president Anjaiah Chowdary Lavu told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/20-yrs-on-terror-attack-still-haunts-telugus-in-the-us/articleshow/86083276.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

In his police complaint, Amit Puri, a resident of Basant Vihar, Kalka said that he received a message about a part-time job opportunity with Amazon on August 20. A WhatsApp number had been given for further inquiries. When he called, the person who answered asked him to invest Rs 200 in Amazon, after which he would be given work. Puri deposited Rs 200 and received a link to start business with Amazon through a Telegram mobile application. He was introduced to a woman named Jessica on Telegram mobile application and she asked him to deposit Rs 5,000 to start business with Amazon. After getting the money, Jessica assigned some orders for purchase to the victim on August 21. “I was surprised to see that the orders, which were worth thousands went up to lakhs in a few minutes. I continuously said I was incapable of paying such an amount and every time, I was assured that once the orders were fulfilled, I could withdraw all the money, including my principal and income on principal amount,” alleged the victim. At last, when the victim said he did not have any more money, the woman identified as Jessica told him to borrow money from relatives or friends and forced him to complete the order, saying that otherwise his older purchase would have been in vain. On August 22, the victim took loan from friends and completed the order, but the order did not stop and he was again asked to pay for orders up to Rs 3.5 lakh. Again, he paid. When asked for more money, he refused to pay more and when he asked for refund, he was disabled from the online chat with Jessica on Telegram application. The victim filed a police complaint alleging that he was duped of Rs 7.5 lakh through different transactions by the online fraudsters. “I lost my job during Covid and was looking for a good business option and lost my hard-earned savings. Now, I am also under debt. Police must take strict action against the accused,” he said.

The government allowed public celebrations with some riders just five days before the festival. With just a day left for installation, the Mandals were busy erecting pandals and decorating them. “Now there is hardly any time left for making elaborate theme-based decoration. The government has imposed several restrictions owing to Covid-19. As such we are going for a simple pandal and minimum decoration. We will focus on performing the rituals,” said Ashok Kulkarni, a member of a ‘Sarvajanika Ganeshotsava Mandal’ in Dharwad. Deepak Gaonkar, a member of the Mandal that installs the Ganesh idol at Sangam Circle said many mandals had dropped the idea of installing idol this year with the uncertainty over the pandemic and government’s restrictions. The ban on processions while bringing the idol to the pandal and also while taking it for immersion and also on cultural programmes has taken the sheen out of celebrations. The administration has also restricted the height of the idol in public places to four feet and those installed at homes to two feet. The government’s move to permit installation of idols in public places has given a new lease of life to idol makers, people engaged in erecting pandals, decorators, sellers of decoration materials, fruits, flowers and other related items as they can earn some money during the festival. “We had lost income considerably during the lockdown and were waiting to recover during the festival. The ban on public celebration had come as a bolt from the blue. Now we feel a little relaxed,” said Mallappa, who sells decorative materials during the festive season. Idol maker and renowned artist Manjunath Hiremath said he had reduced the number of idols he makes this year after learning lessons from last year. This year, the skyrocketing prices of flowers, fruits, decorative materials and other essential commodities has hit the common people. Nevertheless, people thronged Subhas Road, Railway Station Road in Dharwad and Janata Bazar and Durgadbail in Hubballi to purchase materials for the festival. Laxmi Uppar, a flower vendor in Malamaddi said the price of jasmine has shot up from Rs 1,000 per kg to Rs 2,000 per kg while that of marigold and rose has also doubled. Apple is sold at Rs 140 per kg and pomegranates at Rs 150. Anup Ullagaddi, a resident of Rani Channamma Nagar in Dharwad said his family has decided to focus on rituals rather than on decoration in view of Covid-19 and price rise.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/ganesha-mandals-racing-against-time-to-instal-idols/articleshow/86077592.cms||GURURAJ JAMKHANDI

---||Chandigarh||Farmers block roads over compensation for land||Mohali: A large group of farmers blocked roads near the district administrative complex here on Thursday. They were protesting against less compensation given in lieu of land acquired by the government for construction of roads. A number of farmers from across the state joined the protest. Raising slogans against the Punjab government, they demanded compensation at prevailing market rates for the land acquired. With farmers blocking all roads along the administrative complex, commuters headed for the complex had a tough time. There was a traffic jam in Sohana village and surrounding areas as police tried to divert the traffic. Farm leaders Sonia Mann and Dr Karamjit Singh Chilla said that the Central government was acquiring fertile lands for construction of highways and other roads and offering meagre compensation to farmers. They said that the compensation offered should be in line with the market rate and the Punjab government should take up the matter with the Centre. The protesters alleged that the government was only acquiring the land of poor farmers and that no land belonging to any political leader had been acquired. They said this was because maps reached political parties before land was acquired. They said they would not allow anyone to acquire their lands till they were given proper compensation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farmers-block-roads-over-compensation-for-land/articleshow/86078343.cms||---
---||Delhi||After FB alert, police avert suicide bid||New Delhi: After being alerted by Facebook, Delhi Police personnel saved a man, who was allegedly on his way to end his life after posting about it on the social media platform. Coincidentally, this happened on Friday — World Suicide Prevention Day. The cyber cell received a communication from Facebook, Ireland, reporting about a suspicious “suicidal activity” by a Delhi resident. “The details shared by Facebook were analysed and the last location of the person was found to be around Signature Bridge. The SHOs of three neighbouring police stations — Timarpur, Dayalpur and Seelampur — were roped in for the rescue operation,” said an officer. With the technical analysis of Facebook data, the cops were able to reach out to the victim’s brother, who also joined the search around Signature Bridge and finally traced the victim near Khajoori Chowk. Facebook has a mechanism to analyse posts indicating extreme actions, and its officials are in touch with cyber cells in different cities to avert such actions or take suitable steps, police said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/after-fb-alert-police-avert-suicide-bid/articleshow/86101563.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||‘Ahmedabad outskirts may have some big cats’||AHMEDABAD: The pug marks of a leopard found in Sanathal area, the second incident in just less than seven months, has raised concerns about a small leopard population surviving in the ravines of Sabarmati river, or in the nearby forest area. Senior forest officials said that in February they had tracked a leopard up to Sabarmati river and established that it had come close to the city through shrubs and had skirted villages. The leopard pug marks were also spotted near Vanzar, Badrabad and other villages. A big cat expert said that the leopard that had died was an adult, and the fresh pug marks also appear to be those of an adult leopard. Forest officials said a stable population near Ahmedabad could be bringing the animals to the city. In the past too, it was established that leopards were coming to Gandhinagar from Sabarkantha following the Sabarmati river. R Sakkira Begum, deputy conservator of forest, Ahmedabad said, “It is unlikely that a leopard habitat has come up near Ahmedabad. What we are witnessing are scattered encounters of leopards. We keep monitoring animals for a repeat pattern, but it is not that. Some of them stray for finding food and are seen on outskirts but they disappear, never to be sighted again. These are stray incidents.” Bharat Pathak, a former IFS officer who was posted in Gir for long said, “In the past, a leopard habitat was found in an abandoned factory building on the outskirts of Ahmedabad. Also, some waste land or forest land in the vicinity could have a low-density population from where these leopards are coming to the city.” He said that leopards survive on small animals and even poultry and stray dogs. A senior officer said all the possible wildlife routes to Ahmedabad need to be scanned to find from where the animal had come to the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/city-outskirts-may-have-some-big-cats/articleshow/86080911.cms||---
---||Delhi||Winter is coming: Battle mode to tackle Delhi's bad air||NEW DELHI: Officials from Delhi Pollution Control Committee, the environment department and the forest department on Thursday met Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai to table the draft winter action plan.  The minister, who held a press conference later, said 10 key focus areas had been identified for the action plan and a review meeting was to be held on September 14 to look at preparedness for the winter. The plan is expected to be ready by September 30. Rai said the plan would act as a catalyst in the Delhi government’s fight against pollution and would help look at various sectors that contribute to Delhi’s pollution. “The Kejriwal government, with the support of the people of Delhi, is taking concrete steps to tackle rising pollution levels. In this prospect, we have started preparations for a winter action plan. A high-level review meeting was held with Delhi Pollution Control Committee, environment department, development department and forest department officials. The principal focus of this meeting was to lay an outline for the winter action plan. We drafted an outline keeping in mind the areas that require the prime focus of the government.” Rai said on Thursday. The ten key focus areas identified include pollution from stubble burning, vehicular pollution, dust pollution, open-waste burning, pollution hotspots in Delhi and better coordination through the existing war room on pollution and the Green Delhi app. “Stubble burning pollution, vehicular pollution, dust pollution and waste burning contribute immensely to the rising pollution levels. These issues have been included as the first four points of focus for the plan,” Rai further said, stating the government will also work upon pollution hotspots. “The Kejriwal government has established smog towers at certain hotspots as a pilot project. We will study the performance of these towers and accordingly establish more towers wherever required,” he added. The environment minister said another area of concern was inter-state coordination, with discussions to be held with other states for improvement of air quality across NCR. “The problem of pollution is not limited to Delhi alone. Experts have ruled that this is an airshed issue. However, administrators of our neighbouring states do not consider it to be a reason for pollution. The airshed of north India impacts pollution levels immensely. If there’s a bump in pollution levels in Ghaziabad, it will naturally impact Delhi as well. Similarly, if something happens in Haryana, Rajasthan or UP, that, too, will impact Delhi. A team will hence be put together that will hold discussions with the neighbouring states of Delhi and discuss solutions with them,” Rai said, adding that the war room on pollution will be made more advanced. “The Green Delhi app will also be updated,” he stated.  On Tuesday, DPCC had collected feedback from experts and other stakeholders on improving the draft action plan. Suggestions provided also included distribution of heaters to construction workers and guards in winters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/winter-is-coming-battle-mode-to-tackle-bad-air/articleshow/86080941.cms||---

Mufeeda Thesni, president of the disbanded state committee, said in a newspaper article on Thursday that it is unfortunate that even in the 21st century; men are masters while women are labourers in the state’s political realm. IUML had disbanded the state committee of Haritha, which had raised allegations against three male MSF leaders of making anti-women and sexually-coloured remarks against their leaders. The party dissolved the committee saying that it had committed ‘gross indiscipline’ apparently over the refusal shown by Haritha leaders to comply with the party directive to withdraw the complaint they had lodged with the women’s commission against three MSF leaders, including state president PK Navas. Mufeeda said that approaching the commission with the complaint was their constitutional right and there was no indiscipline involved. Mufeeda said that she came to know about the disbanding of the committee through media and added that Kerala society has started discussing the right and wrongs of the decision. “We reacted when our self-respect was hurt. We expected justice. Our fight was not against the ideology of Muslim League or its policies and it was not over granting of organizational rights,” she said, adding that they had expected that the party leadership will view the anti-women remarks and personal accusations seriously. Mufeeda added that even now they hold the belief that ‘the flag they held was not wrong’. “Keeping up that hope, we will continue our fight against those who insult women. If we fail to point out a wrong we will be burdened by a feeling of guilt,” she added. “Always women are viewed as bodies ordained to toil for the revival of political parties and political utilization. The trend of denying women representation in decision-making bodies and policy formulation cannot be accepted. All mainstream political organizations have an anti-women attitude ingrained in them,” she said. She said that even while functioning as the women's wing of MSF, Haritha upheld its dignified existence during the last 1o years. The outfit aimed not only to foster political consciousness among girls but make them capable of resisting the threats against womanhood and humanism, she said. Mufeeda said that around 70-80% of students in higher education institutions in state are girls and Haritha has been acting as a platform to engage and talk about politics with the new generation who are educated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/harithas-ex-president-vows-to-continue-fight/articleshow/86078461.cms||---

According to railway officials, the division surpassed the freight loading target for this year by 3.2% as they recorded Rs 954.6 crore in the first quarter. The revenue generated so far is 10.3% more than the corresponding period last year. Around 9.024 million tonnes of commodities, with coal and fertilisers occupying the lion’s share, were loaded from the Vijayawada division. Railway officials said they have shifted their focus and dependency on coal traffic as the recently formed Business Development Units (BDU) at field and divisional level was successful in capturing several new commodities. “New commodities like degummed soya oil, fly ash bricks and fish feed were captured during the year. Also, there is a tremendous rise in container traffic at Bikkavolu, Kakinada and Samalkot stations. Recently, lift on lift-off services were launched at Bikkavollu which proved a huge success,” officials said. Studying the business pattern, officials pointed out that freight customers are keenly interested in offering container traffic and proposals are in place to execute it. There is a tremendous surge in limestone loading at Krishnapatnam port where daily three rakes of limestone are being handled. Demand for limestone, which is a key raw material used in steel plant, has shot up with the revival of industrial activity. In the current year, 268 rakes of limestone were loaded at Krishnapatnam port, recording Rs 87.03 crore in earnings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/vij-rly-division-surpasses-freight-loading-target-by-3-2/articleshow/86078485.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

With this, 68 close contacts of the boy have tested negative for the infection so far. Health minister Veena George told the media in Thiruvananthapuram that all tests conducted today were held at the lab set up in Kozhikode government medical college hospital. She said currently there were 274 persons in the contact list of the boy, of which 149 were health workers. Only seven persons in the contact list were symptomatic and they had only mild symptoms like fever and headache. As many as 47 persons in the list were from other districts. George said that the house-to-house survey in the containment zone, declared in a 3km radius around the boy’s home, has been completed and no instances of unnatural fever or unnatural deaths have been reported; which was a positive development. “As many as 89 persons had fever and related symptoms but none of them are epidemiologically linked to the boy. However, two mobile labs have been pressed in to facilitate their tests for Covid and Nipah,” she said Meanwhile, a team from National Institute of Virology, Pune along with officials of forest department and animal husbandry department (AHD) surveyed the bat habitats around the two Rambutan trees located near the house of the boy at Pazhoor. “We identified two bat colonies from where live bat samples would be collected. The exercise is likely to be conducted tomorrow after the equipment needed to trap bats and sample collection –which are being brought by road – arrive,” said an official with AHD. Meanwhile, various samples collected by ADH were sent to National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases laboratory in Bhopal on Thursday. AHD had collected samples of Rambutan fruits from the vicinity, arecanuts suspected to be bitten by bats, bat droppings and dead bats. Also samples from around 23 goats in the locality were also collected by AHD for testing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/nipah-22-more-contacts-test-ve/articleshow/86078503.cms||---

The award has recognised Icrisat for its Tropical Legumes Projects (TLP) carried out between 2007 and 2019 in phases across the African continent as well as India and Bangladesh. As part of these projects, Icrisat, along with its partners, developed high-yielding and climate-resilient food legume varieties. These seeds belonged to chickpea, common bean, cowpea, groundnut, pigeonpea and soybean. Icrisat’s deputy director general, Dr Arvind Kumar, said production of these seed was taken up on a large scale and made available to a large number of households. By growing improved varieties, farm households were able to increase their legume crop yields and incomes, he said. Over the years, they worked towards training scientists, next generation of crop breeders and trained local seed producers. The Tropical Legumes Projects was funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/icrisat-helping-africa-farm-itself-out-of-poverty-food-crisis/articleshow/86080928.cms||Swati Rathor

The petitioner has a legitimate right to expect palliative care and nursing,’’ said Justices S S Shinde and Nijamoodin on the petition of Gadchiroli IED blast accused Uppuganti, 60. The judges took note of a report of a panel of Tata Memorial Hospital (TMH) that Uppuganti was diagnosed with cancer in 2018 and has been receiving treatment from TMH for breast cancer since September 2019. She is terminally ill since the cancer has metastasised to her liver, bones, lungs, probably leptomeninges, and afflicted her brain as well. While prosecutor, Sangeeta Shinde, said prison staff and inmates are taking care of Uppuganti, the judges agreed with her advocate, Payoshi Roy, that “specialised care and treatment, which the petitioner requires at this stage can only be provided by the trained and professional medical care providers.” The judges directed the authorities to shift Uppuganti to Shanti Avedna latest by September 15, to take her to TMH as and when advised by doctors and allow her to speak to her husband Satyanarayan Rani, a co-accused lodged at Arthur Road prison.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-orders-shifting-of-terminally-ill-naxal-to-hospice/articleshow/86082967.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||Agra||1500-year-old temple remains found in Uttar Pradesh||AGRA: The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has found during routine scrubbing the remains of an ancient temple that dates back to the 5th century CE, the Gupta period, at Bilsarh village in UP’s Etah. The staircase, excavated last month, has Shankhalipi inscriptions which the ASI has now confirmed say ‘Sri Mahendraditya’, the title of the Gupta ruler Kumaragupta I who ruled over what is now north-central India for 40 years in the 5th century CE. Bilsarh has been protected since 1928 and was known as an important Gupta period site. “There were two decorative pillars (at the spot) close to one another, with human figurines (found earlier). To understand their significance, we conducted further excavation and found the stairs,” said Vasant Swarnkar, superintending archaeologist of ASI’s Agra circle. “We found something written on it in Shankhalipi. It was deciphered as saying ‘Sri Mahendraditya’, which was the title of Kumaragupta I of the Gupta dynasty.” Shankhalipi is an ornate, stylised, ancient script, used between the 4th and 8th centuries CE for names and signatures. The discovery came about during a “routine” clean-up. Around every monsoon, the ASI starts scrubbing its protected sites. There’s a lot of overgrowth to get rid of. This time, Swarnkar said, he was monitoring the cleaning when he thought the spot should be excavated and the ASI stumbled upon ancient stairs leading to a temple. The inscription found on the Etah remains had earlier been seen on a horse statue found in Lakhimpur Kheri. It is now at the State Museum, Lucknow. But that was not confirmation enough. So, Swarnkar sent images of the inscriptions to noted epigraphist Dr Devendra Handa. At the same time, ASI officials visited Lucknow to go over the horse statue inscription again. Both confirmed it was indeed Shankhalipi. Because the inscription names Kumaragupta I, the remains were dated back to his reign. The Etah remains are only the third structural temple of the Gupta period found so far. “The Guptas were the first to build structural temples for Brahminical, Buddhist and Jain followers. Prior to that, only rock-cut temples were built,” said Prof Manvendra Pundhir from the Aligarh Muslim University’s history department. “Before this, only two structural temples were found — Dashavatara Temple in Deogarh and Bhitargaon Temple in Kanpur Dehat. The Etah pillars are well-sculpted, better than the earlier examples in which only the lower sections were carved. The decorative pillars and staircase are a bit more advanced than the earlier ones.” The ASI will now conserve the remains, put up a shed and a descriptive signboard for visitors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/remains-of-1500-yr-old-temple-with-shankhalipi-words-found-in-routine-cleaning/articleshow/86076168.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Ahmedabad||No charging station in Ahmedabad, electric vehicle dreams lose power||AHMEDABAD: If you were determined to go green this Dussehra by buying an electric vehicle, you may have to unplug that dream for now. The city is yet to operationalize public charging stations. The civic body’s recent announcement of waiving vehicle tax for private electric vehicles is practically unfeasible if only a handful of charging stations serve the idea. For now, AMC is still installing public charging stations at three places — Navrangpura multi-level parking, Kankaria Kids City and Kankaria Gate number 2. The civic body has already received a budget from the union government for the purpose. The Centre has sanctioned as many as 278 electric vehicle charging stations in three cities of Gujarat including Ahmedabad, Vadodara and Gandhinagar under the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles, India scheme phase II (FAME2). Most of these sanctioned EV charging stations are yet to be operationalized for the public. While declaring Gujarat Electric Vehicle Policy 2021 in June this year, Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani had announced a capital subsidy of 25% up to Rs 10 lakh to set up these charging stations. However, not a single station has come up in the city. The AMC’s electric department had located many sites in the city almost a year ago but the work has not yet begun. In March this year, Prakash Javdekar, the then union minister of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises, had given a list of charging stations set up in the country under FAME2. The list mentions that a total of 386 charging stations have come up under FAME2. Rajasthan has set up 94 charging stations, and small states like Jharkhand has set up 24 EV charging stations. The list does not mention Gujarat. “We will shortly operationalize EV charging stations,” an AMC official said. According to experts, giving subsidies and waving off tax for EV vehicles will make no difference if there is no infrastructure in place for charging. “For any vehicular technological transfer, support infrastructure is very crucial. EV charging stations should become a part of the street design itself. Pune has amended their street design guidelines to incorporate the same. Ahmedabad should follow such practices,” said Rutul Joshi, Associate Professor, CEPT University. Joshi is an expert on urban transport.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/no-charging-station-ev-dreams-lose-power/articleshow/86081019.cms||Soumitra Trivedi

Opposition student organizations KSU and MSF staged protests before the varsity on Thursday demanding removal of the books from the syllabus and terming it as a hidden attempt to “saffronize” education. The books by Hindutva mascots are included in the syllabus of third semester core course ‘Themes in Indian Politics’ of the MA Governance and Politics course. The course, which is offered only in Brennen College, Thalassery, under the varsity, is one of the newly-sanctioned courses in the varsity, which commenced in November last year. The syllabus was revised last month on the basis of suggestions by an expert committee which replaced the core paper ‘Contemporary Political Theory’ with ‘Themes in Indian Politics’. The new syllabus has extracts from books such as “Hindutva: Who is a Hindu? (V D Savarkar), “We or Our Nationhood Defined” (M S Golwalkar: Chapter- II, III, and IV extracts), “Bunch of Thoughts” (M S Golwalkar) and “Integral Humanism” (Deendayal Upadhyaya). Kannur University vice chancellor Prof Gopinath Ravindran brushed away allegations of “saffronization”. “I don’t know the basis of the controversy as no one who has read the syllabus fully would have raised the allegation,” he said adding that there are many books in the syllabus which can be considered as against the concept of Hindutva like “Nationalism” by Rabindranath Tagore, “Is Hatred Essential for Nationalism” by Mahatma Gandhi, “Nationalism and Internationalism and what is Culture” by Jawaharlal Nehru and “Who Constitutes a Nation” by B R Amdebkar, in the syllabus. “I think it is wrong to say that books of Golwalkar or Savarkar, which are the foundational text for the current politics, should not be included for reading. Only by reading their writings can we understand what their views were and the problems in it. I think Golwalkar and Savarkar should be made essential readings in the current times. People will be frightened if they read what is contained in their books. We have to first have understanding of a thing if we have to support or oppose an idea,” the vice chancellor said. The vice chancellor pointed out that books like “Is there an Indian way of thinking” by A K Ramanujan”, “Argumentative Indian” by Amartya Sen, “Why I am not an Hindu” by Kancha Ilaiah, “Ramayana and Political Imagination in India” by Sheldon Pollock and “Lokayata” by D P Chattopadhyaya, are also part of the syllabus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/row-over-entry-of-rss-ideologues-in-syllabus/articleshow/86078538.cms||---

On Thursday, seven new cases were reported from over 4,000 tests. City doctors said with high number of vaccinations and herd immunity, there is now a thin line between Covid19 disease and the seasonal flu. As vaccination helps in cutting the severity of the Covid19, even positive patients admitted at hospitals are not needing much of oxygen support or lung involvement. Pulmonologist Dr Ashok Arbat, director of KRIMS hospital, said cases of viral fever are similar like they used to happen before Covid. “We don’t know the exact which virus maybe responsible for the illness,” he said. As per protocol, doctors are recommending RTPCR tests for patients with high fever. Once Covid test is negative, the patients are being tested for dengue — which is widespread — and scrub typhus but these too are found negative. Dr Arbat added that even those admitted have mild CT (lung) changes. “We have Covid patients who have been vaccinated but they are mild cases,” he said. Doctors said this is the case with many vaccinated patients. Dr Rajesh Swarnakar, chief pulmonologist and director of Getwell Hospital, said, “We call it acute coryza where patients have cough, cold and fever. There is a thin line between Covid and flu now,” he said. Dr Swarnakar added that as per a study on vaccinated healthcare workers, a few needed oxygen support and mortality was zero. “Eventually, with fully protected population, Covid may become like a mild flu,” he said. Dr Vikram Rathi, consultant pulmonologist at Kingsway Hospital, said right now Covid cases are scattered. “Hence vaccination will make an impact as our region’s achievement is good. Cases are gradually increased. So even if the projected third wave comes, it will be much milder. Not just the novel corona virus, there are other viruses too due to seasonal changes. Many times there is a very thin line between mild Covid and other viral infections,” he said. GMCH medical superintendent Dr Avinash Gawande said daily change in weather causes swift drift in viral fever cases. “Patients have no other symptoms than headache or abdomen pain. But investigation is necessary for complete evaluation. High fever cases are referred as acute febrile illness,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/thin-line-between-covid-and-flu-symptomatic-vaxxed-patients-testing-ve/articleshow/86080968.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Abhishek Hait was into business and he was in deep financial stress. His wife of two years had left him and moved to her parents’ house because Hait was in debt and the family was going through a crisis. This morning, when he was having a fight with his mother Krishna over the crisis, he lost his temper and picked up a starp and heavy object and started stabbing his mother, till she fell unconscious in a pool of blood. After this he cut his veins and started bleeding profusely. The screams alerted locals who entered their home and found the two lying unconscious. They were rushed to Howrah General Hospital where Krishna was declared dead. Abhishek too succumbed after a couple of hours. Police has started investigating and questioning the neighbours. Most have confirmed that the family was neck deep in debt and so Abhishek’s wife had left him recently. The mother and son would constantly fight about the huge debt that the youth had incurred during these Covid months. On Thursday morning things came to a head when Abhishek turned violent, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/youth-commits-suicide-after-killing-mother/articleshow/86078644.cms||Rupak Banerjee
---||Kochi||No more colonial words: Kerala HC to cops||KOCHI: Words such as ‘eda’, ‘edi’ and ‘nee’, which are used by police against the public routinely, are the relics of colonial ‘subjugatory’ tactics and are impermissible, the Kerala high court has declared. Such a declaration was made by Justice Devan Ramachandran in an order issued on a petition filed by Anil JS of Cherpu in Thrissur alleging that Cherpu sub inspector verbally abused his daughter while enforcing Covid-19 protocol. In the order, the court said, “It may not require this court to speak with great elaboration or expatiation when I say that the afore words, if used to address citizens by police officers, is anathema to a civilized and cultured force and are the relic of the colonial subjugatory tactics. Certainly, they have no place in a free country marching in pace with needs and requirements of the 21st century.” “Use of these and such other words to address citizens by any police officer is wholly impermissible and therefore, it is now imperative for this court to declare that such use by any member of the force is contrary to the constitutional morality and conscience of our country and is antipodean to the ethos of a democratic system…,” the court said. Even though a circular was issued by the state police chief on November 30, 2018 directing police officers to use decent language, complaints of rude behaviour and improper address by police officers are still reaching the high court regularly, the court pointed out. “Since this court is now certain that use of disrespectful words to address the citizens cannot be tolerated or permitted, I direct the state police chief to issue necessary instructions, by way of a circular or otherwise, to all members of the force under his command that they shall address the citizens using acceptable vocatives and shall not use the aforementioned or such other words or phrases,” the court ordered while asking the state police chief to remind police officials of their obligation once again. The court will consider the action-taken report in this regard after two weeks, the order said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/no-more-eda-edi-nee-hc-tells-police/articleshow/86078617.cms||---

As per the plan, laser shows are planned to be screened on the dam wall surface. Recently, power minister K Krishnankutty and water resource minister Roshy Augustine had discussed the project. KSEB hydel tourism director Sreekumar G said that the ministerial-level talks were successful and the hydel tourism wing is moving ahead with the project. “To implement the project, we need to rehabilitate 84 families living under the dam area to Silon Colony. For the rehabilitation project, we had identified nearly eight acres of land,” said former KSEB hydel tourism director K J Jose. “The initial cost of the project was Rs 30 crore and we are planning to implement the project under the Kerala infrastructure investment fund board,” he said. Laser shows depicting the history of the dam and KSEB will be presented on the wall of the arch dam, which is 500 foot high and 400 foot wide. Seating facility for 600 to 700 people would be arranged in an amphitheatre-style in the downstream of the dam, said the official. Idukki arch dam is considered as Asia’s largest arch dam and the project was commissioned in 1973. The dam is 169 meter high and 366 meter long at the top, said the official. Besides laser shows, the hydel tourism wing is also planning to set up a parking space and an aquarium with toughened glass in the area in front of the arch dam. People could walk on the glass and enjoy the scenic beauty, said Jose. According to officials, the laser show project will provide an extra push to the tourism sector in Idukki. “Idukki-Cheruthoni dams have emerged as one of the major tourist destinations in Idukki. The proposed project will attract more tourists to Idukki,” said a tourism department official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kseb-to-go-ahead-with-laser-show-project/articleshow/86078563.cms||Sandeep Thomas

Four of them are girls and one boy. The girls are hostelites and have been shifted to the college’s Shalinitai Meghe Hospital and Research Centre (SMHRC) on the same campus. DMMC had tested 100 students at the SMHRC, and advised 50 day scholars living in Nagpur city to also get tested after 11 of their batchmates tested positive early this week. Among the 16 infected students, two are day scholars from Narendra Nagar and Phulwati Nagar. A decision on their institutional quarantine would be taken by Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). Dean Dr Dilip Gode told TOI that all the students are doing well and mostly asymptomatic. According to the Nagpur district civil surgeon’s data on Thursday, seven positive cases were detected including two from rural, four from city and one from outside the district. Not all results of the MBBS students appear to have been included in the Thursday tally, which reflects results received till 12noon. Three more patients were shifted to MLA Covid Care Centre by NMC. Now, it has 11 patients while it has transferred mild symptomatic cases to AIIMS Nagpur. DMMC is likely to conduct RTPCR tests again of all the students five days after the first round.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/5-more-vaxxed-mbbs-students-test-positive/articleshow/86078575.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

The city has over 10,000 small and big apartments. Most of them are located in Madhurawada, Kurmanapalem, Pendurthi and a few other areas. BB Ganesh, general secretary of Visakhapatnam apartment residents welfare association (VARWA), said less than two per cent of apartment complexes in the city will celebrate Chaturthi this year due to fears over the third wave of Covid-19. “Moreover, many people and their families have been affected badly by the second wave. Many of them have lost one or more of their relatives,” said Ganesh, adding that they have requested those who are celebrating the festival in their apartments to follow Covid protocol. The situation is a little different in Vijayawada, where the sale of Ganpati idols saw a sudden spurt, thanks to the high court’s order permitting pandals at private places. The artisans, however, are offering huge discounts on the idols to clear stocks. Big rush of buyers was witnessed at stalls selling idols at Nunna Mango market on Thursday. “Barring last year, we have been celebrating Vinayaka Chaturthi at our apartment for the past 12 years. We are thankful to the HC for permitting the celebrations,” said K Nagendra, a resident of Bhavanipuram.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/vij-sees-ganpati-rush-but-spirit-dull-in-vizag/articleshow/86078551.cms||Nalla.Babu
---||Delhi||Delhi: New courses to dilute JNU’s PG research, claim teachers||NEW DELHI: Jawaharlal Nehru University will soon offer a four-year integrated Bachelor of Education degree and five-year integrated BA-LLB degree after implementing the new National Education Policy. According to JNU Teachers’ Association, these were approved at the 296th Executive Council meeting of the university on September 2 and were meant to “destroy the postgraduate research character of the university”. JNU also plans to set up the new Centre for Mentoring, Centre for Vocational Studies, Centre for Professional and Career Counselling, Centre for Artificial Intelligence and create the School of Mathematical Sciences, School of Chemical Sciences and Pharmaceuticals and the School of Library and Information Sciences. The teachers’ body said in a statement on Thursday that the EC also decided to upgrade Zakir Husain Centre for Educational Studies to the School for Education and Planning and Management offering a 4-year BEd course and similarly upgrade Centre for the Study of Law and Governance to the School of Law and Governance with a 5-year integrated BA-LLB degree. “Clearly, the directive is to destroy the postgraduate research character of the university,” maintained JNUTA. As for the EC approving the establishment of a medical school and a super specialty hospital, JNUTA said it was important to note that the agenda for the EC meeting did not have the matter related to the medical school-cum-hospital and that item 6.23 of the circulated agenda specifically sought EC’s approval for the cancellation of the August 17, 1998 EC resolution on the establishment of the BC Roy Super Specialty Hospital and Medical Centre on the JNU Campus. Alleging that the land earmarked for the hospital was going to be transferred to the engineering centre, JNUTA condemned “the devious manner in which approval of the earmarked land for one project 23 years ago is sought to be transferred to another through a false recording of the minutes”. It added that JNU was located in a legally protected green zone where mass construction was forbidden. “Given this, it is a moot question as to how the VC seeks to justify future expansion of the university when he is still struggling to get necessary permission for the construction of existing schools,” the statement said. According to JNUTA, the total annual expenditure for 2020-21 fell by almost 21%, with grants in aid received reducing by nearly Rs 42 crore from 2019-20. "The expenditure on academic expenses also fell by Rs 8 crore and labour charges by Rs 6 crore, accounting for over 72% of the total decline in regular expenditure of the university in 2020-21,” the statement said. “Financial expenses related to legal charges, on the other hand, witnessed an increase from Rs 3.5 lakh in 2019- 20 to over Rs 20 lakhs in 2020-21. This increase, it may be pointed out, is due to multiple illegal decisions of the vice-chancellor and his administration being challenged in courts of law.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/new-courses-to-dilute-jnus-pg-research-claim-teachers/articleshow/86081059.cms||---

Fort police arrested Sajeev alias Chathan Sajeev, 38, of Padassery near Attukal and Jayashankar alias Tile Kannan, 38, of Nedumcaud, for murdering Satheesh of Bund Road near Irumpupalam. The alleged crime took place on Wednesday around 8.30 pm at an automobile workshop at Bund Road. The two men, who came in an auto rickshaw, attacked Satheesh and stabbed him twice in the chest. Though he was rushed to hospital by his friends he succumbed to his injuries. The two accused escaped in the same rickshaw. However, they were caught later in the night when they turned up at the general hospital in the city to nurse the wounds they sustained during the scuffle. Fort station house officer inspector J Rakesh said personal rivalry was behind the attack. He said the victim was a regular visitor of the workshop where the crime was committed. A few days ago, the two accused had assaulted a staff member of the workshop. Later, Satheesh confronted the duo and told them not to enter Irumpupalam region again. This is suspected to be the reason behind the attack.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/two-held-for-murder/articleshow/86078650.cms||---

When she came home to a rousing welcome, the gram panchayat thought they had to do more to honour her and create a legacy. So now, at the remote village of Badalu, every household will put up nameplates with their youngest daughter’s name on it. “We decided that the best way to honour Nikita and inspire other girls would be to have the name of the youngest girl in the household on the nameplate of the house,” said Mahesh Joshi, a member of the gram sabha. “This will also support the government’s Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao programme.” Home to about 150 families, Badalu is 16 km from Pithoragarh on the way to the Dhulagarh Nepal border. Nikita came home this week. The air has been one of celebration since then. “Nikita has made us proud. We want all our girls to do the same,” said Bhagwan Chand, her uncle. “Her achievement is an inspiration. All of us girls here want to follow in her footsteps,” said Darshan Joshi, a Class VII student. Nikita is a Class X student at the local school. She was just 10 when she was spotted by a retired Army personnel, Brijendra Malla, who had started his own boxing academy. “I had retired in 2004. I got Nikita to train here when she was 10, in 2016,” said Malla. That year, she contested at the district level and in 2018, participated in the sub-junior state-level championship in Haridwar. The following year, she took part in the state sub-junior championship at Betalghat in Nainital and won a gold. She played a national-level school game in Delhi that year and in 2020, went to Khelo India in Guwahati, Assam.  “That year, she took part in the state trials at Almora and the national trials as well. She picked up gold in both. It was after the national trials that she was selected for the Dubai event,” Malla added. But this, Nikita said, only marks the beginning of what she wants to do. She added, “Next up, I want to play the senior and youth championships. Eventually, I want to get to the Olympics and get my country a gold."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/girl-champ-at-asian-jr-boxing-village-nameplates-to-have-betis-name/articleshow/86076317.cms||Prem Punetha

But it was not to be. It was September 11, 2001. While 60-year-old Velamuri worked as a manager and auditor in the taxation department of the state of New York on the 86th floor of the Twin Towers, his wife Vasantha’s office at the New York State Insurance Fund was not far from it. Hailing from East Godavari in Andhra Pradesh, Velamuri had moved to the US and worked from the Twin Towers for several years. The two planes that crashed into the twin towers on that fateful day silenced many lives. Sankara Velamuri’s was one of them, leaving his shattered wife to soldier on alone. The couple had no kids and even after 20 years, Vasantha continues to live in the same house attached to fading memories. But Velamuri could have saved his life had he turned his back on others. “He was almost on his way out of the building when he went back to help a pregnant woman. He once again went in to help another colleague. Both of them survived, but my uncle could not make it,” recollected Kaladhar Bapu, a businessman in New Jersey. “For anyone wanting to go to the US, he would be a guide, going out of his way to help. It was this nature of being helpful that took his life,” Bapu added. Aged close to 80, Vasantha has been trekking down to the 9/11 memorial every year since, except last year due to the pandemic curbs. “September 11 was his birthday and it turned out to be tragic,” Bapu said. While the 20th anniversary of 9/11 will be commemorated across the US, many who lost their loved ones have been conflicted by the loss, hoping the day passes without an emotional journey down a painful lane.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ap-nri-was-born-on-sept-11-died-on-9/11-in-twin-towers/articleshow/86078653.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

On Tuesday night, the burglars followed Jayachandran, 45, who is running a private chit firm at Kundara, as he was returning home after the daily collection from his customers to home. The five member gang clad in black clothes and masks soon broke into his house at Madankavu, Mundanchira, Mammoodu, Chandnathopu. They increased the volume of the television set in the house and gagged Jayachandran and his sister Ambili, 54, before making away with the gold and money. As they started beating up Jacyachandran, Ambili gave them Rs. 1,96,000 kept in the house. But they also ransacked the cupboards and took away 19 sovereigns of gold also. Later, they tied down both, locked the house and threw away the keys outside. They also sprinkled chilli powder apparently to make it impossible for the sniffer dogs to identify and track them. Ambily managed to get outside through the kitchen door and telephoned the police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/no-breakthrough-yet-in-robbery-case/articleshow/86078735.cms||---

---||Kanpur||IIT-K, IIT-Madras conduct study to help reduce lead pollution||Kanpur: The Indian Institute of Technology- Kanpur and Indian Institute of Technology- Madras researchers are conducting a study to find out the appropriate policy instruments to help India reduce lead pollution. They are collectively looking at the problem of lead recycling as it can harm mental and physical health of people and pollute environment. While recycling lead in an informal setting, the workers break the lead-acid batteries in a way causing spillage of acid and lead dust in soil and surroundings. Also, lead is melted in open furnaces polluting air. This way of lead recycling is not only harmful to environment but also to health of workers engaged in the recycling process. However, many opt for this process due to low cost. The study suggested that the policy guidelines like reducing tax on regulated recycling sector and providing subsidies to regulated recycling and re-manufacturing sectors reduce lead pollution from lead-acid battery recycling. Another important finding was that a very high subsidy to the formal re-manufacturing sector can lead to the shutting down of both regulated and unregulated recycling sectors. The research team includes Dr R K Amit, professor department of management studies, IIT Madras and an alumnus of IIT Kanpur, Dr B Vipin, assistant professor, department of Industrial & Management Engineering IIT-K, Dr Janakarajan Ramkumar, professor, department of Mechanical Engineering, IIT-K, and Brahmesh Vinayak Joshi from IIT-K. The team published the results of their work in the esteemed international research journal Resources, Conservation and Recycling. According to Dr Vipin and Prof Ramkumar, “The current lead-acid battery recycling in India is a complex process involving competition between organised and unorganised sectors, with unorganized recyclers having a major market share. As unorganized sector does not pay much attention to the legislations and regulations, the lead emissions are high. In this context, we model the system and analyse the impact of economic policy instruments on lead-acid battery recycling in India to reduce the lead emissions.” Prof R K Amit said, “The insufficiency of primary lead sources to satisfy the demand makes the recycling of used batteries necessary. However, the unscientific way of recycling poses serious environmental and health threats. We studied to quantitatively assess the impact of different policy instruments on shifting the recycling business from unorganized to the organized sector.” IIT stated that a report by UNICEF titled ‘The Toxic Truth: Children’s exposure to lead pollution undermines a generation of potential’ estimated that approximately a third of the world’s children, including 27.5 crores of Indian children, have higher exposure to lead as their blood lead levels have 5 micrograms per decilitre or more - levels which are hazardous to their health. Though high lead levels are equally harmful to grown-ups, the high levels of lead in children are known to reduce IQ, decrease attention span, cause anaemia, kidney and liver disorders, among other issues in children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/iit-k-iit-madras-conduct-study-to-help-reduce-lead-pollution/articleshow/86040019.cms||---

On Wednesday, SK Singh (56) was beaten up by guards after he allegedly slapped one of them for refusing to give him the keys to a junction box without permission from the housing society’s facility management. In some videos of the incident, Singh is seen being assaulted by a group of guards with sticks. So far, Amlesh Rai, the security in-charge of the housing society, and guards Vikrant Tomar, Pawan Kumar, Dinesh Kumar, Javed Alam, Pankaj Tiwari, Kushal Paliwal and Krishn Kant Shukla -- all employees of CISS-B security agency -- have been arrested. The FIR has been filed at Sector 39 police station. “On Wednesday, they were detained for questioning. Later, they were arrested. If anyone else’s role in the assault comes to light, we will initiate necessary action,” Rajeev Balyan, SHO of sector 39, said. The men have been booked under IPC sections 147 and 148 (rioting), 308 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 504 (Intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and 120B (criminal conspiracy). A senior police officer said neither the security agency nor the guards had filed any complaint against Singh so far. Tej Prakash, the president of Lotus Boulevard’s AOA, told TOI that a decision had been taken to replace the security agency, but the process is likely to take at least a month. “CISS-B was hired by the AOA in February 2021. There are 3,000 flats and five entry and exits. So, we need over a hundred guards to man the society. This is the first time we have received a complaint against the guards deployed at the society or the agency,” Prakash said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/7-guards-lb-security-head-arrested-for-assault/articleshow/86082972.cms||Avishek Kumar Dubey

---||Dehradun||NTCA seeks factual report on decision to open Satyanarayan-Kansro, a critical core tiger habitat in RTR||Dehradun: The recent decision of the state forest department to open an approximately 19 km stretch between Satyanarayan and Kansro, a 'critical tiger habitat' of the Rajaji Tiger Reserve (RTR), has invited the ire of National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) which has sought a ‘factual report’ from the forest department on the "illegal opening of tourism in the critical area". This follows a notice sent by SC advocate Gaurav Bansal to the NTCA alleging that allowing tourism in this critical tiger habitat of Rajaji for an entire year without "scientific and objective criteria" and without consulting the expert committee was "illegal". Notably, the stretch has an abundance of leopards and elephants. Bansal told TOI the move will also pose a threat to the flora & fauna of the tiger reserve. Sources privy to the matter said that the decision to open the stretch was taken after the gypsy association members met the forest authorities demanding the opening of the stretch as the Motichur gate has been lying shut after the translocation of tigers since last December and the reserve shut for outsiders since the pandemic in March. Forest minister Harak Singh Rawat had also announced in June that all the zones of Corbett and Rajaji would be opened for tourism round the year. Conservationists had disapproved of the idea saying that it wouldn't allow relaxation or breeding time for the wild animals due to constant human interference. On September 3, chief wildlife warden of forest department JS Suhag issued a written order to open Satyanarayan Gate and other parts of Rajaji from October 1 onwards instead of its usual date of opening of November 15. The NTCA has sought a response on the early opening of the reserve too. Meanwhile, the director of Corbett, Rahul, told TOI that the written orders to open Corbett round the year have not been received yet. RTR has 10 ranges out of which Chilla, Motichur, Haridwar, Chillawali and Ramgarh are frequented by tourists. The entire reserve is spread across 819 sq km.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ntca-seeks-factual-report-on-decision-to-open-satyanarayan-kansro-a-critical-core-tiger-habitat-in-rtr/articleshow/86076406.cms||Shivani Azad

The incident happened at Morgar village in Bhachau taluka of Kutch district in the early hours of Wednesday morning. The victim has been identified as Ashok Bhabhor. The deceased’s sister, Surekha, lodged a complaint against four persons, including the girl who was in a relationship with Ashok. In her complaint, Surekha named Vishnu Koli, Mahesh Koli, Mahendra Koli and Shilpa Koli. The accused are native of Karsangadh village in Radhanpur taluka of Patan district. Ashok and his sister Surekha, natives of Vankdi village in Santrampur taluka of Mahisagar district, were working as farm labourers in Morgar village. “Ashok and Shilpa were in love and they used to meet regularly. But Shilpa’s family was against the relation and they laid a trap to eliminate Ashok. Shilpa was asked to call Ashok for a meeting in a farm behind her house. When an unsuspecting Ashok arrived at the spot on Tuesday night, he was attacked by Shilpa’s family members. They kept beating Ashok from Tuesday night till early morning of Wednesday. When Ashok succumbed to the beating, the accused fled the spot,” police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/man-murdered-over-lover-affair-in-kutch/articleshow/86077217.cms||---

The court of additional district and sessions judge (II) Kaushik Mishra also slapped a fine of Rs 5,000 each on the two, failing which they will have to spend an additional six months in jail. The duo – identified as Sadhu Bharti and Madhu Bharti – believed that deceased Faudar Bharti (55) was responsible for their brother Kamlesh Bharti’s death. Kamlesh died in Nonia Pali village under Huntergunj block of the district in 2009. Suspecting their uncle’s hand in Kamlesh’s death, Sadhu, Madhu and their other two brothers -- Pravesh Bharti and Ramesh Bharti -- dragged Faudar out of his house and tied his limbs. They then beat him up with sticks and struck him with an axe, resulting in his death on the spot. The incident took place on March 20, 2009 and Huntergunj police found his body near Beluri river on March 23. Later, Faudar’s daughter Pramila Kumari lodged an FIR against the four brothers and on March 26, 2019, Sadhu and Madhu were arrested. Ramesh was held earlier this week while Pravesh is still missing, police said. The arrested duo had filed a bail petition in the Jharkhand high court but it was rejected. The court had passed an order for speedy trial in the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/chatra-court-hands-life-term-to-2-for-killing-uncle/articleshow/86077800.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Waste of money, poor quality work in Jharkhand projects, says CAG||Ranchi: The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India’s latest report, which was tabled in the state assembly on Wednesday, pointed out wastage of public money, corruption and constructions using sub-standard materials in Jharkhand when the BJP-led Raghubar Das government was in office. According to the report, several bridges constructed between 2014 and 2019 under the state and the centrally-sponsored rural connectivity schemes were of poor quality which compromised safety, resulting in cave-ins and wastage of public money, the report said. On Thursday, the principal auditor general of the state, Indu Agarwal, briefed the media about the CAG report, which covered general, social, economic and revenue sectors. She said, “Many bridges were of poor quality and the consultants engaged did not follow the prescribed civil construction norms like hydrological survey and designs among others since there were no government checks and balance in place.” She added that they have recommended the government to conduct a safety audit of all such bridges and take action against the erring individuals. The CAG conducted the audit of rural connectivity structures (mainly bridges) between September 2019 and March 2020 in six sample districts of Jharkhand. These bridges were constructed under the Mukhya Mantri Gram Setu Yojana (MMGSY), which is an extension of the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, when the BJP-led government led by chief minister Raghubar Das was in power. Agarwal said they have found that the MMGSY scheme was executed without adhering to the operational guidelines and the department concerned did not perform any survey to assess the scheme’s execution, leading to shoddy work. She gave examples of six bridges, valued at Rs 52.07 crore, which were sub-standard and said nobody was brought to book for the poor work. In the absence of any proper operational guidelines and penalty clauses, the consultants, who were roped in for preparing the detailed project reports, were given undue benefits at various levels. “The tender and agreement documents were loaded in favour of the contractors and the periodic maintenance clause of the completed bridges was missing, resulting in their premature damage and cave-ins,” Agarwal said. Although the scheme is aimed at improving rural connectivity, the report stated that the bridges were randomly built upon recommendations of MPs/MLAs/others without examining their feasibility. “As a result, these bridges were constructed in places where they weren’t required, leading to wasteful expenditure,” she said. Besides finding bridges of poor quality, the report said 208 bridges were incomplete. The report has also found corruption at several levels. For example, it has been found that since 2016, the district welfare officer in Chatra embezzled funds to the tune of Rs 13.59 crore, which were meant for scholarships, in connivance with the cashier of his office but the state welfare department failed to monitor it. “The funds were meant for direct benefit transfer of scholarships to students, but the erring officials usurped funds through dubious cheque withdrawals in the name of their friends and relatives. After we flagged it, action was taken against the culprits,” Agarwal said. Similarly, the auditors also found a lack of proper planning and execution in the construction of tourist facilities across the state. “As many as 39 assets constructed between 2004 and 2018 at a cost of Rs 39.62 crore remained non-operational or operated only partially. There was no formal feasibility study or a survey of its effectiveness before rolling out the construction plans. There wasn’t any proper master plan for the development of tourism or minimum standards fixed for tourism units. While contractors/developers accrued benefits, lack of monitoring and poor management led to the illegal operation of the assets,” the report stated. In terms of revenue generation, the CAG has found anomalies in the assessment and collection of taxes in transport, electricity, commercial taxes, excise and prohibition departments, leading to huge losses to the state ex-chequer. For example, in the excise and prohibition department, the officials didn’t take action to ensure the lifting of minimum guarantee quota liquor by the vendors between April 2016 and July 2017 in four districts, resulting in losses to the tune of Rs 22.46 crore. In public sector undertakings, only the Tenughat Vidyut Nigam Limited managed to make profits but others like JUSNL and JBVNL incurred cumulative losses to the tune of over Rs 500 crore. However, the overall losses incurred by the five power sector PSUs were Rs 479.44 crore in 2018-19, lesser than what it was during 2014-15 (Rs 1518.39 crore), the report said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/waste-of-money-poor-quality-work-in-jharkhand-projects-says-cag/articleshow/86078683.cms||ASRP Mukesh

For years authorities and environment activists failed to convince pandal organizers to limit the Ganesh idol size. But the Covid pandemic has ensured that the idol sizes are not more than four feet this time. Though thousands of Ganesh pandals have been set up in different areas of the city, none of them have installed big idols. “The government has given strict guidelines this time and asked the pandal organizers to not install idols beyond four feet of height. Since decades, we have been installing Ganesh murti of at least 20 feet but this time we have opted for a three feet tall idol,” said Jay Thakore of Pratap Marghani Pol Yuvak Mandal, one of the oldest pandals in the city. The pandal organizers also lamented that the government issued guidelines very late. “The guidelines came out just a few days ago so it wasn’t possible for us to get Ganesh idols of our liking due to the uncertainty. We went for a simple Ganesh idol with a creative background representing Vadodara,” Thakore said. “We began making two and three feet Ganesh idols a few weeks ago. But no pandal organizer had ordered big murtis as the government hadn’t issued any guidelines earlier. When the notification was released, it was too late for even us to make such big idols. So, this year all the idols we made are not more than four feet high,” said Ghanshyam Kahar, one of the popular artists in the city. The police have said that it will monitor the festival and not allow big Ganesh idols as well as huge pandals. “We have installed a three feet tall idol in our pandal that has been prepared as per the government guidelines that have been issued considering the public safety amid the Covid pandemic,” said Nailesh Brahmbhatt, chairman of Manmohan Yuvak Mandal and Charitable Trust in Manjalpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/ganesha-pandals-stick-to-size-guidelines-small-idols-in-vadodara/articleshow/86076525.cms||Tushar Tere

If an MLA had not raised a demand for a discussion, it would have taken half the time to pass the four bills. The bills include Jharkhand Open University Bill, 2021 which was declared pass through voice vote at 2.25pm followed by Jharkhand State Panchayati Raj Amendment Bill, 2021, the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Amendment Bill, 2021 and Jharkhand Finance Bill, 2021, which were once again passed through voice vote at 2.37pm. While the first bill deals with the procedures laid down for establishment and operationalisation of open universities in the state, the finance bill aims at increasing the fee on various forms, including that used for application of pension, registration of marriage and others by which the government plans to collect an additional revenue of Rs 200 crore. Moving the amendment motion for these two bills, CPI-ML legislator Vinod Singh urged the chair to refer the bills to a select committee so that the members can minutely study the proposals. “The house has remained in pandemonium and still a few MLAs are in the well. We were given copies of the bills yesterday (Wednesday) morning so how can a member go through the contents and present the amendments within 36 hours, especially when the house never remained in order?” he asked. No attention was, however, paid to his demand and the bills were passed by voice vote at a time when the slogans of opposition were louder and audible than the ayes or nays. Young Congress legislator Amba Prasad, who is a first-timer, admitted that she was surprised over the way things proceed on the floor of the House. “I am new and learning but it was shocking and saddening for me to witness the kind of uproar on non-issues and complete ignorance of the members towards contents of the bill,” she said. Asked why she did not think of seeking a debate on the bills for better clarity, Amba said the next session onwards, she would come prepared. “This matter was discussed in our legislative party meeting this time in the presence of our state in-charge RPN Singh,” she said. Speaker Ravindra Nath Mahto also expressed displeasure over the situation that prevailed in the House because of which very little business could be transacted. “A huge amount of public money is used in conducting the sessions and we must be mindful of the fact that it is the responsibility of both treasury and opposition benches to justify that expenditure,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/assembly-passes-4-bills-in-12-mins/articleshow/86078760.cms||Jaideep Deogharia
