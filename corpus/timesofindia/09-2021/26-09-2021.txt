This meant cinema halls, auditoriums, ranga mandiras and pubs to function normally from October 1, with safety caveats in place. Those entering these spaces need to have at least one dose of vaccine. Cinema halls back to normal capacity, but there are clauses Starting October 1, cinema halls will be allowed to have 100% occupancy in all districts that have a TPR below 1%. For those districts above 1% and below 2%, the 50% occupancy rule continues. The districts who register a TPR of above 2% will have cinema halls shutting down. In an additional move for caution, pregnant women and children will not be allowed. Standard Covid safety protocols need to be followed. Suraj Gowda, actor and director of Ninna Sanihake that releases on October 8, shares, "This is a welcome move from the government. We respect their decision to wait till the time is right. We now hope people return to cinema halls to celebrate it like it ought to be done." Read AlsoSchools, cinemas &amp; pubs in Karnataka to run 100% from OctoberWith fresh Covid-19 infections under control, the Karnataka government on Friday allowed schools and colleges to conduct regular in-person classes for grades 6-12 with 100% student attendance from October 1, besides giving nod for cinema halls, movie theatres and pubs to operate with 100% capacityAuditoriums and ranga mandiras benefit too The low TPR in the state has also led the government to allow auditoriums and ranaga mandiras to also function with 100% occupancy, with similar caveats in place like those for cinema halls. This has led to many dancers, musicians and theatre persons expressing joy over this move. October fest for pubs While the tipplers had some bars and lounges open, now the pubs will finally be able to throw open their doors from October 3. The rules for entry into pubs remain similar to those for cinema halls. A pub owner shares, "Draught beer is one of the most widely selling beverages in cities like Bengaluru. This is good news, hence." Schools can reopen with full attendance for higher classes The government has also given a nod for offline classes with full attendance to be conducted for classes 6 to 12 for five days a week. Extended curfew time The night curfew still stands imposed, but the curfew has been extended till 10 pm, which allows more breathing time for restaurants, bars and pubs. This also helps cinema halls and performance venues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengalurus-creative-folk-and-nightlife-enthusiast-rejoice-lifts-on-covid-related-curbs/articleshow/86506541.cms||Sunayana Suresh

Addressing a press conference, he said the MVA government had issued an ordinance to give quota to OBCs in local bodies' bypolls to be held on October 5, while the state election commission has issued a notification that the bypolls will be held as scheduled. He said the ordinance would have been useful if it was issued before the poll notification came out, adding that the chain of events showed the MVA government was misleading the OBC community. He said the Supreme Court, which read down OBC quota in local bodies some months ago, had directed the state government on March 4 to collect empirical data on OBCs but the latter had done nothing since then. The Maharashtra government had not made provision of funds for the Backward Classes Commission either, he added. The state government, which has been directed to obtain empirical data on OBCs, was misleading people by raising the issue of census etc, the BJP state general secretary alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/obc-quota-stop-bypolls-approach-sc-bjp-leader-tells-maharashtra-govt/articleshow/86516552.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Cyber fraudsters, who duped people on pretext of winning jackpot, nabbed from Niwari district||BHOPAL: Cyber-crime branch on Saturday claimed to have busted a racket involved in duping people online after luring them in their trap of winning a telecom company jackpot of Rs 7 lakh and a car from Niwari district. Police arrested four accused including two brothers all residents of a village in Jhansi in UP on the border of Niwari district. The kingpin of the gang is a BSc graduate and a diploma holder in lab technician course while the others were educated till class 10, 8, and 7 respectively. Police said that the village has become a hub of cyber-fraudsters and many villagers were involved in online fraud cases like the infamous Jamtara district of Jharkhand. Police seized five mobile phones and SIM cards from their possession which they used to dupe a Govindpura based 25-year-old youth to the tune of Rs 1.40 lakh. The accused tried to dispose off the evidence in the case by breaking their smartphones, SIM cards, and ATM cards and throwing away them in the nullah. The accused burnt one of their smartphones. The accused revealed that they were involved in duping people for the past two years. They searched the mobile phone numbers of a particular telecom company over the internet and then randomly called the SIM users. They called the victims posing themselves as officials of the telecom company and informed them that they had won a jackpot of Rs 7 lakh and a car in the lucky draw of their mobile number. Once the victim fell in their trap, they siphoned money from them on the pretext of various processing fees including GST charge, file charge, advocate's fees, tax and others. After receiving the money, they broke contact with the victims. Police were still searching the accused who provided bank account opened on forged documents to the accused to receive money from the victims. Investigation officer SI BL Prajapati said that complainant Pushpraj Godbole (25), a resident of Gayatri Nagar in Govindpura, works in a private firm and gets a salary of Rs 8,000 per month. He told police that on August 9, he received a call from an unidentified number on which the caller introduced himself from a telecom company. The caller told him that he had won the jackpot of Rs 7 lakh cash and a car in a lucky draw. The accused said that for receiving the jackpot money and car, he will have to deposit processing fees and tax. Pushpraj told his mother about the jackpot and she exclaimed with joy. The caller talked to her too and convinced her to deposit the money into his account. The mother-son duo fell into the trap and arranged money by selling their jewellery and borrowing loans on interest. They deposited Rs 1.40 lakh into the fraudster's bank account within three days but received nothing. The people, who gave them loans started threatening Pushpraj and the family was living in fear. He then approached the cyber-crime branch and filed a complaint. SI Prajapati said that police on basis of technical evidence nabbed the accused identified as Ravindra Kushwah, his brother Rakesh Kushwah, Prem Narayan Kushwah and Mohan Kushwah, all residents of Waman Negua village in Jhansi Uttar Pradesh, from Niwari district. They had disposed of all the evidence against them but Ravindra was caught on an ATM camera while he was withdrawing the money deposited by the victim from his bank account using the ATM card which they broke and disposed of. Ravindra is the kingpin of the gang and he is a BSc graduate holding a diploma in medical lab technology. His brother Rakesh is educated till class 10 while Prem Narayan till class8 and Mohan till class 7.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-cyber-fraudsters-who-duped-people-on-pretext-of-winning-jackpot-nabbed-from-niwari-district/articleshow/86516497.cms||Sudeept Mishra

Another mRNA vaccine is in its last phase of development. India’s scientists are also engaged in the development of a nasal vaccine for Corona,” he said.

India earned considerable goodwill when the Modi government launched “Vaccine Maitri” initiative to reach vaccines to the under-resourced capitals at a time when developed countries stubbornly refused to look beyond their shores. The second wave derailed the vaccine initiative as New Delhi decided to first look after its own. Highlighting India’s achievements and progress in Covid vaccine development despite limited resources, the PM said the country lives by ‘Seva Paramo Dharma’ (service is the main duty) and is engaged in vaccine development and manufacturing with full dedication. While Ahmedabad-based Zydus Cadila’s three-dose anti-Covid jab ZyCoV-D has got emergency use authorisation for those above 12 years of age, Pune-based biotechnology firm Gennova Biopharmaceuticals is working on the country’s first mRNA-based Covid vaccine. Besides, Bharat Biotech is conducting trials with a nasal vaccine. Underlining the government’s latest decision to resume export of anti-Covid jabs, the PM said: “Understanding its responsibility towards humanity, India has once again started giving vaccines to the needy in the world.” At a time when countries across the globe are battling the pandemic with limited access to and availability of vaccines as well as other medical solutions, PM Modi’s speech is seen as an effort to transform the image of India to a crisis-manager.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/come-make-in-india-modi-woos-global-vaccine-manufacturers/articleshow/86518548.cms||---

Dulla Jameel, a resident of Arnas in J&K’s Reasi district, was wanted in a terrorism-related case registered in 2002 at Chatroo police station. “Based on a tip-off, a police team raided various suspected locations and arrested the accused, who was putting up at Kundwar village in Kishtwar’s Chatroo area,” a police spokesperson said. The accused was produced in a local court, which sent him to judicial custody. On September 17, J&K Police had arrested an ex-terrorist, Abdul Gani, from Kishtwar’s Marwah. Gani had been evading arrest for the past 20 years. On September 15, Nazir Ahmad of Budhar-Bonjwah, also an ex-terrorist, was arrested after a long search of 12 years. On July 6, Kishtwar Police arrested Naeem Ahmed, a resident of Kishtwar’s Tattani, who was wanted in a case registered 13 years ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/19-years-on-the-run-ex-terrorist-arrested-in-jk/articleshow/86518682.cms||Sanjay Khajuria
---||Business||After US agreement on fraud charges, Huawei CFO reaches homeland China finally||Huawei chief financial officer (CFO) Meng Wanzhou flew home to China on Friday after reaching an agreement with the United States prosecutors to end the bank fraud case against her, relieving a point of tension between the two countries. Within hours of the news of the deal, two Canadians who were arrested shortly after Meng was taken into custody in December 2018, were released from Chinese jails and were on their way back to Canada. Beijing had denied that their arrests were linked. A person familiar with the matter said Meng, the daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei had left Canada on a flight to Shenzhen. The years-long extradition drama has been a central source of discord in increasingly rocky ties between Beijing and Washington, with Chinese officials signaling that the case needed to be dropped to help end a diplomatic stalemate. The deal also opens US President Joe Biden to criticism from China hawks in Washington who argue his administration is capitulating to China and one of its top companies at the centre of a global technology rivalry between the two countries. Meng was arrested at Vancouver International Airport on a US warrant, and indicted on bank and wire fraud charges for allegedly misleading HSBC in 2013 about the telecommunications equipment giant's business dealings in Iran. In an exclusive on Friday, Reuters reported that the United States had reached a deferred prosecution agreement with Meng. Nicole Boeckmann, the acting US attorney in Brooklyn, said that in entering into the agreement, "Meng has taken responsibility for her principal role in perpetrating a scheme to defraud a global financial institution." The agreement pertains only to Meng, and the US Justice Department said it is preparing for trial against Huawei and looks forward to proving its case in court. China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the release of Meng or the Canadians, neither did a spokeswoman for Huawei. The two Canadians, businessman Michael Spavor and former diplomat Michael Kovrig, had been held in China for more than 1,000 days. In August, a Chinese court sentenced Spavor to 11 years in prison for espionage. The International Crisis Group, where Kovrig works, said it was "overjoyed" at the "most just decision" to release him, thanking Canada and the United States for their roles. "The day we have been waiting for 1,020 days has finally arrived," the advocacy group said in a statement. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters in brief remarks late on Friday the two men had left Chinese airspace just minutes before. He was not asked whether the two countries had struck a bilateral deal. "I want to thank our allies and partners around the world in the international community who have stood steadfast in solidarity with Canada and with these two Canadians," he said. Meanwhile, at the hearing in Brooklyn federal court on Friday, which Meng attended virtually from Canada, assistant US attorney David Kessler said the government would move to dismiss the charges against her if she complies with all of her obligations under the agreement, which ends in December 2022. He added that Meng will be released on a personal recognisance bond, and that the United States plans to withdraw its request to Canada for her extradition. Meng pleaded not guilty to the charges in the hearing. When US District Court Judge Ann Donnelly later accepted the deferred prosecution agreement, Meng sighed audibly. A Canadian judge later signed Meng's order of discharge, vacating her bail conditions and allowing her to go free after nearly three years of house arrest. She was emotional after the judge's order, hugging and thanking her lawyers. Speaking to supporters and reporters on the steps of the court afterward, Meng thanked the judge for her "fairness" and talked of how the case had turned her life "upside down". Meng was confined to her expensive Vancouver home at night and monitored 24/7 by private security that she paid for as part of her bail agreement. Referred to by Chinese state media as the "Princess of Huawei", she was required to wear an electronic ankle bracelet to monitor her movements, which became fodder for the tabloids when it hung above her designer shoes. 'Huawei confidential'Articles published by Reuters in 2012 about Huawei, Hong Kong-registered company Skycom and Meng figured prominently in the US criminal case against her. Reuters reported that Skycom had offered to sell at least 1.3 million euros worth of embargoed Hewlett-Packard computer equipment to Iran's largest mobile-phone operator in 2010. Reuters also reported numerous financial and personnel links between Huawei and Skycom, including that Meng had served on Skycom's board of directors between February 2008 and April 2009. The stories prompted HSBC to question Meng about Reuters findings. Huawei was placed on a US trade blacklist in 2019 that restricts sales to the company for activities contrary to the US national security and foreign policy interests. The restrictions have hobbled the company, which suffered its biggest revenue drop in the first half of 2021, after the US supply restrictions drove it to sell a chunk of its once-dominant handset business before new growth areas have matured. The criminal case against Meng and Huawei is cited in the blacklisting. Huawei is charged with operating as a criminal enterprise, stealing trade secrets and defrauding financial institutions. It has pleaded not guilty. A Canadian government official said Ottawa would not comment until the US court proceedings were over. China vs USHuawei has become a dirty word in Washington, with China hawks in Congress quick to react to any news that could be construed as the United States being soft, despite Huawei's struggles under the trade restrictions. Then-President Donald Trump politicised the case when he told Reuters soon after Meng's arrest that he would intervene if it would serve national security or help secure a trade deal. Meng's lawyers have said she was a pawn in the political battle between the two super powers. Republican China hardliners in Congress called Friday's deal a "capitulation". "Instead of standing firm against China's hostage-taking and blackmail, President Biden folded," Republican Senator Tom Cotton said in a statement. Senior US officials have said that Meng's case was being handled solely by the Justice Department and the case had no bearing on the US approach to strained ties with China. During US deputy secretary of state Wendy Sherman's July trip to China, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Xie Feng insisted that the United States drop its extradition case against Meng. The US officials have acknowledged that Beijing had linked Meng's case to the case of the two detained Canadians, but insisted that Washington would not be drawn into viewing them as bargaining chips.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/after-us-agreement-on-fraud-charges-huawei-cfo-finally-reaches-homeland-china/articleshow/86517992.cms||---
---||World||Kashmir motion condemning India fails, won’t be debated at Labour conference||LONDON: An attempt by Labour party members in the constituency of Pakistan-origin Labour MP Naz Shah, who called Prime Minister Modi a "butcher" last week, to get a Kashmir motion debated and voted on at the Labour party annual conference has spectacularly failed. The Kashmir motion put forward by Bradford West CLP (constituency Labour party) garnered just 20,413 votes from CLP members in the priority ballet carried out on Saturday and no votes from affiliate members. Motions on mental health, social care, and the green new deal got the highest number of votes, with social care getting a little over a million votes in the ballot. Dr Neeraj Patil, chairman of Hindus for Labour, said: "The British Hindu community is pleased to note that the Labour Party under the new leadership of Kier Starmer is adopting a bipartisan approach on the bilateral issue of Kashmir. This is a welcome move for forging better relationship between the Labour Party and the British Hindu community. The motion was overwhelmingly defeated and got one of the lowest votes." The defeated motion had called for condemning the Indian government’s actions in Kashmir and to urge Labour MPs and Labour party leader Starmer to commit to ending human rights abuses in the region and to "mediations between India, Pakistan and the Kashmiri people" to seek self -determination for the Kashmiri people. It was one of 50 motions that were submitted to the conference by CLPs, trade unions and other bodies. The Labour party conference in Brighton kicked off this weekend. This motion called on conference to resolve to lobby British MPs, the UK and EU Parliaments and the UN to "ensure recognition of the ongoing humanitarian crisis and rights abuses in Kashmir" as well as "fulfilment of the Kashmiri people’s right to self-determination in accordance with UN resolutions" and for humanitarian aid organisations and international observers to be allowed to enter Jammu and Kashmir. It condemned the Indian government’s revocation of Articles 370 and 35A of the Constitution and "the ongoing imposition of restrictions". The defeated motion pointed out that while the Indian government had "hindered journalism", kept elected Kashmiri politicians under detention, and not allowed Indian political opposition, including Indian MPs, to visit Kashmir, it had "enabled a visit to Kashmir by European politicians representing far-right parties". At the September 2019 conference, an emergency motion on Kashmir that said that the people of Kashmir should be given the right of self-determination in accordance with UN resolutions and called for international observers to enter the region was unanimously passed, causing a major rift between the Labour party and India. The Indian high commission in London cancelled its annual reception with Labour Friends of India and more than 70 British Indian organisations wrote a collective letter to the then Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, warning that the motion could destroy UK-India diplomatic relations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/kashmir-motion-condemning-india-fails-wont-be-debated-at-labour-conference/articleshow/86519311.cms||NAOMI CANTON

In a statement, Mirwaiz said that day in and day out extreme laws are being introduced to further curb people's freedom and intimidate them into silence through fear of retribution. “Sudden dismissal of government employees without any investigation, or being given a chance to be heard, is part of this policy as six more government employees have been sacked by the ruling dispensation,” Mirwaiz said in the statement. So far, the authorities have sacked two dozen government employees on charges of having links with terror activities, or for their affiliation to Jamiat-e-Islamia, the statement said. The APHC chairman further said that such dictatorial approach would only create more dissent and anger. “Continued raids by government agencies on organisations and homes of people and slapping of PSA and other harsh laws on them, picking up of youths, their arbitrary arrests and constant surveillance of people continue unabated across J&K as a state policy, as the number of Kashmiris in jails and detention centres further swelled. Thousands, including political leaders and activists, continue to languish in jails for years on end without any remedy. The APHC chairman himself has been placed under arbitrary house detention for the past twenty-six months now,” the statement added. It quoted Mirwaiz as saying that the situation in J&K is simmering and people, especially the youth, are feeling suffocated, which can have serious consequences.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mirwaiz-accuses-centre-of-repression-in-kashmir/articleshow/86519423.cms||M Saleem Pandit

Two people were killed and nine were injured on August 30 as seven vehicles plunged, one after another, into a deep pit that opened up on the dark, rural stretch of Mississippi Highway 26 near Lucedale. One of the injured people died in a hospital on September 11. Department of Transportation Director Brad White told legislative budget writers Friday that the department has completed a geotechnical review and will choose a company early next month to repair the damage for about $1.2 million. He said the highway could reopen in about 45 days.  White said the area had already received more than double its average annual rainfall before the hurricane, and then Ida dumped more than 12 inches (30.5 centimeters) of rain in less than one day. The stretch of highway is on a hillside, and White said the deluge blew out a pipe that ran under the roadbed.  "I don't know of any preventative maintenance that could've been done prior to the storm," White said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/mississippi-gets-ready-to-repair-highway-that-collapsed-during-ida/articleshow/86519661.cms||---

"In recent days, the images of the treatment of several of my compatriots on the border between Mexico and the United States have shocked more than one," acting Prime Minister Ariel Henry said in a pre-recorded video speech to the General Assembly.  "Without wishing to contest the right of a sovereign state to control the accession of foreigners to its territory, or to send them back to their country of origin those who enter it illegally, we believe that many now prosperous countries have been built by successive waves of migrants and refugees," he added.  Tens of thousands of migrants, mostly Haitians, have arrived in Texas at the border between Mexico and the United States since early September.  Violent scenes of US border guards on horseback confronting the migrants this week drew widespread criticism against Joe Biden's administration.  "This problem of migrants must remind us that human beings, fathers and mothers, will always flee misery and conflicts and seek to find better living conditions for their children," Henry said.  "Migration will continue as long as there are areas of prosperity on our planet while most of the world population lives in precariousness, sometimes extreme, with no prospect of a better life," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/migrations-will-continue-haiti-pm-tells-un-after-border-outrage/articleshow/86519677.cms||---
---||India||Pakistan an arsonist in guise of a fire-fighter: Indian diplomat||NEW DELHI: India’s diplomat Sneha Dubey delivered a fiery rebuttal to Pakistan PM Imran Khan raking up the Jammu & Kashmir issue in his UNGA address, saying Pakistan has nurtured terrorists for long and is an “arsonist disguising itself as a fire-fighter”. Khan’s comments seeking to paint his country as a victim of terrorism, saw young Indian diplomat and first secretary Sneha Dubey responding, “Our region, and in fact the entire world, has suffered because of their policies. On the other hand, they are trying to cover up sectarian violence in their country as acts of terror”. Dubey, an IFS officer of 2012 batch, was exercising India’s right of reply, and added that Pakistan held the ignoble record of hosting the largest number of terrorists proscribed by the UN Security Council. In his nearly 25-minute virtual address, Khan had spoken about the Indian government’s decision to revoke the special status of the erstwhile J&K state and also the death of pro-Pakistan separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani. Dubey said it was regrettable that this was not the first time that the leader of Pakistan had misused platforms provided by the UN to propagate false and malicious propaganda against India, and sought in vain to divert the world’s attention from “the sad state of his country where terrorists enjoy free pass while the lives of ordinary people, especially those belonging to the minority communities, are turned upside down”. In the past too, junior Indian diplomats, usually women, have countered such statements by Pakistan. “We exercise our right of reply to one more attempt by the leader of Pakistan to tarnish the image of this August forum by bringing in matters internal to my country, and going so far as to spew falsehoods on the world stage,” said Dubey, the third Indian woman diplomat at the UN to rebut Pakistan’s claims on J&K. Another blistering response was delivered by 2005-batch IFS officer Eenam Gambhir in 2016. This was followed by a similar right of reply by Vidisha Mishra in 2019. A post-graduate from JNU, Dubey was schooled in Goa and later graduated from a college in Pune. Emphasising India’s position, Dubey said the government desired normal relations with all our neighbours, including Pakistan.”However, it is for Islamabad to work sincerely towards creating a conducive atmosphere, including by taking credible, verifiable and irreversible actions to not allow any territory under its control to be used for cross-border terrorism against India,’’ she said. With the international community marking this month the 20th anniversary of the “dastardly” 9/11 terror attacks, Dubey said the world has not forgotten that the “mastermind behind that dastardly event, Osama bin Laden, got shelter in Pakistan." “Even today we heard the leader of Pakistan trying to justify acts of terror. Such defence of terrorism is unacceptable,” Dubey said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pakistan-an-arsonist-in-guise-of-a-fire-fighter-indian-diplomat/articleshow/86520187.cms||---

China has been accused of manipulating World Bank data to improve its rankings and WHO’s attempt to trace the origin of the novel coronavirus remains inconclusive. Another important element of his address was his focus at the outset on India’s democratic traditions, describing India as “mother of democracy’’, a day after President Joe Biden emphasised on democratic values, tolerance and diversity as characteristics of India-US bilateral ties. Modi said India’s strong democracy is known for its diversity.

Yes, democracy has delivered,’’ said Modi, adding that it was the strength of Indian democracy, which allowed a kid who used to sell tea to address the UNGA for the 4th time as India’s PM. The strongest message though was for Pakistan as he said that countries with regressive thinking, which were using terrorism as a political tool, needed to understand that terrorism can be as dangerous for them. “It is important to ensure that Afghanistan territory is not used to spread terrorism and carry out terrorist attacks,’’ said Modi, drawing applause from those present.

He didn't say anything though on the nature of the Taliban government unlike at the recent SCO summit where he had said the government wasn't inclusive. In another swipe at China, Modi said oceans were common and shared inheritance and it was important that ocean resources were used, and not abused. “Our oceans are the lifeline of international trade.

Each year, the border communities that sit across the Rio Grande from one another come together to celebrate that bond during the Fiesta de la Amistad. Leaders from both sides of the border meet at the festival and share abrazos, or hugs, to commemorate their common history and an agreement between the US and Mexico to build the Amistad Dam and Reservoir in the 1960s.  The relationship shows in many ways, with workers and families typically going back-and-forth between Acuna and Del Rio daily. But that traffic was disrupted for more than a week by the shutdown of the bridge that connects them and serves as a conduit for commerce, culture and community. Officials closed the crossing on September 17 after an encampment made up of mostly Haitian migrants formed around the span. The camp was completely cleared of migrants on Friday, and the US authorities announced the bridge would partially reopen to passenger traffic late Saturday afternoon and to cargo traffic on Monday morning.  Some locals have felt the shutdown keenly.  Acuna resident Gerardo Hernandez (51) was told that starting Wednesday, his salary would be cut by 50 per cent until further notice because of the closure. The materials used at the border assembly plant where he works installing car seats come from the US side.  "We had just begun to work again (because of the pandemic), and now this," Hernandez said. "But the migrants are not at fault. It's the closure."  Del Rio mayor Bruno Lozano said Friday that the bridge closure had cost the city $17,000 a day in tolls and affected the daily flow of $35 million in trade and goods.  In Acuna, dentist offices, beauty salons and bars sat empty, said Luis Angel Urraza, the president of the local chamber of commerce. His popular restaurant, Lucia, wasn't spared.  But the sense of peace that has permeated Del Rio, with its roughly 35,000 mostly Latino residents, and Acuna, with about 163,000 people, has been frayed in recent months by frustration over travel limits between the cities due to the Covid-19 pandemic and by the growing number of migrants coming through the area. The Del Rio sector has become the US Border Patrol's second busiest for apprehensions along the nation's southern border.  Acuna is known for its generosity and hospitality. This relatively safe city along Mexico's northern border, where violence is plentiful, grew with the construction of the US-owned border assembly plants known as maquiladoras in the 1980s and 1990s.  Manuel Casillas, the owner of Abbey Road, a popular Beatles-themed restaurant and bar in Acuna, knows what it's like to live on both sides. He was born in Del Rio and raised in Acuna. He worked in Del Rio for 35 years in a department store. When he retired, he returned to Mexico and opened the bar of his dreams.  Casillas (65) said he is saddened that some of the migrants were being detained.  "Not being able to help them, not being able to give them a job," said Casillas who hired a Cuban dishwasher during a previous migration spike.  County Judge Lewis Owens, the top elected official for Val Verde County, which includes Del Rio, said that despite the recent challenges, the two cities have continued helping each other. Del Rio officials recently administered more than 2,000 Covid-19 vaccine doses to Acuna residents, including workers from maquiladoras, on the border bridge.  But the presence of the camp, which swelled to almost 15,000 migrants at one point, and the additional law enforcement on both sides of the border have rattled the region.  Owens said residents have called him about finding migrants in their yards. In response, some residents have started watering their trees or feeding their dogs with a pistol on their hip, he said.  "People are scared," Owens said. "I think it's going to always be on our minds that it can happen again."  Some Del Rio residents have criticised the presence of the camp and the release of some of the migrants into the US while they make claims before an immigration judge to stay in the country under the asylum laws or for some other legal reason.  "We can't get on an airplane and fly anywhere or go to school without having a shot. They're coming across not inoculated and going wherever they want to go. It's just very, very frustrating for everybody," said Roger Bollinger who owns a drilling company in Del Rio.  At a community centre in Del Rio, the non-governmental organisation Val Verde Border Humanitarian Coalition assisted the migrants throughout the week as they were released, providing them with basic essentials and helping them reach family in the US.  "Our focus is on helping our neighbor," said Tiffany Burrow, the group's operations director.  Del Rio resident Larisa Sanchez is no stranger to the struggles of immigration, and she acknowledged the difficulties the Haitians face while she watched her 10-year-old son Leo's football practice. Her mother was deported when she was a child, and they spent seven years apart while she lived in Del Rio and her mother lived in Acuna. Her mother is now a legal US resident.  "I do feel really bad for them. I do. But I think they do have to go through a process because my mom went through it," Sanchez said. "I guess I have mixed feelings about it."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/amistad-binds-del-rio-and-ciudad-acuna-amid-migrant-crisis/articleshow/86520323.cms||---
---||World||'Amistad' binds Del Rio and Ciudad Acuna amid migrant crisis||DEL RIO: Amistad - Spanish for friendship - binds the sister cities of Del Rio, Texas, and Ciudad Acuna, Mexico.  Each year, the border communities that sit across the Rio Grande from one another come together to celebrate that bond during the Fiesta de la Amistad. Leaders from both sides of the border meet at the festival and share abrazos, or hugs, to commemorate their common history and an agreement between the US and Mexico to build the Amistad Dam and Reservoir in the 1960s.  The relationship shows in many ways, with workers and families typically going back-and-forth between Acuna and Del Rio daily. But that traffic was disrupted for more than a week by the shutdown of the bridge that connects them and serves as a conduit for commerce, culture and community. Officials closed the crossing on September 17 after an encampment made up of mostly Haitian migrants formed around the span. The camp was completely cleared of migrants on Friday, and the US authorities announced the bridge would partially reopen to passenger traffic late Saturday afternoon and to cargo traffic on Monday morning.

The cyclone, christened ‘Gulab’, intensified from a deep depression over north Bay of Bengal on Saturday afternoon and is expected to make landfall by Sunday around Kalingapatnam, between Vishakhapatnam and Gopalpur, the India Meteorological Department said. IMD has issued a red weather warning for extremely heavy rain in parts of Odisha and Andhra Pradesh on Sunday, and in south Chhattisgarh on Monday, by when the system may weaken into a depression. The department has also warned of cyclone-related flooding and destruction, including damage to hutments and other structures while adding that power/communication lines and standing crops could take a hit. Besides, orange alerts for heavy rain have been issued for various days up to September 29 for Vidarbha, Telangana, Marathwada, Konkan coast, including Mumbai, and Gujarat. Cyclones rarely occur during September, particularly when the monsoon is active, as the wind systems associated with the monsoon prevent storms in the Bay of Bengal from intensifying into cyclones. Gulab is likely to be followed back-to-back by a milder cyclonic circulation that will start impacting from the evening of September 28, bringing heavy rain to Bengal, including Kolkata, Odisha and inland regions of central and north India, including Uttar Pradesh and possibly Delhi-NCR.

In his address, the PM said, “On the occasion of 75 years of independence, India is going to launch 75 satellites into space made by Indian students in schools and colleges. To strengthen science-based approach, India is promoting experience-based learning. We have opened thousands of Atal Tinkering Labs and incubators across schools” A start-up ecosystem is being developed in the country, he said. Expressing his views on the importance of a science-based approach for learning, Modi said, “Regressive thinking and extremism is increasingly threatening the world. In these circumstances, the entire world will have to make science-based rational and progressive thinking the basis of their development programmes.” The Initiative of Indian Technology Congress Association (ITCA) has been working on the “75 Student Satellites’ Mission 2022” programme in collaboration with national and international tech-space organisations. The mission comprises a consortium of institutions that would be developing and launching their own student-built satellites by 2022. According to ITCA, 32 institutions are part of the consortium and their teams would be progressing to ‘deep-dive’ technology-capability-business potential assessments with ITCA's mentors and domain experts. It had earlier invited applications from 75 student groups to build 75 nano or small satellites. These groups would be provided an opportunity to use Isro's launchpad to launch their satellites. For student satellite launches, ITCA has also signed an MoU with Israel schools and government to collaborate with Indian institutions. ITCA's initiative is inspired by Modi's idea of “Gaganyaan Space Mission 2022”, which too was earlier scheduled for launch next year to coincide with 75 years of Independence but the country’s maiden human space-flight mission got delayed due to the pandemic and now the launch is delayed. Student satellites gained prominence globally as a hands-on education tool and has emerged as a trend to build experiential learning and demonstrate enhanced practice-based outcomes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-to-launch-75-student-made-satellites-during-75th-year-of-independence-day-pm-modi-at-unga/articleshow/86520369.cms||Surendra Singh

The list was cleared during CM Charanjit Singh Channi’s meeting with Rahul Gandhi that went on past Friday midnight. On returning from Delhi, Channi met Punjab governor Banwarilal Purohit on Saturday, and 15 cabinet ministers will now be administered the oath of office at 4.30pm on Sunday. Seven new faces are likely to be inducted and five ministers from Amarinder Singh’s team will be left out. Sources said the party has cleared the names of three loyalists of PPCC chief Navjot Singh Sidhu — Pargat Singh, Kuljit Singh Nagra and Amarinder Singh Raja Warring — for induction. The names of Sangat Singh Giljian, a prominent OBC leader of the party, MLA Rajkumar Verka and Gurkirat Kotli (grandson of former CM Beant Singh), too, have been approved. In a surprise move, former irrigation minister Rana Gurjit Singh is expected to make a comeback into the council of ministers. He was earlier a minister in outgoing CM Amarinder Singh’s cabinet but had stepped down after an alleged scam in the allotment of sand mines was linked to his ex-employees. Meanwhile, sources said the party plans to drop former health minister Balbir Sidhu, revenue minister Gurpreet Singh Kangar, industries minister Sunder Sham Arora, social welfare minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot and sports minister Rana Gurmit Singh Sodhi. Most of them were considered to be Amarinder loyalists. Sources also said Channi voted in favour of retaining outgoing minister Aruna Choudhary while minister Brahm Mohindra managed to keep his cabinet berth as the senior-most Hindu legislator amid the controversy over former PPCC chief Sunil Jakhar losing out in the race to become the next CM for not being a Sikh. Warring managed to sail through despite opposition from outgoing finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/channis-new-team-likely-to-have-7-new-faces/articleshow/86520399.cms||Vibhor Mohan
---||World||‘Unwavering’ US commitment for key defence ally India||WASHINGTON: Despite not being military allies by way of a treaty or pact, the US and India pushed ahead with strengthening defence ties in talks between President Joe Biden and PM Narendra Modi on Friday, describing their broad-based relationship as a “partnership for global good.” Unmistakable signs that defence cooperation between the two countries is being upgraded notwithstanding traditional US disquiet over New Delhi’s broad array of military hardware acquisition from other nations came in a statement in which Biden pledged “unwavering commitment to India as a major defence partner”, including strengthening cooperation in advanced military technologies. The statement specifically noted the recent project to co-develop air-launched unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs or drones) under the Defence Technology and Trade Initiative, and encouraged more such joint efforts. It called upon government and private stakeholders to use the existing ecosystems of innovation and entrepreneurship in defence industries for co-development, co-production and expanding mutual defence trade, a mechanism that would not only enable India to circumvent outright purchase, but also get around US legislative hurdles that are subject to domestic politics. Officials said that Biden said it would need two days of talks with Modi, rather than the 90 minutes they took, to cover the full gamut of shared interests. Following up on the talks and his invitation to vice-president Kamala Harris to visit India, Modi also extended an invitation to the US President to visit India. Subject to the pandemic waning, both visits are expected to take place within months. Not that the talks were without wrinkles, mostly relating to trade. Foreign secretary Harsh Shringla said Modi raised the issue of H-1b visas and the continuing impasse over a totalisation agreement, resolving which would enable India to recover billions of dollars that Indian professionals are forced to contribute and give up in taxes even when they don’t intent to immigrate. Meanwhile, Biden reiterated US support for India’s permanent membership on a reformed UN Security Council and its entry into NSG, PTI reported. He also applauded India’s “strong leadership” during its UNSC Presidency in August 2021, as per the US-India joint leaders’ statement. The two countries also strove to be on the same page in terrorism despite differing bilateral priorities with Pakistan, whose help the US needs to extract its people from Afghanistan. Although the statement didn’t explicitly name Pakistan, the inference was obvious: it said the leaders reaffirmed their stand together in a shared fight against global terrorism. They also pledged to further strengthen counterterrorism cooperation, including in the areas of intelligence sharing, law enforcement cooperation and developing counterterrorism technologies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/unwavering-us-commitment-for-key-defence-ally-india/articleshow/86520467.cms||Chidanand Rajghatta

Several states, including Kerala, Karnataka and Maharashtra, are keen to reduce the gap between the two doses of Covishield from the current 84 days. Arora said data from the vaccine tracker platform indicated that the way the Covishield doses were currently being administered was fine, adding that the vaccine’s effectiveness in the current interval was being monitored constantly. Virologist T Jacob John differed a bit. He told TOI that the Covishield doses’ gap could be reduced to four weeks for individuals at high risk and senior citizens. “They (authorities) should at least think about it,” he said. “Two doses save lives. So, for individuals at high risk of severe disease and death, four weeks’ interval is the best,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-change-in-covishield-dose-gap-ntagi-chief/articleshow/86520643.cms||Nisha Nambiar

He was taken to a community health centre, then a district hospital and, finally, SN Medical College, which referred him to a higher centre. But authorities allegedly took him back to jail instead. A Lucknow court has now asked the authorities to take him to a better hospital, which the DM said is being worked out now. Rahman had been arrested on sedition and UAPA charges in October last year and has been incarcerated at the Mathura prison. In December, the Enforcement Directorate had stepped in to investigate money laundering charges against Rahman and the three others. He was being taken to a special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court in Lucknow when his condition deteriorated. “He was initially admitted to a community health centre, from where he was moved to the Agra district hospital and, later, referred to SN Medical College. There, the doctors advised him to be admitted to a higher centre — AIIMS in Delhi or SGPGI (Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences) in Lucknow. But the government authorities took him back to Mathura jail,” Rahman’s father-in-law Sakhawat Khan wrote in a letter to the DM. “Considering the fact that the trial has not commenced and presumption of his innocence exists, he may be provided urgent medical treatment at AIIMS or an equivalent centre.” TOI had earlier reported that Rahman has a congenital heart disease. He has aortic regurgitation, a condition in which the aortic valve does not close tightly. He was being treated at AIIMS Delhi before he was arrested. “He has to be provided urgent and proper treatment. The authorities know his medical status,” defence counsel Madhuvan Dutt Chaturvedi told TOI. When his counsel moved court on Thursday, sessions judge of special court PMLA, Sarvesh Kumar, asked Mathura district jail authorities to provide the right treatment to Rahman, ensure medical facilities were provided and move him to a higher centre for proper treatment if required. The court also asked for a report on Rahman’s medical condition. The next hearing is on October 12. Mathura DM Navneet Singh Chahal said Rahman is stable now. Chahal added, “We are in the process of sending him to AIIMS as soon as possible.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/student-held-on-way-to-hathras-suffers-cardiac-disorder-sent-back-to-jail/articleshow/86515574.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

India reported 28,171 fresh cases of the coronavirus on Saturday, the number having steadily fallen from this week’s high 32,028 recorded on Wednesday. While daily cases on the first three days of the week were on a par with the corresponding days of the previous week, the numbers have since declined. Fresh cases in Kerala have followed the same pattern, with numbers on the first three days of the week comparable to the same days of last week, followed by a decline in the past two days. The state logged 16,671 new cases on Saturday, down from 17,983 reported a day earlier. Kerala’s daily test positivity rate, although still high, declined to below 15% at 14.54% on Saturday. The state announced more lockdown relaxations, allowing restaurants and bars to open. Tamil Nadu’s daily case count remained relatively high with 1,724 fresh infections.

His body was discovered by locals at Kakhadi village near Dhabaleswar, six km from the mishap site. Murmu (38), one of the five ODRAF jawans, had gone missing when the inflatable boat they were in capsized while negotiating a strong current near the Mundali barrage. He had joined ODRAF as a diver in 2013 and is survived by wife and two children — a minor son and daughter. “ODRAF personnel Sitaram Murmu, an expert diver &swimmer missing in Ydays unfortunate boat tragedy is reported dead. Body found near Dhabaleswar. Very saddened. RIP. I request @DGPOdisha 2review SOP & order no outsider, civilian or media should be part of any rescue mission,” special relief commissioner Pradeep Kumar Jena tweeted. On Friday, OTV chief reporter Arindam Das had drowned while trying to cover the rescue mission. His cameraman Pravat Sinha and two other ODRAF personnel are undergoing treatment at SCB Medical College and Hospital, Cuttack. Chief minister Naveen Patnaik on Saturday sanctioned Rs 4 lakh for Das’s family from the Odisha Working Journalist Welfare Fund. Till filing of this report, forest officials and NDRF could not locate the elephant, which until Friday evening had stayed put in the water. “We don’t have any information on whether the elephant has died or swam to safety,” said Md Jamil, divisional forest officer (Chandaka wildlife sanctuary). The ODRAF has come under criticism for its misadventure, leading to the death of a journalist and one of its own jawans. “A tusker weighing more than two tonne can’t be tamed by a few persons in water in the middle of a strong current. The animal should have been left to negotiate the water and come out on its own,” said Anup Nayak, former member secretary, National Tiger Conservation Authority.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/missing-odraf-mans-body-found-a-day-after-mishap/articleshow/86516389.cms||Riyan Ramanath V

The Chief Justice said even after 74 years of independence, traditional and agrarian societies that have been following customary ways of life, feel hesitant to approach the courts. “The practices, procedures, language and everything of the courts feel alien to them. Between the complex language of the acts and process of justice delivery, the common man seems to lose control over the fate of his grievance. Often in his trajectory, the justice seeker feels like an outsider to the system,” the CJI said after dedicating to the people the new building of Odisha State Legal Services Authority (OSLSA) in Cuttack. The CJI said the judicial system faces twin challenges — the need to Indianise the judiciary system, that is adaptation to the practical realities of Indian society, and enabling the people to decode the justice delivery system by raising awareness. He said it is the general understanding of people that it is the court’s responsibility to make laws. The CJI said this notion has to be dispelled, which is where the role of other organs of the state — the legislature and the executive assumes great significance. The legislature needs to revisit the laws and reform them to suit the needs of time and people. “I emphasise that our laws must match with our practical realities. The executive has to match these efforts by way of simplifying the rules. Most importantly, the executive and the legislature should function in unison in realising the constitutional aspirations,” the CJI said. “It is then only that the judiciary would not be compelled to step in as a lawmaker and would only be left with the duty of applying and interpreting the same. At the end of the day it is the harmonious functioning of the three organs of the state that can remove the procedural barriers to justice,” Justice Ramana said. The CJI said in India the task to facilitate access to justice to the poor and marginalised has been conferred upon the legal services institutions — their activities including increasing legal awareness and legal literacy among the masses who have essentially remained outside the purview of our system. He said lack of proper infrastructure and funding result in reduction of the activities carried out by these institutions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/cuttack/need-to-make-justice-delivery-system-more-people-friendly/articleshow/86513687.cms||lalmohan.patnaik

The authorities at the prison decided to open a library on the premises as part of the measures to reform the inmates. The response from the inmates has been overwhelmingly positive, with many of them spending hours together, immersed in the wondrous world of books. The sub-jail in Hubballi houses 120 prisoners, among whom more than 20 are students. These inmates, prone to getting involved in clashes and altercations with each other, are now putting their time to better use by browsing through magazines and newspapers to stay abreast of the latest developments across the world, reading fiction and the various genres of books that the library has to offer. Superintendent of Hubballi Sub-Jail Ashok Bhajantri said that the library, opened to the inmates in April, housed more than 1,000 books. “Inmates who were students prior to their brush with the law, seem inclined to read books on competitive examinations, while the elderly prisoners are understandably drawn to spiritual titles and myths including the Ramayana, Mahabharata, et al,” Bhajantri said. He said that the staff at the prison had observed a visible change in the behaviour of the inmates following the opening of the library. “Jail personnel ensure that the inmates get any book they want regardless of the hour. The inmates borrow books in the morning and spend the better part of the day reading,” Bhajantri added. Among the notable titles available at the library include works of Kuvempu, Da Ra Bendre, Maasti Venkatesh Iyengar, SL Bhyrappa, Devanooru Mahadeva and Chandrashekara Kamabra. The prisoners appealed to Judge KN Gangadhar to help set up a library at the sub-jail, when he had visited the facility on the occasion of Human Rights Day last December. Based on his directions, the jail superintendent allotted space for the library on the premises, and it was opened to the inmates in April. ‘Keeping inmates engaged key to their mental health’ Lack of activity drives the inmates to boredom, making them irritable. Activities such as reading not only ensures they are engaged, but it also helps distract them from their present situation, and keep disturbing thoughts, be they about the past or the future, at bay. Additionally, information gained from self-help books will offer them unique perspectives, which can help them improve their life. Engaging inmates in such activities is vital to their mental wellbeing. - Dr Sahitya BR | Assistant Professor of Clinical Psychology, Dharwad Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/library-at-hubballi-sub-jail-keeps-inmates-engaged-peaceful/articleshow/86517099.cms||J Abbas Mulla
---||Kolkata||Admission helplines flooded with requests for 2nd chance||Kolkata: Many colleges have been flooded with calls to their helplines from stud-ents and their parents requesting the authorities to give them another chance to get admitted after some failed to take admission despite their names being on various merit lists. Principals and admission committee officials have said that most students fill up college admission applications from cyber cafes because some either lack a proper device or a strong network connection. After filling up the forms, applicants do not regularly check when the merit lists are published and depend on “cyber café dadas” to inform them. As a result, they miss out on important updates like last dates of admission for a particular cycle and registrations for wish lists. Many principals said this was one of the reasons why so many seats remain vacant in colleges even after a deluge of applications and high marks. Many colleges and universities had started helplines and provided e-mail IDs before admissions began where students could seek help regarding admissions. “There have been requests from students and their parents asking for another chance because they could not take admission earlier,” said Asok Mukhopadhyay, principal of Seth Anandram Jaipuria College. “Most students depend on cyber café owners for the updates. This is the reason they miss out on important announcements,” said the principal of a reputable college in south Kolkata. Principals said students who failed to take admission on time even when their names figured on the merit list can only be accommodated if seats are available. “There have been several calls from students who had made it to the merit list but did not take admission. Naturally, on subsequent merit lists, those lower in the queue were given the opportunity to take admission. Now when the former have missed the opportunity, they call the helpline asking for another chance,” said Partha Ghosh, senior professor at Bangabasi College and part of the admission committee. “We had something called online reporting, the dates of which were posted on the website well in advance. Many students did not show up and later called requesting another chance,” said an official of Asutosh College.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/admission-helplines-flooded-with-requests-for-2nd-chance/articleshow/86517654.cms||Zeeshan Javed

---||Ahmedabad||Health permit for booze: Guidelines’ bottle empty, admits Gujarat government||AHMEDABAD: In the dry state of Gujarat, a liquor permit is a coveted document – allowing the local resident-holder to obtain it citing health grounds to legally purchase units of liquor from designated permit shops. But when an applicant, under the Right to Information (RTI) Act, inquired about which ailments are covered for the health permit, the state responded there are no guidelines in place! The response is ironic considering that the Gujarat government issued the highest 3,690 fresh liquor permits on health grounds during the pandemic year of 2020-21 and renewed more than 8,000 permits. The RTI was filed by Vadodara resident Paresh Gandhi in June initially to the state’s customs and excise department. The department however forwarded it to the health & family welfare department to answer. “The state government has not formulated any guidelines for health permits,” read the response by the assistant director (medical services) of the state health department on September 16. Paresh Gandhi said he filed the RTI application to know exactly which illness or diseases are covered by the state for granting liquor health permit. “It is surprising that the state has replied that there are no guidelines. They should have framed the rules or guidelines about the diseases or illness which are required for health permit,” Gandhi said. The liquor prohibition policy has existed since 1949 when the Bombay Prohibition Act was enforced. During a hearing questioning Gujarat’s prohibition policy in the Gujarat high court, the state government could not find the the statement of objects and reasons for enactment of the law. Sunil Kumar, director of the prohibition department, expressed his inability to identify diseases covered for permits. “We do strict scrutiny before giving the permit. But the permit can be recommended only by the medical panel of the concerned district,” he said. A Civil Hospital medical officer associated with the process said that till 2019, the list was long with insomnia, migraine, body ache and cardiac issues, etc. also cited as the reason to apply for the permit. “But afterwards, the norms have got stricter for both new permits and renewal of older ones. Currently, the ailments include asthma, anxiety, angina pain, chest pain, hypertension, and a range of cardiac issues along with hyperlipidemia,” he said, adding that the permit holder must be at least 40 years old. “Every application undergoes scrutiny both by the prohibition department and our staff. Annually, about 300-odd new applications are received for liquor permits at the hospital,” said Dr Rakesh Joshi, medical superintendent, Civil Hospital. Jai Prakash Shivhare, state health commissioner, was not available for comment. Meanwhile, permit holders told TOI that over the years, the procedure to get the permit has gotten more difficult, but not necessarily effective. “The application’s outcomes often depend on the whims of the medical officers, and it becomes a matter of public perception or choice rather than a valid procedure. Someone can get the permit on cardiac issues, whereas in other cases, the papers might not be sufficient,” said a Satellite resident on condition of anonymity. Under the current system, one permit gets the holder eight cans of beer or one bottle of liquor such as whisky.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/health-permit-for-booze-guidelines-bottle-empty-admits-guj-govt/articleshow/86517137.cms||Ashish Chauhan

According to sources, the step was taken after the Airports Authority of India (AAI) wrote to the district administration, informing it about an RT-PCR racket being run in Patna. The DM told this newspaper on Saturday that some flyers were producing fake Covid negative reports at the airport. “The AAI also suspects that the fake RT-PCR racket is being run with the help of some airport employees,” he added. The team, which comprises three members, has conducted a primary survey on the premises of the airport and talked to different sources as well. It will submit its report in a couple of days to the DM. “We are not sure why the airport authorities suspect that a fake RT-PCR racket is being run in Patna because our team has not found any concrete evidence in this regard. We have, therefore, asked the officials to share the fake reports with us so that we can find out where they originated from. If the allegations are true, strict action will be taken against the people involved in the racket,” Singh said. It is mandatory for passengers to carry a negative RT-PCR report before flying to Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and international destinations. Santosh Kumar, the Patna airport’s deputy general manager (air traffic management), also claimed that a few airlines had reported that some flyers travelling to these states were furnishing forged RT-PCR reports. “The hard copies of the fake RT-PCR reports as well as their PDF files looked real. However, when the authorities talked to the staff of the pathology labs concerned for confirmation, they claimed that the reports had not been issued by them,” Santosh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/team-to-crack-down-on-fake-rt-pcr-racket-dm/articleshow/86513640.cms||Faryal Rumi

The cyclone was in the form of a deep depression northwest and adjoining west-central Bay of Bengal on Saturday and it was moving west-north-westward. According to private weather agency Skymetweather, Cyclone Gulab may cross south Odisha and adjoining north Andhra Pradesh by the evening of September 26. According to a national bulletin issued by India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Saturday, the deep depression was moving westwards and situated about 410km east-southeast of Gopalpur in Odisha and 480km east-northeast of Kalingapatnam in Andhra Pradesh. “It is likely to intensify into a cyclonic storm during next six hours. It is likely to move nearly westwards and cross north Andhra Pradesh-south Odisha coasts between Kalingapatnam and Gopalpur by evening of September 26,” the IMD’s bulletin stated. Weathermen claimed that the impact of the cyclonic storm is likely to be primarily in Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Telangana and a few places in coast West Bengal as well. No weather warning has been issued for Bihar. An official at Patna Meteorological Centre said light to moderate rainfall occurred at one or two places in north-east and south-central parts of the state in the last 24 hours. The monsoon trough line was passing through Jaisalmer and Kota in Rajasthan, Sambalpur, Paradip and via north-east Bay of Bengal to the deep depression in central Bay of Bengal. “As a result of the weather systems in the region, light to moderate rainfall is likely to occur at a few places in Bihar over the next 24 to 48 hours,” the official said.

He added that sand would be available at the rates fixed by the government. Sand mining has been banned in Bihar for three months from July 1 to September 30. The minister told this reporter on Saturday that the department was planning to monitor the mining ghats through drone cameras, but the government had not given its permission yet. “The idea is to keep tabs on the illegal activities of the sand mafias operating in districts like Bhojpur, Aurangabad, Patna, Rohtas, and Saran,” he added. Earlier, chief minister Nitish Kumar had asked the authorities concerned to check illegal mining during a review meeting a few days ago. He had reiterated that stern action would be initiated against the officials having links with the mining mafias. Recently, the Economic Offences Unit had initiated action against 41 officials, including two IPS officers, for their alleged connection with the sand mafias. Sources said the sand of the Sone, Ganga, Gandak, Falgu, Kamla Balan, Kosi, and Parman rivers was usually mined. Meanwhile, the incidents of attack on police teams have increased in the recent past. The members of the illegal sand mafias had attacked a team from the Rampur police station in Gaya district on September 7. A home guard jawan, identified as Naurangi Mistri, was shot at and injured. Another incident took place in Saran on the same day when over 100 miscreants attacked a team of the district police, leaving several cops injured. Earlier, a joint team of the district police and the mining department was assaulted by sand mafia members in Banka district on September 1. “A constable sustained serious injuries in the attack,” a cop said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/resumption-of-sand-mining-to-bring-much-needed-relief-minister/articleshow/86514596.cms||Ramashankar

Talking to mediapersons, state panchayati raj minister, Samrat Choudhary, said the biometric technology was used during the first phase of the panchayat election on Thursday. He, however, admitted that there were certain problems at some places due to the usage of the biometric system for the first time. “But we hope there will be no problem from the next phase,” he added. Advocating the system, the minister said it was the best method to stop bogus voting in elections. Choudhary, who exercised his franchise at a polling booth under Tarapur block in Munger district on Thursday, asserted that the use of technology made the election process more transparent. Meanwhile, polling in Gaya, Aurangabad, Arwal, Jamui, Rohtas, Kaimur, Jehanabad, Nawada, Munger, and Banka passed off peacefully amid tight security arrangements.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ec-introduces-biometric-system-to-stop-bogus-voting-in-election/articleshow/86513806.cms||Ramashankar
---||Kolkata||Scholar, prof, students’ fav Swapan-da passes away||Kolkata: Swapan Kumar Chakravorty, celebrated as much for his knowledge of Jacobean drama and book history as much for his irreverence and sardonic sense of humour that made him immensely popular among students of several generations, passed away at a city hospital on Saturday. He was 67. He was suffering from Covid and had been hospitalized since September 1. He was subsequently declared Covid-free and moved to a non-Covid ward under ventilation, but by then, his lungs had been severely damaged. His wife, Bhaswati, too, had been hospitalized but she recovered and was discharged from the hospital. Swapan-da, as he was fondly called by his students, started teaching at Jadavpur University’s English department in 1985 and was the head of the department from 2005 to 2007. Chakraborty was as much known for his extensive and in-depth knowledge of textual criticism, Jacobean drama with special focus on Thomas Middleton, European Renaissance, early modern cultures and print cultures as his ability to mesmerise students. He graduated from Presidency College, did his post-graduation from Jadavpur University and DPhil from Oxford University. “I am heartbroken. Swapan was friend, family and colleague to both my husband and me for 50 years,” said Supriya Chaudhuri, Professor Emerita of JU. Ananda Lal, another retired faculty of JU, who was a year junior to Chakravorty at Presidency College, echoed her. “I am yet to come to terms with the reality of a loss like this. The English department at Presidency had very few boys and naturally, Swapan-da, as a senior, took me under his wings. This continued when we worked together at JU,” said Lal. The present head of the department, Sonia Sahoo, had Chakravorty as her MPhil and PhD supervisor and said she owed much to him as a student. It was Chakravorty’s interest in book history, a relatively new discipline today, that took him to National Library, where he served as the director-general. He also served as the curator of Victoria Memorial and the chairperson of Centre for Studies in Social Sciences. He was a member of the mentor group and Kabiguru Rabindranath Tagore Distinguished Chair Professor in the Humanities at Presidency University Grappling with grief, JU V-C Suranjan Das said, “I was a year senior to him at Presidency and a near-contemporary at Oxford. This is an intellectual loss for the state, but personally, I have lost a friend who would fret for me through every gherao I faced. He was the first one to congratulate me on my second stint at JU, asking me to be careful health-wise in these Covid times. Unfortunately, I have survived and he couldn’t.” Chakravorty is survived by his wife, also a renowned academician and a journalist, and son Saurya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/scholar-prof-students-fav-swapan-da-passes-away/articleshow/86517686.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

The initial target of vaccination had raised eyebrows as it was much lower than the number of voters in the city. The initial official vaccination target for the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) limits stood at 13,15,477. Going by this, the city has already achieved over 100% first dose vaccination as till Friday 13,29,562 persons had got the first dose. At the other end, 8,27,215 persons have been fully vaccinated so far. The initial target given to VMC was way off the mark as the city actually has 14,46,212 voters as per the data for the last civic polls. Officials say that this is a fair estimate of those eligible for vaccination. Even this is not an exact figure as many voters may not be staying in the city and many residents of the city may be voters elsewhere. “The target has been revised keeping in mind various factors. It may not be an exact number, but is a fair estimation. Our attempt has to be nearing that number as much as possible,” said VMC’s medical officer (health) Dr Devesh Patel. A source in the health department pointed out that there were bound to be anomalies in the number of persons vaccinated in the city too. “Many who are not residents or voters of the city took jabs here as they were working in the city when the drive began. Many from the nearby rural areas took jabs here as the vaccination drive started in the city before being rolled out in villages. “Also, many from the city took jabs elsewhere when it was difficult to book slots in the city,” said the source. He added that there were pockets that were added to VMC limits earlier, but were still being handled by the district panchayat’s health department. Patel pointed out that many have received the second dose too. With a high number of second doses being administered as compared to the first dose, it is expected that the percentage coverage of the second dose will also improve significantly in the coming day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/vaccination-target-revised-1-8-lakh-more-added-to-list/articleshow/86515301.cms||Sachin Sharma

Rickey Agarwal has bagged the 87th spot while Mayuri Mukherjee ranked 159, said course director Rajanvir Singh Kapur. Agarwal, who is from Siliguri, is a BTech in instrumentation engineering from IIT-Kharagpur. He is now posted in Indian Civil Account Service. He had been associated with the STCSSC since 2018. Mukherjee, a resident of Birati, said that she had a tough time juggling civil service preparations and preparing for her PhD thesis. Mukherjee did her Plus-2 at Belghoria Mahakali Girls High School and graduated with honours in botany from Presidency College in 2013. “Then I left for Delhi to do my MSc in botany from University of Delhi in 2015 and topped the university. I had an inclination for academics, but in Delhi, as many of my peers were preparing for the civil services, I also opted for it as a better career option,” she said. She added that this had been her third attempt. “As I was doing my PhD at Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, Jadavpur, managing time and priorities was tough. My supervisor, Sucheta Tripathi, understood my problem and helped me a lot. Without her support, it would have been impossible for me to crack the civil services examination. Jyotirmoy Pal Choudhury at the CSSC also mentored me. I enrolled with CSSC in 2019 for the classroom course and, subsequently, continued with the mains and interview guidance programme. The weekend-classes approach suited me as I could attend the classes alongside my research work,” said Mukherjee. “I got a good support system for the mains and the interview. The lectures delivered by IAS officers motivated me throughout my journey. Another important aspect was that our mains mock test copies were checked by IAS officers. That helped me boost my confidence. The mock interview and guidance at CSSC was incomparable, as senior officers took the interviews and this type of support would not be available at any private tutorial,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/iit-kgp-presi-graduates-among-upsc-top-200/articleshow/86517605.cms||---

---||Patna||20 RTI activists killed in Bihar since 2010||PATNA: At least 20 RTI activists have been killed in the state since 2010, including 10 in the last four years. The RTI Act had come into force in the country on June 15, 2005. The latest victim in the state was RTI activist Bipin Agrawal, who was killed at the entrance of Harsiddhi block office in East Champaran district on Friday. As per a Buxar-based RTI activist, Shree Prakash Rai, five activists were murdered in 2018, two in 2020 and three, including Agrawal, so far this year. He said one RTI activist-cum-former mukhiya, Praveen Jha, had died after being run over by an SUV in Banka on September 7. “Jha was involved in exposing corruption in public distribution system. We came to know that it was a PDS dealer’s nephew who dashed Jha when he was travelling on a bike,” he said. Before Jha, another RTI activist was murdered in Motihari earlier this year, Rai said. Last year, Pankaj Kumar Singh, who had launched a campaign against illegal sand mining in the state, was killed at Bikram in Patna on January 3. Another RTI activist, Shyam Sundar Kumar, was murdered in Begusarai on February 7, he said. Prakash said in several cases, government departments in the state take up to two years to replies sought under RIT Act. “When State Information Commission (SIC) was established in Bihar in 2006, replies used to come within a month. However, it takes months and, in some cases, years to get replies these days,” he said. The activist added there was a time when government officials would become restless after receiving RTI queries raised by common people. “Things have changed now. The fear has vanished among corrupt officers. They know well that no action would be taken against them,” he said. Another RTI activist, Ashish Ranjan, said activists are foot soldiers of democracy. “The RTI activists in the state are getting demoralised due to attacks on them and delay in getting information,” he said. He added the SIC should be more proactive. “Gone are the days when the state government used to focus on RTI Act. It used to organise trainings for public information officers for timely delivery of information. However, nothing is being done now,” he said. JD(U) spokesperson Dr Suheli Mehta said RTI activists should be protected. “Police should take strict action against those attacking or killing RTI activists. The state government doesn’t interfere in police works,” Mehta said.

This is the first time the TTD has released the SSD tokens online. When free darshan was revived at the Tirumala temple on September 9, it was noticed that a large number of pilgrims were congregating at the temple’s Srinivasam complex where the SSD tokens were being issued. To avoid pilgrim congregation at the complex, the temple body announced it would move the entire quota of 8,000 tickets per day under the SSD system online. Accordingly, 2.8 lakh free darshan tickets were released on the TTD’s website on Saturday morning and all got booked in just 30-odd minutes. TTD chairman YV Subba Reddy said the response was overwhelming. “We expected huge demand, but this was beyond our expectation,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/2-8l-sarva-darshan-tickets-booked-in-just-30-minutes/articleshow/86515111.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

The meeting will be held at Delhi’s Vigyan Bhawan where chief ministers of Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal or their representatives would speak in details about the Maoist scenario in their respective states, a Bihar government official told TOI. Nitish, sources said, would apprise the Union minister about the current scenario of LWE in Bihar and seek the Centre’s assistance in its fight against the Maoists. As per official records, currently only four districts in Bihar — Gaya, Aurangabad, Jamui and Lakhisarai — are Maoist-affected. Nitish, sources said, would also seek financial assistance for executing special development works in the LWE-affected districts. A similar review meeting on the LWE is convened every year by the Union ministry of home affairs. But the meeting could not be held last year due to the Covid-induced lockdown and other restrictions, the Bihar government official said. While addressing a similar review meeting on the LWE at Vigyan Bhawan in 2019, Nitish had said under the country’s federal structure, the Centre cannot relegate itself to “mere reviewing role” by throwing the ball in the court of states for taking effective action to neutralize the threat of the Maoists. “If effective steps in real sense are to be taken, mere discussion with state governments will not suffice. Centre will also need to take concrete steps. Financial grants will need to be continued for the schemes initiated earlier, such as Special Infrastructure Scheme and modernization of police forces,” Nitish had said in August 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/cm-in-delhi-may-seek-centres-aid-for-development-in-maoist-hit-dists/articleshow/86513760.cms||Madan Kumar

While state BJP president Dr Sanjay Kumar Jaiswal reiterated his party’s support to the Centre’s decision not to have the caste census, deputy CM Renu Devi, in an oblique reference to Tejashwi, said the latter was doing “vote bank politics”. Pointing out that the socio-economic and caste census (SECC), 2011, had thrown up a gigantic figure of the unmanageable 4.28 lakh caste identities in the country, Dr Jaiswal said a state like Maharashtra had only 484 registered castes, but the SECC (2011) had thrown up 52,000 caste groups. “Conducting caste census is neither practical nor manageable,” Dr Jaiswal said, adding the position of the central government, as explained in its affidavit before the Supreme Court, that the caste census cannot be conducted was fully justified. The deputy CM, on the other hand, maintained that she belonged to the extremely backward caste, and yet became a deputy CM without caste census. “I am the first woman deputy CM and also an icon on that account. Besides, I am also from the extremely backward caste. I could become deputy CM even without the caste census,” she said. Former CM and Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) leader Jitan Ram Manjhi pitched for the caste census. Manji’s party is in the NDA as a “partner” of the JD(U), which, however, has also been favouring caste census, but awaiting “positive response” from PM Narendra Modi. On his part, Manjhi echoed the JD(U) line, pointing out that a delegation of 10 political parties from Bihar led by CM Nitish Kumar had met PM Modi on August 23. Manjhi said if the amendment in the Constitution was required to give job reservation on the basis of the numerical strength of particular caste groups, it should be done and that there should be no cap on reservation quota.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tejashwi-doing-vote-bank-politics-bihar-deputy-cm/articleshow/86515569.cms||Abhay Singh

At the district-level monitoring committee meeting on Saturday, Patna district judge Sunil Dutta Mishra asked DM Chandrashekhar Singh and SSP Upendra Kumar Sharma to strengthen security at the civil court here. Patna public prosecutor Vijay Sinha, who was also present at the meeting, said, “The district administration has assured us of revisiting security measures at the civil and other courts where hand-held and door-frame metal detectors will be installed.” Sources said in the districts where the monitoring meeting was held, judges raised the issue of security on court premises. Bihar State Bar Council chairman Ramakant Sharma said they would soon write to Supreme Court, Centre and the state government to ensure safety of the lawyers. Senior lawyer Yogesh Chandra Verma said he would discuss the prevailing security measures at the Patna high court with chief justice Sanjay Karol as soon as he returns to the city. “The court will start physical functioning from Monday.

The daily average of PM 2.5 stands at 24 micrograms per cubic metre (ug/m3) in the city, according to the latest Air Quality Index. According to Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board (APPCB) data, the 2020 average of PM 10 annual mean stands at 55 ug/m3, which is 72% more than what the WHO demands and 63% more than the 2005 standards. However, when compared to National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), the city’s PM 10 annual average is only 27% higher. Experts point out that there is much difference between a lockdown-induced year like 2020 and a normal year like 2019. Track the pollution level in your cityHence, Vijayawada’s 2019 annual PM 10 average stands at 71 ug/m3, which is 43% higher compared to NAAQS and 78% more compared to WHO’s latest standards. Similarly, during 2019, the annual average of PM 2.5 concentration was at least three times above the WHO annual air quality guideline value. Speaking to STOI, APPCB junior scientific officer B V Prasad explained there has been a significant reduction in air pollution in the city owing to the healthy monsoon in the last two years and Covid-19 lockdowns and curfews. “A lot of meetings have been held in tackling air pollution. The more significant of them is installing more air quality monitoring stations in the city with a population above 1 million,” Prasad told STOI. On the bright side, other pollutants such as NO2 stand at 16 ug/m3, which is 63% lower than WHO’s 24-hour mean. Ozone, or O3, stands at 20% less than WHO’s eight-hour mean at 80 ug/m3 while the daily average for SO2 is 73% lower. Carbon emissions (CO) stand at a whopping 87% higher compared to the newly set WHO standards. Previously in 2005, WHO did not set CO standards. It has now kept the mean at 4.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/long-way-to-go-for-vij-to-meet-who-air-pollution-stds/articleshow/86515021.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti
---||Amaravati||Andhra Pradesh: Private bodies to be roped in for seigniorage collection||AMARAVATI: The state government is gearing up to hand over the responsibility for collection of seigniorage from mines to private agencies. The mines and geology department has readied a blueprint to invite tenders to rope in private contractors for the royalty collections segment. The final decision is likely to be taken after getting chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy’s nod. Sources said the mines and geology department has divided the 13 districts into six mining zones for auctioning seigniorage collections. The government has reportedly set Rs 2,900 crore as off-set price for all the districts. This is considered to be a nearly 90% increase from the revenues fetched during 2020-21. The state government had garnered about Rs 1,600 crore through seigniorage in the last financial year. Sources said the off-set price has been upped by almost 90% in view of the anticipated growth in revenues during the 2021-22 fiscal. The department has been studying the proposal to privatise seigniorage collections in view of the difficulties of field staff in effectively implementing rules. Taking advantage of inadequate surveillance and field staff, the miners were found to be evading huge amounts in the form of seigniorage, resulting in a massive loss to the exchequer. According to official data, 6,388 mining leases are operational in the state. Sources said outsourcing the royalty collection would help proper monitoring of mineral transportation, plug the potential leakages and collect taxes. However, the department would reserve the right to impose penalties on the violators even after privatisation of the seigniorage collections. “Privatisation of seigniorage will be done through transparent e-auction after fixing a reserve price payable to the government. This concept will help the department in utilising its resources to control illegal mining and transportation more effectively, besides ensuring higher revenue collections to the exchequer,” said a senior official in the department. Interestingly, the state government has also decided to e-auction minor minerals from which the department is expecting to pocket around Rs 500 crore. About 21,500 hectares would go under the hammer for grant of minor mineral quarry leases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/pvt-bodies-to-be-roped-in-for-seigniorage-collection/articleshow/86515068.cms||Samdani MN

He shares his mantras of success with Faryal Rumi in an interview. Excerpts: How did you feel after declaration of results?I never expected to top the exam, but always believed in my hard work. Securing top rank in the civil services exam is completely a different feeling. I am still surprised. Who inspired you to pursue civil services?My father and other family members inspired me to go for civil services. The way my parents raised me despite being in the village was an example for others to follow. This inspired me to work for the welfare of rural people. I had attempted civil services exam for the first time in 2018 after graduating from IIT-Bombay. The serious attempt was in 2019 after one-and-a-half-year of preparation. I had secured AIR 290 in 2019. Whom did you call immediately after declaration of results?I spoke to my father first and told him that I have topped the exam. He could not believe it initially. What is the secret of your success?In my third attempt, I limited my syllabus and sources of information. I took leave from training to write the papers. During the training in Pune, I prepared for the interview round. Can you tell us about your background?I come from a rural background and my father, Devanand Singh, works at Uttar Bihar Gramin Bank and mother, Punam Kumari, is a homemaker. I live in a joint family. My father always ensured that I never faced any kind of hardship. He spent about 50-60% of his income in the studies of myself and my sister. What are the facilities that the state government should provide to civil services aspirants?The state is already providing cash incentives to the IAS aspirants preparing for the mains exam. But I think that if there is a dedicated institute in Bihar to help civil service aspirants, it would go a long way in helping them. Your message to the aspirants?They should be confident and mingle with only such people who can give them positive energy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/i-want-to-work-for-welfare-of-countrys-rural-people/articleshow/86513704.cms||Faryal Rumi

After being on fast without water for more than 24 hours, how would the women reach their polling stations and exercise franchise is a question haunting the candidates and the administration both. An official, however, said the enthusiasm of voters, particularly women, is so high that they would exercise their franchise come what may. “As large number of women candidates are in fray, they are expected to persuade the women to come out even during the fast,” the officer said. Many women candidates will also observe the fast meant for well-being of their children. A woman candidate for mukhiya in Benipur block said the State Election Commission should devise ways for bringing the fasting women to polling booths.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/jitiya-may-hit-turnout-of-women-voters-in-darbhanga/articleshow/86513778.cms||Binay Kumar Jha

Recently, Biju threatened Shahi Mohan of Mayavilasam, Kovoor, Mynagappally, and his relative for not paying Rs 10,000 for constructing a martyr’s memorial and Rs15,000 for purchasing land for a temple administered by Biju. He threatened them of placing a party flag in front of the convention centre that Shahi was constructing at Mughammoodi Mukku, Chavara. In a release issued to the media on Saturday, CPM district secretary S Sudevan said the branch secretary should not have committed such an act that would bring disrepute to the party. District committee would conduct a probe into the incident, the release said. Though the party leadership reluctantly suspended Biju, till Saturday evening the district leadership was justifying the branch secretary’s act. There was an attempt to depict the incident as fabricated. The leadership said that Shahi was voluntarily offering the contribution to get the party’s favour when the branch secretary objected to reclaiming 26 cents of paddy land adjacent to the convention centre. Shahi is a welder and his wife Shini a day-care centre employee in the US. They availed loans from KFC and from their employers in the US to mobilize Rs 10 crore for the convention centre. Shini had filed a complaint with chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan seeking his intervention. CPM state leadership’s and chief minister’s strong stand against the branch secretary’s acts forced the district leadership to initiate action against Biju.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/threatening-expat-investor-cpm-suspends-branch-secretary/articleshow/86516504.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The external affairs ministry formally informed the Bengal government of its decision on Friday, triggering a typical Mamata outburst in which she dared the Centre to “stop me”. “I am not eager to visit foreign countries, but this was about the respect of the nation. This government goes on talking about Hindu interests. But if it really has Hindu interests at heart, why deny the only Hindu woman representative from India permission (to go there)?” she said, pointing out that all other invitees to the event were Christians and Muslims. “I was going to represent India, it was not a vacation,” Mamata railed at her bypoll campaign in Bhowanipore. “The Italian government had given me special permission. Several heads of state and religious leaders are going to be present at the event and I was the only Indian invited.” The CM questioned why she had been barred from going to events abroad “whenever I want to go but you all (BJP leadership) can travel as you please”. In 2018, Mamata didn’t get clearance to attend a Chicago event that was meant to mark 125 years of Swami Vivekananda’s historic speech at the World Parliament of Religion. A proposed trip to China before that had to be cancelled at the last minute because the Centre didn't allow her to go. All official foreign trips by CMs require the external affairs ministry’s nod. Mamata’s visit to Rome for the proposed event — “Peoples as Brothers, Future Earth” — was scheduled for October 6 and 7. The formal invitation had arrived on July 22, mentioning “her contribution to the cause of social justice and her commitment to the underprivileged and the disadvantaged”, officials said.

The seer’s body was found hanging from a ceiling fan at Baghambari mutt premises in Prayagraj on September 20. On September 6, the seer lodged an FIR with Daraganj police, alleging that a fake twitter account had been created in his name to peddle lies. The 18-member special investigation team (SIT) formed by the UP government had begun probe into the cyber fraud before CBI took over. Now, the mahant’s signatures in the police complaint are being used by CBI to match those in the suicide note, recovered from his room where his body lay. In the FIR, Giri had alleged that an unidentified person had created a fake twitter account in his name and was spreading misinformation. “I was informed by my associates that I was active on twitter. But, I want to reaffirm that I have not created any account and an unidentified person was spreading lies by using my name,” the seer stated in his complaint to Daraganj police. An FIR was registered against unknown persons for dishonesty, cheating by impersonation and under Information Technology Act. Sources in SIT, said they sought details on the real account holder from Twitter as this will give vital clues on those harassing Giri.

The ward has administered both doses to 4,000 people and was awarded a certificate of appreciation by the Pocharam municipality recently. Confirming the same, municipal commissioner A Suresh said, “Till yesterday, nobody had declared 100% vaccination in the entire state, we have checked the records. They started vaccinating healthcare staff and frontline workers in January this year and completed the vaccination in the last week. It was declared as 100% vaccinated.” The ward, which is adjacent to IT campuses of Infosys and Genpact, largely houses IT employees and senior citizens, many of whom stay alone. “Of the 10,000-plus population, nearly 6,000 IT employees of Infosys are in their hometowns since the pandemic struck. The remaining 4,000 adult population largely consists of senior citizens. Many of them are elderly women staying alone. Since this area mostly has a population of educated people, convincing them was not a problem but logistics had to be arranged. As soon as vaccines were made available at the nearest primary health centre at Narapally in March, we began taking the people to the primary health centre for vaccination,”said B Hariprasad Rao, 12th ward councillor, Pocharam municipality. “We also took some people to AIIMS Bibinagar and later to the Annojiguda community hall centre. In the last 10 days, the remaining 520 people were vaccinated in the community hall itself,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pocharam-ward-1st-in-t-to-achieve-100-vaccination-with-both-doses/articleshow/86516550.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Hyderabad||With no town planning, Secunderabad Cantonment Board fails to push back squatters||HYDERABAD: Of the many civic issues that residents of the Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB)-controlled areas claim to be reeling under, land encroachments is among the most pressing. This, owing to the lack of a town planning department, they say. In the absence of such a wing — unlike the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation — there is no dedicated team to check illegal constructions or encroachments in the cantonment area. Even complaints to the SCB often go unnoticed due to this gap, residents said. A look at SCB’s official records show that there are about 10,000 properties built on encroached land within Cantonment limits. Topping the charts is Rasoolpura followed by Mudfort, Bowenpally and Trimulgherry. According to officials and locals, majority of these encroachments are on open nalas, footpaths and open lands — mostly occupied by vendors. In a recent drive, the SCB engineering wing removed nearly about 30 to 40 encroachments from Vasavi Nagar behind Karkhana old police station, but residents say that it’s not enough. “The problem is way more widespread. But unfortunately, there is no accurate assessment of properties standing on encroached land. Recently, the SCB decided to levy property tax on such buildings, to improve its revenue, but that is unlikely to resolve the bigger problem that arises from this illegality — disappearing nalas. Most of these encroachments have either come up on nalas and open land parcels. The latter could have been used to develop infrastructure of the area,” said Moses Prasad, a resident of Bowenpally. Activists allege that though the issue has become so severe, SCB officials have been turning a blind eye to it despite repeated complaints. “They have no plan to set up a separate town planning wing since it is not mentioned in the Cantonment Act. In the absence of that, there is a designated department available to address complaints or monitor such illegalities. There is also a lot of corruption while collecting taxes as there is no competent authority to keep a watch,” claimed Chandrasekhar Sankaran of the Open Secunderabad Cantonment Area Roads (OSCAR) group and resident of Alwal. Due to the lack of a town planning department, many also said that Cantonment residents have to depend on the principal director, defence estates for final approval of building plans — making it a cumbersome procedure. In comparison, within GHMC, it is the town planning department’s chief or the municipal commissioner who is the competent authority. The process is also faster, residents claim. “We do not know what the procedure will be if the merger happens but as of now, we have identified a few encroachments and demolished them. In some cases, we have given them notices. Pertaining to building permissions, the applicants should fill up the forms and get NOC from the airport authorities before the application is referred to the board. The entire application process is still manual in SCB,” said Gopal Krishna, SCB engineer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/with-no-town-planning-scb-fails-to-push-back-squatters/articleshow/86516544.cms||Moulika.KV

In a treatment room in Surana Hospital, Malad, she swallowed the capsule (containing the balloon) that was attached to a tube-like structure. Five minutes later, on ascertaining through X-ray that the capsule was settled in the stomach, bariatric surgeon Mohit Bhandari introduced 550ml of fluid through the tube into the balloon (the vegan capsule melts away). “There is now a 550ml balloon in the patient’s stomach,” he said. The balloon is meant to induce weight-loss by increasing satiety and reducing the amount of food eaten. The swallow-a-pill innovation takes 15 minutes and costs Rs 3 lakh. Intra-gastric balloons have been around for 15 years as a weight-loss technique, but they have to be inserted using an endoscope in a hospital and under general anesthesia. “This American innovation takes away the need for hospitalisation, anaesthesia or endoscope,” said Dr Bhandari. Four months on, the balloon will deflate and be excreted, and the patient could have lost 15% to 20% of their weight. Dr Bhandari, who is based out of Indore, recently got certification for the Elipse Gastric Balloon from Spain and has implanted it in over 50 patients in the city, Delhi, Indore, Jaipur and Chennai. “In Europe, thousands have opted for this,” he said. On Thursday, he implanted the balloon in three patients in the Malad hospital. One of his first patients was an Indore colleague, pulmonologist Ravi Dosi, who weighed 104 kg on September 14 when he underwent the procedure. “I didn’t need to take leave or change my routine much. I am down to 96 kg,” he said . Bariatric surgeon Aparna Govil-Bhasker said any innovation that is easier on patients is welcome. “Such an innovation is one more tool in a bariatric surgeon’s kitty,” she said. Still, balloons are viewed as a temporary solution. “The biggest problem with weight loss is regaining it,” said Govil-Bhasker. “Balloons can only help patients to an extent. Bariatric surgery remains the best treatment for morbidly obese people,” said Dr Bhandari. Lifestyle changes work best for patients with a BMI between 23.5 and 27.5. Surgical options work for patients with a BMI of over 32.5. Doctors believe Elipse balloons would click for the BMI 28-32 group. Bariatric surgeon Muffazal Lakdawala said the side-effects are the same as those with any gastric balloon. “Patient may feel nauseous and vomit in the first week. A very small number could experience abdominal pain for longer,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-a-balloon-trick-to-make-stomach-feel-full-help-you-reduce-weight/articleshow/86518681.cms||---

Critical cases of the vector-borne disease have been reported over the last one-and-half month. According to sources, there has been one dengue death every day for the last two weeks at Niloufer Hospital. “Delay in initiation of treatment or hospitalisation is proving fatal in some cases, as we are daily seeing dengue deaths due to dengue myocarditis, dengue shock syndrome and encephalitis, bleeding tendencies, severe dengue. In many cases, patients are reaching later than two days of fever which can be extremely dangerous in cases of severe dengue. We are seeing one to two deaths each day due to dengue,” said a doctor at Niloufer Hospital, the largest tertiary centre for children. In one instance, 11-year-old Hajeera Sultana from Rajendra Nagar developed sudden breathlessness and vomiting while undergoing treatment at a local clinic. She was shifted to Osmania General Hospital where she succumbed the same day she was moved. “She was confirmed to have had dengue by the clinic and OGH. We were told we brought her late and her condition had deteriorated a lot. Her red blood cells were less,” said Mohammed Haleemuddin, a relative of the girl. In many cases, delayed presentations such as breathlessness, bleeding after the fever subsiding and taking unsupervised medication is leading to further complications. “This time, we are seeing that dengue is causing real trouble in kids below one and those above 10 who are overweight. We have seen deaths in 10-year-olds with body weight of 55-60 kilos,” informed Dr Parag Shankarrao Dekate, clinical director paediatrics and head of paediatric intensive care at Kims Cuddles. Dr Parag explained that in kids below one, hyper response to the disease leads to liver, brain and kidney issues while in obese children over ten, haemoconcentration (internal dehydration) leads to multi-organ failure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/most-dengue-deaths-in-state-of-infants-below-1-obese-kids-over-10/articleshow/86516564.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Vastrapur hospital told to pay Rs 1.17 lakh to patient||AHMEDABAD: A consumer court has ordered a hospital in Vastrapur to pay Rs 1.17 lakh to a patient after the plate implanted in his right hand, following multiple fractures, broke, forcing him to incur expenses for a new plate. According to case details, Ambawadi resident Siddharth Panchal sustained multiple fractures in his right hand in a car accident on May 25, 2011. He was admitted to Sanjivani Hospital, where a surgery took place and a plate and bolt were implanted. Four months later, Panchal felt pain and an examination revealed that the plate was broken. He was advised to get a new implant. He consulted another doctor and underwent surgery for the new implant, for which he had to pay Rs 1.17 lakh. Panchal sued the hospital and its two doctors with the Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission, Ahmedabad (Rural) in 2012, but it dismissed the complaint in 2013 saying that the company, which had manufactured the plate, was not impleaded as party respondent. Panchal approached the Gujarat State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission. After hearing the case, the commission said that this is a clear case of ‘res ipsa loquitur’, the principle that the mere occurrence of some types of accident is sufficient to imply negligence, and therefore the burden is on the hospital to prove that there was no negligence on its part. Normally, biomaterials like eye lenses, stent, plates pacemaker are purchased by hospitals because a patient being a layman has no knowledge about the quality of such material. In this case, the hospital had purchased the plate which broke and the patient had to spend again for another surgery. Besides, asking the hospital to pay for the expenditure incurred for the second surgery, the commission also asked the hospital to pay Rs 10,000 to the patient towards legal expenditure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/vastrapur-hospital-told-to-pay-rs-1-17-lakh-to-patient/articleshow/86516546.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Engineering colleges break merit rule, irk students||HYDERABAD: Engineering students seeking admission in B-category (management quota) have hit a roadblock as many private colleges have stopped receiving applications. This, despite the Telangana government instructing the colleges to keep the application window open till October 5. As per the admission rules, 70% of the seats fall under A-category or convener quota and the remaining 30% seats fall under B-category seats or management quota. Seats under the B-category are filled based on engineering, agriculture and medical common entrance test (Eamcet), joint entrance examination (Main) score or intermediate marks. As per guidelines stipulated by the Telangana State Council of Higher Education (TSCHE), these seats have to be filled by the management on merit by duly notifying them. However, students rue that private engineering colleges are informing them that the seats under B-category have been filled. “In some colleges, I was informed that the seats are already filled. How can they fill these seats without even notifying them,” said a student. Members of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) represented the matter to the Telangana State Admission Fee Regulatory Committee (TAFRC). “All colleges must give notification through newspapers and give a chance to students to apply for it. Thereafter, they must submit the list of admissions to the higher education council for rectification. But not all colleges are following this norm,” said Thota Srinivas, ABVP Telangana state technical cell convenor. The TAFRC has received many such complaints from students and has warned colleges of the same. “There have been allegations by certain students and student organisations that private professional colleges are not receiving applications of certain students for admission under B-category. Consequently, they are losing the opportunity of joining private professional colleges and candidates who are less meritorious are getting the opportunity,” read a notification issued by the TAFRC. Following complaints from students, the TAFRC has decided to consider students applications and forward them to the respective colleges. “Students whose applications have been denied by institutions for admission can submit their applications along with required documents to us by October 1. Admissions under B-category are subject to ratification by the TSCHE and they will be thoroughly scrutinized to check if the merit rule has been followed,” said Justice Swaroop Reddy, chairman, TAFRC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/engg-colleges-break-merit-rule-irk-students/articleshow/86516584.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad School Parents’ Association moves HC on school fee regulatory mechanism||HYDERABAD: Stating that the government was merely giving directions to private schools on reducing fee during the pandemic and washing its hands of the matter without setting up a mechanism to ensure the implementation of the same, Kadapa Venkata Sainath of Hyderabad School Parents’ Association (HSPA) has filed a public interest litigation in the high court urging it to ensure the setting up of a regulatory mechanism to regulate school fee in private unaided schools in the state. Though the state had issued GOs asking the private schools to collect only tuition fee and not insist on other components, the schools never implemented these GOs, and ironically, the state never bothered to check, he said. “Schools have now found the innovative definition of the word tuition fee because they are including all other components of fee in it. They are not giving any break up of these particulars as was done earlier. They are calling the whole thing tuition fee,” he said, calling it as a circumvention of the orders of the courts and the state. Though the state was under an obligation to examine the affairs of all private schools against whom complaints were received, the state had conducted an inquiry into 11 schools only and stringent action was not taken even in those cases, where the guilt of the schools was established. Stating that keeping in place an effective regulatory mechanism seems to be the sole solution for now, the petitioner urged the court to direct the state to bring in such a mechanism. He also informed the court about the recommendations made by professor Thirupathi Rao Committee on reforming schools and the state’s inaction. The report was not placed before the state legislature until now, he said, seeking directions to the state to act on them now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hspa-moves-hc-on-school-fee-regulatory-mechanism/articleshow/86516609.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Thiruvananthapuram: Containment zone at Kallar ward a blessing for PWD||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The sudden closure of Ponmudi and Kallar ecotourism centres after Kallar ward being declared as containment zone may have been disappointing news to many. But, the officials of the public works department (PWD) believe that the lockdown could not have come at a better time as they could peacefully carry out the maintenance works at the Ponmudi road that suffered damages during the monsoon rains in the month of June. The PWD officials concerned said they will be commencing works on Monday. The lockdown has come just at a time the PWD awarded a work order of Rs 24 lakh to a contractor for the repair of the road. It was by July last week that the government gave administrative sanction for the works, following which the department floated a tender for awarding the contract. “We will be trying to complete the works as fast as possible, trying to finish them before the hill station is reopened to the tourists,” said a senior official attached to the Nedumangad sub division office. The road had suffered damages following incessant rains the hill station received in the first week of June. The road between hairpin curves 11 and 12 suffered maximum damages at several spots due to soil erosion. This resulted in depressions forming on the road surface. The rainwater kept seeping in through the gaps formed by erosion, posing a risk of caving in of the road. Besides this, crash barriers at hairpin curves 18 had also collapsed during the rain. The district administration acted quickly and banned entry of tourists to the hill station to avoid potential tragedies. However, the district administration opened the place a few weeks later after the monsoon season got over. This was also done after assessing the Covid situation in the district. The hill station has been witnessing huge crowds during weekends, it being the favourite weekend destination of the domestic tourists here. Last Sunday, the road to the hilltop witnessed several accidents after over 5,000 tourists thronged the place. The heavy traffic along with strong rains resulted in accidents, prompting the police and forest authorities to introduce regulations to keep the crowd under control. This includes opening a new ticket counter at Anappara forest checkpoint in addition to the existing ticket counter at Golden Valley checkpoint. They are also considering introducing an online ticket booking platform to regulate the crowds. However, a day ago the authorities decided to close down the tourist spot after Kallar ward in Vithura panchayat, which is the entry point to the destination, was declared as containment zone due to rise in Covid cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/containment-zone-at-kallar-ward-a-blessing-for-pwd/articleshow/86516616.cms||Rejith Balakrishnan

The directions were issued on Friday to keep the canal and the river Khari it is a tributary to, pollution free, as there were total 169 outlets identified by which polluted water was discharged in the river. After few directions issued by the tribunal to salvage the ecology, the authorities informed it that 161 outlets were sealed, treated wastewater was discharged in three outlets and the work was under progress for the remaining five outlets. The NGT, New Delhi, was concerned over pollution of Khari and Sabarmati rivers, which have already been placed in the list of polluted rivers. It has ordered the Gujarat Industrial Development Corporatiton (GIDC), the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) to work in coordination with local police “to keep vigil and install CCTV camera to monitor such illegitimate action”. The canal’s maintenance work is to be monitored by the chief secretary. The NGT has ordered GIDC and GPCB to report about work progress to the chief secretary by January 15, 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/install-cameras-along-kharicut-canal-ngt/articleshow/86516582.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Shoppers, craters make weekend traffic crawl in Kolkata||KOLKATA: As the skies cleared up, albeit briefly, and before the next heavy spell of rain could hit the city, citizens thronged shopping hubs and markets on Saturday, throwing traffic out of gear and triggering concerns over the spread of the novel coronavirus, especially since a third wave of the pandemic is feared soon. The battered roads, with their potholes and cracks, added to motorists’ woes. The sea of shoppers, coupled with cratered roads, brought the weekend evening traffic virtually to a grinding halt as long serpentine queues of vehicles waited near Hatibagan in the north, Gariahat in the south, New Market in the centre as well as near malls, like South City, Acropolis Mall and Quest Mall as thousands of buyers walked down the streets, heavy shopping bags in hands and masks either hanging at their chin or tucked inside pockets. Stretches like, SN Banerjee Road, Lenin Sarani and JL Nehru Road, all near New Market and Lindsay Street, were chock-a-block with cars, which were stranded on the road for several minutes at a time as shoppers negotiated their way to and from New Market, Lindsay Street and and Sreeram Arcade. Such was the situation that traffic cops across several guards called for additional manpower to tackle pedestrian movements. “We had thought of going shopping after lunch on Sunday. But with a rain forecast for Sunday, we shifted the plan to Saturday. I went to Gariahat and my husband joined me on his way back from office,” said Gargi Dasgupta, a resident of Bosepukur in Kasba. Vehicles going in and out of malls also led to jams, while inside, food courts as well as all the major retail hubs brimmed with people. Officials at most malls said Saturday’s footfall easily surpassed the count recorded in the past few weekends. If the throngs of buyers were not enough, the crater-like potholes that have surfaced on even thoroughfares now after the torrential rain earlier this week slowed down traffic even further. “The downpour has wreaked havoc on the already-battered roads. The condition of the majority of arterial roads, which were listed for an urgent repair before the Pujas, deteriorated after the heavy spell. Even the patchwork on some thoroughfares has been washed away. Another spell of heavy rain will make it even more difficult to repair the roads,” said a senior official of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation’s roads department. The official cited the example of the 5km Chittaranjan Avenue, where large stretches needed urgent repairs, keeping in mind the safety of commuters. TOI drove around the northern parts of the city to find stretches near Ram Mandir, Jorasanko and Medical College and Hospital in extremely poor state. A KMC roads department official pointed out they had set a deadline for patchwork on CR Avenue. “But now, we will have to wait for the fresh spells of rain and then, make our final plan,” a KMC civil engineering department official said. Traffic crawled even on E M Bypass, which has been riddled with ditch-like potholes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/shoppers-craters-make-weekend-traffic-crawl/articleshow/86516682.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

He said that since the last seven years, Upadhyaya’s dream of ensuring the reach of the benefits of welfare schemes to the most deprived persons of the society is coming true under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “The inspiration behind Antyodaya Anna Yojana and many other public welfare schemes implemented in the country to benefit the most underprivileged people of the country is Pt Deen Dayal Upadhayaya. He was very clear that the base of any welfare scheme shouldn’t be rich and prosperous people but the last man of society. Now, his dream is coming true,” said the chief minister. Praising the welfare schemes brought and implemented by the PM, Yogi said, “PM Modi ran many welfare schemes in the country such as house and toilet for every poor family, free LPG gas connection to poor women, and health cover up to Rs 5 lakh under Ayushman scheme. The benefits of such schemes are not given after looking at the religion, caste, area and face of people. People are being benefited without any kind of discrimination. The Central and the UP governments are trying to attain the goal of empowering the most deprived and bringing happiness in their lives.” Yogi said that many programmes in the aftermath of the outbreak of Covid-19—the time that saw more deaths due to hunger than disease—are testimony to the humane and welfare-oriented approach of the government. “Free ration scheme is one such example and the entire world has seen it. Around 80 crore people in the country and 15 crore in the state benefited from it,” he said. “Pt Deen Dayal Updhyaya defined the humane face of the government in 1950. It seems that the then government didn’t take it seriously, but his dream is being fulfilled after seven decades under the leadership of PM Modi,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/pm-has-fulfilled-pt-deen-dayal-upadhyayas-welfare-dream-cm/articleshow/86516010.cms||Neha Lalchandani

---||Varanasi||PM Narendra Modi's gifts to US vice-president Kamala Harris, Australia PM Scott Morrison boost Kashi’s Gulabi Meenakari art||VARANASI: US vice-president Kamala Harris would have no idea who Kunj Bihari Singh is, but must have been delighted to receive a beautifully handcrafted gift, a chess set made of Gulabi meenakari, from Prime Minister Narendra Modi during their meeting in the US on Friday. This exquisite gift was handcrafted by Kunj Bihari, a master artisan and national award winner of Varanasi, the parliamentary constituency of Modi. Considering a deluge of orders for such chess sets after the PM’s gesture, local experts believe that it would go a long way in reviving this exquisite art form of the region. During his US visit, the PM reportedly presented the chess set as gift to Harris. Besides, he also gifted a Gulabi meenakari ship to Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and a sandalwood Buddha statue to Japanese Premier Yoshihide Suga. “The Kashi’s craft of Gulabi meenakari got international recognition after the PM presented the artifacts to the world leaders,” an elated Kunj Bihari told TOI on Saturday. “Since then, orders are pouring in from different parts of the country and abroad, and I have received the order of 25 chess sets,” he said, adding that the PM’s positive gesture towards the Kashi craft would definitely help revive this art after the Covid-19 setback. On demand, he himself had left for New Delhi on September 19 to hand over the crafts to the authorities, he said. While Kunj Bihari has crafted the chess set, his brother Tarun Kumar, who is also a national merit awardee, has created the ship. The Gulabi meenakari or pink enameling of Banaras joined the coveted Geographical Indication (GI) club in 2015. “The presentation of this craft at the international level by the PM would boost this art globally,” said the GI expert and president of Human Welfare Association (HWA) Dr. Rajani Kant, who facilitated many crafts to get GI certification. This is the global branding of GI-tagged Indian crafts by the PM and would boost the prospects of Indian art and craft, he said. Gulabi meenakari of Banaras is a unique art form. It is considered as the most alluring and technical of all metal decorations. The National Museum of India, New Delhi and Bharat Kala Bhawan, Banaras Hindu University have collections of this art. According to the specification given in the GI notification, Banaras Gulabi meenakari is basically an ancient form of art in India that has been praised since its introduction for the superb designs and combination of colours. It is characterized by pink strokes on white enamel. Unlike the vibrant enamelling in red, green and blue of Jaipur and Delhi, where the white enamel is left stark, the Varanasi craftsmen delicately add pink to the predominant white enamel. The motifs have been lotus blooms and buds. It is said to have been introduced in Varanasi by Persian enamellists who had come to India in the early 17th century at the peak of Mughal court. It is a unique craft in which meenakars (artisans of enamelling) make items like religious figures of gods and goddesses on silver and gold sheet, various types of traditional ornaments and decorative items, motifs, including flowers and birds and animals on gold and silver metal. Late Rai Krishnadas, founder director of Barat Kala Bhawan, had also written that Banaras stands next to Jaipur in the art of enamelling and the nature of Banaras pink is similar to Jaipur red. In the 19th century and early 20th century, pink enamel was famous throughout the country and was much sought after by princes and the aristocracy. Unlike the red enamel of Jaipur, which has still maintained the high quality and fine workmanship of the 19th century, the pink enamel of Banaras was short-lived. It ended here in the first quarter of 20th century when its last hereditary master Babbu Singh passed away in 1923. After a gap of about half a century, there has been a revival of pink enamelling in Banaras, chiefly as a trade to meet the demands of tourists and of women, who have taken to old jewellery more as a fashion than out of love for its charm and grace.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/pms-gifts-to-harris-morrison-aboost-for-kashis-gulabi-meenakari/articleshow/86515912.cms||Binay Singh
---||Kozhikode||3 years on, flood relief yet to reach eligible persons in Kozhikode||KOZHIKODE: Several beneficiaries eligible for immediate assistance of Rs 10,000 after the 2018 floods are yet to receive the assistance in Kozhikode taluk. The delay has occurred even as an inquiry report by a senior finance officer had found that Rs 53 lakh allotted as relief amount had gone into the accounts of ineligible persons. According to an official source, most fund diversions happened as the assistance was provided at least twice to the same beneficiary in many cases. A total of around Rs 53 lakh got diverted through this gross error in the distribution system. Now, each beneficiary who received double the eligible amount will have to be served notices to return the money. What makes the error graver is that several eligible people are still awaiting the assistance. Azeez Ilambilasssery, a resident of Pazhur Chathamangalam, says that he has been running from pillar to post to receive the benefit for three years. “My house was completely inundated in the floods. The water level had gone as high as 10ft and it continued to be like that for at least three days,” said Azeez. He said that he had gone to offices at least half a dozen times to get the relief. “Sometimes they say that the address is not correct and I have even corrected the spellings in the forms. I went to the office several times over the past three years and after a point I gave up,” he said. He added that those who did not get the benefit were in fact the ones who were most affected by the floods. According to sources, the assistance was provided to 22,360 beneficiaries in Kozhikode taluk and the inquiry report has recommended the retrieval of the said funds from those who got it twice. At the same time, another diversion was also found out during the probe. An official with the revenue department was suspended after it was found that he had diverted the fund to his relative’s account. “The total assistance was Rs 10,000 for each person. The directive was to give out this emergency assistance to the affected persons even before they reach their homes back from the relief camps. While the issue of the double crediting was investigated, an irregularity of around Rs 97,000 was found. It came to the attention that the funds went to the account of a relative of an official. Action was initiated against him. The amount was returned soon after a notice was issued,” said the source. An investigation is now on into the delay in the distribution of relief funds worth Rs 1.17 crore as well. “The fund was not distributed due to errors in IFSC code, account number, etc. The amount which did not go to the real beneficiary is now in the treasury suspense account. This indicates that there are more beneficiaries who are eligible to get the assistance but it needs to be confirmed through an enquiry. Since, a claim has not been made for the past three years, the veracity of the claim has to be verified now before processing the distribution,” said an official source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/3-years-on-flood-relief-yet-to-reach-eligible-persons-in-koz/articleshow/86516690.cms||---

The BMC received 3.5 lakh vaccine doses from the state government on Saturday and plans to hold mega drives on the first three days of the week, said BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani. Public vaccination centres are closed on Sundays. On the first only-women drive held in Mumbai on September 17, more than one lakh women took the Covid shot. The city’s vaccination statistics bear out the need for such special drives. While the city has vaccinated over 80% of the population with at least one dose, there is a big gender gap among the recipients. According to data available on the Cowin portal, almost 70 lakh doses in Mumbai have been given to men while only 52 lakh doses have been given to women so far. Moreover, with the possibility of schools reopening next month, teachers and school staff have to be fully vaccinated. ``Many of the staff of the BMC schools have been vaccinated, but the special drive will provide quick access to teachers from private schools as well,” said Kakani. Students who are over 18 years of age will also be able to walk in for vaccination at the public centres in the first half of Tuesday. On Saturday, due to limited stocks (before fresh stock was transported), public centres in the city only vaccinated 14,916 as compared to five-digit figures on some days. In all, 75,980 people were vaccinated on Saturday, including 58,822 in private centres in the city. In Maharashtra, 6,22,366 people took the vaccine on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/spl-vax-drive-women-teachers-students/articleshow/86518709.cms||---

While passing the above directive, the court directed that the petitioner shall be allowed to continue in the employment of the Commission in the manner as was being done earlier during the pendency of the petition. Hearing a writ petition filed by one Mahaboob Ali, Justice Ashwani Kumar Mishra directed to list this case after the expiry of period of two weeks. The petitioner was engaged as a computer operator/clerk on the contractual basis by the Commission in the year 2011. Subsequently, the Commission started making efforts to engage him as an outsourced employee of a contractor. Appearing on behalf of the petitioner, his counsel Tanisha J Monir argued that the petitioner had been working satisfactorily for the last 10 years. However, on September 2, 2021, an order was passed by the Commission, which compelled the petitioner to join as an outsourced employee of a contractor. The court after hearing concerned parties observed, “Prima facie, this court finds no good ground for the Commission to compel the petitioner to function as an outsourced employee of a contractor engaged subsequently by the Commission." The court while staying the order of September 2, 2021, asked the state government as well as commission to file their respective replies in the case within two weeks and directed to list the case after the expiry of a period of two weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hc-seeks-govt-hesc-reply-in-staffers-matter/articleshow/86516086.cms||---

They have been created based on the quality of ideas,” the CEA said while addressing participants at the ISB PGPMAX Leadership Summit 2021. He stated that the reason the startup economy was gasping for breath earlier was because of crony lending and the crony policies that were pursued till then. “The policies since then, whether it is the bankruptcy code, GST, demonetisation that has created the entire digital economy, labour market reforms, farm bills, enterprise policy focused on the private sector….all of them are about enabling competition in the economy,” he added. As per Venture Intelligence data, India has 65 unicorns, of which 25 have been added in 2021 alone. Of these 25 new Unicorns, 10 are from Bengaluru. Subramanian also pointed out that under the current regime, private players are being empowered and except for three to four strategic sectors such as defence and oil & gas, the rest all are being opened to the private sector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/policy-push-boosted-startups-led-to-spurt-in-unicorns-cea/articleshow/86516627.cms||Swati Rathor

---||Allahabad||Prayagraj RRB, 20 others to be closed & integrated with NTA||Prayagraj: The Railway Recruitment Board (RRB), responsible for conducting examinations and recruitment for the Indian Railways, would soon be a thing of the past. The RRB would be integrated with the National Testing Agency (NTA), which would conduct examinations and recruitments thereof for the Railways. This follows the recommendations of the principal economic advisor, Sanjeev Sanyal. The recommendations have already been approved by the ministry of finance. A letter to this effect has been sent to the Railway Board which in turn has sent the same to all the zones of the Indian Railways, including North Central Railway (NCR). The Railway Board has been instructed to keep the ministry informed about the progress made in terms of implementing the recommendations on 5th of every month. Following the implementation of the recommendations, all the RRB spread across the country, including the one at Prayagraj, would cease to exist as it would integrate with NTA. The recommendations (copy of which is with TOI) reads, “The recommendation made by the principal economic advisor mentions that the Railway Recruitment Control Board (RRCB) was established in 1998 to coordinate and streamline the working of various railway recruitment boards. Given that the government has set up a national testing agency which would conduct a common preliminary examination for various recruitments in the central government, there is no need for separate RRBs. It is therefore recommended to integrate the 21 RRBs and the existing infrastructure under NTS apex authority. The railway may conduct its exam via the NTA. There may be a small digital office in the railway to coordinate with NTA.” One of the RRBs has been located at Prayagraj since its inception in 1998. Commenting on the recommendations, chief public relation officer (CPRO) of NCR, Dr Shivam Sharma, said, “Such a letter has been sent to all the zones of IR including NCR and we are studying the content and the reply would be sent to the Board as and when required.” However, the employees union of NCR has condemned the content of the letter. Zonal general secretary of Men’s Union, R D said, “The government is fast moving towards massive privatisation. RRB was made functional to maintain total transparency in the recruitment in IR and now as these entities are being closed down, it is nothing but opening a gate for corruption. North Central Railway Men’s Union will oppose this proposal in every possible way,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/prayagraj-rrb-20-others-to-be-closed-integrated-with-nta/articleshow/86516102.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Vadgam MLA Jignesh Mevani set to join Congress on September 28||GANDHINAGAR: Jignesh Mevani, the dalit activist and independent MLA from Vadgam, Jignesh Mevani, will join the Congress on Tuesday, along with former JNU student leader Kanhaiya Kumar. Mevani is expected to get a role at the national level in the party’s organisation. Mevani came into the spotlight when he spearheaded protests by the dalit community across the state after the infamous Una dalit flogging incident in 2016. He has been a champion of dalit rights and has been instrumental in securing possession of land for more than 10,000 dalits across the state. Mevani confirmed that Kanhaiya Kumar and he would join the Congress later this week. “On September 28, I will be joining the Indian National Congress along with Kanhaiya Kumar.” He added, “I got a proposal from the INC. I have met Rahul Gandhi on several occasions and have high regard for him and the Congress party’s ideology and vision for the country,” Mevani said. “I am joining the Congress as it will give us more strength in fighting the BJP in the coming elections in Gujarat, other states and the Lok Sabha elections in 2024. I have no expectations from the Congress except full freedom to fight the BJP my own way,” Mevani added. With Mevani’s induction into the Congress imminent, the three young Turks of Gujarat politics – Hardik Patel, Alpesh Thakor and Jignesh Mevani – will have all aligned with the two major political parties. Riding on caste and community-based agitations, Patel, Thakor and Mevani shot to the political centrestage ahead of the 2017 assembly election. Hardik Patel subsequently joined the Congress and is now a working president of the state unit. Thakor joined the Congress and won the 2017 assembly elections on a Congress ticket. He was lured away by the BJP ahead of the 2019 general election and quit the Congress, only to lose on a BJP ticket in the byelection. Mevani opted to contest the 2017 election as an independent. He won the Vadgam assembly seat with the Congress’ support and continued to support Congress-led activities inside and outside the assembly. A top Gujarat Congress leader confirmed Mevani’s joining. “Mevani has been associated with the Congress in the house and outside as well. The central leadership also wants that young leaders like him help the party counter the BJP, not just in Gujarat, but nationally. He is likely to be given national-level posting and an assurance of his candidature for the Vadgam assembly seat,” the leader said. “We welcome all revolutionary youths who are willing to work for the development of the country and strengthen the Congress party and the ideals of Gandhi, Sardar and Nehru,” Hardik Patel said in a statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/vadgam-mla-mevani-set-to-join-congress-on-sept-28/articleshow/86516684.cms||Kapil Dave

Known for her activism through songs and poetry, Bhasin started her journey in 1970 by participating in social movements in Delhi and Jaipur. She always maintained her ties with Jaipur where did her schooling from Maharani School, Chaura Raasta, and later graduated from Maharani’s College. She briefly worked as a teacher in Kanoria College before heading to Germany to study economics. She returned to work at Sewa Mandir in Udaipur and was known as ‘motorcycle wali’ in Udaipur as she rode a mobike. “She played a vital role in shaping a national narrative against the glorification of Sati in Rajasthan in 1987. Without her contribution, the rape case of Bhanwari Devi would never have led to the Vishaka Guidelines,” said Lad Kumari Jain, former chairperson of state women rights commission. Kavita Srivastava of People’s Union for Civil Liberties considered closest to Bhasin remembers her as a motivator. “She championed the cause of gender equality in entire South Asia. The movement ‘One Billion Rising’ (OBR) resonated across the globe and is seen as one of the biggest movements in recent history,” said Srivastava, who organised a prayer meet at Vinoba Gyan Mandir earlier in the day. The prayer meeting was attended by several women activists including some who had studied with Bhasin. She founded Jagori, an NGO, that worked for resource and documentation of women issues in the ’80s while forming the NGO South Asian Network Gender and Framing (SANGF) in the ’90s, working for gender equality in the south Asian region. “I offer my condolences on the demise of rights activist and author Shrimati Kamla Bhasin. She was educated in Rajasthan and worked tirelessly for the rights of women here. Her efforts have paved the way for the rights of women in South Asia,” tweeted chief minister Ashok Gehlot||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/feminist-rights-activist-kamla-bhasin-no-more/articleshow/86518743.cms||---
---||Bhopal||85% vaccinated in Madhya Pradesh, but less than 75% in some districts||BHOPAL: While 85% of eligible population in Madhya Pradesh has been vaccinated for Covid so far, there are few districts where the coverage is less than 75% even for the first dose. Among the districts with lowest coverage are Sidhi and Bhind. In these districts, only around 74% and 72% estimated eligible people have been covered as on September 24. However, officials claim that there are several issues in the districts and the gap is not much wide. In Sidhi district, officials said that at least 20,000 people have been identified who have been vaccinated but there records could not be updated. The data is being updated now, they said. “We have an estimated target population of 7.8 lakh in Sidhi district. As per our surveys, 69,000 are those who have migrated to other places, 10,000 were rehabilitated. When the records were checked, it was found that around 20,000 have been vaccinated but their records could not be uploaded,” district collector Sidhi, Mujiburehman Khan told TOI. “Several ares are remote and have connectivity issues. In such areas, people are vaccinated, their records are updated in registers and then the vaccination teams move to places where there is connectivity to update the data. When we verified, there are 20,000 people who have been vaccinated but their records are not found online. However in registers the records are available, it will be rectified soon, so that people do not face issues with second dose vaccination”, he said. Thus overall as vaccination is still going in the district, we will have a gap of only around 30,000-35,000 which we will cover in next two days, the officer added. In Bhind district, a gap is visible but there are around 2 lakh people who have migrated to other places, officials said. The remaining who are in the district will be vaccinated in next two days, they said. In Singrauli district too an estimated 1 lakh people are to be vaccinated. Officials in the district claim that actually there is no such gap. “We are conducting survey of people who have migrated outside, or those who are having severe illnesses. Then mostly students from the districts also migrate. We will get exact figures by tomorrow and will be carrying out extensive vaccination” collector Singrauli, Rajeev Ranjan Meena told TOI. As on September 25, around 85% of the estimated eligible population in the state is vaccinated. Sources said that the complete data of people who have migrated to other places from districts is not available yet. September 26, or Monday will be observed as vaccination “mega drive”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/85-vac-in-mp-but-less-than-75-in-some-dists/articleshow/86516667.cms||Amarjeet Singh

Further, they have requested the government to undertake registration of Kambala buffaloes through the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI). Former general secretary, District Kambala Committee, Mulikar Kanginamane Vijay Kumar, told TOI that a memorandum was submitted recently to minister for Kannada and culture V Sunil Kumar, sports minister Narayana Gowda, and animal husbandry minister Prabhu Chauhan. A delegation led by P R Shetty, president, District Kambala Committee, has requested financial support for the promotion of the sport. The kambala season begins from mid-November, and goes up to March, and around 22 events are held. “Along with promoting the sport at the international level, we are looking at protecting the buffalo breed that is used for kambala. Kambala buffalos are of the Thalavara and Gauli breeds and live for around 28 years. They are able to participate in kambala for about 21 years. During transportation of the buffaloes for the events, owners should abide by the law of animal transportation, and should have valid certificates. We request the government to grant 10,000 sq ft for a cow shed, and 25 acres of gaumala exclusively for kambala buffaloes. This should include five acres by the riverside to maintain kambala buffaloes, and land to develop medicinal plants,” Vijay Kumar said. The committee wants the government to issue guidelines through the formation of the Karnataka State Kambala Authority. “We want everything to be documented henceforth, including registration of the jockeys. Kambala jockeys should be recognised like any other sportsperson, and should be entitled to jobs, travel concessions, pension and scholarship. Further, organisers must ensure that there is sufficient water and fodder arrangement at the event. Also, from this year, we will insist that a team of three veterinarians must examine the buffalo, and the related documents, before the kambala festival begins.

While readying himself for the last stage of the gruelling UPSC examination, Aditya tested positive in April. Having nobody to take care of him, the 25-year-old thought his dreams of becoming a civil servant had shattered. When he was unable to find a bed for himself in any hospital, he sent an SOS message on a WhatsApp group devoted to interview preparation guidance, and Maharashtra bureaucrats came to his rescue. “When all my hopes were lost, they came forward like angels. They not only arranged for a bed in the national capital, but also ensured I was taken care of,” said Aditya, recalling the dreaded days. With little time left after recovery, the feisty lad strove hard and emerged with flying colours. Three others, namely Ashuman Yadav (rank 242), Subodh Mankar (rank 684) and Devwrat Meshram (rank 713) have also cleared the coveted civil services exam from Chandrapur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-battered-chanda-boy-cracks-upsc/articleshow/86516730.cms||Mazhar Ali

There is a pressing need to operate a train from Vasco-Da-Gama (Goa) to Kanyakumari. At present no direct daily overnight train service is available between Kanyakumari and northern part of Kerala and Dakshina Kannada region which includes Mangalore, Karwar and Goa, said S R Sreeram, association president. Kanyakumari is frequented by foreign tourists and Goa is yet another place of interest. But these tourists intending to travel from Kanyakumari to Goa and vice versa suffer because of the absence of a direct daily train, said P Edward Jeni, secretary of the association. At present the Pune–Ernakulam weekly express train is in operation in the name of Poorna Express.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/extend-pune-ekm-train-to-kanyakumari/articleshow/86516728.cms||---
---||Pune||Covid third wave will not be as severe as second: Virologists||PUNE: The third wave of Covid-19 was unlikely to be as severe as the second and India was now in the endemic stage of the disease, eminent virologists said. Dr Gagandeep Kang, a member of the Covid-19 working group and a professor at Christian Medical College, Vellore, told TOI that she could not really see a large third wave in the next couple of months with the existing variants. But, she said, there could be small waves limited to certain geographies. “Delhi, in all probability, had four waves. A wave is an increase in cases followed by a decrease in a relatively short period in a defined geography. We are unlikely to see a sharp spike in cases in the third wave as in the case of the second wave because of lower number of susceptible people and no new variants,” she said. Kang said she was not saying that there would not be a third wave even with the existing variants, but it would be a smaller one in smaller geographies. She said earlier there were lot of infections and large number of people fell sick because everyone was susceptible. “Now, with fewer susceptible people, there would be an increase in infection without an increase in people getting sick. This is a decoupling between the infection and the disease because of people being protected from severe disease owing to prior infection or vaccination,” she said. Explaining the endemicity, Kang said an endemic was a disease that was consistently present at high or low frequency, which might differ in different geographies. “Given that the virus has been there for more than 18 months with two-third of the population already infected by June/July and the continuing cases, we can reasonably say we have reached the endemic stage” she said. Kang said a rise in number of cases even in an endemic disease hinged on environment conditions and behaviour changes. Seasonal fluctuations, too, affect an endemic disease. “So, according to epidemiology, we have achieved the endemic stage, where we live with the virus in the background and there is a possibility of some increased prevalence depending on local conditions and behaviour,” she said. Jacob John, another eminent virologist, echoed Kang. “We are in an endemic phase with steady numbers without many ups and downs for the last 12 weeks or three months — July, August and September. A third wave is very unlikely in 2021. A wave requires a susceptible population of a certain size, which is currently insufficient. The most recent serosurvey confirms that a large proportion of the population is immune,” he told TOI. He said a wave in near future was possible only if a new variant more transmissible than Delta emerged, but it would be small because the pool was not large. “No such variant is known now. We are also increasing vaccination. So, the next wave will be delayed until the population size of susceptible individuals grow large enough,” he explained. Epidemiologist Giridhar Babu said the interpretation of terms such as endemicity was bound to be subjective and it needed clear definitions to track the next phase of Covid-19. “Recommendations from the Universal Health Preparedness Review advisory group are awaited. It is in the stage of formation by the World Health Organisation, who can potentially address this,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/covid-3rd-wave-will-not-be-as-severe-as-second-virologists/articleshow/86516695.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Before this, only one village in Mandsaur district had got the tag so far. As per the Swachh Bharat Mission, ‘ODF Plus’ village is one which “sustains its Open Defecation Free (ODF) status, ensures solid and liquid waste management and is visually clean”. “We are hopeful that by October 2, we will have at least 100 ODF Plus villages in our state,” mission director, Swachh Bharat Mission (rural), Nidhi Nivedita told TOI. This being done under the second phase of Swacch Bharat Mission that is being carried out between 2020 and 2025, before 2020 there was first phase of Swachh Bharat Mission, where ODF was priority, now sustaining it along with other aspects like ensuring solid waste management, liquid waste management, ensuring the village plastic free, makes it ODF Plus. Before the 14 villages of Bhopal, it was only one village of the state, Dhaloda Chaupati in Mandsaur district which has been declared ODF Plus so far in the state.

---||Mumbai||Three-day heavy rain alert in Maharashtra from tomorrow||MUMBAI: A yellow alert has been issued for Mumbai, Thane and Palghar for September 27-29, after IMD Mumbai forecast thunderstorms and heavy rain. Officials predict thunderstorms accompanied by lightning, gusty winds and heavy rain at isolated places, caused by a deep depression in the Arabian sea which intensified into cyclonic storm ‘Gulab’ over the Bay of Bengal. IMD scientist Shubhangi Bhute said that the system is likely to move nearly westwards and cross North Andhra Pradesh-South Odisha coasts by Sunday evening . “Under the influence of the above system, few parts of Maharashtra like Vidarbha, Marathwada and North Madhya Maharashtra are likely to get heavy to very heavy rainfall and strong gusty winds on September 26, 27 and 28. Konkan is likely to receive heavy to very heavy rainfall (isolated places) with strong gusty winds,” said Bhute. Mumbai and its adjoining areas fall under the Konkan region. The IMD has also issued a warning for fishermen along the North Maharashtra coast, as winds reaching up to a speed of 45 -50 kmph and gusting up to 60 kmph are expected to prevail. Meanwhile, the city on Saturday witnessed dry weather conditions, with the IMD observatories recording no rain. Total rain recorded in the city so far has been 2,984.2 mm, which is 824 mm above normal. The total stock in the lakes supplying Mumbai’s needs have also crossed 99% capacity, or 14 lakh million litres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-3-day-heavy-rain-alert-from-tomorrow/articleshow/86518813.cms||Richa Pinto

For instance, in T Nagar, the proposed flyover at Ranganathan Street which will end just before Anna Salai on the CIT First Main Road will be connected at the other end with the existing flyovers on North Usman Road so that motorists from Anna Salai can drive up to Mahalingapuram/Loyola College on a continuous freeway. Similarly, north Chennai is also set to get a similar grid with the Strathans Road-Konnur Road flyover, Ganesapuram flyover and the Stephenson Road flyover. “Motorists will need to drive only 800m on the road. The rest will be on these flyovers. This has been done to improve the traffic situation in north Chennai,” said a senior GCC official. The Ganesapuram flyover, Stephenson Road bridge and the flyover at Ranganathan Street till Anna Salai are the ones on which work has started after it was sanctioned in the just-concluded budget session. The idea of grid type flyovers is an offshoot of a question that local administration minister K N Nehru raised with GCC officials a few months ago in a review meeting. The minister asked for proposals to build expressways in the city limits, so that people don’t need to wait at traffic signals. Though the officials said implementation of an expressway in city limits would be difficult due to land acquisition issues, the grid of flyovers would be something close to it. In the T Nagar grid, GCC would have to connect the north Usmaan flyover with the one that connects Mahalingapuram with another flyover. “The project will be planned soon. Land acquisition will be minimal as the construction will happen parallel to the road,” the official said. GCC is also planning to partner with Chennai Metro rail so that they can have a flyover-cum-elevated line akin to the construction at Vadapalani. Such grid type flyovers will save a lot of time for motorists and also cut pollution at junctions, the official said. Another advantage is that in case these areas witness metro rail construction, traffic congestion can be resolved as a major part of the traffic would be able to move on the flyover.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/civic-body-plans-freeways-in-city-with-grid-flyovers/articleshow/86516734.cms||Siddharth Prabhakar

He urged UDF to withdraw from opposing the project. “A few have concerns over this project since they will lose their land and properties. But I can assure you that all the concerns would be addressed in the best possible way. A comprehensive rehabilitation package will be in place if the government takes over the properties for this project,” he said. “The government cannot withdraw from a project just because of unnecessary criticisms. The K-Rail project is going to be an integral part in the development of the state. This project has been designed with very limited displacement of people,” he added. “Hence the opposition should shed their criticisms and join hands with the government to make it a reality,” said Vijayan. Grievances of pravasis Vijayan said officer on special duty Venu Rajamony had discussions with officials of the external affairs department on issues faced by pravasis in the wake of the pandemic situation. The difficulties they faced for getting tickets had also come up for discussion. External affairs department has developed a special scheme for placements and now Norka will be joining hands to help Keralites seeking jobs in Japan, said the chief minister. He said the government could mobilise Rs 500 crore for the pravasi chitti. So far, 1,13,000 pravasis have registered for it. This scheme will ensure a safe future for them and will also help in the development of the state, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/no-going-back-on-k-rail-project-cm/articleshow/86516788.cms||---

The victim, Sagar Waghmare from Khulewadi in Chandannagar, died owing to multiple head injuries, police said. Truck driver Ramesh Sathe (24), from Sutarwadai in Pashan, was arrested by the police on the charge of causing the biker’s death due to negligence under section 304(a), among other charges, of the Indian Penal Code and the Motor Vehicles Act. Senior inspector Gajanan Pawar from Lonikand said, “Investigations revealed that Sathe and Waghmare were heading in the direction of Pune from Wagholi. The truck transporting iron rods stopped for a while on Azadnagar Road at Wagholi around 7am for taking a right turn. Waghmare, coming from behind at high speed, lost control of the bike and crashed into the protruding iron rods.” Pawar told TOI, “The impact of the incident was such that the skin of his face had come off after his bike skidded after crashing into the iron roads. He was not wearing helmet.” “Waghmare was proclaimed brought dead by the doctors on arrival at the Sassoon general hospital. The hospital in its post-mortem report certified the cause of the victim’s death due to multiple injuries,” he added. Sub-inspector Shrikant Temghire, said, “We had received information that the iron roads had hit the biker while taking a turn. But investigations revealed that the biker was at fault. We have taken action against Sathe because he did not exercise caution while taking a turn. The accident could have been averted had he taken precautions.” Sr PI Pawar said, “Transporting iron rods cannot be permitted if they are protruding outside the length of vehicle. The truck driver, driving in dangerous condition, failed to take safety measures like displaying red light/red cloth, indicating dangers to vehicles coming from behind.” Waghmare’s family could not be contacted because his mother passed away a few days ago, his father is undergoing treatment in a hospital and his sister has sustained injury to her hand in an accident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/motorcyclist-crashes-into-protruding-iron-rods-dies/articleshow/86516808.cms||Asseem Shaikh

The crime branch produced Bonito before a court which sent him to judicial custody. The city police’s crime intelligence unit (CIU) had earlier this year filed a 400-page chargesheet against Chhabria in the same case. Chhabria is accused of taking over Rs 5 crore from Sharma to design a vanity van, which was not delivered. During the probe, Bonito’s name also came up. The crime branch called him for questioning on Friday and consequently, arrested him. Sharma had lodged a complaint with the police in January this year. He told the police that between May 2017 and May 2018, he had paid Rs 5.3 crore to Chhabria for the vanity van. In his statement to the cops, Sharma said that Chhabria then further demanded Rs 40 lakh for GST, which he had paid. Chhabria then sent the parking bill of the vehicle to Sharma, despite the vanity van not being ready. This is when Sharma approached the economic offences wing (EOW) and submitted a complaint. The EOW conducted a preliminary inquiry and the case was transferred to the CIU, which registered an FIR. The beleaguered car designer now faces three cases at the crime branch, including two other ¦ complaints of cheating.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-automobile-designer-dilip-chhabrias-son-arrested/articleshow/86518851.cms||---

The government is now ensuring that every family affected by a Covid-19 death is aware of the scheme. It is also assisting them in applying for financial aid. From Saturday, the government started reaching out to the affected families through its call centre. Also, a pool of around 3,300 officials of the revenue department would now visit the addresses of each of the 25,085 deceased people according to the list of health departments to inform their family members about the scheme and assist them in applying. “To ensure that information regarding the scheme reaches all the affected families, Delhi government decided to use services of its call centre and the process of reaching out to all potential beneficiaries started today,” Delhi’s revenue minister Kailash Gahlot told TOI. The revenue department has also deployed 10 executive magistrates to guide the call centre executives on all days, including holidays, he said. Gahlot said that 3,300 revenue officials at SDM level were already deployed for home visits for verification and collection of documents, if needed. “Delhi government has now decided that the officials will also visit the address of each person who has succumbed to Covid-19 to inform the family about the scheme and assist them in filing the application form,” he said, adding that they have been directed to complete the exercise within seven days. “I recently met some affected people who were not aware of the scheme. Then I understood that in the event of a death, the family is in mourning for a long time and we should reach out to them,” the minister said. Apart from the one-time financial assistance, families that lost a breadwinner are also provided a monthly pension of Rs 2,500 each. The state government had received 10,436 applications under the scheme till September 17, out of which more than 5,000 applicants have received Rs 50,000 each and 1,188 beneficiaries are receiving Rs 2,500 under the monthly assistance scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/official-visits-to-help-kin-of-covid-victims/articleshow/86516795.cms||Sidharatha Roy

This has now given more ammunition to the critics of CAP, who say it’s high time the education department scrapped the process. CAP is conducted by the state education department and is the sole gateway for admissions to junior colleges affiliated to the state board. However, it is applicable only to the 215-odd junior colleges in the city whereas outside NMC limits, admissions still take place the old-fashioned way. Here, students directly approach the college and complete admission formalities. A senior principal, who did not wish to be identified, said students in the city are losing out. “Our CAP is wrapping up at the end of September, which means the start of the academic session is delayed. Koradi is just a 15-minute drive from my college and academic session started in July there. The sole reason is that CAP is not applicable there. It’s such a stark difference within 15-20 minutes of driving distance,” said the principal. Ravindra Fadnavis, a school’s trustee and a vocal critic of CAP for many years, said, “I just do not understand why we have CAP if there is no dearth of seats. Logic suggests that CAP comes into play when there is shortage of seats and, hence, admissions must be done on the basis of merit. But here, we are now staring at almost 30,000 vacant seats, so it’s time to rethink the process.” Ashok Gavhankar, general secretary of Vidarbha Junior College Teachers’ Association, has already written to education officials and demanded scrapping of CAP. Gavhankar said, “In junior colleges within the city, or anywhere in our region, there is no need for CAP. Let every college offer online admission through it’s website, thus eliminating the need for the student to run from college to college.” CAP is conducted in certain urban centres, with Nagpur and Amravati being the only ones in Vidarbha.

Delhi government’s transport department has initiated a drive to impound “end of life” vehicles and send them for scrapping. The Supreme Court had, on October 29, 2918, prohibited the plying of 15-year-old petrol and 10-year-old diesel vehicles in the national capital. Similarly, a 2014 order of the National Green Tribunal also prohibits vehicles older than 15 years to be parked in any public area. In the first phase of the drive, enforcement teams from the department would seize diesel-run vehicles that are more than 15 years old and deregistered for scrapping. Delhi’s transport commissioner Ashish Kundra told TOI that the department has been issuing a series of public notices to draw attention of people to the legal position of the pliability of the vehicles. “Diesel vehicles that are beyond 10 years old and 15-year-old petrol vehicles cannot ply and as per the scheme (guidelines for scrapping of motor vehicles) notified by the department, they can’t even be parked in a public street,” Kundra said. Kundra added that the idea behind the drive was not to take a “repressive” measure, but send the message across to owners of such vehicles. “The law is laid down and is very clear, and the idea is to drive home the point that these cannot ply and to take action,” the commissioner said. “Our teams would go out and do surveys. We have data from our database and have worked out a strategy for the first phase of action,” the official added. “We are serious about the environmental aspect and are aware that the most polluting of the lot are diesel vehicles. So in the first instance, we will take action on diesel vehicles that are more than 15 years old,” Kundra claimed, adding that the department would also encourage people to get their vehicles scrapped on their own simultaneously. “We have already had consultation with authorised scrappers and the details will be displayed more prominently on the website now,” he said, adding that there is a fair value of the vehicle that is assessed per kg with the scrap value deposited in the owners’ account, after deducting towing charges. The transport commissioner said there are many people who want to get their old vehicles scrapped but might not be feeling the urgency or are not aware of the process. “This is why we are issuing public notices,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/diesel-vehicle-15-drive-starts-to-send-it-for-scrapping/articleshow/86516780.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan to felicitate Tokyo Olympics women hockey players||BHOPAL: Fulfilling his promise to the members of women’s hockey team who reached the semis of 2020 Tokyo Olympics, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan will present a sum of Rs31 lakh each to the players. A function will be organized on October 8. FIH president Narendra Batra and other hockey authorities will be a part of the felicitation ceremony. After the Indian women reached the last four stage of the Tokyo Olympics, Chouhan had announced that the state government will felicitate the team for their extraordinary performance. Despite not winning a medal, the team performed brilliantly by booking a slot in the semifinal and defeating three-time champion Australia 1-0. Even in their bronze medal match against Great Britain, India was leading 3-2 in the first round. However, Great Britain slowly turned the game around and claimed a 4-3 victory winning the bronze medal. Despite defeat in the bronze medal match, several rewards and recognition were announced for the Indian women’s hockey team as their performance put India back on women’s hockey map. Sports department officials said that hockey federation authorities will be a part of the felicitation. After assuming the charge of international hockey federation (FIH) this will be the maiden visit of Narendra Batra. Indian women's hockey team's Tokyo Olympics coach Sjoerd Marijne had also thanked CM Chouhan for announcing Rs31 lakh for the team members. The coach, who has stepped down since from his position, described the announcement as a “beautiful recognition and gesture for our team”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/cm-to-felicitate-oly-women-hockey-players/articleshow/86516800.cms||Ramendra Singh

The police said that the body of the man, who is assumed to be around 45 years old, was found by local residents lying in the plantation near Thannimoodu Devi temple near Kilimanoor. Some of the local people said that the deceased was a mental patient who was often seen loitering in Thannimoodu area and nearby localities very recently. But no one knew his actual identity or his whereabouts. The police also said that the cause of death was also unknown. Though an inquest procedure was conducted, the police could not find any injury marks on the body of the deceased. They suspect that the death could have happened either due to natural reasons such as illnesses or through poisoning. The actual reason could be found only after a post mortem examination, the police said. The body has been shifted to the mortuary of Thiruvananthapuram government medical college hospital. A covid screening test and post mortem examination will be conducted on Sunday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/unidentified-man-found-dead-at-rubber-plantation/articleshow/86516791.cms||---

After being released, Rajesh Pavithran told the media at Patrika Bhavan here on Saturday, that he is the president of ABHM-Karnataka, and Dharmendra, a co-accused in the case, is its state general secretary. ABHM-Karnataka is a political party registered in 2015, and Dharmendra was one of the eight candidates in the assembly elections of 2018, he said. Further, he claimed that he filed a complaint on August 23, seeking an inquiry into the misuse of ABHM name. He stated that another complaint will also be filed in the court. Meanwhile, in another press conference, complainant L K Suvarna, reiterated that Pavithran and Dharmendra were expelled from the state committee posts. “We have no links with those who went to jail after holding press meets in the name of Hindu Mahasabha,” Suvarna said. The city police had on September 18 booked a case at Barke police station, against eight people, based on a complaint filed by Suvarna. The complainant had claimed that the accused, despite being expelled from the organisation, were holding press conferences by misusing the organisation’s letterhead. Further, he sought action against those who held the press confrences for threatening the chief minister, the former chief minister and others over the demolition of a temple at Nanjangud in Mysuru district. Following this, Pavithran, Dharmendra and others were arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/accused-claims-to-be-mahasabha-chief/articleshow/86515034.cms||---

The DoE stated that it had received several requests from parents and urged the board to waive the examination fee for students studying in government, New Delhi Municipal Council and government-aided schools, among others. In a letter to the CBSE chairperson, DoE director Udit Prakash Rai said: “The pandemic has created an economic crisis, shuttering business and cutting jobs around the world.

---||Ahmedabad||NBFC auto loan ticket size up 21%||Ahmedabad: Fuelled by the rising prices of cars and two-wheelers, and more people opting for financing for vehicles, the average ticket size of automobile loans rose in 2020-21, even though demand was hit. In Gujarat, the average ticket size of automobile loans extended by non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) surged by 21% during the pandemic year, up from Rs 5.08 lakh in 2019-20 to Rs 6.15 lakh in 2020-21, according to data from the RBI-approved credit bureau, CRIF High Mark. Even though vehicle sales were muted during the pandemic year, the average ticket size of automobile loans by NBFCs was the highest for the five-year period since 2016-17. Industry experts, dealers and NBFC players attribute this to the higher prices of vehicles. Umesh Revankar, managing director and CEO, Shriram Transport Finance Co. Ltd, said, “With the technology change in automobiles after the BS-VI rollout, price of cars rose by 15-20%. Moreover, with higher steel prices, most manufacturers have increased their prices. This mades vehicles more expensive by at least 20-25%. If prices have gone up, the average ticket size of vehicle loans is bound to go up.” NBFC experts say a preference for mid-sized cars is also rising. “After the pandemic hit, there is a shift in preferences of people buying cars. People want bigger cars for families as public transport was closed for a long time and from the point of view of safety. More people are opting for cars that are mid-segment and above, instead of entry-level cars. The ticket size has therefore increased,” said Mahesh Thakkar, director general, Finance Industry Development Council (FIDC). “As market sentiment improved, demand for cars was good but most people who opt for financing are avoiding bigger down payments while seeking loans and are making minimum payments,” said Pranav Shah, chairman, Gujarat region, Federation of Automobile Dealers’ Associations (FADA).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/nbfc-auto-loan-ticket-size-up-21/articleshow/86516824.cms||Niyati Parikh

---||Delhi||Delhi jails are on high alert: DG lists out measures, vigil on gang members||NEW DELHI: A day after Delhi’s most wanted gangster Jitender Maan alias Gogi was shot dead at a Rohini court, the director general (DG) of prisons, Sandeep Goel, sounded an alert at all the three jails: Tihar, Mandoli and Rohini. In a letter signed by him, Goel said that maximum alert should be maintained at all three places to prevent any incident of assault or fight amongst rival gangs. Eleven major points on security at the prisons have been outlined in the letter. These include proper briefing of jail staffers and maximum deployment inside the prisons. Gogi was allegedly shot dead by members of the gang of Sunil Tajpuria alias Tillu, his arch-rival for a decade now. His hearing at the Rohini court was scheduled for the morning but was delayed and shifted to the end of roster, keeping in mind his very-high-risk category assessment. Goel has recommended that proper precautions should be taken while taking inmates of these gangs to courts, hospitals or anywhere else outside the prison. Advance information should be sent to senior officers about any such movement and any unnecessary movement of such inmates inside or outside the jail must be avoided, says the letter. “Proper security should be provided wherever these inmates are allowed to move inside the jails for video-conferencing, inmate calling system, canteen etc. Discrete efforts should be made to develop an intelligence network for collecting information from among the inmates so as to prevent any untoward incident. All superintendent of jails should keep maximum presence in the jail and should inspect the jails at odd hours also,” the DG, prisons, said. Apart from this, all security equipment should be in working order, medical officers and paramedical staff should be deployed in sufficient numbers to handle any emergency situation, security personal should be on high alert and ready to report for duty at any time and inmates of rival gangs should be identified and they should not be let out at the same time, if lodged in the same jail, cautions the letter. Meanwhile, Delhi Police beefed up the security arrangements at the Rohini district courts on Saturday. Only vehicles with stickers were allowed inside. A senior police official said adequate personnel have been deployed inside and outside the court to ensure no untoward incident takes place in future. He said concerns have been raised about functioning of metal detectors in the court premises and the matter has been taken up with the court administration. Currently, there are 23 metal detectors, out of which only 13 are working. The court complex has nine gates, out of which three are closed, five are manned by Delhi Police and one is manned by the third battalion. Most of the gates have door-frame metal detectors for checking. Meanwhile, in the wake of a heightened alert at Tihar, gangster Lawrence Bishnoi was shifted to Ajmer jail, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/jails-are-on-high-alert-dg-lists-outmeasures-vigil-on-gang-members/articleshow/86516838.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Thiruvananthapuram: A Goddess for each letter, carved in stone||KOLLAM: For the first time in the country, a temple in Thiruvananthapuram will have idols of Goddesses named after the 51 Malayalam letters in the alphabet. The idols sculpted at Myladi, the second largest sculptors’ village after Thanjavoor in Tamil Nadu, will be taken to the Pournamikavu temple, Chavadinada, near Vizhinjam, 17 kilometres from the city, and will be consecrated on Mahanavami day. The Devi temple here opens only on Pournami (full Moon day) of every month. The ambitious project to make an idol for each letter was taken up after decades long research and discussions with the chief tantris of major temples, including Pushpanjali Swamiyar of Sri Padmanabha Swamy temple, Mitran Namboodirippadu and Malliyoor Sankaran Namboodiri. Well-known lyricist Kaithapram Damodaran Namboodri was also consulted as part of the project, temple trustee M S Bhuvanachandran said. “The deities of each Malayalam letter were found based on writings of Rig Veda, Siva Samhita, Devi Bhagavatam, Harinamakeerthanam, and on the references in the kritis of Adi Shankara. Before fixing the final form of the deities, decades long research and discussions were held. In the ancient times, sages had realised the powers of letters and had recorded it for the benefits of the posterity,” Bhuvanachandran said.  The first challenge was codifying all this knowledge and arriving at the final details of the idols. The sculptors and researchers also have gone through the research studies and compared it with what is stated about it in Vedas. They realised that all the deities behind the letters were goddesses in the Devi cult. They identified 51 deities and brought them to life in the stone figures chiselled out by master sculptors of Myladi. They have sculpted each letter at the bottom of each idol. According to Pushpanjali Swamiyar, reference to these deities can be found in Harinamakeerthanam (sloka -14 to 16). Though Goddess Saraswati is considered to be the goddess of knowledge, she is the deity of Malayalam letter ‘tha’. It may be noted that in the Vedas and Puranas there are references to Goddess Kali wearing a garland of 51 skulls representing the letters. Each of the idols here has distinct attire, jewellery, weapons and vahana (rides). “Before deciding over the three dimensional pictures of the deities, elaborate efforts were made to prepare the sculpture with all minute details based on scriptures in Vedas and epics,” chief sculpture Madankumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/a-goddess-for-each-letter-carved-in-stone/articleshow/86516864.cms||---

On September 23, a C-130 military transport aircraft successfully landed at the NDA airfield. An academy official said with the successful landing and take-off of the aircraft, the classification of the airfield as a facility hosting operations by frontline IAF transport aircraft has been ratified. “This milestone will go a long way in the use of the NDA airfield for training and operational military aviation,” the official said. Trials for a fixed-wing landing of a Dornier aircraft and a successful landing were done in 2019. “Subsequently, a detailed study of the runway and the terrain was carried out, and the first-ever trial landing by a C-130 aircraft was achieved on September 23,” said the official. NDA has a full-fledged airfield where the sixth-term air force cadets undergo training in sorties in the Super Dimona aircraft. “The runway is also used for routine training and operational missions by the Mi 17 1V medium-lift helicopters, Chetaks, and army advanced light helicopters,” said the official. The runway is around 1.5km long and 30m wide. “With its 5,000-foot runway and functional air traffic control, the airfield can host military air operations by helicopter and most fixed-wing transport aircraft,” said the academy official. Group Captain (retd) Johnson Chacko, a fighter pilot and former senior instructor of air force training at NDA, said the academy’s runway can now be used for an emergency landing. “Light aircraft used by businessmen can make an emergency landing. In the event of an adverse security scenario at the Pune airport, the NDA runway can be used for operational purposes,” said Chacko.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/c-130-aircraft-lands-at-nda-airfield-ready-for-operational-military-aviation-officials/articleshow/86516847.cms||Sandip Dighe

One of the accused is the owner of coaching institute, who had to appear as a dummy candidate. Police have also recovered cash, cheques and forged documents from these persons. DCP (East) Bhuvan Bhushan Yadav said police were on high alert in view of unfair practices during REET and had been keeping an eye on miscreants. “We had a coaching institute in Paota of Jodhpur by the name of Meera Gurukul on our radar based on some intelligence inputs”, said Yadav. Police special teams began with gathering inputs about the activities of the operators of this institute and scanned their mobile data. The outcome was enough for to swing into action. “Information gathered by us revealed that the operator of the institute, Bhanwar Lal Bishnoi, had struck a deal with a candidate to appear in the examination on his behalf. For this, the candidate had agreed to pay him Rs 9 lakh,” said Yadav. Of the full amount, Rs 4.5 lakh was to be received by Bhanwar Lal on Saturday as advance. But timely action of police foiled their attempt to execute the plan. Besides this, Bishnoi had also prepared to leak the paper and resort to some other unfair practices for which he had called some candidates to his home. “On this intelligence, we raided Bishnois’ house on Saturday afternoon and arrested him along with 3 others, which include Ramesh Bishnoi, Rawtaram Jat and Mohanlal Bishnoi. All the 3 are the REET candidates”, Yadav said. Police also recovered some fabricated documents from these candidates which included Adhaar cards and admit card of Ramesh with photo of Bhanwar lal and Rs 4.5 lakh paid in advance to Bhanwarlal by Ramesh. Besides this, police also recovered two cheques of Rs 5 lakh each from Rawtaram, which he had to hand over to Bhanwarlal for arranging a dummy candidate in place of him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/jodhpur-cops-bust-gang-of-dummy-candidates-4-held/articleshow/86518878.cms||---
---||Chennai||Co-living it up||CHENNAI: When Mumbaikar Mamta Solanki moved to Bengaluru for work in 2019, she shared a flat with other women. But when the pandemic broke out, her flatmates moved out. That’s when she decided to give co-living a try. Today, the tech consultant is glad she did, as her expenses have halved, while she gets to enjoy the same, if not better, standard of living. "Earlier, I had to pay `15,000 for just rent and maintenance. Now I pay half the amount for a twin sharing room in a furnished 2BHK, which covers electricity, water, a fully stocked kitchen and access to a vibrant community of young professionals," she says. In India, the concept of co-living facilities began catching on a few years ago. Designed to cater to students and young professionals, they offer monthly rents ranging from Rs10,000 to Rs20,000 including water, electricity, Wi-Fi, housekeeping and use of common areas and amenities. They do not have the restrictions of a PG or the hassles of maintaining an apartment. And while the sector did take a hit during the pandemic, co-living facilities are back in demand as people return to offices. Rahul Baliga, co-founder of Bengaluru-based FF21 which began operations in 2017, says, "People want to move away from the traditional PG accommodation as they find it restrictive and not up to their standards of hygiene. Also, they offer no spaces to socialise." Today, FF21 operates eight buildings with 1,100 beds. "Each building has tastefully done common areas — lounge, dining rooms, home theatre, game room, terrace as well as little nooks to chill," he says, adding that the demand is picking up. "We are seeing 10%-15% growth every month since May." Priya Atri, co-founder of Convivo, a marketplace for co-living where companies can list their properties, says, "Our clients are mainly students and single working professionals. People are looking for flexibility in their living arrangements; many want to take it up for just a month or two," she says. Facilities ensure their staff are vaccinated and ask occupants to produce vaccination certificates. Abhishek Tripathi, co-founder of Settl that launched in August 2020 and has 13 properties in Bengaluru and Hyderabad, says the aim is to make city living effortless. "People move to cities for work and renting an apartment means paying security deposits. Also they don’t want the hassle of doing household chores," he says. There are facilities to meet every budget. Casa Grande, which launched Staylogy this January, has 11 fully furnished 5BHK villas in Chennai’s Perungudi area. "Since it is a gated community, residents have access to the gym and swimming pool," says K Dharaneshwaran, assistant sales manager, Staylogy. With people still sticking to safety protocols, the demand for private rooms and studios has risen. According to a recent survey by Colive covering 20,000 respondents, around 91% of the occupiers prefer to live alone as compared to shared living — 82% prefer a one bedroom or studio apartment, 61% prefer private rooms. However, 39%still prefer shared rooms, as it helps them forge new bonds. The rent depends on how many people share a room. "The monthly rent is `10,500 for four-sharing and includes electricity charges, Wi-Fi, and housekeeping. For single sharing, it is `20,500," says Dharaneshwaran. "They have to pay a month’s deposit and give a month’s notice." A bed in a studio apartment in Settl is `11,000 per month. With many women opting for such facilities — FF21 has 56% men and 44% women occupants while Settl has 60% men and 40% women residents — properties offer separate floors for men and women with access-controlled doors and CCTV cameras. They are also concentrating on fostering a sense of community. "After experiencing lockdown and loneliness, people feel the need for it," says Tripathi. "We have set up co-working spaces where people can network." Settl also has initiatives to bring residents together — jamming sessions, barbecue nights and bootcamps for professionals, such as a recent one on personal wealth management, and fitness activities such as Zumba and cycling events. Hitesh Hingorani, who recently moved from Jaipur to Bengaluru for work, says he enjoys the facilities that come with such spaces. "It has a workstation, game room with TT and pool tables, so it’s a big draw for young people," says the 24-year-old software developer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/co-living-it-up/articleshow/86516819.cms||Priya Menon
---||Bhopal||With Cong, and will remain so: Ajay Singh||BHOPAL: Putting an end to all speculations about his joining ruling BJP, Congress leader Ajay Singh on Saturday said the assumptions of his leaving the Congress party are baseless. “From my father, the late Arjun Singh, I have inherited the quality of taking everyone along. He always identified himself as a soldier of the Congress party. I do not want to go against my father’s ideologies and become subject to criticism,” the former LoP said. Singh has been in the limelight after he visited home minister Narottam Mishra earlier this week. Three days later, Mishra and BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya visited him on his birthday. “I carry my father’s tradition. I am a Congressman from my soul, am with the Congress party and will remain with it. Those who think I might switch over to BJP, my humble appeal is they should let go of this imaginary theory. My commitment is with Congress,” the five- time MLA said. Recalling Arjun Singh’s political career, he said that his father always respected the Opposition. “He always patiently heard suggestions that came from Opposition members and was never disturbed by their criticism. He followed healthy democratic traditions. Though the Opposition came with different ideologie, he did not let that come in the way of development,” Singh said. Singh argued that even with a BJP government in the state, Arjun Singh’s contributions towards MP will always be remembered. He said that when he was minister, BBJP MLAs would often come to him regarding work in their constituencies. “I used to resolve their problems. Many of them are now ministers in the state government. Similarly, I also go and meet them regarding problems in my area and public works. Often, we give each other courtesy calls. The Opposition is not the enemy and there is no place for betrayal in a democracy. These meetings should not be deduced as my quitting the party,” Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/with-cong-and-will-remain-so-ajay-singh/articleshow/86516845.cms||Suchandana Gupta

The duo had reached the Rohini court dressed up as lawyers to kill Jitender Maan alias Gogi. Fafunda and Jagga, who were shot dead by the police in retaliation fire at the Rohini Court room number-207, hailed from Meerut and Sonipat, respectively. Jagga was in awe of gang leader Tillu. An investigator stated that Jagga even had a tattoo of Tillu on his forearm. “His father, his brother and a relative had reached the capital. As per his father, he left the house around a month back without saying anything but did maintain contact with his family. His family members stated that he switched off his phone a week back and since then was not reachable,” the investigating officer said. On the other hand, Fafunda also goes by the name Nitin and KK. He is a wanted criminal and carried a reward of Rs 50,000 after he managed to escape after commiitng a murder in Outer Delhi’s Begumpur area last year. He is involved in seven cases, including cases registered under gangster act in UP, arms act and murder cases in Ghaziabad. “The two are also wanted in a murder case in UP. We are fetching details of the case,” the officer added. Fafunda’s family members said he had not gone home for the last one year and barely maintained contact with them. A medical board has been formed for their postmortem scheduled to be conducted on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/one-of-the-shooters-had-tattoo-of-tillu/articleshow/86516859.cms||---

---||Kolhapur||We will welcome Somaiya: Mushrif||Kolhapur: Rural development minister Hasan Mushrif on Saturday appealed to the NCP supporters to not oppose BJP leader Kirit Somaiya, who is likely to visit Kolhapur on Tuesday. Somaiya had leveled serious allegations of corruption against Mushrif. Earlier this week, Somaiya tried to go to Kolhapur, however, the police had stopped him at Karad. Now he is trying to visit Kolhapur again, but after taking permission from district collector Rahul Rekhawar. Somaiya is likely to register a criminal complaint against Mushrif and his family members over the alleged corruption in sugar factory deals. “The party workers should not oppose Somaiya. We will welcome him. But we request him to not make any derogatory remark that may anger the party workers. I request all the supporters to remain calm and request the administration to ensure Somaiya’s safety and well-being,” said Mushrif. The district police administration has issued notices to over 80 workers of NCP and BJP, asking them not to create any ruckus, otherwise, be prepared to face legal action. Since the corruption allegations have been made, the workers of both parties have been engaged in a war of words, and once even got into a scuffle. The town council of Murgud has reversed the decision to ban Somaiya in the town. Instead, the Mushrif supporters will hold black flags along the way during Somaiya’s visit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/we-will-welcome-somaiya-mushrif/articleshow/86513255.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Lawyers abstain from work in district courts for better security||NEW DELHI: A day after the shootout at Rohini District Courts Complex, questions are being raised and meetings are being held regarding security lapses in all the other six district courts in Delhi. Lawyers also abstained from work in all the district courts on Saturday to push for revision of security arrangements. Advocate Rakesh Sherawat, chairman of Bar Council of Delhi, said that a meeting was held with Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana, wherein the bar members pointed out the security lapses. “We have pointed out the lapses regarding CCTV cameras not in working condition, metal detectors not properly working and the police personnel not diligently doing their duties. We want to fix accountability of these officers,” Sherawat told TOI. “The police commissioner was equally concerned and he acknowledged that there was some fault. He promised us that he will rectify those and come back with a complete foolproof security plan for all district courts,” he said. Rakesh Wadhwa, president of New Delhi Bar Association, said there were lapses in security in all the district courts. “At the Patiala House court, we have as many as 12-13 gates. It’s very difficult to have a thorough security arrangement,” he said. Wadhwa further said, in a meeting held with the district judge, it was proposed to have only three gates for entry and exit of litigants and lawyers. “We are appealing to the lawyers also that they should not hesitate in getting themselves frisked and if somebody wants to check them, they should volunteer for their thorough checking. We are looking for arrangements for restricted entry here.” YP Singh, the president of the Dwarka Bar Association, said lawyers fully cooperated in their security checks and claimed it was a lapse on the part of the Delhi Police. “There is no problem regarding frisking of lawyers. The personnel deputed here are those who do not do their duty properly. If a lawyer refuses, it would have been reported to the Bar Association. We have got no such complaints ever,” Singh claimed. He further said that the intelligence unit of the police failed and they should have taken all precautions while producing such a notorious gangster before the court. “Every court room’s entry has a metal detector for checking bags. It’s simply a case where the blame has been put on the lawyers. The Delhi high court’s security model should be followed at the district courts too,” he told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/lawyers-abstain-from-work-in-dist-courts-for-better-security/articleshow/86516869.cms||Usha Das
---||Kochi||Fishermen entitled to compensation: Kerala govt to SC||KOCHI: The Kerala government has informed the Supreme Court that the fishermen, including a minor, who were in the fishing boat shot at by Italian marines on board MV Enrica Lexie have been left out in the order for finalizing compensation that was issued by the court. In a statement filed through the government’s counsel G Prakash, the state government said the fishermen, including the minor, are entitled to compensation for moral harm as per the award passed by International Tribunal on Law of the Sea (ITLOS) on May 21, 2020. “It is submitted that no amount has been ordered to be paid to the other crew members of St Antony (including the applicants) though the award specifically states that the compensation to be paid to India is also towards the moral harm suffered by the fishermen,” the statement said. The Supreme Court had, on June 15, ordered to transfer Rs 10 crore deposited by Italian government to the Kerala high court, which would oversee distribution of compensation. Of this, Rs 4 crore each was to be paid to dependents of the two fishermen who had died and Rs 2 crore was ordered to be paid to the boat owner, as per the apex court’s order. Kerala government’s statement said it received a claim for compensation by dependents of a 14-year-old name Prijin A, who was allegedly onboard the fishing boat at the time of shooting. Prijin had committed suicide in 2019 after allegedly battling with depression since the 2012 shooting. Similarly, Kanyakumari district collector received a claim for compensation for the eight other fishermen who were on the boat. Prijin’s mother had recently filed a petition before the Kerala high court seeking compensation and had produced an affidavit signed by the other fishermen attesting that Prijin was with them at the time of shooting. The family had earlier alleged that the boat owner did not divulge Prijin’s presence for fear of legal action for employing a juvenile. The state government statement in the SC said, “Pertinently, as per the Arbitral Award, all crew members onboard are entitled for compensation. Hence, the Government found it just to divide the amount proposed to the boat owner among all fishermen. In virtue of the Arbitral Award, the Government of Kerala decided that an amount of Rs 2 crore, which was initially proposed to be given to the boat owner (in the absence of other claim) be apportioned among all the 10 fishermen.” A letter from the state additional chief secretary (home) to the Union foreign secretary on June 8 this year, which was produced before the court, also mentioned about the compensation for the minor. The letter said, “The names of the nine crew members including boat captain are seen mentioned in the Arbitral Award. But name of the minor does not mention there. Pertinently, as per the Arbitral Award, all crew members onboard are entitled for compensation no matter whether they were minor or major at the time of incident.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/fishermen-entitled-to-compensation-govt-to-sc/articleshow/86516880.cms||---

Taking to Twitter, Nath said, “In Harda, the constituency of state agriculture minister Kamal Patel, accounts of farmers have been frozen for non-payment of power bills.” प्रदेश के कृषि मंत्री के क्षेत्र हरदा में किसानों से बिजली बिल वसूली के लिए किसानों के खाते सीज कर दिए, इतना ही न… https://t.co/LWJeRy0O51— Kamal Nath (@OfficeOfKNath) 1632551591000The former chief minister also alleged that the Chouhan government has not paid farmers compensation and insurance claims for previous year’s crop damage. In another tweet, Nath recalled that chief minister Chouhan while in Opposition during the 15-month Congress government had asked farmers not to pay inflated electricity bills. “This is the same party in power that once used to say to farmers not to pay inflated electricity bills. And Chouhan used to say that if someone snaps the power connection then he will come to connect the same. Today, his government is suppressing farmers like criminals,” Nath alleged. The veteran Congress leader demanded immediate roll-back of the government order to freeze accounts of farmers.  “I demand from the state government to immediately withdraw this absurd and dictatorial decision. Farmers should first be paid their last year’s dues and insurance claims. Their accounts should be regularised at the earliest or else the Congress party will not sit silently, but will agitate on the roads,” Nath said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/state-govt-dictatorial-anti-kisan-alleges-nath/articleshow/86516870.cms||---
---||India||CJI calls for people-friendly judiciary to help the vulnerable||CUTTACK: Chief Justice of India N V Ramana on Saturday said unless the legal framework is drastically altered to make the justice delivery mechanism more people-friendly, it won’t be possible to ensure that the most vulnerable sections get to exercise their rights. Even after 74 years of Independence, the CJI said, traditional and agrarian societies feel hesitant to approach the courts. “The practices, procedures, language and everything of the courts feel alien to them. Between the complex language of the acts and process of justice delivery, the common man seems to lose control over the fate of his grievance. Often in his trajectory, the justice seeker feels like an outsider to the system,” CJI Ramana said. He said the judicial system faces twin challenges — the need to Indianise the judiciary system, and enabling people to decode the justice delivery system by raising awareness.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cji-calls-for-people-friendly-judiciary-to-help-the-vulnerable/articleshow/86521271.cms||lalmohan.patnaik
---||Chennai||Fifty shades of graze||CHENNAI: With all the fuss these days about fuss-free dining, grazing boards seem to have taken centre stage. The ‘just thrown together’ platter (in reality artfully curated) bursting with the four Cs — crudites, crackers, cheese and charcuterie — is increasingly becoming the theme of dinner table conversations at home gatherings across the city. "House parties have become popular as people are wary of going out during the pandemic. And every host wants something unique, so at the moment it’s the grazing board or grazing table that’s helping to take their dinner party up a notch," says Divya Pesala of Italiano With a Twist, a restaurant that also specialises in curating grazing boards. As for graze anatomy, every board contains a range of finger foods: artisan cheese, cured meats, fruits, vegetables, olives, fresh bread, gourmet crackers, nuts, dried fruit, dips, chips, chocolates, and more, arranged on a large board or table that guests can pick and choose from. A dollop of honey on a salted cracker perhaps or peach jam on Melba toast, topped with a slice of ham — the combinations are at your fingertips. "Grazing boards can be customised — a dessert board with different types of chocolates coupled with a spread of nuts and raisins, tarts and bread or an Indian, or Mediterranean themed one," says city-based architect Naashitha Nasser, who started Instagram-based business Platter Mi Amor in February, when she realised her made-at-home boards were a hit among friends. These boards have an exotic feel about them. They are great conversation starters, with people moving around the board, reaching out for something they like," says Naashitha, who makes flavoured cheese for her boards as well as outsources them from cheesemakers across India. Minal Kripalani, for instance, creates custom-made flavoured cream cheese ricotta balls that can be ordered. "These boards are popular at house parties as they free up the host who otherwise has to keep worrying about the flow of food, from starter to dessert. Here, the board is set up and people just pick bites when they want," says Minal, who has several orders for her Italian, pepper, and cranberry flavoured cheese balls. While some say the grazing board has its origins as a food trend in Australia, others give it a British origin, and Gunit Singla of the catering service Uncle Sam’s Kitchen believes it is an offshoot of the Scandinavian smorgasbord. "We have now tweaked the grazing board in keeping with Covid protocol," says Gunit. "We don’t recommend different hands touching the same food, so what we have done is arrange mini platters of the items on the table," she says. "Our grazing boards would have a little dish with just nachos, with cheese and pear slices, some mini bowls with cheese and nuts, or nuts and fruit, cocktail glasses of vegetables, and so on. You still make your own pairings." Grazing boards can be small, medium or large with prices starting from Rs2,000 a box to upward of Rs6,000. More, if you’d like the buffet consultants to do up a table at home, complete with lights flowers and props.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/fifty-shades-of-graze/articleshow/86516891.cms||Kamini Mathai
---||Delhi||Visited AIIMS without notice too: Minister||New Delhi: Union health minister Mansukh Madaviya, who was reportedly hit by a guard when he went to Safdarjung hospital posing as a patient, on Saturday said he had made several visits to AIIMS as well. “Sometimes I visit without any notice,” the health minister said while speaking at an event organised by the institute to mark the 66th foundation day of the institute. “When I go to a hospital, I feel sad to see bouncers because people come to hospitals to get treatment and not to fight. Then, why do they fight? Possibly because they get angry. Some shortcoming from us may have caused it,” he added. Mandaviya said if doctors see patients as gods, then there won’t be any long queues. “We tell patients to come tomorrow or the day after, but we should try to treat them on the same day,” he said. The health minister also referred to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s words that everyone has to act together to get something done. “The government and the public alone cannot get things done,” he said while asking the various departments of AIIMS to adopt a similar approach. Congratulating the institute, the minister said, AIIMS, New Delhi is a “lighthouse” to all the 22 other AIIMS hospitals across India. He said students and teachers of the branch in the capital could help other institutes through their rich experience. Mandaviya said the country’s healthcare system has grown due to the relentless efforts of the Modi government. “The budget outlay for health has increased 137% since last year to 2.4 lakh crore. Ayushman Bharat has transformed healthcare in the country as poor patients can access non-government treatment facilities earlier reserved for only those who could afford it,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/visited-aiims-without-notice-too-minister/articleshow/86518911.cms||---

The fate of 24 candidates who are in fray for seven seats at GSHSEB are now sealed till the day of the counting on Tuesday when the results will be declared, said sources in GSHSEB. A total of 76,175 voters were registered and the elections were conducted in 108 polling stations across the state. A total of 50,148 voters have cast their votes. The elections are held on the lines of a new set of rules introduced by the state government in the form of The Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (Amendment) Act, in September 2020. The new rules have reduced the number of elected members to the board from 26 to nine. The elections for these members are held every three years. With two candidates being elected unopposed, the elections were held for seven members. The elections were earlier scheduled to be held in April but were postponed due to the rise in number of Covid-19 cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/66-voting-for-gshseb-polls/articleshow/86516886.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: REET to be a litmus test for police today||JAIPUR: Rajasthan police’s claims of elaborate security arrangements will be put to a litmus test on Sunday when over 16 lakh students will appear for REET (Rajasthan Eligibility Examination for Teachers) across the state. In the run up to the mammoth exercise, the state government held a series of video conferences with the district collectors and the superintendents of police to amplify that they will be held accountable if there was any untoward situation. Accordingly, police officials across the state on Saturday briefed their additional SPs and SHOs about maintaining law and order on streets, control crowds outside examination halls and communicating seamlessly all through the day. All roadside activities were kept under strict monitoring. Restaurants, tea shops, food joints and kiosks selling cigarettes were directed to close down by 11pm. Similarly, patrolling vehicles of all police stations fanned out, doing rounds at bus stands, examination centres and railway stations. Police parties held spot drills and set up traffic assistance booths. According to a senior official, commando crews will guard strong rooms where answer sheets will be kept. In the wake of a major accident in which six REET students were killed in Chaksu, monitoring of highways and arterial roads became a major cause of concern. In some districts, highway patrol units were told to cover additional routes to keep a check on reckless drivers. At other places, stretches of highways were earmarked for patrolling by police bikes. Police officials said that each student will be thoroughly frisked before they could enter the examination hall. Two constables, two home guards and at least two woman constables will be deployed for frisk and search so that no cheating device could slip in. Police said that additional personnel were drawn from home guards, border home guards, along with 50 companies of RAC (Rajasthan Armed Constabulary) to support local police. Additional companies have also been posted to GRP (Government Railway Police) to control the rush of students at railway stations. “Our chief responsibility is to prevent cheating, control movement of students and ensure the safety of common people on Sunday,” the official said. However, with the swelling number of students who are pouring into cities for REET, police units are stretched out too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/reet-to-be-a-litmus-test-for-police-today/articleshow/86518909.cms||---
---||Pune||Saturday morning bedlam at Pune airport due to runway maintenance work||PUNE: Chaos prevailed at the airport on Saturday with many flyers on the verge of missing their flights due to crowded check-in and security check counters, while arriving passengers were forced to wait up to half-an-hour for RT-PCR verification. According to airport officials, runway closure from 11am-3pm for maintenance and bunching of arriving flights led to crowding and delays. On Saturday, 78 flights operated at the Pune airport as against 116 on Friday. Uploading a video on social media of a long queue at the arrival bay, a passenger wrote that it was people waiting to show RT-PCR reports. “The waiting time was 20-30 minutes with just two staffers checking certificates. There was also little regard for social distancing,” he said. “I got off the aircraft around 10.30am but exited the airport only past 11.15am,” said another flyer. The official handle of the Pune airport on Twitter, responding to the passenger who uploaded the video, said bunching of arrival flights led to rush during exit RT-PCR checks. “Our teams are available to clear the queues as quickly as possible. We are also reviewing the process for further improvement. On Saturdays, there is a runway closure from 11am to 3pm which resulted in the bunching of arriving flights before 11am,” said the airport Twitter handle. Another flyer, Keshav Lagwal, said despite coming to the airport two hours in advance, people were on the verge of missing their flights. “I almost missed my flight and had to request other passengers to jump the queue. There was no one to help,” said Lagwal. Earlier, Pune airport director Santosh Dhoke had said that space was the biggest challenge for the airport. On Friday, Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari said the Centre’s infrastructure committee would soon approve the transfer of 13 acres of land in lieu of land in Chandigarh for the airport’s expansion plans. Another flyer, however, sought to know about the status of the proposed airport at Purandar. “Why has the state government forgotten about the new airport project in Purandar and why is it pushing for the expansion of this facility?” said the flyer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/saturday-morning-bedlam-at-airport-due-to-runway-maintenance-work/articleshow/86516884.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Second phase likely to be operational by 2026||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The second phase expansion of Idukki hydro power project by Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) may become operational by 2026 if everything goes as per board’s plans for the mammoth project estimated at an investment of Rs 4,000 crore. According to a concept note prepared by the board’s top management, at least three of the total six new generating stations, each with 130MW capacity, would be ready for commissioning in 2026 if the work starts in 2022 as planned. The Idukki project will be completing its 50th anniversary in 2026. After the feasibility study, the board will soon float a global tender for the new 780MW power house, using the same reservoir of the Idukki project that currently generates around 15% of power consumed in the state. Besides Idukki, KSEB owns several other reservoirs such as Kundala, Mattupetti, Anayirankal, Ponmudi, Sengulam, Kallarkutty, lower Periyar, Kallar and Irattayar in Idukki district. “KSEB can start work of the second power house of Idukki in 2022 after obtaining necessary permissions. The initial estimate for the project is assessed at Rs 4,000 crore,” said the concept note prepared by the board. It also proposed an idea of setting up tourism-adventure townships by sensibly utilising the land under KSEB’s custody and similar agencies in Idukki district. The note also proposed to establish a ‘dam tourism circuit’ by introducing seaplane service connecting dams owned by KSEB. The project could be rolled out in association with the state tourism department, without touching the forest areas. “For example, seaplane service can be introduced connecting Thiruvananthapuram airport-Idukki dam and Banasurasagar dam (in Wayanad). The Kerala Hydel Tourism Centre under KSEB has prepared a preliminary DPR for the project,” the note added. The board had in June submitted a proposal to Union tourism ministry seeking assistance of Rs 180 crore for setting up a skywalk at Idukki Nadukanipuram, laser show at Idukki dam and an underground aquarium. The board is awaiting clearance from the ministry for the project under Swadesi Darsan programme. Meanwhile, the board has also mooted the idea of setting up the project in BOOT model.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/second-phase-likely-to-be-operational-by-2026/articleshow/86517001.cms||B S Anilkumar

NCB recovered hashish, LSD blots and MDMA/Ecstasy pills from the four, all arrested in Goa. Agisilaos, a South African, was arrested by NCB for the third time in a year. NCB had last year questioned Rampal while it was probing a drug case. The agency had questioned Rampal’s partner Gabriella Demetriades too. NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede said, “Agisilaos was earlier arrested twice. We seized a small quantity of hashish/charas from his house in North Goa. He was produced in court, which remanded him to judicial custody till Monday.” Agisilaos was first arrested last year while NCB was probing a drug case after the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput. “He was arrested when we were investigating a cocaine peddling case,” said Wankhede. Rampal said, “It’s unfortunate that my name is being unnecessarily dragged in every publication though I have no association whatsoever. As far as my family and I are concerned, my direct family and I are law-abiding citizens. And while the incident involves a person who is a relative of my partner, I have no other connection or relationship other than that with this person”. The others arrested in Goa were Noumaan Savery (22), Siddique Ahmed (25) and Mayur Mohnani alias Amit(22).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-arjun-rampal-partners-bro-among-4-held-by-ncb-in-goa/articleshow/86518932.cms||---

The police also said that the gang was busted with the help of members of district anti-narcotic special action force (DANSAF) under the rural district police. All members of the gang were habitual offenders who were involved in various crimes in the past, the police said. Hence, DANSAF was monitoring their activities for the past six months. Based on the intelligence collected by the DANSAF officials, the arrest was done. The gang had procured the contraband from Bangalore. Their friends who were working in Bangalore helped them procure the substance. They smuggled it across the state border in a car which they rented for this purpose. The gang members admitted that they had smuggled ganja and drugs into the state several times in the past too using the same modus. They would sell the contraband among small scale peddlers after smuggling it into the state, the police said.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Law on MTP is not in sync with many others, says lawyer||MUMBAI: Dr Nikhil Datar, the city-based gynecologist who began the movement for changing the time limit of medical termination of pregnancy in 2008, said, “I am not planning to withdraw the case from the Supreme Court as there is still some work left to be done.” Lawyer Anubha Rastogi said, “We were hoping the amendment would be in the form of an acknowledgement of women’s rights, but it has not happened so far.’’ The amended law also is not yet in sync with many other legislations covering the rights of the disabled, mentally ill and transgenders, among others, she said. She further pointed out, “The rules stating whom the new time limit applies to need to be properly defined. Earlier, doctors would use their medicinal background to assess if continuing a pregnancy would adversely affect a woman’s health, but there are no guidelines yet.’’ In the last five years, over 300 cases have been filed by women seeking medical termination beyond the thenpermissible limit of 20 weeks. “A system was created by courts to direct such pleas to a medical board. With the new amendment coming into force, we need to set up such linkages again. A guidance note or a framework has to be there,” said Dr Datar. In 2008, Dr Datar first moved Bombay high court and then the SC when his patient, Nikita Mehta, wanted to terminate her 24-week pregnancy after a scan showed cardiac anomalies in the foetus. While Mehta did not get permission to terminate the pregnancy and subsequently lost her baby, Dr Datar continued with his plea to extend the 20-week time limit. His reasoning was simple: Some brain and heart anomalies do not show up in scans until after the 20th week. “We fought the battle and, brick by brick, have managed to get so far, but certain rules need to be laid down with a lot of thought,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-law-on-mtp-is-not-in-sync-with-many-others-lawyer/articleshow/86518984.cms||---

If the proposal sees the light of the day, it will be first underpass having such a facility. A JDA official said, “An idea has been mooted to keep the provision of an elevator in the underpass. This would be beneficial for the disabled. Moreover, the width of the ramps will also be designed for commuters using wheelchairs.” The civic body is likely to finalise the design of the underpass this week. Following this, tenders will be invited. “Recently, financial and administrative approval for traffic improvement and beautification at Laxmi Mandir Junction on Tonk Road was given in the project works committee (PWC) meeting. The project will be undertaken at a cost of Rs 81.25 crore,” said an official. Under the project, the JDA will construct two-lane 400-metre-long underpass between Sabzi Mandi and Tond Road to provide swift vehicular movement in West-South direction. Along with this, a dedicated subway will be constructed to provide safe access to pedestrians. The civic body has also proposed a facade development in the area along with sculptures of freedom fighters. An official said the project was the need of the hour as Laxmi Mandir is a three-legged intersection and acts as one of the major exchange points for many public transport users. Due to increase in traffic from Bais Godam, Gandhi Nagar and Gopalpura, long queues are observed during the signal timings towards all these three approaches. The state government had earlier announced to construct seven junction traffic free in the state capital. In phase-1, the facelift of Laxmi Madir will be done by the agency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jda-plans-to-make-laxmi-mandir-underpass-disabled-friendly/articleshow/86518968.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

DCP (Jaipur South) Harendra Kumar told TOI that he had spoken to all SHOs to ensure that drivers travelling long distances get refreshment at regular intervals. “A meeting was held with all officials concerned. They are making arrangements for the same with the help of eateries, hotels and dhabas located along the highways,” he said. Police said that local police stations are making sure that drivers get enough rest on the way. Besides arrangements for hot cups of tea and coffee, police intensified vigilance over highway traffic routes. “Highway patrol units are already present at the moment, we have also deputed two bikes-borne cops at every 10km for better monitoring,” Kumar added. Cops suspect that drowsiness led to the mishap in Chaksu leading to the death of six persons. An official said that many REET students are still pouring into the city from different directions in jam-packed vehicles. “All highway patrol units have been strictly told to ensure that REET vehicles don’t speed on the highways as it poses a risk for students,” an official said, adding that bus drivers have also been told to drive safely on highways because of the increasing amount of vehicular traffic. Maximum number of REET students are travelling from Sikar Road, followed by Agra and Tonk Road. Highways that cut through those roads are placed under strict surveillance after the accident. Nearly 1.37 lakh students have their REET centres in Jaipur, while 83,000 will travel from the city to other districts like Alwar, Sikar and Bharatpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/drivers-ferrying-students-to-get-free-beverages/articleshow/86518929.cms||---

''A few days ago, I took her out of the house. On the road we came across two KSEB staff who were wearing khaki uniforms. She suddenly panicked and clenched my hand,'' said her father Jayachandran. He said that ironically, this happened when he had taken her for a small outing as advised by the doctor during counselling to help her forget the harrowing experience. Jayachandran and wife Rekha staged a hunger strike in front of the secretariat here on Saturday to register their protest against the police apathy towards them. They alleged that though the Inspector General (south zone) was directed by the state police chief to register a case and launch a probe on August 31, the IG is yet to record the family's statement. ''Till now, no one from the police department has contacted us in connection with the case. No statements recorded means they have not even started the probe,'' Jayachandran said. They were publicly harassed by pink police officer Rejitha at Attingal on August 27. The officer accused the father and daughter of stealing her mobile phone from the pink police patrol squad. She went on to say that she was sure from their appearance that they were thieves. She even tried to take them to the police station for frisking. Later, the phone was found from her bag kept inside the car. The family said if the police continued with their apathy, they would approach the court .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/family-stages-a-hunger-strike/articleshow/86516985.cms||---

The hospital was sanctioned in 2016, and was completed at an estimated cost of Rs 9 crore in 2020, but due to the Covid-19 pandemic, its launch was delayed. The hospital will have an Ayush OPD, and in future there will be advanced special treatment facilities. The treatment modalities in ayurveda panchakarma, jalouka (leech therapy), Kshara sutra and Abhyanga therapy are available at the centre. In naturopathy, hydrotherapy, acupuncture, acupressure, colour therapy, magnetic therapy and physiotherapy will be available. In unani, the centre will offer dhalak, hijama and so on, said Mangaluru City South MLA D Vedavyas Kamath in his presidential address. He added that more facilities will be provided at the centre in future. In Udupi Earlier, during the day, the minister said that of late ayurveda and other traditional medicine systems are widely recognised. “The acceptability of ayurveda can be improved further, through more research, scientific validation and findings,” he said, after inaugurating the new Rathnashree Arogyadhama hospital in Kuthpady. He added that the ayurveda field needs more research activities, as there is growing demand. Increase in the number of foreign students who are opting for ayurveda is a testimony to the fact that the Indian system of medicine has been receiving more acceptability. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi set up the separate Ayush ministry in 2014, and accorded it cabinet status predominantly to do research,” he said. “There are a lot of herbal plants with medicinal value in India, and scientific research in the area is the need of the hour. It is because of sincere efforts by our ancestors, that ayurveda has been accepted globally,” he added Shobha Karandlaje, Union minister of state for agriculture and farmers’ welfare, said the significance of organic food and ayurveda has gained prominence across the world.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/sonowal-inaugurates-ayush-multispeciality-hospital/articleshow/86515120.cms||---
---||Delhi||Important to sensitise students, build a diverse and inclusive society: JNU VC||New Delhi: At a webinar organised by Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) on India’s partition, vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar said that partition horrors had a “trans-generational impact” and that the “collective memory of suffering” could not be forgotten. The webinar on “India, partition and its aftermath – Remembering the horrors of history” was held on Saturday and saw several speakers reiterate the need for the “Partition Horrors Remembrance Day.” Stating that it was important to sensitise students and build a diverse and inclusive society, Kumar said, “Millions of people were killed, women were abducted and raped, there was widespread arson and villages were burnt down. The collective memory of suffering cannot be forgotten and it should be revisited so that the horrific history is not repeated. There was a clear indication of strategic interest that the British had in dividing India. We need to sensitise our students on the importance of building a diverse and inclusive country.” At the event, RSS leader Ram Madhav said that India’s partition was not just about redrawing boundaries but also a “partition of minds.” “The important exercise that we need to do is to overcome the simplified understanding and understand what all happened in the run-up to the partition. It was not a simple redrawing of boundaries which happened in case of other countries,” Madhav said. He further stated, “Partition of minds needs to be addressed with utmost seriousness and care. We need to build one Indian society. One nationhood should be encouraged and within our country, we need to pull down the walls of mental separation and create one united society. Even with neighbours…we need not be enemies and we need to build bridges. Geo-physical boundaries can remain but the mental boundaries should be removed. Mental barriers that were created due to partition should be removed.” Vinay Sahasrabuddhe, MP and president of ICCR, said that observance of the Partition Horrors Remembrance Day would remind the current and future generations of the pains and efforts of those who tried to prevent the partition. “Without understanding the pains of partition, we cannot appreciate the importance of integration. In the past, there have been attempts to whitewash the events of partition, but PM Narendra Modi has given a voice to the anger, outrage and indignation against perpetrators of violence, through the Partition Horrors Remembrance Day,” Sahasrabuddhe said. Stating that “spiritual democracy” was essential, he added, “Spiritual democracy is where you consider every spiritual path equally and there is no hegemony. While promoting the cause of spiritual democracy, we cannot refuse to accommodate others. We need to create a global constituency for spiritual democracy.” Referring to the screening of a short presentation on the partition through photographs, Kumar said that many people were still living under the shadows of the partition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/important-to-sensitise-students-build-a-diverse-and-inclusive-society-jnu-vc/articleshow/86518966.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Gurgaon||ART of policing: Team of 5 Gurugram cops cracks 15 hit-&-runs in 6 months||GURUGRAM: A broken headlight, pipes protruding from a truck’s carriage, the name of a bakery embossed on a van. A team of five policemen trained in spotting blink-and-you-miss-it details like these on CCTV film has in six months cracked 15 “blind” hit-and-run cases. Set up this March, the dedicated Accident Response Team (ART) is the only such specialised unit in Haryana Police. The ART members, all Gurugram Police personnel, have undergone extensive training in scanning CCTV footage. The mandate of the ART, which is headed by a sub-inspector, is to probe only accident cases, many of which remain unsolved or see the accused get away due to lack of witnesses and evidence. The ART is the brainchild of DCP (Manesar) Varun Singla, who lost five relatives to a road accident in 2013. “I understand the pain families affected by accidents feel,” said Singla. ART helps victims get compensationDCP (Manesar) Varun Singla, the brain behind the initiative, said the ART also does the painstaking paperwork that helps victims claim compensation. The objective of setting up the unit, he said, was also to act as a deterrent because anyone driving rashly will know the ART will come after them. One of the first cases this unit took up was an accident that happened on March 23 night when a 12-year-old boy injured in a hit-and-run in Pataudi died on the way to hospital. The team found CCTV feed from a camera installed outside a school near the accident site and zeroed in on a truck that had passed the area around the same time. The numberplate was not legible because it was dark. But the cargo provided some clues, The ART inferred they needed to look for a truck carrying sewage pipes. "We searched all factories in the area that make such pipes and questioned their employees. When we were done with all pipe manufacturers in Gurugram, some of our officers travelled to adjoining Rewari and showed the truck’s footage to factory workers there. One of the manufacturers identified the truck. They shared the details of the vehicle and its owner. The driver was arrested in a couple of days," said sub-inspector Harpal, who leads the ART. The leads didn’t always come from scanning CCTV footage. There was good, old-fashioned sleuthing too. In June, a 32-year-old technician of a leading automobile company died after being hit by a van on the Delhi-Gurugram expressway in Narsinghpur. When the ART took up the probe, it found there was no camera that was focused on the accident site. The technician was on a two-wheeler that the truck had rammed into. "We questioned a number of people who had seen the accident from a distance. No one had jotted down the number of the van, but some of them said it was ferrying bakery items,” said Harpal. “So, we scanned CCTV footage from nearby areas for a van with bakery items and found a van that had the name of a baker on it. We questioned the company officials, and the vehicle and its driver were eventually traced,” Harpal added. In another case of hit and run in Farukhnagar, the only clue the cops had was a piece of broken headlight at the accident spot. They deduced it belonged to a truck. All police checkposts in the vicinity were alerted. The vehicle with a broken headlight was spotted near a toll plaza on KMP Expressway, two and half hours from the accident spot. Investigations in hit-and-run cases also involve filling up an exhaustive form, which includes the most minute details of an accident spot. Officers in the team need to note down details such as the position of the vehicle during the accident, position of the victim, the lane on which the crash took place, the width of the road, the impact on traffic and other circumstantial evidence. Some of this evidence becomes key to facilitating compensation for the victim’s family. “The investigating officer is required to submit all these details in court. On the basis of these, compensation is awarded. There have been many cases where the victims’ families have not been able to get compensation because of the lack of such minute details,” said Singla. “It’s not just catching the accused, ensuring the affected families get compensation is also part of our job. For that, we need to record each and every detail, even the ones that may seem unimportant,” said the DCP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/art-helps-victims-get-compensation/articleshow/86521346.cms||---
---||Delhi||Rohini court shootout: Two held from safehouse for shooters, CCTV shows car||NEW DELHI: The investigation into Friday’s shootout inside a Rohini court has led the cops to a getaway car and its driver, who was to escort the two shooters to a safehouse, a flat around 3km away from the court, after their escape from the crime scene. The original plan, sources said, required the shooters to create a stampede-like situation in the court by firing multiple shots in the air after killing Gogi. They had been asked to take hostage a lawyer or litigant, if required, and storm out of the court so that they could be driven to the safehouse. But the plan unravelled with the cops shooting back at the assailants almost immediately. Delhi Police on Saturday apprehended two suspects and are interrogating them to get to the others who were part of the plot. The duo — Umang and Vinay — are occupants of the flat in question and are accused of harbouring the shooters, a source said. The flat was rented a few months ago and was used by the shooters to conduct reconnaissance of the court premises, finalise the escape route and carry out a dry run. Cops to quiz key gangsters for Gogi murder inside courtAn old member of slain gangster Gogi's gang told TOI on Saturday that they had identified one of Sunil Tajpuria's henchman, a gym trainer, who was present outside the court with the getaway vehicle to help the shooters flee. He vowed revenge. The policemen had also spotted a suspicious vehicle during analysis of CCTV footage from the cameras around the court. Crime Branch sleuths visited the crime scene on Saturday and will soon move to interrogate gangsters Sunil Tajpuria, alias Tillu, Sunil Rathi, Naveen Bali and Neeraj Bawana. TOI has in possession the FIR lodged by Delhi Police on a complaint by SI Vir Singh from the 3rd battalion of Delhi Armed Police, which escorts criminals from jail to court. The cop has said in the FIR that several innocent people could have lost their lives if there was no immediate police retaliation against the two assailants. SI Singh, who was part of the team engaged in the exchange of fire, said in his statement that since the two assailants were armed and were firing indiscriminately, it was not possible for the police team to nab them "physically", especially when the judge, court staff and advocates were inside the courtroom and anyone could have died. Singh's team had brought the very-high-risk undertrial Gogi to Rohini court from Tihar as he had to be produced for his case hearing on Friday afternoon. They were also accompanied by police personnel from the Special Cell. According to the FIR, additional sessions judge Gagandeep Singh was engaged in court proceedings and the court staff and around 5-6 advocates were inside the room when suddenly two men, who were dressed as lawyers and were seated, stood up, whipped out their pistols and started firing. Keeping in mind the safety and security of everyone, Singh and his commandos — constables Shakti and Chirag — immediately opened fire at the two men. Simultaneously, personnel from the special cell and the Rohini special staff also fired, the FIR states. The incident left three persons — gangster Jitender Gogi and the two shooters, Rahul and Jaideep — dead on the spot. During interrogation, accused Umang has told the cops that he was also present at the court on Friday, wearing a lawyer’s attire to help the two shooters. He said that Gogi’s rival, Sunil Tajpuria, had asked him to help the two shooters in an assignment. The shooters came to his flat on September 20. On Friday morning, they went to a mall in Rohini to change into the lawyer’s attire. Umang being an LLB student already had the dress.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cops-to-quiz-key-gangsters-for-gogi-murder-inside-court/articleshow/86521349.cms||Rajshekhar Jha

Additionally, after every rain spell, the water level of the river rises and the waste gets washed away in the river, contaminating the water body. Also, stray animals and birds can often be seen feeding on the garbage. presenting an unpleasant site. Locals say that the town’s population had increased over the years and so has its daily garbage generation but the waste treatment capacity has largely remained the same. The municipal council officials told TOI that the waste treatment machine installed near the river has been lying defunct and therefore, the height of the garbage pile is rising every day. People living in the Nursery Road locality, close to the river, are the worst affected. “We live in the constant fear of catching dengue and other waterborne and mosquito-borne diseases. The untreated waste pile also makes us vulnerable to the Covid-19 threat,” Hitesh Pundir, a resident of Nursery Road locality, told TOI. Shivam Negi, a Srinagar-based social worker, said, “Despite several requests, the municipal council has not taken any concrete step to get rid of the garbage mountain.” Meanwhile, Dr Vineet Chandra Posti, ward member, Alaknanda Vihar, told TOI, “The municipal council is planning to shift the garbage dumping zone from the river bank to Girgaon village, seven kilometres from Srinagar. At present, the road leading to the village is unmetalled but I have written to the district magistrate and the MLA to get the stretch fixed. Once the road is constructed, trucks can take garbage to the village and in the process, reduce the waste pile near Alaknanda.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/srinagar-locals-irked-with-waste-pile-near-alaknanda/articleshow/86515193.cms||---

Now, the elephants have started to retreat to the relief of the villagers and forest department officials. While the foresters are yet to work out why the herd chose a forgotten corridor to come to Mohammadi after a gap of three decades, they were worried where the herd was heading to as there are no forests beyond Mohammadi. The area is now a densely populated settlement. All that they could do was to monitor their movement. “Most of the elephants have entered the buffer forests of Dudhwa Tiger Reserve,” said Anil Patel, deputy director, DTR (buffer). “The herd has reached Khareta beat after crossing National Highway-730 and is heading towards Kishanpur Wildlife Sanctuary. My team is monitoring them from a safe distance and ensuring the elephants are not disturbed as they may get angry and change their path.” An earlier report had said calves had been spotted in the herd, which could turn the elephants protective and aggressive. The DFO expected the herd to stay on at Kishanpur as crossing the rain-fed river Sharda into Nepal could be risky at this point of time. While all are happy that not a single human casualty took place, the elephants have left a trail of destruction. Some 15 farmers’ cane crops have been destroyed with an estimated loss worth over Rs 20 lakh. “We will conduct a survey of the fields trampled by the elephants and write to the district administration and senior forest officials for providing compensation to the affected farmers,” said Patel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/after-72-hr-stay-wild-elephants-retreat-from-mohammadi-in-kheri/articleshow/86515188.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

An FIR was lodged against all the nine accused under Section 147, 148, 149, 307 and 302 of IPC who, Babloo claimed, had absconded. As per Jhansi SSP Shivhari Meena, after the incident came to light, heavy police force along with dog squad and forensic team had reached the spot. “We smelled something fishy right from the beginning. Upon detailed investigation, we found many facts that did not corroborate the story narrated by Babloo,” said the SSP. Later on, after sustained interrogation based on forensic facts, Babloo broke down and admitted his crime. He confessed that he killed his daughter on Friday morning near the river in Dhaura village just to falsely implicate his ex-paramour and his brother. He did this after he had a breakup with his paramour who was one of the accused in the case earlier. He had an affair with the woman for over a decade. In past months, the woman had withdrawn from the relationship. In addition, Babloo had lent Rs 30,000 to her brother which he hadn’t returned. Thereafter, Babloo hatched a heinous plan to eliminate his daughter and implicate the rival party. “We have arrested Babloo for the murder of his daughter on the basis of his acceptance of the crime and other vital proofs. We have further added Sections 376 (3), 201 of IPC and Section 3/4 (2) of POCSO Act to the FIR,” said the SSP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/man-confesses-to-have-killed-his-daughter-arrested/articleshow/86516245.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

There were 37 cases of the disease in August and 15 in July in the city. It is a disease caused by the bite of a specific kind of a mite. “If a patient complains of high grade fever with chills, bodyache, muscle pain with rashes, it could be scrub typhus. If someone closely examines and finds a small mark that looks like cigarette burn anywhere on the body, especially on legs and hands, it could be scrub typhus. The place where the mite bites turns black just like a cigarette leaves a mark,” said Dr Narrottam Sharma, chief medical health officer (Jaipur-I). Good news is that the city has not reported any deaths related to scrub typhus, which is a non-communicable disease. Doctors say it is a preventable disease. The mite which causes scrub typhus is commonly found in grassy and bushy areas. “People, while going out in grassy areas like a playground, should wear full pants and shoes,” said a health department official. So far in 2021, Jaipur has reported 201 scrub typhus cases (till September 20), while the state reported 804 cases. According to the health department reports, 30 persons had died of scrub typhus in 2018. In 2019, the deaths were 12 and in 2020, one patient died. Docs concerned about phone snatching Sawai Man Singh medical college staff expressed their concern over the rising incidents of phone snatching from doctors and patients’ attendants.

This comes a day after district guardian minister Eknath Shinde reviewed the situation of pothole-riddled roads in Thane and warned of severe action against those responsible. A parallel probe will be conducted on works under the supervision of MMRDA, MSRDC and PWD, Shinde said on Saturday. Arjun Ahire, city engineer with TMC informed junior engineer Sandeep Gaikwad, executive engineer Prakash Khadtare, deputy engineer Sandeep Sawant and executive engineer Chetan Patel were placed under suspension by municipal commissioner Dr Vipin Sharma for dereliction of duty over the poor condition of roads. Officials, quoting the order, said the engineers were responsible for proper maintenance of roads and checking quality of repair work, which they failed to do. “Road repairs are sanctioned with adequate budget but if the work done is substandard and engineers do not supervise it properly, it will not be tolerated,” Shinde said. A special task force has been set up under the Thane collector for coordinating and resolving all road related issues in the region.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/4-thane-municipal-corporation-engineers-blamed-for-poor-road-work-suspended/articleshow/86519023.cms||Manoj Badgeri

A sub inspector and three constables were injured in the attack. An FIR has been registered against 27 people for the attack. Trouble started when the police team went to arrest one Satendra, a resident of Kashiram Nagar under Majhola police station, on Thursday. He and his accomplices allegedly attacked the team and pelted stones at it. Police said a woman had lodged a complaint against Satendra for allegedly harassing and assaulting her, besides damaging her two-wheeler. Pradeep Kumar, SI, Kashiram Nagar police outpost, Majhola, said, “We had reached the area after getting a tip about the accused being at home. We spotted him roaming outside his house. He started misbehaving and attacked the police team. Soon, his accomplices joined him in pelting stones at me and constables Sumit, Nikhil and Sanjiv.

The historic railway shed which used to house living, dining and bedroom bogies of a train which the erstwhile ruler of Baroda state Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III used to travel to Bombay will be soon demolished to pave way for the new station for the Ahmedabad-Mumbai bullet train. Sources in the National High Speed Rail Corporation Limited (NHSRCL) which is implementing the bullet train project confirmed that the structure will be razed. In fact, platform number seven and residential and commercial establishments near the Pandya bridge have already been demolished for the project. The railway shed has been covered with a long green shade net indicating that the building will be soon brought down. “The said railway shed is in the footprints of proposed Vadodara HSR station. The structure is in dilapidated condition and also unsafe due to proximity to the running railway and road traffic. Presently, NHSRCL has submitted the application for its possession and approval is in process with the competent authorities,” NHSRCL spokesperson Sushma Gaur told TOI. Ironically, plans to provide a facelift to the dilapidated structure were prepared twice. In 2009, Barodians were told that the historic railway shed will be turned into a city heritage museum which would be ready by 2010. The then district administration led by district collector Vijay Nehra, the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) and city-based Heritage Trust had drawn out a draft MoU which envisaged that using Rs 1 crore from MP’s funds and another Rs 1 crore from the district collectorate, the dilapidated building will be restored, new extension will be done along with plush interiors to convert it into museum. The plan was to construct the city museum in such a way that it houses five galleries along with a ramp that divides the building in two parts with three galleries on the ground level and two at the upper level. But the proposal made no headway till 2015 when the then district collector Avantika Singh tried to revive the project by roping in corporate donors but all in vein. “In fact, Vadodara Heritage Society was constituted by former collector Avantika Singh. It included all the stakeholders in heritage management and conservation as also the major custodians of the built heritage of the city including the railways, the VMC among others. Unfortunately, that file is buried somewhere between the Kothi Kacheri and Khanderao market,” said Sameer Khera, president of Heritage Trust.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/royal-railway-shed-to-make-way-for-bullet-train-station/articleshow/86515266.cms||Prashant Rupera
---||Delhi||Delhi govt launches campaign to ensure food safety during festivals||NEW DELHI: Delhi government has started a food safety campaign during the festival season to ensure that food joints in the capital offer only quality food. During festivals, some food business operators and others dealing in food items tend to compromise with quality to cash in on the spurt in demands. In April last year, around 500 people in east Delhi fell sick and had to be rushed to hospital after they started vomiting after eating spoiled buckwheat flour. Food safety officials have been asked to collect samples of buckwheat flour, paneer and other food items from different places in the capital so that sale of spoiled food items can be checked. The demand of buckwheat flour significantly grows due to its use in the Navratri festival, which is beginning from October 7 this year. Food safety commissioner of Delhi government Nehal Bansal says that people who consume spoiled buckwheat flour (kuttu atta) are likely to fall ill. “It is easy for loose kutta atta which is not properly stored to get spoiled because chances of fungal growth in loose flour are high. The fungus produces aflatoxin that is harmful for health,” Bansal said. Another officer said people should prefer packed kuttu four to avoid chances of any fungal infection. The food safety department is also running a special campaign against reusing cooking oil, a common practice in restaurants. A team will collect food samples from different food joints, especially street food joints, for quality check, and monitor the food quality. An official claimed that some of the big restaurants sell used cooking oil to street food vendors who then reuse the used cooking oil that is dangerous to health. “The cooking oil should not be reused because it can endanger our lives with cardiovascular diseases. Food safety department is now monitoring all food business operators across the capital involved in frying of oil like namkeen, bhature wale, etc, and also making them aware about the RUCO plan in Delhi,” said the official. Food Safety and Standards Authority of India has launched Repurpose Used Cooking Oil campaign, which is aimed to enable collection of used cooking oil from food business operators and converting them into biodiesel. The food safety officers in the districts have been asked to visit marketplaces and check samples of kuttu atta to ensure it is not spoiled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/govt-launches-campaign-to-ensure-food-safety-during-festivals/articleshow/86517036.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Hope brings youth back to family fold after 7 years||AHMEDABAD: It was only hope that kept the Makwanas going. Their son Mohit, 19, had disappeared from his medical college in Surendranagar in 2014. After seven years, a missing person can be declared legally dead – a window which had got over in July. But the couple from Mangrol in Junagadh district refused to give up, and their faith bore fruit when they were reunited with their son. Credit for this reunion goes to Jugal Purohit, DSP with Junagadh police, who had handled the case when he was an inspector with the state CID (crime). “The family’s village was under my jurisdiction. They were constantly in touch with me in 2016-18. However, we had no leads. It was apparent that Mohit had left on his own. But the family had taken several vows. His mother had not worn footwear for the past seven years,” he said. When the Makwanas again requested him to look into the case, Purohit knew he had no jurisdiction as the original case was registered in Surendranagar district, and he was no more in CID. However, in order to honour the sentiments of the family, Purohit decided to give it a try. He had Mohit’s Aadhaar number. So, he went to a nearby vaccination centre and requested them if they could check the vaccination status linked to the Aadhaar number. To his surprise, Mohit had taken the Covid vaccine at a centre in Thane, Maharashtra. It was a significant discovery. Purohit requested Junagadh SP Raviteja Vasamshetty if he could probe further into the case. After getting the details, he also got in touch with his batchmate in Mumbai. The location of the centre was found to be near Ambernath, the local police were informed, and Mohit was traced to a nearby slum. Purohit and the Makwanas immediately went to Mumbai and brought him home. “It was an emotional day for me and the family as he had come back after seven years. His appearance had changed, but the family knew it was him,” said Purohit. Mohit’s questioning revealed that he did not do well in medical college. After failing to clear the second year, he was under tremendous pressure to succeed in the third year. So, he left college and went to Mumbai to find his destiny. He worked at several places doing odd jobs to survive, said investigators.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hope-brings-youth-back-to-family-fold-after-7-years/articleshow/86517041.cms||---

Justice Rekha Palli noted that the ultrasound report of the petitioner indicated that the child would suffer from various physical deformities and would require multiple corrective surgeries, which would expose him to numerous intraoperative and post-operative complications. “Since there is every likelihood that if the petitioner is not granted permission to terminate her pregnancy, grave psychological harm is likely to be caused to her. I am inclined to agree with the learned counsel for the petitioner that in the present case, the petitioner ought to be granted permission for termination of her pregnancy,” the court noted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-okays-22-week-fetus-termination/articleshow/86517034.cms||---

People from Ballari and surrounding districts including those in Andhra Pradesh depend on Vijayanagara Institute of Medical Science (VIMS) in Ballari to get their children treated. In recent days, there has been a spurt in children suffering from viral fever and VIMS is struggling to accommodate all. This has triggered a demand for a separate institute for child health for Ballari. VIMS has only 130 paediatrics beds, but now more than 300 patients are admitted here. Moreover, since VIMS is a tertiary care centre, most sick babies are being referred here from Ballari, Vijayanagara, Koppal, Raichur, Chitradurga and Andhra Pradesh. Most patients who come here are from below the poverty line. The Ballari district hospital doesn’t have adequate beds for children and many patients are forced to wait on the footpath during every viral infection season. Hence, people say there is an urgent need for a separate institute of child health in Ballari. Dr H Durgappa, HoD, the department of paediatrics at VIMS said the institute only has 130 beds including 14 ICUs, 8 HDU, and 90 general beds in the paediatric ward. “We also have 60 neonatal ICUs for newborn babies. But the patient load is almost three times our capacity with 300 patients and 150 newborn babies presently at VIMS. We have made temporary arrangements at the new dental college for children. We are finding difficulties in accommodating children and provide quality service to the patients,” he added. To provide quality medical service to children, Kalyana Karnataka needs a 400-bed institute of child health in Ballari, he said. “The institute will help save many lives not only from Ballari, but also entire North Karnataka,” he added. “Ballari district has received huge amount of mining compensation funds this year. The state should reserve at least Rs 100 crore to establish an institute of child health in Ballari and start this project without any delay,” urged Congress leader Nimbagal Ramakrishna.

In the letter, Tejashwi referred to the affidavit filed by the Centre in the Supreme Court stating that caste census in 2021 “would not be feasible”. “There has been a considerable debate and discussion recently on the importance of caste census. There is not a single reason against the desirability of caste census,” read a part of the letter. Among others, the letter has been addressed to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, NCP chief Sharad Pawar, former Uttar Pradesh chief ministers Akhilesh Singh and Mayawati, Tamil Nadu CM M K Stalin, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee, Odisha CM Navin Patnaik, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot and Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi. Among Bihar leaders, Tejashwi has sent letters to HAM(S) chief Jitan Ram Manjhi, Jamui MP Chirag Paswan, VIP founder Mukesh Sahani and AIMIM state president Akhtarul Iman. “Caste-based census would actually bring to the front the pressing concerns that a country like India must attend to with a sense of urgency. This is a historic opportunity before us to push for an agenda that is essential for making this country more just and egalitarian. It would play a pivotal role in ensuring social harmony and national cohesion,” Tejashwi wrote. Tejashwi said he was open to the suggestions and inputs of the non-BJP leaders so that a plan of action could be prepared immediately.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/force-centre-to-hold-caste-census-tejashwi-to-33-non-bjp-leaders/articleshow/86513895.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Ottapalam sub-collector Shikha Surendran had provided a report on the land records from the two village offices and krishi bhavans on the converted land. The agriculture minister P Prasad and revenue minister K Rajan had ordered an investigation on the complaint by Shoranur Padasekhara Samithy that 350 acre of wetland was converted by Shoranur municipality and a gazette notification was issued to make it dry land. The converted land includes three-crop paddy land near Shoranur-Cheruthuruthy check dam in Bharathapuzha, said C Biju, secretary of the Padasekhara Samithy in his complaint. The collector has also ordered the restoration of converted land using the earlier gazatte notification. The report of the collector castigated the officials of the municipality and the krishi bhavans for fabricating documents, not getting the sanction of local-level monitoring committee for wetland conversion and their failure in following rules and procedures in such land conversions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/collector-cancels-wetland-conversion-in-shoranur/articleshow/86517069.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Meerut||Carving magic on wood: Evolving through centuries in Uttar Pradesh's Saharanpur||SAHARANPUR: Like a monk in prayer, Mohammad Bahar, 60, is in meditative mode, crouched on a cemented floor under a tin shade located near Barelvi Madrassa in UP’s Saharanpur. His ageing fingers adeptly hold chisel and hammer, deftly furrowing through a wooden piece, carving exquisite floral designs that the city’s woodcraft has been famous for. “I have been into wood carving for 52 years now. I was just 8 when I began. During those days, the boys of my age had no interest in education and we grew up observing our elders working on wood, producing intricate designs as our ears got used to the incessant sound of carving throughout the day. It was music to our ears and still is,” reminisces Bahar, a third-generation craftsman and a product of Ustad-Shaagird tradition that still produces some of the finest craftsmen in the city. “Our woodcraft industry runs on the age-old tradition and my ustad was my father himself,” adds Bahar who works on contract basis for traders. He belongs to the strong community of artisans, backbone of Rs 400 crore industry thriving in the border district of Uttar Pradesh and caters to markets around the globe. Though the locals say the craft was introduced in India with the arrival of the Mughals and flourished rapidly in the various regions that came under Mughal influence, Atta Hussain, an immigrant from Multan, is said to have established the first organised wood carving unit in 1882 in Saharanpur that over the years led to the elevation of the city as the hub of woodcraft. Saharanpur Wood Carving Association (SWCA) president Mohammad Irfan-Ul-Haq said, “Earlier, the carving patterns were largely influenced by Kashmiri designs, finely shaped screens and jaali work, anguri, elaborate floral, tarkashi, takai, chilayi, etc. Over a period, changing times cast their shadow upon the industry. Today, it is all about the modern forms of designing. In fact, the design in Saharanpur woodwork is dominated by natural motifs such as trees, flowers, creepers, and, of course, leaves. We use it a lot in our designs and twist and turn it to give it different styles. Earlier, the favourite woods for carving used to be teakwood, mango wood, etc, but today more have been added to the list such as deodar, ebony, redwood, rosewood, red cedar, sal and pines.” Though the industry is recognised worldwide with orders coming from Europe, Middle East and America, the pandemic has had a drastic impact on the workforce here. “We are daily wage workers and depend entirely on the woodcraft industry. Covid has crippled us financially and prolonged lockdowns have only added to our predicament. People moved to other vocations, trying to look for other venues. But now that normalcy is returning, orders are also being received in the industry and many of us have re-joined. However, some of the artisans don't want the next generation to continue in the woodcraft due to financial and health reasons,” said Wakar Ahmad, a 48-year-old artisan. As this work has a set history of transferring the carving talent to the future generations, is it still prevailing? No! Mohammad Naushad, 51, a famous miniature carving designer who has been in the field for the last 44 years, says, “I would not want my children to leave their education and get involved in the carving industry. I don't want to replace the pen in their hand with a carving tool. Education has benefits which I miss now, but it's too late for me. My children should go out and explore the world. There is so much to do. The meagre income of mere Rs 350 per day of hard work is not enough to even make both ends meet. Besides, the 10-hour work shift on the floor, 6 days a week, to get a maximum of ₹350 per day, requires us to bend for hours, straining our backs and necks. Working without safety equipment such as masks or shades means that sawdust frequently ends up in our eyes or lungs, causing irritation and infections. We usually eat jaggery to keep our throats clear.” However, not everyone thinks this way. Some youngsters have recognised the potential this art carries and have found innovative ways to expand the business that they have inherited. To strengthen and spread their business, they took its presence online to get orders from countries like the US, Europe (mainly Germany), Canada, UK, Australia, Mexico, Finland, the Middle East and others.

---||Vadodara||A Testimony of Baroda’s railway journey||Vadodara: For onlookers, the railway shed or saloon might be just another run down structure that people usually see near railway stations. But in reality, this railway shed is a testimony of Vadodara’s journey from the era of the erstwhile Gaekwad Baroda State Railway (GBSR) to the present day Indian Railways (IR). Railways has over 150 years of history with Vadodara after Maharaja Khanderao Gaekwad, the erstwhile ruler of Baroda state, conceived a line when there was no narrow gauge line. Dabhoi-Miyagam line that was started during the tenure of Khanderao Gaekwad was the first narrow gauge line that was initially surveyed for transporting opium.

---||Delhi||Feminist icon Kamla Bhasin, who gave women ‘azadi’ slogan, no more||Kamla Bhasin (1946-2021), renowned feminist, poet and social scientist, passed away in New Delhi on Saturday morning. Kamla, the great survivor, is gone. A woman who survived so many personal tragedies but laughed, cried and smiled through them all, retaining the sheer joy for life. She lived through a difficult divorce, a fight to retain a share of the house, the burden of caring for a son with disability and, worst of all, the death of her lovely young daughter. A lesser woman would have crumbled. Yet through it all, Kamla Bhasin carried on her extraordinary work for the women’s movement, for peace, equality and social justice. Kamla boldly questioned patriarchy and its myriad forms within the family and society. And she did it in her inimitable style, speaking and writing colloquially. She was the woman who gave us the azadi slogan that was the cry at so many women’s rallies, “Meri behnen maange azadi, patriarchy se azadi, family se azadi...” Her songs were slogans, or should we say her slogans were songs? “Tod, tod ke bandhanon ko dekho behnen aati hain...” still resounds in my ears. Born in a Punjabi doctor’s family, Kamla got a postgraduate degree in Rajasthan and then studied development sociology in Germany. She returned to work with an NGO in Rajasthan. This early training in grassroots work stood her in good stead. In 1979, she joined the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and her work enabled her to travel across South Asia, identifying innovative work by people’s organisations. She worked in Bangladesh for a while with the public health organisation, Gonoshasthaya Kendra. Her three decades with the FAO gave her access to the wider world and connected her to international donors and funders whom she tapped for helping NGOs and feminist organisations in India. Only a livewire like Kamla, full of energy and spunk, could have juggled both a long career with the UN and a starring role in the women’s movement. She travelled extensively and addressed innumerable training workshops, conferences and seminars. She wrote several books, including some for children, with progressive feminist messages built into them. Kamla was a superb networker who forged friendships with feminists across South Asia and the world. In particular, she boldly reached out to feminists in Pakistan from groups like the Women’s Action Forum and the Aurat Foundation. A firm believer in peace, she supported many initiatives by civil society organisations working for peace between the two countries. In 2005, she took up the “1000 Women for the Nobel Peace Prize” project which honoured women from Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, India and other countries. She was a founder of the women’s organisation, Jagori, and much later set up Sangat, a feminist network dedicated to gender justice, equality and peace. In recent years, Kamla was a convenor of ‘One Billion Rising’ that mobilises people against violence against women. She supported anti-communalism work and peace building in communities, speaking up strongly against fascism and authoritarianism. Kamla, the bold Punjabi woman with her quips and jokes and ‘jhappis’, her “never say die” spirit. I cannot believe she is dead. May her pioneering work live on!||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/feminist-icon-kamla-bhasin-who-gave-women-azadi-slogan-no-more/articleshow/86517089.cms||---

At its 126th annual general meeting (AGM) on Friday, the proposal to develop the Gymkhana’s project at Sadapur in Lonavla was approved. Apart from a tennis, football and an Olympic-size basketball court, the four-acre plot on the banks of Indrani river will also house jogging and cycling tracks, among other facilities. “The need for a Gymkhana outside the city was felt by many members. It will not only serve the members but will even help generate revenues for the Gymkhana,” said Islam Gymkhana’s president Advocate Yusuf Abrahni, adding that existing members will automatically become members at the Lonavla branch too. It is being touted as the ideal getaway location, as Lonavla will attract guests from both Mumbai and Pune. Member and businessman Sabir Nirman said, “It will give a good opportunity to unwind with family and friends on weekends because it is secluded, outside the city, and yet not very far.” Architect Rakhshan Khan claimed “global standard” is being maintained in the Gymkhana’s construction. “There will be row houses and apartments too. The stay there will give the feel of a five-star hotel, with facilities like concierge and room service,” Khan said. Phase one of the project is scheduled for completion in the next two years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sobos-islam-gymkhana-to-get-lonavla-branch-soon/articleshow/86519133.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin
---||Mumbai||800 plus potholes officially in Mumbai,‘many more unreported’||MUMBAI: This monsoon the city has reported close to 1,000 pothole complaints officially although citizens have said that a larger number may have gone unreported. Many citizens and elected representatives have said that driving through the city has become increasingly difficult. The civic body allows citizens to raise complaints regarding potholes on BMC--maintained roads via various platforms like Twitter where the complainant can tag the @mybmc handle or on BMC’s website http:// www.mybmcpotholefixit.com/. Data from BMC’s website shows that from June till September 24 the total number of complaints reported were 822. Last year, in the same period 848 complaints were reported while in 2019 there were 795 complaints. Crompton Texeira (74), a Kalina resident, said that he hires an autorickshaw to commute around the locality and has been finding almost every road full of small, multiple potholes. “I have a slipped disc issue and with these bumpy roads it makes things worse. The bigger problem is the poor manner in which filling of potholes is done due to lack of ssupervision,” said Texeira. TimesViewPotholes following wet spells have been a recurring problem in Mumbai for years. None of the hot or cold mixes by BMC have been able to prevent them. Considering the number of vehicles on the city's roads and considering the city’s fast-dwindling image as a global city, road repair and improvement works must have quality and if it is not ensured, those responsible for the mess should be blacklisted and penalized.King Circle resident Nikhil Desai said crores are spent every year on repair and maintenance of roads but the city has not got good quality and motorable roads. “There is no proper method even to fill potholes and in no time the filling comes out. If one complains to authorities they keep passing the buck from one department to another,” he said. Mulund MLA Mihir Kotecha said that the road condition is such that it recently took three hours to travel from Nariman Point to Mulund. “Many say they are forced to take the road with railways refusing single tickets to travellers,” said Kotecha. Shantanu Kulkarni, director of Probity Soft, the firm which operates the BMC website http:// www.mybmcpotholefixit.com/ said citizens can raise their complaints on the website so that civic officials can act on it accordingly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-800-potholes-officially-many-more-unreported/articleshow/86519178.cms||Richa Pinto

Trichy Corporation officials attributed the increase to wedding and other events.While Srirangam and Ariyamangalam zones report relatively fewer cases, K Abishekapuram and Ponmalai zones are accounting for more than 50% of the fresh cases being reported daily. Between September 18 and 20, the city was reporting only 10-17 fresh infections. But after September 21, the cases have doubled with about 32 to 46 being recorded in the past four days. Officials said that people attending events like weddings and engagements have been turning positive. “Most of those who tested positive are unvaccinated or vaccinated with first dose alone. Since all commercial establishments are open, it is difficult to identify the exact source of infection,” a health official said. Meanwhile, a containment zone has been established in an apartment in Thillai Nagar. A banner has been placed to caution the visitors while entrances remain open. Officials said that a family of four has tested positive with two hospitalised. “Those who were hospitalised are in safe health condition. Home isolation was allowed only if the person was asymptomatic and non-comorbid,” the official added. Corporation also expressed concern over the deviation in the standard operating procedures (SoP) in public places, particularly in commercial streets where social distancing goes for a toss. An official said that vulnerable spots will be scrutinised.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/covid-cases-up-in-trichy-city-containment-zone-returns/articleshow/86519135.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: GO 111 land now hot real estate destinations||HYDERABAD: Most of Moinabad could be bound by the ‘no-construction’ rule of GO 111. Yet over the last year or two, the area – a 40-minute drive from the financial district – has turned into a realty hotspot. Markets indicate land prices have, parallelly, shot by over 50% to touch Rs 2 crore per acre (approx) on an average. In Shankerpally, the rates are higher --- anywhere between Rs 3 and 5 crore per acre. A sizeable part of this locality too is covered by GO 111. When TOI travelled through Moinabad and Shankerpally recently, it found ‘plots for sale’ boards generously peppered across its villages, apart from under-construction farmhouses, warehouses and villas. Conversations with locals revealed that real estate activity has picked up tremendous pace post the Covid-19 outbreak, with many among Hyderabad’s rich eyeing bigger homes with greener surroundings – far from the core city limits. “We have closed about 100 deals in the last one year,” said local realtor, M Mahinder, who TOI caught up with in Himayat Nagar, Moinabad. He seemed unfazed when questioned about the legality of these transactions. “Everybody is buying here. In fact, the village bylanes get clogged over the weekend with people either driving to their homes in luxury cars, or visiting a prospective property,” he added. There are also those who’ve bought land here but are holding onto to them in hope of the GO being dissolved, say locals. “They are not going ahead with with construction now but are almost certain that GO 111 will be scrapped soon,” said Burra Narsimha, an agriculturalist. A group of farmers, sitting around, chipped in with similar observations. “It is good that the government is not allowing companies to set shop here. They would pollute the area. But what about these people who are building homes. Is the GO not applicable to them,” asked 60-year-old Narasimhalu K who grows cotton to make a living. Realtors say that the lack of monitoring by authorities coupled with limited awareness about GO 111 among buyers, are reasons driving the residential market here. “Now with land in the core city becoming very expensive, plots in Moinabad and Shankerpally are selling like hot cake. Many mid-segment realtors tell their clients that 10% construction is allowed even on GO 111 area and mislead them,” said a real estate consultant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/go-111-land-now-hot-real-estate-destinations/articleshow/86517104.cms||Sudipta Sengupta

Over 16 lakh candidates are likely to sit for the exam that will be held in two shifts in 4,200 centres across the state. It will be the biggest exam ever conducted by the state government in a single day. “I wish all the best to all the candidates appearing in REET. You all should believe in yourself and give your exam with patience. Don’t believe in any rumours and inform police if you see any unlawful activities,” chief minister Ashok Gehlot tweeted. Throughout the day, all the seven divisional commissioners — Ajmer, Bharatpur, Bikaner, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Kota and Udaipur — announced to suspend the Internet in their respective zones from 6am to 6pm. Jaipur divisional commissioner Dinesh Kumar Yadav said based on inputs and requests from district collectors of Jhunjhunu, Dausa, Sikar and Jaipur, the decision to suspend Internet was taken. “It is part of a preventive measure to ensure that the exam is conducted in a fair manner,” said Yadav. Sources said Jaipur city had been kept out of the purview of the ban to ensure that the control room and other law enforcement agencies have smooth exchange of information. “The local administrations have been given instructions that they should provide information to candidates at the makeshift bus stands. Police patrolling vehicles also must provide basic information to candidates to avoid any inconvenience,” said Yadav. Rajasthan Board of Secondary Education (RBSE), which is conducting the exam, passed on final instructions to all centres on Saturday evening. RBSE chairman DP Jaroli said this was the biggest exam the state had ever conducted. “I understand the pain many candidates are going through in reaching their respective centres. Strict rules are only meant to ensure that the most deserving candidate is selected,” said Jaroli. The board has formed a control room in its office in Ajmer to monitor the progress throughout the day. This is for the first time officials undertaking the exam are under the intense pressure as any unlawful event inside the examination halls could lead to their dismissal. Officials conducting the exam are also not allowed to carry mobile phones inside the centres. Civil society groups have come forward to help students by providing free accommodation, meals, medicines and water. Following CM Gehlot’s appeal that citizens shouldn’t travel on Sunday unless it is extremely important, there have been mass cancellations of train and bus tickets and several social events have been postponed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/internet-ban-today-from-6am-6pm-barring-jaipur/articleshow/86519191.cms||---

Currently, only the top institutes such as the IITs offer a joint PhD programme where students are guided by faculty members from various foreign varsities. “Students seeking PhD admissions in University of Hyderabad will be given an option of whether they want to go for a conventional PhD or a joint PhD.

An MTech in modelling in simulation and design and a certificate course in publication in collaboration with the Cambridge Press are also in the pipeline. “Internationalization is one of the key goals of the university’s IoE status. All these courses are being primarily introduced to attract foreign students so that University of Hyderabad’s visibility improves at a global level and to amplify skill sets of Indian students to make them competitive globally. This would eventually help us inch closer to better global rankings,” said Prof Nayyar, adding that some of these programmes have been approved by academic council and some are at the planning stage.

However, single-screen cinema halls may not resume operations over mounting losses. “Single-screen theatres will not open till the government gives them subsidies or concessions. We took this decision based on expenditure on sanitization and following SOPs, cap on seating capacity and losses already suffered by us,” Deepak Kudale, former president of Cinema Owners and Exhibitors Association of India, said. There are 17 single-screen theatres and three biplexes in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad. Prakash Chaphalkar, secretary of the Multiplex Association of India (MAI), told TOI that multiplexes across the state have suffered huge losses as they were operational for only a few weeks in the past 18 months. “We are happy that the chief minister has issued permission to reopen on October 22 and hope our businesses will return to normalcy by year-end,” he added. Neerav Panchamia, CEO, E-Square Leisure Private Limited, said they will soon begin deep-cleaning, sanitization and testing of all systems in their properties across Maharashtra.

To cut down the emission, officials were instructed by the TNPCB to install LPG-based burning mechanism. The civic body has planned to convert the infrastructure between October 1 and October 20. Till then, the residents were requested to utilise other corporation crematoriums at Konakkarai and Ambedkar Nagar (Srirangam). The Oyamari crematorium located on the banks of the Cauvery was sentimentally preferred by the residents. The facility cremates around 10 dead bodies every day. During the peak of Covid-19, around 15 dead bodies were cremated. Meanwhile, the residents have urged the authorities to improve the allied infrastructure such as parking facilities, waiting rooms and sanitary complexes. The approach road of the crematorium from Odathurai Road is unsafe, said the residents, while urging the authorities to streamline the entrance. As the LPG system is expected to increase the maintenance cost, local people have sought the civic body not to increase the cremation charge, which is fixed at Rs 1,500.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/oyamari-crematorium-to-switch-to-lpg-to-be-closed-for-20-days/articleshow/86519168.cms||---

Madhya Maharashtra and Konkan are also on a rain alert. As a result of the cyclone, the IMD has issued warning of heavy to very heavy rainfall with extremely heavy falls at isolated places over Vidarbha on September 27, heavy to very heavy rainfall at isolated places over Marathwada, and heavy rainfall at isolated places over Konkan and Goa, Madhya Maharashtra on that day. Thunderstorm accompanied with lightning is also very likely at isolated places over Madhya Maharashtra, Marathwada, Konkan and Goa during next 48 hours till September 27. On September 28, there is a heavy to very heavy rainfall alert for isolated places in Madhya Maharashtra and Konkan-Goa; and isolated heavy rain alert in Marathwada. Thunderstorms accompanied with lightning are also very likely at isolated places over Madhya Maharashtra, Marathwada, Konkan-Goa on September 28. Anupam Kashyapi, head of the weather forecasting division, IMD Pune, told TOI, “The deep depression over the northwest and adjoining westcentral Bay of Bengal moved nearly westwards at a speed of seven km per hour on Saturday and intensified into the cyclonic storm, Gulab, by evening. It is likely to move nearly westwards and cross north Andhra Pradesh-south Odisha coasts between Kalingapatnam and Gopalpur around evening of September 26 (Sunday).” Kashyapi said cyclonic storms were not very common during the monsoon. “An upper air cyclonic circulation over the Myanmar coast and the adjoining Gulf of Martaban a couple of days ago developed fast enough to transform into a well marked low pressure, then a depression, a deep depression and gradually a cyclonic storm (Gulab) on Saturday. The last cyclone that had affected our region was Yaas, a very severe cyclonic storm, in May this year,” said Kashyapi. The path of Gulab is such that it will mainly affect parts of south and east Maharashtra on September 27 and north and central Maharashtra on September 28. “By the time it moves towards north Maharashtra, its strength may weaken. The rain in Maharashtra from September 26 evening/night is likely to be a result of Gulab and its remnants,” he aid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/gulab-may-trigger-heavy-rain-in-parts-of-state-on-sept-27-28/articleshow/86517135.cms||Neha Madaan

We tried asking the Pune airport authorities and they said that the IAF had not clarified the dates. We thought it would be a risk to book a flight from Pune and decided to book it from Mumbai instead,” Sil, a Kharadi resident, said. Another resident Anshul Jadhav is also planning a trip next month. “I am not sure whether to book the tickets or wait till the runway closure dates are announced or if I should book a flight from Mumbai. Nowadays airlines take a lot of time to refund the ticket money and in many cases, they tell flyers to use it for future travel,” he said. The total runway closure was supposed to happen in April and May, but was postponed after requests by the airport officials in view of the transport of vaccines from Pune. Airport sources told TOI earlier that the closure was expected after Diwali, but no dates had been provided. “The Indian Air Force (IAF), which manages the runway of the airport, is carrying out the work. They haven’t informed us about any specific dates. We know that the flyers must be confused,” Pune airport director Santosh Dhoke said. The flight movements at the Pune airport have increased to 116 on most days. The number may increase further with the winter schedule and the vacation time approaching. Travel agents told TOI many passengers were in two minds about booking flights from Pune. “We have made eight reservations from Mumbai last week as flyers didn’t want to ta risk travelling from Pune,” a representative of a travel agency said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/flyers-book-tickets-from-mumbai-over-recarpeting-dates-confusion/articleshow/86517138.cms||Joy Sengupta

Wondering what they do all day, she asked her dad why these kids did not attend school. That is when her dad inspired her to grow up and become an IAS officer. He nudged her to be in the system to change it and bring about betterment. That was when third ranker Ankita Jain seeded the dream of becoming an IAS officer. On Friday, this Delhi family’s joy doubled as both daughters, engineers from Delhi Technological University and GATE (Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering) high scorers, secured UPSC ranks this year. Ankita’s younger sister, Vaishali Jain (26), secured rank 21. The journey for both has been long and arduous, but they were determined to crack the test. They shared their “never give up” attitude and their parents supported them through their fight. Ankita took the GATE in 2016, secured the first rank, worked for DRDO as a scientist, and earlier worked for an IT conglomerate in Bengaluru. “I took my first UPSC attempt in 2017 but I did not even clear my prelims. Without much ado, I started preparing for 2018,” said the 28-year-old Ankita. After securing rank 270, she joined the Indian audit and accounts service and was posted in Mumbai. With little time at hand, she attempted the exam again but failed the prelims. “This time when I took the exam, I had a very different mental state,” she added. And, that is all that mattered. Ankita aspires to go on to work with the sole motive of the nation’s betterment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sight-of-loitering-slum-kids-spurred-upsc-3rd-ranker/articleshow/86519203.cms||Hemali Chhapia

Chandran, hailing from Peringadoor near Mundathikode in the district, won the best actor award for his performance in the play ‘Venicile Vyapari’ in 2002. He has acted in a couple of films directed by Sathyan Anthikkad, like ‘Rasathanthram’, ‘Achuvinte Amma’, ‘Bhagyadevatha’ and ‘Innathe Chinthavishayam’. He also acted in films of Hariharan and P N Menon. In the film field he was known as Thrissur Chandran. “I requested Chandran to act in my films after seeing his performance in one of the plays of the popular troupe ‘Kalanilayam’. He was a talented actor and a well-behaved person on the film sets. His talents were recognised late but not fully utilised. Though he acted in relatively minor roles, he could leave lasting impressions on the audience by his impressive performance,” said Sathyan. He is survived by wife, a son and daughter. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/actor-thrissur-chandran-dead/articleshow/86517140.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Fountains dried & rusted, Hyderabad beauty plan goes bust||HYDERABAD: The once gurgling fountains set up as part of city’s beautification project have now turned into an eyesore. Dry, rusted, covered in moss and slowly ebbing away, they can be easily spotted at some of the major thoroughfares, central medians and junctions. In 2019, about Rs 50 lakh was spent to restore fountains at 25 road junctions and 65 central medians, but they are almost defunct again. Each of these fountains was repaired at the cost of Rs 1 lakh to Rs 3 lakh at the time, officials said. The neglect by civic authorities is exemplified by the fountain at the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation head office, lying defunct and crying for water for quite a while now. While three sets of fountains not far from the governor’s abode on Raj Bhavan have moss for company and their water has become a safe shelter for mosquitoes to multiply. Fountains near Telugu Talli flyover, Tank Bund, behind Ambedkar statue near Tank Bund, Masab Tank, Rajiv Gandhi statue in Somajiguda, near Marriott Hotel, Gulzar House near Charminar and Rose fountain in Lakdi-ka-pul are also pretty much in the same boat. “This is nothing but public money going down the drain. If they are doing something to beautify the city, aren’t they supposed to maintain them on a regular basis? It is shocking how the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation is turning a blind eye to fountains that are dysfunctional in their head office and historic places such as Charminar,” said Harish Daga, a social activist. Agreeing that some fountains were affected, Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation’s urban biodiversity wing official V Srinivas said, “We are repairing fountains on a regular basis, but there are places where we are not able to carry out repairs as roads need to be drilled for electricity connections.” One fountain which is currently being repaired is the Flamingo fountain at Masab Tank. Theft of parts have also hit a few fountains and authorities, having spent lakhs on installing them, now don’t want to spend a few thousands every month on a guard. “In some places important components such as pipes, nozzles and other materials have been stolen. We cannot waste public money by deploying a guard for every fountain. Only fountains which are optimal and can be maintained with minimal expenditure are being repaired,” said Srinivas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/fountains-dried-rusted-city-beauty-plan-goes-bust/articleshow/86517131.cms||Moulika.KV
---||Agra||UP: Firozabad fever toll 175, of which 112 are kids; officials confirm only 63||FIROZABAD: The fever toll in Firozabad district continues to go up, with local sources saying 175 have died so far, of whom 112 were children. The CMO, however, has confirmed only 63 deaths. With hospitals reserving all their resources for patients in critical condition, over 25,000 people are now bed-ridden at home, according to official estimates. “Over 100 teams of health staffers have been asked to go door-to-door to identify patients and provide them with medicines and assistance,” CMO Dinesh Kumar Premi said. “There is no shortage of platelets or medicines at government centres. Additional ambulances have been arranged to take patients to hospitals. All recent deaths of patients who had viral fever are being investigated. Health department officials said over 4,000 cases of dengue have been confirmed in Firozabad so far. A few cases of malaria, scrub typhus and leptospirosis have also been reported. When TOI visited Firozabad villages on Saturday, the prevalence of quacks was striking. It was the same scene playing out across Gadhi Tiwari, Sofipur and Nurpur villages — cots under trees where quacks were “treating” fever patients. “Government hospitals are not admitting patients. Over 400 villages are suffering. We depend on quacks, there is no other option,” said Ranveer Singh, a farmer from Nurpur. The report of an investigation by one of the health teams the state government had sent to Firozabad had said that “initial treatment by quacks operating in slums and rural areas was a major reason” for the increasing number of deaths. “Patients were administered steroids. This provided initial relief, but multiplied the rate of falling platelets. Throwing up blood became common in such cases,” the report added. “Quacks have been a huge issue in Firozabad,” said additional director (health) AK Singh. “The initial treatment they provide is pushing patients to critical state when they finally get to a government hospital.” In other villages, like Nagla Amaan, Nagla Mavasi and Okhra, lines of houses stood locked, families having fled in fear and for treatment. “Ten families have left the village. It is the same in villages nearby. Almost every family in the village has a member suffering from a dengue-like fever but proper treatment facilities do not exist,” said Anshu Yadav, who runs a grocery shop at Nagla Amaan. The government health centre at the village has been shut for months. “I sent away my two kids to their aunt in Aligarh. Others have done the same. The only children in the village now are the ones who have come back from hospital,” said Virendra Singh, a farmer from Nagla Mavasi. “Everyone is scared.” While Firozabad has been the epicentre, the viral fever has also claimed lives in Agra, Aligarh, Mathura, Hathras, Bareilly and a few districts of eastern UP over the past month. As of Saturday, 16 people had died after high fever in Agra, of whom 15 were children, Agra CMO Arun Kumar Srivastav said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/firozabad-fever-toll-175-of-which-112-are-kids-officials-confirm-only-63/articleshow/86515367.cms||---

It’s learnt that the victim had come to stay with her grandmother when she was targeted by her maternal uncle who had molested her. The grandmother had threatened the minor against revealing the matter. She had also approached the cops stating the minor must be taken back to Gujarat from where she had come.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: DGP Sanjay Pandey recommends suspension of Param Bir Singh & 24 other cops||MUMBAI: The director general of state police, Sanjay Pandey, has submitted a proposal to the state government for the suspension of 25 police personnel, including former city police commissioner Param Bir Singh, because of the multiple offences registered against them. Sources said that the proposal was submitted around two months ago and is pending before the state home department. Pandey declined to comment. The proposal asks for the suspension of around 25 policemen who were named in FIRs registered against the former police commissioner on extortion charges. So far, five FIRs have been registered against Singh and others. Besides Singh, the proposal seeks the suspension of a DG rank officer, four officials of the rank of deputy commissioners of police and several of the rank of assistant commissioners of police. The FIRs have been registered at Akola, Kopri, Thane, Marine Drive and Goregaon. The former top cop, who had accused the former home minister Anil Deshmukh of corruption, also faces two inquiries by the Anti-Corruption Bureau. The first inquiry is based on the corruption charges against Singh levelled by police inspector Anup Dange. The second inquiry is based on the complaint of inspector Bhimrao Ghadge. He had alleged that when he was probing a cheating case against KDMC officials, Singh who was then Thane police commissioner had misused his official position and issued a closure report despite strong documentary evidence. Besides this, a commission of inquiry headed by Justice K U Chandiwal has also issued a bailable warrant against Singh after he refused to appear before the panel. The bailable warrant was returned unserved as he was not found at any of his known addresses in Malabar Hill and Chandigarh. The commission is probing charges levelled by Singh against the ex-home minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-dgp-recommends-suspension-of-param-bir-24-other-cops/articleshow/86519266.cms||---

The number of daily Covid cases in the district has dropped to double digits, and the number of active cases to triple digits. Moreover, there are low chances of a sudden spike in the Covid numbers. As a result, district collector Rahul Rekhawar has ordered the hospital administration to reserve 50% of beds for non-Covid patients. The hospital has a capacity of 420 beds and currently has only 40 Covid patients. Anita Saibannavar, the dean of the hospital, said: “The outpatient departments, except the orthopaedics, will be opened from Monday. The orthopaedics department has low staff strength right now. Though the orthopaedics department will remain shut, the accident ward will function.” Many patients seek medical treatment at the CPR hospital. Though the treatment available here is of high quality, it is relatively inexpensive. Now, the ICUs will also be made available for general surgeries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/cpr-to-reopen-for-non-covid-cases/articleshow/86513597.cms||---

According to the Telangana State Development Planning Society figures up to 11 pm, Manikonda recorded the highest rainfall of 108 mm followed by 88 mm at Shaikpet and 84.8 mm at Goutham Nagar. Many other areas such as Asmanghad, Malakpet, Khajaguda, Gachibowli, Tolichowki, Nacharam etc. recorded up to 70 mm of rain in a matter of a few hours. The weather activity led to massive waterlogging in Manikonda, Old City areas, Attapur, Rajendra Nagar among other areas. Traffic snarls were reported on many arterial roads. In Tolichowki, people were seen walking in almost knee-deep water as they struggled to move around. At many places, the manholes were seen spilling excess water on the roads. Meteorologists attributed the thunderstorm activity to a deep depression over northeast and adjoining east central Bay of Bengal. “It is likely to intensify into a cyclonic storm during next 12 hours. It is likely to move nearly westwards and cross north Andhra Pradesh – south Odisha coasts between Visakhapatnam and Gopalpur around Kalingapatnam by evening of September 26,” read a weather report by the India Meteorological Department. The IMD, Hyderabad predicts that under the influence of two weather systems on the Bay of Bengal, many parts of Telangana, including Hyderabad would witness heavy rains till September 28. Withdrawal of monsoon is only expected by the first week of October.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/heavy-rains-lash-city-100-mm-rainfall-recorded-in-span-of-2-hrs/articleshow/86517172.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Internet, smartphones key to improving learning rate in Rajasthan||JAIPUR: Literacy rate in the state can match the national average in a decade provided an integrated approach by the state and civil society is introduced, say experts while reacting on poor literacy rate, highest gender divide despite strong foundation laid by erstwhile princely states. Unicef policy planner KB Kothari said grey areas in terms of poor literacy are well defined in the state and the need is to have a tailor-made approach. “Free education added with rewards like scooters and cash benefits have delivered results, but there’s still a go a long way. The state needs to have region/areas/community-specific programmes promoting literacy, especially for women,” said Kothari. TimesViewPoor literacy rate in Rajasthan even after a strong foundation by princely states proves the failure of consecutive governments. Every second woman being illiterate is totally unacceptable. Though the state has identified factors preventing the spread of literacy programmes, a strong political will is needed to reach out to communities lagging in education levels. Mobilising civil society to motivate each other to spread literacy is also needed.He recalled writing a detailed letter to chief minister Ashok Gehlot in 2012 pointing out how rewards policies are not reaching out to the most vulnerable communities in the state. “Females in the reproductive age group of 15-35 years should be targeted with multifold literacy programmes including components of basic English and maths along with financial, legal and skill know-how to suit the needs of the present scenario,” Kothari mentioned in his letter, which he feels are still relevant. Stressing on the need of engaging the civil society, Mohammad Shahzad, state head at Pratham NGO, said without creating a force of volunteers and community leaders, literacy gap can never be achieved. “The team of volunteers has to restart the Shaksharta Mission by heading door-to-door and mobilising community leaders with proper orientation of societal and financial benefits of literacy and education,” said Shahzad, who feels that the state has to reorient its programmes by moving out of format set up like schools to increase literacy rates.  Pointed out that literacy programmes in this era is incomplete with adding an element of digital literacy, Puneet Sharma, an education expert said, “The modules on how to use computers, internet and smartphones are very important to enhance the one’s ability to communicate in the digital medium. The National Education Policy clears emphasis on the digital literacy as one of the tools to narrow the divide between the urban and the rural areas,” said Sharma. “The Congress government has been making sincere efforts to improve the literacy rate of women and also their ratio in schools and colleges. Besides rewards, our government has decided to convert schools with 500 girl students into colleges so that they remain on the same campus and compete in their education. We are committed to bringing male and female students on par with literacy rates,” said Govind Singh Dotasra, state education minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/internet-smartphones-key-to-improving-learning-rate/articleshow/86519252.cms||Shoeb Khan

Check any online hotel booking site, and one sees huge discounts for starred hotels. While the majority of five-star hotels in the district have reduced room rent that was between Rs 6,500 and Rs 10,000 to Rs 3,500-5,500 range. Even four-star and three-star hotels are offering huge discounts, forcing smaller hotels to offer similar discounts or more. “The discounts work on demand and supply. Some offer very good discounts for last-minute booking if the rooms are vacant,” said Johny Abraham, a member of state tourism advisory board. With Kerala continuing to report almost 70% of new Covid cases in the country and with TPR above 15% on most days, domestic travel to God’s Own Country is yet to pick up. But availing the benefits of this offers are people within the state, who are opting for one or two-night stay in these resorts with family. “With people from Kerala opting for destinations within the state, we are now seeing almost 100% occupancy on most weekends. Most of our guests are from north Kerala, who come to the resort to relax. But the situation will change and we will attract more domestic tourists as we all will ultimately learn to live with Covid,” said Ramada Resort general manager Suresh Kumar. With weekend stay gaining popularity with local people, now hotels are limiting the 50-60% discount on room rent to weekdays. On weekends, they are offering only 20 to 25% discount on actual room rent. Besides international tourists, Kerala tourism used to attract many north Indians to the state, who came for either leisure or business meetings, especially during Diwali time. With Diwali in November, hoteliers and tour operators are hopeful that domestic tourist arrival will increase by October-end. Most of the hotels have also renovated their property. However, many admit that things will remain uncertain as Kerala continues to report high Covid numbers. The hotel industry had faced a major setback after the floods of 2018 in Kerala, when the number of tourists – domestic and international – arriving in the state dwindled. In 2019, business had started picking up again and then came Covid that led to a complete shutdown of travel and tourism industry for more than one-and-a-half years. “Tourism industry is on a revival path with tourists from Kerala now. Tourist destinations are doing well, especially on weekends. We have several inquiries from tourists from other states. Once travel restrictions between states are lifted and quarantine rules are eased, things will improve,” said E M Najeeb, president of Confederation of Kerala tourism industry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hotels-resorts-slash-rates-to-woo-guests/articleshow/86515406.cms||Preetu Nair

The event is supported by The Times of India. The interaction with Joshi took place at Mimosa Hall, Chitnavis Centre, on Saturday. It was moderated by LAD College’s English department head and film scholar Ruta Dharmadhikari. VLF chairperson Hemant Lodha and secretary Sachin Jahagirdar were present. Speaking about film journalism, Joshi said, “We end up identifying cinema journalism as film criticism. Cinema needs to be covered in a more holistic way, just like people cover politics, business, health, etc. It’s not just about watching a film for entertainment or because it’s aesthetically and artistically pleasing, but it tells you a lot about society and the context from which it is emerging.” Joshi has served on the critics’ jury of FIPRESCI, the international federation of film critics based in Munich, at several film festivals throughout the world. Describing the experience of being a jury member, Joshi said, “What it involves primarily is to meet fellow critics from the world over, see how people view films differently, how your views are taken and then try and see if you can get into a consensus in order to pick a great film.” Joshi has so far been on the jury in Trivandrum, Moscow, Cairo, Cluj, Toronto and Aurangabad. ‘Reel India: Cinema off the beaten track’, authored by Joshi, chronicles the passion for cinema that runs in every nook and corner of the country. Replying to Dharmadhikari’s question on the kind of cinema a small town India produces, Joshi said, “We have exhausted stories in Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai and Kolkata. The real and transformative India is in these small towns. I see so much passion and dynamism in spaces which have not come to the eye. As journalists, we need to dive deeper.” Highlighting the impact of Covid on film viewing, Joshi said, “In the aftermath of the pandemic, there is a whole new journey that needs to be undertaken because the world has changed dramatically. I have always been a big screen person but in the last one and a half years I have become attuned to streaming platforms. The consumption of cinema has changed drastically.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/bollywood-needs-to-wake-up-and-smell-the-coffee-namrata-joshi/articleshow/86515423.cms||---

The reply came in response to Malpura BJP MLA Kanhaiya Lal Choudhary who had claimed in the assembly that 600 Hindu families fled from the town as part of a ‘land jihad’ conspiracy. The police report stated that since January 1, 2021, the registrar office in Malpura registered sale deeds of 42 properties. Of these, 22 were sold by Muslims to Hindus and 20 were sold vice-versa. “The claims made by MLA Malpura were taken seriously by the police department and a massive investigation was launched by probing every land deal that took place in the past three years. The information corroborated from the registry office, local police officers, buyers, sellers, independent sources etc. clearly pointed out that no forced migration ever took place,” said Om Prakash, SP Tonk. Further sharing the details, Prakash said, “Interestingly, most of the buyers and sellers are still living in Malpura. The reason for purchase and selling turned out to be purely due to business interests and better deals,” said Prakash, who has forwarded the information to the departments concerned. A three-member BJP panel of Sikar MP Sumedhanand Saraswati, Sojat City MLA Shobha Chauhan and Banwari Lal Singhal, former MLA from Alwar, had submitted a report of ‘land jihad’ to BJP state president Satish Poonia. The panel also approached governor Kalraj Mishra demanding strict action against perpetrators of the conspiracy. Also, Tonk-Sawai Madhopur MP Sukhbir Singh Jaunapuria visited Malpura to probe allegations of selling of a house owned by a Hindu family to a Muslim family under pressure from the latter. Chauhan refused to comment on the report. TOI repeatedly called, texted Saraswati and Choudhary for comments but they did not respond.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/no-report-of-land-jihad-received-says-tonk-police-report/articleshow/86519273.cms||---

The exhibition will be on till September 30. “We are planning to resume various programmes as part of Art Space Kochi, an initiative for promoting artists and cultural events,” said Rajan Chidambath, chairman of Centre for Heritage, Environment and Development (C-Hed), a wing of Kochi corporation. More programmes will be organized in a phased manner, the corporation authorities said. The corporation had plans to arrange space in streets for artists to conduct exhibitions of sculptures and installations. There were also plans to close some of the roads during off-peak hours or night and open them for artists to perform. Now, the plan is to start all such programmes in a phased manner. Meanwhile, mayor M Anil Kumar met minister for cultural affairs Saji Cherian and requested the government to open up more sectors . “Those who train students in various art forms are in misery. They are finding it difficult to continue with online classes. Similarly, cinema theatres remain closed for several months. I have requested the minister to take a proactive step in this regard. The minister has promised that the government will take a positive decision after weighing all aspects, including the consequences stemming out of opening more sectors,” Kumar said. “Similarly, people want Subhash Bose Park to be opened. We have also made a request regarding that,” the mayor said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/corp-plans-to-organize-more-cultural-events/articleshow/86515435.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

There is also an increase in solo tourists too. However, unlike the earlier popular destinations like Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh, now people prefer either Ladakh or Kashmir. Also, Gulf countries and South East Asian countries don’t figure in the list. Young couples who want to go on a honeymoon are also looking at travelling to Switzerland, France and Spain either in October or November. “Malayalis are now traveling within India. They prefer hill stations and places where Covid numbers are few. But most of the states are putting restrictions on people travelling from Kerala and due to this, outbound tourism is also to pick up in the state,” said Johny Abraham, a member of state tourism advisory board. However, people who go on a holiday don’t prefer extensive travel. People are travelling because they want a break from the routine and mundane. Once in the destination, they only visit a few places and then prefer to spend most of the time in the hotel, said a tour operator. “The travel pattern has changed due to Covid pandemic. Youngsters are now travelling but senior citizens are not too keen to travel even now. Even families are not interested to travel with children,” said Praveen Shetty from New Prime India Cochin Tours and Travels. Though the number of Malayalis travelling to popular destinations from Kochi is nowhere close to what it was during the pre-Covid times, tour operators said that at least there is a steady movement now and that’s a good enough indication of a better future for the one of the worst-hit industry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/couples-all-set-for-dream-getaways/articleshow/86515427.cms||---

As per the minutes of the meeting, the panchayat president and other members have demanded authorities to provide employment to those who lose their livelihood due to the project and rehabilitate them. The order gives permission to continue with procedures to acquire 220 hectares of land under the Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act 2013. Initially, the project had witnessed strong objection from residents, a majority of them farmers. “There is open land near the current project site. They could have used it for the project and exempt the houses from being evicted. They could also have exempted the farmlands. But the authorities are adamant to acquire the land. We have not seen the EIA report,” said Jose Chullikkaran, convener of the protest committee against the project. Now, discussion is going on to exempt 30 houses, which are situated in the project site. Earlier, around 200 houses were identified to be evicted from the site. The social impact assessment report (SIA), prepared by Rajagiri OutReach also favoured the project. The report inadvertently admits that there is heavy tree cover in the proposed project site. It called for protection of the environment and perpetuate trees in the affected area in lieu of the destroyed trees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/go-asks-collector-to-go-ahead-with-acquisition/articleshow/86515451.cms||T C Sreemol

The state home department used it when it wrote a letter to the director general of police (DGP) last week. For the first time, ‘Love Jihad’ was mentioned as a type of offence when the state home department’s additional secretary (law & order), Nikhil Bhatt, sent the letter to DGP Ashish Bhatia on September 17. Bhatt told Bhatia to convey to senior police officials to bring to the government’s notice important events and serious offences before they are flashed in electronic and social media. Bhatt’s letter reads: “I am to state that number of important and serious incidents/offences took place in the state such as disturbance of law and order…”. The letter then mentions other offences: “…communal riots/incidents, clashes between groups, prohibition/gambling/narcotics related SMC raids, terrorist activities, major economic offences…”. The letter also cites “…political incidents, crimes regarding land grabbing, offences related to love jihad, GujCTOC, man-made or natural calamities, including major road accidents.” The letter says these cases “are reported very late after they flash in the electronic media/ social media.” The home department has appointed additional DGP (law & order), Narsimha Komar, as the nodal officer to whose notice the senior cops must now bring significant developments at the earliest for a prompt response. By amending the Gujarat Freedom of Religion Act in June, the state government made conversion by interfaith marriage a cognizable offence. The amendment has been stayed by the Gujarat high court following a challenge to its constitutional validity. The use of ‘Love Jihad’ as an offence has invited strong objection from certain circles. The convenor of the Minority Coordination Committee, Gujarat, Mujahid Nafees, wrote to the additional secretary saying that the phrase has been misused. “The word ‘Jihad’ is a sacred term in Islam, which bears the meaning of struggle,” Nafees wrote. “Had you inquired with any scholar of Urdu or Arabic, you would have come to know about its importance. This word is never used in Islam for any wrongdoing.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/love-jihad-creeps-into-govt-letter/articleshow/86517345.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Where are funds meant for tribals, asks BJP MLA||Yavatmal: ‘Khawati for Tribals’ is a welfare scheme introduced by the Central government which aims to provide essential commodities to tribals and thereby ensure a dignified life for them. Accordingly, the government of Maharashtra had started its implementation which was later put on hold due to lack of funds. However, the MVA government headed by Uddhav Thackeray ordered its relaunch in the first phase of the Covid pandemic. The government allotted funds for the scheme in which each beneficiary would get Rs 4,000 in the form of 12 essential commodities through PDS shops. Nearly 11.55 lakh tribals from various categories were identified for the benefit of the scheme by surveys. A sum of Rs 486 crore was also sanctioned. However, items supplied through public distribution shops were found to be of sub-standard quality. Since the articles supplied through the PDS couldn’t supply all the essential commodities, the beneficiaries had to buy them from the open market. The government decided to increase the aid after the matter was brought to its notice. Thackeray raised it from Rs 4,000 to Rs 6,000 during the second phase of the pandemic. The additional amount of Rs 2,000 would be directly credited to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries so that they could meet the additional expense on other essential commodities. However, there is no remittance of this Rs.2000 to the accounts, it is alleged. “Where did this money go?,” asks sitting BJP MLA from Arni-Kelapur tribal assembly constituency Dr Sandeep Dhurve after meeting governor Kosiyari in Mumbai recently. According to Dhurve, he presented samples of commodities supplied to tribals before the governor and submitted a memorandum of demands which include a thorough high level probe into the multi crore scam being carried out in the name of the poor, innocent and illiterate tribal communities. Why such inhuman action is allowed ? Dhurve wanted to know. Dhurve further said that crores of rupees have been pocketted by the bureaucrats and politically supported groups in the name of tribal welfare schemes. “I strongly demand a probe to expose the scam and bring the corrupt officers and politicians to justice,” Dhurve said, adding, food material supplied to poor tribals should be sent to the national lab to ascertain the quality and quantity of the same. “I have also written to the chief minister and urged him to credit the additional sum of Rs 2,000 to the beneficiaries’ bank accounts immediately. According to Dhurve, the governor has also forwarded his representation to the chief minister, urging the latter to inquire into the matter. “In case if my representation is not considered by the chief minister, I shall, alongwith other tribal MLAs, launch an indefinite hunger strike in front of the state assembly during the forthcoming winter session to be held in Nagpur,” an agitated Dhurve said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/where-are-funds-meant-for-tribals-asks-bjp-mla/articleshow/86515453.cms||---

The incident took place between 3 am and 4 am on Saturday in Chembur. The police have arrested the accused, Dhiraj Singh, who does odd jobs. He will be produced before a court on Sunday. A police officer said that the survivor, along with a friend, had gone to Marine Drive for a stroll on Friday night. She along with him returned to her residence around 3am. “The accused, who stays in the same area and is known to the victim, was standing in a lane. He was holding an iron rod, and he threatened the woman and her friend. Panicking, the woman’s friend fled from the scene. The accused, while threatening the woman with an iron rod, took her to another lane and raped her,” said the police. After the incident, the accused fled from the crime scene. The woman, who does odd jobs, approached the Chembur police and lodged a complaint. Two special teams were formed to nab Singh. “We arrested the accused and will produce him before the court on Sunday,” said an officer. Jaikumar Suryavanshi, senior inspector of Chembur police station, said, “The victim was sent for medical examination. Our probe is on.” Police teams are also scanning CCTV cameras of the area. Manisha Shirke, a woman police inspector, is investigating the case. It is learnt that the accused is married and stays with his wife. Investigators are also checking if there was any previous crime registered against the accused. The accused was reportedly drunk. He was sent for medical examination and his blood report was awaited. The accused has been booked under Section 376 (punishment for rape), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code.

---||Nagpur||Club works, issue tenders as per norms to avoid loss: Civic chief orders engrs||Nagpur: The engineers of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) allegedly in nexus with few corporators have split works worth around Rs35 crore to keep their value below Rs3 lakh to avoid the tendering process. Taking cognisance of the alleged violation and financial loss being caused to the cash-strapped civic body, municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B has made it mandatory for the engineers to club works and execute them only through tendering process. Following the orders, NMC chief engineer and chief accounts and finance officer have issued a circular warning of action against the engineers if they don’t not comply. “It is learnt that the engineers are not issuing tenders to execute similar type of works and those under one head together. Instead, they are being done in parts by inviting quotations, thus causing financial loss to the NMC,” the circular said. The circular added that the NMC will get competitive bids in case similar types of works are done through tendering process. “Besides preventing financial loss, it will help in completing works within defined time period. The officials should comply with the orders and submit an action taken report once in a week with the superintending engineer,” the circular stated. NMC sources said the ruling party has organized a special meeting of the general body on September 27 to target the civic chief and higher officials regarding the circular. It is likely that resolution will be passed directing the civic chief to set aside the circular. TOI had many a time exposed the nexus between the engineers and a few corporators in splitting similar type of works to avoid tendering process. TOI had even reported about how the same was done with funds of past three mayors. As per NMC’s norms, tender is mandatory for executing works above Rs3 lakh. For works costing below Rs3 lakh, quotations are invited. Apart from nature of work and area, private contractor is also same in many works. NMC officials told TOI that engineers have proposed works around Rs35 crore under various heads — ward fund, zonal fund, backward class fund, garden, PWD, public health engineering department — through quotations below Rs3 lakh. Majority of the works are worth above Rs2.70 lakh — between Rs2.90 lakh and Rs 3 lakh. Sources said currently, private contractors are bagging big works quoting below 25%, so tendering process will benefit the NMC. “It also becomes difficult to monitor small works,” said sources. The Nandlal Committee too had directed avoiding splitting of similar type of works. Standing committee chairman Prakash Bhoyar and leader of opposition Tanaji Wanve said the circular was against the NMC’s norms. They said corporators get Rs20 lakh ward fund per annum. “People approach for small problems like chokage of sewage lines, waterlogging, demand sitting chairs, interlocking tiles etc. Therefore, corporators propose small works in phased manner and in different areas,” they said. They claimed that there is no nexus between corporators and engineers and no loss to the NMC in works executed through quotation. “It is going on for last many years,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/club-works-issue-tenders-as-per-norms-to-avoid-loss-civic-chief-orders-engrs/articleshow/86517266.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

---||Thane||Thane police commissioner orders inquiry: Why cops ‘turned away’ Dombivli gang rape survivor’s mother?||KALYAN: The day after Dombivli gang rape survivor was discharged from hospital following a 72-hour stay, the special investigation team (SIT) probing the case seized an autorickshaw used multiple times in the crime and Thane police commissioner Jai Jeet Singh ordered an inquiry over the alleged apathy shown by the local Manpada police station where the minor’s mother had wanted to file a missing person complaint in May. TOI had reported on Friday on May 5, some of the accused had forced the minor to stay out all night. The girl’s mother had approached the police but they had allegedly turned her away and asked her to return with the minor’s photo. By the time the mother had reached home, the girl had returned. Singh confirmed to TOI an inquiry has been ordered. This autorickshaw was “used multiple times” in the gang rape caseThe survivor who was undergoing treatment at staterun Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Hospital in Kalwa was discharged on Friday evening. Dr B S Jadhav, hospital dean, said, “We conducted all medical tests required for the investigation, including for forensic records.” The SIT seized the autorickshaw, which belonged to one of the accused. It was used for the first time on January 29 when a friend of the survivor had taken her to his friend’s place where the duo had laced a juice with sedatives and raped her and recorded a video on a mobile phone which was later used to blackmail her. The police said the seized autorickshaw was used for the second time by the accused on March 22 to take her to another place. The police had seized the mobile phones of all the accused which were sent to the forensic laboratory for data recovery as the video and the social media accounts of the accused had been deleted. Police have provided security at the minor’s residence, since most of the accused are from the same locality. So far, the SIT has arrested 29 accused, including two minors, and has launched a hunt for four remaining persons. On Saturday, BJP workers with Kalyan city president Sanjay More held a protest. MNS too held a protest march. Meanwhile, lawyer Trupti Patil said she will appear on behalf of 19 of the 29 accused.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Second Covid wave showed value of indigenous ventilators, says professor||AHMEDABAD: The second wave of Covid-19 underlined the need of oxygen for patients with severe infections and the importance of ventilators. While the pandemic motivated many India-based manufacturers to support the fight with indigenously-developed ventilators, the number remained small. One such sity attempt was from Pandit Deendayal Energy Univer-(PDEU) where Prof S Sundar Manoharan, the director general of PDEU, led efforts to develop a ventilator from scratch. The end result was the EGL-101 ventilator, which was developed along with Chennai-based Eagle Group. “If we look closely, a ventilator requires amalgamation of different disciplines of engineering. To maintain pressure and air volume, we need physics. To handle the equipment, we need algorithm for a quick response in choosing the right mode of activation where computer engineering comes to play. For the motherboard and air mixer, we need E&C and mechanical engineering respectively. All of this is topped by the need for a user-friendly functional design,” said Prof Manoharan. He said the trapezoidal rule helps monitor a patient’s condition in wave form, based on which various modes are selected automatically or manually. “During the second wave, about 800 patients benefited from the 50-odd such ventilators used across Indian hospitals,” he added. The project started as an engineering challenge. “During the Covid period, PDEU worked on multiple projects – from antiviral fabric to image processing techniques. But the core idea was, what can we contribute as an engineering institute? The experience of the second wave prompted us to further fine-tune the machine,” said the university DG. The ventilator has a pediatric mode, assistive control mode, BiPAP and CPAP pressure support with noninvasive and inverse ratio ventilation and high-flow oxygen therapy, said the designers, adding that only a few attempts at university level for ventilators were seen in India, including one at IIT Kanpur. “The purpose of the project is both a demonstration of capability and to boost the Make in India initiative,” said Prof Manoharan. “The second wave taught us the importance of indigenously-developed ventilators.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/second-wave-showed-value-of-indigenous-ventilators/articleshow/86517340.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Defunct Sabarmati riverfront lifts let down persons with disabilities||AHMEDABAD: The Sabarmati riverfront, the jewel of Ahmedabad’s development, has no space for those with disabilities or senior citizens. There are nine elevators on both sides of the riverfront but only one is functional, with the remaining eight dysfunctional or locked. Sabarmati Riverfront Development Corporation Ltd (SRFDCL) has installed these elevators for disabled people and senior citizens to get from the upper promenade to the lower one. Visitors with physical disabilities are thus forced to either remain on the upper promenade or struggle down the stairs to the lower promenade. Out-of-order elevators Naran Barot, a polio-affected resident of Ranip, visits Sabarmati riverfront often. “I am a member of a group of disabled people. We often meet at the riverfront. Every time we try to access the lifts they are either locked or not working,” Barot said. He added that climbing down the stairs is also very difficult for him. Raghu Rabari, a resident of Chandkheda, who lost a leg in an accident, says, “The riverfront is one place where I can get some peace of mind without spending money. I cannot reach the lower level as the lifts are never working or are locked.” Many senior citizens face the same problem. An SRFDCL official said the lift maintenance is not done by SRFDCL but has been contracted out. “We will look into the matter,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/defunct-riverfront-lifts-let-down-persons-with-disabilities/articleshow/86517330.cms||---

---||Coimbatore||92,926 people booked in city for jumping stop signal in 8 months||Coimbatore: The city traffic police have registered 92,926 cases against people for jumping the red signal at traffic junctions in the past eight months, compared to 90,145 in the same period last year.  S R Senthilkumar, city deputy traffic commissioner of police, said most of the motorists were not stopping their vehicles after seeing the red light at traffic signals. “We noticed a group of food delivery boys violating the rule and the traffic police officers are directed to conduct a special awareness programme for them.” The city traffic police have registered 9.14 lakh cases of traffic rule violations in total and imposed a fine of Rs Rs 2.11 crore in the first eight months of the year. “We have automatic number plate recognition cameras and internet protocol cameras at various junctions on Avinashi Road, Trichy Road and Mettupalayam Road. They can capture two important violations - red light jumping at signals and not wearing helmets while riding motorbikes. Our officers on field are currently focusing on such violators,” Senthilkumar said. The city police collect a fine of Rs Rs 100 for jumping the signal. If the amendment to the Motor Vehicles Act were to be implemented in the district, the fine amount will increase to Rs Rs 1000, said a traffic police officer, who didn’t want to be named. He said they had registered 9,14,545 traffic violation cases during the period and penalized the offenders to the tune of Rs 2,22,86,190. Last year, only 8,96,739 traffic violation cases were registered during the same period, when the offenders were fined Rs 3.78 crore. “We are also focusing on no-parking offences. We have installed no-parking sign boards on various stretches across the city. However, many motorists do not care them and park vehicles there. We have booked more than 1.14 lakh cases for violating the no-parking rule alone,” Senthilkumar told TOI. It is to be noted that vehicle movements were restricted on roads last year because of the pandemic situation. Hence, fatal accidents were also less in number. While the city has recorded 57 fatal accidents in which 59 people lost their lives till August 31 this year, only 39 such accidents were reported in the same period last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/92926-people-booked-in-city-for-jumping-stop-signal-in-8-months/articleshow/86517299.cms||A Subburaj
---||Delhi||Second coming of Chandni Chowk: But traders unhappy, say choke’s on us||NEW DELHI: Chandni Chowk was an abyss. All romantic tales about the historic area were just a mirage, at least in modern times. Anyone who visited the much-talked-about shopping esplanade dealt with deafening traffic noise, unbearable pollution, unending crowds, roads in bad shape and dangerous power lines overhead. This was a locality on the verge of collapse. It needed immediate attention. That is exactly what it got. Cut to the present day. The stretch from Shri Digambar Jain Lal Mandir till Fatehpuri Masjid is a sandstone-paved pedestrian way on which motorised vehicles aren’t permitted between 9am and 9pm. The central section of the avenue has benches and greenery demarcations, small pillars line the street on either side, no livewires hang over the head, neither is there traffic congestion. New signboards identify the kuchas and galis, the lanes, and make navigation easy. Prominent landmarks on the 1.3-km stretch, including Gurdwara Sisganj Sahib, Central Baptist Church and Town Hall, now are unobstructed from view and the hole-inthe-wall eateries have emerged from their anonymity forced on them by the earlier crowding. Years of neglect and unplanned growth had made these inaccessible, as also everything else that the original retail hub of Shahjahanabad had to offer — from a cycle market on Esplanade Road, an electronics hub at Lajpat Rai Market and Bhagirath Palace, apparel retail stores at the katras, jewellery at Dariba to footwear and spectacles at Ballimaran. What one would have ideally loved to see are the adjoining areas getting a facelift at par with the main boulevard. The entrance to Chandni Chowk is still congested, while Nai Sadak, Dariba and Ballimaran are still their dilapidated selves. Paranthe Wali Gali and the katras are pictures of neglect and crumbling infrastructure. Katra Neel has three unique temples but they still lie hidden behind the apparel stores, while Fatehpuri Masjid is as good as forgotten in this redevelopment exercise. The few toilets are far from each other and TOI saw no emergency vehicle in sight should a medical emergency arise. Rickshaw pullers too are not regulated and as a result, there’s a crowd at the intersections. Despite these shortcomings, the redevelopment that took over two years is well worth it. The historic street may still be a far cry from its original glory, but now it offers a novel experience even for those who have walked its length numerous times before. ...But traders unhappy, say choke's on usWhile heritage lovers, shoppers and leisure visitors are excited about the revamp of Chandni Chowk, many shopkeepers and locals are not particularly enthused by the result. The common plaint among them is that the esplanade’s makeover is focused on casual visitors and not on the concerns of local residents and businesses A bridal wear seller blamed the barring of cars from the area for the big dip in customers. He said only shops on the main boulevard will benefit while the katras continue to wallow in urban neglect. "Parking is a major issue and it hasn’t been addressed," he elaborated. "It takes an hour for a shopkeeper to park his vehicle and reach the shop and it is relayed in reverse in the evening. Shops now have to rely on porters to ferry heavy loads when shops have to replenish their stocks." Another shop owner said the idea of redevelopment was to decongest the locality but it has ended up choking the area with hawkers and rickshaws. He also pointed out that cleanliness took a hit just a week of the reopening. The pedestrianism, he felt, might charm young people out to shop, soak in old-world tradition and enjoy street food, but it didn’t do any good for the elders and serious retail shoppers. Jasmeet Singh of AB Pal Electricals, a prominent store in Bhagirath Market, said the beautification drive shouldn’t have terminated with the main boulevard but should have taken into its purview even the adjoining commercial lanes. "While Chandni Chowk looks beautiful and is much cleaner than before, the redevelopment will only benefit shops on either side of the main road," he said. Vishal Mehta of Paramount Electronics at Lajpat Rai Market express concern about the inconvenience now being faced by businesses on the redeveloped stretch. He has heard that ferrying goods is a hassle with motorised transport prohibited during the daytime. Mehta hoped that a parking facility would now come up and the congestion at Chandni Chowk’s entrance is eased. While the shop owners in Nai Sadak and Dariba felt totally ignored, food sellers are a happy lot. A prominent food outlet owner welcomed the ban on entry of vehicles into the esplanade and happily said the area will soon turn into a popular and well-connected leisure hub. He did suggest, however, that security post-9pm needs to be enhanced and the cleanliness maintained to ensure the historic street becomes a draw for tourists.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/second-coming-of-chandni-chowk-but-traders-unhappy-say-chokes-on-us/articleshow/86520326.cms||Amin Ali

---||Nagpur||Now, pay more for safari in MP parks from Oct 1||Nagpur: As wildlife parks are all set to reopen from October 1 after monsoon vacation, tourists visiting tiger reserves in Madhya Pradesh will have to shell out more for safari as fees have been increased. The cost will go up further on premium days (weekends and holidays). On the contrary, there is no change in fee structure in Tadoba, Bor and Maharashtra Pench and parks under it. From October 1, the gate fee in MP parks will increase from the existing Rs1,500 to Rs2,400. On premium days (weekends and holidays), it will be Rs3,000. In Kanha National Park, a safari would cost Rs5,900 on weekdays but on premium days it will cost Rs6,500. As there is no confirmation about safari vehicle hike from the existing Rs2,500 in MP Pench, a safari there will cost Rs500 less than Kanha. “We have decided to increase vehicle fee as there was demand from the Gypsy Association, Kanha, to increase safari cost to Rs3,500 owing to hike in fuel price, insurance and maintenance. We settled for Rs3,000,” said SK Singh, field director, Kanha. There is no change in the entry fee structure for buffer zones but safari vehicles will charge Rs3,000. A safari in Kanha buffer would cost Rs5,000. “The hike in jungle safari in MP will work to the advantage of Tadoba and Pench. If bookings are done within 60 days, a safari costs Rs4,200 in Tadoba core on weekdays, and at weekends it is Rs5,200. Besides, a trip in buffer costs Rs4,000 on all days, which is competitive than MP parks. Given the number of gates and regular tiger sightings, Tadoba always has an edge,” said a resort owner Nikhil Abhyankar. Bookings beyond 60-120 days in Tadoba costs Rs7,200 on weekdays and Rs11,200 on weekends and holidays. “However, those booking safaris from November 16 will have to shell out Rs3,000 for a Gypsy against existing Rs2,700,” said Nandkishore Kale, deputy director (core), TATR. Pench and Bor tiger reserves and Umred-Karhandla-Paoni wildlife sanctuary will reopen for tourists from October 1. In a release, Pench field director Ravikiran Govekar said that from October 1 to 15, entry will be offline from Sillari, Khursapar, Chorbahuli, Kolitmara, Surewani, Khubala, Paoni, Bordharan, Karhandla and Gothangaon gates. Considering the condition of roads, tourism will be allowed in a restricted manner. In Bor, 12 vehicles will be allowed. Adegaon gate will remain closed due to bad road conditions. The Paoni tourism gate of Umred-Karhandla will remain open offline from October 15 to 31. Online bookings for entry from October 16 can be done from October 10 on www.mahaecotourism.gov.in. Govekar said, “As of now, there is no fee hike in safari and entry, but there is a possibility about the hike in near future. In such a situation, tourists doing online bookings will have to pay the difference in amount. Tourism will be done as per the Covid-19 protocols.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/now-pay-more-for-safari-in-mp-parks-from-oct-1/articleshow/86517311.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

He is undergoing treatment in a private hospital, where his condition is said to be stable. A forest officer identified the victim as S Palanisamy, a resident of Sappanimadai near Madvarayapuram. “He had cultivated plantain on his farmland at Boluvampatti. He used to visit the agricultural field at night to chase away wild animals that come to raid his crop.” On Friday night, the officer said, Palanisamy visited the farmland as usual and positioned himself on a treetop hut to monitor the movement of wild animals in the vicinity. “When a tusker entered his agricultural field, he started bursting firecrackers to chase away the animal. On seeing the tusker walking away, he climbed down the tree. However, the tusker returned immediately and attacked him.” Other farmers, meanwhile, rushed to the spot and took Palanisamy to a private hospital with fractured legs. T K Ashok Kumar, district forest officer, said the wild elephant movement was noticed at the villages along Periyanaickenpalayam, Coimbatore, Boluvampatti, Mettupalayam and Sirumugai forest ranges. “Residents of Pattisholai, Kopanari, Varapalayam, Mangarai, 24 Veerapandi, Mullankadu, Viraliyur, Narasipuram, Madvarayapuram, Oomapalayam, Kallar, Odanthurai, Sirumugai and Seenguli areas should not come out of their houses in the early morning and night hours. People are also advised not to travel in these areas on their motorcycles at night,” he said. The officer has also requested them not to try to chase away elephants. “They can alert us at 180042545456 or 0422-2456922 if they notice wild elephant movement in their areas.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/elephant-attacks-farmer-who-tried-to-chase-it-away/articleshow/86517359.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

MahaMetro officials said the TBM was assembled over the past few days and began excavation after running preliminary trials. MahaMetro said that it has not received any reports of damage to above-ground structures during the tunnel work so far — the tunnel is being dug 18 metres underground. Other tunnels on the stretch range from 18 to 25 metres underground. MahaMetro said the tunnelling work in the Civil Court-Swargate section was delicate as the route was aligned through the old city areas, which are home to many ageing buildings. “No damage to any structures has been reported so far. We surveyed all the buildings located along the tunnel alignment and are taking the necessary precautions during excavation,” Hemant Sonawane, general manager (PR), MahaMetro, said. Two parallel tunnels are coming up in the underground stretch between Swargate and the depot at the College of Agriculture in Shivajinagar. The excavation of the first tunnel has progressed beyond Mandai; tunnelling till Kasba Peth is likely to be completed over the next month. Officials said, “Three TBMs have been deployed for the excavation work. Two are excavating from Swargate towards Kasba Peth, while the third has reached the Kasba Peth station site from the Civil Court end. We have expedited the tunnelling work.” MahaMetro plans to extract the machines from the Kasba Peth duct. A detailed plan is being chalked out in this regard, official said. The agency has also initiated other work, such as laying of cables and track-related work, in the sections where the tunnel is ready. A stabling tunnel is also coming up at the Swargate end to enable parking of the rakes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/excavation-of-metros-2nd-tunnel-in-swargate-begins/articleshow/86517352.cms||Sarang Dastane

The Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) had on Friday disconnected the power supply to the units based on a communication in this regard from the TNPCB. The district environmental engineer of TNPCB, P Manimaran, had issued the closure notice on September 23, since the units, which were run by two separate firms, were functioning without obtaining clearance from the department. The residents of Malaipalayam and neighbouring village had taken up the issue with the officials, as the units were threatening their livelihood. “The units used to let out untreated effluent in open channels, contaminating groundwater. They were also drawing lot of water illegally through borewells. It was a cause for concern to us,” a villager said. A Thiyagarajan, a farmer, said the units were set up two years ago without obtaining clearance from the TNPCB. “We had made several representations to various officials during the AIADMK regime, but in vain. We had petitioned DMK chief MK Stalin during his assembly poll campaign. We followed it up after he became the chief minister. Subsequently, TNPCB officials sprang into action.” He said there were many such units functioning in and around the village without obtaining clearance. “All such units should be shut down to stop groundwater pollution.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/tnpcb-closes-down-three-illegal-coir-pith-units/articleshow/86517346.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

According to the new projections, which were circulated on Thursday, the state’s total population is 3.03 crore and the eligible population for Covid vaccination is 2.05 crore, which earlier stood at 1.9 crore. Similarly, Gurgaon’s total projected population is 26.3 lakh, of whom the 18-plus population is 17.89 lakh, which earlier stood at 16.32 lakh. So far, Haryana has administered 1,58,97,523 first doses (77%) and 57,40,514 second doses (28%). Gurgaon till Thursday had administered 19,75,599 lakh first doses, which means its official first dose coverage remains over 100%, and 9,85,406 second doses (55%). Chief medical officer Virender Yadav said the city is likely to administer 26 lakh first doses. The latest revision, which came after the Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India carried out an analysis of data based on Census 2011 and decadal growth rate of each state, has increased the estimated number of recipients by 15 lakh in Haryana, with Gurgaon accounting for the highest increase — more than 1.5 lakh — among 22 districts. “The eligible population has been revised upwards by the health ministry. It has been done for all states,” said Rajeev Arora, ACS (health), Haryana. Gurgaon’s first dose coverage is followed by Panchkula and Ambala (98%), Faridabad (94%), Charkhi Dadri (88%), Rewari (85%) and Bhiwani and Jhajjar (80%). Nuh (27%), Jind (57%), Palwal (61%), Kaithal (68%) and Sirsa (71%) have the lowest coverage. On Friday, 48 session sites — 42 for Covishield, five for Covaxin and one for Sputnik — will be held. A total of 8,568 doses were given on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/haryana-revises-vax-target-adds-15l-recipients/articleshow/86509031.cms||Ipsita Pati

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: New Western Railway station to offer local access to Bandra Terminus||MUMBAI: Long-distance passengers will have easier connectivity to Bandra Terminus via suburban local trains as the Western Railway (WR) has planned a new station close to it on the Harbour line that operates between CSMT and Goregaon. Bandra Terminus falls between Khar Road and Bandra stations on WR’s suburban network. Most longdistance passengers, though, prefer the share-an-autorickshaw service that operates between Bandra station (East) and Bandra Terminus. WR’s chief public relation officer Sumit Thakur said, “Indian Railway Station Development Corporation (IRSDC) has planned redevelopment of Bandra Terminus. During the last meeting with them, it was decided that while freezing the redevelopment plan, provision will be made for access to Bandra Terminus from the proposed suburban station.” Harbour line trains, after crossing Bandra, take an elevated route before descending at the grade level just ahead of Khar station. The elevated Harbour line is used for both up and down traffic. WR has plans to demolish this elevated route to create space to lay the fifth and sixth lines that will operate between Mumbai Central and Borivli. Hence, it was decided to construct a new bridge for Harbour line. Once this new bridge becomes operational, the existing Harbour line bridge will be demolished and the vacated space will be used for laying of the fifth and sixth lines. A WR official said, “While building a new viaduct for the Harbour line, there will be provision for a suburban station which will be easier to access from Bandra Terminus.” Most terminus stations in Mumbai have easy access to the local train network, except Bandra Terminus. IRSDC is also exploring options to improve road connectivity to it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-new-wr-station-to-offer-local-access-to-bandra-terminus/articleshow/86519446.cms||Manthank Mehta

The panel wanted to know if it was regular practice in Telangana to engage a private guest house as safe house to keep the accused during custody and, if long-range weapons , are usually carried by police escorting the accused in rape and murder cases. The commission also asked why a request was made for six long-range weapons to be issued for the escort party, safeguarding the four Disha case accused, and if such a request was normally made in respect of escorting the accused. The DCP said that based on request of ACP Shadngar V Surender, the CP Cyberabad, sanctioned escort party from the armed reserve with long-range weapons and such request has been made to use them as a deterrence till additional force arrives if mob tries to harm the accused during police custody. When the commission asked him why he did not instruct the investigation officer (IO) of the alleged encounter killing case on December 6, 2019 to wait for jurisdictional magistrate before completion of inquest and shifting of bodies, the DCP stated that he had received information that a new IO had been appointed and he did not interfere with investigation. When they asked if he was aware of the minimum statutory requirement of inquest to be done in presence of jurisdictional magistrate, the DCP said, “I plead my ignorance in that aspect.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/panel-grills-dcp-on-use-of-long-range-weapons/articleshow/86517402.cms||Mahesh Buddi

---||Agra||UP: Firozabad rural families borrow beyond means, sell off valuables to get kin treated||FIROZABAD: With government hospitals running out space and private hospitals asking for deposits upfront following the viral fever outbreak, farmers and daily wagers from rural Firozabad — already struggling with limited access to healthcare and a teetering local economy — have been forced to borrow money at exorbitant rates or sell off the few valuables they have to get their family members treated. Shanti Devi, for instance, took her sick husband to a private hospital in Firozabad. The bangle unit worker from Nagla Amaan village was asked for Rs 20,000 before her husband, a bus driver, could be admitted. “I didn’t have the money. I borrowed from a local lender. Now, I have to repay Rs 30,000 in six months. I don’t know how,” she told TOI. Her work has been shut for a month because of the outbreak. Her husband had been too sick to report to work. Subhash Kashyap, a farmer from Khera Langar, had to borrow Rs 50,000 to get his six-year-old daughter admitted. “Private hospitals won’t even admit patients without the deposit,” he said. At Jampur, Nandan Kumar, a labour contractor, sold off his wedding ring for Rs 45,000 to get his 16-year-old son treated. “The hospital had asked for Rs 30,000,” he said. It is the same across villages. “People are scared. They are selling off jewellery and animals to arrange for treatment at private hospitals,” said Kamla Devi at Okhra village. “In our village, eight people have died in a month. Two children died waiting for treatment at Firozabad medical college. What can they do?” Known as the ‘glass city’ of India, Firozabad’s glass industry has been the community’s economic backbone and supports more than six lakh people. After the viral fever outbreak, most of the 400 registered units and 1,500 supply units practically shut down. The workers anyway made just about Rs 200 a day for eight hours of work, TOI had reported. With even that gone, people are in dire straits. “I have not earned one paisa in three weeks. The manufacturing unit shut down and I don’t know when and if it will resume. My five-year-old son has fever and diarrhoea. I had to borrow Rs 2,000 for his medicines and our food,” said Santosh Kumar, 40, from Firozabad. For some, what they can scrape together is eventually not enough. Jugendra Singh has borrowed over Rs 1 lakh for the treatment of 10 of his family members at a private hospital in Agra. He is a farmer from Gadhi Kalyan, unwell himself, with high fever. “The community health centre is not admitting patients with symptoms,” he said. “My daughter Neha, 9, died on September 19 after battling high fever, stomach ache, exhaustion and vomiting for five days,” he added. “Her mother doesn’t know yet. She is too sick herself.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/firozabad-rural-families-borrow-beyond-means-sell-off-valuables-to-get-kin-treated/articleshow/86515563.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||Census to map butterfly hotspots in Aravalis||GURUGRAM: Ten teams of the Haryana forest and wildlife department, equipped with a camera, compass, and recorder will document butterflies for a day in Rewari’s Khol block, in the state’s first-ever census to spot, identify, record and photograph the species in the Aravali region. The September 28 survey will be undertaken in Mangar Bani-like dry, deciduous scrub-forest areas of the Khol block, comprising 10 villages — Palra, Ahhrod, Bassduda, Khol, Manethi, Bhalki, Majra, Nandha, Balwari and Khaleta — which are spread over 1,000 hectares with a contiguous stretch of the Aravalis. “The stretch has a similar vegetation pattern like Mangar Bani, which is unique in itself, first. Similar surveys may be carried out in other parts of the state later,” Sundar, Rewari district forest officer, told TOI on Thursday. Haryana, with mostly a dry climate and dry, deciduous vegetation with few waterbodies spread far and wide, does not have any known indigenous butterfly species, say experts. The first-of-its-kind survey in the state would not just help to monitor the presence of different species and their hotspots, but also indicate the impact of habitat disturbance and climate change on the ecology of the region. “Butterflies are called the flowers on wings. They are not just beautiful but are also important pollinators. There is a symbiotic relationship between plants and butterflies. The presence of butterflies is a sign of a healthy ecosystem. It signifies the presence of rich and diverse life forms,” ML Mallik, the conservator of wildlife south Haryana, said. Butterflies, Mallik added, are very sensitive to habitat disturbance and pollution. The outcome of the survey, experts say, will not only help to chalk out a management strategy for the conservation of butterflies and moths but also form the basis for observing the impact of habitat disturbance and climate change on the ecology of the region. Harvinder Singh of the state tourism department, who will also take participate in the survey, said, “Ten teams, equipped with camera, compass, and recorder, will document butterflies throughout the day.” The winged insects, experts say, are characterised by their four scale-covered wings that are made from scales on a chitin base. These scales are pigmented with melanins, which give butterflies myriad hues and colouration. The survey will be flagged off by Jagdish Chander, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (wildlife).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/census-to-map-butterfly-hotspots-in-aravalis/articleshow/86509015.cms||Ipsita Pati
---||India||Longer 24-week cap for MTP in special cases now in force||MUMBAI: The Union health ministry on Friday issued a notification stating the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Act, 2018, that extends the time limit for abortion from 20 weeks to 24 weeks has “come into force”. However, activists say the law needs “fine-tuning’’. The amendment does not uniformly extend the 24-week deadline to all women. It applies only to rape survivors, minors and pregnancies with fetal abnormalities. “The most commonly cited reason for abortion is contraception failure. The time limit for this remains 20 weeks,” said city gynecologist Nikhil Datar, who began the drive for changing the time limit for MTP. He said he will not quit his case in the SC. Dr Nikhil Datar, the city-based gynecologist who began the movement for changing the time limit of medical termination of pregnancy in 2008, said, “I am not planning to withdraw the case from the Supreme Court as there is still some work left to be done.” Lawyer Anubha Rastogi said, “We were hoping the amendment would be in the form of an acknowledgement of women’s rights, but it has not happened so far.’’ The amended law also is not yet in sync with many other legislations covering the rights of the disabled, mentally ill and transgenders, among others, she said. She further pointed out, “The rules stating whom the new time limit applies to need to be properly defined. Earlier, doctors would use their medicinal background to assess if continuing a pregnancy would adversely affect a woman’s health, but there are no guidelines yet.’’ In the last five years, over 300 cases have been filed by women seeking medical termination beyond the then-permissible limit of 20 weeks. “A system was created by courts to direct such pleas to a medical board. With the new amendment coming into force, we need to set up such linkages again. A guidance note or a framework has to be there,” said Dr Datar. In 2008, Dr Datar first moved Bombay high court and then the SC when his patient, Nikita Mehta, wanted to terminate her 24-week pregnancy after a scan showed cardiac anomalies in the foetus. While Mehta did not get permission to terminate the pregnancy and subsequently lost her baby, Dr Datar continued with his plea to extend the 20-week time limit. His reasoning was simple: Some brain and heart anomalies do not show up in scans until after the 20th week. “We fought the battle and, brick by brick, have managed to get so far, but certain rules need to be laid down with a lot of thought,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/longer-24-week-cap-for-mtp-in-special-cases-now-in-force/articleshow/86521566.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Industries seek a cap on water charges amid pandemic blues||AHMEDABAD: In the semi-arid land of Gujarat, water remains a scarce commodity – be it for domestic, agriculture or industrial use. Even as adequate water availability continues to concern manufacturers, especially in Kutch and Saurashtra regions, industries are seeking to cap water charges which are rising year after year. This demand has come because industrial units are already battling pressures of rising production cost and revenue shortfalls in the post-pandemic period. Gujarat Water Infrastructure Limited (GWIL) has been supplying Narmada water to industries for the past 20 years. With a 10% surge in rates year after year, manufacturing units in Kutch and Saurashtra region currently buy water for industrial use at Rs 50 per kilolitre (KL). This charge has gone up by 233% from Rs 15 per KL in 2015. At a time when other raw material costs have dramatically surged, increased water rates have added to the cost pressure on industries such as textiles, bromine and salt-derivatives where water requirement is pretty high. “Costs incurred to procure water accounts for roughly 12-15% of the production cost in textile, bromine, steel, TMT bar manufacturing units, among others. While rising water charges are impacting our competitiveness, we are not getting enough water. Even though GWIL has signed a contract with industries in Kutch to provide 90 million litre per day (MLD) water, the actual supply is barely 50%,” said an industry source. A representation to cap water charges has been moved to the state government by the Federation of Kutch Industries Association (FOKIA). “We have urged the government to raise water charges over a three-year period instead of an annual 10% increase. We have also sought that the manufacturer be made to pay 50% of the cost (contractcharge) instead of 80% in case of under utilization,” said a senior FOKIA member. In times of the pandemic, when demand and production took a hit, industries in Gujarat have urged the government to not increase water rates. Ajit Shah, president, Sanand Industries Association (SIA), said, “In Sanand, industrial units get water at Rs 33 per KL. This rate is increased by 10% every year. Due to the Covid pandemic, when manufacturers battled rising input costs and revenue shortfall, we had urged the state government not to increase rates as it impacts our overall cost of production.” Sanand Industrial Estate is home to a bottling plant of a beverage manufacturer in addition to other pharma and chemical manufacturing units, which require relatively higher quantities of water as compared to other engineering units situated there. Always first to be hit by shortage of water supply:High salinity level in groundwater is a serious concern for units in Kutch, making them completely dependent on Narmada water supply. However, whenever there is water scarcity, the first cut is imposed on industrial supply, say industry players. Anil Jain, president, Gandhidham Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI), said, “Certain industries require more water and are unable to survive without adequate supply of water. Just as the government reserves quota for agriculture, there should be a reserve quota for industries too.” Unavailability of pipeline is another concern for manufacturers of bromine and salt-based derivatives, which operate in arid desert areas. Rajendra Shah, a bromine manufacturer, said, “We spend Rs 100 per KL to bring water tankers to meet our needs. There are four units in the Great Rann of Kutch that manufacture bromine and require 8 MLD water. As the units are expected to double, we have asked the government to set up a pipeline infrastructure between Ghaduli and Santalpur in the region to meet growing water needs of existing and upcoming bromine and cement industries.” Similar is the bane of dyeing and printing units of Jetpur in Saurashtra region. “Some 35 units in Dhareshwar GIDC require an estimated 400 KL water a day. We are dependent on ground water and tankers, which is an added cost to our manufacturing process. It’s our long-pending demand to set up a pipeline to divert Narmada water, which will reduce our cost significantly,” said Haresh Bhuva, president of Dhareshwar GIDC association, Jetpur. Textile giants innovate to reduce freshwater intake:Textile major Arvind Limited has deployed a zero-liquid discharge at its fabric manufacturing facility in Santej. Wastewater generated at the factory undergoes a threestage treatment process and is used once again in textile processing, which is a water-intensive procedure. “We recently entered into an agreement with the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation as part of which domestic wastewater is treated and used for textile manufacturing process at our Naroda plant. Our dependence on freshwater use for manufacturing and processing of textiles at Naroda plant is zero,” said Abhishek Bansal, head, sustainability, Arvind Limited. As denim processing requires a lot of water, denim major, Nandan Denim of the Chiripal Group, has been taking similar initiatives to reduce water consumption. “Besides reusing recycled wastewater for denim and shirt manufacturing, we are also carrying out research and development on drydyeing technologies that helps minimize use of water. We have also made fresh capital expenditures for machines and equipment which help achieve this,” said Subrata Ghosh, vice-president, product and business development, Nandan Denim Limited. Desalination plant project still a distant dream:Despite an increasing push for desalination plant to meet growing water requirements in Saurashtra and Kutch regions, little has been done for its implementation. A feasibility report to evaluate the installation of a water desalination plant near Mundra was submitted to the state government last year. However, no progress on this front was made despite industry associations agreeing to share equity for the project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/industries-seek-a-cap-on-water-charges-amid-pandemic-blues/articleshow/86517623.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

The exams were scheduled for September 25 and 26. The sudden cancellation led to an uproar among aspirants who had travelled from across the state to their centres. Health minister Rajesh Tope said the exams had to be cancelled due to the incompetence of the outsourced agency in charge of centre-allotments. Fresh dates for the examinations will be announced within 10 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-health-dept-postpones-written-exam/articleshow/86519526.cms||---

Among the 121 vaccinated persons, who tested positive, 89 had taken both their doses between February and July this year. The percentage of fully vaccinated persons testing positive comes to around 41% while it is 57% including those who have been jabbed at least once. With the projection of a possible third wave hitting the region around September-end or October, the civic body had asked its health department to record the vaccination history among other details of those testing positive in the city. The department started the exercise from August 25 onwards when compulsory institutional quarantine norm was enforced by the NMC. Of all the positive city patients in this span, 56 had a travel history from Amravati to Dubai. Of late, many HCWs and FLWs, who were vaccinated in Jan and Feb have been demanding a booster dose apprehending lack of enough immunity from the Covid infection. Among the 12 positive patients below the age of 18, four kids belong to a family. Though the NMC is recording the details, the datasheet lacks a format showing exact number of patients requiring hospitalization, if they are vaccinated or not, age, gender, travel history, vaccine type, etc. The above details had to be manually calculated from the 30-day record. Clinical details about vaccinated and unvaccinated too were not available. Infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde said NMC must maintain a proper dashboard of vaccinated and unvaccinated patients to track their illness status. “Only when we have a holistic data, we can prepare in advance about an oncoming challenge. We need to know how may patients are needing hospitalization, oxygen support and advanced care,” he said. Regarding patients, Dr Shinde said only those who have taken both doses can be said to have immunity. “At this level, travel history or single dose information is not important. Through proper tracking, we can give a message to people about vaccination,” he said. On kids testing positive, paediatric intensivist Dr Vivek Charde ruled out any major threat to those below 18 years of age. “Same members of a family including kids testing positive was seen during second wave too. Even if they test positive, it won’t be much severe like in adults. As soon as a vaccine is available, all kids must take it,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/41-unvaccinated-among-212-ve-from-city-in-last-30-days/articleshow/86517436.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Police are on a high alert given how back-to-back major crime incidents of gang rape and murder at a jewellery shop had shocked Mysureans.Ahead of the festive season, they conducted a rowdy parade, wherein the top brass directed the history-sheeters not to create any trouble. Police commissioner Chandragupta has also held a meeting of senior police officers to review the law and order situation in the city. Chandragupta told STOI that police are on high alert checking tourists who are entering the city. “Anti-sabotage teams and dog squads are checking the tourists. We are focusing more on places of accommodation for tourists like the lodges, resorts, paying guest accommodations, rental houses and others. We have advised their owners to maintain a register to enter details of tourists before renting them their property and also to verify their IDs. They need to submit tourists’ report to the jurisdictional police station everyday,” he said, adding: “Based on those reports, police will monitor the movement of foreigners.”As there will be a large crowd during Dasara festivities, including people from across the country and abroad, Chandragupta said they are encouraging the public to install CCTV cameras in their commercial establishments. “We are taking the help of owners of major establishments to detect any suspicious material or person through their CCTV cameras. We have asked the public to report to emergency helpline 112 in case they find any suspicious movement,” he said.He added that the number of patrolling vehicles has been increased on the city’s outskirts, especially on outer ring roads and highways during night. “We have identified places where tourists or couples hang out. Traffic police will be on high alert to check vehicles, especially during night,” he said.The top cop said they recently conducted a security check inside the palace. “We are thoroughly scanning the baggage of tourists — it is checked twice at the entrance. CCTVs at the palace are being monitored round-the-clock,” he said.Health camp conductedClearmedi Radiant Hospital (Mysuru) conducted a free health check-up camp for Mysuru Palace Board staff on Friday.Mysuru royal family’s Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar launched the camp which was hosted to screen the staff ahead of Dasara festival. The medical team tested more than 200 staff in the presence of palace board deputy director T S Subramanya and hospital head A R Manjunath.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/city-cops-on-their-toes-to-ensure-incident-free-dasara/articleshow/86513766.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Pune||Centre rules out change in Covishield doses’ interval||PUNE: Dr NK Arora, the chairman of the Covid-19 working group of National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation, on Saturday ruled out any changes in the gap between two doses of Covishield citing scientific studies suggesting the vaccine’s higher efficacy when the interval between the shots was longer. “Any further changes would be based only on scientific evidence and not on random demands,” Arora told TOI on Saturday, stressing that the current interval had been working well. Several states, including Kerala, Karnataka and Maharashtra, are keen to reduce the gap between the two doses of Covishield from the current 84 days. Arora said data from the vaccine tracker platform indicated that the way the Covishield doses were currently being administered was fine. Therefore, there was no need to change it as of now, he said, adding that the vaccine’s effectiveness in the current interval was being monitored constantly. Virologist T Jacob John differed a bit. He told TOI that the Covishield doses’ gap could be reduced to four weeks for individuals at high risk and senior citizens. “They (authorities) should at least think about it,” he said. Explaining his thought, the retired professor and the head department of clinical virology and microbiology of Christian Medical College (Vellore) said, “If someone wants early immunity, give the second dose at four weeks. But if you want the maximum possible immunity, wait for 84 days. Two doses save lives. So, for individuals at high risk of severe disease and death, four weeks’ interval is the best. For them, protection delayed could mean protection denied. For all others between 18 and 60 years, the 84-day interval is logical.” Dr Anish TS, associate professor at Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram, also said a shorter gap could be considered for vulnerable groups like senior citizens and people with comorbidities. “The effectiveness of single dose may not be sufficient to protect them from clinically severe diseases in the context of Delta variant,” he said. Dr MK Sudarshan, the chairman of the Karnataka government Covid-19 technical advisory committee told TOI that they had recommended the Karnataka health minister to reduce the time gap of Covishield doses to about six weeks because there were sufficient vaccines but not enough second dose takers. “There is enough scientific evidence that one to two months’ gap is efficacious,” he said. Dr Rajeev Jayadevan, member, National Indian Medical Task Force on Corona Epidemic, told TOI that a longer gap was better for long-term protection. “At present, it is best to have a longer gap to protect people from severe disease,” he added. ‘No need to vax kids for reopening schools’ There was no need to vaccinate children for reopening schools, said NTAGI task force chairman Dr NK Arora. “What is important is to vaccinate parents, teachers and school staffers before the resumption of physical classes,” he said. The vaccination of healthy children would commence next year, but the immunization of children with comorbidities would start next month, Dr Arora said. He said they were finalising the list of comorbidities in this age group and it would be ready in the next 8-10 days. Virologist Dr T Jacob John said the priority of vaccination for children was not high and schools should reopen before the immunization programme was rolled out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/centre-rules-out-change-in-covishield-doses-interval/articleshow/86517438.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Over Rs 10 lakh material can be bought for C & D waste plant||CHANDIGARH: With the construction and demolition (C&D) waste plant run by the municipal corporation (MC) unable to produce significant quantity of material currently, the general house of the civic body on Saturday allowed the engineering department to purchase material above the amount of Rs 10 lakh from outside areas in markets after taking permission of the commissioner for usage in ongoing works. The move comes at a time when the civic body is planning to mechanise the C&D waste plant with full automatic technology to enhance its capacity to increase productivity. During a discussion of the agenda, officials of the engineering department briefed that when the plant will be mechanised and start producing huge quantity of the products, only the materials prepared in the C&D waste plant be used for road related and other required works. Since the department is facing shortage of materials, the department needed to take material from outside too. Following this, the house approved the agenda. Some of the councillors, however, said there should not be a limit of Rs 10 lakh and there should be permission to get material from outside when required. On this, the engineering officers said they have been getting material from the plant on regular basis, which will fulfil the requirement of less than Rs 10 lakh material. The UT administration has prepared the draft rules of the construction and demolition (C&D) waste policy, aiming to reuse 100% C&D waste in the city after recycling. The charges and transportation modes — private or government —will be finalised after receiving objections and suggestions from public. The UT is aiming not only at the C&D waste of Chandigarh but also of Panchkula and Mohali. Tiles, paver blocksAfter processing the raw material, the machines produce recycle aggregates such as stones, gravel, and mix of debris to make concrete and related material. The recycled concrete goes into making tiles, curb channels, and paver blocks, which the MC uses in different works. Silt, one of the by-products, can be used in filling jobs on construction sites. Last year, the plant was selected as a model unit in the country and former municipal commissioner K K Yadav was called for a presentation in Visakhapatnam to the Smart City project representatives of various cities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/more-than-rs-10l-material-can-be-bought-from-market-for-cd-waste-plant/articleshow/86515558.cms||Deepak Yadav

The directives came during a meeting held to address the highly volatile man-animal conflict situation in Chandrapur, following the request of guardian minister Vijay Wadettiwar. Voicing his concerns over the conflict situation in Chandrapur, Wadettiwar said that 18 people have been killed and 50 others have been injured in tiger and leopard attacks in the district during last six months. He pointed out that there are 117 tigers in forests in Bramhapuri, Sindewahi and Saoli tehsils, and demanded putting chain fencing around the forest villages to curb the rising incidents of predator intrusion in such villages. He said that a proposal worth Rs38.69 crore for fringe villages in Bramhapuri and Sindewahi and another one worth Rs40 crore for fringe villages in Saoli tehsil has been sent to the government. Wadettiwar also reiterated his demand of relocation of excess tigers from Chandrapur, expanding the scope of Jan-Van Vikas Yojna, developing eco-tourism in high wildlife density areas and providing Rs10,000 aid to the farmers who cannot cultivate their agricultural land out of fear of predators. CM Thackeray also issued directives to provide benefits of individual solar fencing to the farmers in the sensitive villages of Chandrapur district, with the objective of reducing human-wildlife conflict. He also approved a proposal for additional funding for the same. Thackeray also directed the officers to build 218 solar borewells and waterholes near them to deal with the problem of shortage of water for the wild animals. The necessary grant of Rs6 crore for it should be provided through Compensatory Afforestation Fund Act (CAMPA) fund, he said. CM claimed that presently, 939 villages are covered under Jan-Van Vikas Yojana and directed the officials to include some more villages under the scheme. The CM also directed to institute a committee to transform Chandrapur Forest Academy into Forest University, following the demand raised by former forest minister Sudhir Mungantiwar in another meeting. The committee will study and evaluate the prospects of converting Forest Academy into Forest University and submit its report. He also directed to appoint an independent person as the director of Forest Academy in order to develop the academy as an autonomous body. He told the officials to complete the work of Forest Academy as soon as possible, and immediately provide necessary grants for the same.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cm-orders-pilot-project-of-fencing-around-conflict-villages-in-chandrapur/articleshow/86517442.cms||Mazhar Ali

The Warje police had arrested the suspect, Swagat Shankar Kamble (28), on September 16. Sometime between 4.30am and 6.30am on September 17, the suspect woke up and noticed that the three constables — on night duty — were asleep, and walked out of the surveillance room of the police station. No one noticed him walking out. The police started searching for the man after realizing that he had escaped from their custody.

---||Rajkot||Rajkot Municipal Corporation exploring ways to make Nyari-2 dam water portable||RAJKOT: As the Rajkot city is growing, with the merging of new areas in its limit, its water requirement too is going up. But with limited sources of drinking water available, the Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) is exploring ways to meet the growing demand. Taking a step in this direction, the RMC is mulling the idea of treating the water of Nyari-2 dam to make it fit for drinking purposes. The civic body has decided to prepare a feasibility report for this purpose. Nyari-2 dam has the capacity of 400 mcft but the water is not potable, it is only used for irrigation purposes. The water has been polluted by dumping of effluent — namely, the sewage water from newly developed areas like Vavdi and industrial waste from nearby factories. Municipal commissioner Amit Arora said that finding new water sources is imperative. “I have asked the concerned department to explore the idea of making Nyari-2 dam water potable. We are going to conduct a feasibility study to compare the cost involved in the project and benefits it would yield. As the city is developing, we have to develop new water sources for the future.” The feasibility study will focus on the cost to be incurred on setting up of tertiary treatment plant and reverse osmosis process. It will also explore the possibilities if any to divert the sewage water to some other place. The reports of recent testing of the Nyari-2 dam water revealed the presence of heavy metal. Also, it’s difficult to stop sewage water being dumped into the dam. Sources said that it will take a long time to connect the newly developed areas with a sewage line. Rajkot’s current water requirement has reached 340 MLD which goes up to 360 MLD during peak summer. Last year the civic body’s requirement was around 280 MLD. RMC draws water from Aji-1 dam and Nyari-1 dam. Even after these two reservoirs reach their full capacity during monsoon, the civic body is forced to purchase Narmada water under SAUNI from the government every year during peak summer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/rmc-exploring-ways-to-make-nyari-2-dam-water-potable/articleshow/86515597.cms||---

On Friday, MMC invited fresh tenders for the project, after the last such exercise in December 2018 failed. The successful bidder chose not to accept the work order citing escalation of costs and other myriad issues. MMC chief officer Agnelo Fernandes said the Rs 3 crore parked in the bank over the last 10 years has accrued an interest of Rs 2.5 crore. After the MMC received the government’s sanction for the remainder of the estimated cost of the project, a fresh tender was floated. While the project was originally estimated to cost Rs 5.5 crore, as per the revised estimates the project, the cost has now been tagged at Rs 6.5 crore. The project had been trapped in a web of bureaucratic tangles and tendering issues over the last few years. The tenders and re-tenders floated by the MMC had evoked little or no response from contractors over the last several years. With the revision of Goa Schedule of Rates (GSR) three years ago, the municipality had hoped that the fresh tenders would elicit good response from the contractors, However, though the MMC revised project estimates, the file shuttled between PWD and MMC until the tenure of the council ended and the project got relegated to the back burners.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/after-several-failed-attempts-margao-civic-body-once-again-floats-tender-for-multi-level-parking/articleshow/86519572.cms||---

Iron grills of the rooms are being replaced with stainless steel and house height is being raised.The modernised houses for chimpanzee, gorilla and orangutan are assumed to be perfectly suited for the apes in captivity. The work is expected to be completed in six weeks’ time.Infosys Foundation chairperson Sudha Murty has sponsored the upgraded enclosures. She inspected the work progress at the zoo recently.Zoo has a separate section for apes which has been a favourite spot for the visitors with chimpanzees Wali and Guru, and gorilla Polo entertaining visitors during their time. They were the star attractions of Mysuru Zoo for decades.The zoo authorities now have plans to display all these greater apes in a renewed atmosphere as per the international standards. The houses are being redesigned with stainless steel grills. The decision for gentle railing has been taken as the apes hold it most of the day when in the enclosure. Sources claimed the 129-year-old Mysuru Zoo approached zoo authorities in Germany from where it had received the apes including Polo in the 1980’s, seeking apes. It was then that the experts laid down conditions and asked them to redesign the enclosure before handing over the apes. Sources confirmed that the zoo has received a gorilla and orangutan which will be displayed once the enclosures are ready. Mysuru Zoo executive director Ajit Kulkarni confirmed to TOI that greater ape houses are being upgraded to meet international standards following suggestions from experts.” Improvements are being made to existing enclosures focussing on animals’ comfort, safety and hygiene. The houses are being sponsored by Infosys Foundation and are likely to be operational in just over a month’s time,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/mysuru-zoo-upgrades-enclosures-for-greater-apes/articleshow/86513773.cms||Lawrence Milton

AP filed a quarterly report with the NGT and sought nine months for implementation of NGT orders for a range of environment protection measures like better handling of bio-medical waste, e-waste management and improving air quality in Vijayawada and surroundings. The NGT had constituted a state-level committee under the chairmanship of Justice B Seshasayana Reddy, former judge of AP high court, on January 16, 2019, for reviewing implementation of waste management rules in AP for a period of six months. But, AP extended the tenure of the committee for another six months. The committee has conducted 12 meetings and submitted status reports to NGT from time to time.  Directions were issued to all urban local bodies in respect of compliance of solid waste management rules, plastic waste management rules and construction and demolition waste management rules. State chief secretary, in the quarterly report to the NGT, said: “The implementation of bio-medical waste management rules for safe disposal of bio-medical waste is satisfactory. In respect of hazardous waste management, we are identifying the best practices for disposal of incinerable hazardous waste for co-processing in cement plants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/need-more-time-for-environment-compliance-ap/articleshow/86518097.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Hyderabad||Tiger population in Telangana’s reserves on the rise but forest area shrinking||HYDERABAD: The tiger corridor from Maharashtra to Telangana’s Kawal tiger reserve has lately become a haven for tigers. The tiger population in the corridor leading to Kawal tiger reserve, especially Adilabad, Nirmal and Asifabad’s Chennur, Sirpur and Kagaznagar forest divisions, have seen an increase in tiger population in recent years. However, with multiple impediments such as widening and upgrading of roads, national highways and railway lines that cut through the tiger corridor and encroachments of forest land, experts say that tigers entering Telangana in search of sufficient prey and territory are now constantly under threat due to the boost in developmental activities. Wildlife conservationists also said that development activities such as recent decisions by the Telangana State Board for Wildlife (SBWL) clearing several proposals for BT roads within the protected areas and areas falling within the tiger reserve can be a huge hindrance for tiger movement. “Kawal was notified as a tiger reserve in Telangana only after taking into consideration the corridor which will act as a passage to the spill over population of tigers migrating from neighboring states. If these roads are passing through core tiger reserve, it cannot be passed by the SBWL and it is also illegal as per National Tiger Conservation Authority,” said wildlife conservationist Diya Sur Banerjee. “All roads are of different categories and there might be few roads which need little bit of widening but most of them are converging from one surface to another. Most of these roads already exist and when different departments come to us for permission, we prepare wildlife mitigation plans. In this process, we insert facilities for wildlife such as under passes and over-passes. When we upgrade these roads, we insist at least three underpasses per kilometer, as per Wildlife Institute of India recommendations,” said additional principal chief conservator of forests Dr Sidhanand Kukrety. The agenda copy of the SBWL, however, states that majority of proposals therein are for either widening of the existing roads and new roads within protected areas. Many big cats have been migrating from Tadoba Andhari tiger reserve and Tipeshwar Tiger Reserve in Maharashtra by crossing Pranahitha river. From Asifabad, the last part of the corridor, they migrate to Kawal reserve other forests in Telangana. Asked about obstructions before tigers migrate into Kawal, Asifabad district forest officer (DFO) S Shantaram said, “Kawal tiger reserve starts immediately after Asifabad. Tiryani forest range near Jannaram is the crucial connecting area between both the areas. There are also other ways but unfortunately, 80 per cent of those areas are encroached upon by non-tribals.” The DFO also pointed out that the increasing number of encroachments of forest areas are forcing tigers to move closer to human habitations, resulting in man-animal conflicts. Last year in November, tiger A2 killed two persons near Digida village in Dahegaon mandal. A woman was also killed near Kondapalli village in Penchkalpet mandal. The impediments also include more than 50 roads which have been sanctioned along the tiger corridor and two railway tracks near the north-south corridor of Asifabad’s Kaghaznagar range. The National Board for Wildlife (NBWL) has given clearance to laying of a third broad gauge railway line by the South Central Railway (SCR) through the tiger corridor area in Kaghaznagar forest division connecting —Kawal in Telangana, Tadoba in Maharashtra and also Indravathi in Chhattisgarh.  “The Sirpur-Kaghaznagar is a vital part of the tiger corridor in Telangana. After the railway line was sanctioned, Telangana forest department conducted a survey and limited the destruction to the tiger reserve. We recommended a clearance for only 21 hectares against the original 189 hectares,” the DFO said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/tiger-population-in-ts-reserves-on-the-rise-but-forest-area-shrinking/articleshow/86517848.cms||Moulika.KV

One of the two students involved in the scuffle fell on Sanjay who then accidentally fell off the window. We are not aware of what triggered the unrest between the students,” V S Hariharan, principal of BITS told STOI. While the kin blamed the college management for not fixing the windowpanes and that resulting in the death of the student, the management argued that maintenance work on windowpanes was underway. They also said that the windowpane was broken by the students themselves. “We had not only warned the students but had also informed their parents about breaking the windowpanes a few days back. Maintenance work of the windowpanes was also underway in few rooms. Therefore, the incident cannot be blamed on us as we are not aware of what triggered the scuffle between the students,” said Hariharan. The college management added that Sanjay lived six or seven rooms away from where the accident occurred. Speaking about Sanjay’s academic abilities, Hariharan said said he was an average student who was pursuing diploma in electrical engineering. “He was an average student with a couple of backlogs. He had the right attitude towards academics and never had a history of scuffles or arguments in the college or hostel. We are not aware as to what led him to go to the room where the scuffle took place post dinner,” said Hariharan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/college-terms-death-as-an-accident-says-no-foul-play/articleshow/86517998.cms||Preeti Biswas

Cops also said that a luxurious car and another suspicious car in which the accused had taken the woman were also seized. “A separate team has also been formed to nab the bootlegger Alpesh Wadhwani alias Alpu Sindhi in connection with a prohibition case. We want to question him regarding this case too,” said ACP D S Chauhan. Senior police officials said that they are leaving no stone unturned to nab Jain and co-accused Raju Bhatt as teams have been searching for them in Gujarat and outside the state too. Police have also initiated a process to get arrest warrants under section 70 of CrPC from the court and attach the properties of the two accused. Meanwhile, sources close to Jain claimed that there is no truth in the complaint filed by the woman. To substantiate their claims, the sources close to Jain are showing screenshots of an alleged WhatsApp chat between Jain and the woman. The chat shows that there were cordial relations between the accused and the complainant until September 16. Her alleged last message to Jain on September 16 was about thanking him and informing him that she was leaving for her hometown the next day. The source also stated that the injuries which according to the woman were caused by Jain and Bhatt were actually caused by Sindhi on the night of September 14. They claim that the next day the woman had called Jain during the early hours to inform him about the incident. “If Alpu Sindhi gets nabbed and they are cross-interrogated the reality will come to the fore,” the source said. It is alleged that the original intention was to extort money from the two accused but when things did not turn out as planned, Sindhi asked the woman to lodge a case against Jain and Bhatt. But police are not buying this theory. “Whatever the woman has said is true and our teams are probing to gather as much evidence as possible. If the accused are saying that they had been honey-trapped then why did they not approach police and give evidence,” said a senior police official.

The Central Agitation Committee (CAC) has decided to once again take up the issue at both state and Centre levels with an aim to "ensure fulfilment of more than half-a-century-old demand". Mahavir Tyagi, president of Meerut Bar Association and CAC for High Court Bench, said, "A meeting will be held on Tuesday to brainstorm on what new strategies should be deployed to ensure our demands are met this time. Representatives of 22 Bars from as many districts of western UP will come under one roof for that." Tyagi added, "One of the demands will be if you can't give us Bench then divide the state into three parts so that such a big area can be managed better. This will automatically solve our problem as a separate HC will have to be established here. We have already given our support to agitating farmers for countrywide Bandh on September 27 in this regard." The Bench in the western part of the state was first proposed by the government in 1955 so that people of the region don’t have to travel all the way to Allahabad for hearings, which is over 600km away. The other Bench is in Lucknow. But ever since, a powerful lobby of the lawyers in eastern UP have been "stifling any attempt by the western UP bar associations to allow a Bench here." "Firstly, we do not have strong political representation in western UP to counter the eastern UP's lobby backed by politicians there. The fact that the CM and two deputy CMs are from the east, so where do we stand? The matter was even raised in Parliament two years ago by our local MP, but the Union law minister put the ball in HC's court saying, 'recommendation has to come from HC itself', a fact which was challenged by the CAC stating, 'the clause of high court’s whole Bench recommendation for formation of a separate Bench does not apply to UP. It is applicable to only those states which are governed by States Reorganisation Act, 1956. UP was not reorganised then. So, the Bench formation can be done only through Parliament resolution,'" said Gajender Dhama, a veteran lawyer associated with the demand for years. Interestingly, two decades ago, the CAC delegation had even secured an appointment with PM Narendra Modi with the demand, but could not meet him due to 'sabotage' by the opponents. "Now, we are again asking for an appointment which may or may not happen," Tyagi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/demand-for-hc-bench-in-meerut-returns-as-up-poll-date-gets-closer/articleshow/86515586.cms||Sandeep Rai

Particular emphasis will be to see that there will be no cases of sexual harassment. Teachers have been asked to be sympathetic when students come up with any complaint or issue. One of the most important thing is to regularly check a Posco box that will be kept in the school to immediately look into any problems that the students may want to bring to the notice of the authorities. “Teachers have to sensitively handle the issues that students may bring up and support them,” DEO Govindarajulu said.

As many as 5,278 students have been allotted colleges as per the merit. Subhash Chougule, secretary of CAP, said, “Many did not secure admission after first round and therefore large number of students had entered second round. The overall response of students seeking admission to city based colleges has come down this time, mainly due to Covid. After two rounds, except for science stream in couple of colleges, the cut off has come down for all streams for all colleges.” The students allotted the colleges must secure admission in next three days. The students, who had not applied for CAP rounds but still want to take admission, can approach respective colleges. “The principals of the colleges where the seats are vacant can hold college-level round if they get large number of applications.

The repair work is essential as the base of the road has been damaged due to landslide. The repair work is expected to take three months, hence tourists visiting the fort premises will have to park their vehicles about 2kms before the fort entrance. Recently, PWD executive engineer CA Airekar visited to the road at Panhala. Sub-divisional officer BR Mali, tehsildar Ramesh Shendge, police inspector Arvind Kale were also present at the site. Airekar said, “It will take at least three months to complete the work of the main road. Water from nearby Sadhoba Lake is also passing through the damaged portion of the road. For this, a big water way will be made, and half meter road will be constructed every day. While carrying out the road work, the walkway from Mangalwar Peth area will be kept as is.” “Work on the alternative road, via Rede ghati area, has not been fully completed due to rainfall. Hence, tourists will have to park their vehicles at Budhwar Peth and walk some distance to reach the entrance of the fort so as to not obstruct vehicles working on the road repairs,” added Airekar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/repair-work-on-panhala-road-to-start-from-tuesday/articleshow/86513803.cms||---

On Saturday, the MC general house approved around Rs 2.50 crore for the project. Earlier, most of these areas got supply from a tubewell, which is now abandoned. The agenda of the work reads, “The said estimate has been prepared for work of providing and laying a new independent pipeline to cater to sector 20-C and D and sector 21 C and D from the water works of Sector 32. The necessity for preparation of the estimate arose as the existing tubewell near the fish market in sector 21-C has been abandoned and the low pressure water supply comes in every summer season from abovesaid areas in both sectors. Subsequently, many tankers were pressed into service to deliver water on a daily basis to these sectors from the water tanker station of sector 15.” It further says, “the existing pipeline is feeding water to sectors 20 C and D and 21 C and D, sectors 32, 33, 34, 44, 45, village Burail, sector 46 and 47. Since sectors 20 C and D and 21 C and D are located at the higher elevation, as a result the water is not supplied and adequate pressure to residents of these areas. And thus it is necessary to lay an independent line for catering both of these sectors.” Sources in the engineering department said since some of the tubewells have been closed and many will close down in the coming days, the city will be connected to canal water. Scattered works in this regard has been going on for the past few months. In the recent past, areas of Dhanas are also being brought under canal water supply. During the meeting, MC commissioner Anindita Mitra directed the engineering department to physically check tubewells across the city to see whether they have been drawing shallow water or have done deep boring.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mc-approvs-rs-2-50-crore-to-lay-pipeline/articleshow/86515590.cms||Deepak Yadav

---||Pune||From volunteers to 24x7 customer care, Elementa society did all to beat Covid||PUNE: The alarm bells rang miles away in the Fareast in January last year. In two months, the inevitable happened in the city — the first Covid-19 case was detected in March 2020. “When the going gets tough, the tough gets going”, goes the adage. The swift action of the Elementa Phase-1 Co-operative Housing Society’s residents early last year to tide over the pandemic was almost an apt “symbolism” for the maxim. The society in Tathawade had padded up by then to pull through the coronavirus crisis. Symbolism, originating in Europe in the late 19th century Romantic Period, is an artistic style of expressing ideas using symbolic images or indirect suggestions. By the time Covid struck the city last year in March, the residents of Elementa society had made lodging arrangements for domestic helps. Over 100 people were given shelter for over three months so that they did not become jobless. some residents fix a stretcher for use in case of an emergency during the pandemic beside a wheelchairA 24x7 customer care line for the members was in place before Pune’s first case was reported. A team of volunteers got essential items delivered to senior citizens and single parents. The society members arranged visits of mobile ATM units and weekly vegetable bazaar. All these helped the residents avoid any possible exposure to the contagion during the Covid-induced lockdown times. The society is reaping the benefits of its members’ hardly work now. It does not have any Covid-19 cases. And almost all the residents have taken at least one dose of the vaccine. Members of the societyAccording to the society’s chairman Parikshit Gohil, not only did they made sure the residents of the society remained safe and the assistance remained available for them always, they also collaborated with NGOs to offer food to the needy during the testing times of Covid lockdown. “RT-PCR and rapid antigen test camps were conducted frequently for the society members to restrict the spread of the contagion. The guesthouse was converted into an isolation facility,” he said, adding that the stay in the facility was not made mandatory for the infected people because many residents had ample rooms in their respective units. Pravin Farad, the society’s secretary, said they kept the record of the positive residents. He said plasma from recovered patients was made available when the plasma therapy was practised earlier. “During the lockdown, we made sure all the residents followed the government guidelines and had barred entry of outsiders, except for those involved in essential services. Once the curbs were relaxed, delivery boys were allowed inside the society,” he said. Resident Ashutosh Sarda said the Covid-19 vaccination camp conducted by the society made sure that the residents did not have to worry about the CoWIN slots or the unavailability of doses. “The vaccination gave us a major relief and confidence,” he said, adding that most of the domestic helps working in the society were also vaccinated. Sarda said the society had halved its tanker dependency for water with the help of sewage treatment plant (STP) in the past two years. “We are effectively using rainwater harvesting and borewell for our drinking water usage,” he said. Resident Prafull Tekawade said the society’s initiative to celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi in the temple on its premises and offering the online glimpse of the daily aarti avoided any social distancing-related issues. Covid-induced norms were followed strictly during the puja, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/from-volunteers-to-24x7-customer-care-elementa-society-did-all-to-beat-covid/articleshow/86517486.cms||Piyush Bhusari

Task Force sleuths said Rajaram Singh, who is from Mirzapur in Bihar, realised that there was a demand for armed security guards and decided to facilitate a fake gun licence by forging documents to needy persons. A few years ago, through an agent, Sonu Pande, he created a forged gun licence with a stamp of deputy commissioner of police, Lucknow, by paying Rs 15,000. After taking the gun licence, he bought a double-barrelled gun for Rs 25,000 in Uttar Pradesh. Using the fake licence, he worked in Jharkhand, Bihar and a few other states before he came to Hyderabad in search of guard duty. While the accused was moving under suspicious circumstances with a weapon, he was nabbed by Task Force sleuths and was handed over to Market police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/guard-with-fake-gun-licence-held/articleshow/86517502.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Eknath Khadse's kin got rights before he called meet over plot, says ED||MUMBAI: A month before Eknath Khadse, in his capacity as state revenue minister in 2016, called a controversial meeting of government officials pressuring them to pay compensation to an owner whose land was acquired by the government’s MIDC department, his wife along with son-in-law already had taken all compensation rights through an agreement, the chargesheet submitted by Enforcement Directorate (ED) in the Bhosari land deal case said. The chargesheet said Khadse was aware of the actual value of the land and the fact that it could not be returned to the government as already structures had been erected on it. Khadse allegedly entered into a criminal conspiracy with the purpose of claiming government compensation for the land through his wife Mandakini and son-in-law Girish Chaudhary. In March 2016, descendants of Rasulbhai Ukani, the original landowner, entered into an agreement with Mandakini Khadse and Girish Chaudhari. According to the agreement, the descendant had transferred his shares in the property to Khadse’s kin. The agreement reads, “Vendor (Ukani family) hereby specifically agree, consent and declare that in the event of any compensation being paid by MIDC of government, for the acquisition of the said land, the vendor hereby relinquishes all his right and interest in the compensation in the favour of purchaser… The vendor will not claim any right in respect of award or compensation money in future.” On 12 April, 2016, Khadse, then revenue minister in the Maharashtra government, called a meeting of government officials by misusing his position and told them to either return the land to its owner or give compensation as per the new Land Acquisition Act. The ED chargesheet said Khadse was “knowing the fact that the said land could not be returned since many companies were already established on it.” Afterwards, on April 28, Mandakini Khadse and Chaudhari entered into a sale deed for the land with legal heirs of Ukani by paying them Rs 3.75 crore. Khadse’s kin spent Rs 1.37 crore for registration and stamp duty. The stamp duty was paid on Rs 22.83 crore, which was the actual government price of the land in the record, to avoid any legal issues. The sub-registrar Ravindra Muley had helped Khadse’s kin to manipulate government records. The land originally belonged to Rasulbhai Ukani, from whom the government had acquired it in 1968 at Bhosari village in Pune. Ukani died in 1981, and the government had not paid any compensation to him. His son (late) Abbas Ukani incorporated his name on the property card of the land as legal heir.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-khadse-kin-got-rights-before-he-called-meet-over-plot-ed/articleshow/86519577.cms||Vijay V Singh
---||Chandigarh||Panjab University Senate polls: Old-timers, young candidates face each other||CHANDIGARH: The Panjab University Senate elections will be held on September 26. Competition for the 15 seats in the graduate constituency promises to be very close this time. While veterans are in the fray, the possibility of young candidates springing a surprise cannot be discounted. A total of 43 candidates are vying for the seats. Sources said eight to nine candidates are likely to secure a seat in the Senate again. Dr Rabindranath Sharma, a senior professor at PU, who has won from the Graduate constituency six times, is at the forefront both in terms of age and enthusiasm. Another candidate, Dr Mukesh Arora is also among the strongest contenders. He has won twice from the teacher constituency and four times from the graduate constituency. Former principal of DAV College-10 Dr B C Joson is preparing to reach the Senate for the fifth time. DAV College Professor Manish Vayar is the likely winning candidate of the DAV Management Committee. Prabhjit Singh, who is working in Mohali as director, education department, is trying for the fifth time. Naresh Gaur, who won Senate elections twice, is working in State Bank of India, PAU, Ludhiana. Naresh is also a strong contender for the third time in the Senate. Naresh, an officer of the bank union, has a good hold on the employees. In SD College-32, Dr Jagwant Singh, former head of the commerce department and general secretary, Pfacto, is preparing for the Senate for the second time. Teachers of Punjab also have a huge vote bank. Sikri Hoshiarpur resident Sandeep Singh, who became the youngest senator in the 2016 Senate, is in the fray for the second time.

The woman had submitted a complaint to the Cyber police station which, after verification, registered an FIR and forwarded it to the Sinhagad Road police on Friday for further investigation. Police said the man and the complainant reside in the same society and were friends on a social networking platform. According to the police, the man downloaded the woman’s photographs from social networking sites and morphed them using obscene images. “The man made a fake profile on a social networking website and uploaded the morphed images there. He also wrote obscene comments on the morphed photos,” said the police. Police said the man also tagged the woman’s friends. She then received calls from her friends and tried to get the photos deleted but in vain. “She was not aware who uploaded the photographs but police tracked down the IP address and it turned out to be her friend,” said police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/man-booked-for-circulating-morphed-pics/articleshow/86517546.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Teen falls from hostel’s broken window, dies||NARSAMPET (WARANGAL): An 18-year-old boy died on Friday night when he mysteriously fell from the second-floor window of his hostel room at Narsampet town in Warangal. He fell down while he intervened in a scuffle between two of his roommates. N Sanjay Kumar, a second-year polytechnic student of Balaji Institute of Technology & Science, was first taken to a hospital in Narsampet. He was later shifted to another hospital in Warangal, where he died. One of Sanjay’s roommates had apparently broken the window on September 22. Sanjay’s family members alleged that instead of fixing the window, the college management insisted that the boys’ families pay for the damage. This led to a squabble between two of Sanjay’s roommates, ending in a tragedy. The college management denied the allegation. “In fact, we had warned the students about the window and even informed their parents. Also, maintenance work of the windowpanes was underway in a few rooms. This room too would have been covered as part of it,” said V S Hariharan, principal of BITS. Narsampet assistant commissioner of police C Phani said a case was registered under sections of culpable homicide not amounting to murder and negligence causing death. Sanjay’s roommates are being questioned on how he fell from the open window. “Two roommates, Shiva Sai and Hari Raju, had argued over a broken windowpane in their hostel room,” Phani said. “Shiva was suspected to be responsible for the damaged window. On Friday, Hari accused Shiva of making life difficult for his other roommates with his behaviour. This annoyed Shiva, who hit Hari and it led to a scuffle.” He added that Sanjay tried to pacify both boys. “We suspect that Sanjay was pushed and he fell out of the open window. We are trying to find out who pushed him.” The incident started when they were having dinner. At the time of scuffle it looked like they were standing on a cot, which was adjacent to the broken window. The room is shared by five students. The boys were using four cots to sleep on while the fifth was used as a dining table and to keep other things. “It is still unclear whether the glass fell after one of the roommates broke it intentionally or accidentally. We do know that before Sanjay fell from the window, the college staff had called the parents of the roommates and informed them about property damage. The boys were reprimanded,” a police official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/teen-falls-from-hostels-broken-window-dies/articleshow/86519595.cms||---
---||Surat||Gujarat: Unwilling to go back to school, 12-year-old Surat boy hangs self||SURAT: In a shocking incident, a 12-year-old boy decided to take his own life as cops suspect that he did not want to go to school which reopened recently after a gap of nearly 18-long months owing to the pandemic. Parth Sahu, a student of class VIII, ended his life by hanging in the bathroom of his home in Pandesara on Friday. Family members were horrified to see him hanging in the bathroom in the evening after he had returned from school normally in the afternoon and also had his meal along with the family. Registering a case of accidental death, Pandesara police started investigating the case and based on preliminary investigation, cops suspect that the boy may have taken the extreme step after his parents didn’t heed to his pleas of not sending him to the school. “It is suspected that the boy did not wish to go to school and he expressed this to his parents recently. Probably he did not like going to school that started offline teaching after a gap of over one and half year,” cops said . Family members told the police that Parth and his father Rambhan, a grocery shop owner, were resting when the boy excused himself to go to the bathroom. Unaware about his horrific plans, the unsuspecting family members went about in their routine work. Later, when his mother opened the bathroom door in the evening, she found the boy hanging and the family immediately shifted him to the hospital where he was declared brought dead. The minor used a rope that he found at his home for the act. “The boy tied one end of a black colour rope to the top of the wooden door through a gap and tied another end to his neck. Initially the family was unaware of it all and came to know about the whole thing probably after a couple of hours only,” said a police official. “It is possible that students, especially young schoolchildren, may not like going back to school owing to the long gap. Some activities should be planned in the school to make kids start liking the idea of going to school again,” said Rudresh Vyas, head of psychology department at MTB Arts College. Police are yet to record detailed statements of the family members. The traumatized family will register their statement only after final rites.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/unwilling-to-go-back-to-school-12-yr-old-surat-boy-hangs-self/articleshow/86515715.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand: Golden fern robs Valley of Flowers of its sheen||DEHRADUN: Lady Joan Margaret Legge, the English botanist whose tomb in the Valley of Flowers would otherwise be covered with flowers of myriad hues during this time of the year, is nowadays swamped by an abnormal invasive plant -- golden fern. Legge had slipped and fell to her death while collecting flower samples in the valley in 1939 and was subsequently buried there. The invasion of the golden fern at Legge’s tomb is indicative of how the plant has spread across the valley, becoming a major worry for the state’s forest department, which has constituted a committee to look at ways for its removal. Known for over 500 different species of flowers, the Valley of Flowers National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage site situated in Chamoli region of the Garhwal Himalayas, had earlier faced a similar onslaught of the polygonum weed. Forest officials claim that they spend Rs 40 – Rs 60 lakh annually to uproot the weed, which grows over 1000 hectares of the total 8,750 hectares of the valley. Officials say that the golden fern is also fast emerging as a dominant species and suppressing blooming of the native flowers, which is why it needs to be declared as a weed. The increased fern growth was first spotted by a team of the national park and some touristsThe onslaught of the fern was noticed recently by a team of the national park as well as some tourists, who brought it to the notice of park authorities. To study the expanse of this invasive species — which is also called interrupted fern due to its irregular and abnormal shape — a two-member committee was constituted sometime back. “The idea behind this exercise is to conserve the native flowering species of the valley and not let any invasive species supress the flowers and then formulate a new strategy to uproot the golden fern,” said Amit Kanwar, director in-charge, Valley of Flowers. A tourist from Delhi, Amardeep Sodhi, who recently visited the valley, told TOI, “Earlier, we would see flowers along the Pushpawati river, but now the area has been infested by golden fern.” Notably, each flower plant of the valley has a special value due to its high-altitude location (11,800 ft) and unique climate in which it blooms (only between June and October). Also, nothing in the valley can be uprooted due to its international status, unless all the clearances are in place and UNESCO is also informed about it as it also funds the valley’s protection. Speaking about the basic behaviour and classification of golden fern, head of the Botanical Survey of India at Dehradun, SK Singh, told TOI, “Climate change has acted as a catalyst for the growth of this fern. Abundant moisture,suitable soil conditions and lack of tourist footfall due to Covid restrictions must have acted favourable for its growth. We have noticed its presence even in the Northeast, but not in the form of a weed as it was not as widespread as in the Valley of Flowers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/golden-fern-robs-valley-of-flowers-of-its-sheen/articleshow/86515712.cms||Shivani Azad

The arrested officer, Nagesh Puranik, had allegedly already taken Rs 4 lakh from the complainant earlier, in exchange for not taking action against her husband and his friend in a car theft case. Puranik, 45, posted at the property cell of the crime branch, was probing an illegal arms case when he found out about a stolen BMW. Investigating the car theft angle led the police to two Navi Mumbai residents. Puranik then contacted the wife of one of the men and asked her to give him Rs 12 lakh to prevent action against them. Sources said she paid him Rs 4 lakh initially, but when he demanded more money, she approached the ACB. Puranik asked her to pay him on Friday. An ACB team laid a trap and caught him red-handed accepting Rs 2 lakh from her.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-api-caught-red-handed-accepting-rs-rs-2-lakh-bribe/articleshow/86519612.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||35% seats for govt in Andhra Pradesh private varsities||VIJAYAWADA: The Andhra Pradesh government has amended the AP Private Universities (Establishment) Rules 2017 making it mandatory for all private universities in the state to set aside 35 per cent of their seats to the government. This new rule would come into force from the current academic year. This is perhaps the first time in the country that one-third of the seats in private universities are reserved for government. While private universities are silent on the state’s decision, education experts feel that the move would benefit the poor and meritorious students if the government reimbursed the fee of such students admitted in private universities. The rule, however, does not apply to deemed universities. These 35 per cent seats under the government quota at subsidised fee are “to benefit the poor children of the state,” the government said and directed the private universities and colleges to submit proposals to be converted into the ‘brownfield or greenfield’ university. The government also categorised the private universities into ‘brownfield university’ and ‘greenfield university’ and laid down several conditions to be recognised in either of the two categories. The brownfield universities are the existing colleges or universities or institutions of higher education, located “in an extent of land not less than 50 acres.” These universities should have NAAC accreditation of 3.2 and above for two cycles or NBA accreditation for two cycles. The brownfield universities should be willing to invest “a minimum of Rs 250 crore furthermore in the course of three years” and possess “tie-up with top 100 universities in the global ranking for joint certification of degrees.” Similarly, the greenfield universities are new institutions without having any educational institutions affiliated to it. The greenfield universities too should be established in an extent of 50 acres of land and should be willing to spend Rs 250 crore in the next three years. The state government also changed the rules making it mandatory for these private universities to “submit the required information such as the details of the fee collection, income and expenditure statements, teaching and non-teaching staff salaries of all kinds, administrative and other expenses, statement of revenue grants received, utilisation of all amounts collected.” The government mandated the payment of salaries to all its employees either through a cheque or electronic transfer, even for the non-teaching staff. “Expenditure shown, without corresponding income, shall be disallowed,” the government said. It also amended the rules authorising the government to penalise universities for any violations. It further said, “if the universities violate any of the conditions stipulated by the regulatory bodies or cause injustice to the students of the universities, the university is liable for appropriate action after giving a reasonable opportunity of being heard.” “It is a welcome move from the government to have its say in the admissions to do justice to the poor students. This intervention (of the government) may not disturb the private university set up or existence,” said Dr MC Das, educationist and former lecturer of Andhra Loyola College. However, the voice of the private universities is different. Though the vice-chancellors refused to be quoted, they admitted that the decision would help the poor students to get admissions. “From the point of the government and the poor students, it is a welcome move. But, it is to be seen on the economic viability of the decision from the universities point of view,” a vice-chancellor observed, while refusing to be named.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/35-seats-for-govt-in-ap-pvt-varsities/articleshow/86519631.cms||Gopi Dara

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh govt begins to attach aided private school posts||VIJAYAWADA: The state government has started the process of taking over aided posts in private schools and colleges and authorised the commissioner of collegiate education and director of school education to complete the task. The state government has already proposed to take over the aided educational institutions or derecognise them by withdrawing the aid. The state government evolved a new system where it has decided to withdraw government aid to educational institutions including aided posts, both teaching and non-teaching. The state government on September 24, issued guidelines giving authorisation to the commissioner of collegiate education to proceed further. On September 25, it issued orders with regard to schools. The officials concerned were asked to take willing letters from the institutions to be derecognised as unaided institutions. The commissioner was also authorised to take consent letters from the managements of the institutions to surrender the aided teaching and non-teaching staff to the government. The commissioner was directed to issue individual orders to the aided staff and absorb them into the government institutions. The decision was taken as the government launched the Jagananna Vidya Devena scheme for full fee reimbursement, Jagananna Vasati Devena for providing maintenance scholarships and Nadu-Nedu for strengthening educational infrastructure. The government constituted a committee on April 6 this year “to study the performance of private aided educational institutions including schools and minority institutions in the state and the necessity, if any, to continue or challenges/concerns/need to withdraw grant-in-aid to these institutions.” The eight-member committee had studied and analysed the performance of the private aided educational institutions in the last three to five years in terms of student enrolment, faculty-student ratio, variance in selection procedure and payment of wages to the aided and unaided staff, financial capacity and revenue generation of the management and finally compliance with the rules and regulations prescribed by the regulating authorities. Accordingly, the committee made its recommendations in favour of withdrawal of the grant-in-aid and absorbing the teaching and non-teaching staff into the government institutions. The government, based on the recommendations of the committee, decided to take over the institutions or derecognise them by withdrawing the grant-in-aid. The decision may not have much impact on the fee structure as the government has already fixed the maximum fee for government and private colleges. “No private college will be allowed to collect fee beyond the fixed amount every year,” said Dr Velaga Joshi, retired principal of the SRR and CVR Government College.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/govt-begins-to-attach-aided-pvt-school-posts/articleshow/86515736.cms||Gopi Dara

It is part of a security blueprint draen up by city police chief Amitesh Kumar for women safety with different components being implemented since February first week. The city police have also identified 58 molesters and 12 rapists who have repeat offences against them. They would be kept under surveillance and slapped with preventive actions. Kumar has started a citywide security audit of different places, especially the vulnerable ones, in relation to women safety. The top cop said that the blueprint is being prepared in the backdrop of a gang rape registered at Sitabuldi police station. “We have already identified vulnerable desolate spots and NMC has been asked to ensure proper illumnation there and setting up of CCTV cameras wherever possible,” he said. A multiagency meeting held on September 9 discussed various issues of women safety, said the CP. Each zonal DCPs has been been instructed to ‘adopt’ one case regarding assaults on women and girls to fast track the legal process. The process has picked up pace post the Sakinaka rape case in Mumbai and such incidents elsewhere too. Meetings have started among women groups and committees like 'Mahila Dakshata Samiti' at the police station level. On Friday, zonal DCP Lohit Matani convened a meeting of women opinion makers, leaders, social activists and others at Lakadganj police station for a feedback on issues of women safety and security at their localities. Matani said police patrolling would be intensified in certain areas where women feel unsafe to go. Action would be also initiated against people visiting desolate places for consuming liquor, narcotics and substances abuse. Matani also said women would be rewarded for their participation in helping police increase security in their localities and for alerts about a crime. Kumar further said that crime records of autorickshaw drivers are being collated and collected from across the city. “The security and rehabilitation process as per the government resolutions of 2015 related to the Nirbhaya incident have been elaborately discussed and made cornerstone of the current security measures,” said the CP. The top cop said that the women at slums and crime prone places are being empowered socially and economically to tackle criminals. “We are insisting on maximum interactions with women and their groups for feedback about security issues in their area or at any place where they feel unsafe or vulnerable. Simultaneously, corrective measures are being taken,” he said adding women are being encouraged to enter into a dialogue with police through online medium too. He also said QR code-based patrolling has been intensified at desolate places and special Damini squads have been activated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cops-begin-home-visit-for-safety-of-400-suvivors-of-sexual-assault/articleshow/86517656.cms||Soumitra Bose

The exercise which has been restarted after almost one and half months was done after the entire residential tower was found to be infected with rising Covid-19 positive cases. Entry and exit points at Megh Mayur apartment in Athwalines and Sumeru Silverleaf in Pal area have been sealed and signboards have been put up to warn outsiders. The buildings will be sealed for 10 days and the containment restrictions will be extended if more cases are reported in coming days, officials informed. A team of SMC’s health department has been deployed at Megh Mayur apartment to ensure that the guidelines are strictly being followed and keep testing the residents. Eight positive cases have been found in four days in two towers of the Megh Mayur apartment, of which, four cases are from two families. In Sumeru Silverleaf, four cases have been found in two days and the cases are not from the same families. “One or two cases are found daily in these apartments and hence, we decided to declare them containment zones. Our teams will keep testing the residents on a regular basis,” said a health official. “Since Megh Mayur is a big residential apartment a team has been deployed to test the residents on a regular interval,” the official added. The first case detected in Megh Mayur apartment has travel history as the infected person had returned from Palitana. However, those found positive in Sumeru Silverleaf have no travel history.

---||Chandigarh||Khattar blames Chautala, Hooda for cash-for-job scams||Chandigarh: Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Saturday hit out at former CMs Om Parkash Chautala and Bhupinder Singh Hooda, who is also the serving leader of opposition, over cash-for-job scams in the state. Khattar’s criticism for the two rival leaders came at the launch of a 24-hour helpline for people to complain about paper leaks of recruitment exams and other wrongdoings in the process for taking a government job. The CM’s attack on Chautala came on a day when INLD staged a show of strength to mark the birth anniversary of former deputy PM Devi Lal Chautala in Jind. Khattar, who also hit out at Congress leaders in neighbouring Punjab, mellowed down his attack on former Punjab CM Capt Amarinder Singh by terming him a nationalist when compared to PPCC chief Navjot Singh Sidhu. “There are people who are identified in Haryana as the founders of cash-for-job scams in the state. They are the ones who had betrayed the youth and promised jobs for all. We are happy we have been able to take the youth out of that system,” said Khattar. Referring to a paper leak scam and the existence of the gangs luring people for government jobs, Khattar said his government had been able to weed out gangs involved in paper leaks. “Now, to ensure this does not recur, we have launched a 24-hour helpline to be operated by Haryana State Vigilance Bureau in a separate cell. Now, we shall bring such people to book,” said Khattar. He said the toll-free number of the helpline was 1800-180-2022. “I urge all aspirants who have been contacted by people who claim to provide question papers for money, to share the information of all such people,” said Khattar. Referring to Amarinder, Khattar said, “He looks to be a nationalist, unlike Sidhu, who has connections with anti-national forces,” said Khattar. BOXES? Pats own back The CM described steps taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi as revolutionary for the welfare of farmers. “Haryana is doing a lot for the welfare of farmers. Directions for doing special girdawari have been given to assess crops damaged by rain. Besides, Beekeeping Policy had been recently launched to promote beekeeping business and encourage farmers to adopt beekeeping,” he said. ‘Rumours about farm laws’ CM Manohar Lal Khattar said though the three farm laws were yet to be implemented, some politically motivated people were spreading rumours about them. He informed that this year, procurement will start from October 1 because of heavy rain. Earlier, procurement had to start from September 25. He added adequate arrangements had been made for smooth procurement Law and Order situation in Haryana is intact The CM said law and order was intact in Haryana. He added the state was also doing well in the power sector. “There was a time when the percentage of line loss and power theft in the state was around 34%; it is now 14% only. A whopping amount of Rs 121 crore has been collected by the power department as penalty,” said Khattar . He said out of 6,700 villages in the state, round-the-clock power supply was being provided in 5,500 villages. Dedicated efforts are being made to give equal employment opportunities to every youth The CM said dedicated efforts were being made to give equal employment opportunities to every youth in the state. Under the State Government’s ambitious Parivar Pehchan Patra scheme, every family having the lowest income is being identified to ensure employment is given to a member to increase the family income up to a minimum of Rs 1 lakh. “Not all can get government jobs, but we are making sure that opportunities are created to offer employment to all in any sector,” said Khattar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/khattar-blames-chautala-hooda-for-cash-for-job-scams/articleshow/86519639.cms||---

It would be taken for discussion while experts are consulted for lockdown relaxations. The chief minister will take a call on opening schools for lower classes,” Anbil, who inaugurated a building for a corporation middle school at Veeriyampalayam, said. Presently, only students of classes IX to XII are allowed to attend offline classes. “Infection rate is different in each district. For instance, districts adjoining Kerala like Coimbatore, Theni and Kanyakumari have more infections. A decision on opening should be taken based on various factors including infection in each district,” the minister said. When asked about the NEET cheating scam in Maharashtra, the minister said it provides proof that the exam is not being conducted properly. “This is why we have been opposing NEET since its inception. The health minister has made a couple of visits to New Delhi to mount pressure on the central government.” When asked about the private school that are forcing students to attend offline classes, he said that the schools have been asked not to insist on it. Rotary Club of Coimbatore Spectrum had constructed the building that has two classrooms, a headmaster’s room and toilets with the help of Baker Hughes at a cost of Rs 35 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/no-decision-on-offline-classes-edu-minister/articleshow/86517659.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||India||Centre plans 3 lakh primary agriculture cooperatives in 5 years||NEW DELHI: In the first major policy statement after the ministry for cooperation was formed, home and cooperation minister Amit Shah on Saturday said the Centre will work with states and expand the number of primary agriculture cooperatives from current 60,000 to 3 lakh in the next five years. Addressing the first national cooperative conference, Shah said, “We will work with all states to take forward the cooperative movement.” Over 2,100 representatives of different cooperatives were present at Talkatora Stadium and nearly 6 crore took part online. Saying that some people wondered why the Centre created this new ministry as cooperatives is a state subject, Shah maintained there could be a legal response to it, but he does not want to “get into this argument”. “The Centre will cooperate with states and there will be no friction,” Shah said and added, “The ministry has been created to bring transparency and strengthen, modernise, computerise and create competitive cooperatives.” About the policy, Shah said a policy was brought in 2002 by the then PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee, and now the Modi government will start working on new initiatives. The gathering, seen in the context of the opposition of unions from Punjab, Haryana and west UP to the new farm laws, can be seen as an outreach to a politically significant section of the farm-rural economy. Stressing that the cooperative movement was more relevant today than ever, the home minister said cooperatives can contribute a lot in the development of the country. Referring to problems faced by cooperatives on taxation and other issues, Shah said he was aware of concerns and assured these will be addressed. “Prime minister has given the mantra, ‘Sahakar se Samridhi’, and he has set a goal of a US $ five trillion economy. The cooperative sector will also contribute to fulfil this goal,” Shah said. He said the cooperative movement will ensure progress of rural India and will also create the concept of a new social capital. “Cooperation is imbibed in the nature and culture of the people of India, and it is not a borrowed idea, that is why the cooperative movement in India can never become irrelevant,” he added. Shah said the country is today standing on a very strong platform and now is the time to set new goals and move forward to achieve them. “Our success will depend on four aspects, resolve, conscience, hard work and spirit of federalism,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/centre-plans-3-lakh-primary-agriculture-cooperatives-in-5-years/articleshow/86521680.cms||---

Addressing the gathering on this occasion, JJP president Ajay Singh Chautala said Devi Lal dedicated his life to raising the living standards of people of Haryana, fighting for their rights and taking them forward on the path of progress. JJP today, in alliance with BJP, was working for the benefit of farmers, laborers and youth, he said. The coalition government had reserved 75% jobs for the local youth in the private sector, he claimed. The government had also taken the decision to provide examination centres in the same district as the applicant and 50% reservation has been provided for women in panchayats. The coalition government has increased the old age pension in 500 days by Rs 500 to Rs 2,500 a month, and in the coming days the promise of Rs 5,100 pension would be fulfilled, he added. Haryana’s deputy CM Dushyant Chautala said the highest statue of Devi Lal was a symbol of unity. “For the development of Haryana, all of us need to work together. Today, the rural areas are also developing fast. JJP is walking on the path set by Devi Lal and is dedicated to strengthening farmers-workmen financially,” he added. He claimed the Haryana government had bought every single grain from the farmers on MSP.

They were claiming that the mandis would be closed, MSP would be stopped and that farmers’ lands will be usurped. he said, adding that “I guarantee you that neither the lands will be usurped nor the mandis and MSP will be stopped”. If anything like that happened, then he and all JJP MLAs would quit immediately.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/jjp-unveils-devi-lals-biggest-statue-in-nuh/articleshow/86519660.cms||---

Party leaders, workers and supporters gathered outside the MC office carrying placards and banners saying “take back hike in water tariffs immediately,” “get rid of stray cattle,” “same pay for same work for MC employees.” Police used water cannons to stop Congress protestors, because of which some of them sustained minor injuries. Chandigarh Congress president Subhash Chawla said the protest was organised to shake the MC into action. He alleged that people were fed up with the anti-people and anti-farmer policies of the BJP. “MC safai karamcharis (sweepers) are not getting salary on time. The problem of drinking water has gone from bad to worse. Overcharging for garbage collection, broken roads and poor condition of dumping ground is posing the risk of serious diseases in Daddumajra,” Chawla said. Demanding cancellation of Lions company contract, Chawla said that MC is paying Rs 53 crore annually to the company to clean the city even though the ranking of the city on the cleanliness index is declining. Box: Walk-out Congress councillors walked-out from the MC’s general house meeting in the beginning. Since Congress councillors wanted to raise some issues, mayor Ravikant Sharma asked him to raise the issue after a discussion over the agenda item.

This after Kewte had already swam for 1.5km during his regular session with friends. Cardiologist Dr Prashant Jagtap and office bearers of Ambazari Jal Sanrakshan Va Samvardhan Samiti on Friday felicitated Kewte for the effort. Kewte, a retired private company employee, told TOI that he has been swimming daily in the lake for the last 25 years. Currently, the lake is filled to the brim. Kewte said on September 19 when he was returning to the bank after a swimming session when one of his friends Prabhakar Bagwe requested him to swim along with him due to strong waves. “Though tired, I swam up to a pole situated 500mt from the bank when one Milind Bhombe apppoached us for help. He started drowning, so I caught his swimming trunk but he was unable to move his hands and legs as water had entered his nose and mouth,” said Kewte. Kewte further said that he asked Bhombe to remain upside down on the water. “I swam below the surface with one hand while pulling him with another hand for around 450 metre. I emerged out of water only for a few seconds to breathe. I started having chest pain. On nearing the bank I shouted for help. One of the swimming coaches Pramod Sahare rushed with a tube and took Bhombe to the bank,” he said. Both Kewte and Bhombe weigh 70kg. Bhombe, a businessman and resident of Bhamti, said, “I have been swimming in the lake for last many years. Due to strong waves, I got tired after crossing the pole. I feared getting stuck in the fish nets. I shouted for help. Sahare pulled me in a tube till the pole. I thought of taking rest at the pole but water had entered my mouth and nose. Kewte and Sahare are my saviours,” he said. One of the medical practioners and regular simmer Dr Manoj Patil, who was resting on the bank, immediately pumped out some water from Bhombe’s lungs. One of the swimmers brought a two-wheeler and took Bhombe up to the road from where he was rushed to Viveka Hospital. Dr Jagtap, one of the directors of Viveka Hospital, said, “Bhombe was in a critical condition. Intensivist Dr Ajay Sakhre immediately started treatment.” Bhombe was admitted for four days and asked to rest for 45 days. Kewte was also part of a three-member team which had saved life of a person who had a cardiac arrest while swimming in the lake a couple of months ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/58-year-old-swims-with-one-hand-pulls-man-for-450mt-to-safety/articleshow/86517811.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

Addressing the 81st episode of his monthly radio programme 'Mann Ki Baat', PM Modi said, "We mark so many days, but there is one more day we should celebrate. It is 'World River Day'. This day is such which is very consistent with the traditions of India." He called September an important month, a month when we celebrate World River Day, and said it is a day to remember the contribution of our rivers that selflessly provide us with water. The Prime Minister said for Indian rivers are not a "physical thing, but a living entity". "As we celebrate World River Day today, I urge the people across the country to mark a 'river festival' at least once a year," he said. "In our scriptures, even a little pollution in the rivers is said to be wrong," he said and urged the people to follow the principles of Mahatma Gandhi "who had done the work of making cleanliness a mass movement" and keep the rivers clean. The radio programme comes after his recently-concluded visit to the United States where he addressed the 76th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/world-river-day-pm-modi-urges-people-to-observe-river-festival-once-a-year/articleshow/86515868.cms||---

In a brazen strike inside a courtroom in the Rohini district court complex on Friday afternoon, gangster Jitender Gogi was gunned down by two shooters alleged hired by his rival. The two assailants, dressed as lawyers, were killed on the spot in a calibrated response by men of Delhi Police’s special cell, who were accompanying Gogi. Former president and member of the Maharashtra Bar Council Avinash Bhide said that the crime in Delhi was indeed serious and there is a need to come out with measures to ensure that such incidents are not repeated in any other court. “I will certainly take up the issue at the upcoming state bar council meeting. The issue is that the lawyers should have more identification details than just the uniform. Though police or security personnel are deployed in courts, there should be more to ascertain the identity of the lawyers,” said Bhide. He added that there should be a name label or pin on the uniform of the lawyer with a bar registration number below it so that the lawyer can be easily identified. Apart from lawyers, a large number of people come to the court every day. At the Nashik district court, police personnel are also deployed for security purpose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/lawyers-mull-over-ways-to-prevent-delhi-like-incident/articleshow/86513958.cms||Santosh Sonawane

These layouts will come up in GS Agraharam (140 acres), Ramavaram (130 acres) and Palavala (93 acres) in Vizag suburbs. The VMRDA sent the proposals to the state government and a government order in this regard is expected to be released in the next few days. The state government is planning to develop MIG plots in the urban local bodies across the state under ‘Jagananna Smart Towns’. The demand survey for the MIG plots under this scheme received about 3.9 lakh applications from the prospective buyers. As part of the same, the VMRDA identified three different land pockets in the district. As per preliminary guidelines of the scheme, the plots will be developed in three different sizes – 150, 200 and 240 square yards. It is proposed to develop these smart townships in about 150-250 acres in the district headquarters and 50-100 acres in the other areas, depending on the requirement after assessing the preliminary demand. VMRDA chairperson A Vijaya Nirmala said the major objective of the initiative is to provide clear title residential plots at affordable prices to the public. “The layouts will lead to integrated development as they will have all the infrastructural facilities. The VMRDA has zeroed in on three land parcels in the Vizag suburbs,” said Vijaya Nirmala. The VMRDA is long planning to develop new layouts in the suburbs as the urban development authority has land parcels on all four sides of the city. The joint venture ‘Fortune Hills’ in Dakamarri was the last layout developed by the VMRDA in 2016. As per guidelines of the Jagananna Smart Towns, the location of site should be such that common facilities like school, transportation, medical facilities, etc. shall be within reasonable disatnce. And the land selected must be free from litigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/urban-body-identifies-three-areas-for-middle-income-group-layouts-in-vizag/articleshow/86515852.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

The Union minister chaired a function to inaugurate and dedicate several roads constructed by the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI). He laid the foundation stone for the six-laning work of the Kagal-Satara stretch of NH 48, which will cost over Rs 4,000 crore. This stretch gets affected by floodwaters and the traffic flow gets obstructed for several days. “I request all MLAs and MPs of these districts to hold a meeting with the NHAI officials and consultant of the six-laning project. They should see the detailed project report first and suggest changes to avoid inundation of the highway stretch. I assure that all modifications will be incorporated and not one drop of floodwater will reach the stretch,” Gadkari said. The local representatives had demanded that the concrete block elevations, which obstruct floodwater, be done away with. Instead, they want elevated highway stretches on pillars. Making Pune-Kagal stretch of highway safer Gadkari also talked about making the Pune-Kagal stretch of the NH 48 accident-free. He pitched in for a road safety audit, for which the funds will be made available by the Centre. He said the safety audit and respective changes made to the Mumbai-Pune expressway helped reduced accidents by 50%. Six-laning work to start soon The Union minister also assured that the work on the Kolhapur to Sangli highway will start in the next six months. “The road was with the state government. The contractor fled. The state government has cleared all liabilities and now they want it to be completed by us.

ED has issued an ECIR under the PMLA based on FIRs by Hyderabad Central Crime Station (CCS) police on the complaint of HDFC Bank alleging that KSBL had illegally pledged the securities of its clients and taken a loan of Rs 329 crore and diverted it. In a second case, Hyderabad police said Karvy directors were booked for defrauding IndusInd Bank to the tune of Rs 137 crore, while Cyberabad police had registered one more FIR (third case) for defrauding ICICI Bank to the tune of Rs 562 crore. “Karvy under the leadership of C Parthasarathy had committed gross irregularities and all the illegally taken loans have become NPAs (non-performing assets). The total loan proceeds taken from multiple banks using the same modus operandi is around Rs 2,873 crore. NSE and SEBI are also investigating the affairs of KSBL. ED is conducting investigation under PMLA against Karvy Group of Companies for their involvement in the offence of money laundering to the tune of Rs 2,873 crore,” ED said. The investigation revealed that KSBL did not report one of the depository participatory (DP) accounts in the filings made between January 2019 and August 2019. KSBL fraudulently transferred shares belonging to its clients to its own demat account (which was not disclosed to the exchanges) and pledged the shares held in these accounts with lenders/banks (HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, IndusInd Bank, Axis Bank, etc.). “The securities, lying in the DP account of KSBL, actually belonged to the clients who are the legitimate owners of the pledged securities. KSBL did not have any legal right to create a pledge on these securities and generate funds. The quantum of such loans taken by KSBL from illegal pledge of shares is to the tune of Rs 2,873 crore. KSBL credited the funds, raised by pledging of client securities, to six of its own bank accounts (stock broker-own account) instead of the ‘stock broker-client account’ and further has not reported these six own bank accounts held with various private banks to SEBI,” ED added. “KSBL did large-scale trading activities in the names of nine companies that included Karvy Consultants Limited (KCL), which is a group company of Karvy, and eight other shell companies, in the guise of doing insurance business. During the investigation conducted under PMLA, it also came to light that crores of rupees were diverted for acquiring immovable properties through the group company, KRIL, and other group companies,” the agency said. The bank statement analysis of these companies revealed that there was large value rotation of funds between the Karvy Group Companies and the shell companies’ bank accounts. Earlier, ED had recorded the statement of Parthasarathy at Chanchalguda jail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ed-freezes-rs-700-crore-worth-shares-of-karvy-cmd-kin/articleshow/86519695.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Coimbatore||Perseverance pays off for TN’s UPSC topper||Coimbatore: When Narayana Sarma, 25, a resident of Kanuvai here, could not clear the UPSC civil services exam last year in his second attempt, he was adamant about giving it another try. When the results were declared on Friday, Narayana obtained the all India 33rd rank and emerged state topper. Asked if he would give it another shot if he was unsuccessful, Narayana said yes without a second thought. “The interview panel asked me the same question. I said I’ll do it again and support my family by taking up a job and simultaneously prepare for the exam. The interview board expects candidates to be bold and positive. They want to check if the candidate is capable of managing big responsibilities in his career,” he told TOI. While repeaters face more pressure and are put under scrutiny by the interview panel as they have the added advantage of having appeared for the interview already, Narayana said he was focused and confident. “I could only clear prelims in the first year. I went up to interview but could not clear the next year. I decided not to give up and tried once again. I see this success as the outcome of my perseverance and the support of my family,” he said. Narayana, who hails from a middle-class family, is the only son of private health insurance agent parents in Coimbatore. It was not easy for the parents to face the society when their son graduated from a big institution without a job. He started nurturing the dream of becoming a civil servant during his graduation and found civil service as one of the means to become the Reserve Bank of India governor one day, which was his father’s dream. A Reyaz of KPR IAS Academy in Coimbatore, who trained Narayana, said that he was one of the promising candidates. “Ten candidates from my academy have cleared civil services this year,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/perseverance-pays-off-for-tns-upsc-topper/articleshow/86517756.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||Arjun Rampal’s partner’s bro held in Goa drug raid||PANAJI: The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) conducted three different raids in Goa and arrested four persons, including Demetriades Agisilaos, brother of actor Arjun Rampal’s partner, and recovered hashish, LSD blots and MDMA/ecstasy pills. Agisilaos, a South African national, has been arrested by the NCB for the third time in a year. He was first arrested last year while the NCB was probing a drug case after the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput. “We seized a small quantity of hashish/charas from his house in North Goa. He was produced before a court which remanded him in judicial custody till Monday,” NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede said. “Agisilaos was earlier arrested twice by our teams. In the second case, he was arrested when we were investigating a cocaine peddling case. The drug was coming from Nigeria,” Wankhede said. The NCB had last year questioned Rampal and his partner Gabriella Demetriades while it was probing a drug case. Rampal, who is currently filming in London, in a statement, said, “It’s unfortunate that my name is being unnecessarily dragged… though I have no association whatsoever. As far as my family and I are concerned, my direct family and I are law-abiding citizens.” “ And while the incident involves a person who is a relative of my partner, I have no other connection or relationship other than that with this person,” he said. Wankhede said during the past two days, the NCB had conducted narcotic raids in Goa based on specific inputs and its main target was to identify suppliers and dealers who provide drugs at parties. He said as tourism has commenced in Goa, NCB will continue with its raids in a bid to make the state drug-free. In the first raid, NCB seized a small quantity of hashish/charas from Agisilaos’ house at Chopdem, Pernem. Subsequently, Agisilaos was arrested for illicit possession of the recovered drug. In the second raid, NCB seized 12 LSD blots weighing 0.2gm (commercial quantity) and a small quantity of MDMA/ecstasy pills at Siolim and arrested Noumaan Savery, 22, a resident of Chhattisgarh. Wankhede said during the follow-up investigation, another accused Siddiq Ahmed, 25, a Hyderabad resident, was also arrested. During investigation, it was revealed that both the arrested persons were working at a bar and restaurant at Anjuna. He said a case has been registered against Savery and Ahmed at NCB, Goa sub-zone, and both are in judicial custody. In the third raid, NCB seized 10 MDMA/ecstasy pills weighing 04.08gm from Nagoa and arrested Mayur Mohnani alias Amit aged, 22, a resident of Thane, for illicit possession of drugs. A case has been registered against Amit at NCB Goa and he is also in judicial custody. This is the second major raid by NCB in Goa this month. On September 7, NCB had raided three places in Goa and Maharashtra and intercepted four persons, including one Nigerian national, and had confiscated around 45kg of various types of narcotic substances.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rampals-partners-bro-held-in-goa-drug-raid/articleshow/86519692.cms||---

Dubey, who studied at the Margao-based school for a few years before moving to Pune, topped her matriculation batch in 2003, said Manovikas’ founder-director Therese Almeida. “All the publicity she has received is well deserved. It’s not just about having a good position. We are proud to see her do something more and help create a better world. Sneha is working for the country and is in the public eye, and we are delighted. We were taken up with her forceful speech,” Almeida said. She remembers Dubey as a confident girl who had a lot of friends. “She was outstanding in everything she did and was very popular. I recall her being very communicative with everybody,” she said. Dubey lived in Colva for a few years. Although she joined school late, she quickly adapted, said former principal Srabonee Thakar. “She had clarity of thought right from a young age, and you could tell she was well-read and well informed. She was very soft spoken but firm. We couldn’t be prouder of her,” she said. “She spoke so clearly with so much conviction and confidence. It has not only made her teachers, but also every Indian proud. It also speaks much about the empowerment of women and shows how powerful women have become in today’s world,” Thakar said. Almeida said what Dubey spoke needed to be said. “If we are quiet and toned down about everything, Pakistan will start taking advantage for no reason at all. I feel very sorry for the state that they’re in,” she said. A school friend, Danika Lobo, said that Dubey has turned into a role model par excellence. “We are proud of the stand she took and the way she put forth India’s sentiments so eloquently. She is representing India at the highest level and is an epitome of passion and inspiration, which is wonderful,” Lobo said. Another senior teacher and former headmistress of the school, Geeta Chopra, said that Dubey was right in the tough stand she took. “She used diplomatic yet strong words and sent a strong message to Pakistan to behave itself,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/soft-spoken-but-firm-sneha-had-clarity-of-thought-remember-manovikas-teachers/articleshow/86519710.cms||Lisa Monteiro

The Karamadai police said the 15-year-old girl, a class VIII student of a higher secondary school, had gone missing from her house on August 29 and her parents had lodged a missing person complaint with them on September 1. “We traced her to a village near Karamadai, where she was living with her 17-year-old boyfriend, on Friday. Inquiry revealed that the girl had eloped with him, who had sexual relationship with her after marrying her. So, we altered the missing person compliant and registered a case under Section 366 (A) (procuration of minor girl) of the Indian Penal Code, Section 9 of the Prohibition of Child Marriage and Sections 5 (l), 5 (n), read with 6 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act and arrested the boy,” a police officer told TOI. The minor boy was produced before the juvenile justice board the same day and sent to the observation home for juveniles. The minor girl was sent to the government-run shelter home for women at Ukkadam. The 22-year-old man was, meanwhile, arrested by the Thudiyalur all-woman police on Friday for molesting the 14-year-old girl, a Class IX student of a private school. A police officer said the girl had fallen in love with her relative B Gopinath during her visits to his house in Trichy district. On Friday morning, a police officer said, the girl’s father followed her secretly to Mettupalayam bus stand, where Gopinath was waiting for her. “He caught them and handed them over to us. During inquiry, we came to know Gopinath had molested her on several occasions. We received a complaint from the girl and registered a case against Gopinath under Section 9 (l) read with 10 of the Pocso Act.” Gopinath was later produced before the special court for Pocso cases and lodged in jail under judicial custody. The girl was sent to a shelter home for children at Ganapathy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/17-yr-old-boy-held-for-raping-minor/articleshow/86517780.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Thiruvananthapuram||No new registration for 5 days||Thiruvananthapuram: The Kerala University would not entertain any new registrations for admission to degree programmes between September 25 and 29. For candidates who have cleared the qualifying examination by appearing for the ‘save a year examination’, the varsity would give a chance for registration after the supplementary allotment, the university informed here on Friday. Meanwhile, the Kerala University syndicate meeting here on Friday did not discuss the pension revision agenda, as the varsity is yet to get a clarification from the government regarding the revision. Though the state government had issued orders revising the pension of the university pensioners, the Kerala University has taken a stand that the government suggestion about the financial burden of the pension revision to be borne by the university itself was not acceptable. The varsity would need to raise Rs 2 crore per month to meet the revised pension expenses, apart from Rs 50 crore it would require to meet the disbursement of arrears. The higher education department has recently taken the stand that the Kerala University has Rs 270 crore as special fund for the pension purpose and hence there was no government aid required. The syndicate has also decided to sanction Rs 15 lakh for the Harithalayam project for farming activities in Kariavattom campus. The syndicate has also sanctioned Rs 5 lakh for giving agriculture fellowships to students. Based on a letter from the varsity former vice chancellor B Ekbal, the syndicate has decided to explore the possibility of republication of ‘Kerala Sahitya Charithram’ by Ullur S Parameswara Iyer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/no-new-registration-for-5-days/articleshow/86491934.cms||---

---||Coimbatore||Expressway work on Avinashi Road may foil metro rail project in Coimbatore||COIMBATORE: The ongoing elevated expressway project on the Avinashi Road is posing a challenge to the proposed metro rail project on the stretch. While pillars are being erected for the over 10km-long highway project estimated at Rs 1,600 crore, minister for public works, highways, and minor ports E V Velu said on Saturday that the pillars cannot be utilised for the metro project. He was responding to members of Kongu Global Forum and Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ICCI) Coimbatore, who sought measures for infrastructure development of western region to encourage industrial growth. Citing a study carried out recently to explore if the pillars erected for the expressway can be utilised for operating metro on the same route, the minister said the design of the bridge was found to be not suitable for metro rail operations. “We explored the possibility of operating tram on both sides of the pillars. But it would require eviction of shops on both side, which may invite people’s ire. I am not able to give any assurance on the metro train project on the Avinashi Road. But the survey is underway on the other three routes including Mettupalayam Road, Trichy Road and Sathyamangalam Road,” he said. The state government has allocated an additional Rs 15 crore to construct ramps at six places on the expressway for vehicles to get down and climb up the flyover, Velu said. Speaking about the Coimbatore international airport expansion, the minister said land acquisition will be expedited for speedy completion of the project. On the uneven stretches of the 23km-long L&T Bypass from Neelambur to Madukkarai, the minister sought to find a solution within a week after speaking to L&T, which is constructing the bypass. “Major road projects are being given importance in the city. Development of Coimbatore is a priority of the state government. We would extend support to its infrastructure needs. The Coimbatore – Karur Road expansion work has been finalised and the work will be completed in the next two years,” he said. The meeting was also attended by MPs in the western region including Coimbatore MP P R Natarajan, Pollachi M P K Shanmuga Sundaram, Nilgiris M P A Raja, Tiruppur M P K Subbarayan, Namakkal M P A K P Chinraj, Erode MP Ganeshmurthi, Karur MP S Jothi Mani, Salem MP S R Parthiban and Dindigul MP P Velusamy besides forest minister K Ramachandran.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/expressway-work-may-foil-metro-rail-project/articleshow/86517824.cms||---

---||Goa||Goa: TMC in touch with netas across parties for 2022 polls||PANAJI: Riding high on its Bengal victory, Trinamool Congress has decided to enter Goa with all “seriousness” and will contest the assembly elections scheduled for early next year. “We are not here to (just) participate in the 2022 election but to win the elections. That’s the seriousness we are going ahead with,” Derek O’Brien, its parliamentary party leader in Rajya Sabha, who has been camping in Goa for the past few days, told TOI. Indicating that TMC is in touch with several politicians cutting across party lines, he claimed they have been attracting “good people”. O’Brien: TMC will even get BJP votes, like it happened in WBHe also said the party would field formidable candidates in the elections. “TMC in Goa will be a party of the people of Goa, by the Goans and for the Goans. We are a federal party and there is no high command culture here,” Derek O’Brien said. Making it clear that they are ready to take on BJP, he dismissed the argument that entry of TMC would further divide non-BJP votes. “The question doesn’t arise, as we’ll get even BJP votes, the way it happened in West Bengal,” he said during an informal interaction. O’Brien, who has been having meetings with politicians, professionals, civil society members and others since his arrival in Goa on Friday, declined to reveal the party’s plans but said Goa will know once things begin to unfold next month. He also refused to name any politician that the party is in touch with. Sources in TMC told TOI that the party will open its office next month after which West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee will visit Goa. “They are already scouting for office space and by October, the party organisation will start operating fullfledged here,” sources said. They also said the party has been in touch with some senior politicians for some time now and their joining will take place next month. As reported earlier by TOI, one is being offered a Rajya Sabha seat. A party official said TMC has done a lot of groundwork before deciding to contest the Goa polls. “The decision was taken by Didi and her team after the political strategy agency engaged by the party submitted its report,” O’Brien said. A team of 180 persons of political strategist Prashant Kishor’s agency was in Goa for over two months before preparing a report on the political situation in the state. They found that there was strong resentment in the state against BJP and that there was space for a formidable opposition to fight the saffron party, TMC sources said. Analysing the reports, TMC’s core committee decided to expand its base in Goa, besides Tripura.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-touch-with-netas-across-party-lines-to-contest-polls-tmc/articleshow/86519742.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Custodian moves in as squatters pitch tent in enemy property||HYDERABAD: The custodian of enemy property of India (CEPI) has asked the Telangana government to help remove encroachments from what is touted as the single largest enemy property in India on the outskirts of Hyderabad. Spread over more than 650 acres in Kothwalguda village of Shamshabad mandal in Rangareddy district, this sprawling chunk of property spans over 100 survey numbers straddling either side of the Outer Ring Road. The property belonged to Syed Qamruddin Hasan, the son of a famous lawyer from Hyderabad, Syed Mohd Hasan Abedi. It became an enemy property when its owner Qamruddin Hasan migrated to Pakistan in the late 1960’s. According to realty experts, prices of land in Kothwalguda are between Rs 2 crore and Rs 5 crore per acre for areas falling under the GO 111 belt and from Rs 5 crore to Rs 10 crore per acre for land outside the banned area. CEPI is learnt to have been steadily pursuing the case with the state government over the past one year due to the threat of encroachments looming large as land sharks set their sights on it. Finally, the Telangana government issued an order in the second week of September, directing the Rangareddy district collector to survey the land and prevent any encroachment. The collector has been asked to “undertake a survey of all survey nos (enemy property) and prepare a comprehensive report about the status of subject land, including details of encroachments”. The collector has been directed to “stop construction activities on the above survey numbers immediately and eviction proceedings to be initiated against the encroachers”. When contacted, CEPI Saurav Ray, who is inspecting enemy properties in Uttar Pradesh at the moment, told TOI that his office had taken up this case on top priority. “We are vigorously pursuing the case with the state government. However, I am not authorized to share any details of this case,” Ray said in an emailed response. Ray and his team has already inspected the Kothwalguda property along with other team members. Interestingly, Ray was the man who blew the whistle on the Adarsh Cooperative Housing Society scam when he was managing defence land in Mumbai circle as defence estates officer in 2001-02. According to sources, the objective behind the exercise is to ensure that enemy property worth thousands of crores of rupees is free of encroachments and can be monetised by the government. Sources said that CEPI has been pressing the Telangana government for quick action in the matter as encroachments have been rapidly springing up on the property, a part of which falls under the purview of GO 111 that bans construction in the catchment areas of Himayatsagar and Osmansagar. However, GO 111 has failed to stem the tide of illegal constructions that have overrun parcels of land in areas under the ban.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/custodian-moves-in-as-squatters-pitch-tent-in-enemy-property/articleshow/86519745.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

Part of the Centre’s strategy to tap the tourism potential of khazan lands on an “experimental basis”, the project will be developed by a private party, with expertise from the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) The project, along the lines of the spice plantations in kulaghars, is planned to serve as an educational centre for visitors on the importance of khazan ecosystems, agri-pisciculture practices, and traditional methods of farming in Goa. The GCZMA has said that it has approved the project for its unique methodology. It was observed that on the land where the project has been proposed, agricultural activities have not taken up over the past decade due to saline water ingression. “The proposal aims to revive the khazan agricultural system through a scientific approach. Education and research play an important role in reviving/restoring the ecosystem. Revival of these practices for sustainable utilisation of land is a priority. This can be achieved by creating facilities where people can come and understand, cultivate skills through hands-on training,” stated the project proposal. Twenty-one temporary shacks will be set up using eco-friendly material on the landward side. A coastal ecology information centre, signs explaining the importance of khazan lands and traditional agricultural crops along with pisciculture, and training centres with stay facilities for tourists and visitors are part of the proposed project. ICAR has already been brought on board as scientific and technical partner, a retired scientist of the National Institute of Oceanography, who is helping document the species diversity of the area, which will be used to develop the training and educational material for the centre, the project proponent told GCZMA. Mangrove and bird tourism in association with Goa forest department has also been proposed as part of the project. “The facility created can also be utilised as a training and capacity building centre for locals, students, teachers, and any other stakeholders interested in revival of khazan lands,” the proponent told GCZMA. The GCZMA has said that it has approved the project looking at the need for revival of the khazan ecosystem and the unique methodology proposed for it. The GCZMA’s conditions state that land use of the project site should not be changed and that educational research activities should be taken up at the centre in Chorao. “Visitor/tourist carrying capacity may be undertaken to ensure that strict compliance of visitor/tourist number is maintained,” the GCZMA has said. The GCZMA has also said that only eco-friendly materials like bamboo should be used for construction at the project site.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-permits-pvt-player-to-build-eco-project-at-chorao/articleshow/86519801.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar
---||Goa||Goa: Govt trains students to weave kunbi sari||PANAJI: Goa’s traditional kunbi sari got a new lease of life some years ago after it was promoted on the ramp by eminent Goan fashion designer Wendell Rodricks. Now, the cotton-chequered, red-and-white handloom product is being woven by a group of experts from the department of handicrafts, textiles and coir at the premises of the directorate of art and culture at Patto as part of a training programme for students across Goa. Savita Mittar, a junior craftsman at the department of handicrafts, textiles and coir, said it takes an entire day to weave a metre of the sari and so far, she and her team have managed to complete four saris. Their objective is to complete weaving 10 saris while teaching the students this unique craft. “The work is so meticulous that even if we make a mistake with a single thread, it takes 10-15 minutes to readjust the loom. The threads are delicate, so the work demands the craftman’s complete attention,” she said. So far, they have trained 32 students, with each group requiring a dedicated 10 hours of training to learn the craft. Sometimes, forming a single knot takes a student up to two days to learn. The trainees are not directly allowed to use the handloom. They are, instead, taught to spin the thread on a spinning wheel (chakra) and then trained in the denting-grafting technique. “The objective is to make them ‘atmanirbhar’, or self-sufficient, while also helping to revive one of the dying arts of Goa,” Mittar said. Ramdas Gaude, another craftsman, said he had learnt the trade only in recent years, following which he has begun training others. “There is demand for rare arts and crafts, and exploring an opportunity in this field for new learners has a lot of scope now, especially since there are schemes to support them,” he said. The trainees presently use the machines installed at the directorate of art and culture to learn the art. However, if they wish to purchase a handloom and the other machines involved in creating a kunbi sari, the staff is willing to help them claim subsidy through the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (Nabard).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-trains-students-to-weave-kunbi-sari/articleshow/86519777.cms||Nida Sayed

The operation was carried out in association with the city police’s Special Operation Group (SOG). The drugs seized include imported hybrid marijuana, hashish, LSD, capsules, mephedrone and other varieties. Sources claimed that drugs weighing nearly one kilogram were seized from the couple. The exact value of the seized drug is yet to be declared by the top anti-narcotics agency of the country. Sources in police informed that, considering the types of the drugs and its quantity the total value of the complete seizure must be in crores. Sources said that both the accused are around 30-year-old. The drugs were seized from different locations of the city. The seized products have been kept in the custody of city police while its samples were collected to be tested at a forensic science laboratory in Delhi.

The 27-year-old said self-study, not coaching, helped her crack the exam. The engineering graduate’s father works with UP Gramin Bank and is currently posted in Saharanpur. Listing her priorities, Sadaf said she would ensure that no girl was deprived of education. The state topper said, "My parents have been a pillar of support. I had to fight stereotypes. Also, there is this mindset that a girl should be married off at the right age. A lot needs to be changed. I have opted for UP cadre and aim to work for women empowerment and girl education." She added, "I used to work for an American bank in Delhi after I completed my BTech (chemical engineering) from NIT Jalandhar. Later, in 2018, I decided to concentrate on my UPSC preparation. I was confident that I would crack the exam without enrolling into any coaching centre. While preparing for JEE too, I never took tuitions. Recently, I cleared RBI officer-level exam." Another candidate from Nainital Shailja Pande secured the 61st rank and aims to improve the education standards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/roorkee-girl-ranks-23rd-in-upsc-says-self-study-behind-success/articleshow/86515937.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand government's ‘communal tension’ alert creates furore||DEHRADUN: A day after issuing an official communication fearing ‘communal tension’ over the ‘influx of outsiders’ in certain areas, the Uttarakhand government chose not to divulge any details about areas under the radar or why it was apprehensive about these places. Additional chief secretary (home) Anand Bardhan, when asked about specifics of the alert, did not comment on which areas are under the radar and if any communal violence had been reported which had led to the alert. “We had received some factual inputs, following which the directions have been issued to district authorities and police. We do have information about some areas and are doing a fact-check,” the official told TOI. In a similar vein, government spokesperson and agriculture minister Subodh Uniyal said, “The move has been initiated by the home department on the basis of some inputs. It is important to ensure that social harmony is not disturbed and illegal activities are kept in check.” Meanwhile, opposition Congress accused the ruling party of misusing the official machinery to further its agenda before the 2022 polls. “If there are specific inputs with the government, it should tell people about these areas and also about how many cases of communal clashes have been reported there,” former CM Harish Rawat said. “If these steps aim at targeting only a particular area or a particular community or are being taken for political mileage by using the administration, then the issue needs serious consideration,” he added. As reported by TOI on Friday, the Uttarakhand government, in an official communication, had stated that it had come to its notice that “rapid population growth in some areas of the state had led to a demographic shift, whose ill-effects had started showing in the form of migration of people of certain communities”. The official release had further stated, “There is a possibility of communal atmosphere getting vitiated in some places. Expressing concern over the situation, the government has directed the DGP, all district magistrates and SSPs to take precautionary steps to address the problem. They have also been told to set up district-level committees, which would give suggestions on the issue.” Apart from this, the release added, the government had called for the formation of peace committees in various areas, saying “meetings of these committees should be organised from time to time.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/officials-tight-lipped-on-specifics-of-ukhand-govt-order-on-communal-tension/articleshow/86515911.cms||Kautilya Singh

Nirmalakumari of Kodiparambil house is the deceased. The police suspect it to be a case of suicide based on a handwritten note which was recovered from her bedroom. The police said that Nirmalakumari was found dead by her husband Damodaran Nair in the morning. He immediately alerted their son Arunkumar, who lived in a house nearby along with his wife and children. Later during the police investigation, they found the handwritten note from her room. In the letter addressed to her family and relatives it was stated that no one else was responsible for her death. Arunkumar confirmed that the handwriting on the letter was that of his mother’s. However, the police have sent it to scientific experts for detailed examination. Arunkumar also told the police that Nirmalakumari, who was a preschool teacher, was ailing from memory loss recently. Malayinkeezh sub inspector R Rajesh said that she might have poured kerosene over her head and set herself on fire. The fire might have damaged her mouth and vocal cords, which explain why no one heard her screams, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/septuagenarian-woman-found-dead-near-home/articleshow/86492018.cms||---

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Double delight as brothers crack CS exam||VISAKHAPATNAM: In what could serve as a major inspiration to civil services aspirants, Rallapalli Jagat Sai and Vasanth Kumar, two brothers from West Godavari district, cleared the coveted civil services examination, 2020, despite their humble background. The Union Public Service Commission released the final results of the civil services exam on Friday. Many years of hard work and grit paid off as Jagat Sai, the elder brother, secured 32nd rank in his fifth attempt to secure the country’s top administrative post (IAS), while his younger brother Vasanth Kumar got 170th rank in his second attempt. Vasanth Kumar is expected to get IPS. Speaking to STOI, Jagat Sai explained their journey and how they beat all odds to crack the exam. “After pursuing my mechanical engineering from a deemed university in Vellore in 2014, I joined an MNC in Pune. But I had to quit the job after a year to prepare for CS exams. Even though I appeared for the interview two times before, I could not crack it. Self-actualisation and introspection helped me rectify my mistakes and finally emerge successful in the interview,” he said. Vasanth Kumar, who completed his electrical engineering from a private college in Visakhapatnam in 2018, joined his elder brother in the preparation for the exams. Kumar, who could not clear his prelims in the first attempt, qualified in his second attempt with anthropology as optional subject. “Lack of mentoring or correct guidance might have hampered my chances in the earlier attempts. I had no option other than self-correcting and self-learning from my own mistakes. Those aspirants, who attended the interview along with me last year, helped me this time. My parents are happy to see both of us cracking the coveted exam,” Sai said. When asked about the message for the civil services aspirants, Sai said starting the preparation as early as possible is the key to success. Seeking mentorship from experts or in-service officers would also help, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/double-delight-as-brothers-crack-cs-exam/articleshow/86515910.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

To start with, the department will create awareness among students in Dehradun and neighbouring Mussoorie. Today, forest officials met over 60 principals and schoolteachers at the forest headquarters in Dehradun and sensitised them about the need to involve students in activities focusing on nature conservation. The Wildlife Week will see intensive hand-holding of these school eco-clubs by the department in collaboration with organisations such as Title Trust and Nature Science Initiative. Head of forest force Rajiv Bharatri said, “The department will provide books compiled by the forest department, attractive posters for display, audio-visual films for teaching and souvenirs, entry to tiger reserves as well as camping in forests with forest staff at regular intervals under the guidance of experts in order to inculcate conservation ethics, love for nature, wildlife and environment among children of schools.” Incidentally, the department is working out ways to reach out to students with the message of conserving nature in a big way. Recently, the department launched a ‘bilingual’ Hindi-English website ‘Nature Vidya’ for students. The portal is being run by Nature Science Initiative and Jankidevi Bajaj Gram Vikas Sansthan which envisions to involve every kid in conservation activities, depending on his/her inclination. Various topics ranging from climate change, wildlife conservation, solid waste management, protecting forests and rivers can be understood and learnt through the website with some interesting tools. “When environmental education is imparted systematically, children learn to solve problems and opt for careers that address issues related to climate,” said Soumya Prasad, research scientist, nature science initiative.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/students-of-eco-clubs-to-participate-in-wildlife-week-in-a-big-way-forest-dept-to-lend-support/articleshow/86515961.cms||Shivani Azad

---||Navi-mumbai||Maharashtra: Activists highlight oil, tar pollution at Raigad’s beaches||NAVI MUMBAI: Environmentalists have complained to the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board and other coastal authorities, as well as written to state environment minister Aditya Thackeray, to put a spotlight on the presence of black oil and tar balls along several beaches in Raigad district. Activist Sumaira Abdulali of Awaaz Foundation told TOI: “In the past four days, the presence of dirty black oil, and also oil tar balls have been noticed along the famous beaches like Kihim, Kashid, Nagaon in and around Alibaug coast.”  Besides complaining to the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board and other coastal authorities, Abdulali has also written to the state environment minister Aditya Thackeray, reminding him about the `Race to Zero' campaign ahead of Climate Week NYC 2021; as part of Global Citizen Live Campaign. ``This adrift oil in sea seems to be coming to the shore from certain big vessels and ships off Mumbai coast. Besides oil on beaches, I have also noticed heavy industrial air pollution, as chimney's close to Dharamtar creek in Raigad are releasing multicoloured fumes. These factors are not good for the environment,'' said Abdulali. Member of the Bombay high court appointed Wetlands Protection Panel, D Stalin, said: ``It has come to my knowledge that many ships and big motorized boats do not go to drydocking for cleaning up their oil tanks and other repairs. They do so in the open sea, which leads to a large volume of floating oil come to the coast and beaches, depending on the sea currents. This must be stopped, and perhaps the Indian Coast Guard can help in monitoring such activities.'' ``This is a serious environmental concern; the oil is either being dumped or the oil vessels are being carelessly washed at sea, which has resulted in the beaches getting tainted with black oil. This is also bound to affect marine life. Even during a recent mangrove cleaning volunteer work, we came across oil, besides other urban rubbish like plastic bottles, straws, slippers and even a mattress dumped there,'' remarked B N Kumar of NatConnect Foundation. Kumar has asked the BNHS researchers to look into this oil on beaches issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/maharashtra-activists-highlight-oil-tar-pollution-at-raigads-beaches/articleshow/86519834.cms||---

Senior police officials said that there is no nearby location for people coming to these offices to park their vehicles. The parking facility like the one at the Kalidas Auditorium is at a little distance. After the deployment of towing vans, the city traffic police has intensified its action on the smart road given the huge number of vehicles parked on road and the footpath. The police said that their main action was focused on the stretch between Central Bus Stand (CBS) Signal and Ashok Stambh. The chaos on the road has become more severe after the district collectorate and other government establishments along the road started operating full fledged. ACP Seetaram Gaikwad of the city traffic branch said, “There is a ground of Zilla Parishad in the front of the district collectorate. Attempts are being made to see if the ground can be used for vehicle parking.” The smart road extends from Trimbak Naka to Ashok Stambh and has been developed aesthetically. Police said they would continue to take action against erring motorists.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/no-letup-in-traffic-congestion-on-nashiks-smart-road/articleshow/86514034.cms||---

The minister on Friday inaugurated the state’s first caravan, a state-of-the-art vehicle, with a LED TV, a sofa, a washroom, GPS and a small kitchen complete with a microwave and a coffee maker. If the initiative performs well, the department will invest in more such luxury road-trip vehicles. Maharaj said the idea was to let people enjoy luxury travel with friends and family and camp at lesser-known locations while having all facilities of a home. The booking format and charges will soon be announced by the department. The tourism minister said the caravan project would also open up opportunities for self-employment for locals. A “Caravan Investor Promotion Cell” has been created by the tourism department, through which locals can purchase a caravan. This opportunity will be made available under the MSME ministry and the tourism department. For this, the government is also offering fixed grants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/caravan-tourism-to-start-in-ukhand-tourists-can-travel-to-lesser-known-spots-while-avoiding-crowds/articleshow/86516035.cms||Kautilya Singh

Currently, based on the availability of the Covid vaccines, the vaccination facilities either run on alternate days of the week or on limited number of days every week. Therefore, the people in the rural areas are aware of the days when the vaccine is more likely to be available at the centre and plan their visits accordingly. Besides, the vaccination is limited to 100 per day in each vaccination centres. Due to this, there are a lot of people who have to go back without taking the vaccine. Ganesh Misal, the deputy collector and nodal officer for vaccination, said the district administration had decided to set up some permanent vaccination centres, where the vaccine doses will be available during all six days without any break. “Every taluka will have at least three such centres, where the vaccine doses will be available all week. Initially, there could be 50 such centres. This will ensure steady vaccination in the rural areas,” said Misal. “Earlier, more than 400 people would queue up outside the centres where 100 doses were available. Now the number in the queue has reduced by 50 % as people know they could get the vaccine the next day,” he said. The officer also added that vaccine centres would now be asked to vaccinate 200 or 300 people instead of 100 so that a better pace of vaccination is achieved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/admin-to-set-up-permanent-vaccine-facilities-in-nashik/articleshow/86514240.cms||Abhilash Botekar

The owner of the jewellery store has registered a complaint in this regard with the Ambad police station. The police have procured footage from the CCTV camera installed near the shop. In the footage, a man wearing a raincoat with his face covered by a mask is seen escaping from the crime scene after putting the bag inside his raincoat. The burglary took place at around 10.30 am on Friday. The jeweller came to his shop with a bag containing gold articles worth Rs 5.65 lakh and cash worth Rs 10,000. The Ambad police said that small-time jewellers generally take the jewellery home and bring it back the next day. The complainant had also done the same. He reached the shop at around 10.30 am and kept the bag inside the store. Minutes later, he asked a neighbouring store owner to keep a watch on his store and went behind the building to fill a water bottle. However, the store owner next to the jewellery shop went inside the shop for some work. At the same time, a burglar went into the complainant’s store, picked up the bag belonging to the jeweller, put it in his raincoat and went outside. Inspector Srikant Nimbalkar, who is investigating the case, said that when the jeweller went to bring water, he met a man, who was seeking help with an address.

---||Goa||To avoid agitation, Goa may put off IIT land call till polls||PANAJI: To avoid any controversy ahead of the upcoming assembly elections, the state government is unlikely to take any decision on finalising land for the IIT campus in Goa. The institute is currently functioning from Farmagudi. Almost nine months ago, the state government took the decision to scrap the IIT-Goa project at Melauli. It then constituted a committee to finalise land to set up the campus, but not much progress has been made to identify land. A senior official said that the government is not in a hurry to finalise the land for IIT-Goa during the election year, and may wait till the elections are over. “The new government may have to take the decision to finalise the land to set up IIT-Goa,” he said. Another official said, “Even in Melauli, they should have asked for compensation. This project will lift them to a much higher level of economic development. No one wants the IIT-Goa campus in their locality, and that is a surprise,” he said. A little over two months ago, CM Pramod Sawant said that the state government would soon announce the place where the IIT-Goa campus would be set up. He had said there isn’t space at Tuem, Pernem, to set up the institute. “The state government is identifying the land for setting up IIT-Goa,” he had said. In January, Sawant acceded to the demand of Melauli locals to shift the project from their village. “The decision to shift the project was taken keeping in mind people’s sentiments and the request of health minister Vishwajit Rane, who is also the local MLA, and local representatives,” Sawant had said. The government’s move to cancel the project at Melauli was the culmination of a six-month-long agitation by residents. The government had earlier identified sites at Canacona and Sanguem for the institute. Power minister and Curchorem MLA Nilesh Cabral had said that his constituents “welcome” the project. The government may now look for sites at Dharbandora, Sanguem or Quepem to set up the institute.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/to-avoid-agitation-state-may-put-off-iit-land-call-till-polls/articleshow/86519831.cms||Murari Shetye

On Thursday, when a mountaineering team of the Indian Army was on its way down from an expedition, it found a body lying frozen — dressed in fatigues, with mountaineering equipment scattered all around. A soldier had gone missing there during a similar expedition 16 years ago. Sources told TOI on Saturday that the soldier who had gone missing then was Anish Tyagi from Ghaziabad in UP. Whether it is the same person whose body has been found has not been confirmed yet. But it is likely. “The body has been sent to the district hospital, Uttarkashi, for an autopsy. After that is done, we will send the samples for DNA analysis. We are trying to trace the soldier’s family,” Uttarkashi SP Manikant Mishra said. An Army officer added, “Once the identity is confirmed, we will hand over the body to the family with all due military honours." The body has been sent to the district hospital, Uttarkashi, for an autopsyIn 2005, an Army mountaineering team was on an expedition to scale Satopanth, the second highest peak in the Gangotri National Park. When the team was on its way back, one of them slipped and went tumbling down. “The soldier went missing,” said the Army officer, who didn’t want to be named. A search operation was launched but the jawan could not be found. The search was eventually called off. “On September 16, an Army mountaineering team from Harsil started on an expedition to Satopanth to commemorate the Swarnim Vijay Varsh celebrations (marking 50 years of the Bangladesh Liberation War). While coming back, they came across a mountaineer’s body,” the Army officer said. Given the amount of time that had passed, it was unrecognisable. “But the body was in uniform and the mountaineering toolkit was found as well. We assume those were the mortal remains of a soldier who went missing during a mountaineering expedition in 2005. After so many years, the family may finally get closure,” the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/16-yrs-after-jawan-went-missing-army-climbing-team-may-have-found-body/articleshow/86515999.cms||Abhyudaya Kotnala

The New Town Forum & News, an umbrella body of housing societies in the township, has fixed a meeting with Rajarhat-New Town MLA Tapas Chatterjee on Monday to discuss the waterlogging issue. On Saturday morning, New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) workers sprayed larvicide inside complexes like Shukhobrishti, Elita Garden Vista, DLF, New Town Heights and others in Action Area 3 where most parts are still under water. On Saturday, more pumps were deployed to drain out water. On Friday, the PHE department had issued an advisory for residents to boil filter water before drinking till the contaminated underground reservoirs are declared safe for storage of water. “Dirty water from the canal has been stagnating in these complexes for almost a week, which is enough for mosquitoes to breed. The residents staying in these housings are in danger of contracting dengue and other water-borne diseases. While we are trying to pump out water, it had become necessary to spray larvicide to kill mosquitoes to prevent a dengue outbreak,” said an NKDA official. NKDA officials also said a team of doctors at the urban health centres had been asked to stock preventive medicines to combat any outbreak. On Friday, many residents of Shukhobrishti, the biggest housing complex in New Town, along with others protested in front of the Hidco’s headquarter in New Town. “We were assured that larvicide will be sprayed and water tested for contamination. Once the water recedes, they will apply bleaching powder and spray carbolic acid to prevent snake infestation,” said Mainak Kanrar, joint secretary of the residents’ association of Shukhobrishti. “Several residents have shifted elsewhere for the fear of diseases and unavailability of drinking water. But others do not have such options,” said Prakash Duggar, a resident of New Town Heights. The authorities have already assured the residents that at least one lift in every tower will be made functional. On Thursday, the residents in the area were informed that the power connection will be turned off but the idea was dropped amidst protests from residents. On Saturday, PHE officials collected water samples from various complexes and buildings in New Town to test in their laboratory.

Forecast of heavy rain has left fishermen worried and they have started securing their bheris with nets and bamboo barricades. “Fish and prawn worth several crores have been damaged or have spilled out of our bheris in the last week and we have no way of recovering this loss. We are also watching viral videos of New Town residents gleefully cheering while catching fish on the road. But who is going to pay for our loss?” asked Mirza Hasan, a fisherman from Machhibhanga village in Bhangar block behind New Town. Across several villages surrounding New Town, like Machhibhanga, Khamuria, Pachuria, Kulberia, Bamunghata, Kulipara, Sardarpara under Bhangar II and Chandpur divisions of Rajarhat and Bhangar blocks, fishery is the primary profession of more than 20,000 families. Apart from prawn, fish like rohu, carp (katla), labeo bata and mrigal carp are cultivated in these bheris. “It pains us when we see our months of labour going to waste. Fish have a habit of swimming against the tide. During this monsoon, water from Bidyadhari river has entered our bheris, breaching embankments and fish have swam into the river, slipping into canals like Bagjola. When water from the canal overflowed, they were all over the lanes and bylanes of New Town,” said Hossein Ali Molla, a fisherman from Kulipara. Piu Mondal, a New Town resident whose video of fishing in a lane beside Uniworld City got 1,54,000 views and 4,200 shares in the last three days, said she had never seen such a scene in New Town. But she added her heart goes out to the poor fishermen who incurred losses. “I was out on a bike with my brother last Tuesday when we first saw hundreds of fish wriggling in the waterlogged stretch as the bike headlight fell on the water. I called my uncle, who brought a fishing net from an acquaintance and we fished from 10pm to 1.40am. We caught a 5kg carp along with other fish weighing more than 11kg. We had some and distributed the rest among friends and family members,” said Mondal, a homemaker.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Vegetable prices shoot through the roof as rain damages crops||KOLKATA: After a brief respite, vegetable prices are on an upswing across retail markets again with a yawning demand-supply gap due to a massive damage to standing crops caused by rain. On Friday, most vegetable prices shot up by Rs 20-Rs 30 a kg compared to what they were at the beginning of the week, when the supply line was still robust despite heavy rain. “The supply was being largely sustained by harvested crops. But after the torrential rain, crops in south Bengal have been damaged, creating a supply line issue,” said Kamal De, president of the Bengal Vendors’ Association. The supply could be hit further if the rain continued, said traders. “Most of the farmers are making distress sale of their produce from the fields. Some of these are being brought to the city and are being sold at a premium, “ added De. “Prices of vegetables have gone up again. The price of LPG is at an all-time high. Prices of mustard oil and spices have kept soaring without an interruption. The kitchen budget is literally on fire. Coming to the market is no more a pleasure but a nightmare. We inevitably burn a big hole in our pockets, “ said Anirban Guha, a private insurance company employee. “The quality of the produce is not really good as some of the vegetables hitting the markets were retrieved from inundated fields. They cannot be stored for long,” said Tarun Das, a retailer at Jadubabur Bazar. “Vegetables like parwal (pointed gourd), which was selling at Rs 35-Rs 40 a kg, is now selling at Rs 70,” said Gour Saha, a wholesaler at Kidderpore market. “Bitter gourd, which was selling at Rs 40 a kg, is now selling at Rs 60,” he added. “A vast stretch of farm fields across Baruipur, Canning, Bongaon, Basirhat, Arambag and Dankuni — from where we get the supply of vegetables to our wholesale and retail markets — are still under water and vegetables are rotting in the field. “The unusually heavy rain in a very short span of time took a huge toll of standing crops,” said Gautam Sinha, a wholesaler at Jinjira bazar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/veggie-prices-shoot-through-the-roof-as-rain-damages-crops/articleshow/86516062.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

The accused also used to sexually abuse his seven-year-old nephew, the Hudkeshwar police said. The complainant saw her younger son forcing himself upon his minor daughter when she returned home from work on Friday. The man’s nephew, who was present there, stood trembling in as he feared his turn would be next. Police sources said the man did not stop violating his daughter even after noticing his mother entering the house and raising an alarm. According to sources, the accused had been exploiting his nephew for many days and performed unnatural sex. “The man started raping his daughter in the second week of September. He would exploit both the boy and girl in turns,” said a cop. The woman rushed to the police station with her minor granddaughter. The cops nabbed the accused from his home on Friday evening. On Saturday, the police presented the minors before the child welfare committee and government counsellors to help them cope with the trauma. The mother of the accused told cops that her “pervert” son’s wife left him seven years ago. The family also held the accused responsible for his elder brother’s wife leaving the house. The accused, who has criminal cases like assault and theft registered against him, used to pose as a transgender to beg on the streets, the police said. Senior inspector Sarthak Nehete of Hudkeshwar police station said that the accused was produced before the court on Saturday which remanded him in police custody for four days. District child protection officer Mushtak Pathan said that he would now meet the minors and counsel them.

Cost for the construction of ROB is estimated at Rs 13.79 crore and it has been sanctioned on a cost-sharing basis with Government of Karnataka. The ROB construction is is expeced to be completed by December 2022. Joshi had inaugurated the re-development works at Dharwad railway station in 2018, but there was no progress in the construction of the ROB. The railway gate connects Kalyan Nagar, Danu Nagar, Attikolla and Ramnagar to Malamaddi and station road and thousands of people and vehicles pass through this gate every day. There was a long pending demand from the public for the construction of the ROB as frequent closure of the railway gate was causing great inconvenience to the people moving towards and from Kalyan Nagar. In 2017, the railway ministry had announced in the budget allocation of funds for construction of over bridge/underpass near Kalyan Nagar railway gate with a rider that the local body or the state government must contribute 50% of the cost. In June 2018, Dharwad railway station was chosen for another round of development. It was among the 68 stations in the country chosen for renovation. However, the Congress-JD(S) coalition government remained indifferent towards the proposal and the share of state government was not released.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/work-on-kalyan-nagar-rob-to-commence-soon/articleshow/86517050.cms||GURURAJ JAMKHANDI

Many other Indian cities have lined up to get into the pledge. New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) chairman and MD Debasish Sen said: “New Town is already a certified green city and a solar city which produces 1.3 megawatt of peak solar power. We are encouraging e-vehicles, with adequate charging infrastructure. Getting into compact energy movement will help us set a benchmark to go for and exceed.” All households and institutions are connected to grid-based stable electric power supply. Principle plot of land are handed over only after ensuring power connection from the grid. This has started from the inception of the city. The city is still under growth phase with a design population of 1 million residents and half a million floating population. New Town is a growing planned city where people are migrating in and new habitations are being built. Energy demand is increasing with increasing population. New Town is a solar city under the solar city mission of the central government with an installed capacity of 1,252 KWp solar power plants.

According to jail officials, the three undertrials Prakash Rajput, Chirag Pandya and Krunal Solanki, who are lodged in yard 12 of the jail, misbehaved with jail staff on Friday noon when they were asked to get back inside their barracks. The inmates are allowed outside their barracks between 8 am and noon. On Friday around noon, when jail sepoys went to lock the inmates up in their barracks, the trio hurled abuses at them. When the sepoys forced them to go inside their barracks, the inmates got into a brawl with the staff during which the sepoys’ uniforms were torn. Later, Pandya instigated Rajput and dashed his head with iron frames of the barrack. Rajput was then asked to get himself admitted to the hospital. He alleged that jail staff beat him up. Due to the melee, other inmates of the jail also gathered around risking the security of the premises. However, other jail sepoys rushed to yard 12 and the situation was brought under control. Even while Rajput was being taken away, he threatened a jail sepoy. All three prisoners were booked for hurting public servant, assault, using obscene words and criminal intimidation at Raopura police station on Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/inmates-assault-sepoys-after-brawl-booked/articleshow/86515362.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Prayagraj: Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad may meet to name Mahant Narendra Giri successor before ‘shodashi’||PRAYAGRAJ: The 16th day death ritual or “Shodashi” of Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad (ABAP) chief Mahant Narendra Giri will take place at his Baghambari Gaddi Math on October 5. A meeting of the ABAP, the apex decision-making body of the 13 recognised Hindu monastic orders of the country, could also be held in the Math a day or two before the Shodashi to discuss the successor of the Mahant to head ABAP. However, the exact date of this vital meeting will be finalised soon. Following the suicide by Mahant Narendra Giri, the ABAP chief’s post is lying vacant and ABAP has the challenge of finding the reasons behind the Mahant’s death and appointing a new chief of this powerful body on priority. “The general consensus among the representatives of the 13 monastic orders is that the meeting of the ABAP be held on October 3 or October 5, just before the 16th-day rituals of the Mahant,” said a senior seer of the math, privy to the discussions being held in this regard. Though ABAP’s meetings in Prayagraj usually have been held at Baghamabi Math premises for the past many years, the next meeting will not be taking place here as most seers believe that no such event should be held in the Math before the rituals of Shodashi. So, the next meeting of ABAP could be held either at Shri Panchayati Akhada’s Manahirwani ashram at Daraganj or Shri Panchayati Udaseen Akhada premises at Kydganj, the seer shared. ABAP’s general secretary and patron of Juna Akhada Swami Hari Giri said, “Plans are afoot to hold a meeting of ABAP before the ‘Shodashi’ rituals of Mahant Narendra Giri. Many important points were up for discussion during it.” Mahant Narendra Giri was elected to the post of ABAP president in 2014 soon after the successful Kumbh-2013 on the banks of Sangam. It was during his tenure as the Akhada Parishad chief that the Kumbh-2019 was held in a grand manner and which saw Narendra Giri being re-elected to the post in October 2019 during a meeting held in Haridwar. Following the untimely demise of the Mahant, most saints want a new ABAP chief to be elected on priority as preparations for Kumbh-2025 needs to start at least 2-3 years in advance. The senior saints at the ABAP meeting would need to take a call as to whether to appoint a new ABAP chief from Prayagraj itself, that is to host the Kumbh-2025 or go for a saint from some other district or state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/abap-could-meet-to-decide-girissuccessor-before-his-shodashi/articleshow/86516116.cms||Rajeev Mani

The American studies released by Centers for Diseases Control (CDC) in Atlanta underline how masks protected children from coronavirus, even against the highly transmissible Delta variant. One study, conducted in Arizona state, found schools that did not require staff and students to wear masks were 3.5 times as likely to have a virus outbreak as schools that required masking. A second study looked at infections among children in 520 counties across the United States, and found that once the public school year started, pediatric cases increased at a far higher rate in counties where schools did not require masks. A ‘New York Times’ report said that between the week before school started and the second week of school, the number of pediatric infections increased by 35 cases per 100,000 in counties without mask requirements, while the number increased by 16 cases per 100,000 population in counties with school mask requirements. Incidentally, the US registered the highest weekly increase in pediatric cases last week, when 2.52 lakh children were detected with Covid. Experts said such an increase is mainly due to Delta variant. In Maharashtra, the state government’s pediatric task force on Covid-19 has made masks mandatory at schools. While children can wear cloth masks, schools have to stock up masks in case a child loses, dirties or wets his/her mask. “A cloth mask is good enough, but we have advised schools to organise meetings with parents to discuss such issues,”' said task force member Dr Vijay Yewale. Sero surveys conducted in Mumbai have shown that over 50% of the children have antibodies against the virus. In August, the task force submitted guidelines to be followed before schools restart. One of the main requirements was for all staff, including teachers, to be fully vaccinated and ensure enough ventilation in classrooms. “Many municipal and district schools don’t have fans to ensure rooms are airy. If need be, civil work may be needed to provide better ventilation in congested classrooms,” said a doctor with a government hospital. The task force also asked for classrooms to be cleaned before schools restart to remove dirt and fungal growth. “Air-conditioners and lifts cannot be used. Contact sports should be avoided and hand sanitisers should be provided,” said Dr Yewale. Provisions should be made to check the temperature of all students before entering school.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-2-us-studies-on-masks-at-schools-should-allay-parents-fears-in-state/articleshow/86519947.cms||---
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu plans to take schools to students of Classes I to VIII||CHENNAI: The uncertainty over reopening schools for younger classes remains and the government plans to take schools to places near students and involve local volunteers to ensure everyone has foundational numeracy and literacy skills. Schools reopened for Classes IX to XII on September 1, but no decision has been taken on reopening for Classes I to VIII. To address concern among parents, the school education department plans a statewide campaign to mitigate the learning loss and to ensure basic literacy among children of Classes I to VIII, sources said. Teachers and educational volunteers will go to areas where students live and engage them in activities and conduct classes for one to two hours a day till schools reopen. It will be modelled on the ‘Veethi Vagupparai’ (Classes on the Streets) method followed by a NGO. The campaign is likely to be linked with the government’s ‘Ennum Ezhuthum’ mission to ensure children are able to comprehend and possess basic arithmetic skills by the time they are eight years old. The school education department on Saturday held the second meeting with 10 non-governmental organisations including Tamil Nadu Science Forum (TNSF), Palli Kalvi Pathukappu Iyakkam, Forum for Child Friendly Schools and Aid India. “The department plans to standardize resource material used by various NGOs. It is studying the pros and cons of taking classes to nearby hamlets till the reopening of schools,” one participant said. Aruna Rathnam, a former education specialist with Unicef, said it was good the government was aware of parents’ anxiety about learning loss and wants to address it. Involving volunteers would help as teachers may not be able cover the multiple hamlets, she addded. N Madhavan, state executive committee member of TNSF, said the learning loss cannot be compensated only by teachers and schools. “The community needs to take part in the process of compensating the loss, and giving emotional, psychological support to the children. The Tamil Nadu government understood it and has initiated discussions,” he said. TNSF possesses the expertise of successfully running “Arivoli Iyakkam”, a total literacy campaign launched in the early 1990s across the state. “If it is finalized, it can set an example for the rest of the country.” The representatives of NGOs also suggested that the government make the campaign an agenda for the Grama Sabha meetings scheduled to be held on October 2.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tn-plans-to-take-schools-to-students-of-classes-i-to-viii/articleshow/86516128.cms||---

---||Mumbai||No change in Covid vaccination gap, interval working well, says NTAGI chief||PUNE: Dr N K Arora, chairman, Covid-19 working group of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI), on Saturday ruled out any changes in the gap between two doses of Covishield, citing scientific studies suggesting the vaccine’s higher efficacy when the interval between the shots was longer. “Any further changes would be based only on scientific evidence and not on random demands,” Arora told TOI on Saturday, stressing that the current interval had been working well. Several states, including Kerala, Karnataka and Maharashtra, are keen to reduce the gap between the two doses of Covishield from the current 84 days. Arora said data from the vaccine tracker platform indicated that the way the Covishield doses were currently being administered was fine. Therefore, there was no need to change it as of now, he said, adding that the vaccine’s effectiveness in the current interval was being monitored constantly. Virologist T Jacob John differed a bit. He told TOI the Covishield doses’ gap could be reduced to four weeks for individuals at high risk and senior citizens. “They (authorities) should at least think about it,” he said. Explaining his thought, the retired professor and the head of department of clinical virology and microbiology of Christian Medical College (Vellore) said, “If someone wants early immunity, give the second dose at four weeks. But if you want the maximum possible immunity, wait for 84 days. Two doses save lives. So, for individuals at high risk of severe disease and death, four weeks’ interval is the best. For them, protection delayed could mean protection denied. For all others between 18 and 60 years, the 84-day interval is logical.” Dr Anish T S, associate professor at Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram, also said a shorter gap could be considered for vulnerable groups such as senior citizens and people with comorbidities. “The effectiveness of a single dose may not be sufficient to protect them from clinically severe diseases in the context of the Delta variant,” he said. Dr M K Sudarshan, chairman of the Karnataka government Covid-19 technical advisory committee, told TOI they had recommended that the Karnataka health minister reduce the time gap of Covishield doses to about six weeks because there were sufficient vaccines but not enough second dose takers. “There is enough scientific evidence that one to two months’ gap is efficacious,” he said. Dr Rajeev Jayadevan, member, National Indian Medical Task Force on Corona Epidemic, told TOI a longer gap was better for long-term protection. “At present, it is best to have a longer gap to protect people from severe disease,” he added. ‘No vax for children before schools open; parents, teachers need jabs’There was no need to vaccinate children for reopening schools, said NTAGI task force chairman Dr N K Arora on Saturday. “What is important is to vaccinate parents, teachers and school staffers before the resumption of physical classes,” he said. Vaccination of healthy children would commence next year, but the immunization of kids with comorbidities would start next month, Dr Arora said. He said they were finalising the list of comorbidities in this age group and it would be ready in the next 8-10 days. Virologist Dr T Jacob John said the priority of vaccination for children was not high and schools should reopen before the immunisation programme was rolled out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-no-change-in-vax-gap-interval-working-well-says-ntagi-chief/articleshow/86519982.cms||Nisha Nambiar

She also stated that she did not remember some details pertaining to injured police personnel and admitted that she had not independently verified certain things pertaining to the investigation in the alleged encounter killings. Deposing before the SC-appointed commission for the second consecutive day, Apoorva Rao stated that only the last paragraph in her case diary on December 9, 2019, was after her visit to the alleged encounter site at Chattanpally and rest of the content was from the case diary of IO Surender Reddy. Rao also stated that she did not record in her case diary about examining the two police personnel, K Venkateshwarulu and Aravind Goud, at the hospital on December 9, 2019 as she did not think it was necessary at that time and also that she did not remember whether they were in independent rooms or the same room. Referring to her case diary, the commission’s advocate K Parameshwar asked how she reached a conclusion that Disha case accused, Md Arif, had fired eight rounds and C Chennakeshavulu fired seven rounds from the weapons they reportedly snatched from police personnel and during the subsequent related deposition, Apoorva Rao stated that she relied on the information from IO J Surender Reddy and the witness statements of two cops whose weapons were allegedly snatched, recorded before the formation of SIT. Rao was asked why SIT did not seize the arms and ammunition register despite a categorical direction from the high court on December 21, 2019. She stated, “I can not say.”She said that the four deceased’s clothes were handed over to police by doctors, who conducted post-mortem examination, and it was incorrectly stated in the case diary recorded on December 8, 2019, that they were seized during inquest conducted at the scene of firing on December 6. Rao also admitted that she did not examine the executive magistrates, who had examined the witnesses in relation to the alleged encounter killings case.  Shamshabad DCP Prakash Reddy told the SC-appointed panel that he had rented a safe house only once after looking at three private guest houses on the requisition of ACP V Surender, keeping in view of mob surrounding the Shadnagar PS after the arrest of the accused, and he did not know if it was a regular practice in Telangana to engage a private guest house as a safe house||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sp-admits-case-diary-content-was-lifted-from-ios-record/articleshow/86518065.cms||---

K Ashok Kumar, a BA graduate from Madurai, says he found that water bottles thrown on the roadsides and open places constituted a large portion of garbage and decided to do something about it. “Plastic is an environmental hazard which is here to stay. But we should do our bit and recycle it as much as possible,” says he. He collects empty water bottles from the roadside and fills them with some soil. Simultaneously, he also picks herbs or medicinal plants growing on the side of pavements and roads and plants them in these bottles. ``I maintain the small plants for about fifteen days and when they establish roots and show signs of growing, I give them to people who ask for them free of cost,’’ he said. He has found plants like oregano, tulsi, Solanum Trilobatum, veldt grape and other herbs. Around twenty people have come to him for the plants so far in one month as word spread about his noble cause. “I also collect saplings of larger plants and grow them in the cans, and plan to plant them near water bodies,’’ he said. Among the plants that he collects, there is high demand for tulsi. He has only one request to the people who take the plants: Replant them and send the plastic bottle for proper recycling without disposing it in garbage. “This is a tiny step, but even if I collect only 30 bottles and reuse them, it means I am dealing with a minute portion of environmental degradation, which gives me immense pleasure,’’ he said. Ashok Kumar also makes toys out of palmyra seeds and gives them to children with a request to the parents to plant it by the roadside or near a waterbody when their child gets tired of the toy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/a-green-way-to-tackle-plastic-menace/articleshow/86518095.cms||---

A facility for pilgrims will also be established in Madurai at a cost of Rs 35 crore, he addedSpeaking to reporters after inspecting the mandapam and the renovated and developed ‘Othuvar Palli’ in the temple, the minister said that six students had been selected for undergoing training in this ‘Othuvar’ school which was already functioning on the temple premises. “The mandapam would be renovated with the help of the Tamil Nadu state archaeology department to ensure that the originality is maintained. Public opinion was also being sought on conducting the consecration of the Meenakshi temple as there is a belief that it should not be held when the mandapam was damaged within it,” Babu said.Gold donated to temples across the state in the last nine years, which are lying under-utilized would be converted into biscuits and maintained in fixed deposit accounts of the temples from where they were obtained, the minister said. He also charged the previous AIADMK government for introducing the now suspended rope cars in Sholinganallur and Iyermalai without completing the work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/veeravasantharayar-mandapam-work-will-be-over-in-3-yrs-min/articleshow/86518154.cms||---

The minor was locked inside a house by her 'friend' and raped by the latter's boyfriend on March 24, 2017. The convicted duo also filmed the assault and used it to rape her for the next six months. The girl went into severe depression and stopped going to school. Her family came to know of it in September and an FIR was filed under IPC sections 376 (rape), 506 (criminal intimidation), 120-B (criminal conspiracy) along with sections of the Pocso Act and the SC/ST Act. The court also slapped a fine of Rs 55,000 on them. Divulging details, additional district government counsel Reetram Rajput said, “The FIR was registered by the survivor's grandfather who said that she was repeatedly raped. During the investigation, police found direct evidence against the woman and her boyfriend who used to work at a nursing home and filed a charge-sheet against the two." The survivor told the court that she knew the woman as she belonged to the same locality. The other accused used to stalk her and she had complained against his behaviour in the past. On March 24, the woman took the girl to her rented home “to have tea with her”. There, she found the same man who used to stalk her. She tried to get out, but the woman locked her in and allowed the stalker to rape her. They filmed the assault, the survivor had said. “On the basis of evidence, special judge Ram Dayal found both of them guilty of rape and criminal conspiracy and sentenced them for life. They are now lodged in jail and a copy of the judgment along with the warrant will be sent there," Rajput added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/man-girl-friend-get-life-term-in-dalit-girl-rape-case/articleshow/86521720.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

---||Nashik||Private tutorials too seek nod to reopen||Nashik: The Nashik city private tutorial association has petitioned the district administration to allow its members to reopen their centres at the earliest. Due to the Covid restrictions, more than 2,000 professional tutors in the district had to keep their classes shut for over one-and-a-half years. Now that the government has allowed schools in urban areas to reopen, the tutors too are seeing light at the end of the tunnel. “This has been a dark phase in the lives of the tutors who professionally teach children and earn their living. We hope the district administration will take a decision after considering our situation,” said Jayant Mule, the president of the Private Coaching Classes Directors Association. Muley convened a meeting of the association at Hutatma Smarak on Saturday, submitting a memorandum to the district administration. The association hopes that the district collector will issue orders to allow the conduct of coaching classes — much like the schools have been allowed. “The association does not include the tutors of small classes with less than 10 students. The tutors are in distress as they are unable to repay the loans on their properties and even pay for the higher education of their children. Our request to the government, through the administration, is to allow the physical assembly of students for coaching classes as well,” said Muley. Muley also pointed out that the association had promised to adhere to all the Covid-norms — RT-PCR testing of teachers, sanitation and hygiene norms, limiting the numbers of students etc. — during the functioning of the coaching classes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/private-tutorials-too-seek-nod-to-reopen/articleshow/86514290.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Madurai||Now, patients’ vitals can be remotely monitored||Madurai: An advanced wireless biosensor patch to help doctors keep track of vital signs of patients remotely was unveiled at the Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) on Saturday.State finance minister P T R Palanivel Thiagarajan, who unveiled the biosensor patch, said; “Technology can be effectively used to remove inefficiencies of human beings. This system allows for 24x7 monitoring of patients’ vitals with accuracy that is more than what is humanly possible. It is important for such advanced technology to be implemented in government hospitals where it reaches the poorest of the poor.” The minister added that Madurai district was able to tackle Covid-19 better since crowding of hospitals was prevented and treatment was diversified by making use of health infrastructure in rural areas as well effectively. He hoped that such technology will help doctors serve patients better especially during the pandemic.Dr M Natarajan, head, department of General Medicine, said that the remote monitoring system is particularly helpful in case of Covid-19 patients and patients in intensive care units (ICUs) as it lessens exposure. “The patient’s vitals, including temperature, pulse, oxygen saturation level etc., can be monitored by the biosensor patch placed on the patient. Doctors will also be monitoring the patient as usual. But remotely, the patient can be monitored 24x7 this way. Further, in case of any changes in vitals that indicate worsening of patient, an alarm also goes off. However, the alarm is only for the doctors as it helps avoid the patient go into panic,” he added.The system was donated by LifeSigns and already 120 biosensor patches are under trial at the GRH. “GRH stands foremost in the state in adopting advanced technology for patient care. The trial has found the system to be quite effective. A total of 1,000 biosensor patches are to be provided to GRH,” said Dr A Rathinavel, dean, GRH.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/now-patients-vitals-can-be-remotely-monitored/articleshow/86518237.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Road repair work to suffer as funds crunch hits LMC||LUCKNOW: Bearing the brunt of dilapidated and pothole-ridden roads for the past one year, the people of Lucknow will have to continue to suffer for at least two more months. Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) is once again facing a financial crunch and the civic body’s plans to generate funds for repair works has hit a roadblock. Though officials assure that the matter will be sorted out soon, it will take at least a month to start the work and another 45-60 days to complete patchwork and renovation of damaged roads. About 3,000km of road network in the city is under LMC’s jurisdiction. According to the civic body’s own records, repair of around 1,200km road network has been done in the past year and maintenance of the remaining was put in abeyance due to revenue losses during the pandemic. After chief minister Yogi Adityanath recently directed all civic agencies in UP to repair streets in their jurisdiction within a month, LMC decided to take out money from corporators’ ward development fund and use the 15th Finance Commission grant for road repair work. However, corporators opposed the move saying that the decision to take out money from ward development funds was taken without their consent. Now, mayor Sanyukta Bhatia has asked officers to take corporators into confidence and announced to give Rs 5 crore from the mayor’s contingency fund. “We had earmarked Rs 80 crore in LMC’s annual budget for maintenance of roads, but due to the ongoing pandemic, our revenue remained low this year, hence the required renovation work could not be carried out,” said municipal commissioner Ajay Dwivedi. “Subsequently, we decided to take out Rs 22 crore from the corporators’ ward development fund for patchwork of broken roads in inner residential colonies and utilise a Rs 50-crore grant from the 15th Finance Commission to renovate main city stretches,” he added. There are 110 wards and each corporator representing them gets about Rs 1.2 crore per annum for local development work.

Apart from a team of psychologists that has been counselling children who have lost both parents to Covid, Arpan--an NGO working with victims of child sexual abuse--has recently tied up with Women and Child Development Department (WCD) to extend telephonic counselling to over 2500 children who have lost a single parent. Together, their experiences offer a poignant peek into the aftermath of sudden loss. "Am I doing the right thing? Should I just tell him and get it over with?" a mother to a six-year-old often asks psychiatrist Dr Avinash De Sousa. When her 37-year-old husband died due to Covid-19 last month, she told her son that his father had gone off to London for a few months. The beautiful lie means that there is no garlanded photo of her husband in the house and that the widowed mother must stifle her sobs in front of the son. De Sousa, who has come across other surviving parents who have not disclosed the death to their little ones over the last year, states how Covid-19 has "complicated grief" by robbing the bereaved of a decent farewell, the ability to hug the departed and the many shoulders of people offering emotional support at funerals. "Losing a parent is the biggest grief a child can ever experience," says psychotherapist Anupriya Das, who handholds Arpan's counsellors as they help each child navigate the five stages of grief--denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. For these counsellors, who have been speaking to children in three districts--Mumbai City, Mumbai Suburb and Thane--over the phone since two months now, the process begins with coordinators calling up the surviving parents of the children whose data has been shared by the WCD, understanding the background and procuring consent to proceed with counselling. Once the parent is on board, grief counselling starts. On a recent preliminary assessment call, a woman told the counsellors that her 16-year-old son is deeply affected by the loss of his father (“It's the time for me to get an admission in college, his presence is missed and I feel lost") and the younger child, a seven-yearold, asks everyday about when his father is going to come back. "Each child processes grief differently," says Das, citing a young bereaved daughter who confessed that she did not cry in front of family members as she didn't want them to get stressed. It was on the phone with a counsellor that the girl--whose family members had called her "brave" and "strong"--finally broke down for the first time and confessed that "it felt better". The overarching mandate, says Das, is not to rush the process to closure. "We do not make the child feel compelled to always say something," says Das, adding that counsellors may ask kids to draw a memory with the late parent or to write a letter to the parent. In the bargain, the mental health experts learn how well-intentioned condolences from relatives can be "heart-breaking" for the child. Some kids who were told “your parent is now in a better place”, for instance, have asked therapists if "this place"--referring to their home--was a bad place. While most children know about death from movies and cartoons, "to know of death and to experience the death of a loved one are two very different things. The loss can create a vacuum, leave them confused and anxious," says a therapist even as De Sousa stresses on ascertaining how much children know first. "Some know that their papa had gone to a hospital and than an ambulance had come to pick them up. Some others are in denial and are waiting for the late parent to return," says De Sousa. Economic conditions also influence recovery. Surviving parents often ask Arpan's counsellors about basic needs such as food, medicine, education and rentals. "Counselling is not even a priority for most of them," says Das, adding that the team was pre-emptively trained to apprise the parent of relevant government schemes. Citing five siblings who lost their father during the second wave and now get to attend online school only one day a week as they share one phone between them, Das confesses that getting such families to prioritize their telephonic counselling sessions has been a "very peculiar" timeline-altering challenge for them. However, De Sousa--who has been privy to the inner torments of affluent teens coping with the loss of both parents to Covid-19--insists: "Grief is grief irrespective of culture and background". "I don't like this uncle but I have no option but to stay with him now," some have confessed to him. No matter how robust the therapy, few things can expedite recovery for a child as much as a resilient surviving parent, say Arpan's counsellors who have been sending reports to WCD twice a week. Small victories so far include the 7-year-old, who had been asking his mother about the whereabouts of his late father, telling the counsellors that his elder brother had nowtaken on the role of the late father partially. "He is assisting his sibling in his studies and taking care of him in ways that his father used to," says Das.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/grief-counselling-helps-kids-of-covid-deceased-cope/articleshow/86520083.cms||Sharmila Ganesan Ram

---||Delhi||Freeing up: 9 sites picked in south Delhi to park heavy vehicles at night||NEW DELHI: South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) has identified nine sites for parking of commercial vehicles at night. The move is aimed at avoiding congestion on main roads in south Delhi areas due to haphazard parking of heavy vehicles. These on-street parking sites are located at prominent stretches near commercial or residential areas. To get the traffic police’s permission, SDMC officials held a meeting with the joint CP, traffic police on Friday, said officials. “Since the new parking policy notified by Delhi government stresses on renewal of commercial vehicles’ registration every year only when there is proof of parking, this facility will be required for such vehicles. The civic body can issue parking certificates/NoC that can be utilised by the owner for the registration renewal in future,” said Prem Shankar Jha, deputy commissioner, remunerative and project cell, SDMC. “The traffic police have told us that the matter will be looked into and a reply will be given soon,” said a south corporation official. The civic body aims to charge a minimum of Rs 9,900 per month as parking fee from commercial vehicles and the rate will increase depending upon the size of commercial vehicles. “So far, we have identified space for parking of 134 buses and trucks. More such parking sites will be identified in future,” said the official. Residents of different areas, including Alaknanda and Nivedita Kunj (RK Puram), have been frequently complaining about inconveniences caused to them due to parking of commercial vehicles, such as buses, tempos, trolleys and trucks, on the main roads during night hours. “The project sites after getting finalised will be given to parking contractors. They will install CCTV cameras and make other arrangements for safety purposes,” said the official. Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment, however, said that the term, “commercial vehicles”, was wide and covered many kinds of vehicles, including e-vehicles. It is important to earmark sites for all of these after understanding their requirements and doing proper demarcation. “There are taxi aggregators who need space to park their cars at night. Then we have tempos also, which will need space for loading and unloading. Since all these vehicles will be covered under the Delhi Parking Policy as well as electrical vehicle policy, keeping all factors in mind before finalising sites is very important. Provision for charging stations also needs to be looked into,” she said. The south corporation presently has 140 surface parking lots for non-commercial vehicles and of them, 113 are fully operational. Besides, there are six operational underground multi-level and two stack parking lots.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/freeing-up-9-sites-picked-to-park-heavy-vehicles-at-night/articleshow/86518287.cms||Vibha Sharma

The NMC said cited the rise in population and the floating population of the city to make the demand of 5,600 mcft water from the dams. The department, however, has asked NMC to provide details of population dependent on water sourced from each dam and even the livestock dependent on them. The reservation of water from the dams is done by the Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority (MWRRA). “The MWRRA requires the data of population dependent on the dams. The information sent by the NMC was inadequate and hence more information has been sought from them,” the WRD officer said. It may also be noted that the NMC has placed demand for water for drinking purpose at the rate of 135 litre per capita per day (lpcpd) considering the population of the city is less than 50 lakh. The WRD officials have, however, pointed out that the demand was on the higher side considering the water losses of corporation are 40%, when only 15% losses are allowed. The official also said that information on rain-water harvesting and quantum of water saved through such projects is being sought. The NMC officers said the civic body would comply to the remarks by the WRD before October 15.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/submit-dam-wise-water-use-data-irrigation-dept-to-nmc/articleshow/86514368.cms||---

---||Nashik||Schools prepare to restart in cities, parents divided||NASHIK/ KOLHAPUR/ AURANGABAD: Local education authorities are taking cautious steps towards reopening schools, even as parents are split over the government decision to open schools physically. The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) is thinking of initially reopening some schools, which are located near its urban health centres. NMC sources said it would not be possible for NMC to set up health centres in all its schools by October 4 as per the government decision. The sources from Nashik Zilla Parishad said that since the guidelines were issued late on Friday, a meeting of education and health departments will be held on Monday after which the steps for opening schools would be announced. The private schools in Nashik, however, said they were eager to reopen but would wait for the guidelines from the respective authorities. “The schools staff is vaccinated and covid-appropriate infrastructure is also ready. Most schools also have infirmaries. All depends upon the parents’ consent and the guidelines,” Himgauri Adke, the president of Association of Nashik Schools – association of 35 ICSE and CBSE schools in the city said. In Kolhapur, the municipal corporation has decided to conduct a workshop of the school headmasters or principals to make them aware of the guidelines issued by the state government. As many as 50,718 students study in classes 8-12 in 112 schools in Kolhapur city alone. “We are going to form committees to guide the schools to run classes as per the guidelines. Also, squads will be formed to carry out surprise checks of the schools. All teachers and non-teaching staff is at least partially vaccinated,” said Shankar Yadav, school administrator of KMC. A total of around 361 schools located within municipal limits of Aurangabad are set to restart for classes 8-12. Ramnath Thore, education officer with Aurangabad Municipal Corporation, said the civic administration would issue necessary order by early next week, detailing the SOP for reopening. Regional assistant director of education, B B Chavan said around 2,137 schools from rural areas of Aurangabad have been already operating classes for class 5 and above since September 6. The parents are, however, split over sending the wards to school. Renuka Beedkar, a parent, said the government should have waited till Diwali for schools to resume considering the possibility of the third wave of Covid and rise in cases post the festive season. Sanket Thakre from Nashik, whose daughter is in class 10, feels that she would benefit from the school reopening. “At home, they tend to get lethargic. Meeting friends and classmates will also boost their spirits,” he said. Maharashtra English School Trustees Association (MESTA) has welcomed the decision to reopen schools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/schools-prepare-to-restart-in-cities-parents-divided/articleshow/86514413.cms||---

Following a marked improvement in the Covid-19 situation in the national capital, the Delhi government had last month announced that schools for classes IX to XII, colleges and coaching institutions would reopen from September 1. The Delhi government had clarified that no student would be forced to attend physical classes and the consent of parents would be mandatory. RC Jain, president of the Delhi State Public Schools Management Association, said the government had said they would analyse the situation after reopening of schools for Classes IX-XII and then decide on reopening further. “It has been close to a month but there has been no Covid case reported from any school. Even the positivity rate in the national capital is below 0.1 per cent. “We want that schools should be reopened not only for classes 6-8 but also for primary classes. If there is a change in the current scenario, they can be closed again,” he said. pti||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/parents-want-more-classes-to-reopen/articleshow/86518335.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Coding to stitching, initiative gives wings to job seekers in Mumbai||MUMBAI: Over two dozen people--some bearded, some burqa-clad--queue up near a table which has a couple of volunteers poring over papers. The people desperately need jobs while the papers carry some basic information: name, educational qualification, contact number and so on. The job seekers get quick responses, in some cases even before they have returned home. The jobs which come their way fetch them a minimum salary of Rs 15,000 a month. A paltry sum given the inflation but this too is a big relief for the families surviving on doles. And the service helping them get jobs is free. Welcome to Udaan 505, an initiative by businessman Faisal Hawa and his team at Nagpada in Central Mumbai. From coding skills to stitching and tailoring to bookkeeping, Udaan 505 provides “wings” to those who are willing to “fly”. Actually, it propels action even to many notoriously lethargic souls. “Harkat mein barkat hai (action brings benefits),” Hawa declares. The idea is to motivate, guide and help engage the unemployed in the mainstream workforce.” But why the name Udaan 505? Hawa says he hopes to put at least 50 lakhs in jobs in five years. Having started six years ago, it has helped found around 10,000 jobs in various sectors so far. Ghatkopar resident Abu Salman Qureishi graduated in automobile engineering in 2016. He lost his job soon after the first lockdown last year. “Through a contact, I met Aashna (Khan) madam (she looks after HR at Udaan 505) who helped me join a company where I handle social media and am very happy,” says Qureishi who supports a family of five. Hawa's team hunts for jobs at different portals and matches the requirements from applicants' qualifications. He uses his networks and helps the unemployed get training as computer operators, interns with CAs or learn coding and programming. Jobs in call centres are also offered. What provides the steady flow of the unemployed to Hawa and his team is an NGO-run dispensary at Nagpada which distributes free medicine. Three days a week (Tuesday, Thursday and Friday), the tall, bearded Shahid Maredia, Hawa’s employee, visits the venue. Standing amidst the group of free medicines’ seekers, Maredia loudly announces the opportunities to get jobs. “Those who have cleared SSC and beyond will need to submit their resumes while the school dropouts will need just Aadhar Card’s copy and contact number. We will provide you free computer training while the widows will get help on how to get government’s pension. Those women who know tailoring will get clothes to stitch kurta-pyjama. Each pair will fetch them Rs 150 and we will not give you less than 10 pairs at a time,” announces Maredia and occupies his chair to fill the forms before he rises again to announce after a while. “On an average, we get over 40 applicants from here on each of the three days in a week. Besides, we have around 25 walk ins daily,” informs Khan. Sewri resident Zarina Khatoon has been separated from her husband for the last eight years. She wants help, for herself and her two sons, aged 18 and 16. “You need to submit some documents, including khulanama (a document which says that the woman has given divorce to her husband as he has either deserted her or has been missing) before the procedure for your pension begins,” she is told. Meanwhile, efforts will be made to get her two sons engaged in jobs, the elder immediately and the younger one later. Abida Amjad Syed worked as a ‘patient caretaker’ with a famous politician in the city before the first lockdown rendered her jobless. “My employer said he would not risk my visits to his home daily during the pandemic. I have been jobless for months,” she tells TOI. “We will try to find her work according to her experience,” says Hawa who wants others to gollow cue. He estimates that, if four crore people earn at least Rs 15,000 monthly for five years, over 18 crore people can be lifted out of poverty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-coding-to-stitching-initiative-gives-wings-to-job-seekers/articleshow/86520118.cms||Mohammed Wajihuddin
---||Nashik||Maharashtra: Temples, religious places set to open their doors on first day of Navaratra||KOLHAPUR/NASHIK/PUNE: The government nod to reopening of religious places from October 7 in the state has prompted a flurry of activity to get the shrines ready to welcome the devotees back. In Kolhapur, the famous Mahalaxmi temple is preparing to handle a large number of devotees as October 7 happens to be the first day of the Navratri festival. Accordingly, the temple administration has started the preparations. The shikhars of the temple are being polished, while the carved stone walls are being cleaned by high-pressure water. The two other famous temples of Kolhapur district — Jotiba and Nrusinhwadi Datt — too are preparing to open their doors from October 7. Bhagyashree Banayat, the CEO of the Shri Saibaba Sansthan Trust (SSST), Shirdi, said a meeting of trust officials will be held on September 27 and details on the measures to be taken would be fixed. “The temple management will ensure that devotees are not inconvenienced,” Banayat added. According to some temple officials, matters like issuance of darshan passes to devotees, the maximum number of devotees to be allowed on a daily basis, reopening of the bhakta niwas etc. would be discussed in the forthcoming meeting. When the temple had reopened in November last year, the SSST had made it mandatory for devotees to book darshan passes online. The management of the Trimbakeshwar temple will also ensure that devotees maintain social distancing. “Shri Trimbakeshwar Devasthan Trust is working to set up a system where devotees can procure passes online to visit the temple. Although it would be ready by October 7, we are trying to make this new system operational by the end of next month. This would ensure that people need not stand in queues for passes,” said Prashant Gaidhani, a member of the trust and chief of the local purohit association. “We will restrict the number of devotees in the main temple area. We are planning to use a two-acre open plot on the premises, where devotees can wait in queue for darshan while maintaining social distancing,” added Gaidhani. In Pune, Mahesh Suryavanshi, of Shri Dagadusheth Halwai Ganapati Trust, said, “Initially, we will start a darshan facility. Based on the preliminary feedback, we will make changes if needed.” Varad Thakar, of Shri Kasba Ganapati Mandir, too said all safety measures will be followed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/temples-set-to-open-doors-first-day-of-navratri/articleshow/86514495.cms||---
---||Mumbai||India is now in endemic stage, third Covid wave could be small, say virologists||PUNE: The third wave of Covid-19 was unlikely to be as severe as the second and India was now in the endemic stage of the disease, eminent virologists said. Dr Gagandeep Kang, a member of the Covid-19 working group and professor at Christian Medical College, Vellore, told TOI she could not really see a large third wave in the next couple of months with the existing variants. But, she said, there could be small waves limited to certain geographies. “Delhi, in all probability, had four waves. A wave is an increase in cases followed by a decrease in a relatively short period in a defined geography. We are unlikely to see a sharp spike in cases in the third wave as in the case of the second because of lower number of susceptible people and no new variants,” she said. Kang said she was not saying there would not be a third wave even with the existing variants, but it would be a smaller one in smaller geographies. She said earlier, there were a lot of infections and a large number of people fell sick because everyone was susceptible. “Now, with fewer susceptible people, there would be an increase in infection without an increase in people getting sick. This is a decoupling between the infection and the disease because of people being protected from severe disease owing to prior infection or vaccination,” she said.  Kang said an endemic was a disease that was consistently present at high or low frequency, which might differ in different geographies. “Given the virus has been there for over 18 months, with two-thirds of the population already infected by June/July and the continuing cases, we can reasonably say we have reached the endemic stage,” she said. Kang said a rise in the number of cases even in an endemic disease hinged on environment conditions and behaviour changes. Seasonal fluctuations, too, affect an endemic disease. Jacob John, another virologist, said, “We are in an endemic phase with numbers without many ups and downs for 12 weeks or 3 months. He said a wave in near future was possible only if a new variant more transmissible than Delta emerged. Epidemiologist Giridhar Babu said interpretation of terms such as endemicity was bound to be subjective and it needed clear definitions to track Covid’s next phase.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-india-is-now-in-endemic-stage-3rd-wave-could-be-small-virologists/articleshow/86518422.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Gurgaon||Haryana: Four hired to clean borewell inhale poisonous gas, die||GURUGRAM: Four persons suffocated to death allegedly after inhaling poisonous gases while cleaning a borewell at Nimka village in Nuh on Saturday. The men, police said, had climbed down the borewell to clean it after villagers had complained of foul smell. The four men — Jamshed, Sahid, Jakir and Yahaya — had been hired by a villager, Hanif, to clean the borewell in his field. Jamshed, who was the first to descend, allegedly lost consciousness soon after. Sahid, Jakir and Yahaya climbed down to check on him and they, too, became unconscious. Hanif, who was standing outside the borewell, raised an alarm and a group of farmers working at a nearby field rushed to help. By the time the farmers reached, Hanif, too, had lost consciousness. The villagers called for help and the four men were pulled out of the well. They were rushed to the Civil Hospital in Nuh, where doctors declared them dead on arrival. Hanif, the police said, is undergoing treatment at the hospital. Ajavir Singh, the station house officer (SHO) of Bijhor, said all the bodies had been sent for autopsy. “We will hand over the bodies to the families after the autopsies are done,” the SHO said, adding that no complaint had been lodged so far. “There was confusion and commotion at the site. A foul smell was coming from the borewell and people were hesitant to come forward for help. Due to all this, the rescue work got delayed,” a villager said. The villagers said they had wanted the borewell to be cleaned, but had no inkling that poisonous gases could be trapped inside. A government report had recently found a high level of contamination in the groundwater in Nuh and declared it unsuitable for drinking. The report had found high levels of chloride, nitrate, manganese and calcium and also noted the presence of lead and mercury, which can cause cancer. Around 78% of the district also has saline groundwater, the report had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/4-hired-to-clean-borewell-inhale-poisonous-gas-die/articleshow/86518382.cms||Bagish Jha

In phase 1, we are expecting investments of at least Rs 15,000 crore. Several companies have approached the government with proposals and development work for the project will kick off soon,” he further said. Talking to TOI, YEIDA CEO Arun Vir Singh said, initially 100 plots would be carved out of the area for allocation to industries. “We are expecting various kinds of manufacturing to take place in the area, including medical equipment, MRI machines, high-end testing, oxymeters and ultrasound machines,” he said. “A common facility centre will also be set up,” he further said. Singh said, the Centre would be providing Rs 100crore for the common facility centre, while the state government offered incentives to investors. This includes power tariff of Rs 3.95 per unit, exemption on stamp duty and on GST for 10 years and low water charges per kilolitre, he added. “The Kalam Institute of Sciences in Hyderabad had prepared a detailed project report and we have submitted it to the Centre. Once the project is approved, we have been asked to submit a fresh DPR. Once this is done, we will be able to begin development,” Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/medical-device-park-in-noida-to-draw-rs-15000-cr-investment/articleshow/86520139.cms||Neha Lalchandani

He has sent his resignation to KPCC president K Sudhakaran. However, Sudheeran has not divulged the reason behind his resignation. There are reports that the KPCC leadership is gearing up to revamp the political affairs committee and is eyeing to cut down the number of members in this committee. But both Sudhakaran and opposition leader V D Satheesan have claimed ignorance on the reasons behind Sudheeran’s resignation. Sudheeran is learnt to have been upset with the ongoing revamping process and he was of the view that there was no proper consultations or discussions happening in the party. However, Sudhakaran has refuted such allegations. “I have personally met Sudheeran twice to hold discussions. The leadership has not kept the senior leaders in the dark over the restructuring of the committees. All decisions are being taken through discussions. I do not know the reasons behind the resignation of Sudheeran,” said Sudhakaran. The opposition leader termed the resignation “most unfortunate”. He said a senior leader like Sudheeran should be there in the policy-making body like PAC and hence all efforts will be there to hold talks with him. Other senior leaders in the party have also made it clear that the party leadership will have discussion with Sudheeran to pacify him. “Definitely, there will be talks with him to make him reconsider his decision. If necessary we will go and meet him,” said KPCC vice-president P T Thomas. The resignation of Sudheeran has come at a time when the party leadership is having talks to constitute the new executive committee for the party. AICC general secretary Tariq Anwar has also reached the state to initiate talks with the senior leaders. The sources close to Sudheeran said that the present leadership has not made any discussion with him on the reconstitution of the committees in the KPCC and the DCCs. The present leadership has already met the group leaders Oommen Chandy and Ramesh Chennithala on this. These leaders even have submitted a list of their nominees, to be accommodated in the committees. However, neutral leaders like Sudheeran and Mullappally Ramachandran are of the view that they are being sidelined.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/kpcc-leadership-in-a-spot-as-sudheeran-quits-pac/articleshow/86516423.cms||---

I never planned it. It just came together organically. My parental home was in old Delhi where I was born and grew up and so Delhi 6. My closeness to sports and the National Stadium while growing up listening to horror stories of the Partition led me to Bhaag Milkha Bhaag,” he said. When asked if there were things that he had consciously kept out of the book that he co-wrote with author Reeta Ramamurthy Gupta, Mehra deadpanned. “Not really. That’s not how I make my films, so how could I do that in my book? It would be double standards.” Known to use mirrors during seminal moments in all his films as a metaphor for conscience, Mehra explained how it inspired the title of his book. “I have conversations with myself in the mirror every morning. And I see a different person each time. It’s a great reminder but it’s also confusing because I don’t know who the stranger is — the person in the mirror or the one standing in front of it,” he said, promising to solve the conundrum next time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/my-films-keep-going-back-to-my-growing-up-years/articleshow/86518419.cms||---

The magnitude of the achievement assumes significance when compared to the figures of some prosperous countries like Germany where over 10.6 crore doses have been administered and the UK where the 10-crore mark is yet to be reached. The CoWin portal data updated till 8.30pm showed that the total number of vaccine doses administered in UP had reached 10.03 crore. In terms of people, more than 8.15 crore persons have taken at least the first dose while 1.86 crore are fully vaccinated. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath applauded the health workers for putting their best efforts and creating one milestone after another. “This achievement is dedicated to the committed health workers and disciplined citizens. Every eligible person must get their teeka jeet ka,” the CM tweeted. He also thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for ensuring the delivery of required vaccine doses to Uttar Pradesh. It is heartening to note that the total number of doses administered in the country is 85.51 crore and UP’s share in it is over 12%. UP is way ahead of its nearest competitor Maharashtra where total 7.80 crore doses have been administered with Madhya Pradesh (6.08 crore), Gujarat (5.93 crore) and West Bengal (5.55 crore) occupying the subsequent ranks. Among districts, state capital Lucknow tops with over 35.5 lakh doses while Chitrakoot ranks last with 4.43 lakh doses. Ghaziabad (26.08 lakh), Prayagraj (24.4 lakh), Gorakhpur (25.04 lakh) and Gautam Budh Nagar (23.87 lakh) are the other districts in top five. In all, 24 districts have been able to administer more than 15 lakh doses, with Kanpur, Agra, Varanasi, Bareilly, Jaunpur, Azamgarh, Meerut, Sitapur, Bulandshahr, Saharanpur, Bijnor, Hardoi, Bahraich, Ghazipur, Gonda, Kushinagar, Lakhimpur Kheri, Aligarh and Deoria figuring in the after the top five. Experts hailed the achievement as remarkable but said that the state needs to ramp up the second dose figures. So far, only 11.9% of the eligible population in the state has taken both the doses. The state health department’s data shows that the 18 plus population needs to be mobilised more than the 45 plus age group, since the proportion of the fully vaccinated persons in the two categories is 6.1% and 21% respectively. “Those whose second dose is due must not waste time and get it on priority. Though a single dose also helps reduce hospitalisation and mortality, both are needed for increased protection and safety,” said a senior health officer. Meanwhile, the Covid-19 situation in UP is improving with the number of active cases in the state dipping to 177, among the lowest in the country, as just 14 new cases and 26 recoveries were reported in the past 24 hours. As many as 30 districts reported are now free from coronavirus infection with zero active cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-achieves-10cr-vaccine-milestone/articleshow/86520148.cms||Shailvee Sharda

Anand Kumar Waghwani was heading back to his Kalikapur home when he failed to gauge the depth of the crater. He was rushed to a nearest private hospital by local traffic police where doctors said his left leg had fractured. “We have been complaining to the KMDA about the poor condition of the road for several days now but without any development. There has been a couple of inspections but the road hasn’t been repaired yet. Following the accident, we have somehow filled up the crater with broken bricks but it is only a temporary measure,” said an traffic police officer.  Earlier in the day, a 19-year-old youth on a bicycle was hit by a heavy vehicle, while he was trying to avoid a crater on Hyde Road near Jain Kunj around 8.15am. Sk Mustafa’s condition remained critical as he underwent treatment at SSKM Hospital for multiple injuries. Also on Saturday, two pedestrians in their late 40s suffered critical injuries after being hit by two buses while trying to cross the road.

---||Lucknow||‘PM fulfilled welfare dreams of Pt Deen Dayal Upadhyaya’||Gorakhpur: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath paid floral tributes at the statue of Pt Deen Dayal Upadhyaya at DDU Gorakhpur University on his birth anniversary on Saturday and said that since the last seven years, Upadhyaya’s dream of ensuring the benefits of welfare schemes reach the most deprived is coming true under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi. The BJP government organised Garib Kalyan Melas across the state on Saturday to mark the occasion. “The inspiration behind Antyodaya Anna Yojana and many other public welfare schemes implemented in the country to benefit the most underprivileged of the country is Pt Deen Dayal Upadhayaya. He was very clear that the base of any welfare scheme shouldn’t be the rich but the last man of society. Now, his dream is coming true,” the CM said. Praising the welfare schemes introduced by the PM, Yogi said, “PM Modi ran many welfare schemes like house and toilet for every poor family, free LPG gas connection to poor women, and health cover up to Rs 5 lakh under Ayushman scheme. The benefits of these schemes are being provided without any discrimination. The Central and state governments are trying to attain the goal of empowering the most deprived and bringing happiness in their lives.” Yogi said the schemes after the outbreak of Covid-19 are testimony to the welfare-oriented approach of government. “Free ration scheme is one such example. Around 80 crore people in the country and 15 crore in UP benefited,” he said. “Pt Deen Dayal Updhyaya’s dream is being fulfilled under the leadership of PM Modi,” he said, adding that his government is committed to securing the future of the poor and the deprived. Under the programme, local district administrations identified potential beneficiaries of welfare schemes and linked them to the schemes on the spot. “The government is committed to providing medical treatment to the poor and needy. Till now, 6 crore beneficiaries have been given the Ayushman golden card through which they can access free medical services of up to Rs 5 lakh in government empaneled hospitals. Those not covered under this scheme will be given benefits under the Jan Aarogya Scheme,” he said. Yogi said the benefits of Kanya Sumangala Scheme had been given to 29,460 girls in Gorakhpur. In Gorakhpur, 68,341 women got the benefit of Nirashrit Mahila Pension and 26,525 people are getting Divyang pension, he said. Yogi said free LPG connections were given under Ujjwala scheme. “In Phase-1 connections were given to 2,44,519 women in Gorakhpur, while 19,000 new beneficiaries have been identified under phase-2,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/pm-fulfilled-welfare-dreams-of-pt-deen-dayal-upadhyaya/articleshow/86520154.cms||Arjumand Bano

The police have been given strict instruction to act stern against such incidents, he said. All the trade unions have supported the abolition of nokkukooli and if anyone or a group still claims this then they will not have the backing of any trade unions. “The government has decided to deal strictly with this anti-social activity and those who are still claiming it will face severe action. The government has taken strict action in the past and will continue to do so,” Vijayan said. Meanwhile, labour minister V Sivankutty has come out against the party leaders intimidating the businessman and also trade unions still encouraging nokkukooli. While commenting on the CPM branch secretary threatening an NRI businessman in Chavara, the labour minister said no one should intimidate any businessman in the state. When the state government is committed to ensure an investor-friendly destination, such acts cannot be entertained, he said. He also flayed the nokkukooli incident at Pothencode in Thiruvananthapuram. “The government does not approve of nokkukuli and no one should demand money for not doing any work. The government will move legally against those who are accepting nokkukooli,” Sivankutty said. The government is ready to hold discussions with the trade unions again to put an end to this practice, he added. Eight to lose labour cards The eight people who were involved in the nokkukooli incident at Pothencode will lose their labour cards. It has been decided to suspend their cards with immediate effect. The decision has been taken based on the report submitted by the assistant labour officer about this incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/nokkukooli-will-be-treated-as-anti-social-activity-cm/articleshow/86516471.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Cinema halls in Maharashtra are likely to be asked to run at 50% capacity||MUMBAI: CM Uddhav Thackeray has approved reopening of cinema halls and auditoriums in the state from October 22. Cinema halls and theatres were reopened in November last year after being shut since March 2020 and were shut again in April 2021 after the second wave hit the state. Theatre owners, filmmakers and artistes had been demanding the state allow theatres and auditoriums to function. However, the MVA government said it was treading cautiously due to the fear of a third wave. Senior officials said though SOPs are still being worked out, it is mostly likely that these places will be asked to run at 50% capacity. However, there is still no clarity on whether only fully vaccinated individuals will be allowed entry as most mutliplexes are inside malls and only fully vaccinated people are allowed inside malls. B N Tiwari, president of the Federation of Western India Cine Employees, said, “Viewers have missed the experience of watching films on the big screen for months. I thank the CM and urge cinema hall owners and employees to observe all Covid-related precautions.” Theatre actor-producer Makarand Deshpande, who attended the CM’s meeting on Saturday, was “incredibly happy.” He said, “Theatres are our temples. I am especially pleased because live performers and backstage artistes, who were out of work during the lockdown, can now resume their livelihoods. Actors can make their way to OTT platforms. But what do technicians and stage professionals do? I wish the audience arrives vaccinated because everybody, performers and audience, should be healthy.” Another participant at the meeting was actor Aadesh Bandekar, who as Shiv Sena member had placed the Marathi industry’s concerns before the CM. He said, “Now theatre authorities as well as audiences should follow all SOPs 100% to ensure we do not face another scenario of closure. Unlike cinema, theatre is a live performance. Moreover, artistes and technicians travel from one venue to another, often on the same day, for shows. The risk of infection must be controlled.” Welcoming the state’s decision, Nitin Tej Ahuja, CEO of Producers Guild of India, said, “Producers can now start planning for theatrical release of their films, many of which have been ready for quite some time now. The extended shutdown in one of the most important territories for box-office revenues was among the foremost reasons holding back Hindi film releases.” But single-screen cinemas are not likely to resume shortly. Nitin Datar, president of Cinema Owners and Exhibitors Association of India said, “Our sector is facing closure. We have been requesting government for concessions in property tax and electricity bill rebates as other states have given. Until that happens, we do not have the means to reopen.” AMC Suresh Kakani said restrictions may be further eased in Mumbai. “Though curbs on train travel were removed on August 15, we haven’t seen a mega surge in cases 40 days later,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cinema-halls-are-likely-to-be-asked-to-run-at-50-capacity/articleshow/86518567.cms||Bhavika Jain

---||Delhi||French writer recalls Calcutta connection||When we face a situation where we have lost everything, it is very easy to fall back and lose hope, but it is more important to go on, says Tiffany Tavernier, French novelist and screenwriter. “At such a time, love, kindness and compassion gives us hope. This is what happened during the pandemic. People met with crises but sudden kindness from unusual and unexpected places helped them survive,” says the author of Roissy, while in conversation with Naveen Kishore, publisher, on the topic of 'Kindness in Fractured Times' at the Times Litfest. She adds that healing is very important to go on in life. “Colours, music, language become very important in the process. It’s the light when you are drowning,” says the author, who lost both her parents — screenwriter Colo Tavernier and the director Bertrand Tavernier — in the past year and struggled with the void in her life. She says that she puts her personal experiences into her characters to bring them to life. “Roissy is lost in her own disaster like a lot of us during the pandemic and she finds a way out through love and kindness.” The author lived in Kolkata when she was 19 and still fondly remembers the place. “When I visited the place again two years ago, I was glad to see that the compassion in the people there is still the same. The place has a mix of intelligence and suffering. It helps you question your existence,” she says.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/french-writer-recalls-calcutta-connection/articleshow/86518508.cms||---

The party said it would bring about necessary changes in the state recruitment policy of the state in the larger interest of the people of the state. Recently, the state cabinet cleared a new recruitment policy in which these languages were taken out, triggering a political uproar. Addressing party workers in Dhanbad on Saturday, state party president Rajesh Thakur said, “Though the government has to take a final call, we as partners of the government would keep pressurizing it. I can assure you that these languages would be included in the list of languages for the competitive exams conducted by the state.” While talking to the media on his maiden visit to Dhanbad after he is appointed the state Congress chief, Thakur also took at the dig at the BJP government at the centre. He said Congress has a strong base in the coal town and all that is needed is taking the party organization to the public to get rid of the “oppressive” Modi government. “I will visit all the districts to get first-hand information on our party organization and make necessary changes in the organization keeping the ground realities into consideration,” he added. Earlier, he along with ministers Banna Gupta and Badal Patralekh and party working president Jaleshwar Mahto were given a rousing welcome by the party workers at different places. After a long gap, dissident leaders and party workers were seen jostling with each other to welcome the state president. “The Congress workers are elated as a grassroots-level party worker has been made the state president for the first time,” senior Congress leader Ashok Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/we-will-fight-to-include-hindi-other-languages-in-job-exams/articleshow/86515366.cms||Anil Ashutosh

On Thursday night, the Ranchi Police transferred about half-a-dozen police officers, including Sinha who is now posted as the court officer at the Ranchi civil court. It was learnt that Sinha had relinquished the post on Friday. Lalpur police station OC Arvind Kumar Sinha will now look after the daily market station. In his past two years as the OC of the daily market station, Sinha had won the hearts of the residents and shopkeepers, who on Saturday wrote to SSP S K Jha to bring him back to his earlier post till the end of the major festivities. Md Faiyaz, secretary of the Footpath Dukandar Sangh of the daily market cum member of the local peace committee, said, “In the past two years, Sinha ji changed the area. Earlier, daily market used to be a hub of criminals and drug peddlers, but that has been long gone and there is a dip in crimes in the area.” Rajendra Singh, a resident of the OCC compound, agreed with Faiyaz and said clashes were routine in the daily market area before, mainly during the festival times. “However, in last two years, not a single instance of such clash were reported. Mostly importantly, the general feeling among both residents and shopkeepers is that proper law and order has been maintained. This was one of the biggest visible change we experienced in the last many years. Hence, we decided to jointly send a letter to the SSP requesting for his service extension,” he said. The daily market in the heart of the city is a mix of residential and commercial areas. It has a population of at least 20,000 people comprising Hindus and different minority communities. It also hosts one of the wholesale markets of fruits and electronic items, making it one of the preferred shopping places for the city residents. “Instances of theft, mainly in market areas, had come down,” said Md Rashid, a mobile shop owner, adding that he (OC) was always well mannered and approachable in case of any need. “During the Covid-19 restrictions, more than penalizing people, he and his team focused on feeding people and motivating others to adopt Covid appropriate behaviour through awareness drives,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/city-residents-shopkeepers-want-their-favourite-cop-back/articleshow/86516478.cms||ASRP Mukesh

Soren will raise the matter during a meeting over Naxal and law and order issues of all states under the chairmanship of Union home minister Amit Shah in Delhi on Sunday. Earlier this year, the Union home ministry had reduced the number of districts eligible for LWE funds to eight in the state from 16. Soren had also raised the matter during a recent meeting of the Niti Aayog which was held in Ranchi. “The CM will also present records related to the action against LWE organizations and steps taken to curb them. The state government has also decided to seek the Centre’s contribution towards building necessary infrastructure in tribal areas across the state, which includes the construction of roads, assistance for Kasturba Balika Vidyalayas and comprehensive internet and mobile-telecom facilities,” a statement from the IPR department said. The statement also said the government will also seek for an increase in the minimum daily wage of MGNREGA workers, a long-pending demand to bring the workers at par with their counterparts in other states. The state will also seek revision in the conditions for the allotment of Eklavya Vidyalaya in tribal areas, the statement added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/hemant-to-raise-lwe-funds-cut-for-jkhand/articleshow/86515433.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||‘Anomie in post-Covid world reason for more urban suicides’||Dr Abhishek Somani, professor, department of psychiatry, Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital, invokes French sociologist Emile Durkheim’s concept of ‘anomie’ to explain the state of despair and hopelessness many are going through following rounds of restrictions and isolation. An increase sense of despondency is a very strong indicator of suicidal intent, add a pervasive sense of anxiety about the unpredictability of the illness, economic issues due to lockdown, increase in alcohol and other substance consumption, resultant health issues and verbal and physical violence at home. All these are an important mix to lead a person to harbour suicidal intentions. In an interview with TOI, Dr Somani, who is also the former president of Psychiatric Society of Nagpur, talks about this burning issue in detail. Excerpts... Q. What are your general observations about the upward trend in suicides? A. The social fabric is getting weaker. The earlier concepts of joint families and extended families is now seen in fewer and fewer cases. This important safety net is now missing. With the world at your fingertips with the internet, a pandora’s box has been opened. So you get influenced not only by the good but also with things not so good. The Blue Whale game is a good example. Internet also makes one aware of the lack of sophistication in own life. And with everyone putting out photos of having the best time ever, a doubt creeps in, ‘Why am I not as happy as they are? Maybe I’m a failure’. People have coped with the pandemic without a significant rise in suicidal gestures in the immediate period. But the stress of the pandemic and it’s social, economic and personal ramifications will increase mental health issues in the long term and we will see a rise unless urgent responses to mitigate these issues is taken. Q. Has the lockdown and Covid phase increased suicidal tendencies? A. Surprisingly not. There was an immediate phase of increase in anxiety and depression once the pandemic level started coming down but the number of self-harm and completed suicide were lesser than expected. We can speculate that maybe everyone was in trouble together so people derived strength from misery. Q. Why are middle-class people and even the financially secure ending their lives? A. Overall , the percentage of suicide is tilting towards cities. As per the NCRB 2019 data, metro cities account for nearly 25% of deaths by suicides in urban areas. The same data suggests that over 90% of suicides are by people from the lower social strata but common sense suggests that it may be gross under reporting of suicides of those with better means of hiding a shameful death. Q. How do you justify this claim of under reporting?  A. French sociologist Emile Durkheim’s concept of ‘anomie’ comes to mind. Anomie is a state of the society where commonly accepted values and meanings lose their acceptance, but new values (with common consensus) are yet to develop. Vulnerable persons develop a sense of futility and emotional emptiness. This feeling of helplessness and hopelessness is a potent indicator of suicidal intent. Financial stability is by no means a protection against mental stress. It is from the sense of contentment in whatever one has that mental peace arises. So money is not of much help in preventing suicide but definitely helps in hiding it. Anomie can be seen developing in the post-Covid world where normal interactions and communication have become a risky activity. So, putting on a mask, maintaining physical distancing are not a natural part of our behaviour. Q. Are you suggesting that mask and physical distancing need to go at some point of time?  A. We can’t maintain physical distancing lifelong. You can see that people are not putting on their masks. Only a few who are very cautions or paranoid about Covid are still following norms. Rest, everybody has abandoned them. This is a kind of anomie which happened when the normal societal rules are given up or broken down but there was nothing else to take up. This led to a feeling ‘I don’t know what to do’. The normal structure of life has been disrupted and there is no alternative. The mind can’t exist in an ambivalence. This ambivalence causes anxiety and anxiety has suicide as one of the outcomes. You need to take a side, whether yes or no. Due to Covid, there is lot of indecisiveness. You don’t know when the pandemic is going to end, who is going to survive, if you are going to get infected. Q. Is the pandemic the sole reason for mental health issues?  A. All the previous factors associated with suicide have been accelerated by the stress induced by Covid and lockdown. 33% suicides are linked to family problems, 17% to illness, 6% to addictions and 10% to money problems. Each of these factors further increased in severity during lockdown. Some families have come closer but domestic violence has risen sharply as any cop will tell you. Alcohol use has risen majorly. Covid hospitalization has made a major dent on family savings. So overall, the pandemic has accelerated the fire of mental health issues that people are going to face over the next few years. Increase in mental health disorders would increase episodes of self-harm unless we can make people aware about the importance of seeking help in time. Q. What are the early signs and indicators of mental disorders?  A. A noticeable change in the behaviour of a person over a period of time , typically 2 weeks or more. He/she becomes more moody, loss of interest in usual activities, seems withdrawn or aloof, sloppy appearance, suddenly crying or flying into a rage, talking about how better it would be if he/she isn’t around etc. But it requires a really keen eye to discern as we often give a long rope to those who have recently suffered a traumatic event. We consider that as a part of normal sadness. Talks about dying isn’t. There is a definite increasing number of violent and homicidal crimes and that can also be seen in the context of the lockdown associated anomie where social rules and values are becoming less important. Q What are the solutions? A. Prevention is easier said than done. It will require years of effort to create mental health professionals capable of catering to India’s vast need. Presently, there are less than 10,000 psychiatrists in India with an overwhelming majority catering to urban areas. Meanwhile, a sustained campaign in the media to highlight symptoms of mental health disorders, endorsement and acknowledgement by well-known personalities and simple things like giving your ambition a break, making changes to a more balanced lifestyle and sustainable life goals will help.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/anomie-in-post-covid-world-reason-for-more-urban-suicides/articleshow/86515183.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Tired, he approached this court by filing a petition. But here also, since the last two years, the respondents have not responded with the sensibility and sensitivity as is expected from them in a case like this,” a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Kilor said. Petitioner Subhash Shende, through his counsel SO Ahmed, approached the judiciary after he was retrenched by the high school run by Itwari Education Sanstha as the students’ strength was reduced. The action was taken as per Rule 26 of the Maharashtra Employees of Private Schools (Conditions of Service) (MEPS) Rules, 1981. He was declared surplus and was directed to be absorbed in Vikas Vidyalaya in Hinganghat town of Wardha district. Shende, who had joined the Itwari High School in 1990 for teaching English and geography, contended that there were two junior teachers who were below him in the seniority list, who could have been retrenched as per the general rule of seniority under Rule 26(2)(i) of the MEPS Rules. The petitioner argued that being a member of scheduled caste and the only teacher available for the subject, he was teaching higher classes and therefore, he should not have been removed. He made representations to the deputy director of education, but it had no impact. He also tried to join duty at the Hinganghat-based school, but he was met with stiff resistance there and was not allowed to work. Assistant government pleader Amit Madiwale then assured the judges that he would seek instructions from the deputy director and Zilla Parishad education officer with a view to restore the petitioner’s lost position and also bring back the honour due to him. The bench then adjourned the hearing till September 28, asking the AGP to file a reply on the progress made. WHAT HC SAID * Petitioner’s grievance with director & deputy director of education fell on deaf ears * He approached HC by filing a petition two years ago * Respondents have not responded with sensibility & sensitivity as expected from them in such cases * Made to run pillar to post since 2 years and society calls him a teacher||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/court-slams-edu-director-for-ignoring-teachers-grievance/articleshow/86515317.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

Those found unvaccinated have to present negative report of RT-PCR test conducted within the last 15 days, else undergo immediate RT-PCR test and face penalty. CMC officials said it is an established fact that vaccination is the only solution against coronavirus and the only way to stall the looming third wave. However, statistics suggest that the vaccination drive in Chandrapur city is impeded following reluctance and misconceptions among the people towards vaccination. There are over 3 lakh eligible citizens for vaccination. However, so far only 1.49 lakh people have been jabbed and only 69,098 of them have completed their second dose. With vaccination stagnating around 50% at times when the threat of third wave looms large, CMC has decided to push the citizens for vaccination. Officials have taken up a two-pronged approach to deal with the situation. In a first, CMC is going to start door-to-door vaccination drive for persons with disabilities, senior citizens and bedridden patients from September 27. The civic body will release two helpline numbers and a Google form. Those eligible under the drive needing vaccination can call the helpline number or fill the Google form to summon the vaccination team to their home. The second move will be to check vaccination status of probable super-spreaders like vendors, salesmen, shopkeepers, traders, labourers and people roaming around the streets uselessly. This drive too will start from September 27. Those found without vaccination certificate have to present their negative report of RT-PCR test conducted within the last 15 days. Those failing to do so will have to undergo immediate RT-PCR test and face penalty as well as action, as per provisions of pandemic law. The move is aimed at motivating the people to take vaccine, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/chanda-civic-body-to-undertake-vax-verification-drive/articleshow/86515368.cms||Mazhar Ali

He said six people, including a college teacher, had been identified as the alleged instigators who “mobilised people and created havoc”. “A day before the incident, PFI members visited Dholpur in the name of carrying food for the evicted families. We have the names of six people as new evidence emerges, implicating them in the violence. The government has already sent a dossier to the Centre, seeking a total ban on PFI,” Sarma said. The CM claimed there was proof of the six accused collecting Rs 28 lakh from the people of Dholpur over the past three months on the pretext of staving off the impending eviction. “When they could not resist the eviction drive, they mobilised the mob,” he said. Nine cops were also injured in the violence. PFI dared the CM to make “any evidence against us public”. “The CM’s allegation is a blatant lie to cover up the conspiracy to give the eviction a communal colour ahead of the bypolls,” a PFI functionary said. A delegation from All India United Democratic Front met governor Jagadish Mukhi, seeking a minimum of six bighas of land for farming and one bigha for homesteads as compensation to each evicted family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pfi-instigated-illegal-settlers-have-sought-total-ban-assam-cm-himanta-biswa-sarma/articleshow/86521863.cms||Prabin Kalita

Addressing the National Defence College here, Singh said there is growing realisation of India’s concerns over Pakistan’s support to radical and terror groups. “The turmoil caused in the region has been brought about by aggressive designs and the active support to non-state players by irresponsible states,” he said. He said there was an urgent need to draw lessons from the developments in Afghanistan, where the Taliban swiftly seized control of the entire country after the withdrawal of US-led forces. “The only certainty about evolving geopolitics is its uncertainty. Changes in state boundaries may not be as frequent today. However, the fast-transforming structure of states and the influence that external powers can have on it is clearly evident,” he said. Singh said India is fully committed to peace and goodwill amongst all nations but has shown its “steely resolve” to tackle threats to its internal and external security.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pakistan-using-terror-as-a-tool-in-afghansitan-defence-minister-rajnath-singh/articleshow/86521809.cms||---

Modi and US President Joe Biden committed to strengthen their efforts to combat theft, illicit trade and trafficking of cultural objects. The list of 157 artefacts includes a diverse set of items ranging from the one-and-a-half metre bas relief panel of Revanta in sandstone of the 10th CE to the 8.5cm-tall bronze Nataraja from the 12th CE. “This continues the efforts by the Modi government to bring back our antiquities artefacts from across the world,” an official said. The items largely belong to the 11th CE to 14th CE period as well as historic antiquities such as the copper anthropomorphic object of 2000 BC or the terracotta vase from the 2nd CE. Some 45 antiquities belong to the Before Common Era. While half of the artifacts (71) are cultural, the other half consists of figurines which relate to Hinduism (60), Buddhism (16) and Jainism (9). The make of these items spreads across metal, stone and terracotta. The bronze collection primarily contains ornate figurines of the well-known postures of Lakshmi Narayana, Buddha, Vishnu, Siva Parvathi and the 24 Jain Tirthankaras and the less common Kankalamurti, Brahmi and Nandikesa besides other unnamed deities and divine figures. The motifs include religious sculptures from Hinduism (Three headed Brahma, Chariot Driving Surya, Vishnu and his Consorts, Siva as Dakshinamurti, Dancing Ganesha etc), Buddhism (Standing Buddha, Boddhisattva Majushri, Tara) and Jainism (Jain Tirthankara, Padmasana Tirthankara, Jaina Choubisi) as well as secular motifs (Amorphous couple in Samabhanga, Chowri Bearer, Female playing drum etc). There are 56 terracotta pieces (Vase 2nd CE, Pair of Deer 12th CE, Bust of Female 14th CE) and an 18th CE sword with sheath with inscription mentioning Guru Hargovind Singh in Persian).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-modi-to-bring-home-157-artefacts-handed-over-by-us/articleshow/86521833.cms||Akhilesh Singh
---||Goa||Furtado vents out on Cong’s state of affairs||Margao: A day after Congress general secretary Vijai Pai and secretary Mario Pinto came out in open dissent against the state Congress leadership, former mayor of the Corporation of City of Panaji and Congress party functionary, Surendra Furtado, on Saturday vented his disapproval over the state of the affairs of Congress in Goa. Echoing the views of Pai and Pinto, Furtado said senior Congressmen have been sidelined by the party leadership. “GPCC president should stop sidelining senior Congress persons and work hard. Congress doesn’t need enemies from outside, we have many within the party. Nobody wants to sacrifice for the people of Goa,” he said. Apparently hinting at state Congress president Girish Chodankar and opposition leader Digambar Kamat, Furtado said that only two leaders were taking all decisions without taking others into confidence. “No executive or Pradesh Congress Committee meetings have been held in the last 10 months where we could air our grievances,” he said, adding that he has voiced his complaints to Congress observer P Chidambaram. Earlier, former MLA Agnel Fernandes and general secretary Yatish Naik had also voiced similar complaints. The outbursts of these party functionaries against the state party leadership have come against the backdrop of reports that Congress Navelim MLA Luizinho Faleiro had held talks with the Trinamool Congress which has decided to contest the 2022 Goa assembly polls. Meanwhile, replying to media questions over accusations that the party leadership had humiliated Faleiro, Congress spokesperson Tulio D’Souza said: “Faleiro is a senior leader who became chief minister, party president and AICC general secretary. He has been appointed as chairman of the election co-ordination committee. Besides, he himself has made a statement to a section of the media that he was never humiliated.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/furtado-vents-out-on-congs-state-of-affairs/articleshow/86519782.cms||---

When asked how BJP will face people in the upcoming elections as prices of several essential commodities have risen, Naik said, “The government is considering how to bring down the prices of some commodities.” About his own candidature, Naik said that he is a loyal soldier of the party and will do what the party wants him to do. Regarding his son Siddhesh’s electoral prospects, the minister said the candidature will be decided by the party. Over the last one and a half years, Siddhesh who is a Zilla Parishad member has not hidden his interest to contest the assembly polls from Cumbharjua constituency even as sitting MLA Pandurang Madkaikar has expressed his displeasure over the talks albeit subtly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/aap-wants-to-fool-goans-says-shripad/articleshow/86519929.cms||---

Luckily, no one was injured in the incident,” councillor Shami Krishna Salkar said. Mormugao municipality vice-chairperson Shraddha Mahale Shetye said, “The biggest challenge before the municipality is that it has only one tree cutter and he has to manage all 25 wards. Sometimes we take assistance from the Vasco MLA’s office.

Chandrayanguda police said that Sheik Ismail, Mohammed Tajuddin, Shaik Osman, Mohammed Sahil and Mohammed Rehan were arrested for killing Mohammed Asif, a resident of Karwan. Officials said that Ismail, a history-sheeter, came to know that Asif was allegedly spreading rumours about him ever since the former came out of jail. Though the prime accused warned Asif, he still bore a grudge against him. Ismail roped in other accused and allegedly hatched a plan to eliminate Asif. Accordingly, the accused invited Asif to a party at Puranapul, where liquor was served. Later, the accused had an argument with Asif and the victim was stabbed with a knife. The victim was moved into an auto-rickshaw, brought by the accused. It was taken up to Bandlaguda, where Ismail found that the victim was still alive. With the same knife, the accused slit the victim’s throat before the body was abandoned on the road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyderabad-five-arrested-for-murder-at-bandlaguda/articleshow/86521963.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Denied okay for Rome trip, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee blasts Centre||KOLKATA: The Centre on Friday informed the Bengal government that CM Mamata Banerjee could not travel to Rome for attending a global peace conference as the event was “not commensurate at the level of a chief minister”, prompting Banerjee to accuse the Centre of being vengeful and “jealous”. “I was going to represent India, it was not a vacation,” Banerjee said at a bypoll campaign in Bhowanipore on Saturday evening. “The Italian government had given me special permission. Several heads of state and religious leaders are going to be present at the event and I was the only Indian invited,” she said, stressing the country’s prestige was at stake and the Centre’s act had compromised that. “You will not be able to stop me. I am not eager to visit foreign countries, but this was about the respect of the nation.... This government (at the Centre) goes on talking about Hindu interests. But, if it really has Hindu interests at heart, why deny the only Hindu woman representative from India permission (to go there)?” Banerjee asked, adding that all the other invitees were Christians and Muslims. “I am denied permission whenever I want to go but you (BJP leaders) all can travel as you please,” she said, adding that the only plausible reason for the denial permission was “jealousy, puro jealousy”. Banerjee’s visit was scheduled for October 6 and 7 and the invite to the event — “Peoples as Brothers, Future Earth” — was an acknowledgement of “her contribution to the cause of social justice and her commitment to the underprivileged and the disadvantaged”, officials here said. The Bengal CM is the only Indian invited for the event; other invitees include Pope Francis, German chancellor Angela Merkel and Al-Azhar (Egypt) Great Imam Ahmad al Tayyib. The invite for the October event in Rome reached Banerjee on July 22. All foreign trips by CMs require a nod from the ministry of external affairs. This invite, too, was sent to the Centre according to protocol for its feedback. The response from the ministry of external affairs reached Nabanna late on Friday. The invite from the Rome-based Community of Sant’Egidio president, Marco Impagliazzo, had congratulated her for her “significant election and for the important work for social justice, for the development of your country and, therefore, for peace, which you have been doing for over ten years now”. “I feel your commitment and your generous battles in favour of the weakest and most disadvantaged (are) very close to my sensitivity and to the work of the Community of Sant’Egidio,” the letter added. The CM and her party had responded similarly to a 2018 cancelled trip to Chicago, which was to mark 125 years of Swami Vivekananda’s historic speech at the World Parliament of Religion. Banerjee had called that the result of an “unholy conspiracy hatched by certain people” and said the incident had given her “a lot of pain”. The organisers themselves had cancelled that event; another programme was later held in Chicago under a different banner, where RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat was a speaker. There was another cancelled trip to China before that, the cancellation coming at the last minute.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cm-cries-jealousy-after-mea-aborts-rome-trip/articleshow/86519794.cms||---

The day of their induction — September 28 — is also the birth anniversary of legendary freedom fighter Bhagat Singh. Meanwhile, Congress has launched Jawahar Bal Manch, a new outfit targeted at children between the age of 7 to 17 years, to instil in them constitutional values to counter a similar organisation launched by RSS. GV Hari has been appointed as its chairman The entry of Mevani and Kumar will continue the trend in Congress of inducting fresh blood in a bid to bolster its strength amid steady desertions by senior members. Mevani has been working in tandem with Congress and his induction comes with an eye on Gujarat elections next year. Congress is working on an overhaul of the Gujarat unit, and young Patidar leader and working President of the state Congress Hardik Patel is a frontrunner for the post of state chief. Kanhaiya Kumar is likely to play a role in Bihar Congress. He is a member of CPI but has been unhappy with the Left outfit while being eager to play a bigger role in state politics. There has been a buzz that an internal split among the key national leaders of CPI over promoting Kanhaiyya Kumar at the national level may have triggered his imminent exit from the party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/kanhaiya-mevani-to-join-congress-on-september-28/articleshow/86522001.cms||---

From using water-resistant materials to build pandals, to setting up platforms and arranging for water pumps, Puja organisers have started making arrangements, which are pushing up costs. With less than two weeks for Mahalaya, when the pandals are thrown open to visitors nowadays, rain has already thrown a spanner in last-minute preparations, forcing artists to shift to covered workshops, as many parks and grounds got submerged in water or became slushy after the downpour earlier this week. And, with the possibility of more showers around Tuesday, no one is taking chances. At Ekdalia Evergreen Club, helmed by sen-ior minister Subrata Mukherjee, organisers have already taken several safety measures. “The pandal will be covered with double tarpaulin sheets and there will be tin sheets around it. The place where the bhog is cooked will also be covered so that rain doesn’t disrupt preparations,” said treasurer Swapan Mahapatra. “We have also arranged for two pumps to drain out the water. We are building an elevated platform in front of the deity inside the pandal so that even if the place gets slushy, devotees would not face problems,” said Swapan Mahapatra, treasurer of the club. At Chetla Agrani Club, where transport minister and former mayor Firhad Hakim is president, organisers have incorporated several safeguards against rain and waterlogging. “A raised platform will be built in the park where the puja is organised. The place will also be covered with tarpaulin sheets,” said Subhendu Samanta, an executive member of the club. Members of Sreebhumi Sporting Club, helmed by fire minister Sujit Bose, will shortly hold a meeting to discuss measures.“But if there is a natural calamity, there is very little one can do,” said D K Goswami, secretary of the club. Members of Dum Dum Tarun Dal have covered breaches in the wall of the adjacent canal so that water doesn’t flow in and flood the puja space. “The area is flooded even four days after the downpour on Sunday night. The puja work has taken a complete back seat. We have covered the breach in the wall that separates the canal. We are using materials like bamboo poles, iron rods and palm leaves keeping in mind that it might rain during the festival,” said Biswajit Prasad, secretary of the club. Organisers of pujas that are held in parks and squares, such as Kumartuli Park, Mohammad Ali Park and College Square are also trying to figure out ways to incorporate safeguards against the rain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rain-check-pujas-take-extra-cover-after-late-monsoon-surge/articleshow/86519629.cms||Zeeshan Javed

Due to constant exposure to chemical fertilizers and pesticides in the paddy fields and also in the vast tea belt of the region, both migratory as well as domestic birds have suffered a sharp decline in their numbers, they said. Once found in plenty, now it’s a difficult task to spot mallard, wigeon, merganser and pintails in this region, said a birder. “There was a time when ruddy shell duck, which migrates all the way from Siberia during the winter, could be seen in abundance in north Bengal. But there has been a fall in their number over the past few years,” he said. Even raptors like Osprey, greater spotted eagle and imperial eagle are not being sighted like earlier. Environmentalists have blamed two factors for this — decrease in the number of wetlands and extreme usage of pesticides and chemical fertilizers. “Pesticides, after they are sprayed on paddy fields, get washed during the monsoon and deposited in the water bodies. This is highly poisonous and kills the fish. Hence, water birds do not get adequate food,” said Animesh Bose of Himalayan Nature and Adventure Foundation (HNAF). “It is obvious that the number of birds, especially water birds, is decreasing every year in the region,” Bose said. “This can be witnessed everywhere — from Gajoldoba in Jalpaiguri to Rasikbill in Cooch Behar. It needs to be checked,” he added. According to Bose, the drastic decrease in the number of wetlands in north Bengal is also a factor. “With the filling up of a wetland, the aquatic lives in them get buried. How could you expect birds to survive in such a situation?” Bose asked. “The same thing happened with Gossaihaat near the Khuttimari forest in Khuklung forest village in Jalpaiguri. The wetland here would attract hundreds of birds every year. But with no attention, the waterbody is filled with hyacinth. Now there are no birds here. Tourists, too, don’t visit the place, which in turn has affected the economy of Khuklung forest village,” Bose said. According to satellite pictures available, the number of wetlands in Cooch Behar and Malda has been reduced to less than half their number in the 1930s. In Jalpaiguri, North Dinajpur and South Dinajpur their number has reduced to less than one-third. According to environmentalists, if this trend continues, no natural wetland will remain in north Bengal. Floods would occur frequently and it will also result in arsenic generation, which is already posing a problem for people in Malda. Subir Sarkar, who is a Geography HOD in North Bengal University’s Jalpaiguri campus, said the maximum number of wetlands were filled between 1970 and 1980. According to Sarkar, the government should step in immediately to check further filling up of wetlands and conserve the remaining. “The natural wetlands are the most useful in maintaining the ecological balance. But over the years we have witnessed that these wetlands are being filled for agricultural purposes or for constructing houses. There are strict laws that prevent wetlands from being filled. But those need to be implemented properly,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/disappearing-wetlands-pesticide-use-threaten-bird-population-in-n-bengal-experts/articleshow/86518005.cms||Pinak Priya Bhattacharya
---||Kolkata||BJP connects with ‘chai pe charcha’ & more||Kolkata: BJP seniors on Saturday changed gear from the macro to the micro amid Covid restrictions in the Bhowanipore bypoll campaign, focusing on “chai pe charcha” and door-to-door campaigns for better voter persuasion. Union minister Smriti Irani walked the narrow alleys along with BJP candidate Priyanka Tibrewal, moving away from the high-decibel assembly poll campaign that didn’t yield the desired result. Irani bought articles from a shop on the Kalighat temple road before stepping in to offer puja and later joined the campaign. “Mamata Banerjee left Bhowanipore. She has come back again and saying she can’t continue as CM if she doesn’t get votes. We are seeking votes for development. Mamata doesn’t have development in her agenda,” Irani said. BJP national vice-president Dilip Ghosh also met groups over cups of tea at ward 70 and reached out to some houses to distribute voter slips. He came down heavily on the CM regarding her comments against BJP’s protests over “post-poll violence victim” (Magrahat leader Dhurjati Saha) near her residence. “Trinamool had introduced this politics in Bengal. Now she is complaining. There are many instances where bodies were brought to the city from Jangalmahal and Hooghly. If she can do it, she should better bear with it when someone else does it,” Ghosh said. In the afternoon, BJP leaders staged a demonstration at Hazra crossing against the CM’s “retaliatory remarks” over the dead. “The hearse carrying the body of Dhurjati Saha was one kilometre from the CM’s residence,” said BJP state president Sukanta Majumdar. Irani also paid a visit to Saha’s home on Saturday to reassure the bereaved family that the party was with them. Union petroleum minister Hardeep Singh Puri had also visited BJP victim Abhijeet Sarkar’s Narkeldanga home. Tibrewal said they were going to the CM’s residence with the dead to “show the body” because the CM had all along denied any such incident. “We went to tell Didi (Didi ke bolo) as she wants people to do. In return, we got non-bailable charges slapped on us,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bjp-connects-with-chai-pe-charcha-more/articleshow/86518029.cms||Rohit Khanna
---||Kolkata||Central team surveys flood-hit areas in Bengal||Midnapore/Khanakul: A central team arrived in Kolkata on Saturday to survey flood-affected areas in Bengal. One group went to Khanakul, Hooghly and another to Ghatal in West Midnapore. Meetings were also held with state officials at Nabanna. This was the third time Ghatal was flooded in the past three months, villagers told the four-member central team. The members said they would be submitting a report in Delhi. CM Mamata Banerjee had visited the area on August 10, and sent a team of ministers and MPs to Delhi in September to press for the Ghatal master plan. The cost of this is pegged at Rs 1,400 crore. Sunil Kumar Barnwal, joint secretary of the home ministry, led the team to Khanakul and held a meeting with the SDO of Arambagh. The three-member team visited Dhannaghori and spoke to the flood-hit who had been put up at a local school. Around 100 people staying there appealed to the team to help them as they were rendered homeless every monsoon. The central team will be visiting Udaynarayanpur and Amta in Howrah on Sunday.

On Saturday, after Navis Mathew, a 25-year-old doing his master's in accountancy in France, was declared brain dead at a private hospital in Kochi, his parents and sibling immediately consented to donate his organs. His heart was harvested in Kochi and transplanted in a patient in Kozhikode, with the health department and police creating a 'green corridor' to swiftly and safely transport the live organ. Navis's both hands will be given to one person while each eye, each kidney and the liver will be donated to one person each.The attempt to retrieve his small intestine didn’t succeed. Kerala's deceased donor record has not been consistent despite proactive awareness campaigns and greater social acceptance. Navis’s blood sugar dropped drasticallyData for the past seven years show heart transplants, for instance, at14 in 2015, rising to18 the next year and then coming down to 3, 5 and just 1 in 2019, ’20 and ’21 respectively. The data for liver donation for the same years cited above is 62, 64, 15, 18 and 3. Navis, son of Sajan Mathew of Kalathilpadi Chirayilath in Vadavathoor in Kottayam, had been continuing his studies online for some time due to the Covid-19 situation. On September 18, his family members found that he hadn’t woken up well beyond his normal time. Navis’s sister Vismaya, an eighth grade student, tried to wake him up but found him unconscious. The relatives rushed him to a private hospital in Kottayam. The doctors there said that the sugar level in his blood had dipped drastically. As his health condition worsened, Navis was taken to a private hospital in Kochi on September 20. On Friday, he was declared brain dead. “On behalf of the government, I convey our respects to Navis’s father Sajan Mathew, mother Sherin and brother Elvis who gave the nod to donate his organs even while they were facing one of the hardest times in their life. It is through ‘Mrithasanjeevani’, a government scheme for facilitating deceased’s organ donation, that the organs were harvested,” health minister Veena George said. “After the issue was brought to the notice of the chief minister, he instructed the police to ensure hasslefree transport of his heart to Kozhikode from Kochi,” George added. A team led by Kerala Network for Organ Sharing (KNOS) nodal officer Dr Noble Ignatius completed the organ donation procedures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/brain-dead-students-organs-give-new-life-to-seven/articleshow/86522028.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Law grads to battle it out in Bhowanipore||Kolkata: Led by chief minister Mamata Banerjee, the Bhowanipore bypoll candidate list is packed with Calcutta University law graduates. While the Trinamool Congress chief rarely dons the black gown now, BJP nominee Priyanka Tibrewal actively practises in Calcutta High Court and CPM’s Shrijeeb Biswas is known to hold his own in an argument at the Alipore courts. CM Banerjee’s chief election agent Baishanor Chattopadhyay too is a CU law graduate, who practises in Alipore. And, to make the fight more intriguing, several Independents and candidates fielded by lesser-known parties are legal practitioners as well. A total of 12 candidates are in the fray from the Bhowanipore assembly constituency, and it is an interesting mix of school dropouts and postgraduate toppers. If the CM, in addition to her law degree, completed her MA from CU, her key challenger Tibrewal has an MBA degree from Bangkok-based Assumption University of Thailand. Banerjee’s poll agent Chattopadhyay feels history is repeating itself. “Participation of lawyers in politics dates back to the pre-Independence era. Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das was a lawyer. So were our former chief ministers Siddhartha Shankar Ray and Jyoti Basu. CM Banerjee’s grasp on legal matters has always been our strength. Lawyers have been integral to politics,” the graduate from South Calcutta Law College said. CPM candidate Biswas, however, sees it as “mere coincidence”. The 31-year-old criminal lawyer, who graduated from Hazra Law College in 2013 and has been practising for seven years now, mostly handles cases of the Left parties. “It is mere coincidence that candidates fielded by all three major parties in this constituency are law graduates. I have seen Priyanka Tibrewal in court. She is senior to me. But on political turf, seniority in degrees doesn’t matter. It is a different battle altogether,” he said. Satadru Roy, the candidate roped in by Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular), isn’t a lawyer himself but has a few on his team. The principal of a private south Kolkata school, Roy boasts two postgraduate degrees and is also a BEd. “We know a tough fight is ahead of us. I have two eminent city lawyers who have been accompanying me on the campaign trail. They mostly deal with police and EC officials. My lawyers intervened when I was denied permission to campaign in some places and they also filed an FIR last week when I was attacked by unidentified people,” he said. Independent candidate Chandrachur Goswami has three lawyers on his team. A double masters, he topped in environmental science in 2017 from Midnapore-based Vidyasagar University and finished his postgraduation in vocal music from Rabindra Bharati, Kolkata, in 2015. Goswami has been campaigning hard over the past week. “Having lawyers on the team is necessary. It is a very tough battle and I need expert guidance,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/law-grads-to-battle-it-out-in-bhowanipore/articleshow/86518114.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Kolkata||TMC alone can unseat BJP, we don’t need anyone else: West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee||KOLKATA: Positioning Trinamool Congress as the “only party” which can unseat BJP, chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Saturday said “we are tired” of Congress’s “understanding with BJP”. “Congress couldn’t do it. They are trudging along with an understanding with BJP. We are tired of it. We will do it. Only we can. Bhowanipore is just the start. To defeat BJP, Trinamool Congress alone is sufficient. We do not need anyone else,” Mamata said. Later in the day, she broached the issue again. “Congress is scared. BJP sometimes manages Congress,” she said, adding “BJP, you cannot manage Mamata Banerjee. And that is why you always want to damage me.” Banerjee, who spoke at two back-to-back meetings while campaigning for the Bhowanipore bypoll at Collins Lane and Shakespeare Sarani, took on the NHRC for its “silence” on the Assam killings, daring it to slap a case and arrest her for speaking out. Speaking at Collins Lane earlier, she said “the road from Bhowanipore will take TMC to India.” The CM’s statements on Congress come on a day when TMC mouthpiece ‘Jago Bangla’ published an editorial referring to Congress as a “rotten pond which is losing its relevance.” The editorial said parties should be judged by performance and not by history. “The Congress has failed in 2014, and again in 2019. It was a similar failure in Bengal,” it said, “which led to the birth of TMC under Mamata Banerjee”. The editorial said “TMC was a sea which welcomed Congress workers to the real Congress — Trinamool Congress” — but added that “we are not disrespecting Congress nor are we speaking on an opposition front without Congress”. On Thursday, Abhishek Banerjee, while campaigning in the former Congress bastions in Murshidabad, referred to the “BJP-Congress secret understanding.” Mamata also singled out BJP for her sharpest attacks citing its “shameful human rights violation” in Assam, clamping down on Durga Puja in Tripura by imposing Section 144 and the PM Cares “scandal”. The CM's attacks on NHRC were her sharpest till date when she asked “Where is NHRC? You saw what happened in Assam? It is inhuman. They are dancing over bodies. Is this humanity? Is this us? Please come. Please see,” she said, referring to NHRC’s silence. “People have seen what happened in Bengal. They were sent here under every pretext. They didn’t even listen to me. What happened during the NRC protests? Is there even a count of riots staged and people killed? In UP, to fudge Covid deaths they hurled bodies in the Ganges. People were denied dignity even in death. When these bodies floated downstream to Malda, we cremated them with the dignity they deserved. Their religion wasn’t known to us,” she said, referring to NHRC as a “chupa rustam”. Mamata also targeted the Tripura government for imposing Section 144 CrPC during Durga Puja till Kali Puja. “I just have one query. Goddess Durga needs to come with her four children and their vahanas. Ashura too needs to come for her to slay. Will they fall under prohibitory orders that limit all gatherings to four persons? If BJP stops them from coming together, how will the pujas be done?” she said. Referring to PM Cares as a “big scandal” which “if probed will trap BJP”, Mamata said: “After accepting donations under the Ashoka emblem from government servants, CSR funds of industries, and individuals, they now say it isn’t a government fund. And they will not allow audit too. Is this BJP’s party fund then?” Referring to Iqbal’s poem in which he laments for his dead mother, the CM said: “Now that we have grown as a nation, it is for us to protect azadi. The only ism I believe in is humanism and to tend to people’s needs is our policy. The country needs to be rid of the BJP, they have caused enough harm.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mamata-tmc-alone-can-unseat-bjp-we-dont-need-anyone-else/articleshow/86517976.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Zoological Survey of India inks MoU with London museum||Kolkata: The Zoological Survey of India (ZSI) on Friday inked a formal collaborative agreement with London’s Natural History Museum (NHM). This is the first time that India’s 105-year-old institution on animal taxonomy, headquartered in Kolkata, has tied up with a leading international science research centre. NHM and ZSI have a shared heritage. NHM, founded in 1881, has been a world-class attraction with a vast range of specimens. And ZSI’s priceless archival fauna is available in museums all over the world, including NHM. Though ZSI was established in 1916, it wasn’t until 1947 that India started housing its own collections here, thus making ZSI the largest repository of fauna in south and southeast Asia. The MoU, valid for the next five years, was signed between Dhriti Banerjee, ZSI’s first woman director, and Douglas Gurr, director, NHM, on a virtual platform. Also present were David Gower, head of the vertebrates division department of life sciences, NHM; John Jackson, head of science; and Rosalind Glass, board of trustees, NHM. ZSI scientists and senior officials logged in from across India. Though NHM and ZSI, the umbrella organization for biodiversity studies under the ministry of environment, forests and climate change, have been working on projects and exchanging specimens on loan, this was their first formal collaboration. “This MoU was long overdue. We are going to be mutually benefited on faunal diversity research through scientific exchange between two great institutions and a long-standing relationship,” the ZSI director said. Gurr thanked the Indian government. “Since both ZSI and NHM share a passion for natural history, we can accelerate towards better science. Together we can preserve our crucial specimens and look forward to research activities,” he said. “The collaboration will not only benefit both institutions, but the millions of vital collections that are important nationally and internationally and help in sustainable management of bio-resources and the impact of climate change,” Gurr added. “We wish to work together to collect, study and conserve faunal specimens for science and create and exchange associated data and images,” said Banerjee. Through this MoU, the institutions are committed to implementing the 1973 Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Fauna, the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity and relevant national and regional laws and regulations concerning biodiversity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/zoological-survey-of-india-inks-mou-with-london-museum/articleshow/86518294.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty
---||Kolkata||Furniture Inc rides WFH boom||Once upon a time, furniture was about adding a distinct personality to our home. Today, as we spend our waking hours indoors amid Covid, functionality and ergonomics of home interiors have become equally important. This, in turn, has put the furniture industry on an upward growth trajectory Kolkata: There is no place like home. It is our port of anchor in a storm; our happy place to dwell after a tiring day. However, Covid-19 has somewhat altered our experience of being home. What was once a refuge from job stress is today our workstation. It is our virtual classroom and also our fitness zone. As both children and adults spend significantly more time indoors than ever before, a closer look at the functionality of home interiors has become imperative. “Before the pandemic, we had a small section for home study furniture. But now, it is a big and booming category, thanks to work from home. Furniture for children is also in demand along with those for balconies. Custom designs are seeing a surge as are items for space renovation,” Mahesh Shah, the MD of HomeTown. A pioneer in organised home retail in India, HomeTown opened its first store in Bengal in 2009 at the Homeland Mall in Kolkata and currently has four showrooms across the city. It has also tied up with e-commerce platforms such as Flipkart and Amazon to cater to changes in consumer demand, gain cost-saving benefits and boost operational efficiency. “Earlier, 10-12% of our overall sales came from the digital segment. Today, at least 17% comes from online selling. In fact, our overall digital sales are increasing by 50% every quarter,” Shah said. For Godrej Interio (GI), the online sale of cabinets and chairs have been on the rise since the pandemic hit India. A business of Godrej & Boyce — the flagship company of the Godrej Group — GI debuted in Bengal in the 1960s on Brabourne Road and currently has more than 200 outlets in Bengal, including franchises. It is planning to open 12-15 more outlets by March 2022. The product portfolio of GI comprises a massive range, with special focus on health and ergonomics. It has launched products such as the Chrysalis Nova Activ beds that assist in patient recovery and offer better safety to caregivers. Several such products are in the pipeline. It even has a Workplace & Ergonomics Research Cell, which regularly publishes studies on correct ergonomic behaviour for long-term well-being. A premium furniture brand in both home and institutional segments, Godrej Interio arguably has the largest in-house design team in the country in the furniture category that promises aesthetics and functionality. “We have introduced a novel concept in the furniture segment called the U&US Design Studio. Customers can turn their ideas into feasible designs with our expertise and best-in-class technology,” said Subodh Mehta, GI’s senior vice-president (B2C). Mehta added: “We also use a dual-purpose software application called 3D Room Planner, which allows store managers to create a virtual layout of the customer’s home and add virtual models of products as per requirement and specifications. This addresses many pre-purchase apprehensions such as colour sync, lighting and orientation. Recently, we launched a ‘visual search’ feature on our e-commerce portal to suggest thematically and stylistically similar products to customers based on the reference image uploaded by them.” Sprawling over 40,000sqft, Decoretti is one of the largest furniture malls in northeast India. Navin Agarwal, the director of Decoretti Mall at Sidhi NX, Eastern Bypass, Siliguri, said restrictions on mall operations had taken a toll, but they were sanguine of turning around the situation. “We launched our brand in 2019. The past 18 months have been tough, with the demand for hotel furniture going down amid the adverse impact of Covid-19 on the travel and leisure industry. However, we will soon expand into the modular kitchen segment for homes, complete with designing and installation.” Agarwal said they were reaching out to customers through games and quizzes on social media platforms. Winners were being offered redeemable coupons and home decor hampers. Decoretti is banking on relaxation of curbs during the festive season to make significant sales recovery. “We have launched combo offers to bring back buyers and boost demand,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/furniture-inc-rides-wfh-boom/articleshow/86518330.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Omnipresence is the future||Kolkata: Convenience of 24/7 access 365 days a year, with no downtime for holidays or bad weather, has always acted as a growth catalyst for e-commerce. More so amid a pandemic when outdoor movement is restricted. However, in-store experience has a high social quotient that many customers still value. This paradoxical situation has prompted a section of the furniture industry to adopt omnichannel retailing through websites, apps, social media and physical stores. “While customer footfall at physical stores plummeted in Covid times, e-commerce witnessed a double-digit growth. Reasons aplenty: Larger audience, better inventory management at lower costs and the ability to reach the farthest corners of the country,” said Nidhi Kapoor, the director and chief designer of ZAD Interiors, a technology-first company launched in 2019. “We have been able to execute several projects in and outside Kolkata in the residential and hospitality sector, courtesy our readymade designs, online estimation tools and a virtual store. Customers can choose designs from a larger catalogue, generate estimates in a few clicks and finally buy items — all from the convenience of their homes,” Kapoor said, adding that contactless payments and fast-shipping services were also major driving forces in e-commerce. Regardless of the degree of convenience an online store offers, can it substitute human interaction? No, feels Soumesh Das, store manager of DAMRO, Merlin Homeland. “A website or app cannot entirely replicate the skills of a salesperson and many customers still like a live demo,” he said. Ashish Shah, co-founder and COO of Pepperfry, refuses to categorise their customer base into online and offline. “We have adopted an omnichannel model for a seamless shopping experience. While our online platforms allow us to showcase an exhaustive range of products, our physical studios help customers get an idea of the design, material, quality and finish of every piece with able assistance from our in-store consultants,” he said. Ravi Nagar, Mobel Furniture showroom head at Merlin Homeland, couldn’t agree more. “On the retail landscape, both online and offline stores remain equally important. We have an extensive digital presence and yet believe it can never replace in-store customer experience,” he said. Joozer Hussain, owner of Furniture Junction on VIP Road, sees it from another perspective. ““Despite social and sentimental advantages of physical stores, e-commerce is the future for low-end furniture,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/omnipresence-is-the-future/articleshow/86518531.cms||---

This apart, indoor stadia and swimming pools have been allowed to open. Only fully vaccinated individuals will be allowed to utilize these facilities. The government has decided to ease restrictions as over 90% of the targeted population have got the first dose of vaccine, said chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan after the Covid review meeting. “In-house dining will be permitted in hotels, restaurants, clubs and bars with maximum utilization of 50% seating capacity for people who are fully vaccinated. All employees of these establishments also must be fully vaccinated. Air-conditioning would not be permitted and windows and doors should be kept open, as far as possible, to ensure ventilation,’’ said the order from the chief secretary. The government, however, has not taken any decision on the opening of theatres, but it has decided to withdraw restrictions for people who are not vaccinated or do not possess RT-PCR negative certificates. The CM said compensation for families of those who succumbed to Covid will be disbursed soon as per the Union government's guidelines. The health department is revising the Covid death data based on the new guidelines. Once it is ready, the disbursement of compensation will commence. State police chief asked to submit report, says CMSchools and colleges are set to reopen soon and to ensure the safety and security of students, both health and education departments have been asked to prepare a detailed guideline. In addition to this, the state police chief has also been asked to submit a report on the steps that have to be taken for reopening schools,” the CM said. All station house officers have been asked to convene a meeting of schools and PTA in their locality to discuss various measures that have to be taken to ensure students’ safety, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/govt-allows-dine-in-at-restaurants-bars-to-open/articleshow/86517309.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Dengue rings alarm with 24 fresh cases||LUCKNOW: Dengue cases registered a sharp spike, ringing alarm bells with 24 people testing positive for the vectorborne disease in the city on Saturday — the highest single day spike this year. The spate in dengue cases is relatable with the population explosion of mosquitoes after a heavy downpour last week left behind pools of stagnant water across the city. The surge in cases on Saturday took the city’s dengue tally to 238 this month, of which 99 (42%) have been reported in just nine days after heavy rainfall on September 16 caused extensive waterlogging in the state capital. The water puddles and rotting garbage piles that remained unattended for days turned into havens for mosquito breeding. Fresh rainfall in the past two days has made conditions conducive for the mosquito population burgeoning. Ppatients diagnosed with dengue on Saturday visited community health centres at Turiyaganj, Aliganj, Nawal Kishore Road, Chandarnagar, Silver Jubilee, Chinhat and Indiranagar with complaints of high fever and pain in joints. One of them – a 24-year-old woman – had to be admitted to Lokbandhu hospital, while others were prescribed medicines and are recovering at home. Vector-Borne Diseases Unit in-charge Dr KP Tripathi said, “All the government hospitals have been directed to conduct ELISA tests of patients coming with fever so that dengue cases can be identified at the earliest.” Meanwhile, the health department and Lucknow Municipal Corporation carried out mosquito control measures in Alamnagar, Saadatganj, Faizullaganj, Triveninagar, Shardanagar and Raja Bazar. One fresh Covid case; 19k take jabAs many as 19,329 people across the district completed their two-dose vaccination course after taking the second jab on Saturday. This takes the count of fully vaccinated people to 10.5 lakh. Government booths catered to second-dose beneficiaries only, while private hospitals administered both first and second shots. Meanwhile, only one new Covid-19 case was recorded on Saturday, while six patients recovered, bringing down the number of active cases to 24.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lucknow-dengue-rings-alarm-with-24-fresh-cases/articleshow/86522072.cms||---
---||Delhi||Major reshuffle, new departments in Delhi Police||NEW DELHI: As part of a major revamp undertaken by police commissioner Rakesh Asthana on Saturday, Delhi Police got a human resource division which will handle units like personnel management, training and welfare. The anti-terror unit (special cell), too, is set for an overhaul with four new DCP-rank officers and new verticals, with an eye on evolving threat perceptions and changing security situation in the region. “Law and order” has been split into two – Zone I and II – with special commissioners Dependra Pathak and Satish Golcha at the helm. The chief of the traffic unit, apart from DCPs of south, southeast, southwest, north, outer north and central, have been changed as well and new officers posted there.

More power to Special Cell to tackle threatsThe division is also known as the CyPAD cell, an acronym for cybercrime prevention, awareness and detection. While in crime branch, Malhotra had busted the nursery admission scam involving EWS quota at many Delhi schools apart from the espionage case pertaining to several ministries. He was, till recently, posted in the Narcotics Control Bureau, where he busted the Kasaragod drugs network and probed the drugs case related to Sushant Singh Rajput and other Bollywood actors. He also led the operation which resulted in the release of a young Mumbai couple — Mohammad Shareeq and Oniba Qureshi — framed in a false drug case, convicted and lodged in a jail in Qatar. Three more DCPs — Jasmeet Singh, Rajiv Ranjan and Ingit Pratap Singh — have been posted to the cell from central, outer north and southwest districts, respectively. “The special cell is being strengthened by more officers. The new mandates will be established keeping in mind the threat perception and security ambit. The units will be augmented with new technologies and human resources," a senior officer said. According to the order issued on Saturday, Muktesh Chander, a 1988-batch IPS officer who was posted as the Special Commissioner (ops and licensing), has been transferred as special commissioner of technology and project implementation division.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: New Town residents protest rising crimes against women||KOLKATA: A week after a young woman was allegedly molested by a group of construction workers on a New Town road and those protesting against the act were beaten up by syndicate goons, residents of the township on Saturday held a demonstration at the very place in New Town’s BC Block, where the incident took place last Sunday. At least two persons were severely injured while protesting against the alleged molestation and harassment of a young woman near her home, by a group of construction workers affiliated to a New Town syndicate. While one of the protesters, a 59-year-old PWD engineer, received five stitches on his head, another 45-year-old person suffered severe injuries on his legs. Six persons were arrested in the case. Saturday’s peaceful demonstration was in protest against Sunday night’s act and as well as rising cases of crimes against women, including snatching and catcalling in the township. It was initially slotted for last Monday but postponed due to the heavy shower that left most roads in New Town under water. With all major blocks under Action Area I of New Town participating, the 200-strong group of demonstrators, led by the victims of the last few incidents, discussed some of the major safety issues concerning women’s safety and vowed to submit a mass petition before HIDCO and the Bidhannagar Police Commissionerate. “We demand installation of CCTV cameras in all street corners, better illumination, by improving street lights and pruning tree branches. We also demand demolition of unauthorized roadside stalls, including tea and grocery shops, stalls selling fish, chicken and meat. The authorities should promote block community markets and removal of unauthorized hutments from green verges. Also there should be more effective police patrolling within the blocks and in the green verges especially in the evenings and nights,” said Soumyadeep Maity, one of the demonstrators.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kolkata-new-town-residents-protest-rising-crimes-against-women/articleshow/86522075.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Business||4 decades ago, India started its road trip in this little car||In the early-1980s, almost a decade before the economy was liberalised, an ambitious project – linked in the popular imagination with Sanjay Gandhi, son of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi – started taking shape. Unfortunately, Sanjay died in a plane crash in June 1980, without realising his dream of bringing out an affordable, efficient and indigenous small car that would appeal to the middle class, but not burn a hole in their pockets. He was not there to see his dream fructify with the creation of Maruti Udyog Ltd (now called Maruti Suzuki) – a unique joint venture between Japan’s Suzuki Motor Co. and the Indian government. The new company singlehandedly made India mobile and modernised the local industrial landscape, thanks to the clockwork precision of Japanese management and process systems. Right from the day it opened bookings on April 9, 1983, Maruti had the pulse of Indian buyers in its grasp. The opening orders crossed 1.35 lakh units (big even by today’s standards) by June 8, or just two months. Read AlsoWas the 800 really Sanjay’s baby?India had been making its own cars for a few years when the government woke up to the need for a cheaper ‘people’s car’ in the 1950s. In 1959, a committee described such a car as a “desirable necessity”. A year later, another committee seconded it. The idea remained on paper for a decade until theThe vehicle that led to this automotive revolution of sorts was the Maruti 800, still revered for its simplicity, efficiency, ease of use, adaptability, and easy-on-the-pocket price. At launch, the 800 cost Rs 52,500 in Delhi. When deliveries began on December 14, 1983 – a day chosen as it was Sanjay’s birth anniversary – the so-called people’s small car became the darling of rich and poor alike. PM Indira Gandhi herself handed over the keys to the first 10 allottees (all chosen through a draw of lots to maintain transparency in the licence-raj era). The first car was delivered to Indian Airlines employee Harpal Singh, whose picture while receiving the keys from the PM has become a part of Indian automobile history. Singh, who had sold off his Fiat car to buy the Maruti 800, got a hero’s welcome wherever he travelled in his new car – DIA 6479 – during the early days. People thronged to see the model that had challenged and single-handedly unsettled the mighty Ambassador and Premier Padmini. He fondly maintained and cherished the car till his last breath in 2010, never succumbing to the lure of newer and glitzier cars. The 800 never looked back again, as they say for all success stories, and went on to create one record after another as it caught the fancy of Indians who swore by its dependability and the ease of maintenance, which was backed by Maruti’s ever-growing dealer and service network, watched over for quality by the sharp eyes of Suzuki and the Japanese management. “It was the first car for me, and for so many from my generation, and even later,” Lt Gen (retd) Dr RK Suri, who is in his 80s now, reminisces fondly about the car that took him places but “never gave up”. RC Bhargava, the octogenarian bureaucrat-turnedbusiness leader, has been associated with the project from the beginning, and surprisingly, still serves as nonexecutive chairman of the company. Bhargava tells TOI Maruti’s birth “was really an accident….It was not as if the government suddenly discovered that they needed to modernise the automobile industry for some reason or the other. The passenger car industry at that time was not at all a favoured industry. Those were the days of socialism. And in a socialistic environment, private transport was way down the list because it was seen as a luxury product meant for the rich. “The government was always in favour of public transport… Maruti was set up because Sanjay died in an accident and PM Gandhi wanted that this dream of a small car should live beyond his death. That is why the company came into existence.” The government did throw in some ‘special favours’ to get the company going, including getting access to technology and allowing easy customs duty on parts (Hindustan Motors and Premier Automobiles objected to the latter concession). “It was allowed to have a foreign collaboration, and foreign equity participation of up to 40%. At that time, public-sector companies did not have any foreign equity in them and were 100% government-owned. An exception was made here.” However, Bhargava candidly admits that nobody even in their wildest dreams thought the company and Maruti 800 would become one of the biggest successes of an industrialised India decades later. “Nobody, and I mean absolutely nobody, either in India or outside India, thought that this (Maruti Udyog) project would be a success. Everybody looked at it as a political project, which would maybe last a few years. Also, they expected it to wind up because it was into car production,” Bhargava says, though quickly adding with a sense of satisfaction and pride: “The Indian customer thought otherwise.” Such was the craze for the Maruti 800 that even the rich jostled with the common public for early delivery of the car, just for bragging rights. “The public suddenly realised that small cars can also be sexy. The Maruti 800 was light when compared to the bulky Ambassador, yet strong with a more efficient engine. Such was the craze that for some time in the early years, it became a status symbol – almost equivalent to owning a Mercedes,” says auto historian Adil Jal Darukhanawala. The car – which had external and internal upgrades right till the end of its life – did enjoy a ‘waiting period’, and a real one at that, for years to come. The end, after mammoth sales of 27 lakh-plus units and crores of kilometres run across the length and breadth of India, came in the year 2014 (after almost 31 years) as the stricter BS4 emissions norms kicked in, making the product and even an attempted upgrade unviable. The relatively-younger Alto had by then replaced the 800 in the league of entrylevel cars. But the legend of Maruti 800, the people’s small car, lives on.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/4-decades-ago-india-started-its-road-trip-in-this-little-car/articleshow/86522068.cms||Pankaj Doval

In 1959, a committee described such a car as a “desirable necessity”. A year later, another committee seconded it. The idea remained on paper for a decade until the government invited private companies to apply for a licence to make a small car. There were 18 applicants, including Telco, which is now Tata Motors. None impressed the government as much as Maruti, the fledgling company of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s son Sanjay.Reports from the early 70s say Sanjay Gandhi had trained with Rolls Royce for three years, and on returning home he had started tinkering in a rented garage near Roshanara Bagh in Old Delhi. However, years later, Rolls Royce said he had only earned an Ordinary National Certificate in mechanical engineering – “a relatively minor qualification”. Qualified he may not have been, but 20-something Sanjay promptly got 297 acres in Gurgaon at “a little under Rs 12,000 per acre” to start his Maruti factory. The plan was to make a completely indigenous car that cost about Rs 8,000 apiece. In May 1975 – close to its ‘launch’ – the exshowroom price was set at Rs 16,500. On road in Haryana, it would have cost Rs 21,000 – still Rs 5,000-10,000 cheaper than the existing models. But the day when Sanjay’s Maruti would grace showrooms never came. In May 1975, he claimed he would start production with 12-20 units a month, and take it up to 200 a day in four years. Actual production till March 31, 1976 was just 21 units. That was all they ever made. In June 1975, his mother imposed Emergency and Sanjay jumped into politics, although his role as Maruti MD continued to pay him a then-princely Rs 4,000 monthly salary. Indira Gandhi lost the 1977 election, and in 1978, a court ordered the winding up of Maruti. This household name would have lapsed then, but in 1980 Indira returned to office. Sanjay died in a plane crash in June, and soon after, Government of India adopted Maruti through the Maruti Limited (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act that came into force on October 13, 1980. Three years passed before the first Maruti 800, made in collaboration with Suzuki of Japan, rolled out. Barring the badge on its rump it had nothing in common with Sanjay’s car.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/was-the-800-really-sanjays-baby/articleshow/86522109.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Cyclonic circulation, cyclone Gulab may leave Kolkata drenched||KOLKATA: The city is set to receive light to heavy rain over the next four days as two consecutive systems hit the eastern coast — one a cyclonic storm and the other a cyclonic circulation — with the latter one likely to have a greater impact on the city. These systems could be residues of bigger systems that originated in the South China Sea and had died down, only to regain strength again over Bay of Bengal. While a deep depression over north and adjoining central Bay of Bengal developed into a cyclone on Saturday evening, the cyclonic circulation is set to emerge over northeast Bay on Sunday. The cyclone, on the other hand, was stationed about 470 km east-southeast of Gopalpur (Odisha) and is predicted to move westwards and cross north Andhra Pradesh-south Odisha coasts between Vishakhapatnam and Gopalpur around Kalingapatnam on Sunday evening. The cyclone, christened ‘Gulab’, could trigger light to moderate rain in Kolkata and south Bengal, apart from generating a high wind speed in some coastal areas of the state, said the Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC). “We expect moderate rain in the city while wind speed may touch 50 km/hr in places like Digha once the cyclone hits the coast. But the impact of the cyclone will be minimal in Kolkata, though the city could receive rain on Sunday and Monday,” said RMC director GK Das. The cyclonic circulation set to develop over northeast Bay on Sunday, however, is likely to trigger heavy rain in Kolkata and south Bengal. “It is likely to turn into a low-pressure and move norhtwestwards and reach the Bengal coast around September 29. But even before the system reaches the coast, rain could begin in Gangetic Bengal and Kolkata,” said Das. He added that the city may be lashed by an extended, heavy spell of shower either on September 28 evening or on September 29. Explaining the frequent development of systems over Bay of Bengal, weather scientists said these could be ‘remnants’ of even bigger systems that originated in the South China Sea. They lose steam after lashing other coasts in the region but the residual clouds often float over Bay of Bengal. “These remnants then gather moisture from the sea again, acquire energy and re-intensify into cyclonic circulations or cyclones. These two are have probably resulted from such remnants,” said Das. The systems follow a cyclonic circulation that struck Kolkata and south Bengal last Monday triggering an incessant deluge that lasted more than eight hours, leaving most areas of the city and its surrounding districts waterlogged and paralyzing life across south Bengal. An orange warning for heavy rain has been issued for Kolkata and most other south Bengal districts including North and South 24 Parganas, Howrah, East and West Midnapore, Hoogly, Jhargram, Bankura and Purulia on September 28 and 29. Some of these areas, including Kolkata, could receive 70 mm-110 mm rain as the system passes through these districts, said a weather bulletin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cyclonic-circulation-cyclone-gulab-may-leave-kol-drenched/articleshow/86516149.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

Our government is working on the same philosophy,” he said. Modi’s reverential invoking of Upadhyaya followed a strident attempt by Pakistan PM Imran Khan to attack his Indian counterpart for his membership of RSS. Modi’s reference to Integral Humanism looked like an attempt to project the Hindutva ideology through a benign and welfarist prism. Earlier in the day, the PM tweeted, “Tribute to Pt Deen Dayal Upadhyaya ji, the pioneer of Integral Human Philosophy, on his birth anniversary. He dedicated his life to nation-building. His thoughts will always inspire the countrymen.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-modi-invokes-deen-dayals-antyoday-in-un-address/articleshow/86522135.cms||Akhilesh Singh
---||India||PM Modi flags Covid origin, ‘ease of doing business’ rankings row at UN||NEW DELHI: In remarks unlikely to go unnoticed in Beijing, PM Narendra Modi flagged the issue of Covid-19 origin, and also the World Bank ‘ease of doing business’ rankings debacle, as he denounced global governance institutions for failing to deal with international pressing issues. While the WHO probe into the origin of Covid-19 is yet to yield any result, World Bank officials were recently accused of allegedly fudging data to boost the ranking of China and some other countries. Modi’s remarks followed Quad partner Australia PM Scott Morrison’s call on Friday for an accelerated probe into the origin of coronavirus to prevent another pandemic. China has been sensitive to such calls and has repeatedly said that the issue of Covid-19 origin should not be politicised. “On the issue of Covid-19 origin and also ease of doing business rankings, the reliability of the institutions related to global governance, which had been built over decades of hard work, has been hit. It is important that we strengthen UN for maintaining global order, global laws and global values,” said Modi. For the UN to remain relevant, it needs to improve its effectiveness and reliability, Modi said. “Many questions are being raised today about the UN. We have seen this in climate crisis, also during the pandemic. The ongoing proxy war in many parts of the world, terrorism and now the Afghanistan crisis have led to more questions.” The PM went on to quote Chanakya to say that when the right thing is not done at the right time, time itself devours any chance of success in that task. While Modi didn’t name China, his UNGA address was replete with messages for Beijing as he also called for shunning the race for expansionism and exclusion in the oceans and underlined the significance of rules based order. At the Brics summit earlier this month, Modi was reported to have called for a transparent probe into the origin of Covid-19 under WHO’s aegis. On Saturday, he ended his UNGA address by quoting Rabindranath Tagore to say if you move ahead on the right path without fear, all your fears and weaknesses disappear.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-modi-flags-covid-origin-ease-of-doing-business-rankings-row-at-un/articleshow/86522160.cms||---
---||Lucknow||UP: Pratapgarh BJP MP cries assault amid political clash||PRAYAGRAJ: In a high-voltage drama in Pratapgarh, Congress and BJP supporters clashed during the Gareeb Kalyan Mela organized at the Sangipur development block auditorium in the district on Saturday. In the melee, BJP MP Sangamlal Gupta was allegedly attacked by supporters of Congress leader Pramod Tiwari and his daughter Aradhana Mishra ‘Mona’, who’s MLA from Rampur Khas. The MP was rescued by police and escorted to a safe place. He later lodged an FIR against Pramod Tiwari, his daughter Aradhana Mishra and 25 other named and 50 unnamed people under relevant sections of IPC, including 307 (attempt to murder), 146 (rioting), 336 (act endangering life or personal safety of others) at the Lalganj police station of Pratapgarh. In his complaint, the MP alleged that over 50 unidentified goons, on the call of Congress leader Pramod Tiwari, pelted stones at his workers and attacked him with sticks. Tiwari, however, alleged he too was brutally beaten. MP’s vehicle damaged, video viral on social mediaThe MP has also accused Sangipur block chief Bablu Singh of attacking him. “I had gone to attend the government programme where around 60 armed assailants were already present under a conspiracy and plan. They first attacked SHO Sangipur and then assaulted me. The attackers damaged my vehicle and assaulted the party workers with me.” Unconfirmed reports said Tiwari was also allegedly manhandled and Aradhna Mishra lost her mobile phone in the chaos. It is reported that many persons were injured in the clash. Sources told TOI that the two senior leaders also pushed and shoved each other. The MP’s vehicle was damaged, and a video of the incident went viral on social media. Sources said the MP had been invited as chief guest of the event and had to reach the venue at 1pm but was late. Tiwari and Mishra reached the venue at 2pm. The MP too reached a few minutes later, sparking a spat among Congress and BJP workers. After heated arguments, both the groups started manhandling each other. Police somehow restored order and escorted the MP out from the auditorium. However, in a video which went viral, some people were seen chasing his vehicle and damaging it. The programme was suspended following the chaos and police force reached the scene and controlled the situation. Tiwari accused BJP leaders and their supporters for the incident saying, “BJP leaders do not believe in democracy as intoxicated with power. Police brutally thrashed Congress workers.” Deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya said instructions have been issued to take action against those involved in the assault on the MP. IG Zone, KP Singh told TOI, “We are getting the medical examination of all the injured conducted.” Circle Officer Jagmohan said, “BJP and Congress workers clashed at Sangipur block. Police force has been deployed in view of tension in the area.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-pratapgarhs-bjp-mp-sangamlal-gupta-cries-assault-amid-political-clash/articleshow/86522138.cms||Rajeev Mani

The AIADMK and MNM accused the returning officers of acting in a highhanded manner, favouring the ruling party and allowing it to misuse official machinery. MNM leader Kamal Hassan on Saturday accused the DMK of forcing an MNM candidate to withdraw her nomination from a ward in Panamarathupatti in Salem district. There was no sign that the polls would be held in a fair and transparent manner, the MNM chief said. The DMK pooh-poohed the charges. “You must realize the reason for their allegations. It will not make a big difference if a party in power forces a candidate of a minor party to withdraw their nomination because there are candidates from major opposition parties in the fray. These are all mere allegations," said DMK leader R S Bharathi. MNM secretary Senthil Arumugam in a statement accused the state election commission of failing to curb the undemocratic practices . AIADMK advocates' wing joint secretary R M Babu Murugavel in a memorandum submitted to the Tamil Nadu state chief election commissioner cited specific instances of returning officers failing to discharge their duties and supporting the 'fraudulent activities of vested interest'. "In respect of four of our candidates, nomination papers were rejected without any preliminary enquiry and failing to provide breathing time to prove their side of the facts by concerned election officers," he said. NTK spokesman S Packiarajan accused the DMK of threatening party candidates to withdraw their candidature.

Foreign travellers will soon be able to arrive directly in Srinagar,” civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said at a joint press conference with J&K LG Manoj Sinha, here. The media interaction followed a detailed review of all aviation matters related to J&K, by Sinha and Scindia. Sources said Sharjah was chosen as the first destination for restarting international flights from Srinagar due to the heavy volume of business between traders from J&K, particularly those dealing in horticulture produce, and retail outlets in Sharjah, Dubai and Abu Dhabi. “More than 77 stores in Sharjah — mostly owned by Lulu chain — source their supplies of dry fruits etc largely from J&K. Similarly, over 60 such stores in Abu Dhabi get supplies from J&K. So there is a high demand of business-related travel between Srinagar and Sharjah, which is also a convenient transit point to reach Dubai and Abu Dhabi,” a source told TOI. Earlier too, Srinagar handled international flights but they were only for Hajj purpose. The immigration infrastructure is already in place in J&K, said an officer. Meanwhile, among the other outcomes of Saturday’s review meeting between Sinha and Scindia, was the former’s assurance to hand over 122 acre land in Jammu by October 10, 2022, for AAI to start work on a new 25,000 sq metre terminal at a cost of Rs 600 crore. Srinagar airport too is being expanded from 22,000 sq metre to 63,000 sq metre with an investment of Rs 1500 crore, said Scindia. The cargo terminal at Srinagar airport will open for business by October 1, he added. A paid premium lounge has also been approved for Srinagar airport and the bidding process may begin by September 30. Meanwhile, Jammu airstrip length has been enhanced from 6,700 ft to 8,000 ft, dispensing with the need to impose 30% load penalty on airfare. “This will make tickets less costly and bring more flights to J&K,” he said. Another measure discussed by the Centre and J&K government to make flights to the UT more affordable is proposed capping of winter airfares and a decision to reduce VAT on ATF (aviation turbine fuel) to 1% in the UT. “LG has assured that an announcement to reduce VAT to 1% will be made by October 5,” sais Scindia. The civil aviation minister said heli-tourism will also be encouraged in J&K on the lines of Uttarakhand. Scindia said the boost to civil aviation in J&K will have an economic multiplier effect, generate employment for locals and give a push to tourism.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/international-flights-to-begin-from-srinagar-sharjah-connection-soon/articleshow/86522238.cms||Bharti Jain

The incumbent DGP and 1987-batch IPS officer Dinkar Gupta has been allowed to go on a month’s leave. A native of Jalandhar and a low-profile officer, Sahota is holding the charge of special DGP of the armed battalion at Jalandhar. There are six IPS officers of Punjab cadre who are senior to Sahota but he was the chief minister’s first choice. Like chief minister Channi, Sahota also belongs to the Scheduled Caste community, which constitutes 32% of the state’s population. Sahota would superannuate on August 21, 2022. It is learnt that Gupta may move on central deputation as he had been empanelled by the central government in May last year . Other two IPS officers who were being considered as frontrunners to head the state police include the 1986-batch officer Sidharth Chattopadhyaya and 1987-batch officer VK Bhawra. DGP: Punjab to send panel to UPSCIt is learnt that Chattopadhyaya’s name was being pushed by the Punjab Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu but Channi chose to appoint Sahota. Chattopadhyaya’s petition challenging Gupta’s appointment as Punjab DGP by ignoring his seniority is still pending in the Supreme Court. After assuming additional charge of DGP Punjab, Sahota said, “Further strengthening the fight against drugs and keeping vigil on bad elements, besides maintaining law and order in the state...are among my top priorities." The state government would now send a panel of all eligible IPS officers for the post of state police head to the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) as per the Supreme Court decision of July 3, 2018. Only after the UPSC sends back the list of three suitable officers for the post, the state government would be able to appoint one of them as the state police head. If Sahota’s name does not figure in the UPSC list then the Punjab government will have to choose another officer for the top post. There are six IPS officers senior to Sahota, but three of them are going to retire in next six months - MK Tiwari is going to superannuate in February next year and Siddhartha Chhotopadhyaya and Rohit Choudhary in March next year. A 1984-batch Punjab cadre IPS officer Samant Kumar Goyal who is on central deputation and heading the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) has been given service extension till June 30, 2022. Panel questioned Sahota’s role in SITThen ADGP, Sahota headed the first special investigation team (SIT) probing the sacrilege cases and Behbal Kalan police firing incident of October 2015 during the previous SAD-BJP regime. Justice Ranjit Singh, who headed the commission constituted by the present Congress government, had raised questions over the functioning of this SIT for its lapse in not pursuing the investigation of two murders in the October 2015 Behbal Kalan police firing incident to logical end. The commission, in its first interim report submitted to the Punjab government in August 2018, had submitted, "Was this SIT constituted to give a decent burial to the case? It appears that this was with the aim to let the police officer responsible for action of the hook and to escape the rigors of law. CW-162 (Iqbal Preet Singh Sahota) would not have any valid explanation for this lapse in not pursuing the investigation of the case of two murders to logical ends." The commission’s report reads, "Virtually police have not carried out any investigation for deaths of two persons and injuries to others at Kotkapura and at Behbal Kalan. The SIT, which was to supervise the investigation, also did nothing."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ips-officer-iqbal-preet-singh-sahota-gets-additional-charge-of-punjab-dgp/articleshow/86522167.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Punjab and Haryana HC asks police to ‘produce’ child after father nails wife’s lie||CHANDIGARH: Hearing a case of inter-country child removal, the Punjab and Haryana high court has asked the Sonipat superintendent of police (SP) to produce a minor child before it through video conferencing on Tuesday and ensure that the minor is not taken out of the district boundaries. Interestingly, in this case, the mother of the child, presently staying in the UK, was claiming that the child was living with her in the UK. However, it was only during a video call that the child’s father noticed the boy was asleep most of the time (as he used to call him according to the UK timings) and on inquiry found that his son had been left by his wife at her parents’ home in Sonipat. Concerned about the safety of his son, the man has filed a habeas corpus petition before the Punjab and Haryana high court against illegal detention of his minor son from the custody of his in-laws in Sonipat. “In view of the aforesaid, SP Sonipat is requested to immediately depute a senior police official to visit the residence of respondent No. 5 and 6 (father-in-law and brother-in-law) in Sonipat, locate the whereabouts of the son of the petitioner, and satisfy that he is in the safe custody. The passport of the minor boy is taken into possession and retained in safe custody. The concerned police official would also ensure that the child is produced before the court on the next date of hearing through video conferencing mode,” the HC ordered while fixing the matter for September 28 for hearing. Justice H S Sidhu passed these orders while hearing a petition filed by Sandeep Chugh, a resident of Jind. In this case, the couple got married in November 2010 and had two children, a daughter (10) and a son (twoand-a-half years) together. Initially, the couple lived in London for a long time but returned to India for childcare. They had started living in Noida. Wife left home without informing petitionerDue to matrimonial discord between the couple, the wife left the matrimonial home in March 2020 without informing the petitioner, who was abroad at that time. Since then the couple had a bitter relationship and some complaints and cases were filed related to matrimonial disputes before police and courts. The woman stayed with her parents at Sonipat. According to the petitioner, in May 2021, his wife left for the UK and when he came to know about this fact, he had filed an online application before the family division of the high court in London for an inherent jurisdiction order in relation to the minor children seeking relief of summary return of the children to India, for location and passport orders and for a range of other orders to ensure the well-being of the children. On this, the wife appeared before the court in London through VC and stated that she had removed the children from India without the knowledge or consent of the petitioner because she did not know his whereabouts. Through its order dated July 26, the family division of the high court, London directed the wife to make the children available to spend time with the petitioner by way of video, and/or telephone calls on every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 6 pm GMT. Advocate Anil Malhotra, counsel for the petitioner, submitted to the HC that the two-and-a-half-yearold son of the petitioner is presently in the illegal custody of the petitioner’s in-laws and the wife has gone to the UK leaving him behind. The petitioner apprehends that his son may be removed to an undisclosed destination abroad or any other place beyond the jurisdiction of this court, the counsel told the HC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-and-haryana-hc-asks-police-to-produce-child-after-father-nails-wifes-lie/articleshow/86522164.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Haryana: BJP’s Birender Singh attends O P Chautala’s INLD rally in Jind||Former Union minister and senior BJP leader Birender Singh on Saturday not only attended the rally organized by Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) in Jind but also spoke in favour of the farmers. Interestingly, the senior leader from Haryana’s Bangar belt also praised the INLD supremo O P Chautala, who has been his main political rival in the state’s politics. Most of the leaders who attended the political gathering and rally organised to commemorate the 108th birth anniversary of former deputy prime minister Devi Lal at Jind, spoke in favour of the farmers and launched scathing attacks on the BJPled government at the Centre. The speakers also appealed to regional parties to join hands against BJP. Expressing concern for the farmers, Birender, whose son Brijendra Singh is BJP MP from Hisar parliamentary seat, said the wealth of the country is in the hands of a few people and the farmers have failed to reach that level. He claimed that soon a new leader would emerge who would give a new direction to the farmers.The senior leader, who had joined BJP from the Congress after the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, said he had attended the event on the personal invitation of O P Chautala and would continue to attend such events in future if is invited. ‘Those trying to damage brotherhood of Haryana won’t succeed’The senior leader, who had joined BJP from the Congress after the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, said he had attended the event on the personal invitation of O P Chautala and would continue to attend such events in future if invited. Birender recalled his association with Devi Lal when he became an MLA in 1977 and said he still remembers that Devi Lal had asked him to follow principle-based politics. In an indirect attack on the BJP-led coalition government in Haryana, Birender said those trying to create a “divide” or damage the “brotherhood” of the state would not succeed. Launching another indirect attack on deputy chief minister and JJP leader Dushyant Chautala, the seasoned leader said that Devi Lal was a symbol of sacrifice as he had sacrificed the post of prime minister but today people do not bother the values for small posts of MLA, MP, minister, deputy CM or CM’s post. The veteran leader also praised former Punjab CM Parkash Singh Badal, who was one of the attendees and narrated about his struggle and contribution to politics. Birender claimed that he was also allured of corruption in politics but he always maintained a distance because of the strong legacy of being a descendent of legendary farmer leader Sir Chotu Ram and the teachings given by Devi Lal. Addressing the gathering, former CM O P Chautala promised the people to provide more employment if his party formed the next government in the state. The veteran leader also claimed that the central government has been deliberately delaying the Ellenabad bypoll. “They know that when INLD wins with the highest margin, all of them would lose their security deposits. I am sure that after the Ellenabad bypoll, the coalition government in Haryana would fall and many of those supporting the government would join us,” the Senior Chautala claimed and said that the farmers would win in their ongoing struggle against the Centre’s farm laws. Shiromani Akali Dal patriarch Parkash Singh Badal also appealed to the people to strengthen regional political parties, as they are the true representatives of the people. “Those sitting in Delhi do not know about the plight of the people in the villages. They cannot understand the problems of farmers. I would request all regional parties to join hands together if they want to form a government,” Badal Senior added. The veteran leader also said that when he was in Tihar jail during the Emergency, most of the leaders of political parties lodged there had joined hands and it was only because of their unity, they had formed a government after the Emergency. Farooq Abdullah, former CM of Jammu and Kashmir, said he saluted the people of Haryana for producing such a large number of soldiers who are guarding the country’s borders and producing the highest number of sportspersons of international standards. Launching an attack on the BJP government at the Centre, Farooq said by abrogating Article 370, the BJP has actually weakened India. “They (BJP and RSS) think Ram belongs only to BJP and RSS but I would say Ram belongs to everyone. Kashmiris grabbed Gandhi’s India, not Jinnah’s Pakistan. We have to die here to live. They believe in the division. They lie every day. They have to win hearts like former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee. It is only because of their policies, today no neighbouring country is with us,” Abdullah added. Talking about farmers, the former J&K CM said they are feeding the entire nation and what is the harm if they are asking for quashing the laws not suitable to them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/haryana-bjps-birender-singh-attends-o-p-chautalas-inld-rally-in-jind/articleshow/86522191.cms||Ajay Sura
---||Raipur||Minor deaf-mute girls chased naked, sexually assaulted in Chhattisgarh||RAIPUR: No one heard their silent screams as the men supposed to protect deaf and mute minor girls at a government-run shelter in tribal Jashpur sexually assaulted them, chased them naked down corridors, beat them mercilessly, and raped at least one of them on Wednesday night. The horror shook the state to the core. Both the accused — caretaker Rajesh Ram and watchman Narendra Bhagat — were arrested on Saturday and the traumatized children are being counselled and treated for their injuries. A woman caretaker, who tried to stop the savagery but was locked up by the two men, is a witness to the torture, as are the other inmates, who include boys and girls aged below 13. Girls aged between 13 and 17 were preyed upon, say police, adding that they are investigating if this has happened in the past as well. The shelter, a residential training centre for the specially abled, is barely 100 metres from a police station and 50 metres from the Jashpur collector’s office. It is sponsored under District Mineral Funds for Rajiv Gandhi Shiksha Mission. Additional SP Pratibha Pande said that since the girls are in shock, injured and can neither speak nor hear, it took some time for police to take down their statements. What unfolded left even seasoned cops shaken. The children narrated, through signs and gestures, how they were stripped, beaten, chased naked and sexually assaulted on the night of September 22. One of them, a 17-year-old, was raped. According to the statement of the woman sweeper who was present during the incident, the two men bolted her room from outside when she tried to protect the girls. She said she could hear the sound of running footsteps, of slaps and kicks, and bodies being hurled to the ground. Horrified, she says, she tried to break down the door with her bare hands but couldn’t. She called up shelter superintendent Sanjay Ram, who was on leave. He rushed to the training centre, but allegedly tried to hush up everything. On Friday, however, news got out when an employee of the centre narrated the incident to a local journalist, who alerted police. ASP Pande immediately went to the shelter and ensured the children got medical attention. She spoke to them, carried out a preliminary investigation and found that a minor had been raped and teenage girls sexually assaulted by the caretaker and watchman. An FIR was lodged late on Friday. Jashpur collector Mahadev Kanwre ordered an inquiry, suspended superintendent Sanjay Ram, and showcaused Vinod Paikra, the district convener of Rajiv Gandhi Shiksha Mission. Rajesh and Narendra have been booked under Pocso Act and IPC sections 376 (rape) and 354 (molestation and assaulting a woman), said Jashpur SP Vijay Agrawal. According to sources, the residential training centre accommodates 46 ‘Divyang’ children, both girls and boys. In violation of government rules, the superintendent is a man, who handles this additional charge along with his teaching assignment in a school. Moreover, the staff at the centre isn’t trained in sign language. It’s a chilling rerun of the sexual assault on 15 minor girls at a residential school in Kanker’s Jhaliamari area in 2013. Among the accused then were the hostel superintendent, sweeper, caretaker, and watchmen. At a time like this, the post of chairperson, Chhattisgarh commission for child rights, is lying vacant for months. The commission has a crucial role in counselling child survivors and the judicial proceedings. BJP national vice-president and former chief minister Raman Singh has termed the incident as “shameful” and said: “Daughters in this state aren’t safe. It seems there’s no policy in Chhattisgarh. Efforts were being made to hush up the matter, which is even more shameful. There should be a proper judicial probe and strict action against the accused.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/raipur/deaf-mute-girl-raped-at-chhattisgarh-government-shelter/articleshow/86522299.cms||Rashmi Drolia
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Subsidy on for e-vehicles costing more than Rs 15 lakh||CHANDIGARH: The UT administration has removed its proposed upper limit of Rs15 lakh on purchase of electric vehicles (EVs) for availing subsidy in its first ever e-vehicle policy. Earlier, the UT had proposed that state-level financial incentive will be given on purchase of all types of electric vehicles except those above Rs 15 lakh. This condition no longer exists. TimesViewThis is a good move to push buyers to go in for electric vehicles. It is also in sync with the central government policy to switch over to electric motor-powered vehicles. Despite the incentisation of EV sales, a lot more needs to be done. The foremost is provision of affordable accessible chargers at public spaces as well as incentives to install these at home.UT adviser Dharam Pal had recently formed a threemember committee to submit its report on financial incentives to be given to buyers in a bid to promote e-vehicles. They will be besides those offered by the Centre, according to a senior UT official. The committee comprises deputy commissioner, municipal commissioner and Crest CEO. A senior official said it was discussed that electric vehicles price start from around Rs 15 lakh and by not giving subsidy to this segment, the basic purpose of the policy will be defeated. Accordingly, the decision was taken to remove the upper limit. However, deliberations are going on to finalise the policy, he added. The Crest, in its draft policy, has proposed to waive registration fee for e-vehicles already exempted from road tax till 2023. The proposal suggests incentives of Rs 5,000 for buyers of first 1,000 electric cars, Rs 5,000 for buyers of first 2,000 electric two-wheelers, Rs 30,000 for registered owners of electric three wheelers, including e-rickshaws. The incentive of Rs 5,000 on purchase of fourwheelers will be subject to a maximum of Rs 75,000 per vehicle, which means the incentive proposed by the UT along with that under FAME should not be more than the amount.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/chandigarh-subsidy-on-for-e-vehicles-costing-more-than-rs-15-lakh/articleshow/86522200.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Don’t widen road inside Gir sanctuary, say experts||AHMEDABAD: After opposing the upgradation of a railway track through Gir sanctuary, wildlife experts are objecting to a proposal to widen and upgrade a road running through the core lion habitat. The proposed 14km road lies near the controversial railway track and is part of State Highway 111 that connects Visavadar to Sasan. Wildlife experts are of the view that converting it into a tarred road will be highly detrimental to Gir. It will cause an increase in speeding vehicles, leading to accidents involving wild animals. Rajesh Chudasama, the BJP MP from Junagadh, wrote to the Union forest ministry on September 21, seeking quick approval for the project. This project was proposed by the roads and buildings department in April, the letter says. The department sought permission to upgrade the highway, which is currently a kutcha road, to a pucca road with a bitumen surface. “Many wildlife lovers have written to the state government objecting to the proposal. The proposed project will divide the sanctuary into two parts and cause difficulty to wild animals crossing from one side to another,” said Revtubha Raijada, member of the Gir Sanctuary and National Park advisory committee. Often lions and leopards are sighted on this road. Upgrading it will give illegal visitors free access to protected areas. “Apart from the increased threat of poaching, illegal lion shows will also increase. The strength of Gir is in its compactness. The increased traffic will not only disturb lion corridors, but also fragment the habitat. Free movement of the big cats will be restricted and they will be confined to small territories, leading to inbreeding,” said Bhushan Pandya, a wellknown wildlife photographer and an expert on Gir wildlife. There is an alternative route outside the sanctuary which is in need of urgent repair. The government should take up work on this road as soon as possible, wildlife experts said. Presently there is restriction on heavy vehicles inside the sanctuary and internal roads are closed from dusk till dawn. The proposal will first be presented to the state board for wildlife for clearance after which it will go to the National Board for Wildlife for final approval, said an official in the forest department. The Gujarat high court recently directed the Indian Railways to file a detailed affidavit regarding the impact of the proposed broad-gauge conversion and electrification of the railway track passing through Gir sanctuary on lions and other wildlife in the area. The court was hearing a civil application on the impact of the proposed upgrade to the railway lines and laying of oil and gas pipelines as well as optical fibre through the sanctuary. “The tar surfacing of Sasan-Kasiya road running from the core of the sanctuary will lead to more deaths of small mammals and will be dangerous to lions and leopards, as many have died in road accidents recently,” said lawyer Abhisst Thaker, who litigates for various wildlife causes. He said the Union forest ministy, in a letter dated December 22, 2014 to principal secretaries of forest departments of all states, clearly said that new roads shall not be proposed inside national parks and sanctuaries. “The proposal is for a new surfaced road and does not follow the guidelines set by the Union forest ministry,” Thaker said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-dont-widen-road-inside-gir-sanctuary-say-experts/articleshow/86522381.cms||Maulik Pathak
---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: Sohna elevated road to be ready by June 2022, says NHAI||GURUGRAM: The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has set June 2022 as the revised deadline for the Sohna elevated road project. Earlier this week, Union minister Nitin Gadkari had announced that the project was likely to be completed by March next year. Earlier, the deadline was July this year. NHAI officials, however, said the project — especially the stretch between Subhash Chowk and Badshapur — will take another eight to nine months to get completed. The highways authority said it has prepared a revised action plan after reviewing the work status and the on-ground situation of the 22km-long road. The Badshapur to Sohna stretch, however, may be ready earlier as 85% of work on that stretch has been completed. “We have reviewed the status of the project. While the progress on the stretch between Badshapur to Sohna is satisfactory with nearly 85% of work completed, the pace of construction on the stretch between Subhash Chowk and Badshapur has been very tardy and only 50%-60% of it has been completed so far,” said a senior NHAI official. “We have chalked out a plan to expedite work. Certain work, especially that being carried out within barricaded areas, can be conducted both day and night to cover up for time lost in the past few months due to the pandemic and labor crunch,” the official added. With an overall project cost of Rs 1,300 crore, two different agencies were awarded contracts to finish the ambitious high-speed corridor. NHAI is constructing several flyovers and underpasses along the stretch to provide signal-free passage to commuters. It will not only decongest Vatika Chowk, but also reduce the travel time between Gurugram and Alwar. Construction began in 2018 and NHAI was expected to finish all work within 25 months. “Every time the project picked up pace, there were roadblocks. In 2019, the prolonged ban on construction activities cost us over two months. The first half of 2020 saw no work due to the lockdown, while in the second half we kept waiting for NHAI’s investigation into the unfortunate collapse of a section of the road. If all goes well and we face no other hindrances, we shall be able to meet the deadline,” said an official of Oriental Engineering, the contractor constructing the stretch between Subhash Chowk and Badshapur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/sohna-elevated-road-to-be-ready-by-june-2022-says-nhai/articleshow/86518848.cms||Siddharth Tiwari

According to the department of health and family welfare, nearly 3,000 doctors, including specialists, have been roped in to manage the third wave and another 2,000 are expected to join the service in the coming weeks. The additional personnel are being onboarded through both direct recruitment and compulsory ruralservice deputations. “Direct recruitment of 850 GDMOs [general duty medical officers] was completed by the department two months ago, while another 800 have joined as part of the mandatory rural service. Aside from this, around 950 doctors have come in through the medical education department for the rural service,” health commissioner Dr KV Trilok Chandra told STOI. Apart from these 2,550 doctors, the health department has also completed the direct recruitment of 350 specialist doctors. “Another 2,000 specialists will join under the rural service programme soon,” Chandra added. With this, the total number of new recruitments will touch 4,900. The health department, however, did not immediately share details of what the total number of doctors in the state would be with these additions. Medical infra & supplyIn terms of medical infrastructure, the government has set up 500 paediatric HDU/ICU beds across districts, which takes the total number of such beds to 800. “...As on date, we have enhanced the number to 800 from 300 earlier. Work is underway to add another 1,200 such beds, which will be available in the coming weeks. This will take the total number of such beds to 2,000,” he said. The government has 5 lakh vials of Remdesivir in stock and adequate quantities of other essential supplies needed for treatment, according to the health commissioner. Also, 8,000 oxygen concentrators have been distributed to supplement the HDU/ICU beds in the districts. “Hopefully, we will never need to use all of these. But we are not compromising on preparations,” Chandra said, adding the government would also enhance the number of liquid medical oxygen tanks. As reported by STOI earlier, the government had completed special health screening of 35 lakh children and teenagers by mid-September. Only 0.3 per cent of them had Covid-19. Separate data from the Covid-19 war room shows that there have been more than 3.2 lakh cases, including 158 deaths, in the 0-19 age group. Overall, Karnataka has recorded nearly 29.7 lakh cases so far. The highest number of infections — over 6.8 lakh — have occurred in the 30-39 age group. The second-most affected group is 40-49 with 5.2 lakh cases. The highest number of Covid-19 deaths — 10,798 — has been reported in the 60-69 age category, followed by more than 8,000 fatalities in the 50-59 group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/third-covid-wave-2900-doctors-hired-in-karnataka-2000-more-to-join/articleshow/86522451.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Medical bills in crores: Ex-MLAs add to Punjab’s financial sickness||Ludhiana: If the figures provided by the Punjab Vidhan Sabha are true, former members of the legislative assembly were far costlier to the exchequer than the existing MLAs in claiming medical bills. Their expenses ran into crores of rupees. Right to Information (RTI) activist Rohit Sabharwal secured these details, which show that in last four years, the state government paid Rs 8.44 crore only as medical reimbursement to the existing and former MLAs. This included outdoor and indoor treatment, besides procedures for chronic diseases. Between April 1, 2017, and August 26, 2021, the current MLAs claimed Rs 1.35 crore as medical expenses, while the ex-MLAs claimed Rs 7.09 crore. The state has 268 ex-MLAs and 117 current legislators who draw this benefit. In the financial years 2017-18 and2018-19, the current lot claimed more than Rs 14.10 lakh and Rs 33.37 lakh, respectively, while in the 2019-20 and 2020-21 fiscals, the claims were Rs 49.98 lakh and Rs 36.55 lakh, respectively. Between April 1 and August 26 this year, the total bill is for Rs 1.09 lakh. In the 2017-18 and 2018-19 fiscals, the former MLAs claimed Rs 1.24 crore and Rs 1.27 crore, respectively. In the 2019-20 and 2020-21 fiscals, the claims were Rs 2.08 crore and Rs 2.08 crore, respectively. Between April 1 and August 26 this year, the reimbursed medical expenses were Rs 41.26 lakh. RTI activist Sabharwal expressed surprise that the former MLAs were claiming medical expenses in crores of rupees, putting a clear burden on the state exchequer. He said: “If the state is under debt, the MLAs should be setting an example in cost cutting and declining to claim these benefits.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/medical-bills-in-crores-ex-mlas-add-to-punjabs-financial-sickness/articleshow/86519036.cms||Nidhi Bhardwaj
---||Bengaluru||Covid-19 in Karnataka: Active cases below 15,000, first time since March||BENGALURU: Active Covid-19 cases in Karnataka have dipped below 15,000 for the first time since March 23, but the state continues to be among the regions with a high number of patients under treatment. Kerala leads the table with more than 1.6 lakh such patients, followed by Maharashtra (39,000). Maharashtra, in fact, is the only other state with over 25,000 active infections. Mizoram, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh are the other worst-affected states with an ongoing caseload of above 10,000 each. West Bengal and Odisha have a tally of 5,000 each. Six other states/UTs — Telangana, Assam, Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Manipur and Meghalaya — have an active caseload of above 1,000 but lower than 5,000. During the second wave of the pandemic, Karnataka breached the 6-lakh mark in active cases, which was the highest in the country. It faced severe criticism for being under-prepared to handle the situation as hundreds of people struggled to find hospital beds and oxygen in the April-May period. The number of active cases began to decrease slowly thereafter — as was expected given that Covid-19 has on average been claiming only around 2 per cent of those infected across the globe — and went below the 25,000-mark in the first week of July. At present, the number is under 13,500. On September 24, the figure was 13,306. And so far as preparations for the next possible wave go, health minister K Sudhakar said on Friday that the government was continuously working on enhancing medical infrastructure in the state. Pointing out that before Covid-19, there were only 725 ICU beds at government facilities — 413 in medical colleges and 312 in hospitals — he said that the same was increased to 1,961 during the second wave. And now, there are 3,877 such beds. “Before the pandemic, the state had a total of 4,847 oxygenated beds. Of these, 4,260 were in government medical colleges and 587 in government hospitals. The capacity was increased to 5,387 by the end of the first wave and to 25,184 by the second wave. As of August 2021, the number of oxygenated beds stood at 28,447,” Sudhakar added.

Party workers from Amritsar, led by Amritsar district (urban) unit president Tarsem Singh Bhola reached Jalandhar in three buses for a meeting at the state office of the BSP. The meeting was underway to give a memorandum addressed to the party supremo Mayawati. Party workers had to wait for quite sometime to see state office-bearers. However, soon after Bhola was sacked and a new district president was appointed. The memo signed by Bhola demanded for details on how the decision on original seat allocation and later the changes — which included giving Amritsar north, from where Anil Joshi has been declared party candidate, to SAD — was taken and when the local office-bearers were consulted on these issues. The memo also raised questions about giving tickets to leaders after inducting them from other parties. Bhola said they had not demanded seats from Amritsar and yet they were given, but now when seat was swapped with SAD and given to Joshi, they were not even kept in the loop. The memo also mentioned that it was being given through state party affairs in-charge Randhir Singh Beniwal and state president Jasbir Singh Garhi. When the big delegation was still here, Bhola was removed from his post and Tara Chand was appointed new district Amritsar unit president.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/bsp-asr-workers-question-seat-sharing-dist-prez-sacked-instantly/articleshow/86519082.cms||IP Singh
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Acquitted in triple murder case, financier kills wife||BENGALURU: A 40-year-old financier has been arrested for allegedly stabbing his wife to death in his house in Health Layout in Annapoorneshwarinagar on Wednesday evening. The trigger for the murder: She danced with her relatives during a family outing. Police have recovered a screwdriver, knife, two mobiles and one bike from the accused, BR Kantharaju. Roopa HG, 32, was found dead with multiple stab injuries on her neck inside the house. The couple has a seven-year-old boy. Roopa’s younger sister Latha HG had filed a complaint with Annapoorneshwarinagar police, accusing Kantharaju of murdering Roopa after suspecting her fidelity. Kantharaju had fled on his twowheeler soon after the incident. DCP (west) Sanjeev Patil said a special team led by inspector BN Lohit traced the accused. Kantharaju changed his hideout frequently and his mobiles were switched off. “Kantharaju was facing shortage of cash and had contacted a couple of his friends using his mobile. After each conversation, he would turn off the phone. On Friday, we learnt he was visiting a trader in Mahalakshmi Layout to take a loan. We waited near the trader’s house and arrested Kantharaju when he arrived there at night,” police said. Kantharaju told cops that he suspected Roopa of having an affair with two close family members. He grew more suspicious when he saw Roopa dancing with the duo during a family outing last week. “On September 19, 14 family members of Kantharaju and Roopa went on a three-day trip to Chikkamagalauru and surrounding areas. On Sunday, they stayed at a resort and everyone danced around the campfire. Kanathraju could not come to terms with the fact that his wife was dancing with two male members from the family,” sources said. After returning to Bengaluru on September 21, Kantharaju fought with Roopa on the issue. However, she is said to have chided him for suspecting her. She had maintained that theirs was a close-knit family and everyone was friendly. “But the fight resumed again on September 22. An enraged Kantharaju first stabbed Roopa’s neck with a screwdriver and then with a knife before fleeing. Kantharaju’s father Ramakrishna called Latha and others saying Roopa was found dead in the bedroom,” police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-acquitted-in-triple-murder-case-financier-kills-wife/articleshow/86522541.cms||---

The ministry of chemicals and fertilisers asked the UP chief secretary and the additional chief secretary of the industries department to start work on the project and compile a report before December 23. The medical device park, which is being planned over 350 acres, is expected to attract investments worth Rs 15,000 crore in the long run. In the first phase itself, officials are hoping to get Rs 5,200 crore of investments. The Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA), which will execute the project, had submitted its vision plan for the park with the Centre. In the proposal, YEIDA had highlighted the need for such a park, pointing out that UP had 46 medical colleges and 130 educational institutes that offered courses related to pharmaceuticals, bio-technology and medical studies. It had also said that NCR needed such a medical device park to supply equipment to neighbouring states. According to a rough estimate, more than 70% of medical devices, surgical supplies and equipment are imported from abroad. A total of 16 states and Union territories had shown interest in setting up the medical device park. Among them, the proposals of UP, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu were accepted and parks were approved in the four states. YEIDA has now approached Kalam Institute of Health Technology to prepare the detailed project report. “A common facility centre and allied infrastructure would be provided to all the entrepreneurs. The operational cost would be rationalised too. Subsidy will also be offered by the state government to those setting up units,” said Arun Vir Singh, the YEIDA CEO. YEIDA has already decided to develop the first phase of the project over 90 acres in Sector 28. It will also demarcate 89 plots that will be offered in the first phase. Officials said the park had to be made operational by March 2025 to claim the benefits and financial assistance being offered by the department of pharmaceuticals. YEIDA is working with IIT Kanpur and Noida International University for technology transfer programmes and improving the facilities that would be offered in the park. The Authority is expected to rake in Rs 1,000 crore of financial assistance from the central government once the park is operational.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/centre-nod-to-medical-device-park/articleshow/86519237.cms||Shalabh

The vast majority of Covid cases and hospitalisations are among the unvaccinated, she noted. State health officials on Friday rushed to roll out campaigns to provide booster shots for millions of vulnerable people who got the Pfizer-Bio-NTech vaccine and to help a confused public understand who qualifies for the extra shots. Among their challenges: making sure that recipients of the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines know that they are not yet eligible for boosters; reaching isolated elderly people; and informing younger adults with medical conditions or jobs that place them at higher risk that they might be eligible under the broad federal rules. “Those of us overseeing vaccine rollouts don’t have a clear idea of what to do,” said Dr. Clay Marsh, West Virginia’s Covid-19 czar. In his state, pharmacies sent staff members into the largest nursing homes Friday to administer booster doses. In Vermont, health officials opened booster shot appointments to people 80 and older on Friday, and said many other eligible people could get them starting next week. But the state said it was waiting for clarity from the CDC on which workers and medical conditions would qualify. In virus-battered North Dakota, officials struggling to make sense of the federal guidance delayed a broad booster rollout until next week. Across the country, vaccine providers are facing the reality that many more people became eligible for boosters after Walensky overruled her expert committee early on Friday. She said people at greater risk of exposure to the virus “because of occupational or institutional setting” would qualify, opening up boosters to millions of people her advisory committee had left out. People 65 and older and residents of long-term care facilities and adults who have certain medical conditions also qualify for the boosters. After Walensky’s announcement, President Biden said 20 million people could get boosters immediately because they had gotten their second Pfizer-Bio-NTech shot at least six months ago. “If you got the Pfizer vaccine in January, February, March of this year and you’re over 65 years of age, go get the booster,” Biden said. “Or if you have a medical condition like diabetes, or you’re a frontline worker, like a health care worker or a teacher, you can get a free booster now.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-booster-drive-kicks-off-amid-eligibility-confusion/articleshow/86522496.cms||---

According to police, the arrest was made in connection with alleged smuggling of 251kg cannabis with an estimated worth of Rs 50 lakh. As per the STF, the accused were identified as Firoz Khan (35), from Ghaziabad, Amit Sahni (30), Sachin Kumar (28), and Sonu (25), from Sonipat in Haryana; and Jitendra Kumar (30), and Mahesh Yadav (32), from Banda in UP. “Khan is a vegetable seller in Ghaziabad. The suspects used to bring narcotic products from Odisha and Andhra Pradesh and sell them in NCR,” a police officer said. Raj Kumar Mishra, DSP, Noida STF, told TOI that they received the information from a reliable source that the accused would smuggle marijuana in huge quantities from Lucknow to Surajpur on Friday. “The accused had come in a Mahindra pick-up van and a Maruti Swift Dzire car in Surajpur. They were transferring the marijuana packets from the pick-up van to the car when the police raided them. Our team recovered 250kg marijuana from their possession,” the DSP said. He added that during investigation, police came to know that Khan and his cousin Sadique alias Guddu — arrested by Chhattisgarh police some months ago — were involved in the smuggling. “They had visited Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh five years ago and bought marijuana from there. They sold the drug to local people in NCR for easy money. Khan then involved some other people and started smuggling cannabis from Odisha and Andhra Pradesh,” Mishra said. A case has been registered against them under sections 18 and 20 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985. The suspects were produced in a court on Saturday which sent them to the judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/noida-stf-police-bust-gang-of-marijuana-smugglers-6-arrested/articleshow/86519278.cms||---

The Greater Noida Authority on Saturday forwarded the detailed project report to the UP government for the final approval, after its board meeting. GNIDA wants to facilitate infrastructure and development work around Bodaki railway station in Dadri, where a new railway terminal has been planned. The Authority will develop skywalks, walkways, parking facilities and promote industrial and commercial growth, along with hotels and restaurants, in the region. CEO of the Authority, Narendra Bhooshan said, “The transport and logistics hub in the Dadri region will incentivise industrial growth of the entire town. We are taking steps to boost the infrastructure accordingly in the region.” Once ready, Bodaki will act as the transit hub for people travelling to eastern parts of Uttar Pradesh as well as Bihar and West Bengal. To decongest Delhi and Anand Vihar, several trains will originate from and terminate at Bodaki in the coming years, said GNIDA officials. Besides the railway station, a metro station and an interstate bus terminal has also been planned in Bodaki. The transport hub will be ready in the next five years, said GNIDA officials. In another important decision, six new sub-stations (220 kv to 400 kv) have been approved by the Greater Noida board. The new sub-stations will come up in sectors Ecotech 8, 10, 11, Knowledge Park-V, Amarpur and Jalpura, respectively. The board also gave approval to develop eight new industrial sectors in the city, which will be named Ecotech 7, 8, 9, 12A, 16, 19, 19A and 21. The Authority has already taken over 450 hectares of the total 900 hectares required to develop the new sectors. Meanwhile, private developers have been offered an extension of another six months to complete their project. The group housing projects that were to be completed by June 2021 has been given time till December 31 to complete work without paying any penalty for time extension, due to the second wave of the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/transport-hub-gr-noida-sends-dpr-to-govt-for-final-nod/articleshow/86519381.cms||Shalabh
---||Hubballi||Bharat Bandh will delay economic recovery: Basavaraj Bommai||HUBBALLI/MYSURU: Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai on Saturday appealed to farmers and left organisations not to support the Bharat Bandh on Monday as it will hamper the government’s efforts towards early recovery of the economy from the pandemic crisis. “Life is just getting back to normal in the state after being affected by the second wave of Covid-19. It’s not the time to hold a bandh when people are suffering from Covid. It will only delay the economic recovery,” Bommai said. The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), the umbrella body of over 40 farm unions leading the farmers’ agitation against the Centre’s three farm laws, has called for the nationwide strike on September 27, the day their ongoing protest completes 10 months. This is the second such bandh call given by SKM against the implementation of the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020. Farmers’ organisations, labour unions affiliated to various left parties and Dalit organisations are participating in the bandh. Only emergency services like ambulances and milk supply, medical services will be spared. Earlier in the day, some organisations in Mysuru made an appeal seeking support from the public for the bandh call even as representatives of some business communities, including hotel owners, opposed it. “We are still struggling to come out of the impact of Covid. We had no business for over seven months. This bandh call will further affect us. We’re working closely with farmers by buying vegetables, milk, etc. We will not extend support to this bandh,” said C Narayana Gowda, president of Mysuru District Hotel Owners’ Association. “It will affect thousands of families. So, we’re extending only external support to the bandh,’’ said BS Prashant, chairman, Federation of Mysuru Organisations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/bharat-bandh-will-delay-economic-recovery-basavaraj-bommai/articleshow/86522565.cms||---
---||Ghaziabad||6 lakh Ghaziabad vehicles may face HSRP fine next month||GHAZIABAD: With the Uttar Pradesh government in no mood to extend the September 30 deadline for installation of high-security registration plates (HSRPs), owners or drivers of nearly six lakh vehicles under the jurisdiction of the Ghaziabad regional transport department may face a Rs5,000 penalty from next month. Ghaziabad has a total of 10.30 lakh vehicles that are registered before April 2019, of which HSRPs have been installed on only 4.29 lakh, which is around 42%. On Saturday, Ghaziabad’s assistant regional transport officer (administration) Vishwajeet Pratap Singh said, “State principal secretary (transport) Rajeev Kumar held a video conference with RTO officials on September 24 where it was instructed that after the deadline for installing HSRP ends on September 30, fines will be imposed on erring vehicles from October 1 under the Motor Vehicle Act. A fine of Rs5,000 will be imposed on all vehicles without HSRPs from the next month. Successive fines will be imposed on a vehicle if caught by the transport department more than once.” According to officials, HSRPs are tamper-proof, as compared to the conventional number plates, and prevent counterfeiting of number plates. However, fewer people were coming forward to install HSRPs due to a lack of awareness. “The general impression is that like on previous occasions when we had extended the deadline, this time too, it will be deferred. But this cannot go on indefinitely,” Singh told TOI. Mahesh Mehlotra of Rosmerta HSRP Ventures Pvt Ltd, which is one of two companies entrusted with the job of making the plates, said, “For Ghaziabad, we have a capacity to make anything between 15,000 and 20,000 HSRPs daily. Unlike in December last year, when there was a rush and our capacity was low, we are comfortably placed in delivering plates in seven days.” To apply for HSRPs, vehicle owners, Singh said, will have to visit www.bookmyhsrp.com and select from the list of vehicles manufacturers, like TATA, Hyundai, Maruti, etc. They will then be direct to another page on the site where they have to select the state and the district. “The district list will display dealers from where the vehicle was bought. In the available format, a vehicle owner will have to fill in details, such as registration number and mobile number, etc and then make the payment. For cars, the fee is Rs 600 and two-wheelers Rs 300,” Singh added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/6l-gzb-vehicles-may-face-hsrp-fine-next-mth/articleshow/86519477.cms||Abhijay Jha

Accused Dhirendra Pratap Singh — who is posted with the AIIMS administration wing — was caught redhanded accepting Rs 1 lakh, CBI officers said. The ACB had received a complaint that Singh was demanding Rs 2 lakh to clear a pending bill of Rs 40 lakh from a medicine supplier and was causing ‘undue delay’ in sanctioning it while pressing for the bribe. After initial verification, the complainant was sent with dye-laced currency of Rs 1 lakh. Singh reportedly asked him to meet him outside a restaurant near Shahpura police station. As soon as Singh received the money, he was surrounded by the CBI team, led by DSP Atul Hajela. Inspectors Satish Barwal, Vijay Mehra, Sunil Gupta and Shilpa Sharma and sub-inspector Deep Sharma were part of the team. CBI probing multiple irregularities at AIIMSSingh’s residence and office were searched after his arrest. He will be produced in court on Sunday, said a CBI statement. Sources say CBI has been investigating multiple complaints against AIIMSBhopal, including allegations of irregularities in recruitment.

The workers, alleging non-payment of salaries, had submitted three complaints with the MCG. They had also been protesting at the MCG office for the past few days. The MCG has engaged Sai Enterprise to carry out the sweeping work (sanitation) in the area through a work order issued in June. The officials said they have been making monthly payments to the company as per the condition of the agreement and the company is responsible for the payment of salaries and wages to the sanitation workers. The sanitation workers are employed by the company. The sanitation workers alleged that the contractor is not paying for their work. They have further alleged that as and when they asked for their salaries the contractor abused and threatened them with dire consequences, including death to being expelled from service. “We have not been paid salaries for several months. The contractor gets abusive whenever anyone demands their salary,” said Ramrattan, a sanitation worker. Ashok and Sunil, both sanitation workers, said the contractor issued threats to those who demanded salary and terminated the service of sanitation workers without paying them. “Unable to get any response from the contractor, we were left with the only option to protest in front of the MCG office,” said Ashok. “MCG is making monthly payments to the contractor but he is not passing on the salaries to the sanitation workers. MCG has filed a complaint against the contractor,” said a sanitation officer of MCG, Bijender Sharma. Based on the complaint, a case was registered under section 406 (criminal breach of trust) IPC at Sadar police station. An MCG official said the corporation has opened an escrow account, to which the salaries of workers will be credited and the contractors will only be receiving their service charges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/wages-of-mcg-safai-workers-not-paid-contractor-booked/articleshow/86519633.cms||---

---||Ghaziabad||Ghaziabad: Dumpsites yet to be shifted, Raj Nagar residents move NGT||GHAZIABAD: Despite claims by the Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation that the dumping ground in the vicinity of Raj Nagar Extension has been shifted, residents allege that it is very much active. There are two places — near Moti Residence and Bhatt Road no 5 -- where the dumping grounds are active. Residents claim that as per rule, dumping grounds cannot operate near township while these dumping grounds are also near Hindon IAF base. The two dumping yards were started in May this year and after lodging several protests to close it down, residents have now filed a petition in the National Green Tribunal (NGT). Vikrant Sharma, a resident, said, “After GMC ran out of options for dumping civic waste at different places, the corporation opened the two dumping yards. We have seen the fate of townships such as Indirapuram and Sidharth Vihar where two dumping grounds existed in the past where tonne of waste were dumped over the years, so we didn’t want the same fate for Raj Nagar Extension, which is a new township. So, we lodged a protest with GMC. We have now approached the NGT when nothing was done.” The fact that the two dumping grounds are within 6km from Hindon IAF station makes its presence more dangerous. “Apart from health hazard to residents, the dumping ground attracts birds which pose risk to IAF planes that operate in the area and so IAF had also in the past objected to its, but GMC anyway went ahead with dumping waste at two sites,” Sharma added. Since the Pratap Vihar dumping ground closed on the orders of NGT in 2019, the GMC has been struggling to dispose of 1,200 MT waste that the city generates daily. Municipal Commissioner Mahendra Singh Tanwar said that the arrangements near Raj Nagar Extension was a temporary one and it will be closed once the waste to energy plant starts. “Three waste processing plants in Sihani, Ret Mandi and Indirapuram have started operation and this will take care of civic waste that is generated in the city. While in Sihani the plant can process 20 MT waste, in Ret Mandi plant it has a capacity to process 400MT waste and 600 MT waste can be processed in the Indirapuram plant,” he said. GMC is also aiming waste segregation at source. “With population the on rise, waste segregation at source is the need of the hour and on an average an individual generates anything between 350g to 400g of waste daily. If dry and wet waste is segregated at source, it will cut down waste generation by half,” he said. To cut down on waste, GMC has also enforced clauses of Solid Waste Management Rules 2016 in societies and establishments, which are considered bulk waste generators. As per rule any society or establishment with an area of 5,000sqm that generates civic waste more than 100kg a day must set up processing plants to segregate wet and dry waste.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/dumpsites-yet-to-be-shifted-raj-ngr-residents-move-ngt/articleshow/86519697.cms||Abhijay Jha
---||Gurgaon||If I cry today, I won’t be able to fulfil Devi Lal’s dream: Haryana deputy CM||NUH: “If there is any risk to MSP, I am ready to quit the government,” deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala told TOI on Saturday after a public meeting to celebrate the 108th birth anniversary of Devi Lal in Nuh’s Hilalpur village that was marked by the unveiling of a 42-foot-high statue of the former CM. It was a parallel event on a day Dushyant’s grandfather and INLD leader OP Chautala organised a mega rally in Jind to celebrate the legacy of Devi Lal and mark a ‘comeback’ into the Haryana political landscape after a long hiatus because of a 10-year prison sentence. Under pressure from farmers, his party’s main vote base, to quit and picketed out of his constituency in Jind for months, Dushyant continued to put up a brave face, saying the BJP-JJP government had government brought every single grain from farmers on minimum support price (MSP) and increased the number of mandis for trade. Citing direct benefit transfers to back accounts, he asked, ‘Has a single farmer objected to that? Nobody has. We assure that in future too.” Dushyant dismissed OP Chautala’s remarks, made in an interview to TOI, about mid-term polls becoming an increasing likelihood in Haryana. “I have been hearing this for a long time. First, they said the alliance will fall in two months, then they said 6 months, then a year, and later, a year and a half. But we have been running the government successfully for the last two years,” the JJP chief said. Asked why the event was held in Nuh, he said it was the only district where Devi Lal’s statue had not been installed. Earlier, Dushyant underlined the state government’s commitment to farmers, ensuring jobs for locals through 75% quota and other initiatives like ensuring job applicants get examination centres in their home districts. Dushyant said he had taken the protests in Jind, and his constituency Uchana Kalan, in his stride. “People will protest. They have the democratic right to show (black) flags. But if they break the law, there will be strict action,” he said. Accusing the 40 farmer leaders who form the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), which has been leading the protest against the three new central farm laws since last November, of spreading misinformation, Dushyant said, “It has been two years and two crop procurements have taken place. Has any mandi been affected? Has any farmer sold below MSP? No. There were misconceptions created by these (SKM) leaders.” He admitted that the farmers’ protest may have hurt his vote bank but said it has benefited him equally. “Crises and opportunities are the same word. I don’t see it as a crisis. If I cry today, I won’t be able to fulfil the dream of Devi Lal.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/if-i-cry-today-i-wont-be-able-to-fulfil-devi-lals-dream-says-dushyant/articleshow/86520235.cms||Sagrika Kissu

In the backdrop of the Maharashtra government allowing reopening of schools from October 4, she said that no decision on reopening of schools in Mumbai had been taken yet and that a final decision will be taken by the BMC in the next week. Pednekar said several factors will have to be considered before reopening of schools as the matter is about safety of children and citizens in general. “The civic administration has been closely monitoring the reports of those who have come back from the Ganpati festivities to gauge the situation. Seventy per cent of teachers have been vaccinated already, while the remaining we plan to vaccinate by undertaking special vaccination drives. Meetings have already begun to decide on the reopening of schools from Class 8-10. Even today, many teachers are coming to school, and we may decide to hold camps in specific areas to ensure everyone is vaccinated,” said Pedenkar, adding that this will ensure that teachers are safe and capable of handling the students. The mayor also said that when the city was in the danger zone, a decision was immediately taken to shut down schools. However, with the fear of the third wave having considerably reduced now, “by vaccinating as many people as fast as possible the administration will be taking steps to open up schools in such a manner that everyone’s safety is ensured,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/fear-of-a-fresh-covid-wave-considerably-reduced-says-mumbai-mayor-kishori-pednekar/articleshow/86522664.cms||Richa Pinto

A suspected dengue death was also reported in Ghaziabad though there has been no official confirmation from the health department yet. Fortunately, no new cases of malaria and scrub typhus were found in the tests conducted in the district on Saturday. So far, 17 cases of malaria and 39 cases of scrub typhus have been detected in Ghaziabad. Health officials say the worst-affected areas in the city are Pratap Vihar, Govindpuram and Harsau. “The maximum number of dengue has been reported from Govindpuram and Pratap Vihar, where we have intensified anti-larvae spray drive and are also in talks with RWAs for creating awareness about the diseases,” said GK Mishra, district malaria officer. Meanwhile, a suspected dengue death was reported in Ghaziabad. A 45-year-old woman resident of Sanjay Nagar reportedly died of ‘dengue shock syndrome’ at a private hospital on Friday. “The laboratory report of the woman is awaited,” said RK Gupta, district surveillance officer. The health department, on the other hand, with the help of civic agencies has intensified anti-larvae drives in affected areas. “We have called a meeting of civil defence and RWAs on Sunday, where we will create awareness about dengue and urge them to follow guidelines to crub the spread,” said Mishra. Experts, on the other hand, have warned that if proper measures are not taken, cases of dengue will rise. “A total of 621 cases were reported in 2016 and in winter, the disease will spread even more if the measures are not taken to check it,” said LK Mishra, a city-based doctor. “Apart from the extensive fogging, the administration must also impose a penalty on the households where larvae are detected.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/gzb-sees-17-new-cases-of-dengue/articleshow/86520065.cms||---

Moreover, around 150 have been sent to police lines for their alleged involvement in corrupt practices and for dereliction of duty. On Saturday too, SSP Pawan Kumar suspended two policemen after they were found taking bribe to let go of a truck with gas cylinders. The action was taken following a complaint made against the two cops — head constable Santosh Kumar and constable Harvinder Singh. A gas agency in Kavi Nagar lodged a complaint with the SSP stating that the two cops were taking bribes every month and had lately increased their demand, prompting the agency to stop the payments. On August 30, the cops allegedly asked for money and when refused, they took the truck to Govindpuram police chowki and only let it go once they got the amount. For comparison, as many as 70 cops were suspended and 720 were sent to the police lines under similar charges in whole of 2020 . While in 2019, the number was almost similar to 2020. A total of 71 cops were suspended and 359 were sent to the police line in that year. As per the police, 45% of cops were suspended in 2021 for their involvement in corruption while 40% were suspended for not doing their duty properly. This year, the action was initiated against 39 police personnel, including four inspectors, six sub-inspectors, 16 head constables, 12 constables and one clerk. Last year, seven inspectors, 14 sub-inspectors, 16 head constables, 27 constables, one computer operator, four constable drivers and one fourth grade officer were suspended under the charges of corruption and negligence in duty. In 2019, three inspectors, 13 sub-inspectors, 12 head constables and 43 constables were suspended. In 2019, a total of 155 inquiries were set up against the cops in which 125 police personnel were charged with misconduct while 30 were found innocent. In 2020, a total of 313 inquiries were done in which 249 were charged with misconduct while 64 were found innocent. This year, till September 25, a total of 221 inquiries were set up. A total of 120 cops were charged with misconduct, one given pay payment as punishment and 100 were found to be innocent. In case an inspector or a sub-inspector is given ‘misconduct’, will not be given any charge for the next three years. In the case of constables and head constables, increments stop for five years. “This year, the district police have received over 70 complaints related to corruption through email and courier, and all were disposed of,” he added. This year, 30% of the suspended officers are from the traffic department. They were found taking bribes from commuters. Also, 60% of officers, who were sent to the police lines, were found doing duty without their uniforms or being negligent in duty. In 2020, a UP Police Dial 112 constable, who helped a gang rob over 50 people on NH-9, was arrested along with his six associates. In 2019, SHO Laxmi Chauhan, sub-inspector Naveen Kumar Pachauri and five constables were found to be involved in a Rs 70 lakh theft and suspended,||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/crackdown-on-corruption-39-cops-suspended-150-shunted-this-year/articleshow/86520103.cms||---
---||World||Russia says it is in sync with US, China, Pakistan on Taliban||UNITED NATIONS: Russia, China, Pakistan and the United States are working together to ensure that Afghanistan's new Taliban rulers keep their promises, especially to form a genuinely representative government and prevent extremism from spreading, Russia's foreign minister said Saturday. Sergey Lavrov said the four countries are in ongoing contact. He said representatives from Russia, China and Pakistan recently traveled to Qatar and then to Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, to engage with both the Taliban and representatives of “secular authorities” — former president Hamid Karzai and Abdullah Abdullah, who headed the ousted government's negotiating council with the Taliban. Lavrov said the interim government announced by the Taliban does not reflect “the whole gamut of Afghan society — ethno-religious and political forces — so we are engaging in contacts. They are ongoing.” The Taliban have promised an inclusive government, a more moderate form of Islamic rule than when they last ruled the country from 1996 to 2001 including respecting women's rights, providing stability after 20 years of war, fighting terrorism and extremism and stopping militants from using their territory to launch attacks. But recent moves suggest they may be returning to more repressive policies, particularly toward women and girls. “What's most important ... is to ensure that the promises that they have proclaimed publicly to be kept,” Lavrov said. “And for us, that is the top priority.” At a wide-ranging news conference and in his speech afterward at the UN General Assembly, Lavrov criticized the Biden administration including for its hasty withdrawal from Afghanistan. He said the US and NATO pullout “was carried out without any consideration of the consequences ... that there are many weapons left in Afghanistan.” It remains critical, he said, that such weapons aren't used for “destructive purposes.” Later, in his assembly speech, Lavrov accused the United States and its Western allies of “persistent attempts to diminish the UN's role in resolving the key problems of today or to sideline it or to make it a malleable tool for promoting someone's selfish interests." As examples, Lavrov said Germany and France recently announced the creation of an Alliance For Multilateralism “even though what kind of structure could be more multilateral than the United Nations?” The United States is also sidestepping the UN, he said, pointing to the recent US announcement of a “Summit for Democracy" despite, Lavrov said, US President Joe Biden's pledge this week “that the US is not seeking a world divided into opposing blocs.” “It goes without saying that Washington is going to choose the participants by itself, thus hijacking the right to decide to what degree a country meets the standards of democracy,” Lavrov said. “Essentially, this initiative is quite in the spirit of a Cold War, as it declares a new ideological crusade against all dissenters.” Lavrov was asked for Russia's reaction to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' warning last week that the world could be plunged into a new Cold War potentially more dangerous than the lengthy one between the US and the former Soviet Union unless the United States and China repair their “totally dysfunctional” relationship. He replied: “Of course, we see the tension tightening in relations between China and the United States." He expressed “great concern" at the rising tensions, pointing to the Biden administration's recently proclaimed Indo-Pacific strategy — whose objectives, he said, include “deterring China's development,” disputes over the South China Sea, and the recent US-Britain deal to provide nuclear-powered submarines to Australia. More broadly, Lavrov said, relations among the big powers must be “respectful." He emphasized that Russia was “keen to ensure that never will these relations morph into nuclear war.” The major powers have a “great responsibility,” he said, to negotiate and make compromises on the critical issues facing the world and that Russia is now “revitalizing” its proposal for a summit of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council — Russia, China, US, UK and France. He said discussions are under way on specific questions for an agenda, and “we may perhaps begin with an online meeting.” On other global issues, the United States has been pressing for Iran to resume nuclear negotiations, but Lavrov said it was then-President Donald Trump who pulled the US out of the nuclear agreement, so to declare that “time is running out, anybody could say this — but not Washington.” In his first speech to the General Assembly earlier this week, new Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi criticized the United States but appeared not to rule out a return to the negotiating table for the nuclear accord, saying Iran considers talks useful if their ultimate outcome is the lifting of all sanctions. Still, he stated: “We don't trust the promises made by the US government.” Lavrov said Russia would like to see the resumption of negotiations to restore the original agreement as soon as possible. “We have a very serious hope -- and I think this is well-founded optimism -- that we will achieve results," he said, because “this is something everybody wants."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/russia-says-it-is-in-sync-with-us-china-pakistan-on-taliban/articleshow/86522752.cms||---
