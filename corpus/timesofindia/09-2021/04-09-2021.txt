Jaishankar thanked Plenkovic for receiving him at Zagreb and said that they also discussed "pressing global issues", including the situation in Afghanistan. "Thank Prime Minister @AndrejPlenkovic for warmly receiving me in Zagreb. Discussed opportunities to further expand our bilateral cooperation including in Pharma, Digital and Infrastructure. Appreciate his insights on pressing global issues, especially Afghanistan," Jaishankar said on Twitter. He arrived in Zagreb after completing his two-day visit to Slovenia, during which he held bilateral meetings with his Slovenian counterpart Anze Logar, apart from calling on the country's top leadership. During his visit to Croatia, the external affairs minister will hold bilateral talks with foreign minister Gordan Grlic Radman, and call on the Croatian leadership. The Taliban seized power in Afghanistan on August 15, two weeks before the US' complete troop withdrawal on August 31 after a costly two-decade war. This forced Afghan President Ashraf Ghani to flee the country to the UAE. The Taliban insurgents stormed across Afghanistan and captured all major cities in a matter of days, as Afghan security forces trained and equipped by the US and its allies melted away. Thousands of Afghan nationals and foreigners have fled the country to escape the new Taliban regime and to seek asylum in different nations, including the US and many European nations, resulting in total chaos and deaths.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/s-jaishankar-meets-croatian-pm-discusses-bilateral-ties-and-afghanistan/articleshow/85910168.cms||---
---||Bhubaneswar||‘Next major task is to connect alumni with alma mater through our mobile app’||Akash Das Nayak, chief of the government’s Mo College initiative, speaks to Minati Singha on transforming colleges into quality higher educational institutesHow has the progress of the Mo College initiative been so far?It was formally launched by chief minister Naveen Patnaik in March. A total of 755 government and government-aided universities, degree colleges and professional institutes have been included in the scheme and Mo College committees have also been formed to ensure its execution.  What will be your next course of action?The next major task is to connect the alumni with the colleges and universities they passed out from. Many of them hold plum positions in their workplaces or in society and are keen to give back or support their alma mater. We want to bring all of them under the Mo College umbrella. We are also developing a mobile app, which will help connect them easily. How can someone contribute to the development of his or her college?There are three types of contributions — financial, academic or intellectual and industry connect. For any financial contribution, the state government will provide double its amount to the institute concerned. Former students can provide academic support by taking online classes or participating in webinars or giving expert advice as part of our ‘Meet the Alumni’ programme that every college is planning to conduct once a month. The third and final contribution is through industry connect through which the alumni will held the students of their college get exposure. What are the major areas of concern?I feel there is no dearth of talent in Odisha, but there is a lack of self-confidence in youngsters owing to no proper guidance in terms of counselling and skill training. We have planned to set up polishing schools to develop their soft skills and personalities. Our youngsters are full of energy. So it is very important to give them the right exposure. The Mo College aims to do that. Besides, we are also focusing on the digitisation of institutions and on other such steps to attract students to libraries and playgrounds. Mo School, which is an alumni connect initiative for schools, has received a very good response. Do you think the progress of Mo College has been less compared to the former?There can’t be any comparison between the two initiatives because their objective is the same — to give back to the alma mater. Mo School started four years before us and has done extremely well. We are learning from them and taking help wherever needed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/next-major-task-is-to-connect-alumni-with-alma-mater-through-our-mobile-app/articleshow/85910654.cms||Minati Singha

He, however, added that they must strictly follow the Covid-19 protocols while in the lake. Two other tourist destinations, the Gopalpur and Pati Sonepur beaches, which were also shut since the same day as the Tampara, were opened about a month ago. Sources said the Tampara remained shut until now to facilitate construction work. Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan had inaugurated the lake view park of the Tampara on March 19. The project was implemented under the Centre’s Swadesh Darshan scheme. The water-sports facility in the vast water body was introduced in the lake last year by the tourism department under PPP mode. The infrastructure of the water body was severely damaged in Cyclone Phailin, which had hit the district on October 12, 2013.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/tampara-reopens-after-four-months/articleshow/85910587.cms||Hrusikesh Mohanty

The victim, Rajinder Kumar Chawla was working with Aecom, one of the world’s largest consultancy firms. Many are concerned that the incident will have an impact on the construction industry. This is perhaps the first instance of the managing director of a construction company being arrested for killing an NHAI engineer supervising its project, though there have been instances of construction companies threatening and manhandling consulting engineers and getting physical, industry sources said. Jaipur Police on Friday arrested Karandeep Sheoran, head of E5 Infrastructure Pvt Ltd and four others. Sources in NHAI said E5 is a sister concern of Gawar Construction Ltd, which has emerged as a major player in recent years. “The government must take stern actions against the killers and others responsible for this. Independent consultants are government’s representatives and they protect public interest. They must get protection from the government so that they can continue performing their duties independently and in public interest,” said Raj Kumar, CMD of Rodic Consultants. K K Kapila, chairman of the business practices committee of the Consulting Engineers Association of India said the contracting and consulting industry are two pillars. “This incident is shocking. We hope the investigation will be completed expeditiously and this is unacceptable to any industry,” he added. Chawla, had started his career as an engineer in Haryana’s PWD and also worked in NHAI and NHIDCL on deputation for more than five years. After retirement, he joined the consultancy firm. “He was an upright engineer. The consulting engineers are duty-bound to work without any bias and fear. He was involved in several projects including one of the most difficult projects of flyover and cloverleaf at Badarpur border in Delhi,” said one of Chawla’s colleagues. The Gurgaon-based engineer is survived by his wife and two children, who are settled abroad. The consultancy firm (Aecom) is likely to withdraw from the project. E5 Infrastructure was established in 2015. The company website says it is executing 13 projects including the emergency landing facility on Srinagar-Banihal NH stretch and additional structures in Delhi-Agra stretch of NH. The list of its clients include NHAI, road transport ministry, NHIDCL, Indian Railways and Airport Authority of India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/murder-of-gurgaon-based-project-engineer-sends-shock-waves-in-construction-industry/articleshow/85910808.cms||Dipak K Dash
---||India||Infer instigation from circumstances too says Bombay high court, denies bail to man for minor niece’s ‘suicide’||MUMBAI: Instigation can have no straitjacket formula and must be inferred from circumstances of a case said Justice Bharati Dangre of Bombay high court denying bail to a married man accused of abetting suicide of his minor niece and of sexually harassing and assaulting her. The case from Pune, depicts a "woeful and dismal picture" said the HC. Justice Dangre said , a child, her adolescent years shaped by harrowing experience and irreparable memories, a fear of stigma, of not being believed and being blamed, found herself in a precarious situation, isolated and insecure which persuaded her to end her life. The accused, a matured married man, deserves no liberty, also because as a kin he may pressurize prosecution witness and tamper with the case, said the HC order of September 1. She was just 17, when her life ended. A hand-written paper that her mother found a day after her child “jumped’’ from their balcony has since been haunting her. "Mummy, I have not told you about one person. ABC (name withheld to not disclose identity) uncle in our house. For no reason, he often come(s) close to me and attempted to touch my private parts. I concealed the same from you and that was my mistake" it said. The teen breathed her last 41 days after being rushed to the hospital where when asked why she took the extreme step she had murmured her paternal uncle’s name. The hospital at the time was told that she fell from the fourth floor gallery while removing a towel. The grief stricken mother, filed the first information report (FIR) against the kin more than three months later, after the family first mused whether to proceed against him as he is a "close relative" and a "powerful person." The police lodged a case under section 306 Indian Penal Code, sections 354 A (Sexual harassment) IPC as well as sections 4 and 8 (sexual assault) of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO). The chit that the mother preserved and the HC order reproduced also said that the girl feared the family might quarrel if she disclosed that her uncle was texting her "about bad things". She had stored screen shots in her mobile phone where on one of her photos, he had written "you are looking very hot" and in another he wanted to speak with her privately, and her response that he was like her father, to which he asked her to "clear chat." "I have blocked him but yesterday night, he texted me. I was unable to understand what I should do and how should I disclose it…you and Papa should not fight. Bye…take care… Even though I blocked him on mobile, I will have to face him some day…no matter how much I tolerate, I will be blamed," said her note. She had confided in a friend though, who in turn asked her mother whether she knew about the "dirty messages" and who the sender was. The mother asked her daughter and that was the night she "jumped". Shocked, the mother said she had fainted. The counsel for the accused said the allegation is of "an attempt" and not of actual touching and denying the allegations against him, argued at best it was a "moral blunder". Also, the note discloses no intention of suicide and citing the Supreme Court order in Arnab Goswami’s case, argued that in the absence of any acts attributed to the man accused, how can he be held responsible for abetment of suicide. The girl’s unfortunate extreme step has to be viewed from a prudent, not an over sensitive mind, argued the counsel and adding that chargesheet is already filed, his continued custody is not warranted. Justice Dangre said the note was written a "few hours before she took the extreme step and is an expression of despair and her anguish. It reflects her desperation and pain." "She is a girl in formative years and her writing gives an impression that she feels trapped. It is possible that any other girl in similar circumstances would have responded to the situation in a different way," said the HC order adding however, "but given that the accused is her own uncle, she displayed absolute inhibition to embroil him in accusation." The Judge said, the "case is of a young teenage girl, who felt cornered by the conduct and demeanor of her own uncle, which was unexpected since she held him on a high pedestal as her own father and was unable to vent her anguish on account of the close proximity of the family with that of the applicant. She suffered the consequences mutely for a year or so." In abetment of suicide, instigation requires a reasonable certainty to incite and depends on intention of person who abets said the court. And added that while it is also true that words uttered in a fit of anger or omission cannot be considered to be instigation. "It is possible that there may not be direct evidence to instigation which may bear a direct nexus to suicide." Inference will have to be drawn from "surrounding circumstances" to see if "a person felt totally frustrated and committed suicide." The HC said, "From the note, it is apparent that her harassment continued and the message of Good Night do not appear to be a solitary and innocuous one." Justice Dangre said, "Sexual violence knows no boundaries. It occurs in every country, across all parts of society. A child may be subjected to sexual abuse or exploitation at home too. The widespread use of digital technology can also put children at risk," adding "Unfortunately, we have not been able to create an atmosphere in the society where parents, teachers and adults in company of the child can identify signs of abuse and make sure children receive care and protection."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/infer-instigation-from-circumstances-too-says-bombay-high-court-denies-bail-to-man-for-minor-nieces-suicide/articleshow/85911254.cms||Swati Deshpande

Based on a complaint by Malleswaram resident Teju G Shankar, Cubbon Park police station registered an FIR against 10 persons under IPC sections 406 (criminal breach of trust) 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant, or by banker, merchant or agent) and 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property). Teju and her advocate-husband Preetam Nelson D Costa said on August 19, they visited the showroom and booked a car for Rs 13.9 lakh. “A sales executive from the showroom said the SUV would be delivered on August 25. We visited the showroom by 4.30pm that day to pick up the car and and the in-charge sales executive was explaining the features of the SUV to us when we noticed a dent on the right backdoor. The same was brought to the notice of all staff concerned, including the senior quality manager,” they said. Showroom officials remained incommunicado: CoupleAccording to the couple, the showroom officials emailed them saying they will replace the dented door panel with a new one. “We declined to accept delivery of the SUV and demanded that a new vehicle of the same brand be provided to us. We tweeted our request to the CEO, explaining the situation. Our vehicle is still in the showroom and they are not ready to deliver a new one. They have remained incommunicado. We have requested legal action against the accused persons,” the couple said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/dent-in-new-car-advocate-files-plaint-against-showroom-maker/articleshow/85911296.cms||---

He lodged a complaint with the airline and Kolkata airport authority and a probe is under way. Chandan Prakash, 35, employee of an American multinational retail chain in Bengaluru, flew to Kolkata on August 20 to celebrate Raksha Bandhan with his sister. He returned by IndiGo flight 6E 875 on August 22 and went to his HSR Layout residence from KIA. “I landed on Sunday, collected my trolley bag and went home. When I opened it the next morning, I spotted an unusual tear inside the bag. Someone had cut the fabric from inside to access contents after opening the outer compartment,” Prakash said. He emailed a complaint to the airline about a possible theft post check-in. He also shared his experience on social media with photographs and videos of his black bag. IndiGo airlines replied that it couldn’t initiate action like compensation as he hadn’t lodged a complaint at the baggage delivering area on arrival. Prakash said: “The reply was ridiculous as there was no visible damage to my bag. Someone had opened the top pouch and cut through the inner fabric to access stuff inside. I didn’t lose anything valuable and I don’t need compensation but this must be probed and culprits brought to book.” Some airlines have discontinued sealing outer compartments of check-in bags with plastic wire locks. Theft bid may have occurred at Kolkata airport: Airline Airline representatives investigated the matter and said the theft attempt may have taken place at Kolkata airport. Airport officials confirmed a probe is under way as some other passengers had complained of similar problems. After Prakash’s complaints gained traction on social media, IndiGo approached him. “It sent me a new trolley bag and urged me to take down my social media post but I refused. I said I didn’t need compensation but closure. I’m glad an investigation is on,” he added. IndiGo airlines told TOI Prakash has been suitably compensated and the incident is being probed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/techies-check-in-baggage-cut-in-flight-from-kolkata/articleshow/85911297.cms||Petlee Peter
---||World||UK MPs warn Afghan soil could be used for terror training under pressure from Pakistan ‘deep state’||LONDON: A UK parliamentary group made up of cross-party MPs focused on the Indo-Pacific has issued a statement expressing grave concern that the Taliban may allow terrorist training camps to re-mobilise on Afghan soil under pressure from the "deep state of neighbouring Pakistan" and "other militant hardline Islamist groups like LeT and JeM". The statement by the APPG (all-party parliamentary group) Indo-Pacific warns this could lead to a rise in the recruitment of hardline Islamists in the name of jihad. "India, in particular, is concerned about any impact of the Afghan fallout on the rise in terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir," the statement by British MPs says. It calls on India, the UK, US, and other like-minded democracies to formulate a collective mid-long-term response to the fallout of the Taliban takeover to prevent a catastrophe and disastrous consequences for peace and security in the Indo-Pacific. The APPG calls on the international community to not release funding to the Afghan Taliban until there is commitment from the Taliban to honour the principles of democratic governance. "There should be diplomatic pressure on the Taliban, as they seek some sort of recognition from the world community, to work with other stakeholders to decide the future of the Afghan people," it states. It also expresses concern that schools and colleges in Afghanistan, where girls were getting a good education, have virtually all closed down and that women are scarcely to be seen on the streets anymore. "The Taliban have officially told women to stay indoors as they believe their fighters are not trained to deal with women," the statement reads. "There is also the resistance in Panjshir, where Ahmed Masood and Amrullah Saleh have clearly not recognised the Taliban. All of this points to a period of uncertainty and darkness for months and years to come," it warns.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/uk-mps-warn-afghan-soil-could-be-used-for-terror-training-under-pressure-from-pakistandeep-state/articleshow/85911332.cms||NAOMI CANTON
---||World||Taliban likely to form government today, fighting, protests continue against them||ISLAMABAD: Amid mounting domestic and international pressure, the Taliban have delayed the formation of the new government in war-battered Afghanistan by a day, the group’s spokesman said on Friday. The new government, according to Taliban sources, will be headed by the group’s co-founder, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar. Mullah Mohammad Yaqoob, the son of late Taliban chief Mullah Muhammad Omar, and Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai, Taliban sources added, are the two other senior Taliban leaders to be appointed to senior positions. Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada, the Taliban chief, will focus on religious matters and governance within the framework of Islam. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said that the government will now be formed on Saturday. Earlier, it was claimed that the government would be announced after Friday prayers. As all eyes were glued to TV stations, protests were held by groups of Afghan women and civil society activists in Kabul calling for their inclusion in the future government. The Taliban have already stated that women will be allowed to work in government institutions but not in higher-ranking positions. The protesters urged the Taliban and the international community to protect the political, social and economic rights of women that they had achieved in the last two decades. "No society will make progress without women’s active role," civil society activist Taranum Saeedi said. As women continued their rallies in Kabul and other parts of the country, videos posted on social media showed some Taliban members in front of a government building forcing them to call off their protest. All the top Taliban leaders are said to be currently in Kabul. While the EU, Britain and the US have declared that they will deal with the Taliban but won’t recognise them, Pakistan said on Friday that its approach towards the group has to be different and realistic. "Some have the choice of getting up and leaving, but we do not. We are neighbours and we have to coexist. Geography ties us together so our approach to the Taliban has to be somewhat different and realistic," Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said at a joint news conference with British foreign secretary Dominic Raab, who had arrived in Islamabad on a two-day visit on Thursday. Explaining the UK’s approach to the Taliban, Raab said: "The approach we are taking is that we don’t recognise the Taliban as a government but we do see the importance of being able to engage and have a direct line of communication, the reason being that there is a whole range of issues that need to be discussed, including the question of safe passage of British nationals and the Afghans who worked for the UK government." On the other hand, Doha-based Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen announced that China has promised to keep its embassy in Afghanistan open and to increase humanitarian aid to the war-ruined country. China has also issued a statement saying that it "affirms" its ties with Afghanistan and that it wishes Afghans well as they rebuild their country. Meanwhile, intense fighting continues between the Taliban and the resistance force in Afghanistan’s Panjshir Valley, northeast of the capital Kabul, as both sides claimed to have inflicted heavy losses on each other. Smoke could be seen billowing from the distant mountains as the Taliban engaged in a battle to take control of the last of the country’s 34 provinces. The fighting had intensified on Tuesday after attempts at a negotiated settlement failed. The Taliban claim of taking some territory was rejected by the National Resistance Force (NRF), a multi-ethnic group made up of militias and former Afghan security force members, saying it has control over all entrances to the valley, and the invading militant group had lost hundreds of fighters. The NRF is led by a local tribal leader, Ahmad Massoud, a 32-year-old graduate of Kings College London and Sandhurst Military Academy. Massoud’s father, Ahmad Shah Massoud, had held off the Red Army of the former Soviet Union in the 1980s and the Taliban in the 1990s. The young Massoud was joined in Panjshir by the country’s former vice-president, Amrullah Saleh, after the Taliban seized control of Kabul. Locals in districts adjacent to Panjshir said that days before the fall of Kabul on August 15, they had seen former Afghan National Army soldiers from the provinces of Kunduz, Baghlan, Kapisa, Parwan and Takhar heading towards Panjshir after those provinces surrendered to the Taliban. Those soldiers, as witnessed by local residents, were transporting military vehicles and equipment. Former Afghanistan president Hamid Karzai has called on Taliban and resistance forces in the Panjshir Valley to lay down their arms and engage in peaceful dialogue. Karzai, who led the nation from 2001 to 2014, tweeted that "despite the efforts of the reformers, military operations and fighting have started in Panjshir". "I do not consider the consequences to be in the interest of the country and the people," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/taliban-likely-to-form-government-today-fighting-protests-continue-against-them/articleshow/85911451.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

While the terrorists managed to escape towards Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, a subsequent search of the area led security forces to find assorted items with “markings” indicating they were made in Pakistan. On August 30, the Army had shot dead two terrorists while they were trying to clandestinely enter India. On detecting the infiltration attempt by the ultras late Thursday, the Indian soldiers manning the LoC challenged the suspects and a fierce gunfight ensued. “They took advantage of the darkness owing to undulating terrain and heavy undergrowth and managed to flee towards PoK,” Jammu-based defence spokesperson Lt Col Devender Anand said. “The troops carried out a thorough search of the encounter site and recovered an assortment of administrative stores left behind by the terrorists, including clothing, packaged food items and medicines with Pakistani markings,” Lt Col Anand added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/army-foils-infiltration-bid-in-poonch-recovers-items-with-pak-markings/articleshow/85911762.cms||Sanjay Khajuria
---||Goa||AIFF gets Central Asian invite, Asean is next||Panaji: India will continue to remain with the South Asian Football Federation (SAFF) despite the Central Asian Football Association (CAFA) agreeing to include them in their competitions from next year. SAFF has already lost Afghanistan who moved to CAFA in 2015, but India has told regional officials that they are not going anywhere. “India is an important member of SAFF. We are not moving anywhere,” All India Football Federation (AIFF) general secretary Kushal Das told TOI on Friday. Speculation on India’s ‘move’ to CAFA started after its executive committee agreed to include AIFF in their competitions starting from 2022. “The committee agreed to include AIFF in CAFA competitions starting from 2022. They will also consider the potential participation of the AIFF youth national teams in CAFA competitions this year,” the federation said in a statement. The decision to include India in their competitions is a result of an official request from AIFF to CAFA secretary Ulugbek Karimov on July 30. In his letter, Das said AIFF wishes to explore the possibility of signing a Memorandum of Understanding with CAFA to foster a long-term relationship that will allow India’s men’s, women’s and the age-group teams to participate in all of CAFA’s official competitions as invitational teams. CAFA nations include Iran, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan and Afghanistan. “We hope this arrangement will help players of both AIFF and the members of CAFA to improve their skills and will provide adequate international exposure which will help them perform better in the future,” Das wrote in his letter. Last year, AIFF had approached the ASEAN Football Federation seeking an invitation to participate in their youth competitions, including all junior boys events, AFF women’s championship and AFF U-16 girls championship. Amongst others, Association of Southeast Asian Nations includes rising football nations like Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines and Singapore. “Our aim is to get the best exposure for our national teams,” said a senior official from the AIFF. “The response from Aff was positive but we were stuck due to the Covid-19 pandemic. As and when Aff approves our request, our teams will take part in their competitions as well.” AIFF, though, has made it clear that the participation is subject to any and all prior scheduled commitments like SAFF tournaments and/or Fifa and AFC matches.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/aiff-gets-central-asian-invite-asean-is-next/articleshow/85911061.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

Milkha Singh, one of India's greatest-ever athletes, missed out on a bronze medal during the 1960 Olympics held in Rome. He passed away due to Covid-19 complications in June this year. Inaugurated in 2014 for the Lusofonia Games, the venue was not officially named but often referred to as the GMC athletics stadium. Several matches of last season’s Indian Super League (ISL) were played here. Other venues built for the Lusofonia Games and the oft-postponed National Games are waiting to be named. “We will consider naming the stadiums after Goan sportspersons who have contributed for many years,” said Sawant. “The names of Leo Pinto, Walter D’Souza and Mary D’Souza are being considered for stadiums which are not yet named. This is the right time to do it. We are celebrating 60 years of Goa’s Liberation and we must move ahead in all fields.” While Leo Pinto and Walter D’Souza were part of India’s gold medal-winning team at the 1948 London Olympics, Mary D’Souza is among the first Indian women to compete in Olympics. She won gold, silver and bronze medals at the Asian Games in Delhi (1951) and at Manila Games in 1954. Sawant also announced that the state government will soon sign a memorandum of understanding with the Sports Authority of India (SAI) for its centre of excellence at Campal. The centre will cater to table tennis, badminton and swimming. An annual budget of Rs 3 crore has been earmarked. “In Dhargal, we have 100 acres of land. We want to create a Sports City there. Due to the pandemic, we could not move ahead with our plans. But our vision is to have a Sports City. Land has been reserved and by 2023 we should have an academy for sports with the best facilities,” said Sawant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/athletics-stadium-to-be-named-after-milkha-sawant/articleshow/85911874.cms||---

Carrying multiple sizes of the same design to the trial room in the hope that one of them will fit you perfectly, figuring out how the sizes change from brand to brand and sometimes having to alter clothes – all this might soon change, thanks to the India size project. This national sizing survey project was finally launched in Delhi fourteen years after its inception. How participants are measuredParticipants walk through a 3D scanner and the measurements are noted. From each participant, 100 anthropometric data is collected. You can participate in the India size projectAs part of the research, 25,000 men and women in the age group of 15- 65 years from Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad, Kolkata and Shillong will be measured using non-contact 3D body scanning technology. Since July 2021, NIFT Delhi has collected data from over 5,000 people as part of the first leg of the data collection. The ongoing study has representation from various age groups, income index, and origin to collate a standard size chart. We visited the kiosk set up in a south Delhi mall where curious shoppers had many questions for the staff members who were explaining how the data collection works. One shopper asked, “Does it mean only those who are on heavier side will be considered in India sizing?” Another shopper told us, “It’s a familiar problem for women. The reason is that standard international sizing has nothing standard about it.” ‘Shoppers and the apparel industry both will be happy once the size is created’Officials who were present at the launch explained the project and said that once India size is created, shopping will become more convenient. In 2007, NIFT had started discussion around this project and it was restarted in 2019 with the deadline of a 2021 launch. Shantmanu, Director General, NIFT, says, “This is a scientific exercise where anthropometric data is collected from a sample population, using 3D scanner technology, in order to create a standardised size chart. This will follow all international protocols of national sizing survey and will be a true representative of the Indian population, which can then be adopted by the apparel industry.” The first-of-its-kind survey in India will capture more than 100 anthropometric data points from each participant. Upendra Prasad Singh, Secretary, Ministry of Textiles, says, “The survey will result in the creation of a size identification number for a customer through mapping, categorization and defining of their body size. This will help manufacturers to produce goods suited for the body size of the target consumer and help consumers to identify sizes that will be best suited for them, resulting in a match and hence improved sales. Apart from apparel, the findings of the study will also have applications across various other industries where the insights from this data can produce ergonomically-designed products which are well suited for the Indian population.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-shoppers-give-3d-measurements-for-india-size-project/articleshow/85903475.cms||Niharika Lal
---||Delhi||Chopaan Kebab, Uzbaki Kabuli Pulao & Naan: Afghani flavours on Dilli’s platter||Afghan restaurants, street food joints and bakeries in Lajpat Nagar’s quaint Kabul Colony, are cooking up a gastronomic storm with an interesting array of dishes that are gently teasing Delhi’s taste buds. Afghani food known for its exquisite taste has also ensured a livelihood for many Afghans living in Delhi. We recently took a delicious food walk through the lanes of Kabul Colony, where eateries serve authentic Afghan food. While Afghan food is primarily non-vegetarian, it also relies a lot on dairy, rice and grains. It is also packed with nuts and dried fruits, especially pine khajoor nuts and khajoor. This multi-faceted cuisine is said to have been influenced by cuisines from central Asia, Iran, China and India. The many varieties of breadKabul Colony is dotted with eateries selling different versions of Afghan naan. A vendor explains, “There are two types of naan, round and square. These are prepared in clay tandoors in batches.” While the Afghan naan is a staple food of Afghanistan, bread and rice dishes are culturally vital parts of Afghani cuisine. Uzbaki Kabuli Pulao is a favourite dish of Afghanistan. It’s prepared by adding meat to rice and topped with fried raisins, caramelised carrots, fruits and pistachio. Sambosa, the Afghan version of samosa, filled with meat and Bolani, a bread stuffed with potato and served with chutney, are also popular here. The round, sweet naan called Roht is prepared with khus seeds and served with Sheer Chai. Other popular varieties of naan available are Khasa, Gir, Khajoori, Roghni Naan and Lavasa. Another dish that one has to sample here is the Afghani burger. It is a flatbread made with wheat flour and filled with layers of cabbage, tomato, cucumber, shredded chicken (or sausages), boiled eggs, fried potatoes and topped with red chutney. ‘Non-spicy, simple flavours’Afghan food is known to be appetising, delectable, yet subtly flavoured. Irshad, who works at a restaurant known for its Afghani delicacies, says, “Afghani dishes have simple flavours and are non-spicy. In pre-pandemic days, our kitchens used to be busy till midnight. The good news is that the foodies are returning.” Afghanistan’s delicacies come from different regions – Chopaan Kebab is a Pashtun delicacy, while the Qaburghi Kebabs are from Qandahar and Herat. MantuMantu: Dumplings stuffed with meat and onions, topped with yogurt and chana dal chutney The Uzbaki Kabuli Pulao and Qorma Chalao/Korma Challaw (Afghani style chicken curry) are sometimes served with a complimentary helping of rajma, roti and roasted baingan with  dahi at some eateries. The slow-cooked, simple and sumptuous dishes are best eaten at a leisurely pace and almost always served in generous portion sizes at affordable prices – truly a large-hearted cuisine much like those who create it.

Biden announced last month that his administration was planning for boosters to be available for all Americans who received the mRNA vaccines in an effort to provide more enduring protection against the coronavirus, pending approvals from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration. Those agencies, though, are awaiting critical data before signing off on the third doses, with Moderna’s vaccine increasingly seen as unlikely to make the Sept. 20 milestone. According to one official, Moderna produced inadequate data for the FDA and CDC to recommend the third dose of its vaccine and FDA has requested additional data that is likely to delay those boosters into October. Pfizer, which is further along in the review process, in part because of data collected from the vaccine’s use in Israel, is still expected to be approved for a third dose for all by September 20. A key FDA panel is to review Pfizer’s data on boosters on September 17. Data for boosters on Johnson & Johnson’s single-dose vaccine won’t be available for months, since that shot wasn’t approved until February, officials said. Dr. Janet Woodcock, the acting FDA commissioner, and CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky, briefed White House Covid-19 coordinator Jeff Zients and other officials about the expected Moderna delay on Thursday, officials said. Most of the 206 million Americans at least partially vaccinated against Covid-19 received the Pfizer shot, but about 80 million received the Moderna vaccine, according to CDC data. The administration’s public pronouncement about booster availability, a break from the more deliberate and behind-the-scenes planning that defined its early vaccination campaign, sparked concerns from some that the White House was getting ahead of the science on boosters. The White House said it was merely preparing for the boosters’ eventual approval, and that the reviews were “all part of a process that is now underway.” “We are awaiting a full review and approval by the FDA and a recommendation by the ACIP,” said White House spokesman Chris Meagher, referencing the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. “When that approval and recommendation are made, we will be ready to implement the plan our nation’s top doctors developed so that we are staying ahead of this virus.” Even before Biden’s announcement last month, his administration had been preparing for months for the possibility that boosters would be required, maintaining America’s supply of doses and devising promotion plans with the same “intensity” that it brought to the initial vaccination campaign, Zients told reporters Thursday. Biden on August 18 touted boosters as a protection against the more transmissible delta variant of the virus, which is raging across the country and slowing the economic recovery from the pandemic, as well as potential variants to come. “Just remember, as a simple rule — rule: Eight months after your second shot, get a booster shot,” he said then, adding that health experts were aiming to be ready to administer them by Sept. 20, pending approval by the regulatory agencies. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, has become an outspoke champion of the booster campaign, as the Biden administration looks to curtail the delta variant. He told reporters on Thursday he believes it is likely that Americans will all need to get a third dose of the mRNA vaccines to be considered fully vaccinated against Covid-19. “From my own experience as an immunologist, I would not at all be surprised that the adequate, full regimen for vaccination will likely be three doses,” he said. A formal determination that the third dose is required for “full vaccination” would have broad implications for schools, businesses and other entities that have implemented vaccination mandates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-booster-plan-faces-complications-some-may-miss-september-20/articleshow/85912612.cms||---

Those figures are up from the 372,116,617 vaccine doses the CDC said had gone into arms by September 2 out of 445,672,595 doses delivered. The agency said 206,461,869 people had received at least one dose while 175,538,025 people were fully vaccinated as of 6:00 a.m. ET on Friday. The CDC tally includes two-dose vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech , as well as Johnson & Johnson's one-shot vaccine. About 1.25 million people have received an additional dose of either Pfizer or Moderna's vaccine since August 13, when the US authorized a third dose of the vaccines for people with compromised immune systems who are likely to have weaker protection from the two-dose regimens.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-administers-373-5-million-doses-of-covid-19-vaccines-cdc/articleshow/85913278.cms||---
---||World||US President Biden orders declassification reviews of documents related to September 11 attacks||WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden on Friday ordered reviews of the potential declassification of documents from the FBI's investigation into the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. "When I ran for president, I made a commitment to ensuring transparency regarding the declassification of documents on the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on America," Biden said in a statement. "As we approach the 20th anniversary of that tragic day, I am honoring that commitment." Biden said his order directed the Department of Justice and other agencies to "oversee a declassification review of documents" related to the FBI probe. The order requires Attorney General Merrick Garland to make the declassified documents public over the next six months, he said. Family members of victims of the September 11 attacks asked a US government watchdog on Thursday to investigate their suspicions that the FBI lied about or destroyed evidence linking Saudi Arabia to the hijackers. The request in a letter to Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz said "circumstances make it likely that one or more FBI officials committed willful misconduct with intent to destroy or secrete evidence to avoid its disclosure." Biden will commemorate the anniversary of the attacks next week. "My heart continues to be with the 9/11 families who are suffering, and my Administration will continue to engage respectfully with members of this community," the statement said. "I welcome their voices and insight as we chart a way forward."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-president-biden-orders-declassification-reviews-of-documents-related-to-september-11-attacks/articleshow/85913425.cms||---
---||India||Supreme Court to evaluate performance of CBI, seeks data on success rate||NEW DELHI: The Central Bureau of Investigation is likely to get its performance as a prosecuting agency appraised by the Supreme Court, which on Friday decided to analyse the agency’s performance and success rate in investigation and prosecution in terms of bringing cases to logical conclusion. The court directed the CBI director to place before it the number of cases in which the agency was successful in getting accused convicted in trial courts and high courts. A bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and M M Sundresh said that it is not enough for the agency just to lodge a case and conduct probe and but also to ensure that prosecution is successfully done. The SC is examining the efficiency of prosecuting wing of the CBI as it had earlier noted that there was “a saga of gross negligence in performing duties” resulting in inordinate delay in filing of cases in courts and had sought response from its director. As additional solicitor general Sanjay Jain, appearing for the agency, contended that in an adversarial litigation system like India, success rate in litigation should be considered just one of the factors in determining efficiency, the bench said that the same yardstick is followed across the world and there was no reason that it should not be applied to the CBI. “We would like to have data regarding cases being handled by the CBI. How many cases the CBI is prosecuting, time period for which the cases are pending in trial courts and what is the success rate of the CBI in trial courts and high courts. We want to see what is the success rate of the agency,” the bench said. The bench said efficiency of a prosecuting agency is determined on the basis of cases it brings to a logical conclusion and time taken by the agency, and gave the CBI director four weeks’ time to file the data which would be analysed by the court on the next date of hearing. “World over the assessment is being done on the basis of success rate. If you cannot sustain the prosecution case then what is the need to lodge case and conduct the probe. Success rate is very important and has to be considered,” the bench told the ASG who tried to persuade the court not to go by the success rate. The court also said that there are other ways to settle the dispute like plea bargaining which could be resorted to if the agency was not able to prosecute successfully. The court initiated the exercise to examine the efficiency of the CBI while hearing CBI’s appeal which was filed after an inordinate delay of 542 days. “The aforesaid prima facie shows clearly gross incompetence in the legal department of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) which raises serious questions of its efficacy to prosecute the cases.” the bench had said while deciding to examine the issues which are hampering the functioning of the premier investigating agency. In addition seeking a record of cases under trial,, the bench also directed the CBI director to file affidavit stating the steps taken by him to bolster the functioning of the agency and what system should be put in place to facilitate a proper functioning of prosecution of legal cases. “What is the way to strengthen the prosecuting wing of the agency. What are the bottlenecks. We would like to know what steps you have taken to strengthen the wing. One of the the bottlenecks is the absence of requisite number of manpower. You have to set your house in order,” the bench said. The agency, had earlier, tried to justify delay in filing appeal on the ground that its legal department was over-burdened as it was dealing with 95 cases but the bench had refused to accept the explanation. “Firstly, that number is not extraordinary and secondly, it is for the petitioner (CBI) to take a call as to how many persons are required to manage their affairs. It appears that the file was also lying with the Additional Solicitor General for about two months,” the bench had said.

Blinken told a news conference at the State Department he would meet with Afghans and workers in the Qatari capital Doha "who are doing truly heroic work around the clock." He said he would travel to the Ramstein Air Base in Germany where he also would meet with Afghans. The ministerial meeting will be held virtually with partners, including more than 20 countries that have a stake in relocating and settling Afghans. Blinken also said the US government was maintaining contact with the Taliban. "We continue to maintain channels of communication with the Taliban, on issues that are important," Blinken said. The State Department was "in constant contact" with Americans remaining in Afghanistan who still wish to leave the country, Blinken said. "We have dedicated teams assigned to each of these American citizens to be in constant contact with them. We're providing them with very tailored, very specific guidance," he said. Almost all of those remaining are dual nationals whose homes are in Afghanistan and whose extended families live there, Blinken said. "It's no surprise that deciding whether or not to leave the place they call home is a wrenching decision," he said. Blinken also described the department's efforts since President Joe Biden took office in January to speed the processing of special visas for Afghans who worked with US forces during the 20-year war, thousands of whom are still in Afghanistan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-secretary-of-state-antony-blinken-to-discuss-afghan-evacuees-at-meetings-in-qatar-and-germany/articleshow/85913705.cms||---
---||India||Supreme Court collegium clears record 68 names for judgeship in 12 HCs; 44 advocates included||NEW DELHI: The three-member Supreme Court Collegium headed by Chief Justice N V Ramana on Friday recommended to the Union government names of 68 people for appointment as judges of 12 high courts, most of which are hamstrung by 50% vacancies in judge posts even while struggling to deal with a heavy pendency. The collegium, comprising CJI Ramana and Justices U U Lalit and A M Kahnwilkar, considered 113 names after intense deliberations spanning several days and found 68 suitable for being recommended for appointment to high courts of Allahabad, Rajasthan, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Jammu and Kashmir, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Punjab and Haryana, Kerala, Chhattisgarh and Assam. The significance of recommending 68 names at one go can be gauged from the strenuousness characterising the exercise, which included scrutinising the antecedents of the candidates in the zone of consideration, their income and reputation and their attitudinal suitability for holding the constitutional posts. In contrast, from January to April this year, the collegium headed by then CJI S A Bobde and comprising Justices N V Ramana and R F Nariman in six different meetings could recommend names of only 46 people for appointment as judges to nine HCs. Of the 68 names recommended by the collegium for appointment as HC judges, 44 are advocates and 24 are senior judicial officers in the district judge rank. The collegium has deferred consideration of 16 names awaiting further information on certain issues. Rest of the names were sent back to HC collegiums for reconsideration. The HCs have a cumulative pendency of nearly 60 lakh cases but are handicapped by 43% vacancy in judges post -- against a sanctioned strength of 1089 judges, there are 465 vacancies. The three-member collegium led by CJI Ramana would have to work overtime in future to bring a semblance of normalcy in the working strength of judges in the HCs, which may require many more such mass-scale recommendations for appointment as HC judges. Most of the big high courts are plagued for long by large numbers of vacancies, which exceeded 50% in some cases. The biggest of them all, Allahabad HC has a sanctioned strength of 160 judges, but it has 68 posts vacant. The Calcutta HC with 72 sanctioned strength has 36 vacancies. As against the sanctioned strength of 94 of Bombay HC, it has 33 vacancies. Delhi HC has more than 50% vacancies as 31 of its 60 sanctioned posts of judges are vacant. One of the oldest high courts at Patna has 64% vacancy as 34 of 53 sanctioned posts of judges are vacant. Rajasthan HC has more than 50% vacancy as 27 of 50 posts of judges are vacant. Telangana is the worst off in terms of judge strength. It has 31 posts of judges vacant against 42 sanctioned posts, or 74% vacancy. Gujarat HC has 50% vacancy in its sanctioned strength of 52 posts. Madhya Pradesh HC has a working strength of 29 as against sanctioned 53 posts of judges. Punjab and Haryana HC, the third largest in the country in terms of sanctioned judge strength, has 40 vacancies against its optimum strength of 80 judges. Andhra Pradesh HC has a sanctioned strength of 37 judges but 18 posts are vacant. Mizoram to get first judge in Gauhati HC, a woman DJAmong the 68 names cleared for appointment as HC judges by the SC collegium is Marli Vankung, who is currently the Aizawl district judge and comes from the Schedule Tribe community. If the government approves her appointment, she will be the first one, and a woman, to be appointed from Mizoram as a judge of Gauhati HC. Daughter of Brig C Vankunga, Marli Vankung did her LLB from Delhi University and MPhil from JNU before joining Mizoram judicial services. The collegium also cleared three other names, including two from the ST community — Vankung from Mizoram and advocate K Sema from Nagaland — recommended by the Gauhati HC as late as June 5, 2021, and which the SC collegium had received from the law ministry on August 16. Within 15 days, the SC collegium cleared the names for the Gauhati HC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/supreme-court-collegium-clears-record-68-names-for-judgeship-in-12-hcs-44-advocates-included/articleshow/85914052.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The cars being recalled are certain petrol variants of Ciaz sedan, Ertiga utility vehicle, and SUVs Vitara Brezza, SCross and XL6. Maruti said that the replacement of the affected part shall begin from the first week of November. “Till then, customers are requested to avoid driving in water-logged areas and direct water spray on electrical/electronic parts in vehicle.” The change of faulty parts will be undertaken free of cost, the company said, adding that customers will receive a communication from dealerships regarding the exercise. “Recall campaigns are undertaken globally to rectify faults that may be potential safety defects. In the interest of customers, Maruti has decided to voluntarily recall the affected vehicles for inspection/replacement of motor generator unit, free of cost. Affected vehicle owners would be receiving a communication from Maruti authorised workshops,” the company said. The company said that customers of suspected vehicles can also visit the ‘Imp Customer Info’ section on the company websites www.marutisuzuki.com (for Ertiga and Vitara Brezza) or www.nexaexperience.com(for Ciaz, XL6 and S-Cross) and fill in their vehicle’s chassis number to check if their vehicle needs any attention. While previously it was voluntary, the government has now made announcement of recalls mandatory for vehicle manufacturers in case they notice defects that are generic in nature. Penalties have also been stipulated with regards to the exercise. Previously, there used to be instances where vehicle companies would avoid calling out generic defects, fearing impact on the branding.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/maruti-recalls-1-8-lakh-cars-sold-from-2018-to-2020-for-faulty-unit/articleshow/85914155.cms||---

The devastation was clear as Air Force One approached New Orleans, with uprooted trees and blue tarps covering shredded houses coming into focus ahead of landing. The path to nearby LaPlace, where Biden was to be briefed by local officials, was dotted with wood poles that held power lines jutting from the ground at odd angles. “I promise we’re going to have your back,” Biden said at the outset of the briefing. Such trips to natural disaster scenes have long been a feature of the US presidency. It’s a moment to demonstrate compassion and show the public that the president is leading during the crisis. It’s also an opportunity to hit pause, however temporarily, from the political sniping that often dominates Washington. In shirtsleeves and boots, Biden was welcomed at the airport by Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat. Several Republicans, including Sen. Bill Cassidy and Rep. Steve Scalise, the House Republican whip, were also on hand. Biden was meeting with with local officials and touring a neighborhood in LaPlace, a community between the Mississippi River and Lake Pontchartrain that suffered catastrophic wind and water damage and was left with sheared-off roofs and flooded homes. He also planned a flyover tour of hard-hit communities including Lafitte, Grand Isle, Port Fourchon and Lafourche Parish, where Parish President Archie Chaisson said 25% of the homes in his community of 100,000 people were gone or had catastrophic damage. Past presidents have been defined in part by how they handled such crises. Donald Trump casually lobbed paper towels to people in Puerto Rico after a hurricane, generating scorn from critics but little damage to his political standing. Barack Obama hugged New Jersey Republican Governor Chris Christie in 2012 after Superstorm Sandy, a brief respite from partisan tensions that had threatened the economy with a fiscal cliff. And George W. Bush fell out of public favor after a poor and unprepared response to Hurricane Katrina, which swamped New Orleans in 2005. In the aftermath of Hurricane Ida, Biden is grappling with the persistent threat posed by climate change and the prospect that disaster zone visits may become a more regular feature of the presidency. Beyond the damage on the Gulf Coast, remnants from the storm killed at least 46 people from Maryland to Connecticut. The president has pointed to that destruction to call for greater public resolve to confront climate change and help the nation deal with the fierce storms, flooding and wildfires that have beset the country. Scientists say climate change increases the frequency of extreme weather events — such as large tropical storms, and the droughts and heatwaves that create conditions for vast wildfires. US weather officials recently reported that July 2021 was the hottest month ever recorded in 142 years of record-keeping. Biden’s nearly eight-month-old presidency has been shaped in part by perpetual crises. The president went to Texas in February after a cold winter storm caused its power grid to fail and he has repeatedly monitored the wildfires that have darkened skies in Western states. Besides natural disasters, the president has had to contend with a multitude of other challenges. He is searching for ways to rescue the 100-200 Americans stuck in Afghanistan after the longest war in US history ended only a matter of days ago. He is also confronting the delta variant of the coronavirus that has stuck the country in an autumn of uncertainty only months after Biden declared independence from the disease at a July 4 celebration on the White House lawn. His call for resolve to help the country overcome the pandemic and forge a $1 trillion infrastructure deal is now being applied to the perilous task of withstanding the aftershocks of climate change. The proposal intends to ensure that the vital networks connecting cities and states and the country as a whole can withstand the flooding, whirlwinds and damage caused by increasingly dangerous weather. At Friday’s briefing with local officials, Biden insisted the infrastructure bill and an even more expansive measure would more effectively prepare the country for new challenges. “It seems to me we can save a whole lot of money, a whole lot of pain for our constituents, if we build back, rebuild it back in a better way,” Biden said. “I realize I’m selling as I’m talking.” Ida was the fifth-most powerful storm to strike the US when it hit Louisiana on Sunday with maximum winds of 150 mph (240 kph), likely causing tens of billions of dollars in flood, wind and other damage, including to the electrical grid. The storm’s remnants dropped devastating rainfall across parts of Maryland, Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey on Wednesday, causing significant disruption to major population centers. The storm has killed at least 48 people in the Northeastern US and at least 13 in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-to-storm-ravaged-laplace-were-going-to-have-your-back/articleshow/85913930.cms||---

Senior advocate Sidharth Luthra said the DGP’s appointment was exclusively within the state government’s domain and that no role cou-ld be assigned to the UPSC as has been erroneously done by the SC in its 2006 police reforms judgment in the Prakash Singh case. A bench of Justices L N Rao, B R Gavai and B V Nagarathna said, “Let us be frank with you Mr Luthra. Please do not file applications repeatedly with the same prayers even though the earlier pleas had been rejected. It does not look good when done by a state government.” “Even individuals should not indulge in such activities. If states start doing so, then there will be no end to liti-gation. It will further slow down the process of adjudication in the Supreme Court. And it is lawyers like you who say that even hearing on bail applications are delayed,” Justice Rao said. The bench told Luthra that the West Bengal government’s fresh application was nothing but “an abuse of the process which cannot be permitted. We can only allow you to withdraw the petition”. Luthra said that the state is seeking to be a party in the pending matter. The bench said it was ready to make the state a party afresh though the Supreme Court post-Prakash Singh judgment had extensively heard the states. Appearing for Prakash Singh, advocate Prashant Bhushan said that though 15 years have passed, most states have not fully implemented the directions given by the SC in the judgment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/west-bengal-faces-supreme-court-fire-on-dgp-appointment/articleshow/85914234.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Those that have been added to the list include drugs to fight cancer, diabetes, tuberculosis and HIV apart from some antivirals. The government has also deleted 16 drugs from the existing list and the final NLEM 2021 now contains 399 essential medicines, up from 376 drugs that are currently under direct price control. The revised list, prepared by an expert committee under the Indian Council of Medical Research, was submitted to health minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Thursday. Once the list is notified by the health ministry, it will be evaluated by the Standing Committee on Affordable Medicines and Health Products (SCAMHP) to assess which of the medicines require price capping. The final price capping will be done by the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority based on the recommendations of the SCAMHP, headed by Niti Aayog member-health Dr V K Paul. Those that have been added to the list include drugs to fight cancer, diabetes, tuberculosis and HIV apart from some antivirals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/39-medicines-added-to-list-of-essentials-prices-to-come-down/articleshow/85914265.cms||Sushmi Dey

The Caldor Fire remained only a few miles from the city of South Lake Tahoe, which was emptied of 22,000 residents days ago, along with casinos and shops across the state line in Nevada, but no significant fire activity occurred since Thursday , officials said. Tim Ernst, an operations section chief, said fire officials were cautiously optimistic thanks to “a lot of hard work” by firefighters over the past two weeks. The nearly 333-square-mile (862-square-kilometer) fire was not making any significant advances and was not challenging containment lines in long sections of its perimeter, but Ernst said “the risk is still out there” with some areas that remained hot. Crews were restoring utility services, knocking down hazardous trees and putting out smoldering hot spots to prepare certain areas for repopulation, but the timeline for allowing residents back to their home remains unclear, said Capt. Parker Wilbourn, a spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. “At this point, we don’t know. We’re doing everything we can to mop up the fire and clean up areas that need to be cleaned up,” Wilbourn said. The fire had been driven northeast on a course leading to South Lake Tahoe for days by southwestern winds, but that pattern ended this week. Calmer winds and increased humidity Thursday and Friday helped crews increase containment of the blaze to 29%. “Very positive trends with regards to weather,” said Dean Gould, a U.S. Forest Service administrator. “That’s huge for us. Let’s take full advantage of it while we have this window.” With the fire growing at the smallest rate in two weeks, he said, “Things are clearly heading in the right direction for us.” Amid the positive outlook, incident meteorologist Jim Dudley warned that the air mass in the Sierra Nevada drains downslope every night and then sloshes upslope during the day and that the region’s terrain of ridges and deep canyons can create winds that go in “squirrely directions.” “Just because we don’t have red flag wind conditions across the fire, the wind threat is still there and it’s all localized,” he warned. The fire — which began Aug. 14, was named after the road where it started and raged through densely forested, craggy areas — was still considered a threat to more than 30,000 homes, businesses and other buildings ranging from cabins to ski resorts. Residents who were forced to flee South Lake Tahoe earlier this week remained evacuated along with people across the state line in Douglas County, Nevada. The resort area can easily accommodate 100,000 people on a busy weekend but was eerily empty just before the Labor Day weekend. The wildfire dealt a major blow to an economy that heavily depends on tourism and was starting to rebound this summer from pandemic shutdowns. “It’s a big hit for our local businesses and the workers who rely on a steady income to pay rent and put food on their table,” said Devin Middlebrook, mayor pro-tem of South Lake Tahoe. He said the shutdown will also hurt the city, as it gets most of its revenue to pay for police and fire services, as well as road maintenance, from hotel taxes and sales taxes. Friday’s forecast called for lighter winds but also extremely dry daytime weather, with a warming trend through the weekend as high pressure builds over the West, fire officials said. More than 15,000 firefighters were battling dozens of California blazes that have destroyed at least 1,500 homes. One blaze, the Dixie Fire, was about 65 miles (105 kilometers) north of the Caldor Fire. It is the second-largest wildfire in state history at about 1,350 square miles (3,496 square kilometers) and is 55% contained. California has experienced increasingly larger and deadlier wildfires in recent years as climate change has made the West much warmer and drier over the past 30 years. Scientists have said weather will continue to be more extreme and wildfires more frequent, destructive and unpredictable. No deaths have been reported so far this fire season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/huge-wildfire-near-lake-tahoe-slows-as-weather-improves/articleshow/85914282.cms||---

Addressing the 6th Eastern Economic Forum (EEF) in Vladivostok, Modi stressed on the importance of greater economic and commercial engagement between the two sides in line with the ‘Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership’. The friendship between India and Russia has stood the test of time, said Modi. “Most recently it was seen in our robust cooperation during the Covid-19 pandemic including in the area of vaccines. The pandemic has highlighted the importance of the health and pharma sectors in our bilateral cooperation,” he said. Expressing happiness that the Chennai — Vladivostok Maritime Corridor is making headway, Modi said this connectivity project along with the International North-South Corridor will bring India and Russia physically closer to each other. “Despite the pandemic related restrictions there had been good progress in strengthening our business links in many areas. This include long term supply of coking coal to the Indian steel industry. We are also exploring new opportunities in agro industry, ceramics, strategic and rare earth minerals and diamonds,” said Modi. Despite the challenges of Covid-19 pandemic, the government said in a statement, an Indian delegation led by minister of petroleum and natural gas Hardeep Singh Puri comprising leading Indian oil and gas companies are attending the India-Russia Business dialogue within the framework of EEF.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/will-partner-moscow-to-develop-russian-far-east-pm-narendra-modi/articleshow/85914364.cms||---

Katakey to lead a five-member committee to assess the ecological damage caused by the Baghjan oil well blowout last year. The top court rejected OIL’s objection to Katakey as chairman of the committee that will assess and suggest measures to restore the Dibru-Saikhowa National Park and surrounding ecologically fragile areas in the Tinsukia district of Assam, which were impacted in the Baghjan oil well blowout in May 2020. Besides Justice Katakey as chairperson, the new committee will comprise Qamar Qureshi, a professor with the Wildlife Institute of India; Ritesh Kumar, director of the Wetlands International South Asia; Bedanga Bordoloi, a soil expert and G.S. Dang, a petroleum expert. The eight-member panel headed by retired Gauhati high court Judge Brojendra Prasad Katakey was formed on June 24, 2020, less than a month after OIL’s Well No. 5 at Baghjan in Tinsukia district had a blowout. The Baghjan blowout, explosion and fire that lasted for over five months in the natural gas well owned by public sector unit OIL left serious destruction on the ecology, besides causing damages estimated Rs 25,000 crore to the environment and biodiversity in and around Baghjan in Tinsukia district, an inquiry report prepared by a senior forest official had revealed this year in June. The report titled “Report on Damages to Environment, Biodiversity, Wildlife, Forest & Ecology on account of Blowout and Explosion at OIL Well number BGN-5, Baghjan, Tinsukia”, is prepared by the one-man inquiry committee headed by Mahendra Kumar Yadava, additional principal chief conservator of forest and chief wildlife warden, Assam. “This situation has come to be because the environmental clearance provided by the the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEF&CC) to these projects clearly stated that there were no national parks and wildlife sanctuaries within 10km of the project sites,” the report stated. The court requested the committee to begin its work expeditiously and submit an interim report within a month on the remedial compensation OIL ought to pay. The court directed OIL to pay for the committee’s expenses. The 10-member panel was constituted by the NGT with Assam chief secretary as its chairman and OIL’s managing director as a member. Disappointed with the NGT order, Kolkata-based environmental activist Bonani Kakkar approached the apex court seeking the removal of OIL from a committee that would assess the blowout caused by OIL itself and suggest restorative steps. During the hearing, the Supreme Court while observing that “it will be breach of the principles of natural justice” if managing director of Oil India Limited (OIL) becomes a member of a committee in any case related to Assam's Baghjan blowout incident, had stayed the NGT order in July.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/sc-removes-assam-chief-secy-oil-boss-from-blowout-probe-panel/articleshow/85907004.cms||Rokibuz Zaman

The agitating students belong to the 2019-20 final year batches of ITIs affiliated to the State Council of Vocational Training (SCVT). With the Covid-19 pandemic wreaking havoc across the world, their examinations couldn’t be completed on time. Alleging that they have been stuck for the last one year after their examinations were cancelled, the students have been deprived of the opportunity to apply for various recruitment exams as they are yet to garner a diploma or a certificate. The students have also despatched a memorandum to minister of skill development & entrepreneurship, Chandramohan Patowary, containing their three demands.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/hunger-strike-by-final-year-iti-students/articleshow/85907022.cms||---
---||World||India hopes Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar’s stint as ‘international negotiator’ will have sobering effect||NEW DELHI: As the Taliban appear set to announce Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar Akhund, the group’s public face for the past three years as their leader, India is hoping his recent experience of being chief international negotiator with the US and head of outreach with other major powers will influence his approach to policies that affect India. According to reports, Sher Mohammed Stanekzai as well as Sirajuddin Haqqani may also be given positions of power in the new government while Baradar seems set for a leading role. Born in 1968 in Uruzgan province, Baradar is a Durrani Pashtun from the Popalzai tribe, sharing tribal loyalties with former Afghan President Hamid Karzai. As one of the few leaders close to Mullah Omar, Baradar served as the Taliban’s deputy defence minister during the 1996-2001 regime. Afghanistan crisis liveAfter the US invasion of 2001, Baradar fled to Pakistan, where he organised the military resistance to US occupation in Afghanistan, becoming the head of the Rahbari Shura, in charge of operational decisions. But in 2010, Pakistan arrested him and threw him in jail for the next eight years, because Islamabad suspected him of stitching a deal with Karzai and the US. According to reports, Baradar and other Taliban leaders like Mullah Abdul Rauf Aliza and Mullah Ahmed Jan Akhundzada, were reported to belong to more moderate forces within the Taliban.

---||World||Climate change blamed for havoc in northeast US floods||NEW YORK: Climate change and creaky infrastructure were blamed Friday for the scale of the impact from floods tearing through New York City when remnants of Hurricane Ida swept across the US northeast, killing at least 49 people. "We are in a whole different world," New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said after the flash floods. "This is a different challenge." Record rain turned streets into rivers and shut down subway services as water cascaded onto tracks. Nearly a dozen people drowned in basement apartments. The extreme weather, combined with a lack of preparation, stretched the United States' biggest city to breaking point. "It's no big surprise that the city seems to break down every time there's a big storm," said Jonathan Bowles, executive director of the think-tank Center for an Urban Future. "The city's infrastructure hasn't kept pace with the population growth that New York's had in the last couple of decades, let alone the increasing ferocity of storms, and rising sea levels that have come with climate change," Bowles said. While there has been a lot of investment in big projects -- train stations, airports, new bridges -- less funding has gone to "unsexy" projects such as sewer lines and water mains, he said. Nicole Gelinas, an urban economics expert at the Manhattan Institute, another think-tank, said New York's infrastructure "was not built for seven inches of rainfall in a few hours." Drains for the city's sewer system get clogged, Gelinas said, and "there's not enough green space to catch some of the water before it runs into the drains. "So some of these avenues, they become canals when there's a big storm." New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania were the hardest hit by Ida, which ravaged the southern state of Louisiana and the Gulf Coast earlier in the week before sweeping northeast. President Joe Biden, who has made threats from climate change a priority, flew to Louisiana, where more than 800,000 people remained without power after Ida made landfall as a Category 4 storm. He said costly improvements to the levee system around New Orleans after the far deadlier Hurricane Katrina in 2005 had proved their worth in preventing more catastrophic damage this time. Similarly transformative infrastructure projects -- rather than simply rebuilding -- will have to become the new norm, he said, pushing for passage of his giant $3.5 trillion infrastructure bill in Congress. "Things have changed so drastically in terms of the environment, you've already crossed a certain threshold," he said. "You can't build back a road, a highway or a bridge to what it was before." New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy said Storm Ida had left 25 people dead in his state, most of them "individuals who got caught in their vehicles." Thirteen deaths were reported in New York City, including 11 victims who could not escape their basements, police said. Three people were killed in the New York suburb of Westchester, while another five died in Pennsylvania and one -- a state trooper -- in Connecticut, officials said. "I'm 50 years old and I've never seen that much rain ever," said Metodija Mihajlov, whose Manhattan restaurant basement was flooded with three inches of water. "It was like living in the jungle, like tropical rain. Unbelievable. Everything is so strange this year," Mihajlov told AFP. The National Weather Service recorded 3.15 inches of rain in New York's Central Park in just an hour -- beating a record set just last month during Storm Henri. The US Open tennis tournament was halted as howling wind and rain blew under the corners of the Louis Armstrong Stadium roof. It is rare for such storms to strike America's northeastern seaboard and comes as the surface layer of oceans warms due to climate change. The warming is causing cyclones to become more powerful and carry more water, posing an increasing threat to the world's coastal communities, scientists say. "Global warming is upon us and it's going to get worse and worse and worse unless we do something about it," said New York Senator Chuck Schumer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/climate-change-blamed-for-havoc-in-northeast-us-floods/articleshow/85914412.cms||---

No less than 107 languages are spoken in Bengaluru, including 22 scheduled and 84 non-scheduled languages. The other districts where more than 100 languages are spoken are Dimapur of Nagaland (103) and Sonitpur of Assam (101), says the analysis by Shamika Ravi, a non-resident senior fellow of Brookings Institution, and Mudit Kapoor, associate professor of economics at Indian Statistical Institute. 44% of city’s people speak KannadaThe list of districts where more than 90 languages are heard includes Jalpaiguri in Bengal (98), East Khasi Hills in Meghalaya (96), South West Delhi (97), Karbi Anglong in Assam (95), Pune (93) and Darjeeling (91). Mumbai suburban has 88 languages. The least diverse districts include Yanam (Puducherry), Kaimur (Bhabua, Bihar), Kaushambi and Kanpur Dehat (UP) and Ariyalur (Tamil Nadu). In these districts, less than 20 languages are spoken. In Bengaluru, the total percentage of people who speak Kannada is 44.5%. Other major languages include Tamil (15%), Telugu (14%), Urdu (12%), Hindi (6%), Malayalam (3%). All languages coveredThe authors said the census covers all languages irrespective of the population size that speaks it. “Mobility is a good marker for economic dynamism... Language is a good proxy for talent... When people speaking different langua-ges come to one place, the driving force is economy, jobs. The language tree for Bengaluru shows there are people from far and wide,” said Shamika Ravi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/at-107-max-languages-spoken-in-bengaluru/articleshow/85914744.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka’s April-August tax revenue up 43%||BENGALURU: Karnataka has kicked off the financial year with a significant increase in its tax revenue in the first quarter over the previous year on the back of fewer Covid-related restrictions and an increase in overall economic activity. For the quarter ending June 30, Karnataka earned Rs 23,177 crore in own tax revenue — 58% more than in Q1 of the previous year — with commercial taxes & stamps and registration fees raking in 61% and 65% more than the previous year, respectively. In July and August, the state’s exchequer earned Rs 20,266 crore, pushing the revenue in the first five months of the fiscal to Rs 43,000 crore. This is 43% more than Rs 30,429 crore earned in the first five months of the previous year. The government has raked in Rs 3,922 crore from non-tax revenue in the April-August period, which is 103% more than it earned for the like period last year. TAX REVENUE UPHope third wave won’t hurt: FICCI memberOf this Rs 3,922 crore, 56% was earned in the first quarter, which compared to the same period last year was nearly 120% more. Pointing out that overall economic activity has picked up, J Crasta, member, national executive committee, FICCI, said: “MSMEs are struggling as PSU banks are not lending enough and there are huge inventories and labour problems. While we believe the coming quarter will be better, we hope the third wave doesn’t hurt us.” While experts admitted the high growth could be attributed to low-base effect, finance department officials said the earnings this year are in line with the government target. Karnataka’s revenue target from its own taxes for the fiscal is Rs 1.1 lakh crore and with around 40% (five of the 12 months) of the year complete already, the state has earned around 39% or Rs 43,443 crore of the revenue. Analysis of source-wise data shows the government has already got 41% of the target set for commercial taxes, while excise has earned 41.5%. However, revenue from motor vehicles stands at 29% of the target, while stamps and registrations is at 36%. “We are hopeful of these two sectors increasing further in this quarter (ending September 30) and the next one. By December end, we believe they would also be closer to the target,” one of the officials said. The state’s non-tax revenue for the fiscal is Rs 8,258 crore and it has already got 47.5% of the same and is expected to achieve 100% collection before March.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnatakas-april-aug-tax-revenue-up-43/articleshow/85914760.cms||Chethan Kumar

Now in charge of Chhattisgarh BJP, she made the controversial statement while trying to motivate party workers to fight for victory in the 2023 assembly polls. On the last day of three-day long ‘chintan shivir’ of the party in Jagdalpur on Thursday, she targeted the CM and said: “I appeal to all of you to take a resolution today as the responsibility lies with you to bring BJP back to power in Chhattisgarh. If you turn around and spit only once, Bhupesh Baghel and his cabinet will be swept away. With this resolution, you all should work hard, and BJP will definitely regain power in 2023.” The video of her statement was shared widely on social media, and triggered a sharp reaction from Baghel. “She was all right when she was with Congress. She was a junior minister to the leader Arjun Singh. What can be said about her statement? I didn’t expect that after joining BJP, Purandeswari’s mental state would stoop so low. If one spits at the sky, it will fall back on their face.” Sources in BJP say many saffron leaders are also upset with Purandeswari for her remark. “She has destroyed the seriousness of ‘chintan shivir’ with one careless remark,” said one of them. The BJP brainstorming session was crucial as the party strategy was to be formulated for the next assembly election, with the focus on winning back the tribal vote base in Bastar. On the final day, Purandeswari said: “Our karyakarta are the backbone of the party. It’s you who made us leaders. It doesn’t matter if the workers are from a small place, everyone is important. Look, the winds of change are evident in Bastar already. Hence, take a resolve to bring BJP back to power in 2023.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/raipur/bjp-leaders-spit-remark-sparks-a-spat-in-state-politics/articleshow/85914953.cms||---

Deputy commissioner of Assam’s Hailakandi district Rohan Jha in a letter to his Kolasib district counterpart in Mizoram said the two camps and one bunker, set up by Mizoram Police on August 26, 2021, in the inner line reserve forests in the Kachurthal Balicherra area and Hailakandi district, were asked to be dismantled on August 27, “but there was no action taken from your end to de-escalate the issue”. “Thus, you are once again requested to dismantle the 2 camps and 1 bunker built on 26th of August, the camp built on 2nd of September, 2021 and order Mizoram Police at these camps to return to Kolasib district and not undertake any fresh construction in the border areas to avoid law and order situation. Further, it is imperative that the jhum farmers residing in the inter-border areas in Kolasib district should be counseled and instructed by your good office, not to start any new construction within the constitutional boundary of Assam in the inter-state border area.” Jha’s letter was sent after Kolasib DC on September 2 wrote to him alleging kidnapping of a Mizo driver of an excavator by Assam Police. Kolasib DC Dr H Lalthangliana wrote, “It has been brought to my notice based on a reliable report that this afternoon at Aitlang in Pu Lalngaisanga’s land where road construction connecting jhum land is undertaken by the farmers using Excavator JCB Reg. No. MZ05 A 4464, Assam Police damaged the door of excavator and snatched the keys from the JCB operator Pu Lalnarammawia. Further, the JCB operator was blindfolded and kidnapped with a gun pointed to his head by the Assam Police wearing commando uniform. He was then dragged to the river, his clothes ripped off and threatened.” In his reply, Jha wrote, “…there was no illegal act done by the Assam Police, but it was a routine intervention to stop illegal encroachment within the constitutional boundary of Assam. The allegations mentioned in your letter are baseless and fictitious.” Jha’s letter says, “Today, on the 2nd of September, 2021, Assam forest staff along with the Assam Police went to the Kachurthal Balicherra area and noticed that a road was being constructed inside the constitutional boundary of Assam and instructed the driver to stop the construction and immediately return to Mizoram. Assam Police informed the Mizoram resident that he has trespassed into the land of Assam and shall be arrested under relevant sections of CrPC, if the construction is not slopped. The driver immediately stopped the construction and fearing arrest, went back to Kolasib district.” Jha said such instances of construction and force deployment inside the constitutional boundary of Assam “are in clear violation of the joint statement issued by both the governments on the August 5” and “are very detrimental in the peace-keeping efforts along the interstate border”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/assam-reminds-mizoram-to-honour-peace-agreement/articleshow/85909043.cms||Prabin Kalita

The benchmark closed 277 points higher at 58,130 as foreign funds continued their buying spree. The Nifty on the NSE, too, rallied to a new high at above the 17,300-point mark, closing 89 points higher at 17,324. Robust GST numbers, growing services PMI and strong global cues also helped the rally. The rupee also settled with a marginal gain of 5 paise at 73.02 against the US dollar on Friday, as the domestic equities continued their record-setting spree. At the interbank forex market, the local unit opened at 73.05 against the greenback and witnessed an intra-day high of 73.01 and a low of 73.15. During the session, RIL gained 4.1% after its chairman Mukesh Ambani detailed the company’s alternative energy strategy. He was speaking at a global energy conference. As a result, RIL contributed 278 points to the sensex, along with Infosys, Titan and others. Selling in HDFC Bank, HDFC and HUL, among others, limited gains in the index. Had it not been for RIL, the sensex would probably have closed in the red, dealers said. According to Motilal Oswal Financial Services head (retail research) Siddhartha Khemka, liquidity in the domestic market has been strong for the past couple of days with foreign funds’ net-buying at over Rs 6,000 crore in the last four sessions. “Further, strong service PMI data and healthy GST collection numbers boosted market sentiments,” Khemka said. Writing in a post-market note, Khemka referred to India’s services PMI for August — at 56.7, up from 45.4 in July — indicating the fastest growth in over 18 months, while the GST collection remained above the Rs 1-lakh-crore mark for the second consecutive month at Rs 1.12 lakh crore, also for August. Outside of the sensex stocks, HDFC Life Insurance announced it will buy out the promoters in Exide Life Insurance for Rs 6,687 crore through a mix of cash and stocks. HDFC Life stock, however, closed 3.2% lower as market players believe the price was on the higher side. On the other hand, Exide Industries closed 6.3% higher.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sensex-breaches-58k-on-ril-push/articleshow/85910387.cms||---

When asked about it, chief minister Nitish Kumar on Friday shot back, “Should the land be brought from the sky?” Nitish advised the mediapersons to ask the RJD about the situation during its regime and said: “It was only after 2006 that all the recognized parties in Bihar were allotted space for their party offices, as per their choice.” RJD’s state president Jagadanand Singh had written a letter to the chief minister, building construction department minister and officials concerned in March this year demanding allotment of a vacant land adjacent to the RJD’s office. Singh demanded more land on the basis that RJD had the largest number of MLAs. He stated that JD(U) with 43 MLAs has party office spread over 66,000 square feet and BJP with 74 MLAs had its party office in 52,000 square feet area. But RJD with 75 MLAs has party office over 19,842 square feet only. Singh on Friday wrote a similar letter to all of them with the same content. However, sources said the letters could not be received in any of the offices because of delay in sending and will be taken on Saturday. RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav tweeted that the JD(U) office was expanded by demolishing MLAs’ residences. When told that the land which they were demanding belonged to the Patna high court, RJD state spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan replied, “CM has the power to allot. If he wants, he can get another land allot to the high court and the one adjacent to our office to us. CM has added the residence of chief secretary to his own bungalow.” Lalu, Rabri flay govt over price rise: RJD chief Lalu Prasad and his wife and former CM Rabri Devi hit out at the NDA government over the price rice. “Flour, vegetables, fruits, pulses, oil, spices, petrol-diesel, gas, medicine, everything has become expensive. This double-engine government has made even the edible commodities, as well as the process of cooking them expensive. It is only human life which is cheap and goes easily because of hunger, poverty or lynching,” Lalu tweeted. Taking a jibe at BJP’s achche din (good days) slogan, Rabri tweeted that let those bad days return at least, alluding to the previous UPA regime when essential items were available at comparatively cheaper rates in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nitish-hits-back-at-rjd-for-seeking-more-office-space/articleshow/85909491.cms||Sheezan Nezami

And if officials are to be believed, the viral fever spread by mosquitoes is likely to continue for a couple of months more. Apart from the 659 cases being reported till Friday evening, one person died due to the disease. The actual data of dengue cases may be much higher as rapid tests for dengue are not considered confirmatory and not accounted for. Dengue cases began trickling in early this year and is most likely to continue till November or even December this year. Usually, the cases begin rising in August. At the current rate, the number of total dengue cases may surpass those in the recent years. Sources said that the low number of cases last year could be deceiving in wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. Many with a dengue infection may have tested positive for Covid-19. Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) medical officer, Dr Devesh Patel said that teams of the health department had started working extensively to ensure that mosquito breeding came under control. “The only way out is ensuring breeding sites are taken care of and people protect themselves against mosquitoes,” Patel said. Patel said that despite dengue cases being reported widely and awareness drives, teams still found breeding sites within houses. “The drive promotes ‘your enemy is in your house’, but we find breeding sites in homes even after a dengue case is reported there,” he said. Besides dengue, chikungunya cases are also being reported in the city. However, the number are much lower as compared to dengue cases with 385 cases being reported so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/dengue-continues-to-sting-barodians-30-cases-daily/articleshow/85910012.cms||---

---||Business||HDFC Life acquires Exide’s insurance arm for Rs 6,687 crore||MUMBAI: HDFC Life has agreed to buy Exide Life Insurance for Rs 6,687 crore, of which Rs 726 crore would be paid in cash. The rest would be paid by issuing 8.7 crore shares of HDFC Life to the target company’s parent. This makes it the biggest insurance M&A deal in India. Announcing the acquisition, HDFC Life Insurance CEO Vibha Padalkar said that the core reason behind the deal was its decision to grow its proprietary distribution channel. HDFC Life has developed scale largely on the back of the distribution strength of HDFC Bank. While initially banks were allowed to sell policies of only one company, Irdai has relaxed the rule in recent years.  !function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}(); “Adding 40% to our agency force would have taken 2-3 years. Today, our propriety channel is 15% of our business and we want to increase that to 30-35%. If you look at other parts of Asia, the proprietary channels dominate. Over a period of time, the reliance on bancassurance has gone down and companies have built their tied agency model. That is the core of this deal... to grow our own proprietary channel,” said Padalkar. The acquisition will add 10% to HDFC Life’s embedded value (EV) — a measure for the worth of a life company that takes into account future earnings from policies that the company has issued. The acquisition price is less than 2.5 times the EV of Exide Life. Also, given that Exide Life has a sound solvency position of 225%, it will add to HDFC Life’s solvency. However, the cash payout, when it happens, will have a 15% impact on solvency margins. “There is an advantage if one is trading at expensive valuations. Acquiring a company using your stock becomes less onerous and less of a drag…so, HDFC Life, trading at about 6x trailing EV, used largely its stock, resulting in just 4% dilution and got Exide life which added 10% to EV,” said Macquarie Capital research analyst Suresh Ganapathy. According to Padalkar, the company has a good deal as the average valuation of listed and proxy listed companies (excluding HDFC Life) is 3.5 times their EV, while the deal values Exide Life at less than 2.5. She said that the business would complement that of HDFC Life in terms of geographical distribution as well, since Exide Life is present in tier-3 cities where the acquirer is yet to make inroads. She said that the company was open to more acquisitions as long as it had a credible distribution, a decent sized EV and strong risk management in its DNA. Padalkar said that the first stage of the transaction — turning Exide Life into a wholly owned subsidiary — would take place by December-January. Thereafter, she expected consolidation to take 8-9 months. Exide Life Insurance has its origins as ING Vysya Life Insurance. The company lost both its original promoters — ING, which decided to exit a few years after the global financial crisis in 2013, and Vysya Bank which was acquired by ING and later by Kotak Mahindra Bank. After ING’s exit, the Rajan Raheja-owned auto battery-maker Exide became the owner of Exide Life Insurance. The company was seen to be an acquisition target for several years as it had not managed to achieve scale. Exide on Friday informed the stock exchanges that the total investment of the company in the life subsidiary was Rs 1,679 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hdfc-life-acquires-exides-insurance-arm-for-rs-6687cr/articleshow/85910500.cms||---

As many as 178 of the kids who dropped out of school were from Chamarajanagar town. Poverty, migration, lack of adequate infrastructure at schools and even instances of child marriage are among the reasons for children dropping out of schools in the border district. Many parents cited loss of employment in the wake of the pandemic-induced crisis for pulling their children out of school. The objective of the survey is to ensure that children who have dropped out of schools return to the formal education system. The teachers, enumerators designated by the urban planning department to conduct the survey identified 178 children in the district headquarters. Most of the children who had dropped out of school were traced back to underprivileged sections of the town. While 30 children in Kollegal town dropped out of school, the number was 43 in the areas under the jurisdiction of the Gundlupet Town Municipal Council and six in Hanur.

While a seven-month-old Covid positive boy from Bihta in Patna was admitted to AIIMS-P last Tuesday, a four-year-old girl from Mirzapur village in Saran district, who too tested positive for the virus, was admitted on Friday. The condition of the two kids, however, was stable. The girl who was admitted to AIIMS-P on Thursday has been suffering from fever and difficulty in breathing. Meanwhile, the death of the 11-year-old girl, Aarohi Kumari, due to Covid has worried young parents as schools have resumed offline classes at full strength in the city. A committee of experts, constituted by the National Institute of Disaster Management, had earlier suggested better medical facilities for children as the third wave of Covid might hit the country. Aarohi, a resident of Gosai Tola in Patna, had died three hours after reaching the hospital. AIIMS-P nodal incharge for Covid, Dr Sanjeev Kumar, said the girl’s parents had brought her to the hospital thinking that she had viral fever. “The girl’s antigen test report came positive and she died three hours after admission,” Dr Kumar said, adding a seven-month-old Covid positive child is also undergoing treatment at the hospital. Dr Kumar said the OPD of AIIMS-P has been witnessing a spurt in viral fever cases among children. The death of Aarohi and rise in viral fever cases have worried parents. Ruhi Parween, mother of two daughters, said, “My daughters have started going to school. I am worried as they intermingle with several people from different localities.” Noted paediatrician Dr Arun Shah said parents and school authorities should take all the precautions. “Everyone on the campus, from children to staff, should wear masks. Schools should ensure that all the staff are fully vaccinated. Even bus drivers and conductors should be fully vaccinated. There should be proper arrangement for sanitization at all the educational institutions,” he added. Dr Shah said there has been a rise in cases of viral fever among children. “Many children are suffering from influenza, acute bronchitis and gastroenteritis. All such patients don’t need antibiotics. However, when the children complain of difficulty in breathing and vomiting, they should be taken to the doctor,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/concern-as-11-year-old-girl-succumbs-to-covid-at-aiims-patna-2-kids-test-positive/articleshow/85908656.cms||Sheezan Nezami

The company had been cautioning the public on unscrupulous elements cheating them in the name of recruitment. A recent victim is a MTech mechanical engineering graduate as well as several others, who paid a conman, a taxi driver from Sullia. The fraudster has gone incommunicado after taking Rs 7-8 lakh from each job aspirant. What is more interesting is that the fraudster has MRPL letterheads, appointment letters and ID cards, which resemble the original one. “A year ago, I met Shivanand Prabhu, a resident of Sullia, when he was working for a bike taxi firm in Mangaluru. He claimed that he is employed at Mescom, and took my number. Somewhere around March this year, he called up and said that he is now employed at MRPL. He also added there are some vacancies that suit my qualification, and demanded that I should pay some advance in order to stop newspaper advertisements. Without thinking twice I paid him some money in advance. Later, I met him at a restaurant and also outside MRPL in Surathkal. He demanded more money, and said that it will be shared among three other employees of MRPL. I paid him close to Rs 7.6 lakh, after borrowing from my friends on different occasions. Prabhu also sent fake MRPL appointment letters and identity card of my appointment, to gain my trust. When I realised that I was cheated, I demanded the money back. He managed to return about Rs 1.2 lakh in several transactions. However, Prabhu went incommunicado from the past few weeks. He has also cheated several others with the same modus operandi,” said the victim. The victim has filed a complaint at the Sullia police station, and an investigation is on. Dakshina Kannada superintendent of police Rishikesh Sonawane said that he will look into the issue. “We can carry out an investigation only if victims provide us with the complete details about the job scam.” “Victims are advised to file a complaint in such cases,” said N Shashi Kumar, city police commissioner, Mangaluru. M Venkatesh, MD, MRPL said that company has addressed the issue with police for investigation. “We have received 2-3 fraud complaints in the past two weeks,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/despite-mrpls-warning-many-victims-fall-for-job-frauds/articleshow/85907106.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

He is expected to be fully cured by September 10. The SJS is a deadly disease whose symptoms include high fever, rashes on the skin, pain in the joints and severe burning sensation on the skin, after which the skin begins to peel off. “It is a rare disease, when your own limbs begin to work against you. Initially, it was difficult to diagnose,” Dr Jaiswal had said on Thursday on his Facebook account. However, Dr Jaiswal in a statement on Friday said, “Even at present, there is grade-one burn on my skin.

Travel and tour operators in the city claimed that the most preferred destinations in the ensuing tourist season (September- November) include Gujarat, Sikkim, Leh-Ladakh, Kashmir, Kerala, Andaman and Nicobar and Goa. For international travel, Maldives is the most preferred destination, said Amit Pandey, chief executive officer (CEO) of a travel company said. The travel and tourism industry has been affected severely by the Covid-19 pandemic since the last two years. However, after almost a year and a half, the industry is hopeful of good business this year. They are eagerly waiting for September to pass positively without any traces of the third wave. “People are happy and getting their bookings done for trips outside Bihar or even abroad,” said Ranveer Jaiswal, the owner of a tour and travel agency at Patliputra Colony. “Currently, we are getting 40-50% of the bookings made in the pre-Covid era,” said Saurabh Khemka, the proprietor of a travel agency at Fraser Road. “The response is quite positive as people love to go out. Those coming back from a trip give a positive feedback as they felt rejuvenated after months of lockdown,” said Rakesh Kumar, proprietor of another travel agency at Mithapur. The travel agencies in the city say they are ensuring that the travellers are vaccinated against Covid before travelling and carry their RT-PCR reports or certificates of the vaccination. The agencies are also providing a list of protocols to follow in order to ensure a safe and healthy travelling. “From Bihar, people are inclined to go out for a vacation of approximately 2-3 weeks,” said SK Singh, managing director of a tour and travel agency near Gandhi Maidan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/travel-agencies-hopeful-of-positive-season-this-year/articleshow/85908578.cms||---

Organizing secretaries of all RSS-affiliated outfits, including BJP’s BL Santosh, are learnt to have reached Nagpur for the meet. The RSS, which has preferred not to comment on the proceedings, dubs it as an informal get-together that happens each year in September. This time, the meet coincides plans of protests by Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS) — the trade union arm of the RSS and also Kisan Sabha — farmers’ body. The Kisan Sabha protests will be held on September 8 demanding a law on minimum support price (MSP) followed by BMS against rising prices of all essential commodities. A senior functionary of the RSS contacted by TOI said the discussions were informal and not for public consumption. “All the issues that are of national importance are certainly discussed, although in an informal manner,” said the source. Independent RSS observer and also a veteran swayamsevak Dilip Deodhar said the meet would be discussing a whole gamut of issues from the forthcoming assembly polls in five states — Uttar Pradesh, Punjab Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur — to also having a more liberal image of the Sangh. The discussions would include Mumbai civic polls too, with plans drawn to defeat Shiv Sena. Plans are expected to be drawn considering the political developments in Punjab and in the light of Akali Dal walking out of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), said Deodhar. He also claimed that Sangh Parivar is also planning to increase its presence in the cooperative sector through its arm — Sahakar Bharati. At present, the sector is dominated by NCP and Congress in Maharashtra, he added. Even the developments in Afghanistan are expected to be discussed during the meet, in the light of its impact on India. There is a section in the RSS, which leans towards a more radical ideology, but there are also a view to change the image as against a general perception of being against Muslims, said Deodhar. The meet may discuss proposals on changing the history curriculum and making it more nationalistic, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/sangh-parivar-2-day-coordination-meet-starts-in-nagpur/articleshow/85910058.cms||Shishir Arya

Palasi police station SHO Shiv Pujan Kumar said one Md Muhtessem visited his in-laws’ house at around 2am and set it ablaze, causing severe burn injuries to his father-in-law, mother-in-law and their two children. The villagers had spotted the accused and his accomplices carrying a plastic container, but didn’t intervene. The accused managed to escape after setting the house aflame. Muhteseem’s mother-in-law Marzeena (45) and her son Abuzar (10) died on way to the hospital. His father-in-law Md Irshad (50) and sister-in-law Shaista (12) were undergoing treatment at Jawahar Lal Nehru Medical College and Hospital in Bhagalpur. The villagers told the police that Irshad’s son-in-law Muhtessem was involved in the crime. The SHO said marital dispute was stated to be the reason behind the incident. Muhtessem, a resident of Farsadangi village in Araria district, had pronounced triple talaq on his wife Nanhi Begum about a fortnight ago following an altercation. But, later, he was insisting on taking his wife back, probably apprehending trouble over the triple talaq issue. Irshad, However, did not allow him to take her back and sent his daughter to a relative’s place. Nanhi was married to Muhtessem about two years ago. Police said Muhtessem was absconding after the incident. Araria Sadar SDPO Pushkar Kumar said a special police team had been set up to crack the case. “Irshad had sent his daughter to his relative’s house after the divorce, which might have enraged his son-in-law who committed the crime,” he told this newspaper over phone. The residents said Irshad had submitted a petition to the local police station apprehending an attack on the family after the divorce issue. They blamed the police inaction for the gory incident in which two people died and two others suffered burn injuries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/two-die-as-man-sets-in-laws-house-ablaze-in-araria/articleshow/85908712.cms||Ramashankar

The CM also inspected construction work of multi-purpose ‘Prakash Kendra’ and its “udyan” (garden) on the ‘Prakash Punj’ premises and enquired about the ongoing works from the officials concerned. “The Prakash Punj, which also comprises Prakash Kendra and its garden, is being built at a cost of Rs 54 crore to keep the memory of 350th ‘Prakash Parv’ of Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth Sikh Guru, which was celebrated here,” a building construction department (BCD) official told TOI on Friday. The Guru Ka Bagh is related to Guru Gobind Singh, who was born in Patna in 1666 to Guru Teg Bahadur, the ninth Sikh guru, and Mata Gujri. The Bihar government had organised an 11-day programme on a grand scale from December 26, 2016 to January 5, 2017 to mark the 350th birth anniversary of the 10th Sikh guru in Patna. Nitish had laid the foundation stones for the Prakash Punj, Prakash Kendra and the garden during the three-day ‘Shukrana Samaroh’ (thanksgiving) of 350th Prakash Parv on December 23, 2017. In September 2018, the CM had inaugurated the commencement of construction work for the Prakash Punj and its allied buildings. While inaugurating the construction work, the CM had asked the BCD officials to complete the project in the next 14 months. “However, the work got delayed due to the Covid-induced lockdowns,” the BCD official said. While inspecting the construction works, the CM asked the BCD officials to ensure planting of saplings of selected trees along the perimeter of the Prakash Punj. He also issued instructions for construction of a pathway, using the paver blocks, around the pond located in front of the main gate. As a rail line crosses after the pond, Nitish asked the officials to construct a boundary wall outside the pond to ensure safety of the visitors. The CM also ordered construction of a road on the outer side of the pond for the convenience of the visitors. Nitish also inspected the Prakash Bhawan being constructed for the stay of the tourists. After inspection of the construction works, a presentation was made before the CM on the exhibits, side planning and content planning inside the Prakash Punj. Accompanied by senior officials of different departments, Nitish also inspected the premises of Gulzarbagh government press building. He held discussions with experts and officials over archaeological excavation in the Patna City area and also gave certain instructions to them. The CM also inspected the premises of the BNR Teachers’ Training College and held discussions on the proposed archaeological excavation there. The CM said this place was once called Pataliputra. “Its history is 2000-year old. If we get some information through excavation, a large number of tourists would visit this place,” the CM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nitish-for-excavations-in-patna-city-area/articleshow/85909394.cms||Madan Kumar

Dhule resident Mohammad Rafique, who travels to Bhiwandi on the national highway on a two-wheeler for his business, said, “I have to be extra vigilant while negotiating the ghat section of the highway at Igatpuri. The stretch is a nightmare.” A visit to the ghat section by TOI revealed that the parts of the road have worn out and potholes mark many parts of the stretch. Stone gravel is strewn all over. What is more agonising is the absence of crash barriers in some parts of the highway stretch. Additional director general of Maharashtra Highway Police, Bhushan Kumar Upadhyay, admitted that the ghat section was not in a good shape. “The Nashik highway police division has got in touch with the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) about the measures to be taken,” he said. Nashik highway police said during monsoon, the ghat section would be treacherous for vehicles. On an average, the section witnesses three serious accidents in a month and about 15 instances of heavy vehicles breaking down. “We have been writing to the NHAI on the need to have crash barriers and proper boundary walls,” said an officer. Project director of NHAI’s Nashik division, B S Salunke, said: “I have served an ultimatum to the contractor that the NHAI would impose hefty fines if complaints continue to come about the poor condition of the road.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-10km-kasara-ghat-stretch-a-motorists-nightmare-in-rains/articleshow/85914081.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

Both Jardalu mangoes and Katarni rice are agricultural legacy of the farming communities of this region,” Pawan said. BAU vice-chancellor Arun Kumar said the Department of Post has taken a commendable step for the promotion of the Jardalu mangoes and Katarni rice of Bhagalpur. “The postal stamps will draw attention of people across the states and the world. The step would assist in finding a bigger platform and wider market network for the two products,” he said. Jardalu mango received prestigious Geographical Indication (GI) tag in 2018 due to its exceptional quality, sweetness and fragrance. The state government sends Jardalu mangoes as a gift to the country’s dignitaries, including the President of India, Vice-President, Prime Minister, Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha Speakers, chief ministers and other VVVIPs every year. Similarly, ‘Katarni rice’, exclusively grown in the villages under Jagdishpur block of Bhagalpur district and adjacent Rajoun block in Banka district of the state, has a unique aroma.

The arrested persons revealed to the police their plan to kill a candidate for the district board member post in the upcoming elections for panchayati raj institutions. Mohan Kumar Maurya told the interrogators that he was offered a contract to supply illegal weapons for the upcoming panchayat polls by one J P Yadav, a murder accused and complainant of a triple murder at Rupanchak village in the district. Maurya, stated to be a resident of Shahpur Patori under Bibhutipur police station area in Samastipur district, revealed that Yadav was planning to attack incumbent district board chairman Mukesh Pandey during campaigning. Hathua SDPO Naresh Paswan said on Friday that the police foiled a major incident during the panchayat election in the district. He said the police raided a mini gun factory at Madarwani village under Phulwaria police station area and also recovered foreign currency from the possession of those arrested. Mukesh, the nephew of JD(U) MLA from Kuchaikot Amrendra Kumar Pandey alias Pappu Pandey, is lodged in jail in connection with the Rupanchak killings. He is the son of underworld don Satish Pandey. On Wednesday, the JD(U) MLA held a workers’ meeting at Hathua and appealed to the people of the area to support Mukesh, who has falsely been implicated in a triple murder case. “Mukesh is a formidable candidate in the upcoming election,” he told the gathering.

As only light to moderate rainfall is expected in Nepal and Bihar, the falling trend of the water level of the rivers is expected to continue. The water discharge through Birpur barrage across the Kosi and the Valmikinagar barrage across the Gandak, though, increased on Thursday. The discharge through the Birpur barrage increased to 2.11 lakh cusecs and through the Valmiki Nagar barrage 1.86 lakh cusecs in the morning to 2 lakh in the afternoon, according to the flood bulletin of the water resources department. The water levels of all other rivers like the Bagmati, Kamla, Ganga and Mahananda showed the falling trend, even as the Bagmati was flowing 1.18m above the danger level at Benibad and 1.46m at Hayaghat. The water level of the Ganga also showed falling trend at Digha and Gandhi Ghat in Patna, while there was rising trend from Hathidah onwards up to Farakka, with the water level being 71cm above the danger level at Kahalgaon and 80cm at Farakka. However, the flood situation has remained grim in East Champaran district. A total of 50 houses, temples and government primary school building of Sakhawa Tok village of Areraj block were washed away by the Gandak on Wednesday. Around 275 villagers, including children, have taken shelter on the Saran embankment in Gopalganj district. East Champaran DM Shirshat Kapil Ashok said the SDM of Areraj has been asked to provide all help and relief materials to the affected villagers. The Gopalganj DM said some people of East Champaran district had taken shelter on the Saran embankment. At Bagaha in West Champaran district, CPI(ML) MLA from Sikta Birendra Prasad Gupta said the government had failed to provide succour to the flood-affected people. “Floodwaters have damaged paddy and sugar cane crops in the district,” he said, adding deputy CM Renu Devi, who hails from the district, should have paid attention to the concerns of the flood-hit people as she also holds the disaster management department portfolio.

---||Business||More NRIs buy term life covers from desi insurers||CHENNAI: Post-pandemic demand for life cover in India from NRIs has risen thanks to low term insurance rates which continue to be competitive despite an increase in rates by some insurers following the Covid-19 outbreak. Bajaj Allianz Life has seen its NRI premium income during the period April 21 to June 21, grow 59% over the same period last year. In absolute numbers, the increase is from Rs 115 crore in 2020 to Rs 182 crore in 2021. According to Chugh, this is because overseas rates are on average 20% higher than what customers pay in India. Depending on where the NRI resides, they may find Indian term insurance rates cheaper by 20-50. Exide Life Insurance, which has a smaller base, has seen its NRI premium double to Rs 20 crore in April-August, 21 from April-August 20. The company’s director of strategy Sanjay Tiwari said “Despite premium rates having gone up post the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic, it is still 40%-50% cheaper to purchase a term policy in India.” He adds that the high settlement ratio of 98.54% also reassures buyers. “We see NRI demand from other Asian countries and Europe as well, but it is largely driven by those working in the UAE,” Tiwari added. According to agents, those NRIs having dependent families or outstanding home loans in India are more likely to buy term cover here than those settled abroad. Sajja Praveen Chowdary, head of term life insurance, Policybazaar.com says the premium paid for purchasing a term life cover in India is cheaper by 20%-40%, as compared to any other country. Chowdary says. The only downside is that NRIs (except those in UAE and Singapore) have to bear the cost of pre-acceptance medical tests. These tests are particularly expensive in US and European nations and insurers are unwilling to reimburse them. Premium on term covers has risen by 25% post-pandemic. Re-insurers have taken a tough stance on accepting covers especially after the devastating impact of the second Covid wave on human life.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/wealth/nri/more-nris-buy-term-life-covers-from-desi-insurers/articleshow/85909493.cms||Mamtha Asokan

The complainant met Pandore to reactivate the number for which the accused demanded Rs 2 lakh and instructed him to meet Kishore. The complainant paid Rs 50,000 initially. Later he requested to reduce the bribe amount and the accused agreed to accept Rs 1 lakh. The complainant then contacted ACB. After receiving Rs 1 lakh from the complainant Kishore called Pandore from his phone and informed him that the money had been paid. The complainant too talked with Pandore from Kishore’s phone and confirmed payment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/sgst-deputy-commissioner-aides-caught-taking-rs-1l-bribe/articleshow/85910727.cms||---
---||Dehradun||U’khand cricket body sets up panel to probe player selection||Dehradun: The Cricket Association of Uttarakhand (CAU) has set up an internal committee to look into alleged irregularities in the selection of a player after his name was included in the shortlist of state cricket teams of both Uttarakhand and Delhi. According to rules, a cricketer can only represent one state in a particular season. The initial shortlist of players for Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy (2021-22), a T20 competition scheduled later this year, was released by the two states last month. Earlier as well, the association had faced allegations of irregularities in player selection after the then Uttarakhand cricket coach, Wasim Jaffer, wrote to the association in February, claiming interference and bias from CAU officials and “promotion of undeserving players”. The officials had then accused Jaffer, the all-time highest run-scorer in Ranji Trophy, of choosing players based on their religion. Many cricketers had sprung to Jaffer’s support. Following the controversy, Jaffer resigned and is now coaching the Odisha cricket team. Sanjay Gusain, spokesperson of the CAU, maintained that there were no “irregularities”. “Hundreds of players come for trials and it is not possible for us to know whether they are participating only in one state board’s trial or many. We have formed a committee to look into the matter,” he said. Gusain said that this was an initial shortlist which would further be trimmed to 15 players. "We vet the credentials of all players before releasing the final list," he said. This year, two selection camps were held by the association — one in Dehradun and another in Kashipur. “Both camps released a list of around 150 shortlisted players each,” he said. One of the players who made the cut in Kashipur also figured in a list of 52 players released by Delhi District Cricket Association (DDCA). A CAU official said that players have to fulfil certain criteria before appearing for trial. "They should have the domicile of the state or should have completed schooling in that state apart from having played a certain number of organised tournaments," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-cricket-body-sets-up-panel-to-probe-player-selection/articleshow/85907616.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||Nagpur||War of words between Cong, BJP continues over city’s devpt||Nagpur: The war of words between local units of Congress and BJP over the city's development continues. A day after senior BJP corporator Avinash Thakre flayed Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government for delaying development works, Congress city chief Vikas Thakre on Friday came out with a new list of works announced by the saffron party over its 15 years rule in Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), but never completed. Before it, BJP city president and MLC Pravin Datke slammed the grand old party for destroying the city over the years and predicted that the citizens would reward its leaders with defeat in next year’s civic polls. Earlier, on August 31, Thakre accompanied by MLC Abhijit Wanjari and Umakant Agnihotri had targeted Union minister Nitin Gadkari and BJP ruled NMC while listing out a slew of works either only on paper, incomplete or wrapped up midway due to unviability. Terming BJP’s tenure of one-and-a-half decade as “misrule”, the West Nagpur MLA on Friday demanded accounts of various schemes announced by the BJP in the last 15 years. “Its leaders made tall announcements about various schemes. But how many are complete? Its office bearers must give details to the people, who have trusted them since the last three polls.” Thakre in his statement listed out 22 works which were announced but were still on paper or incomplete. Besides major ones like Nag river rejuvenation, 24x7 water scheme and London (Orange) street, it included projects like ‘Khau Galli’ and beautification of city’s lakes like Gandhi Sagar, Futala, Pandhrabodi, Sakkardara and Naik Talao, that were started with much fanfare, but failed due to poor implementation. “What happened to projects like ‘Tender Sure’ and ‘home-sweet-home’ proposed under the Smart City project? The 24x7 water supply scheme is the biggest scam in the corporation. They declared it would be completed project by 2018, but even three years later, it’s far from complete. Not a single locality is getting round the clock water. The widening of Old Bhandara Road is yet to be completed while project of laying all MSEDCL power lines underground is still on paper. They have also announced setting up of an isolation hospital in the city and assembly constituency wise hospitals, but no progress has been made in this regard,” the MLA told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/war-of-words-between-cong-bjp-continues-over-citys-devpt/articleshow/85910141.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

The civic body plans to install six screens each, measuring 150cm in height and 100cm in breadth, at two places. Installation of six screens has been completed and testing is underway. Covid-19 awareness messages are now being displayed. “Information to be conveyed to the public will be displayed on the screens. They also will be used to create awareness. Live update of air quality in the area and weather information will also be displayed,” said a corporation official. “It is an attempt to engage more than 1,500 people who visit the place a day for leisure and fitness purposes.” Another 12 screens will be installed on the walking track, an official with the corporation’s engineering wing said. “People can walk on them. The walking track is about 2.6km long. The screens will be installed 215 metres apart so that walkers can count the distance they covered. The screens will display distance and time. Six of them have been installed, but testing is yet to be done,” he said. The civic body took up the model road project at Race Course last year at a cost of Rs 40.7 crore to modify it to suit pedestrian movement and to increase amenities for visitors. Revamping of the men’s gym, setting up a gym for women and conversion of the children’s park into an amphitheatre were part of the project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/giant-led-screens-to-display-information-at-race-course/articleshow/85912559.cms||V Devanathan

The patient, who is a 28-year-old person from the city, was taken to the institutional isolation facility at MLA Hostel immediately. TOI spoke to the patient who decided to cooperate with the authorities and remain in the Covid care centre (CCC) for the sake of the well-being of his family and neighbours. The youngster told TOI over phone that he was having some Covid-like symptoms for last two days, so he went for testing on Thursday. “Today, I got a call from Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) health department that my report was positive and their team will shift me to the CCC at MLA hostel,” the patient said.A team from NMC shifted him to the CCC while two other teams immediately started the process of contact tracing. An NMC official who led one of the teams told TOI that they have taken swab samples of all family members of the patient, including a child, and all residents from nearby buildings. After getting further details from the youth, the NMC collected samples of people who came in contact with the patient in the last four-five days. Overall, more than 150 samples were collected. The treating doctor said the patient is doing well. “He had mild fever in the morning but now the temperature is normal. Rest, proper and timely food, lots of fluids and vitamins are the basic treatment line for this patient. The review will be conducted every day now,” said the doctor. Interestingly, the patient had taken one dose of the vaccine and his second dose was due in the second week of September. All his family members, except the child, are fully vaccinated. No one has any symptom of Covid-19. The patient told TOI that he has not travelled out of Nagpur for more than a year. “I remember visiting a crowded vegetable market a week ago where I guess I was infected. But I am not sure about it,” he said. NMC officials said that contact tracing and testing more and more people is their agenda. “We are happy that the patient readily agreed to stay in institutional quarantine. This is for the safety of family and friends. We have enough facilities for patients and proper arrangement here,” said the in-charge official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/lone-covid-patient-on-fri-agrees-to-institutional-isolation-for-familys-sake/articleshow/85907618.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Pune||Maharashtra deputy CM Ajit Pawar wants focus on rural localities registering high weekly positivity rate||PUNE: Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Friday told the administration to increase Covid testing and vaccination in the rural areas that have reported a 4.8% weekly positivity rate (WPR) as against the district’s average of 4.01%. The weekly positivity rates in areas under the Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad civic bodies were 3.2% and 3.4%, respectively. Expressing concerns over people, especially in the rural areas, letting their guard down, Pawar urged citizens to follow the Covid protocols and not to put the government in a position where it has to shut everything ahead of a possible third wave of the pandemic. “It has been noticed that people in the rural areas are becoming lax in terms of following Covid protocols and physical distancing and adhering to the face mask norms. They are assuming that Covid is over and this has led to the rise in infections. I have been told that the administration will increase testing this week and the focus will again be on vaccination,” he told the media. The rural parts of the district recently achieved the feat of 1.94 lakh vaccinations in a day and the administration has been directed to scale up the inoculation programme with more doses coming. “ aramati, Indapur, Ambegaon, Shirur and Junnar talukas have registered high positivity and the administration will be focussing on these talukas,” he said. While the first initiative on tying up with the local administration tying up with the industries saw a huge response on Wednesday, he said such drives could yield good results in future. “More such tie-ups should be done,” he added. The district till date has registered 82 lakh vaccinations. On the preparation of a possible third wave, he said the district was ready with infrastructure and allotted funds so that both the jumbo hospitals did not have to be closed. Pune collector Rajesh Deshmukh said they have intensified testing in these talukas and have intensified surveillance activities by identifying hotspot areas and conducting tests. Zilla Parishad CEO Ayush Prasad said they have identified 91 villages as “hotspot villages” as on September 1. A village with over 10 active cases is declared a “hotspot”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/deputy-cm-wants-focus-on-rural-localities-registering-high-wpr/articleshow/85912498.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Association president M V Ramachandra Reddy said private schools are going through a severe financial crunch due to Covid-19, and are not even in a position to pay salaries to teaching staff. “With the fee fixed by the government, we can not provide quality education to students,” he said. The joint action committee of the private school managements said all schools would be closed on Saturday in protest against the fee fixation GO. APPSMA chairman K S N Murthy said 11 school correspondents committed suicide while 40 others succumbed to Covid-19 in the last two years. “ With the fee structure prescribed by the government, we can not run the schools. The government has been spending nearly Rs 70,000 on each student studying in government schools, but it has fixed the fee for private schools in the range of Rs 10,000 to Rs 18,000,” Murthy alleged. The private schools body also found fault with fixing of fees based on the area and location of the school, contending that schools in rural areas cannot provide necessary infrastructure with this fee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/pvt-schools-demand-rollback-of-fee-fixation-go/articleshow/85910123.cms||---

---||Delhi||Northeast Delhi riots case: Umar Khalid alleges bid to create bias by police||NEW DELHI: Former JNU student leader Umar Khalid, booked under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in connection with the northeast Delhi riots, on Friday claimed before a city court that the mind of the police officer who wrote the chargesheet was “communal” and the allegations were his “fertile imagination” to defame the movement. During arguments on Khalid’s bail plea before Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat, his counsel, senior advocate Trideep Pais, said public opinion had been shaped in a different way by police by selectively leaking the chargesheet and trying to create an impression that he was guilty. Pais pointed out that the chargesheet claimed that the previous experiences of the key conspirators from “half-baked successes and failures” two weeks ago made them realise that there was a need for secular, gender and media covers. He questioned if it was wrong for women to protest. “Are you going to take away their right to protest because they are women or are they incapable of protesting? Does the movement of any sort have to be driven by men?” he asked. Drawing references to Harry Potter villain Voldemort and the Family Man series, Pais questioned the basis of some of the allegations against Khalid. He asked if the police officer got into Khalid’s mind to know that when Delhi would be thrown to fire, he would keep a safe distance to create the perfect alibi if the controversy ever got exposed. “So, you don’t have evidence to connect him to the crime... The last person who got into someone’s mind was Voldemort in Harry Potter. This police officer must have been inside his mind to have known this, or he should have a credible statement. Nobody says that. It is not even in Umar Khalid’s procured unsigned statement,” the senior counsel stated. Calling the chargesheet “rubbish”, Pais said such statements went into the hands of the media and the irresponsible media treated it as proof. He asked how the police officer was taking a view on the validity of CAA and whether it was acceptable or not. “This chargesheet is not a chargesheet. It is an exercise for defaming people and brushing them with the colour of criminality when there isn’t… There are repeated references to the accused being communal, repeatedly drilling it into everybody’s heads through this,” said the counsel, adding that no accused should have been arrested in the case. The lawyer claimed not a single one of the over 700 witnesses said Khalid agreed to use social media and mobilisation of youths to conduct protests and chakka jam against CAA. “If there is no basis for these facts and you put it in your chargesheet and newsrooms carried it day-in and day-out, who communalised this country? The police,” Pais alleged. Mentioning that the protests against CAA/NRC were secular, but were being given a communal colour, Pais alleged, “It’s almost like having a secular opposition to the CAA is wrong. Police had alleged that the conspirators exploited women. Has a single woman said she was exploited? Have they gone and taken statements from the protesting women? Nothing about it is guerrilla, nothing is strategy.” “Please see that he (police officer) is not writing the script of Family Man. He is writing a chargesheet. If there is anything that is giving it a communal colour, it is the author of the chargesheet,” said Pais.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/khalid-alleges-bid-to-create-bias-by-police/articleshow/85910264.cms||Usha Das
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Pay panel moots raising retirement age of Kerala government employees to 57 years||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The 11th pay revision commission chaired by former IAS officer K Mohandas handed over its report to the government on Thursday. A string of recommendations were made, including increasing the retirement age of government employees from the existing 56 years to 57 years. In the report, the commission recommended that the government can increase the retirement age by one year to temporarily delay the financial commitments to retiring employees. “The retirement age in several other states is much higher than ours. Close to 20,000 employees retire every year in the state. Increasing the retirement age by one year will give a temporary financial relief to the government in terms of disbursing their retirement benefits,” Mohandas told TOI. The commission also recommended that the government should follow a five-day week from Monday to Friday, and while doing so, the office hours should be extended by one hour from 9:30am to 5:30pm. The present timings are from 10am to 5pm. The commission recommended that teachers earning government salaries —in aided institutions— should be selected purely on merit and their selection should be transparent. A Kerala recruitment board for private schools and colleges should be set up in cooperation with the managements of such educational institutions. To ensure transparency, the interviews should be video-graphed. An ombudsman, a retired high court judge to address the complaints regarding the appointments, should be appointed. The compassionate employment system for dependents of those who pass away while in service should be discontinued, as it is not serving the purpose. Even though the dependents should be sufficiently compensated, since this practice reduces the efficiency of the system and reduces chances of those awaiting jobs, it should be completely discontinued, the commission recommended. There should be an internal guideline to appoint PSC members as they should be highlyqualified and experienced personnel since they have to advise the government in promotions and awarding penalties to government employees. The commission recommended that there should be tests for all promotions in government services and there should be a committee chaired by the chief secretary for the promotion of departmental heads. The employees should be given induction training while joining the service, and subsequently, they should be provided in-service training and later, reskilling. The commission recommended that the government should appoint a chief commissioner to ensure that the right to services act is effectively implemented. The government should ensure that appointments to posts of typists, computer assistants, peons and office assistants should be made only after assessing the requirement in each department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/pay-panel-moots-raising-retirement-age-of-govt-employees-to-57-years/articleshow/85910223.cms||---

The CP gave the woman a last chance to reform after her daughter told the CP she felt lonely and insecure as her mother was sent out of the district.The woman has nine cases of bootlegging against her. The cops had externed her for six months in June, after she failed to pay heed to their repeated warnings. The woman was operating from her residence at Timki since 2018.It’s learnt Kumar was busy with his routine work on Thursday when he was surprised to hear a girl had come to meet him. When she kept on insisting that she would meet only the CP, the attendants and constables allowed her inside.Unaware of the girl’s plea, an intrigued Kumar too allowed her to step inside his chamber. “She appeared to me even younger than her age. She started seeking mercy for her mother, who was externed by Tehsil police through DCP’s order,” he said. “She landed up at my office after being prompted by someone. The girl told me she had paid Rs10 to reach my office after requesting an autorickshaw driver,” said the top cop.Kumar said the girl repeatedly assured to ensure her mother would not indulge in illegal activities further, if an opportunity to reform was given to her. “Seeing the girl’s sincere promise that her mother would reform on getting a chance, we decided to consider cancelling the externment order. The legal formalities have been initiated to cancel the externment now,” said Kumar. He added that the police would keep a strict watch on the woman after she returned home.Kumar said he decided to annul the externment on sensing the vulnerability of the teenage girl without her mother.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/13-yr-old-girl-promises-to-reform-mom-gets-cp-to-cancel-externment-order/articleshow/85907655.cms||Soumitra Bose

It has told us to be cautious during the festival period. Opening of religious places may lead to public gathering, which is not advisable,” Pawar said, while speaking with reporters after the Covid review meeting. BJP and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) leaders defended their protests stating that the families and businesses dependent on the places of worship were losing their livelihood due to the closure of religious places. Pawar said the decision on reopening of religious places would be taken by the chief minister, but the demand was untimely. “We are with the religious sentiments of people. As and when the pandemic situation improves, the temples will be reopened,” the DCM said.  Pune unit chief of BJP Jagdish Mulik said they would continue with the demand. “We are in full support of the Centre’s advice. Our demand is to open the religious places. They can be reopened with guidelines for management of visitors,” he said, adding that the state government should not create confusion among people over Union government’s advisory.  “When all the big temples in the country are open, why there are restrictions on these places in Maharashtra?” asked MNS leader Kishor Shinde.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/check-union-advisory-then-seek-temple-reopening/articleshow/85912541.cms||---

---||Meerut||UP man gets life in jail for raping daughter after wife, children turn witness||Meerut: A 48-year-old man was on Friday sentenced to life imprisonment by a court for raping his daughter, 15, during lockdown last year. The case came to light and reached its conclusion due to the perseverance of the survivor’s mother. Additional sessions judge (ADJ) Mumtaz Ali, also the special judge of Pocso court in UP’s Shamli, observed that a father raping his daughter is a “heinous” crime which sends a bad message to the society. The case was registered on the complaint of the accused’s wife, who told the court that she “dealt with abuses and torture for years after her marriage but couldn’t bear what her daughter was going through”. Shaheen (name changed), 45, said that she was a victim of “domestic violence since the day she got married”. Her husband never allowed their six daughters to complete education and married two of them in their teens, she said. “He was a bad father too,” she said. “Mujhe nahi pata tha ye beti ke saath aisa bhi karega (But I never thought that he would do such a thing with his own daughter),” Shaheen told TOI. The woman, who never went to school and can hardly read and write, dragged her husband to the police station and then to court. “I cried all night when my daughter told me about what happened to her. In the morning, the first thing I did was to call the police. I faced taunts from my in-laws. Even the neighbours didn’t spare me. I stood up to all this for the next 16 months,” Shaheen said. "But I don’t care. He should be punished.” Special public prosecutor OP Kaushik told TOI, “The mother of the girl had filed a complaint at Thana Bhawan police station on April 29, 2020. She was sleeping with her daughters in a room when her husband, at around three in the night, called the 15-year-old girl on the pretext of massaging his feet, saying he was in pain. Then he committed the crime and threatened her not to disclose it to anyone.” Shamli police had registered the case under IPC sections 377 (carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman, or animal) and 506 (criminal intimidation) and under relevant sections of the Pocso Act, the government lawyer said. “ The case took this long as the court remained closed for months amid pandemic,” Kaushik said. "We produced seven witnesses in this case, including the daughters and wife of the accused.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/up-man-gets-life-in-jail-for-raping-daughter-after-wife-children-turn-witness/articleshow/85907696.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Nagpur||Local leadership to take call on alliance for NMC polls: Sena MP||Nagpur: Shiv Sena Rajya MP and party national secretary Anil Desai said local leadership in Nagpur shall take a final call on alliance for the 2022 civic polls. Speaking exclusively to TOI, Desai also talked about the party’s plan for growth in Nagpur while delicately balancing the new vs old guard equation. While acknowledging the importance of old timers within the party, Desai made it clear that going forward, youth-driven issues will be at the forefront for Shiv Sena. Desai accepted that the party has not fared well for a long time in various polls held in Nagpur district. “Our performance in this district is not at the level that one would like it to be, with the exception of Ramtek where both legislative assembly and Lok Sabha seats are with us. At the same time, we have noticed increase in voting percentage in many areas but the candidates could not clinch the seats. So, every party has to look carefully at its strategy to approach the polls and increase the chance of winning,” said Desai. The Sena leader, who was a close aide of late Balasaheb Thackeray, continues to play a key role in the party’s organizational setup and acts a bridge between the high command and multiple local units. Desai did not commit on whether the party will go solo for the civic polls next year. “This decision will be taken by the local leadership after considering all options. If an alliance is beneficial, then it could be considered, but there’s no final decision about it yet,” said Desai. Desai did not deny that Sena is now getting ‘younger’ with youth leaders getting key positions. “Over the years, youth leaders under the guidance of Aditya Thackeray have been performing extremely well with more youngsters now getting attracted to Yuva Sena. It’s a natural process where both young faces and those with experience work together to make the party stronger,” said Desai. Shiv Sena is now targetting the key 18-35 age group of voters by promoting younger faces within the party’s organizational hierarchy. Desai said, “This group is voting in higher numbers and has the potential to change the results. Youth leaders have new ideas as they know the new electorate better and our party chief Uddhav Thackeray and Aditya ji have also put trust in them. Plus, we keep getting inputs about this (poll dynamics) from research agencies that we engage. So, this is a natural process and we need to change to according to the times.” While not ignoring party seniors in Nagpur, Desai made it clear that going forward, the party will be driven by youth-related issues. He said, “Experience is the mainstay of the party but we are keeping tabs on the socio-political changes going on in other parties as well. But youth issues are at the forefront because they are very vociferous in their demands, be it related to employment, education etc. We need an organizational setup that is ready to address these issues.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/local-leadership-to-take-call-on-alliance-for-nmc-polls-sena-mp/articleshow/85910253.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

The family members have accused the society staff of negligence. The deceased was identified as Raju of Saronth village in Hathras. Sole breadwinner of his family, he had joined as a driver at Gargi Refrigeration just 15 days ago after being jobless since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. He is survived by his widow and two children. The tragedy took place around 11 am when the man was waiting for a lift at the fifth floor to go down to the ground floor. CCTV footage from the building shows when the lift reached the fifth floor, a man came out of it. The lift channel opened though the car had moved up to the next floor. Raju “stepped” inside, failing to notice this and fell down the shaft. Raju was taken to a private hospital from where he was referred to SN Medical College as his condition was critical. He died during the treatment. Prateek Tower is a residential society and only four families live there. The remaining flats are occupied by private offices. Vikas Kumar, SP (city), said an FIR has been registered under IPC section 304 A (causing death by negligence) against security guard Komal Singh and building supervisor Mukesh Gupta at Hariparwat police station.

The arrested accused have been identified as Amit Kumar of Firozpur village and Jasbir of Shivalik Colony, Ambala City. Police said the accused were produced in court and remanded in two-day police custody. Ambala district deputy civil surgeon Dr Balwinder Kaur filed a complaint and a case was registered against Amit and Jasbir under relevant section. Dr Balwinder Kaur said Karnal district health officials received a tip-off about some persons conducting gender determination tests in Ambala district. She said a joint raiding team of Ambala and Karnal health officials was formed and a decoy customer contacted tout Amit, who told her that the test would be conducted for Rs 32,000 to Rs 35,000. “On Thursday, the decoy customer met Amit and he took her to Saha town in Ambala district. After conducting the gender determination ultrasound test on the woman through a portable machine, Amit handed over a report to her. The woman paid Rs 32,000 to the accused and he came to drop her to Saha Chowk when our team nabbed him,” said Dr Balwinder. She said Rs 18,000 was recovered from Amit at Saha Chowk and he said that he had given Rs 14,000 to Jasbir. “Through Amit, we traced Jasbir, who was also nabbed in Ambala City and Rs 8,000 was recovered while he had already spent Rs 6,000. Upon checking call details of both Amit and Jasbir, it came to light that both were in constant touch with each other.

Those who stood strong mentally during the first as well as second wave, successfully fought and won over Covid-19, even if they were physically fragile and comorbid. On the other hand, depression, anxiety, fear, stigma, stress made many young and physically healthy people lose the battle against the virus.Mental health professionals in Nagpur told TOI that the pandemic has tested everyone’s patience and made everyone aware of the need to seek doctor’s help when needed. People are now more open to take professional help, more vocal, and are sharing more, said doctors. “During the pandemic, people have realized that learning to cope with stressful situations in a mentally healthy way can make them and those around them more resilient. They also realized how family bonding and support gives a feeling of psychological well-being,” said psychiatrist Dr Shrikant Nimbhorkar, immediate past secretary of Vidarbha Psychiatric Association. It was quarantine period that made people realize the importance of being mentally strong, especially when an individual had to stay away from family in isolation. “It was more of a psychological burden for people than physical health,” said Dr Nimbhorkar. At present, when the lockdown is largely over, doctors have observed that more people are coming for professional psychiatric help than before. “Number of patients coming to our OPD has increased by 20-30% post-pandemic,” said psychiatrist Dr Suleman Virani. “Also, people are now more focused on their health — physical and mental both. They are taking time for relaxation and therapy. They devote more time to family and are more considerate of their family members,” he added.Doctors said that patients are coming for advice regarding simple things like how to cope with Covid fear, how to get rid of intrusive thoughts coming again and again, and what should be done to keep individuals and family mentally fit. A free mental health helpline launched by city psychiatrists during Covid time was a super hit and used to receive hundreds of calls daily. “Earlier, people used to hesitate a lot visiting a psychiatrist for help. This was due to either unawareness or due to stigma. But, the pandemic has made a significant number of people overcome this hesitation,” said consultant psychiatrist Dr Abha Bang Soni. “Women especially suffered a lot of mental stress during the Covid-19 period. Lockdown, followed by work from home and online schools increased their workload like never before and it’s difficult for them to get any me-time. A number of women are accepting this situation, sharing their problems, which is a good sign,” she said. The pandemic may have played havoc on several fronts, but for sure, it has made a majority of people realize that mental health issues can affect anyone anytime irrespective of age, caste, social status.BOXTHE MIND GAME Being mentally strong is a lot more important than being physically strongMany talked openly about emotional struggles during Covid periodThis helped remove stigma attached to mental health problems Women, children, senior citizens are seeking doctors’ help for psychiatric problemsPeople realized that stress, anxiety, depression are treatable and we can get over it Building mental strength is an ongoing process, so meditation, relaxation, exercise, me-time, family-time also earned their own space in people’s lives||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/pandemic-taught-the-importance-of-being-mentally-strong/articleshow/85907683.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Agra||Farmers gather forces for ‘largest Mahapanchayat’ in Muzaffarnagar on September 5||MUZAFFARNAGAR/AGRA: On September 5, farmers across the country will come together under the banner of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) in Muzaffarnagar for what they have said will be their"biggest mahapanchayat” so far. The gathering of farmers protesting against the three new farm laws will mark the beginning of “campaign mode”, farm leaders said, for the UP and Uttarakhand elections. Coming days after at least 10 farmers were allegedly injured in a police lathicharge during protests at Karnal in Haryana on August 28, the mahapanchayat has gained an urgency and momentum of its own. A video of the SDM purportedly asking cops to “break the heads” of protesters had then gone viral, after which the Haryana deputy CM had sought action against him. “Farmers from across the country, including Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and the southern states, will be arriving. Thousands of farmers from across UP started moving towards Muzaffarnagar on Friday. We have planned arrangements for 5 lakh,” said Yudhvir Singh, national general secretary of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU). “But the number might exceed that. And a lot of women will join.” Police had a more conservative estimate. “We expect a 70,000-strong gathering. To manage such crowds, deployment of forces is a standard operating procedure,” Muzaffarnagar SSP Abhishek Yadav said. The forces include six companies of Provincial Armed Constabulary and two of Rapid Action Force, and 1,200 policemen. “Drone cameras will be used for aerial surveillance and 200 CCTV cameras have been installed,” the SSP added. For the Muzaffarnagar mahapanchayat, 2,500 volunteers will work to keep things running and “ensure peace”. “SKM will officially declare its 'Mission UP and Uttarakhand' at the mahapanchayat on Sunday. We will appeal to farmers and other voters to defeat BJP in the elections. The event is also an attempt to unite farmers across castes and religions, and show our strength. The farmers’ protest will intensify,” SKM leader Gurnam Singh Charuni said. Preparations are afoot on a grand scale. Over 20 LED screens and microphones are being set up in a 4-km radius from the venue, Government Inter College Ground. From Saturday, 500 langars will start operating in Muzaffarnagar and surrounding areas. Another 500 mobile langars, tractors carrying food and drinking water, will ply routes leading up to Muzaffarnagar. Those coming in for the mahapanchayat from outside Muzaffarnagar can put up at one of over 20 banquet halls booked by the farmers’ body. Also in place will be 100 medical camps, 50 ambulances and a temporary hospital to address any medical emergency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/farmers-gather-forces-for-largest-mahapanchayat-on-sep-5/articleshow/85910259.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Mumbai||Consult all on monetization pipeline: P Chidambaram||MUMBAI: Senior Congress leader and former Union finance minister P Chidambaram on Friday expressed concern over the National Monetization Pipeline (NMP), saying it was high time the NDA government floated a consultation paper on it, consult workers, trade unions and stakeholders before declaring it. Chidambaram said it was expected that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will discuss the plan to mobilize Rs 6 lakh crore in Parliament and consult Opposition parties in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. Interacting with media, Chidambaram raised 20 questions for the Prime Minister. “The NDA government is obliged to answer these questions in larger public interest,’’ he said. Chidambaram said Modi must clearly spell out objectives of NMP, and if mobilizing revenue was its sole objective. “Certain assets have been identified by NMP for monetization. What are the criteria applied for choice of assets, in case of roads/highways, there is a PPP policy. What is the difference between the model in force for such PPPs and model that will be adopted under NMP?’’ he asked. Chidambaram pointed out that while PM does not entertain the media, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman interacts with the media, but always it’s a monologue. “She does not like to take questions from the media. She makes a statement and quickly leaves,’’ Chidambaram said. Chidambaram, a Rajya Sabha member from Maharashtra, said if an asset is monetized for 30 or 50 years, what is the value of the piece of paper that declares the government to be its owner, what kind of asset does the government expect will be returned at the end of the period, will it not be a fully depreciated asset worth practically nothing? “NMP is silent on key issues. Will the government stipulate in the contract that the amount of depreciation should be put in the depreciation reserve account, which was used only to maintain, upgrade or add to the asset, so that at the end of the lease, a valuable asset is returned to the government?’’ he said. Chidambaram said if the asset is monetized, will the lessee be obliged to maintain the current level of employment, will the lessee be obliged to continue with the policy of reservation if the policy currently applied to the asset? “It is essential to know if the railways will continue to remain as a strategic sector, as was during the UPA government. We are keen to know if the government has identified core strategic sectors and will remain outside the purview of NMP,’’ he said. Chidambaram said it was expected that the NDA government examines the impact of NMP on prices of goods and services.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/consult-all-on-monetization-pipeline-in-mumbai-chidambaram/articleshow/85914099.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

Justice Devan Ramachandran asked why no strict action is being taken against the practice of demanding ‘nokkukooli’ despite it being banned. In an interim order, the court said complaints relating to demand of ‘nokkukooli’ have been coming before the high court on a regular basis. It is surprising as the state government had issued an order banning such demand from any trade union, the court said. Further, the court said in the order that this would prima facie mean that the government’s order has not been effectively implemented by the competent authorities. The court then directed the government to inform why the ban has not been implemented and to inform about the steps taken by police authorities at various levels to implement the government’s order. State police chief was also made a party by the court in the case. A restaurant operator from Anchal in Kollam had sought police protection against CITU and INTUC demanding ‘nokkukooli’ for unloading materials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/nokkukooli-bad-for-states-image/articleshow/85910338.cms||---

The land on Sirumugai Road is valued about Rs 5 crore. It was used by an individual to run a scrap iron shop. During the approval process, the land was shown as open space reserve and the directorate of town and country planning had approved the plan. However, the promoter did not hand over the land to the local body and rented it out to a commercial activity. Officials said that the land was allotted for a children park and other common purposes of the residents in the locality. Officials from various departments, including engineering wing, health department and town planning, retrieved the land with the help of the local police. The eviction was necessitated as the encroacher refused to vacate the land despite two notices from the municipality. After the encroachment was removed, a fence was put up around the land to ensure that it is not occupied in the future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/encroached-land-worth-rs-5-crore-retrieved/articleshow/85912633.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

A total of 74 deaths due to the infection were recorded in the PMR during the week, which was the lowest since the last 10 days of July. In comparison to last week, the recent week witnessed a drop in Covid casualties in the PMC, PCMC and rural parts — from 2.3% to 1.9%, 0.9% to 0.7% and 1.3% to 0.8%, respectively. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, confirmed that Covid deaths were on the lower side now. Around the same period last year, the monthly mortality rate was about 2.52%, which has now dropped to around 1%. “Despite the slight rise in weekly positivity rate, deaths have come down significantly in the PMR.  Most of the current deaths can be attributed to late admissions leading to delayed medical intervention. Around 80% of such critical cases are from within PMR, while the rest are from other districts,” he said. Deshmukh said PMR’s mortality rate could have been lower since deaths of people from other districts, who came to Pune for treatment, are added to the district’s Covid death tally. “If a Covid positive patient belonging to another district tests positive in Pune, the new case is added to the PMR’s tally and not to that district to which the patient belongs. Similarly, if a Covid patient from another district succumbs to the infection in Pune, the death is added to Pune’s death load. ICMR has instructed all districts to stop migrating data of such outstation cases to their respective districts. Therefore, such cases are added to Pune’s Covid tally,” he explained. Deshmukh said PMR recorded 14 fewer deaths than last week — 74 deaths in the latest week from 88 deaths in the week ending August 25. Dr Madhur Rao, senior deputy medical administrator at KEM hospital, said the hospital had recorded 45 Covid deaths in May this year, 10 in June, 13 in July, and eight in August. “Though Covid admissions have slightly increased since the last week or so, deaths have remained on the lower side. There has been a definite drop in Covid death numbers in comparison to a month or so ago,” Dr Rao said. Dr H K Sale, executive director of Noble Hospital, said only occasional mortalities were being recorded in hospitals currently. “Mortalities have dropped significantly, while the Covid patient count in the hospital has remained constant, at about an average 35-plus since last 10-15||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/covid-fatalities-drop-to-6-week-low-in-pmr/articleshow/85912634.cms||Neha Madaan

She succumbed in a hospital on Friday. The 19-year-old's neighbours - Teetu, his father Chandrabhan and another man Vijay - used to pass lewd remarks and even threatened with kidnap, her father alleged. He also claimed of filing a complaint at the local police station earlier, but it was "ignored". “She was mentally harassed and could not cope with the circumstances and took the extreme step by consuming toilet cleaner around 6 pm on Thursday. We rushed her to a private hospital from where she was referred to SN Medical College. She died today,” the girl's father added. Her mother said that she was in immense pain when she took her last breath and "left us". An FIR has been registered under IPC sections 306 [abetment of suicide] and 511 [punishment for attempting to commit offences punishable with imprisonment for life or other imprisonment] against the three accused on the basis of the father's complaint. SP (West) Agra Satyajeet Gupta said the girl’s statement has been recorded before the magistrate. Two of the three accused — Chandrabhan and Vijay — have been arrested while Teetu is still at large.

The special court for the Tamil Nadu Protection of Interests of Depositors Act issued a non-bailable warrant against the accused as he failed to appear before the court during the verdict. The accused, A G Kumar, of Sivasakthi Nagar at Pazhavanjipalayam in Tirupur, had started a firm, Sri Kuberan, on Rayapuram Main Road on October 1, 2011. He promised the investors that those who were investing Rs 1.5 lakh would get seven emu chicks, a shed to maintain the chicks, Rs 7,000 as monthly maintenance charge for two years and Rs 20,000 as bonus once in a year. In another scheme, for the same investment, investors would get Rs 8,000 as monthly maintenances for two years and Rs 15,000 as bonus once in a year. After two years, the capital will be returned to the investors. In this way, Kumar collected a total of Rs 62.5 lakh from 41 investors for two years. However, Kumar failed to fulfill the promises and absconded. On May 12, 2014, investors lodged complaints with the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) police, Coimbatore. Subsequently, police arrested Kumar, who later came out of jail on conditional bail. Police filed a chargesheet before the special court in December 2016. On Friday, judge A S Ravi pronounced the verdict and slapped a fine of Rs 40 lakh against Kumar. The court also ordered to extend his sentence for two more years, if he fails to pay the fine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/emu-scam-tirupur-man-gets-10-years-in-prison/articleshow/85912665.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Their bodies were trapped in the car and the doors had to be cut to take them out, said C P Singh, station house officer of Nasirpur police station, under whose jurisdiction the accident took place. Harshit Pandey (35), corporate salary manager for the private bank’s Agra cluster (which includes 16 branches), his wife, Jyoti (32), and daughter, Manya, were returning to Agra in their Nexa after meeting their family in Lucknow. “Prima facie, it appears that Pandey fell asleep while driving and rammed into a divider at 6am on Friday. The couple’s family members have been informed,” said the SHO. Pandey’s father, Umesh, a sub-inspector in the Border Security Force (BSF) in Bengaluru, told TOI that he was devastated at the loss of his son. “They were in Alambagh to meet us. I didn’t know this was the last time I would see them,” he said. Pandey’s colleagues said he was transferred from Pune to Agra three months ago. The six-lane Agra-Lucknow expressway has recorded a spate of accidents in the recent past. Just two weeks ago, two people had died and 24 labourers sustained injuries when a bus turned turtle after hitting a divider. According to the ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH), Uttar Pradesh (UP) made up for the largest share — 15% — of the total road accident deaths in the country in 2019.

Ganeshotsav is a grand celebration all over the state and has a special resonance in Pune with thousands of mandals making it a public celebration. Pawar said, “The review meeting on Friday considered imposing curbs ahead of the festivities, but after a discussion with the elected representatives we have decided against it. All the big Ganesh mandals have announced their plans to carry out the ten-day festivities in a subdued manner. Mandals have assured us that they will not put up pandals or tableaux, so people will not move around in large numbers.” But, any crowding , the deputy chief minister said, will lead to the local administration and the police imposing curbs from the very next day. As of now, the state government has not imposed any additional restrictions, and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray will announce further directions ahead of the festivities, he added. Like last year, Pawar said, Ganeshotsav this year too should be a simple celebration. Many of the big mandals in Pune have decided to comply with Covid norms and have urged citizens to celebrate the festival at home. The Union government, citing Kerala that registered over 30,000 cases in one day recently, has already advised the state to maintain vigil and take extra precautions during the forthcoming festive season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/immediate-curbs-if-crowding-on-ganesh-chaturthi-spotted-in-pune-says-dy-cm/articleshow/85912694.cms||---
---||Mumbai||‘Power usage leads to 71% of greenhouse gas emissions in Mumbai’||MUMBAI: The city’s high use of electricity is the biggest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. It is followed closely by the transport sector. Of the overall GHG emissions the energy sector contributes 71% and transport 24%. For the Mumbai Climate Action Plan, the World Resource Institute India, along with BMC set 2019 as the base year for the Greenhouse Gas Inventory. As per the inventory the solid waste sector contributes only 5% to GHG emissions. The recent special report on Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has pointed to two climate change challenges faced by the city: Increasing floods and rising temperatures. In fact, in a presentation to the cabinet, the state environment department has warned that the city may be vulnerable to “wet bulb” temperature if it continues with “business as usual”. “Due to high domestic usage of electricity and 95% of electricity is coal-based, the energy sector is the biggest emitter. In case of transport, in 2019, the estimated vehicle kilometres travel was 806 million across modes, which can be attributed to the high emission of the transport sector,” stated the inventory report of the Mumbai Climate Action Plan. Sulakshana Mahajan, an expert on urban planning, said BMC must revisit its Development Plan-2034. “When it talks of increasing temperature, the civic corporation cannot ignore the city’s build form. Mumbai’s highrises not only consume a huge amount of energy but are also responsible for the heat island effect,” she said. Mahajan said Singapore was witnessing a 1.5 degree Celsius rise in temperature on account of highrises. This, despite it having 33% green cover, an efficient public transport and has protected its buildings with paint that prevent heat absorption. Ashok Datar, a strong proponent of public transport, said, “We are pretending to offer solutions, otherwise we would not have had a coastal road project. It is obvious the coastal road must be scrapped as it is car-centric and environmentally damaging.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/power-usage-leads-to-71-of-greenhouse-gas-emissions-in-mumbai-city/articleshow/85914153.cms||Clara Lewis

They staged a dharna in Sector 25, Chandigarh and marched towards the residence of the Punjab CM when they were stopped by the Chandigarh Police. Teachers from Himachal Pradesh also joined the protest. Hundreds of teachers from different colleges of Chandigarh and Punjab gathered at the rally ground located in Sector 25. PFUCTO secretary Dr Jagwant Singh said, “Punjab government had notified the 6th Punjab Pay Commission award and Chandigarh had also endorsed it for its employees. But the UGC pay scales that were to be announced with the Pay Commission award are nowhere in sight. Teachers are the only ones now whose pay-scales are yet to be revised. This is causing immense anxiety and hardship to university and college teachers of Punjab and Chandigarh.” Teachers Association members said the protest would continue till their demands were met. PUTA president Dr Mrityunjay Kumar said, “The seventh pay commission of UGC has been implemented in all other states but due to non-implementation by the Punjab government, teachers are also waiting for it for many years. It is unfortunate that earlier, in their discussions with the department, the response was positive but without any progress. They had been impressing upon the Punjab Government and the Chandigarh Administration to do the needful but to no avail.” The matter has been raised in front of the Punjab Finance Minister to the Speaker and even the Chief Minister regarding the whole matter, but till now only empty assurances have been received from the government. Recently, during the Punjab Vidhan Sabha session, a delegation of teachers met the speaker and spoke about the immediate action taken on the demands of the teachers. There is also opposition to the dealing with the UGC scale on behalf of Puta and Pfacto. Due to this the appointment of a new assistant professor will also harm the youth On Friday, at the rally ground, the teachers raised slogans against the Punjab government. Teams of teachers from all over Punjab had arrived to participate in this great rally. The preparations for the Maharally were going on for the past several days.

---||Delhi||Religare case: How long will probe take, SC asks police||New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Friday asked the economic offences wing of Delhi Police to specify the time it would require to complete its probe against Shivinder Mohan Singh, erstwhile promoter of Religare Enterprises Ltd, who is accused of siphoning off Rs 2,400 crore from Religare Finvest Ltd. Appearing for Shivinder, senior advocate Sidharth Luthra persuaded a disinclined bench headed by Chief Justice N V Ramana to entertain his client's plea and issue a limited notice to the Delhi Police on the time required to complete the probe ongoing for the last two years. The economic offences wing of the Delhi Police had registered an FIR in March 2019 on receiving a complaint from RFL’s authorised representative Manpreet Suri, against Shivinder, former REL chairman and managing director Sunil Godhwani, former RFL chief executive officer Kavi Arora, and others. Suri alleged that these accused put RFL in poor financial condition by disbursing loans to entities with no financial standing and wilfully defaulted in repayments, causing loss to RFL to the tune of Rs 2,397 crore, according to the prosecution. The bench asked the Delhi Police to inform the court in two weeks about the time it would take to complete the investigations into the case. The bench appeared disinclined to grant bail to Shivinder as it said, "the allegations are serious and the investigations are going on. You will have to wait for sometime." However, when Luthra pointed out that Shivinder has been in jail for two years and that his alleged co-conspirators have been granted bail, the SC decided to seek information from Delhi Police about the time it would need to complete the probe.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/religare-case-how-long-will-probe-take-sc-asks-police/articleshow/85910418.cms||---

Police should remember that all those who come before them are not criminals and should not behave with them as if they are criminals, Justice Devan Ramachandran said. Even in the case of persons who have committed any offences, police only have the authority to take legal action, the court said, adding that the public is not liable to entertain the bad behaviour of police. Rules regarding behaviour of the police to the public should be improved and police personnel should behave decently with the public, the court said while directing the state police chief to issue a circular with these directions. The court was considering a plea by a merchant from Cherpu in Thrissur alleging that police misbehaved with him and his daughter in the name of Covid norm violation. During the hearing, the court also mentioned that there are widespread complaints of police abuses in the state in the name of enforcing Covid protocol. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/use-decent-language-with-public-cops-told/articleshow/85910389.cms||---

Due to students passing on the basis of previous year’s marks, without any examination, the cut-off in a few subjects has been 100%. This year, in Maharaja College, the cut-off in general category for Mathematics honours and Physics honours is 100% each. Cut-off in OBC category for Mathematics honours in Maharaja College is also 100%. In Maharani College, around 12 students scoring marks as high as 100% were selected in BA courses. This is the first time that such high-percentage-scoring students were admitted in the colleges. Sangeeta Gupta, principal of Maharani College said with no examination, schools were given full leverage to provide good marks, which is being reflected in the admission process. The lowest cut-off percentage in general category is 91.40% (Rajasthan College) this year. In Rajasthan College, OBC and ST cut-offs have also been higher. Selected students will have to submit their fees between September 6 and 8. In a notification issued on Wednesday, Rajasthan University administration had announced that the second cut-off list will be released on September 13, for which the fees has to be submitted between September 14 and 16 through the university and college website by 11.59pm. As per the notification, if there are more students on one seat, then on the basis of Class X marks, final admission will be done, but if students have equal percentage in Class X board as well, then on the basis of birth certificate, the student older in age will be given admission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/high-cut-offs-at-ru-this-year-amid-pandemic-criterion-in-board-exams/articleshow/85912756.cms||---
---||Agra||UP: NCDC in Firozabad to probe ‘viral’ deaths, WHO says ‘dengue haemorrhagic fever’||AGRA/NOIDA: A five-member team of the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) sent by the Union health ministry is in Firozabad to investigate deaths of children after prolonged fever, dropping platelets, severe dehydration and bleeding of gums. The Firozabad DM and UP DG (health) said dengue haemorrhagic fever could be the cause while the UP medical education principal secretary said these are cases of dengue, leptospirosis and scrub typhus. With six more cases, the death toll in Firozabad, the epicentre of the viral disease, touched 71. Of them, 52 were children, local sources said. “The WHO has suggested dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) could be causing deaths,” Firozabad DM Chandra Vijay Singh told TOI. UP DG (health) Dr Ved Vrat Singh said, “The Centre has asked the NCDC team to investigate deaths due to viral fever and dengue-like symptoms in Firozabad. The team will also study the nature of vector-borne diseases spreading there.” He added, “Local authorities have been alerted about the spread of dengue haemorrhagic fever. It is a severe form of the disease.” There were reports of ambulances charging up to Rs 20,000 in Firozabad to get patients to neighbouring districts where there might be better chances of getting beds.During a visit by UP chief secretary Rajendra Kumar Tiwari to Noida, officials said some samples had been tested. “We can say for sure that there are known causes and there is no mystery. We had sent samples to KGMU (King George’s Medical University), Lucknow that have confirmed dengue in several cases. It was a small outbreak of dengue and leptospirosis,” Alok Kumar, principal secretary of UP medical education, told TOI. Officials said 185 samples had been tested by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR), of which 73 were positive for dengue, 47 for leptospirosis, 28 for scrub typhus and one for Japanese encephalitis. At a meeting in Lucknow, CM Yogi Adityanath had asked Kumar to position himself in Firozabad and monitor the situation. Senior IAS officer Sudhir M Bobde has been appointed nodal officer for Firozabad district. Sources in Firozabad told TOI that an estimated 5,000 people in the district are bedridden with fever, at home and in hospitals. With increasing cases, the situation is fast turning Covid-like. Health officials said 400 patients were being treated at the Government Medical College, Firozabad, on Friday, two-thirds of whom were children. An additional facility with 100 beds will be set up by Saturday morning. “Beds have been increased at Mathura medical college. Surveillance and anti-larvae activity has been stepped up,” said Kumar. “Twelve doctors from other districts have been sent to Firozabad to manage the crisis … We have also arranged for additional blood donation camps and platelet units from Agra, Kanpur and Lucknow are being brought in. I will be camping in Firozabad for two days.” Additional director (health) AK Singh, too, said, there are enough reserves. “There is no shortage of platelets and medicines at government centres. I will look into the availability of hearses,” he added. A video of a man carrying his dead daughter on a bike outside the Firozabad medical college had gone viral. “She died without proper treatment on Thursday evening. I requested a hearse but there was none,” the man, Ramkumar, said. There were reports of ambulances charging up to Rs 20,000 in Firozabad to get patients to neighbouring districts where there might be better chances of getting beds. One such person, Vimal Gautam, said, “I admitted my 5-year-old daughter to a private hospital after she had high fever. Her platelet count started falling on Friday morning. Doctors asked me to arrange for three units but I could not. I took her to the medical college but there were no beds. I am trying to get her to Agra but private ambulances are overcharging. I will try a taxi.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/ncdc-in-firozabad-to-probe-viral-deaths-who-says-dengue-haemorrhagic-fever/articleshow/85910441.cms||Deepak Lavania

A division bench of Chief Justice S Manikumar sought a report on the steps taken after considering a PIL by Vettampara Pourasamithy through advocate PB Sahasranaman. During the admission hearing, the court said it is a serious matter and that the government should inform the court about the action taken. It was alleged that lack of boundary fencing and trenches, coupled with the failure of electric fencing, around Malayattoor forest area is adversely affecting the life of the people residing in areas surrounding the forest. Several elephants have entered human settlement areas and destroyed crops, the petition said while alleging that best practices to protect the life and property of citizens from elephant attacks are not being followed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-takes-up-pil-on-elephant-attacks/articleshow/85910475.cms||---

---||Delhi||At 99.5%, getting into economics (H) at Delhi's St Stephen’s College tougher than last year||NEW DELHI: St Stephen’s College, which conducts is own admissions outside of Delhi University’s process, has announced a cut-off point of 99.5% for economics (H) for commerce and humanities students. This is an increase both from the 98.75% for humanities students last year and 99.25% for science students. For the honours courses in history and English and BA Programme, the qualifying mark is the same as last year at 99%. For science subjects, the bar is static from last year or marginally lower. Being a religious minority college, St Stephen’s conducts its own admission process and releases separate cutoffs for different streams. It provides relaxation of up to 25% of the stipulated benchmark for Christian students who are members of the Church of North India and belong to the Delhi diocese. These cutoffs make the students eligible to appear for an interview. The Class XII marks have a weightage of 85% and the interview 15% for eventual admission. Because of the pandemic, the interviews will be held online but the schedule hasn’t been released. For science students, the eligibility for economics (H) has remained the same as last year at 98.75%. Additionally, only those scoring 95% and above in mathematics are eligible and have to include these marks in calculating the best-of-four aggregate. For English (H), at 99% the cutoff for commerce students is the same as last year, while for humanities students it has dipped to 98.7% this year from 98.75% last year. However, for science students, the required mark has gone up to 99% from 98.75%. For all of them, the basic requirement is 90% in English core and 85% in elective. In the case of history (H), the cutoff is 99% for science and commerce students, 98.25% for humanities. For BA Programme, science and commerce students require 99% to be eligible for the interview, though for humanities students, the bar, at 97.75%, is lower than last year’s 98%. Sanskrit (H) has the lowest cutoff and requires students from all streams to have scored 69% in Class XII. In the BSc courses, only mathematics (H) has an increased qualifying mark, with science and commerce students requiring 98.5%, half a percent more than last year and humanities students facing a stiffer 98% from 96.5% in 2020. The benchmark for BSc Programmes has dropped though. For the chemistry combination, the cutoff this year is 95.33%, down from 96.33% last year. For the computer science combination, the bar has dropped to 97% from 97.67% in 2020. Even for chemistry, the benchmark this year is 96.33%, which is lower than last year’s 96.67%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/at-99-5-getting-into-eco-h-at-stephens-tougher-than-last-yr/articleshow/85910741.cms||Shradha Chettri

The roads have been closed due to landslides in the Darma, Chaudas and Vyas valleys of Dharchula, which adjoin the border with Nepal and China. Though villagers get ration as per government norms, that is not proving sufficient. “Due to road blocks, we are facing difficulties in going to the market to purchase daily essentials like oil, salt, pulses, toothpaste etc,” said a villager, adding that if the roads are not opened up, the administration should try to send these items through choppers. The three valleys of Dharchula have 40 villages. Since June 20, rain and landslides have blocked the roads in Darma valleys. In July, roads of Chaudas and Vyas were also blocked. "The supply department has four ration godowns in Dugtu, Pangu, Sirdang and Gunji. And ration is being distributed to villagers," said MP Singh, district supply officer, Pithoragarh. Ration is also available in godowns for the next few months, he added. "Villagers got ration from public distribution system. It was wheat and rice. People need other essential items as well," said Salu Datal, a resident of Dantu village. There are small shops in villages and all goods have been used, he added. "Sobla road has remained blocked since June. Villagers are unable to reach the Dharchula market. So, we request the authorities to provide chopper service," said Mamta Devi, a resident of Nagling. "The district administration did not receive any such complaints from these valleys. We'll take action if we get any," said Ram Chauhan, ADM, Pithoragarh. TOI had reported a day earlier on gas cylinders being bought in the area for prices ranging from Rs 2,500 to Rs 3,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/with-access-to-roads-cut-off-a-fight-for-essentials-at-villages-along-china-border/articleshow/85908009.cms||Prem Punetha

Cops got a clue about his whereabouts from a petrol pump on Kamptee Road where he had swiped a credit card to pay for the fuel.During interrogation, Tembhre told cops that it was easy for him to steal bikes that were parked with keys left plugged in by careless bikers. He would then speed away with the bikes to Seoni district.After mortgaging some bikes and disposing of others for an amount ranging between Rs5,000 and Rs15,000, Tembhre would splurge the money at gambling dens and on feasting. He had been disowned by parents for indulging in anti-social activities, said cops.Tembhre had been caught by city police in the past too. He was in jail for a substantial period before walking out free around six months ago.

Talking to TOI, Hari Om Sharma, engineer-in-chief, Uttarakhand PWD, said, “The teams have already started the soil testing work before the reconstruction of the Jakhan river bridge. The construction of a four-way bridge is in pipeline under a central government project, which will be carried out by the National Highways Authority of India as soon as the sanctions are received. Meanwhile, we have been tasked with reconstructing a two-lane bridge and streamlining the commuting as before.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/reconstruct-fallen-bridge-as-4-lane-not-2-lane/articleshow/85908023.cms||Abhijeet Singh

---||Ahmedabad||Exports of dyes rise 33%, chemicals up 38% in July||Ahmedabad: The export of dyes from the country rose 33% to $247 million (approximately Rs1,803 crore) in July 2021 from $185 million (about Rs 1,350 crore) in the same month last year, shows data compiled by Basic Chemicals, Cosmetics & Dyes Export Promotion Council (Chemexcil). The surge in dye exports is largely attributed to the low base of July 2020 when the exports were hit due to Covid-19 induced disruptions, said industry players in Gujarat, which accounts for almost 70-75% of the total dyes and dye intermediates exported from India. Overall, monthly chemical exports from the country grew by 38% in July at $2,008 million (Rs 14,658 crore approx) from $1,451 million (Rs 10,592 crore approx) in last July. Gujarat’s share in India’s chemicals exports is about 60%. “The growth in exports is mainly on account of low base in July last year,” Bhupendra Patel, chairman, Gujarat region, Chemexcil. However, the exports have showed downward trend on month-on-month basis. The exports of dyes in July showed a drop of 2% over $251 million (about Rs 1,831 crore) compared to June. Similarly, the exports of all chemicals also declined 11% from $2,220 million (Rs 16,206 crore) worth chemicals exported in June 2021, according to Chemexcil. “Covid-19 related restrictions imposed in July across importing countries such as Indonesia, Taiwan, Bangladesh and European nations may have impacted the exports of chemicals on month-on-month basis,” Patel said. “Container shortage, high freight and non-availability of vessels also took its toll on exports. These factors have continued to affect exports in August as well,” Patel added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/exports-of-dyes-rise-33-chemicals-up-38-in-july/articleshow/85910494.cms||---
---||Jaipur||More RBSE students than CBSE secure seats in Rajasthan University||JAIPUR: When percentile formula was removed by the state government, as expected, the number of CBSE students admitted increased in Rajasthan University as compared to RBSE students. However, this year, due to the high marks given in RBSE, only 30% CBSE students were able to secure seats in Rajasthan University constituent colleges. This year, students were passed without any examination, on the basis of previous class’s percentage. According to experts, RBSE students scored better percentage as compared to CBSE. Hence, they were able to get more seats. Sangeeta Gupta, principal, Maharani College said, “In our college, RBSE students got 70% of the seats, despite the percentage-basis admissions. Last year, when percentile formula was removed, CBSE students were in high numbers. It can be seen, that RBSE students got higher percentage as compared to those from CBSE.” In Maharani College, around 12 students scoring marks as high as 100% were selected in BA courses, out of whom, nine are from the RBSE. Vice-principal of Maharaja College, Rishikesh Meena said that only a handful of CBSE students got admission this year in Maharaja College. In BCA, 115 RBSE students and only five from CBSE got admission in Maharaja College. In BSc Hons, one or two students of CBSE board in different subjects were able to get admission. “This year, in Maharaja College, a few students from CBSE board were able to take admission. This is opposite of what we expected looking at last year’s trend when percentile formula was removed and CBSE students were in high numbers,” said Meena. However, in Commerce College, the selections have been almost equal and not much difference can be seen between CBSE and RBSE students in terms of admissions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/more-rbse-students-than-cbse-secure-seats-in-raj-university/articleshow/85912782.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Ganesh Mandals back NMC ban on idol immersion in lakes||Nagpur: Sarvajanik Ganesh Mandals have supported the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) diktat of blanket ban on immersion of idols in lakes. While a few mandals said that they will follow the new rule, others stated that the NMC should make alternate arrangements at abandoned quarries outside the city limits. NGOs in the city welcomed the move and said it was the right time for the NMC to channelise its efforts towards conserving lakes. Ashish Budholiya of Shree Santi Sarvajanik Ganesh Mandal in central Nagpur — one of oldest mandals in city — welcomed the move. President of Ekta Ganesh Mandal and former MLC Prakash Gajbhiye said that he will follow the NMC directive. “This year we have decided to restrict the height of the idol but we will seek permission to immerse it in Futala lake,” he said while adding that they will ask for more options of water bodies outside the city limits like Vena dam. Budholiya too said their mandal will seek permission from city police for immersion in Futala lake. “If we get the nod, we will definitely immerse idols there. But if asked, we will go for artificial tanks,” he said.Nilesh Raut of Bhende Layout Ganeshotsav Mandal termed the NMC’s decision as appropriate. “The NMC and state government had put height restrictions due to the pandemic. So the idol will be immersed in artificial ponds. However, what when there will be no restriction on the height of idols?” Raut said. He suggested the NMC to identify abandoned quarries (there are many) outside city limits which can be used every year for immersion of idols.However, it is imperative for the NMC to make alternative arrangements, said convenor of the mandals. While the decision to promote eco-friendly immersion is highly appropriate, there is a need to ensure that the idols are not defaced, they said.Founder of Green Vigil Foundation Kaustav Chatterjee said that banning idol immersion in all lakes is a strong step towards lake conservation. “On the one hand, the government as well as NMC is spending so much to rejuvenate our lakes and on the other hand citizens pollute lakes by immersing idols and dumping garbage,” he said. He demanded that immersion of idols be completely banned not only during Ganpati immersion but also other festivals like Janmashtami, Durga-Gauri visarjan, teej etc. “However, NMC needs to erect a large number of robust artificial tanks for Ganpati visarjan, including specified huge artificial tanks for community idol immersion,” he said. “Lake conservation needs to be a yearlong programme. Constituting committee comprising local residents and shopkeepers for ensuring conservation of nearby lakes could be a good idea. Citizens and all stakeholders need to come forward to conserve the lakes of city,” said Chatterjee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ganesh-mandals-back-nmc-ban-on-idol-immersion-in-lakes/articleshow/85908029.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Nagpur||Nothing concrete about the newly laid Gokulpeth Canal Rd||Nagpur: Concretization of the Gokulpeth Canal Road (Ram Nagar Road-WHC Road patch) had provided relief to residents and motorists from a bumpy ride. However, the relief was short lived as the newly laid cement stretch failed to withstand the onslaught of the heavy rains on Thursday. The surface of the road has started wearing off with water accumulating in the by-lanes. Gravel can also be seen on the entire stretch due to the damaged surface layer.In 2019, the NMC had awarded the tender of converting the 730-metre patch tar road into cement concrete to M/s Sweety Constructions. The cost of the project was Rs 90 lakh. “We thought it would end the troubles of the potholes-ridden road. Due to the poor quality of construction, our dream of having smooth roads was shattered,” was the general opinion of residents.“The surface layer of the cement concrete has come off at several places on this small stretch where the roads have become uneven and even potholes can be clearly visible. If not attended immediately, it will soon take the shape of a crater,” said Gokulpeth resident Satish Barbate.TOI has been highlighting construction of sub-standard cement roads across the city which lead to cracks in most of the newly-concretized stretches, including the busy inner Ring Road, VIP Road, West High Court Road, KDK College Road among others.After being informed by locals, TOI visited the spot and found shoddy job done by the contractor. Even the T-points at these internal roads are in a bad state with no ramps, admitted an official from Dharampeth zone’s public works department. The contractor left the ramp abruptly which may cause two-wheelers to skid, pointed out Abhijeet Dande, a local resident.The official said that the civic body has stalled the payment of the contractor for the poor work. “The contractor will have to rectify all the shortcomings,” the official assured.“The contractor has failed to maintain the height of the road with other connecting roads in the vicinity. Compared to the existing roads, including West High Court Road, the height of this road is much higher leading to accumulation of rainwater. Even the mouths of stormwater drains were constructed on the upper side, leaving it useless,” pointed out another resident Sujal Dubey.TOI also spotted holes allegedly made by the contractor in the retaining wall of the Dharampeth canal at several places. Though this may help to drain out the rain water, in the long run this damage may lead to the collapse of the retaining wall, fear residents. According to residents, numerous complaints to the NMC’s public works department have gone unheard. NMC engineers did not inspect the road after complaints. It is the responsibility of the engineers to remain present when this road was being concretized but that too was not followed it seems, sources said.THE SHORTCOMINGS* Concrete starts flaking off* Ramps with other roads not maintained* Stormwater chambers not laid properly* Uneven construction* Chambers not covered properly* Holes in retaining walls to drain out water||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nothing-concrete-about-the-newly-laid-gokulpeth-canal-rd/articleshow/85908074.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

This, even though people can park their vehicles for free along a 10.5km stretch close to this structure. The irony plays out across the city as Rs 474 crore of taxpayers’ money will be pumped over next two years into multi-level car parks when the existing ones can claim barely 32% to 35% occupancy. What’s more, of the 51 lakh motorized trips in Ahmedabad city, car trips constitute just 5%! Nearly 77% of Amdavadi motorized trips are on two-wheelers, 12% in public transport, and remaining 6% on shared and regular rickshaws, states a study commissioned by AMC itself. This could be one of the reasons why mechanized hydraulic car parks at Kankaria and Navrangpura have already turned into white elephants with operational efficiency between 32% and 35% occupancy. In May 2019, the then municipal commissioner Vijay Nehra had admitted that the location of Navrangpura multi-level facility was “faulty”. “The AMC’s policy of operating paid parking facilities near these multi-crore multi-level parking complexes has been strangulating the projects. CG Road, which is near the Navrangpura multi-level park, offers parking space all along the road. Meanwhile, AMC has paid parking lots close to the six gates of Kankaria lakefront which hits the occupancy of the multi-level car park there,” says a senior official in the estate department. The official added that prior to building overbridges in the city, detailed studies are carried out to check for the need to build one. “Similar surveys for parking demand and public habits of parking were never carried out before investing crores of taxpayers’ money,” the official added. With such low occupancies, even private operators refuse to participate as AMC keeps escalating licence fees. “The AMC has not bothered to revise parking fee structure for over one and a half decades but is prompt in increasing licence fee,” claimed the operator of one such a multi-level parking complex.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/multi-level-parking-complexes-empty-yet-more-planned/articleshow/85910565.cms||---

The court had in January issued the order on the petition filed by Surendran in 2004 against the government and the seven policemen. The government filed the appeal at Kalpetta sessions court stating that Surendran had a role in the conspiracy behind Muthanga agitation and the order directing payment of compensation was incorrect. Surendran was an accused in the case filed by the police in connection with the death of a policeman during Muthanga agitation and accused of criminal conspiracy. Police had portrayed him as a mastermind of the agitation staged by tribesmen after occupying forest land at Muthanga as part of the land agitation. But CBI, which took over the case later, did not include him as an accused. Surendran then filed a complaint against illegal detention and custodial torture against the police and revenue officials.tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/govt-appeals-against-payout-to-kk-surendran/articleshow/85910602.cms||---

The UGD chambers were established at least three decades ago. New layers of bituminous road laid on the stretch over the years have buried most of the chambers underneath the road. With heavy vehicles and mofussil buses heading to Karur and Coimbatore accessing the stretch regularly, the steel manholes have deformed at multiple spots. “The manholes are protruding over the surface of the road at multiple spots. People end up taking sudden turns upon noticing the manholes with buses and heavy vehicles trailing them,” K Sathish Kumar, a frequent commuter said. President of the district road users’ welfare organisation president P Aiyarappan said that the civic body had assured to launch the maintenance work after the lockdown, but no efforts were taken so far. “Acting on complaints, we filled the gap between manholes and road. The local body has informed us that the existing UGD network is getting revamped,” a senior official with the state highways department said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichys-protruding-manholes-spell-danger-for-motorists/articleshow/85910527.cms||Deepak Karthik

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Nearly 20 lakh hectares of Kharif crops hit by flood and drought||JAIPUR: It is a bad Kharif season for farmers in the state. First it was the flood, then the drought that had taken a heavy toll on the Kharif season. owing to this, altogether, nearly 20 lakh hectares of Kharif crops have been lost, according to initial estimates. The government-ordered ‘girdawari’ is still on and the full extent of damage to the crops due to the vagaries of nature could be known only once the ‘girdawari’ is complete. Due to the failure of the monsoon, nine districts have come under the grip of drought-like situation. According to initial estimates, about 14.76 lakh hectares of crops have been destroyed due to drought alone. Crop loss due to heavy rain and flood in July was estimated to be nearly 4.84 lakh hectares. Thus the total crops perished in the current sowing season owing to flood is nearly 20 lakh hectares. The total sowing of crops during this season was 47.24 lakh hectares. The western Rajasthan is the worst affected by the scanty rainfall during this monsoon season. Bajra and Guar are the major crops affected in these districts. Agriculture minister Lalchand Kataria has directed the officials to provide mid-season adversity assistance under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana after conducting a survey of the damage caused to crops due to scanty rainfall. He directed the officials to invoke provision 21.4 of the scheme if the main crop is expected to yield less than 50 per cent as compared to the average yield of the last seven years. Under this provision, the district collector had to convene a meeting of the District Level Monitoring Committee (DLMC) to constitute a joint panel to conduct a survey in the areas where there is a possibility of reduction in production by more than 50 per cent. He said that during the survey, geo-tagging of photos and videos with date and time will be done. Also, the signature of the representative of the insurance company and the of farmer will be taken on the survey report. The joint committee includes the personnel of the revenue and agriculture department, representatives of the insurance company and farmers. Under this provision, immediate assistance is provided to the farmers. The balance insurance claim is adjusted on the basis of the average yield obtained after harvesting, he said. At present a joint survey is being done in Barmer, Bikaner, Churu, Jaisalmer, Jodhpur, Jalore, Pali, Sirohi and Ganganagar districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/nearly-20l-hectares-of-kharif-crops-hit-by-flood-and-drought/articleshow/85912853.cms||Joychen Joseph

The court was hearing the bail plea of - M Raja, a resident of Sivaganga district and S Selvi of Madurai, who were arrested by the Tallakulam police on July 1. They have been arrayed as fourth and fifth accused in the case. The case of the prosecution is that a woman who was unable to maintain her three children handed them over to an orphanage run by the NGO in March. On June 21, director of the trust, G R Shivakumar, his associate Mathershaw and trust coordinator Kalaivani made the woman believe that her younger son died of Covid-19. Subsequently they sold the child to a couple. Similarly, they also sold a girl child to another couple. Justice B Pugalendhi took note of the fact that Raja was a vegetable vendor who was supplying vegetables to the trust and Selvi, a social worker. Believing the genuineness of the trust, they had merely recommended two couples who were looking to adopt a child. However, making use of the situation, Shivakumar, Mathershaw and Kalaivani had committed the offence. Observing that there were no incriminating materials against them, the judge granted bail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/bail-for-2-in-case-of-child-trafficking-adoption/articleshow/85910583.cms||---

The gathering of farmers protesting against the three new farm laws will mark the beginning of “campaign mode”, farm leaders said, for the UP and Uttarakhand elections. Coming days after at least 10 farmers were allegedly injured in a police lathicharge during protests at Karnal in Haryana on August 28, the mahapanchayat has gained an urgency and momentum of its own. A video of the SDM purportedly asking cops to “break the heads” of protesters had then gone viral, after which the Haryana deputy CM had sought action against him. “Farmers from across the country, including Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and the southern states, will be arriving. Thousands of farmers from across UP started moving towards Muzaffarnagar on Friday. We have planned arrangements for 5 lakh,” said Yudhvir Singh, national general secretary of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU). “But the number might exceed that. And a lot of women will join.” Police had a more conservative estimate. “We expect a 70,000-strong gathering. To manage such crowds, deployment of forces is a standard operating procedure,” Muzaffarnagar SSP Abhishek Yadav said. The forces include six companies of Provincial Armed Constabulary and two of Rapid Action Force, and 1,200 policemen. “Drone cameras will be used for aerial surveillance and 200 CCTV cameras have been installed,” the SSP added. For the Muzaffarnagar mahapanchayat, 2,500 volunteers will work to keep things running and “ensure peace”. “SKM will officially declare its 'Mission UP and Uttarakhand' at the mahapanchayat on Sunday. We will appeal to farmers and other voters to defeat BJP in the elections. The event is also an attempt to unite farmers across castes and religions, and show our strength. The farmers’ protest will intensify,” SKM leader Gurnam Singh Charuni said. Preparations are afoot on a grand scale. Over 20 LED screens and microphones are being set up in a 4-km radius from the venue, Government Inter College Ground. From Saturday, 500 langars will start operating in Muzaffarnagar and surrounding areas. Another 500 mobile langars, tractors carrying food and drinking water, will ply routes leading up to Muzaffarnagar. Those coming in for the mahapanchayat from outside Muzaffarnagar can put up at one of over 20 banquet halls booked by the farmers’ body. Also in place will be 100 medical camps, 50 ambulances and a temporary hospital to address any medical emergency.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/farmers-gather-forces-for-largest-mahapanchayat-on-sep-5/articleshow/85908126.cms||Deepak Lavania

The convener of the priests collective Father John Kavalakkatt and joint convener Fr Jose Palatti said they will give a petition seeking to review the decision of the recent synod of the Syro Malabar Church insisting that the priests must conduct the holy mass in all the churches facing the altar, to the higher authorities in the church. They said they will be submitting the petition to the bishop of Irinjalakuda diocese as well as to Pope Francis and to the Apostolic Nuncio in India, whose office is in New Delhi. The dissenting priests are demanding the present practice of celebrating the holy mass facing the faithful must be continued in the churches under SMC. Some other priests in Thrissur archdiocese are also unlikely to read pastoral letter in the churches on Sunday.

---||Madurai||Bail denied to two caught with sea cucumber worth Rs 2 crore||Madurai: Dismissing the bail plea of a man who was arrested for illegal possession of 2,800kg of sea cucumbers worth about Rs 2 crore in Ramanathapuram district, the Madras high court has observed that over-exploitation of sea cucumbers not only affects the marine ecosystem, but also the human ecosystem, more particularly the fishermen, as both are interdependent. The court made the observations while hearing the bail plea of Villayutham, who was arrested by the Jetty police in Ramanathapuram district. The court had dismissed his bail plea by taking into account that there were 13 previous cases of similar nature against him. Pursuant to an earlier direction, G Venkatesh, forest range officer of Mandapam wildlife range had submitted a report before the court. Justice B Pugalendhi observed observed that over-exploitation of sea cucumbers would decrease sediment health, reduce nutrient recycling and potential benefits of deposit feeding to sea water chemistry, diminish biodiversity of associated symbionts and reduce the transfer of organic matter from detritus to higher trophic levels. To avoid such a situation, sea cucumbers are listed in Schedule I, Part IV-C of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 and are strictly banned for collection and for trade in India, from 2001. The judge observed that a blanket submission was made that the sea cucumbers are caught in the net while fishing and that they are not caught intentionally. This court is not inclined to accede to the said submission for the reason that sea cucumbers are found on the sea floor and not on the surface of the sea or the inter-space. The judge observed that in the present case, though the FIR was registered in June, no steps were taken to transfer the files to the forest officials. Such conduct on the part of the police needs to be deprecated, as it would give room for the offenders to come out on statutory bail for non-filing of chargesheet. Hence, the judge directed the Ramanathapuram superintendent of police to look into this matter and take action against the concerned erring officials. The judge also directed the SP to issue necessary directions to the officials to avoid the recurrence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/bail-denied-to-two-caught-with-sea-cucumber-worth-rs-2-crore/articleshow/85910616.cms||Kaushik Kannan

Health officials from the corporation would inspect them periodically and action would be taken against those without proper compliance. Corporation commissioner K P Karthikeyan, said that all organisations and industries should utilise the free vaccination camps being conducted in the 31 urban primary health centres (UPHC) in the city and also the 24x7 vaccination facility of the Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH), to ensure that all their workers get their jabs on time. Welcoming the directive, president of the Tamil Nadu Foodgrains Merchants Association, S P Jeyaprakagasam, said that they will follow it strictly, as it was proved that 100% vaccination was the only way in which normalcy can return. “We have already covered more than 2,000 people through two camps for our members and plan to conduct two more soon,” he said. Jeyapragasam said that they were motivating their workers to take up the vaccination and even warning them that a day may come when the unvaccinated could lose their jobs. “Full vaccination is a must and that is what we are trying to promote among our workers, but it would be better if the government also came up with awareness programmes similar to what is done for AIDS prevention in the local language to reach out to the rural people faster,” said vice-president Madurai District Tiny and Smallscale Industries Association, A K B Nawas Babu. Folk artistes could be used for these awareness sessions in places like the industrial estates in Kappalur, Urangapatti and places like Jaihinpuram and Sellur, he said. Babu also appealed to the corporation not to impose heavy fines on the workers, but instead issue warnings. Meanwhile, hotels in the city have told their staff that they would get their salaries on September 7 only if they have their vaccination certificates. President of the Madurai Hotel Owners Association, K L Kumar, said that there were about 500 hotels in the association, with about one lakh workers of which 50% are vaccinated. “Some of them say that they don’t have Aadhaar cards due to which they are not able to take the vaccines. Hence, it would be good if the district administration organises Aadhaar enrollment camps to speed up the vaccination process,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/shops-with-unvaccinated-staff-will-face-action-madurai-corpn/articleshow/85910677.cms||---

Some unhappy workers, though, called the district police administration's transfer decision a "promotion", while cops said that "investigation was still on". Later in the day, the district police cancelled the transfer order. Earlier, on Wednesday, police in Manglaur had picked up a man, Amit Saini for questioning in a case of financial fraud. Some local party workers reached the police station to get Saini out. When inspector Yashpal Singh Bisht refused, angry party workers sat on a dharna in front of the main gate, alleging Bisht had misbehaved with them. Later, the protest turned ugly when Bisht purportedly lost his temper after he was accused of "accepting bribe in a previous case". Jhabreda MLA Deshraj Karanwal was also present on the occasion. "We demanded his [Bisht's] immediate transfer from Manglaur and a probe for misbehaving with our party workers and officials. Both our demands have been taken up. So, we are satisfied," Karanwal told TOI. No one was booked and all were allowed to go, sources said. Now, Bisht has been attached to the police range office at Dehradun, confirmed Haridwar SSP Senthil Avoodai Krishna Raj S. Meanwhile, incumbent Kotwali Roorkee in-charge inspector Amar Chand Sharma was sent to Manglaur in place of Bisht. However, this order too was rolled back.

They approached the district collector’s office on Friday demanding his intervention to ensure peaceful coexistence without caste-based discrimination. The petitioners — B Seethalakshmi, R Kaviya, K Anjalidevi and P Menaka — hailing from T Eechampatti village in Thirupainjilee panchayat, said they belong to the scheduled caste community while their husbands are from the most backward class (MBC) mutharaiyar community.  Although they were married years ago, the petitioners said a section of influential villagers including those holding posts in temple management and local bodies have been discriminating against them. “We are not allowed to attend local temple festivals. They will not accept even our contribution,” B Seethalakshmi said. Her husband S Baskaran told TOI that these influential men from the mutharaiyar community are preventing even government schemes from reaching them for marrying a woman outside his caste. The petitioners named panchayat president P Tyagarajan, local temple functionary Kozhipannai Mani and eight others as frequent harassers. “It is only during a temple festival that those who have married within our caste (mutharaiyar) are given priority to initiate rituals such as breaking a coconut. They (inter-caste couple) can do it later. It is practised in our village for centuries,” Kozhipannai Mani, tax collector, Eechampatti Mariamman koil, said. He denied allegations of ostracization threats against the inter-caste couples.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/inter-caste-couples-allege-ostracization-bid-in-trichy-village/articleshow/85910665.cms||---

The villagers hail from Kailasapuram, Savarimangalam, Jambulingapuram, S.Pudhur and Varadharajapuram. They said that a private company has planned to construct a cement factory in S.Kailaasapuram and that they are opposing it as it would pose a serious pollution threat to their villages. They feared that it would cause illnesses such as breathing difficulty among the villagers. They said that they had already recorded their protest to the cement factory in the public hearing on August 12. The protesting villagers expressed concern that their views went unheard as they alleged that those in support of the factory were brought from other places to support the company, citing possible employment generation.

Thakkar was alone at Rajput’s house when the ornaments were stolen. Ramol police had on Wednesday registered a case against unidentified persons for the theft of 14 gold items from the residence of Rajput, situated at Galaxy Coral in Vastral. The complainant had stated that the unidentified person or persons had entered his house on the first floor and had taken away the ornaments from a safe. Rajput had stated in the complaint that he had invited his friends, Alpesh Parmar and Thakkar, on August 30 as he was alone. The complainant stated that he had gone out for snacks with Parmar in the evening. Later, when his wife returned she found a gold pendant lying on the floor and brought it to Rajput’s notice. He then filed a police complaint. The cops said that since Thakkar was alone at the house, he was considered the prime suspect. Eventually, police recovered the gold ornaments from Thakkar.

---||Kolkata||Most Kolkatans ignore early signs of nerve diseases: Survey||KOLKATA: Early signs of a nerve disease are ignored by a majority in Kolkata leading to a worsening of the ailment and poor treatment outcomes, according to a survey conducted among 1,800 respondents across 12 cities, including Kolkata. It reveals that over 60% of respondents in the city have ignored early signs of poor nerve health. Conducted by HEAL Health and Hansa Research and supported by Procter & Gamble Health Limited, the national survey also highlights that while over 90% of the respondents believe that healthy nerves are important, only 38% know that nerves are different from blood vessels. Nerve diseases centre around the brain and the spine and can affect limb movement, balance, speech and in worse cases lead to a brain stroke, said experts. The initial signs of a brain stroke are most commonly ignored or not recognized in Kolkata, according to Institute of Neurosciences Kolkata (INK) head of neurology Hrishikesh Kumar. “The most fatal of nerve ailments is a brain stroke which often have muted initial symptoms. Often, there is a tingling sensation or numbness in the limbs which progressively worsens. Quite often, it happens very fast but patients tend to wait for family physicians or family members to arrive which could be too late,” said Kumar. Nerve health depends on Vitamin B12 from the group of Vitamin B, according to Arabinda Mukherjee, former president of Indian Academy of Neurology. “But there is a lack of information about the usefulness of Vitamin B12 and how its improper intake in the diet could create lots of health problems. The deficiency of Vitamin B12 can increase the risk of mental disorders and nerve problems. Therefore, people need to understand that they must include Vitamin B12 in their dietary regimen,” said Mukherjee. The P&G Nerve Health Survey was conducted towards gauging the awareness levels and perceptions about nerve health and to understand if people can identify nerve related discomforts. Results revealed limited knowledge amongst the masses about nerve health. While people had experienced symptoms related to nerve damage only 50% related it to nerve health. A mild tremor, a sudden loss of physical balance or numbness of limbs should not be taken lightly, warned Kumar. “A persistent mild headache could be the initial sign of a brain tumour. Again, a numb limb could eventually lead to peripheral neuropathy — a disease which hinders the carrying of messages to and from the brain and the spinal cord to the rest of the body. But most patients report for treatment when a substantial damage has been done that can’t be reversed,” added Kumar. “A large population of the country today suffers from Vitamin B deficiencies without knowing the causes and the risks associated with this condition including nerve damage,” said Milind Thatte, managing director - Procter & Gamble Health Limited.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/most-kolkatans-ignore-early-signs-of-nerve-diseases-survey/articleshow/85910717.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

He reviewed the inspection and certification of school buses on Friday. As high schools and higher secondary schools had reopened, he said school buses were also expected to increase on roads. The district had about 900 to 1,000 of them, but since only classes from ninth standard had reopened, there were about 250 buses. A committee was inspecting the safety aspects and if there were drawbacks, notices were issued and buses would be allowed to run only after there is full compliance, he said. The buses had to be operated following all SOPs, including non-crowding. There was 100% vaccination of teachers. Students would be allowed to attend classes in colleges even after taking a single dose of vaccine. Meanwhile, many parents have been going for autorickshaws to transport children instead of buses as a precaution. Kavitha, mother of a class XII student, said she was still not confident of allowing her son to travel. K Abdul, an auto driver from Anna Nagar, said parents were willing to pay more for transporting just three children at a time. ``We see this as a good sign for the revival of our livelihood,’’ he said.

---||Delhi||History at the end of tunnel: Soon, walk through British-era gallows in Delhi||NEW DELHI: You could soon get to walk in a tunnel going from the current Delhi assembly building towards Red Fort or see the British-installed gallows room there. The assembly plans to make these into tourist attractions. The tunnel is reported to have been used by the British in colonial times to bring prisoners, mostly nationalist revolutionaries, to the building, which then served as a court. The gallows room was the site where prisoners were hanged to death. The tunnel has three approaches, one towards the gallows, another towards the Speaker’s chair where a witness box was once located, and the third in the direction of Red Fort. The portion of the tunnel going towards the witness box is still intact. It is around 15-feet long, six feet high and four feet wide. The floor is unpaved and the walls are made of bricks. The roof appears to be made with wood and stones. The mouth of the tunnel opens in the assembly hall and is covered with a toughened glass panel. No further digging is possible because the tunnel is now blocked, possibly by the Delhi Metro alignment and sewerage. The gallows area is located above an office chamber and is accessible by iron stairs. Some revolutionaries are believed to have been executed there. It has remained shut after Independence. Speaker Ram Niwas Goel said the tunnel and the renovated gallows room will be thrown open for the public before August 15 next year. “The visitors will be allowed in only when the assembly is not in session,” he said. The tunnel will neither be renovated nor further digging take place. “We will allow the public to see it as it is, but no visitor will be permitted to go into the tunnel, only see it at its mouth,” added Goel. The Speaker said that the process of getting the historical sites ready for public viewing had started. “Tenders have been floated and PWD will soon begin the required work,” he said. The historical significance of the tunnel is yet to be established but it is believed it connected the court with Red Fort and was used to bring prisoners without exposing them to public view. An Archaeological Survey of India official, however, said no such tunnel had been discovered at Red Fort. The building, which currently houses the Delhi legislative assembly, was built in 1911 as the Central Legislative Assembly after the shift of the colonial capital from Kolkata to Delhi. The legislature moved to the current Parliament House in 1926 and the older building became a court. The assembly is also preparing to offer other tourist attractions, like showcasing the history of the freedom struggle digitally.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/history-at-the-end-of-tunnel-soon-walk-through-british-era-gallows/articleshow/85910749.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Kochi||DBT, no common IFSC for Kerala Bank cause delay||Thrissur: A combination of two factors, the Centre’s decision to disburse crop insurance claims under direct benefit transfer (DBT) mode and delay in Kerala Bank getting its own IFSC code, are delaying the delivery of insurance claims of about 20,000 farmers across the state. About Rs 21 crore to be disbursed to farmers as insurance claims for 2019-20 was returned by the insurance company as the farmers were unable to submit their account numbers and matching IFSC codes. Claims of Rs 70 crore are pending for 2020-21. The farmers were getting compensation for crop loss due to adverse weather or other factors under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna (PMFBY). Most farmers (60-80%) have their accounts in primary agriculture cooperative societies (PACS). Earlier, the farmers were made to open mirror accounts in district cooperative banks (DCBs), and agriculture insurance company (AIC) of India was allocating the lumpsum amount of the total claims from a district to the DCB there. The DCB would then transfer the claim amount to the farmers through the mirror accounts. The DCBs were then giving utilisation certificates to AIC . However, with Centre’s decision to enforce DBT, indirect transfer of insurance claim amounts became impossible. While trying to upload the claims in the DBT portal, the farmers submitted their account number in PACS and the district cooperative bank’s IFSC code. However, their claims bounced as these two data did not match. The compensation to farmers has not been disbursed for the last two years, said K K Kochumuhammed, president of Kole Karshaka Sangam. Besides, Kerala Bank, formed by merging 13 DCBs, was yet to get a common IFSC code. “Once our software integration is over we will get a common IFSC code. We have requested AIC to retain the earlier practice till then, and clear the pending claims,” said Anita Abraham, DGM, Kerala Bank. “We had a video conference on Thursday with Union agriculture ministry officials, and requested them to defer DBT implementation till the amalgamation process of DBCs and Kerala Bank are completed, and they have responded positively,” said George Alexander, additional director of agricultural department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/dbt-no-common-ifsc-for-kerala-bank-cause-delay/articleshow/85910780.cms||T Ramavarman

---||Madurai||Study finds significant dip in rainfall in Madurai over 30 years||MADURAI: Madurai has shown a significant decreasing trend in annual rainfall among the districts in Tamil Nadu from 1989 to 2018, according to a report of India Meteorological Department (IMD). Titled “Observed rainfall variability and changes over Tamil Nadu,” it says Madurai and Dharmapuri saw significant decrease during the whole of southwest monsoon, whereas Madurai saw an annual decreasing trend too. Based on the IMD report published a few months ago, Madurai MP Su Venkatesan has written to chief minister M K Stalin seeking proactive measures to improve rainfall. The report, based on various parameters including rainy days and average rainfall, was prepared for the period from June to September as well as annually.  During June-September, Madurai had a maximum of 12 to 16 rainy days alongside ten other districts, but the number of dry days was 91 to 98 in some parts of the district. There were 25 to 27 dry days in June, up to 28 in July, 25 in August and 24 days in September. Annually, parts of Madurai had dry days for 284 to 293 days. As for heavy rainfall days, the decrease was significant in Madurai and nine other districts. It is worth noting that a report titled “Rainfall projection for Madurai” by Tamil Nadu State Climate Change Cell (TNSCCC) of the state environment department and Anna University released a couple of years ago had also flagged the decreasing trend. It quantifies the normal annual rainfall of the district from 1970 to 2000 as 840 mm. This varies from 806 mm in Sholavandan in the northern part to 964.1 mm in Melur in the eastern part of the district. It pointed out that the entire district experiences a declining trend in annual rainfall except at Melur, where a rising trend is noticed. It projects a 1% drop in rainfall for the district during 2010 to 2040. Elaborating on the proactive measures needed, Venkatesan said the green cover of the district should be increased to 33% and efforts should be taken to protect the existing forest areas. Waterbodies should be desilted and the origin as well as course of river Vaigai protected. The river, which falls under the purview of five district administrations, should be brought under one body. K N Rajkumar, team leader for climate change adaptation, Dhan Foundation, called for decentralised rainfall monitoring at the macro level for every five square kilometres for better analysis of the rainfall pattern. “Every decade has drought for two to three years, flooding for a similar period and normal rainfall for the rest of the years. But there is no pattern for the same,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/study-finds-significant-dip-in-rainfall-in-madurai-over-30yrs/articleshow/85910737.cms||M K Ananth

The target was to fully vaccinate all healthcare workers in Lucknow by March this year. There are about 79,000 healthcare workers in various government and private medical facilities. Of these 40% are women. TimesViewHealthcare workers have been at the forefront of the fight against Covid pandemic. They have a dual responsibility of protecting themselves and the public. For this, they need to set an example for the general public by getting themselves fully vaccinated and follow covid appropriate behaviour.The vaccination of the healthcare staff started on January 16. However, according to data available at the chief medical officer’s office, till date, 78,509 (99.3%) have received at least a vaccine shot. A further break-up shows that 62,267 (78.8%) have completed the two-dose course, while around 16,242 beneficiaries have taken a dose and are waiting for the gap period to end to take the second. CMO spokesperson Yogesh Raghuvanshi said that almost all the healthcare workers have been vaccinated and most of those still left are ineligible because of certain health issues. The delay in vaccination of healthcare workers was caused because many employees of private hospitals did not register themselves initially. Later, new recruitments and those transferred to Lucknow from other districts were added. The final count reached 79,000 in July. Experts opined that the health department should push the drive further and inoculate healthcare workers waiting for a second dose as early as possible. Former head of the Indian Institute of Medical Sciences-BHU, Prof Anil Kumar Gulati, said, “Full vaccination will provide healthcare workers protection while tackling the probable third Covid-19 wave.” However, he added, healthcare workers will have to continue to follow Covid protocols even after being fully vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/all-healthcare-staff-in-city-given-at-least-1-shot/articleshow/85912976.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Ramgarh sanctuary’s lone tiger awaits mate for past 14 months||KOTA: Red -tapism laced-procedure costing heavy to 4-year-old lone tiger — T-115 in Ramgarh Vishdhari wildlife sanctuary in Bundi after it had wandered here through age-old natural corridor from Ranthambore Tiger Reserve around 14 months ago.  Ramgarh Vishdhari that is waiting to be notified as state’s fourth and country’s 52nd tiger reserve has made it a long wait for T-115 that’s wanting to be paired with a tigress. In view of immediate pairing of the male young tiger T-115, the wildlife activists demanded populating Ramgarh by shifting of Ridhi, sister of Sidhi in Sariska Tiger Reserve. Ridhi’s relocation is reportedly proposed into Ranthambore Tiger Reserve as the two sisters are very quarrelsome and have sustained injuries several times in the past. A five-member delegation of the newly constituted Ramgarh tiger foundation submitted a memorandum to Kota’s chief conservator of forest (CCF) S R Yadav and demanded for pairing of T-115. However, the forest department ruled out any immediate shifting of the tigress to pair T-115 claiming procedure that demands gazette notification of Ramgarh Vishadhari Tiger Reserve and which would take around three to four months for completion. Only after the gazette notification, shifting of the tigress could be initiated. The Ramgarh Vishdahri sanctuary in June this year received in principle approval by NTCA’s technical committee for its notification as 52nd tiger reserve of the country and fourth in the state, CCF S R Yadav told TOI. It is natural course of movement for a tiger to stray from one place to other to avoid infighting in the group and the department cannot act in haste to pair the lone tiger in Ramgarh. Thorough procedure will have to be followed including preparation of adequate prey base for the tiger family, the CCF said. Though, since the day Ramgarh Vishdahri sanctuary was given in principle nod for notification, there have been a series of ‘thanksgivings’ and welcoming of the local political leaders as if all procedures were completed. The wildlife activists are apprehensive that the absence of partner for T-115 and delay in shifting of any tigress may force the tiger to retire to Ranthambore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ramgarh-sanctuarys-lone-tiger-awaits-mate-for-past-14-months/articleshow/85912966.cms||---

President of the movement, K Thilagar said that the tank which had gone dry in 2013, was now holding water throughout the year, but it also included sewage from the neighbouring residential areas near Meenakshipuram. The kudimaramathu works were carried out in the tank at a cost of Rs 48 lakh but only 30% was completed. It was specified that a trench to a length of 1,000m, 30m in width and one and a half meter in depth would be dug for the allotted money. Though the work was incomplete, the officials had exhausted the entire allocation claiming that the work was completed, hence action should be taken against them. If the tank had been restored properly it would have held a lot of water by now, as the district had seen fairly good rainfall in the past one year. But, now it was more sewage than water and the bunds have also not been strengthened.

Deputy CM Nitin Patel said on Friday: “Despite the probable income loss of excise duty on the sale of liquor, the state government will continue with the strict prohibition policy.” He went on to say: “Due to prohibition, Gujarat has peace, prosperity, and far better law and order situation than other states.” He added: “So despite losing thousands of crores in income from liquor sales, which other states get easily, we will continue with the prohibition policy.” He said further: “Gujarat will stick to Mahatma Gandhi’s and Sardar Patel’s values. We have made a provision for even suspending field-level police officials in whose jurisdiction major quantity of liquor is seized.” Gujarat is the only state which implements strict prohibition without giving thought to the revenue possible through the sale of liquor, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/dycm-despite-excise-loss-prohibition-to-prevail/articleshow/85910770.cms||---

These LVUPs, when realised, will facilitate risk-free crossing of the highway. According to sources, the proposed LVUPs would be constructed at Attinkuzhy, Technopark Phase III and Mukkola along the NH bypass stretch. All three spots would come under the south end ramp of the elevated highway. Sources said the government has already green signalled proposals for two of the LVUPs at Attinkuzhy and Mukkolakkal. The government has asked the officials of National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) here to submit a revised proposal to include one more underpass in the proposed project at Technopark Phase III. As per the plans, each underpass would be 5.5 meters tall. A year ago the state government had suggested NHAI officials consider the possibility of underpasses connecting service roads on either side of the elevated highway. This request was made considering the concerns raised by Technopark management and employees who said without it they would have to cover too much distance to enter Technopark campuses here on the east side of the highway. Techies who alight at Kazhakkoottam railway station on the west side of the highway would be the most affected. Sources close to the elevated highway works also said they are expecting to complete the highway and the underpasses simultaneously if the government approves the revised proposal which will be submitted in the next week. If everything goes as per plans, the works will be carried out by the same company constructing the elevated highway as an add-on project. The officials concerned believe that the underpasses will not only facilitate easy crossing of the highway, it will also reduce the risk of accidents. Since vehicles traveling along the elevated highway would be moving at great speed, the possibility of accidents would be higher if the vehicles from service roads try to cross the highway. Kazhakkoottam elevated is a key infrastructure project that is expected to solve the traffic woes at the IT corridor of Kazhakkoottam. The four lane elevated highway is 2.7 km long starting from CSI Mission Hospital in the north and ending near Technopark Phase III junction in the south. According to RDS Constructions, the company that is carrying out the construction, more than 65% of the works have been completed so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/three-underpasses-to-come-up-along-kazhakootam-elevated-highway/articleshow/85908339.cms||Rejith Balakrishnan

They included two girls in Ariyalur, another in Namakkal and two teachers handling higher secondary classes in Cuddalore. Among the two Ariyalur girls, one is a Class XII student and hosteller at Annai Lourd higher secondary school in Varadarajanpettai. As she developed mild upper respiratory infection (URI) symptoms, she gave her swab for RT-PCR test at Jayankondam GH on September 1. As the result came positive, she was moved to Jayankondam GH for further care. However, she had attended classes on Thursday. In the other case, a Class IX girl, a day scholar at Nirmala girls higher secondary school, had higher body temperature during thermal scanning at the school on Wednesday. She subsequently underwent RT-PCR test and tested positive even though she had no other symptoms. She did not attend classes on Thursday. The Class IX student who had been undergoing chemotherapy in recent years, was asymptomatic and was admitted to Ariyalur government medical college hospital. The district health department has collected more than 60 samples from the primary and secondary contacts of the two girls including family members, classmates and teachers.

---||Vadodara||Sheikh diverted Covid funds: Cops||Vadodara: The Covid-19 pandemic wreaked havoc across the state last year, however, for Salahuddin Sheikh it was an opportunity to launder the hawala money. Sheikh, who is accused in a religious conversion racket, allegedly used the global pandemic to divert the illegal funds and donations he got.  Police officials said that Sheikh fabricated expenses related to social work during the Covid pandemic. “He made documents to show expenses for buying ration kits, medical kits and other things for the poor and needy during Covid. The trusts and organizations that he was a part of have shown that the kits were distributed in various cities of the state,” a senior police official said.  A team of Vadodara cops recently visited Bhuj to investigate Sheikh’s links with certain persons there. Sheikh is accused of using hawala funds to build mosques in Kutch district headquarter town and other parts of the state. “The persons we questioned there said that Sheikh transferred them money for distributing food and other ration kits. One of them owns a provision store,” the police added.  The official said that Sheikh also started a medical centre last year to treat Covid patients. “Initial investigations reveal that even that centre was used to launder the money he got from hawala and via donations apart from the Afmi Trust,” he added. A team of cops is camping in Uttar Pradesh over the last few days to get custody of Sheikh and Umar Gautam.  “The UP police have added some sections in the FIR against the duo and hence they are interrogating the accused again. We will soon get their custody and bring them to the city. Sheikh’s interrogation will reveal his links in Bharuch and Bhuj,” the police said.  Sheikh and Umar are accused of funding conversion activities across the country. The police said that Sheikh received nearly Rs 60 crore through hawala and Rs 19 crore by donation for his trust over the last five years. Sheikh is accused of using this money to build mosques, fund conversion activities and provide for legal expenses of the accused in anti-CAA protests and Delhi riots.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/sheikh-diverted-covid-funds-cops/articleshow/85910114.cms||Tushar Tere

Transport secretary Ranjeet Sinha has set up an inquiry. An investigation revealed that only 37 buses from other states were shown as operating in the state in transport department records, whereas 1,250 buses from Uttar Pradesh alone are operational in Uttarakhand. The other states which are operating their buses in the state include Haryana, Rajasthan, Punjab and Himachal Pradesh which have around 400 buses running in Uttarakhand, but their numbers have also been under-reported. The initial probe finding has revealed that more than 1,500 buses currently ply in Uttarakhand. Officials said that as per the contract between Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh, buses from UP were allowed to travel on 216 routes with over 2,000 trips per day which would give a tax of over Rs 1 crore to Uttarakhand. However, in the absence of proper records, estimation of tax has become difficult. Meanwhile, state transport minister, Yashpal Arya, too, has expressed concern over the matter and said that he will "take it up with the chief minister".

---||Kolkata||Lalbazar plans specialized pool of cyber cops, lines up training courses||Kolkata: In order to create a dedicated pool of cyber cops, who will specialize in cyber crime detection, Lalbazar has devised specific cutting edge and advanced level training in combating cyber crimes. Cops, who are to be posted in the cyber cell of the detective department and the multiple cyber cells of each police division in the city, will undergo compulsory certification in computer hacking and forensic investigation. They will also be trained in network security and ethical hacking. Initially, a total of 45 cops will undergo this training. More than 150 other cops — mostly those at police stations and holding various awareness programmes at complexes and townships — will undergo a less intense cyber security awareness certification. Kolkata Police, initially, wishes to keep the batches small, with each cop undergoing a minimum of 40-hour training. Those enrolling for computer hacking and forensic, network security and ethical hacking courses will be attending classes in small batches of 15. “The idea is to make the learning intensive. Cyber criminals are evolving each day and such programmes are always required to stay updated. This will help us react quickly and we will not have to wait for field experts to guide us at each step,” said a detective department officer. The classes are likely to start after Durga Puja. For those enrolling for the more generic security awareness certification, it will be a 16-hour course with as many as 50 personnel enrolling for each batch. Cops said they have invited bids from concerned trainers who can impart the globally acclaimed cyber security oriented training for Kolkata Police personnel. The syllabus has been drafted in line with the best investigation practices in the world and in consultation with experts. The course content will have various aspects that form the basic tools in probing cyber crimes. The forensics course will deal with computer forensics, OS forensics, network forensics, database forensics, Cloud forensics, malware forensics and mobile forensics. The course will also include web attack probe, investigation process, understanding of hard disk and file systems, data acquisition and duplication, defeating anti-forensics techniques, investigating email crimes, forensics report writing and presentations. The course on network security will begin with basic understanding of network security management.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/lalbazar-plans-specialized-pool-of-cyber-cops-lines-up-training-courses/articleshow/85910806.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Delhi||HC tells cops, govt to reduce number of Afghan protesters||New Delhi: Law has to be the same for everybody, Delhi High Court said on Friday, directing Delhi Police and the state government to ensure that the number of Afghan nationals protesting outside the UNHCR office in south Delhi is reduced and they strictly follow Covid-appropriate protocol. The court questioned the authorities on how 500 people had gathered for the protest when the guidelines permit 100 in events such as marriages. The court was hearing a petition by Vasant Vihar Welfare Association, which stated that the foreign nationals (refugees/asylum seekers) have gathered near the office of the United Nations High Commissioner of Refugees (UNHCR) at B Block in South Delhi’s Vasant Vihar since August 15, and residents are facing difficulties due to this. When the Centre’s counsel referred to Afghanistan’s political crisis and said the situation was unprecedented and not normal, the court made it clear that there was no question of being unreasonably harsh to anybody, but the law is the same for everybody. “Nobody is stopping them from protesting. Firstly they are at a wrong place. It is not a designated protest site. Plus, as per the Covid-19 guidelines, more than 100 people cannot gather. I will have to direct that there should not be more than 100 people. How can there be 500 protesters? What is this exception of 500 for refugees?” Justice Rekha Palli asked. Delhi Police stated that as per Delhi Disaster Management Authority guidelines, all congregations were prohibited during the pandemic. The court listed the matter for further hearing on September 7, saying if the matter is not resolved by then, it will be constrained to pass an order. “In the meantime, respondents 3 and 4 (Delhi Police and Delhi government) will ensure that Covid-19 protocols are strictly maintained and also ensure that the number of people protesting at the site be suitably reduced,” the judge said, adding that the city can’t be put at risk. During the hearing, the police earlier said that “children were also there in the protest for some duration and the officers tried to persuade the protesters to shift, but they were not agreeable and the only option left was to push them away which was not done since it was a sensitive issue having international ramifications.” The petitioner association claimed residents were facing difficulties in commuting and going to markets for purchasing essential goods, as people were staying there, littering, defecating in the open and encroaching upon the area and they were probably not even vaccinated for Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-tells-cops-govt-to-reduce-number-of-afghan-protesters/articleshow/85910834.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Delhi||Delhi: Key supplier of ammunition to gangs held||NEW DELHI: In a major breakthrough, Delhi Police’s Special Cell has arrested one of the key suppliers of bullets to gangs of Delhi-NCR and recovered a cache of 200 bullets from him. The suspect has been identified as Ram Krishan Singh alias Masterji (58), a popular teacher in his hometown in Bhojpur and neighbouring areas in Bihar, who doubled up as an ammunition supplier on the side. According to DCP (Special Cell) Pramod Kushwaha, the suspect was procuring bullets at around Rs 100 a piece and selling them for Rs 400-1,000 a piece depending upon the profile and the needs of the customer. If the customer seemed desperate and wanted the supply urgently, the price moved up accordingly. Singh had carved a niche for himself in the field of supply of ammunition. “Unlike pistols, bullets cannot be manufactured locally and are sourced from ordnance factories, police and military, and thus their suppliers are in high demand,” explained an officer. Singh was on the police radar for supplying cartridges to Maoists. “A team led by inspector Ravinder Tyagi had been trailing Singh and his associates for months. He was previously involved in multiple arms/ammunition trafficking cases in Munger (Bihar) and Delhi. He supplied guns and bullets to criminals of various states like Bihar, Delhi and NCR, including Naxalites of Odisha, Gadchiroli,” DCP Kushwaha said. The cops received information about his movements in Nizamuddin and laid a trap. He was nabbed with a bag containing five pistols of .32 bore and 200 cartridges of .315 bore. During interrogation, Singh disclosed that he had come in contact with a gangster who lured him in this trade in Bihar.

JMC, Greater and Heritage, have imposed trade licence which every businessman involved in trade of private hospital, nursing home, coaching centre, clinic, library, hostel or PG, tobacco seller will have to get a license paying a fee, on yearly basis. A fixed amount according to every business has been decided which owners have to pay. Subhash Goyal, president of Jaipur Vyapaar Mandal, said that at the time of pandemic anyways people are in losses then why should they pay licence fees. “We pay UD tax to the corporation, have to register under GST, firm registration fee under the labour department. With trade licence being imposed, smaller business will be affected that are still recovering from the losses due to pandemic. This is a black law that is being imposed on us. We will stage agitation if it is not taken back by the corporation,” said Goyal. Meanwhile, deputy of mayor of JMC, Greater, Puneet Karnawat has extended his support to the traders. He issued a statement on Friday, claiming the trade licences are unfair practice by the state government. Municipal corporation has said that Jaipur is not the first urban body to impose it. In Jodhpur Municipal Corporation, the trade license was implemented 25 years back. Moreover, recently 15th Finance Commission has stopped the grant for any civic work to the municipal corporations in the country. The grant from now on will be given for National Clean Air Project and Solid Waste management. Naveen Bhardhwaj, deputy commissioner revenue at JMC, Greater said, “There is a need to impose this taxation on every business as they are using corporation facility.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bizmen-warn-of-agitation-over-trade-licence-in-city/articleshow/85912990.cms||---

Her father, a BJP worker in UP’s Sambhal, staged protests outside the SSP’s office to get his daughter back. When she was found, six months into pregnancy, it turned out she had been with her father’s party colleague. Now, the rape survivor, 13, has said she went away of her own accord, wants to keep the baby and hopes her family will accept her relationship. The girl had moved to Moradabad to live with her maternal grandmother and study. She is a Class VIII student. But 15 days after she got there, on January 10, she went missing. Her maternal uncle filed a complaint, on the basis of which an FIR was lodged. In July, the Moradabad SSP formed five teams to look for her and the case was moved to Sambhal to speed up investigation. Her father, meanwhile, protested against the “inaction” of police in tracing her and said he believed Vishnu Sharma, 28, his fellow party worker, to be behind this. Sharma, too, was nowhere to be found. Then, one day, Sharma’s mobile phone, which had been switched off for months, suddenly beeped on the police radar. They traced the girl and Sharma to Delhi. She was pregnant. Sharma was arrested, and booked for rape, kidnapping and under the Pocso Act. He claimed he “didn’t know” she was a minor and thought she was 21. The girl has now said in her statement to the CWC that she had eloped with Sharma, a member of the CWC told TOI. The police investigation, too, pointed to the same. “The girl was in Baddi, Solan (Himachal Pradesh) for one and a half months by herself. Sharma joined her and they moved to Jammu, where they got married. After living there for a little over three months, they ran out of money. They went to Delhi,” said Majhola SHO Ashok Kumar. The CWC member said they sold fruits off a cart for a living in Delhi. “The girl said she planned on returning home after the delivery of her baby. She wants her parents to accept that,” the CWC member, who didn’t want to be named, said. “She was not aware of the laws (that make physical relationship with her, a minor, a crime). We told her she can’t get married until she turns 18. She said she’d wait.” Hari Mohan, another CWC member, said, “We have spoken with her parents and told them that medical termination of pregnancy will not be permitted. We have called them in for counselling on September 7 to understand what kind of societal pressure they expect or are facing.” Her family said she had been threatened into staying with Sharma. “My niece told us she was leaving for tuition. Sharma called her and said her father was not well. He took her away, gave her sedatives and threatened to kill her brother and father if she said anything,” her uncle told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/pregnant-rape-survivor-13-says-she-wants-to-keep-baby/articleshow/85908310.cms||---

He too took poison. The incident occurred about seven days ago, said an officer of Sola police on Friday. The officer said that the woman was in a relationship with the man about four years ago but had married another man about three years ago. She alleged in her complaint filed with Sola police on Thursday that Akshay Bharwad, 23, continued to pursue her even after her marriage. As Bharwad relentlessly threatened her with dire consequences, she decided to meet him a month ago. He allegedly took her to several pilgrimage places. She alleged that he had raped her during that period and continued to pressure her to leave her husband and marry her. She alleged that he later took her to a hotel in Gota where he consumed poison when she resisted his sexual assaults. She said in her FIR that he had made her consume poison too. Both fell very sick soon thereafter. Bharwad called some friends and they took both of them to a private hospital in Gota where a medico-legal case was filed. Sola police filed a complaint of rape and attempt to murder against Bharwad and arrested him.

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Woman missing for two years reunited with kin after accident||KOLKATA: An accident in south Kolkata on Wednesday provided cops with leads that helped them reunite the 56-year-old victim with her family in Nadia after two years. Charu Market cops handed over Sandhya Chakraborty, a woman with mental illness, to her family at Nadia’s Dhantala on Friday. She went missing from her home two years ago. Due to the Covid pandemic, her family, including her brother and niece, had given up hope of seeing her again. Both the siblings were in tears when they met, said cops from Kolkata, who helped her return home on Friday. According to police, the chain of events began around 10.35am on Wednesday when Sandhya was reportedly knocked down by a car at Jhaldar Math on Tollygunge Road. “She sustained a bleeding injury on her forehead and was treated at a hospital. The accused driver was arrested and the vehicle seized,” said police. “Initially, she had failed to give us her address at the hospital. But getting her shifted to Pavlov hospital meant we had to secure a court order. Even as that process began, we wished to take our chances and reunite her with her family. We counselled her for several hours before she could finally confirm her name as Sandhya. When she finally said she was from Dhantala, we knew we had a chance. Soon, OC Charu Market, Subhas Adhikary, decided to contact his counterpart at Dhantala. We also took help of an NGO and its counsellor,” said an officer, who played a crucial role in reuniting the woman with her family. Netai Mukhopadhay of Hive India — who has helped cops in hundreds of similar cases before — also joined them in this case. “The first thing was to make Sandhya comfortable and homely. Once she was at ease, she gave us certain hints. Our network is spread across several districts and leads slowly helped us to ascertain the place where she lived,” he said. “After an immediate search by Nadia police, the missing woman was identified and traced to the Purba Noapara village in Nadia. After handing her over to her family on Friday with the help of officer D Tamang, we were pleasantly surprised when villagers expressed their gratitude towards us,” said an officer from the Kolkata team after returning to the city on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/woman-missing-for-two-years-reunited-with-kin-after-accident/articleshow/85910839.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Hyderabad||Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao meets PM Modi, seeks land for Telangana Bhavan in Delhi||HYDERABAD: A day after laying the foundation stone for TRS party office in New Delhi, Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Friday requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to allot land for construction of Telangana Bhavan in the national capital. The chief minister, who called on the Prime Minister in Delhi, requested that Telangana be allotted land for construction of official building of state government - Telangana Bhavan - like other states, which have their state Bhavans in the national capital. A release from the chief minister’s office (CMO) said the PM responded positively and gave an assurance that land would be allotted for the purpose. Telangana and Andhra Pradesh have been using the old Andhra Bhavan even after bifurcation of the state. KCR, who met Modi after eight months, invited the PM for the inauguration of the renovated Yadadri temple to be held either in October or November this year. Modi agreed to attend the ceremony, the CMO said. During his 50-minute meeting, Rao also asked for sanctioning of more IPS officers, Rs 1,000 crore financial assistance for Mega Textile Park in Warangal, development of Hyderabad-Nagpur industrial corridor, IIIT for Karimnagar, IIM for Hyderabad, a tribal university, 21 Navodaya schools for the state, apart from seeking funds under Prime Minister Grameen Sadak Yojana. In separate representations on various issues, KCR said the present strength of IPS officers in the state, including senior duty officers, is 139 that needs to be increased to 194 in view of reorganizing the districts and police commissionerates. “Earlier there were only nine police districts and two commissionerates which have now been increased to 20 districts and nine commissionerates. However, the strength is as per the 2016 cadre allocation,” the chief minister said. On the Telangana government’s prestigious Mega Textile Park, the CM asked the PM to extend Rs 1,000 crore financial support for the park being developed in 2,000 acres in Warangal. While Rs 1,600 crore is required for infrastructure facilities, the government would bear the balance Rs 600 crore, he said. “Telangana is the second largest producer of cotton in India with over 60 lakh bales of long staple cotton production annually. There is an immense potential for value addition and growth in the textile sector at Warangal,” the CM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kcr-meets-modi-seeks-land-for-telangana-bhavan-in-delhi/articleshow/85914227.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Kochi||Kerala: Oommen Chandy sidelined, alleges Ramesh Chennithala||KOTTAYAM: Senior Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala lashed out at the current leadership of the party and said that senior leader Oommen Chandy has been sidelined in the discussions related to the organization. Inaugurating the swearingin ceremony of Nattakom Suresh as president of the Kottayam DCC, Chennithala said that he will not insist that the new leadership should consult him regarding the decisions. “I am just a ‘kaalana’ (inconsequential) member, but Chandy is the general secretary of the All India Congress Committee. Everybody has a responsibility to discuss matters relating to the organization with him,” said Chennithala. Meanwhile, Chandy was conspicuously absent in the function held in his home turf. Joshy Philip, the outgoing DCC president, in his speech said that Chandy normally does not attend swearing-in ceremony functions. Chennithala also said that it was a reality that there were issues within the Congress party in the state. “Chandy and I lead the party for17 years. During that period Congress party achieved big wins in several elections. Congress made a great comeback during our time,” he said. He also recalled the return of K Karunakaran and K Muraleedharan to the party during their time. Taking a dig at the new power centre of the state leadership of Congress party —opposition leader V D Satheesan and KPCC president K Sudhakaran — Chennithala said that this is not a relay competition. “A path of unity should be taken. All should be taken together and current leadership has the responsibility for that,” he said. On a lighter note, Chennithala said that when he is referred as a senior leader he is not that old. “I am only 63 whereas those saying that I am senior have reached 74-75,” he said. He also said that when Chandy and he were at the helm of the party, they never used the language of arrogance. He also dismissed the threat of party discipline wielded by the present leadership and said that many will not find themselves in the party now if the discipline they are talking about is implemented with retrospective effect. K C Joseph, senior leader and close aide of Chandy, who spoke at the function, said that party discipline should not be made one-way traffic. He said that the party leadership did not resist the social media attack against Chandy. The leadership did not give any strong reply to the cheap social media attacks against Chandy. No action was taken against them. At the same time, action was taken against Sivadasan Nair who criticised the leadership, Joseph said. Though Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan was also present at the function, he distanced himself from the ongoing controversies. The new developments in the Congress party here on Friday is a clear indication of the merger of the two groups led by Chandy and Chennithala. Meanwhile, the new president of Palakkad DCC A Thankappan took charge from the outgoing president VK Sreekantan, MP, here on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/chandy-sidelined-alleges-chennithala/articleshow/85910884.cms||---

Irrigation special chief secretary Rajat Kumar said in the affidavit that PRLIS did not involve any area either in the core zone or buffer zone of ATR. “A proposal for the eco-sensitive zone is pending. It will not fall even in the proposed eco-sensitive zone and the scheme is not in the 10 km radius,” he said. Rajat Kumar further said the government spent a lot on the project and any stoppage at this moment would result in a huge loss and escalation in costs. “It will also deprive Hyderabad of drinking water supply,” he said. He said the EIA notification would not apply to PRLIS. “There is an already existing reservoir, Srisailam, from which water will be drawn. This is flood water and it will not interrupt the flow of water into Krishna river. The scheme does not involve construction of dams or production of electricity.” He also said the process of getting an environmental clearance for the project was under way. Officials also said the diagram of PRLIS had established that there were no distribution ayacut branch canals envisaged nor was there any such proposal to construct them. Land acquisition for the project began in 2015 and work was awarded in 2016 after a tender process. The scheme is aimed at supplying water to upland areas of Telangana by utilising floodwater during the 60 days of flood season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-threat-to-amrabad-reserve-from-prlis-t-govt-tells-ngt/articleshow/85914231.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Budget hotels’ wait for land use change policy gets longer||JAIPUR: Inspite of provisions for land-use-change in Tourism Unit Policies 2007 and 2015 and Master Plan 2025, a policy still remains elusive. Now with the tourism industry coming under severe stress due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the budget hotels in the residential area are struggling to stay alive. Since the existing status of their land is residential, these budget hotels, which account for 80% of the room inventory in the city, are unable to raise money and restart the operations. At various levels of the government, including the chief secretary, the merits of land-use change has been appreciated and proposed. The UDH has also prepared the final draft. But so far, the policy for land use change of the budget hotels has not been rolled out. “We want the government to notify the policy as soon as possible because a lot of budget hotels are in serious distress condition due to lack of business. These hotels cannot raise money and pay staff and other fixed costs,” said AC Maini, patron of Hotel Association of Jaipur. Maini said while the domestic tourist movement has started, it is currently confined to the resorts and week-end tourists. “The budget hotels are not benefitting from the current movement of travelers. Unless the volume of tourists improves, the budget hotels will not get the business,” added Maini. He said the hotel industry is forced to pay fixed charges for electricity, and that too at the commercial rates which are very high. “We have been declared as industry in 1989, but the benefits are not extended to the budget hotels.” He said people need capital but the banks are not lending to the budget hotels because they are built on residential category of land. “That’s why it is urgent that the UDH permits the change in land use as soon as possible without which many of the hotels will go belly up,” he added. Ranvijay Singh, joint secretary, Hotels and Restaurants Association of Rajasthan said that most of the hotels are concentrated in and around bus stands and railway stations and they are as old as 40 years. Singh said, “The government has not given any meaningful stimulus to the hotel industry. But they can do so by announcing the policy which will not cause any additional fiscal burden on the state, rather increase its tax revenues.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/budget-hotels-wait-for-land-use-change-policy-gets-longer/articleshow/85913062.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

Citing a judgment rendered by another division bench of the court in 2008, the first bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice P D Audikesavalu said the court had held that there was nothing in the agamas or in other religious scripts to prohibit the chanting of mantras in Tamil in temples. The bench, in this regard, refused to accept the contention of a PIL-petitioner, Rangarajan Narashiman, that the state was purporting to interfere in the religious affairs and altering the religious practices of Hindu religious institutions in temples. Clarifying that it is for the devotees to opt either for Tamil or Sanskrit mantras, the court also held that the choice was vested with the devotees to seek for their archanas to be performed as per their wishes by chanting mantras either in Tamil or in Sanskrit, the judges added. “Judicial discipline commands that when an issue has been decided, unless the circumstances have changed or the decision on the issue is rendered suspect on account of the judgment not taking the applicable law into account or any pronouncement of a superior forum has intervened, the matter may not be revisited,” the court said. “There is no change in the circumstances and no case is made out for reconsidering a matter that has been concluded in 2008 and instructs the manner in which mantras may be chanted in temples in the state,” the court added. According to the petitioner, most of the temples have been set up according to the agama principles and it has been the age-old tradition for mantras to be chanted in Sanskrit. The very sanctity of the mantras is destroyed if not chanted in Sanskrit, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/tamil-mantras-in-temples-cannot-be-stopped-says-hc/articleshow/85910923.cms||---

There is no doubt that the number of Covid cases in Uttar Pradesh has gone down and now only a few hundred cases are left while 21 districts have no cases. However, experts say that opening of schools could be a risky affair. The warning from Niti Aayog indicates that the third Covid wave might not be far away, said Prof Ram Shankar Upadhayaya, an expert on infectious and communicable diseases. This brings us to the looming reality of how children would be affected, he said. While medical science is still grappling to understand the virological facets of Covid in adults, to predict its paediatric effects is an uphill task, Prof Ram believes. The Covid-19 virus, as of now, is a spectrum of mutants whose evolution has been largely beaconed by the adult immune response, he said and added that though it can only be conjectured, the possibility of a havoc in paediatric cases cannot be ruled out. Unlike adults, where community spread is the route of infection, in children, there are two possible ways, Prof Ram said. One may be from school and the other from parents/household adult members. This can be controlled if not stopped, he added. Governments should carefully analyse the progress of the third wave before opening such institutions, he said. “We can always make up for loss of education or quality of education in time. But if children get the infection, it may translate to serious short-term as well as long-term effects such as neurological or developmental disorders. Given the stark reality of post-Covid and ‘long Covid’ symptoms, paediatric complications might even be debilitating,” he warned. Secondly, parents should be careful in following Covid-appropriate behaviour. And more importantly, the guiding mantra should be ‘get vaccinated not only for yourself but for your future also’.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/health-experts-advise-caution-for-primary-kids-as-schools-reopen/articleshow/85913091.cms||---
---||Kozhikode||Police high-handedness flayed||Kozhikode: Opposition leader V D Satheesan lashed out against the police saying that a section of police officers was resorting to high-handedness by even threatening children and misbehaving with women. Satheesan told reporters in Kozhikode on Friday that instead of properly administering the police, the CM was supporting their misdeeds. He added that the Covid pandemic was not a matter of law and order but was a health issue and it should be dealt accordingly. Referring to the statement by CPI leader Annie Raja that an RSS gang existed in the state police, Satheesan said that the chief minister should have taken the remarks seriously and should have instituted a probe into the allegation. On the Muttil tree felling issue, he said the CM was taking action against the upright officials in the forest department who had helped unearthed the tree felling and protecting those who are facing allegations without even the knowledge of the forest minister. He reiterated that KPCC president K Sudhakaran has the final word on organizational matters of the Congress party in the state and added that the aim was to make it into a semi-cadre organization. Later, inaugurating the seminar on Malabar Rebellion organized by IUML district committee, Satheesan said that the historical episode could not be erased from the real history of the country even if ICHR removes the names of those who participated in the rebellion from the list of martyrs of Indian freedom struggle. He said that among the names which the ICHR has recommended removing from the list of martyrs also included ten Hindus which shows that the Malabar rebellion was not a communal riot.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/police-high-handedness-flayed/articleshow/85910934.cms||---

Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman recently unveiled an ambitious Rs 6 lakh crore National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) scheme that included unlocking value by involving private companies across infrastructure sectors ranging from passenger trains and railway stations to airports, roads and stadiums.Speaking to reporters at party office here, Shukla said, "In the last 70 years, all the properties that previous governments had created with public money are being sold at throwaway prices. How can this BJP government, the Modi government sell them when they have no right to sell them.”He said the Modi government had almost sold off Red Fort but due to strong resistance the government had to abandon the plan. He said the industrialists are also being given loan from public sector banks to own public properties which is first time happening in the country. "There are many institutions and public undertakings whose work can be done only by the governments because if they go into private hands then the public will be at the mercy of the private players," he added. Besides it is a threat to national security.State BJP president Satish Poonia said neither Red Fort in Delhi will be sold nor Amber Fort in Jaipur. "India is destined to become a superpower in the world under the leadership of Modiji. Our country has seen massive growth in the last seven years in all sectors," said state BJP president Poonia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/centre-selling-public-assets-at-throwaway-prices-rajeev-shukla/articleshow/85913093.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Plea alleges corruption by Uttarakhand Building and Other Construction Workers’ Welfare Board; HC directs state to submit preliminary investigation report by Monday||Nainital: The Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Friday directed the state government to submit the preliminary investigation report in alleged corruption at the state-run Building and Other Construction Workers’ Welfare Board by Monday. The bench of Justices Manoj Tiwari and Alok Kumar Verma was informed by the state government that a preliminary inquiry report into the alleged corruption will be presented before the court in a sealed cover. The court then listed the case for further hearing on Monday. A petition, filed by Kashipur-resident Khurshid Ahmed, has alleged that the Uttarakhand Building and Other Construction Workers’ Welfare Board released Rs 20 crore to a private construction company, 'Bridge and Roof India Limited' for the construction of a hospital in Kotdwar without receiving the nod for the same by the state government. Before this, the private company was awarded a contract worth Rs 50 crore to build the hospital. The petition further says that the money was released even though the land for the hospital is yet to be identified. In December last year, an inquiry was initiated in the matter. The probe committee submitted its report in March which found that Rs 20 crore were indeed siphoned off, however, the report is yet to be made public. In another instance, the board issued advertisements to procure sewing machines, cycles and other toolkits for its members. However, the purchases came under the lens after allegations of financial irregularities. Later, when a complaint was made to the governor, the board was dissolved and a new chairman was appointed. The new chairman Shamsher Singh Satyal conducted an inquiry into the case and found the involvement of several officials and political leaders in the alleged corruption. However, the government soon dismissed him and appointed another official to conduct the inquiry. Now, Singh has also approached the HC in the matter pleading that he should be made a party in the case since he is still the chairman of the board and knows about the alleged corruption. The Building and Other Construction Workers’ Welfare Board is an umbrella organisation created in 2000 for the welfare of the workers as well as to enforce various labour laws in the state. Its members include labourers, masons, electricians and plumbers involved in governmental and non-governmental projects. The board comes under the state government's department of labour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/plea-alleges-corruption-by-uttarakhand-building-and-other-construction-workers-welfare-board-hc-directs-state-to-submit-preliminary-investigation-report-by-monday/articleshow/85908380.cms||Prashant Jha

However, the health department has been on the wait-and-watch mode and has advised the public not to be complacent and continue following Covid-appropriate behaviour. Also, there has been a continuous dip in the number of active cases, which are now 86. No deaths due to Covid were reported. Since August 1, there has been no Covid deaths, which has been the saving grace. Also, patients with mild symptoms are seen at the hospitals. “People are getting admitted to the hospitals as a precaution even if they don’t have severe symptoms. A very negligible number of patients has oxygen dependency,” Dr Ajeet Singh, superintendent, RUHS told TOI. In Jaipur, only two cases of Covid were found, which came from Gopalpura and Bhankrota. Apart from Jaipur, one case each came from Alwar, Bikaner, Jalore, Jodhpur, Nagaur and Sikar.

This month’s rainfall will likely be at the lower end of normal for most parts of the state,” said Naga Ratna, in-charge director, IMD, Hyderabad, adding that the rainfall activity will subside after September 10. The southwest monsoon season, which entered last month, is responsible for 20% of precipitation. The city recorded up to 101mm rain on September 2 triggering flash floods in many parts of the city. According to the Telangana State Development Planning Society figures up to 8.30 am on Friday, Shaikpet recorded the highest rainfall of 101mm followed by 98.3mm at Yousufguda and Moosapet and 90mm at Madhapur. Many other areas such as Saroornagar, Bala Nagar, Srinagar Colony, Jeedimetla and Kukatpally recorded rainfall of 30-70mm. As per IMD figures from June 1 till date, Hyderabad has recorded 24% of excess rain to the tune of 580.6 mm of rain as against normal of 470mm. Overall, Telangana has recorded 28% of excess rain to the tune of 767.3mm as against normal of 601.6mm. Except districts such as Mulugu, Nagarkurnool, Peddapalli and Wanaparthy which are slightly deficit, all other districts in the state have received excess rainfall.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-likely-to-receive-heavy-rainfall-for-next-five-days/articleshow/85913170.cms||---

---||Lucknow||TOI honours education warriors who made teaching-learning a success in Covid times||Lucknow: The Covid-19 pandemic has profoundly disrupted schooling, raising serious concerns not only on children’s learning but also on their mental health. The crisis has led to a change in the way of teaching-learning activities. To recognise champions who broke the norms, changed the rules, exhibited tremendous capability to adapt to digital tools and delivered a superlative learning experience for students, The Times of India and Navbharat Times on Friday honoured these mentors who have made teaching and learning a success. Deputy CM Dinesh Sharma, the chief guest at the event, said that the pandemic helped us identify the potential in our teachers. “Despite challenges, we tried our best to strike a balance between two major stakeholders: schools and parents. Teachers played a vital role in dissemination of information through unconventional ways,” he said. While honouring education warriors, Sharma said, “We will ensure that UP Board students who were not given marksheets but were promoted are not denied the next grade. For children not satisfied with their scores, we are conducting an examination in the third week of September.” A panel discussion was also held where experts shared their experiences. Additional director, basic education, Lalita Pradeep, said that schoolgoing children and particularly those in primary classes were most hit by the pandemic. “But measures like formation of WhatsApp groups and mohalla classes became a hit. But even with all this, a large section of rural kids were left out due to lack of devices and internet connectivity. I believe teachers emerged as true warriors during the pandemic,” she said. Vice-chancellor of Atal Bihari Vajpayee Medical University Dr AK Singh said, “Covid brought several changes in our education system. Education was skill-based before the pandemic but now it has become machine-based. The ‘feel good’ part of any learning exercise totally went for a toss in this new normal.” For Amrita Dass, educationist and career consultant, students became self-learners during the Covid-19 pandemic. “Every child has the right to get the best education. For the differently abled children who cannot access technology, we should think of providing education counsellors so that their learning is not hampered,” she said. President of Unaided Private Schools Association Anil Agarwal said, “Every crisis is an opportunity. It’s true that online education is no substitute for classroom teaching, but it will certainly help us in filling gaps on days when schools are closed during extreme summer or winter. I thank teachers for putting in extra effort for the interest of students.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/toi-honours-education-warriors-who-made-teaching-learning-a-success-in-covid-times/articleshow/85913124.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Mumbai||Sachin Waze key player in Antilia case, Mansukh Hiran murder: NIA chargesheet||MUMBAI: Dismissed police officer Sachin Waze has emerged as the key player who masterminded the planting of explosives in a Scorpio near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence Antilia at Carmichael Road on February 25 and the subsequent murder of vehicle owner Mansukh Hiran, according to the chargesheet submitted by National Investigation Agency or NIA. Waze wanted to “regain his clout as an ace detective/ encounter specialist”, NIA said. He was reinstated in the force in June 2020, after 16 years of suspension in a case of custodial death of a 2002 bomb blast accused. So, he hatched a conspiracy to place the vehicle laden with gelatine sticks and a threat note addressed to Mukesh Ambani. He also tried to give the incident the tag of a terror plot. NIA on Friday submitted the chargesheet before special judge Prashant R Sitre against 10 accused, including Waze, retired encounter specialist Pradeep Sharma and inspector Sunil Mane. NIA: Waze tried to give terror hue to incidentSachin Waze masterminded the planting of explosives in a Scorpio and the murder of vehicle owner Mansukh Hiran , according to the NIA chargesheet. “Sensing a lot of commotion after detection of the explosive laden car, Waze pressured Mansukh Hiran to take responsibility for placing the vehicle, which was refused by Hiran. Thus he conspired with other co-accused Sunil Mane, Pradeep Sharma to eliminate Mansukh Hiran. He persuaded him to go into hiding till the matter gets settled and assured to facilitate the same,” NIA said. Sharma, a former police officer known as an encounter specialist, had a questionable background too. Waze had impressed upon Hiran to lodge a false complaint of theft of his Scorpio whereas the vehicle was taken by Waze himself, NIA said. To give credibility to the incident, Waze also “falsely projected the incident being committed by a terror organisation ‘Jaish Ul Hind’.” After transfer of the case from Gamdevi police station to CIU Mumbai, Waze became its investigating officer. NIA is also probing the role of a senior police officer in the conspiracy, sources said. The Delhi special cell had recovered a mobile handset from Tihar jail. The telegram account in the name of Jaish Ul-Hind, which was created, had claimed responsibility for the explosives-laden car. NIA believes this was done at the behest of Waze and the senior police officer. In furtherance of the conspiracy, another accused, police inspector Sunil Mane, picked up Hiran and handed him over to other co-accused Santosh Shelar, Anand Jadhav, Satish Mothkuri and Manish Soni, who killed him and dumped his body. Hiran's body was recovered from a creek in Kalwa on March 4. NIA, during one of the court proceedings, had said one of the accused had paid Rs 45 lakh to eliminate Hiran. For commission of this heinous crime, the accused have used exclusive mobile phones, benami SIM cards provided by Vinayak Shinde and Naresh Gor, NIA said. Waze had also conspired with API Riyazuddin Kazi to destroy the evidence collected during investigation being conducted by him while being investigating officer of the case in CIU Mumbai, in order to avoid detection. The chargesheet has been filed under IPC sections of murder, criminal conspiracy, kidnapping, negligence with explosive, extortion, dishonest misappropriation of property, cheating, forgery, counterfeit plate and criminal intimidation besides relevant sections of the Arms Act, Explosive Substances Act and Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. The 10 accused are Waze, Gujarat-based bookie Naresh Gor, murder convict constable Vinayak Shinde, API Kazi, inspector Sunil Mane, Pradeep Sharma, and associates Santosh Shellar, Anand Jadhav, Satish Mothkuri and Manish Soni. NIA in its nearly10,000 pages chargesheet has stated it will continue the probe. The NIA filed the chargesheet just two days before the stipulated period of 180 days under UAPA would end on Monday, thus enabling the accused to seek default bail. Special NIA judge Shintre has directed NI to hand over the copy of the chargesheet to all the accused in jail. The agency said there are around 200 witnesses, and of these, 20 are protected witnesses who have deposed before a magistrate and given statements under164 CrPC, which can be treated as evidence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/nia-waze-tried-to-give-terror-hue-to-incident-in-mumbai/articleshow/85914255.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: No-honking drive by cops & doctors on EM Bypass||KOLKATA: Patients admitted in hospitals, especially those off EM Bypass, face problems due to unnecessary honking, a nuisance for which the city witnesses 222 prosecutions daily. On the occasion of Road Safety Week on Friday, the Tiljala traffic guard held a two-hour ‘Gandhigiri’ that saw doctors and staff from Fortis Hospital join the initiative on the Bypass to make people aware that unnecessary honking should be avoided near hospitals as it causes an inconvenience to the patients. The relatives and kin of patients spoke to the violators, pointing how their “impatience” on the road turned out to be a major disturbance for those undergoing treatment at the hospital. The violators were handed over roses and cookies after they were made to take the pledge that they would not repeat the mistake of honking near hospital any more. The programme was carried out on the road near China Mandir in Anandapur and the EM Bypass Crossing that saw several motorists, including bikers, taxi drivers and cabbies, express a remorse for their mistakes. “I could have not honked at this spot when I saw the bicycle in front of me,” said Ayan Basu, a biker, who had come to meet a patient at another hospital. “This traffic guard has been facing the issue of unnecessary honking for a long time. We have been prosecuting 15-20 people daily on the stretch between Ruby Crossing and Uttar Panchannagram, which has multiple big and small hospitals. We wanted to make the motorists and bikers aware of the problems faced by patients in the hospitals. We thank Fortis Hospital for agreeing to partner us. Their presence only helped us highlight the seriousness of the issue,” said a senior officer from Tiljala traffic guard. In a statement, Fortis Hospital said, “The objective of the programme was to draw the attention of people to the fact that a little more patience and discipline in front of hospitals could be a big relief for the patients recovering from various diseases.” The Kolkata traffic police, who launched anti-honking drives across the city, especially outside vaccine centres and hospitals last month, have challaned nearly 2,664 motorists in 12 days with an average of 222 challans each day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/no-honking-drive-by-cops-docs-on-bypass/articleshow/85910977.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: One crore doses to speed up Covid vaccination drive this month||VISAKHAPATNAM: Andhra Pradesh will get nearly 1.04 crore Covid-19 vaccine doses in September under the Union government’s quota. This is the highest ever allocation made to the state for any month since the rollout of the mass inoculation drive in January. With this, the state can give the jabs to an average three lakh people a day this month. The increased allocations are expected to accelerate the ongoing vaccination process. Andhra Pradesh has so far administered 3.11 crore doses to nearly 2.22 crore beneficiaries, including the second dose recipients. The health department has recently thrown open the vaccination for the 18+ after the first dose coverage among the 45+ age group crossed the 90% mark. The coverage among the 45+ age group currently stands at about 96%, while it is 99% in healthcare workers and frontline staff. About 36% of the total registered beneficiaries in the 18-44 age group received their first shot by September 1. Efforts currently focused on vaccinating the young cohort to achieve the 100% vaccination among all the eligible sections. The state health officials are expecting that all those above 18 years will be provided with a single dose by November-end. In all, the first dose coverage among all the eligible adult population stood at about 58%. Even if 50% of these 1.04 crore doses are allocated to the people due for their second dose in September, the first dose coverage is expected to touch the 70% mark by this month end. There was vaccine hesitancy in the initial months of the launch of the drive. But it gained momentum with increasing daily Covid-19 infection numbers in the second wave from April-May. But for reasons unknown, the contribution of private hospitals to the overall vaccination numbers still continued to be minuscule. Despite the allocation of more than 40 lakh doses since May, the private hospitals could so far administer only about 6.6 lakh doses in Andhra Pradesh. Visakhapatnam district has given nearly 32 lakh vaccine doses, the highest among all the districts, followed by East Godavari (30 lakh).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/one-crore-doses-to-speed-up-vaccination-drive-this-month/articleshow/85910974.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Mumbai||Antimicrobial resistance is rising in India, says ICMR report||MUMBAI: More than 50% of the ICU patients battling a type of pneumonia caused by bacteria Klebsiella pneumoniae will not respond to powerful antibiotics called carbapenem. Another antibiotic, imipenem, will not affect a mutated form of Ecoli in three out of 10 cases. These are some of the findings of Indian Council of Medical Research’s latest report on ‘antimicrobial resistance research and surveillance’ conducted between January and December 2020, which underlines the growing antimicrobial resistance across India. Mutations in microbes, be they bacterium, viruses or fungi, are rendering medicines useless when the patients most need them; experts say this has been brought about by decades of overuse and misuse of antibiotics, antifungals and antivirals. As the Covid pandemic dominated 2020, the ICMR data collection too was hit; only 65,000 culture reports could be collected from 30 tertiary care hospitals across India as against 1 lakh samples collected in 2019. Most hospitals were closed to non-Covid patients and only the severely ill ventured to hospitals during Covid. “The ICMR has brought out an exhaustive AMR report for the fourth time, and while some microbes have become more resistant and others have become more susceptible (to treatment), the overall picture remains the same,” said senior ICMR scientist Dr Kamini Walia, who has been leading the AMR project. Due to Covid-19, the use of antibiotics increased and scientists fear that resistance will definitely increase in the near future. Dr Rahul Pandit, who heads the ICU in Fortis Hospital, Mulund, said carbapenem resistance is evident in almost 50% of the patients. “When we notice carbapenem resistance, we give the patient the last resort antibiotic, colistin. We have run out of options left with us to treat patients,” said Dr Pandit, who was not associated with the ICMR project. While colistin works in most cases, there are already stray cases of resistance being reported. The ICMR report 2020 said five of the organisms posed a big worry: Escherichia coli (or Ecoli) was found in almost a fourth of the samples, followed by the Klebsiella pneumoniae (18%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12%), acinetobacter baumannii (10.4%) and staphylococcus aureus (9.6%). “The AMR trends and patterns are worrying. The Covid situation has only made the situation worse,” said Dr Walia. In the 2020 report, the Ecoli track showed an aberration: Susceptibility of Ecoli to antibiotic Imipenem that had increased from 86% in 2016 to 63% in 2019 showed a slight recovery to 72% in 2020. However, Klebsiella pneumoniae dropped from 65% in 2016 to 46% in 2019 and remained at 45% in 2020. Acinetobacter baumannii, which causes a relatively simple infection to treat, has emerged as a worry in the past few years, accounting for almost a tenth of the samples in 2020. Dr Pandit said the need of the hour is to hold an antimicrobial stewardship programme that will lay down stringent rules on use of these drugs. “But such programs work only in hospital settings. In India anyone can prescribe and sell an antibiotic, leading to large-scale misuse and resistance,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/antimicrobial-resistance-is-rising-in-india-says-icmr-report/articleshow/85913195.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Nagpur||Residents oppose NMC plan for girls hostel on Nelco Socy playground||Nagpur: Yet another sprawling playground is likely to be converted into concrete jungle. On the request of Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT), Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has started the process to change reservation of the playground for construction of girls hostel. Spread over 1.24 hectare, the lush-green cricket ground is in the Nelco Gruhnirman Sahakari Sanstha layout at Trimurti Nagar in mouza Parsodi. There is also a children's play area and green gym. Four years ago, NMC had constructed a walking track and chairs with Rs40 lakh sanctioned by the then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. A couple of days ago, a delegation of Nelco Society Nagrik Samiti met Fadnavis, municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B and others, and submitted a memorandum opposing the project and demanding the playground be retained. “People are residing in this society since 2000, and this is the only playground. From children to senior citizens, all use it. We are shocked at NIT’s plan for a girls hostel in well developed playground. This is open space of the layout. NIT or NMC never informed us. Every resident is opposed to the proposal,” said secretary Manohar Pande. Samir Sahasrabudhe, who runs the cricket club, said, “The land was full of grass, weed and garbage. Society asked us to develop it and we spent lakhs on it in 2010. Over 75 cricket players practice here daily.” Despite being open space of the layout, NIT had imposed reservation of primary school and library on it in 2000. Now, NMC has proposed to change reservation to public and semi-public. President Yoganand Kale said society residents will not allow people with vested interest to grab the public land. As per letter submitted by society to NMC, they was told by public representatives that correction was made by deleting the reservation of primary school and library on the playground. As per development control regulations (DCR), open space should be open to sky and only 15% of total area can be constructed, that too for sports purposes only. Radhakrishnan said, “I received objection from the society. We will consider their views and hear NIT. A decision will be taken to safeguard the interests of the people. We too believe playgrounds should be conserved and are taking efforts to develop more playgrounds, gardens and recreational facilities.” NIT had developed some 125 playgrounds across the city and invited applications from sports associations for operation and maintenance. In May, NIT had started the process to allot part of a playground in Naik Layout, near Nelco Society, for oxygen plant of a private hospital. IN A NUTSHELL * Nelco Society layout exists since 2000 * Society asked spots club to develop sprawling playground * Club spent lakhs and developed cricket ground in 2010 * NMC constructed walking track, green gym, children play area etc using Rs40 lakh CM funds four years ago * NIT imposed reservation of primary school and library in 2000 though land was open space of layout * NIT proposes to develop girls hostel on playground * NMC started process to change reservation to public and semi-public on NIT’s request * Local residents and sportsperson oppose project||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/residents-oppose-nmc-plan-for-girls-hostel-on-nelco-socy-playground/articleshow/85910455.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Dehradun||Former Uttarakhand CM Harish Rawat says he faces acid attack threat, posts it on Facebook||DEHRADUN: Former Uttarakhand chief minister Harish Rawat has created a stir after alleging that an acid attack, instigated by a “political rival”, could occur on some identified Congress leaders, including him, during the party’s election campaign for 2022 polls in the hill state. Rawat, who is heading the Uttarakhand election campaign committee for 2022, made the allegations on a Facebook post on Thursday, a day before the Congress took out its Parivartan yatra from US Nagar's Khatima — the home turf of CM Pushkar Singh Dhami. Agriculture minister and government spokesperson Subodh Uniyal, commenting on Rawat’s Facebook post, said the Congress leader is worried his “past would come back to haunt him”. “Rawat has done many injustices to workers of his party and he fears he will reap what he sowed. He should have approached police and produced evidence to substantiate his allegations so those planning such a crime could be arrested,” he said. The senior Congress leader told TOI on Friday that two or three senior Congress leaders, including him, could face an acid attack. “The aim is to disrupt our election campaign and criminal elements are being brought forward for this purpose. Two individuals have alerted me to this on separate occasions,” added Rawat. Rawat, who is also general secretary of the All India Congress Committee (AICC), said, “My message is to alert everyone — be it our party members or police. Now it is up to the administrative authorities to act on the matter. There should be no scope for violence in politics.” In his online post, the veteran politician had said: “…There should be healthy competition in politics, but if you attack your political rival by instigating students or by motivating some people to mix acid in ink and throw it ... during the Congress yatra, it will be a black chapter in state politics. If it happens, then one can easily make out the political party behind the move.” Rawat, who is also Congress’ Punjab in-charge, cleaned the premises of Gurdwara Shri Nanakmatta Sahib, located 17 km from Khatima, as “atonement” for his ‘Panj Pyare’ remark. He also cleaned shoes of devotees. TOI had earlier reported that Rawat would sweep the gurdwara to apologise for his comments that sparked a controversy. Rawat had termed Punjab PCC chief Navjot Singh Sidhu and the party’s four working presidents appointed recently as “Panj Pyare” — five beloved of the Guru. He later apologised and said that he had made a mistake and that “Panj Pyare can’t be compared with any other”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/harish-rawat-says-he-faces-acid-attack-threat-posts-it-on-fb/articleshow/85906289.cms||Kautilya Singh

The university has issued a show cause notice to the teachers, one from a pharmacy institute in Azamgarh and the other from an engineering college in Meerut. परीक्षा विभाग द्वारा स्वतः संज्ञान लेते हुए शिक्षक को परीक्षा के समस्त कार्यों से विरत करते हुए उसके खिलाफ सख्त अनु… https://t.co/2scvAlMPqS— AKTU (@AKTU_Lucknow) 1630598053000The action came late Thursday evening after a student from Meerut shared the screenshots of a message (sent by the accused teacher) on social media and pleaded for action. Responding to the complaint, secretary, technical education, Alok Kumar assured of suspension. Hours later, AKTU tweeted: “A case of harassment of a student by a teacher on proctorial duty has come to light during exams. The examination department has taken note and relieved the accused teacher from all examination-related duties. The college concerned has been asked to initiate the process of suspension and present the disciplinary action report within 24 hours.” AKTU’s examination controller Anurag Tripathi issued the show cause notice to the teachers – Azimuddin from Rahul Sankrityayan College of Pharmacy, Azamgarh, and Sandeep Kumar from Meerut Institute of Engineering and Technology, Meerut – seeking an explanation from them, while relieving them from examination duty for three years. While the complaint against Sandeep Kumar was lodged on social media, in case of Azimuddin, the complainant said that he sent irrelevant messages to distract and disturb her which was unacceptable. “It also consumed precious minutes of the time allotted to me. Such messages from the proctor put me at risk during the examination,” the complainant said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/2-aktu-teachers-off-exam-duty-after-harassment-taint/articleshow/85913151.cms||Isha Jain

Ernakulam and Kasaragod are also on alert on September 6 and 7. Squally weather with wind speed reaching 40-50kmph is likely from September 5 to 7 and fishermen are advised not to venture into sea during this period. Strong winds with speed reaching 40-50kmph gusting to 60kmph is likely over southwest and west central Arabian Sea. A thunderstorm with lightning is very likely to occur at one or two places in Kerala till Sept 7. A low-pressure area is likely to form over north & adjoining central Bay of Bengal around September 6. A shear zone also persists over south peninsular India during next 4-5 days. Also, a cyclonic circulation lies over eastcentral Bay of Bengal in middle tropospheric levels. These conditions are likely to influence enhanced rainfall activity with widespread rainfall, with isolated heavy falls likely over Kerala from September 5 to 7. However, IMD said that there is a ‘low’ probability of the low-pressure area which is likely to form around September 6 becoming a depression over northwest & adjoining west-central BoB during the subsequent 24 hours. Formation of another low-pressure area in quick succession over central parts of the BoB is also likely during the first half of second week. According to the extended range forecast, there will be above normal rainfall over the state till September 9. In the August 26 - September 1 week, there has been 143% increase in rainfall.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/isolated-heavy-rainfall-alert-in-state-from-sunday/articleshow/85911035.cms||---
---||Mumbai||In abetment case, Bombay HC denies bail to sexually abused girl’s accused uncle||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court has denied bail to a married man accused of sexually harassing his minor niece and abetting her suicide. Instigation can have no straitjacket formula and must be inferred from circumstances of a case, said Justice Bharati Dangre. The child’s adolescent years were shaped by harrowing experiences and memories, a fear of stigma, of not being believed and being blamed. She found herself in a precarious situation, isolated and insecure, which persuaded her to end her life, said Justice Dangre, adding that the case from Pune depicted a “woeful and dismal picture’’. The accused, a matured married man, deserves no liberty also because as a kin he may pressurise prosecution witnesses and tamper with the case, said her order on Wednesday. The girl was 17 when she “jumped’’ from their balcony, and died 41 days later in hospital. Hours earlier, the HC noted, she wrote a note to her mother. “Mummy, I have not told you about one person. XXX (name withheld) uncle in our house. For no reason, he often come(s) close to me and attempts to touch my private parts. I concealed it from you and that was my mistake...’’ it said. In hospital, when she was asked why she took the extreme step, she had murmured her paternal uncle’s name. The mother filed an FIR against him more than three months later, after the family had mused whether to proceed against him as he is a “close relative’’ and a “powerful person”. The counsel for the accused said the allegation is of “an attempt’’ and not of actual touching and denied the charges. At best, it was a “moral blunder’’, he argued. He added that the note discloses no intention of suicide and, citing the recent Supreme Court order in TV anchor Arnab Goswami’s case, argued that in the absence of any acts attributed to him, he could not be held responsible for abetment of suicide. The girl’s extreme step has to be viewed through a prudent, not over-sensitive mind, the counsel said, adding that chargesheet has been filed and his client’s continued custody is not warranted. Justice Dangre held that the note “is an expression of despair and her anguish. It reflects her desperation and pain”. “She is a girl in formative years and her writing gives an impression that she feels trapped. It is possible that any other girl in similar circumstances would have responded in a different way… but given that the accused is her own uncle, she displayed absolute inhibition to embroil him in accusation…,’’ said her order. In abetment of suicide, instigation requires a reasonable certainty to incite and depends on intention of person who abets, said the court. While it is true that words uttered in a fit of anger or omission cannot be considered to be instigation, “it is possible that there may not be direct evidence to instigation which may bear a direct nexus to suicide”, the HC added. Inference will have to be drawn from surrounding circumstances to see if “a person felt totally frustrated and committed suicide”. The chit the girl left behind said she feared the family might quarrel if she disclosed that her uncle was texting her “about bad things’’. She had stored screenshots in her mobile phone: on one of her photos, the accused had written “you are looking very hot’’. In another, he wanted to speak with her privately and she responded that he was like her father. He asked her to “clear chat”. “I have blocked him but yesterday night, he texted me. I was unable to understand what I should do and how I should disclose it… you and papa should not fight. Bye…take care… Even though I blocked him on mobile, I will have to face him some day… no matter how much I tolerate, I will be blamed,” said her note.

The Kolkata Municipal Corporation that started repairing the road after the demolition of Posta flyover has taken into account a few issues raised by the Howrah Bridge traffic guard regarding a 250-metre stretch between Mirbarai Ghat Street Crossing- KK Tagore Street Crossing on Strand Road. Traffic cops have met the officials of the KMDA-appointed agency and KMC road department in the past two days and they have jointly inspected the Strand Road. Cops showed them the stretch has become uneven and in some of its places, where the equipment was placed for the demolition work, deep craters have come up due to rains. Cops said that the movement of trucks on this stretch might lead to accidents and frequent breaking of axle rods. Cops have also pointed out to the officials that 20 street lights and CCTV cameras installed on the posts have been removed for the work. “We have explained our concerns in detail to the officials of the civic body and pleaded with them to expedite the work so that we can reopen the entire stretch by the middle of next week. The MG Road takes heavy vehicular loads with all bus routes to Girish Park from Howrah plying on this stretch. With a portion of Vivekananda Road shut for the second phase of the Posta flyover demolition work and a few roads made one-way for this, traffic cops in central Kolkata are under pressure. With Durga Puja shopping set to pick up a pace, we want to open this road as soon as possible,” said an officer. The KMC officials wanted some more time to complete the work. The first task , they said, was to level the road by removing the top layer and filling the craters. “We are not going in for thorough overhauling of the road because of the intermittent rains,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/posta-demolition-strand-rd-likely-to-open-by-next-week/articleshow/85911005.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Videos from the locality, circulated widely on social media, showed water gushing through its roads, sweeping away pushcarts and stationary vehicles. In one clip a man being washed away is seen, rescued by a bystander in the nick of time. “The entire stretch of road was under water. We have experienced water-logging in the past too, but haven’t seen anything like this before. We request the authorities to clear the nalas that are obstructing the free flow of water during heavy rains. If this is just the result of two hours of rain, we cannot imagine what will happen if it rains continuously for a few more hours,” said K Rajashekar, a resident of Krishna Nagar. Commuters were seen stranded from Yousufguda main road to Kotla Vijay Bhaskar Reddy indoor stadium. “The water coming from upstream has flooded the residential colonies in the downstream. This area is full of poor and middle-class people who come from other districts and neighbouring states to find a job in the city. These pushcarts being swept away or the valuables at their houses being destroyed due to inundation can cost them their future,” said T Suresh, another resident. When contacted, U Raj Kumar, executive engineer (Yousufguda circle) said, “The entire water from Jubilee Hill checkpost flows down to this area.Since it is a downstream area, the water gets accumulated here but clears within 20 to 25 minutes because after reaching this point, we have proper channels for the water to escape. ”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pushcarts-vehicles-get-washed-away-in-yousufguda/articleshow/85913217.cms||---

As per CM Yogi Adityanath’s directives, the committee will seek details of vacant posts in state-run primary and upper primary schools and will also work for creation of new posts. The panel is headed by Revenue Board chairperson with secretary basic education and secretary basic education council as members. It has been directed to submit a detailed report on teaching vacancies soon. In a high-level meeting with officials of the basic education department on Friday, CM enquired about the teaching and learning activities in the schools post resumption of regular classes for students of classes 1 to 5 from September 1. Stressing on the need to tap the potential of newly inducted teachers, Yogi also told officials to maintain the ideal teacher-student ratio in schools. For this, creation of new posts is required along with appointment of teachers on vacant posts in schools, he added. The CM also told officials to complete the remaining work under ‘Operation Kayakalp’ under which government schools are being given a makeover.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cm-forms-panel-to-review-teaching-posts-in-schools/articleshow/85913211.cms||---

---||Delhi||Electrodes in brain new hope for severe cases of epilepsy||NEW DELHI: Neurosurgeons at All India Institute of Medical Sciences have devised a new technique for operating on children suffering from a severe form of epilepsy that cannot be controlled by drugs. It involves drilling small holes in the brain and passing electrodes through them to burn the interface between the damaged and the healthy parts of the brain. At least six patients, including a five-month-old baby, have already undergone the procedure successfully, according to Dr P Sarat Chandra, professor of neurosurgery at AIIMS, who led the team that devised the new technique. The innovative technique made it to the cover of Journal of Neurosurgery (Paediatrics), a top-rated medical journal. Epilepsy affects nearly 10 million people in India. While most patients can manage with medications, a few require surgical management. Chandra said the new technique can help thousands suffering from a severe form of the disease where seizures arise from one half of the brain. The conventional form of treatment for such cases involved removing the damaged part of the brain entirely (hemispherectomy) or disconnecting the damaged part (hemispherotomy) from the healthy portion. This is not only complex but also poses a high risk. Robotic thermos-coagulative hemispherotomy (ROTCH) involves using robotic guidance to drill small holes in the skull to avoid a large incision to access the brain. Electrodes are introduced into the holes and radio waves ablate, or burn, the interface the right hemisphere and the left hemisphere, thus disconnecting the diseased hemisphere from the healthy one. Dr Chandra explained that the new surgical technique was more accurate, effective and guided by advanced robotic systems and, most importantly, caused minimal or no blood loss. “Radiofrequency has been used in the past also to treat different forms of epilepsy but this is the first time that it has been used to disconnect an entire hemisphere of the brain from the rest of the organ,” he said. One of the patients to undergo the surgery using the novel technique at AIIMS was a five-month-old boy, who developed epilepsy when just three days old. There was twitching and involuntary movement in the left upper hand that spread to the whole left side of the body. The family consulted a family physician and were referred to a neurologist who started the baby on medication. But the intensity and frequency of seizures only increased. MRI showed a right hemispheric cortical dysplasia, a rare disease characterised by the presence of short-circuited neurons causing the generation of excessive ‘electricity’ and so uncontrolled epilepsy. The patient was referred to AIIMS, where neurologist Dr Manjari Tripathi advised surgery after detailed examination. Chandra, who led the team of neurosurgeons operating on the boy, said the procedure took about nine hours. “The infant became seizure-free immediately after surgery and now is two years old with development milestones and continues to suffer no seizures,” he said. For the parents, it was like their son getting a rebirth. Once the few sutures were removed, the parents couldn’t even make out the surgical site, the neurosurgeon claimed. Untreated, most such patients would eventually die of the uncontrolled seizures. AIIMS is also among the first medical institutions in India to develop robotic guided stereo encephalography, a highly complex procedure in which electrodes are introduced robotically to identify the seizure networks in patients who show normal MRI results. “Of the 10 million people in India with epilepsy, two million, children and young adults included, have drug-resistant epilepsy and require surgical therapy,” said Dr Manjari Tripathi. Tripathi added, “With epilepsy in the family, there is stigma and the entire family’s productivity goes down, usually because society has several misconceptions about epilepsy. Nearly 75% of epilepsy can be treated and cured with medications. About 25% of persons with epilepsy are drug resistant and surgery is the only effective option.” This is why there is a big need to develop specialised epilepsy centres with advanced modality of treatments to address this treatment gap.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/electrodes-in-brain-new-hope-for-severe-cases-of-epilepsy/articleshow/85913226.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Racecourse to get new Rs 45-crore jumbo centre months after older one dismantled||MUMBAI: After keeping its plan on hold for three months, the BMC has finally decided to go ahead with erecting a new jumbo Covid centre at Mahalaxmi Racecourse in anticipation of the third wave. The BMC will now spend around Rs 45 crore on constructing the centre at the same location where a 900-bed jumbo centre was dismantled early this year without admitting a single patient.  In June, with Covid-19 cases dropping drastically, the BMC had put on hold its plan to build the new jumbo centre. While the BMC had floated tenders for the centre, it looked for corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds for the project too. Corporates, though, found the centre too expensive to build. The BMC is now going ahead with the plan. The new centre will have 205 ICU beds and 250 oxygen beds. It will also have a triage area for stabilising patients and its oxygen facility. While the earlier centre was built using CSR funds, the BMC will spend around Rs 45 crore on the new one. Three companies had offered to build it and participated in the tenders. Officials, though, said there was cost escalation in the bids.  The BMC has been facing flak from the opposition for poor planning and having to spend Rs 45 crore. The facility, built by Naman Group, was handed over to the BMC in July 2020. BJP corporator Vinod Mishra said, “Even if it is CSR funds, it was money meant for the public. And now again they will spend Rs 45 crore. By the time the centre is ready, it may not be needed again.” When contacted, Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner (health), said, “We have completed all the formalities but kept the work order on standby for now. If there is a surge in cases, then we will erect this jumbo centre. We have allotted the contract in a transparent manner. We will use all the jumbo centres optimally and ensure that there is no waste of money.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-racecourse-to-get-new-rs-45-crore-jumbo-centre-mths-after-older-one-dismantled/articleshow/85913237.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Hubballi||Poor turnout to elections to civic agencies in N K’taka||Belagavi/Hubbali/Kalaburagi: Poor turnout and peaceful polling marked the election to the civic bodies of Belagavi, Hubballi-Dharwad and Kalaburagi on Friday. The threat of Covid-19 having restricted campaigning, the fear of a prospective third wave of the pandemic appeared to have kept a bulk of the voters away. Of the 17.4 lakh eligible voters in the three urban centres, only 8.7 lakh exercised their franchise. As many as 1,045 candidates were in the fray across the three North Karnataka cities in the election held on Friday.Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai will hope for a good showing by the BJP in the elections, given that it is the first electoral exercise being held since he assumed office. An impressive performance by the saffron party in the civic polls will help Bommai silence dissenting voices within the party, while shoring up his profile across the political spectrum.For the Congress, winning any of the three civic polls would buoy the party’s cadre in North Karnataka, where it has been steadily losing ground. Moreover, a win would set the stage for the party as it prepares for the zilla panchayat and taluk panchayat elections.The fate of 385 candidates hangs in the balance in the election to the Belagavi City Corporation, with three parties vying for power in the urban local body – BJP, Congress and Maharashta Ekikaran Samiti. Till 5pm on Friday, only 50% of the voters had exercised their franchise. In the 2013 election to the civic body, the voter turnout had been 56%.Meanwhile, Congress leader and Belagavi Rural MLA Laxmi Hebbalkar complained to the Election Commission about BJP workers allegedly distributing voter slips bearing the party’s symbol and the picture of Prime Minister Narendra Modi at polling booths in one of the wards in Belagavi.Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) working president Satish Jarkiholi, exuding confidence of the party’s victory in the civic polls, said that people were fed up with the BJP, which had failed to control surging prices. Meanwhile, BJP’s Belagavi South MLA Abhay Patil said that the young voters, inspired by PM Modi’s leadership and his developmental initiatives, would propel the saffron party to power.Polling peaceful in twin citiesBarring a few minor incidents, polling to the Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation (HDMC) Council was largely peaceful on Friday. As many as 402 candidates are in the fray in the twin cities. Although there was a lull in polling activity in the morning, voters started pouring into the booths in larger numbers as the day progressed. By the end of the day, voter turnout in the twin cities was 53.8%. Minor clashes were reported between candidates in wards three and six, with candidates from the BJP being involved in a row with an Independent and the Congress aspirant respectively.Among the prominent personalities who cast their vote on Friday were former chief minister Jagadish Shettar and Union minister and Dharwad MP Pralhad Joshi.48% turnout in K’buragiElection to all 55 wards comprising the Kalaburagi City Corporation passed off without incident on Friday. Voter turnout was 47.7% in the city, the poorest among the three urban centres where elections were held.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/poor-turnout-to-elections-to-civic-agencies-in-n-ktaka/articleshow/85908585.cms||---
---||Delhi||Former SC judge writes to Kejriwal for resumption of services at religious places||New Delhi: Former Supreme Court Judge Kurian Joseph on Friday wrote to Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal requesting him to allow resumption of services and worship at religious places while pointing out that continuing with the restriction on religious rights would be unconstitutional when the government has allowed reopening of restaurants, bars and theatres. Praising the AAP government for its "commendable work" in containing the pandemic, Justice Joseph said the Delhi Disaster Management Authority "many activities like restaurants, bars, theatres, and auditoriums have been permitted to resume operations with 50% of the seating capacity, from 31st August 2021. Weekly markets and spas are also permitted. The permissible number of people who can attend services like funerals and marriage has been increased to 100." "These are positive markers indicating the society getting back to normalcy. However, the restriction in the Order, 'religious places shall be permitted to open, but no visitors will be allowed' still continues. As you may recollect, before the second wave, the restrictions had already been relaxed and services had resumed in places of public worship, with restricted numbers and respecting other Covid-19 protocols. Restrictions were reintroduced only on account of the second wave of the pandemic, which now has perceptively thinned down significantly,” he said. Joseph, who had stirred a controversy in April 2015 by writing to PM expressing his inability to attend a conference of judges and chief ministers that was held on Good Friday, said, "Permitting religious worships and services in places of public worship would not otherwise cause any adverse impact, factoring other permitted activities."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/former-sc-judge-writes-to-kejriwal-for-resumption-of-services-at-religious-places/articleshow/85911088.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Teachers to be felicitated for work during pandemic: Uttar Pradesh govt||LUCKNOW: The state government has decided to felicitate teachers at district level to recognise the exemplary work done by them during the coronavirus pandemic. The government had to skip the teachers’ day felicitation last year due to the pandemic. Issuing guidelines to officials, the government on Friday said in every district, 75 teachers each from the three education departments – basic, secondary and higher – will be felicitated. As per the directives, teachers will be selected on the ground that they and the institution they belong to hold a good name in the district and that they have helped raise the academic standards of their school in previous years. The selected teacher must have shown excellence in both work and behaviour. An important criterion for selection of teachers is their contribution to online teaching during Covid-19 pandemic. Also, the teacher should have contributed immensely in increasing enrolment and strengthening of infrastructure through community participation. The teacher should have made use of information and communication technology during teaching-learning. As per the government order, recognition of teachers in basic education should be done in a way that it has adequate representation from private schools, in secondary education. While 50% of teachers from government secondary schools will be honoured, 50% will be selected from private institutions. In higher education, a teacher’s contribution in implementation of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, restructuring of syllabus, organising webinars on NEP, uploading of e-content on the UP higher education digital library and bringing innovation in teaching-learning will be the key areas for selection. A committee with two representatives from the university, regional higher education officer/senior principal of a government degree college, and a DM-nominated member will choose the teachers who will be felicitated. The event will be held at university/college auditoriums. The felicitation ceremony for all education departments will be attended by government representatives, like district magistrates, as chief guest. Both basic and secondary education department will also felicitate 73 and 17 teachers, respectively, for 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/teachers-to-be-felicitated-for-work-during-pandemic/articleshow/85913266.cms||---

Some contesting as rebel candidates will not have any impact on our candidates,” he added.The BJP leader admitted that some miscreants threatened their party candidates, even from jail over phone. “The party leaders have instilled confidence among such candidates and police have taken action. Such threats will fall flat against the people’s support,” he noted.When Shettar was asked about Shah’s decision on going to the next assembly polls under Basavaraj Bommai’s leadership, the former CM said he is committed to decisions taken by the party brass. But when he was further questioned citing his earliest stand on not joining the Bommai cabinet, and fighting the next election under him, Shettar quipped with a smile: “Assembly elections are far away (in 2023). We will wait and see what happens then. I will work as a disciplined party worker.” When asked whether the party was not according respecting the seniors, Shettar said: “Opinion has been expressed at an appropriate forum.” Claiming that the ever-increasing fuel prices will not affect the ULB poll outcome, Shettat said: “The price rise is not a new phenomenon — it existed even during the government of other parties.

And of the 25,539 HCWs, 15,884 had got the second dose.A health department official said, “Since the government announced a gap of 84 days, a large number of persons is yet to get the second dose. A number of HCWs and FLWs haven’t got the second dose and have been asked to receive it.”District immunization officer Dr Puneet Juneja was not available for comments. “I think the HCWs and FLWs who haven’t got the second dose feel there is no need for it as Covid cases are declining. It is important for the eligible persons to get both the doses to protect themselves from the disease. A single dose will not help achieve it. The authorities must motivate people to get both the doses,” said former senior medical officer Dr Rajinder Gulati.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/many-healthcare-and-frontline-workers-have-not-gone-for-2nd-dose/articleshow/85908590.cms||Shariq Majeed

NMPML, a transport wing of the Nashik Municipal Corporation, rolled out the city bus service from July 8. It deployed 51 buses by August-end, including 20 CNG and 31 diesel buses, on 13 routes. The Maharashtra Natural Gas Ltd (MNGL) is providing CNG through tankers for the buses on a daily basis at three CNG stations in the city. The supply, however, was sufficient for only 20 CNG buses. NMPML wanted to deploy more CNG buses on some busy routes from Nashik Road but could not due to inadequate supply. NMPML had requested MNGL to provide adequate supply of CNG so that it can deploy 25 more CNG buses. “We are getting good response from the passengers. Daily passenger footfall was only 4,000 a day when we started from the second week of July. Now, the passenger footfall has increased up to 20,000 a day,” said NMPML officials. “With the introduction of the 25 more buses, we are expecting the footfall to increase further,” added NMPML officials. NMC has deployed two private agencies on basis of procuring, operating, maintaining and managing city buses. Both the agencies have procured a total 250 buses, including 200 CNG buses. CNG buses are 48- seater and diesel buses are 28-seater.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/better-cng-supply-helps-ply-25-more-buses-in-nashik/articleshow/85877109.cms||Tushar Pawar

The officials who were part of the meeting, said that the Centre had proposed that 40% share of the nearly Rs 1,000 crore project will have to be borne by the state and the same can also be obtained under the various schemes of the Union government. However, the state government proposed that the funding for the project has to come from the Union government only.  A long discussion was held on setting up a National Wildlife Disease centre. The officials from the ministry of forest and environment and climate change proposed to have this institute in Junagadh, however, the state officials wanted the centre to be in Gandhinagar. The Union MoEFCC secretary, R P Gupta, said that the focus areas for Project Lion were setting up a wildlife cell, a genetic and research centre, and a state of the art hospital for treatment of the lions. “We proposed to strengthen the habitat in Gir so that the lions do not go out of the sanctuary,” he said. He said that no Maldhari will be forcibly evacuated out of the sanctuary area. “Only those who want to be relocated will be shifted. In Gujarat, there is not much of the human-animal conflict as the people have been staying with the lions and want the lions in their vicinity,” said Gupta. State forest minister Ganpat Vasava said that Union minister Bhupendra Yadav was in the meeting and the entire project was discussed at length. The cost of the project is about Rs 1,000 crore. Vasava said that once the project is implemented it would give a boost to the lion conservation efforts. He said that the national centre for disease monitoring will not be only for lions, but for all wild animals. The minister said that the project even talks of developing Keshod airport, so that people coming from other states and wanting to see the lions can take use of the airport. The minister said that the project was approved by the Gujarat forest department and the final touches will now be given before it is sent for the final approval.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/want-100-funds-for-project-lion/articleshow/85911118.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

The probe will focus on corruption, irregularities committed and the financial transactions of the officials who are suspected to be having a role in the illegal tree felling case.

With inflows from upstream areas increasing with every spell of rain, residents fear that the overflowing nalas may inundate their homes very soon. Over 1,000 families residing in several colonies near Saroornagar lake are facing a fresh flood threat after a nala in Kodandaram Nagar started overflowing and gushing out into the neighbouring residential areas. A high alert has been issued by local volunteers, especially to those households in the low-lying areas. “We have shared the video of the overflowing nala with the residents, alerting them of a flood threat. The residents have been told to shift to safer places before it rains again,” said Kota Sai Kumar, a resident of P&T Colony, told TOI. The nala was spilling toxic froth which got accumulated near the retaining wall of the manholes that dot the area. Anant Maringanti, urban planner and executive director of Hyderabad Urban Labs, who recently inspected the nalas in the Old City, said dredging of nalas needed to be done on a war-footing. “Even after the illegal structures on the nalas are demolished, the width of the nalas remains the same. If the authorities do not fix that, how is it going to change anything,” he wondered. Yakutpura residents sense danger as the retaining wall of the nala is on the verge of collapse due to the heavy flow of water. On Friday, the authorities pressed into service an earthmover to ensure smooth flow of water in the nala. In Azampura, an overflowing nala inundated a railway bridge caused inconvenience to the commuter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/nalas-overflow-residents-face-flood-threat/articleshow/85913336.cms||Moulika.KV

On August 11, she sent her son to stay with Benoy’s relative. The next day, her son noticed that she was missing and informed Sindhu’s relatives. “We suspect that Benoy went underground after murdering her. He went missing on August 16.

Justice Mukta Gupta issued notice on Preet Singh’s bail application and directed police to file its status report. In his bail plea Singh, who was arrested last month, has claimed that he was “not involved in giving any inflammatory speech or raising any slogan against any person or community.” “The demand of establishing a Hindu nation in no way attracts Section 153A (hate speech) of Indian Penal Code and after the event was over, if any person uttered any objectionable statements, it cannot be the organiser’s responsibility,” the accused contended. On August 27, a sessions court had declined bail to Singh, arrested by Delhi Police in the case, saying right to assemble and freedom to air one’s thoughts are cherished under the Constitution, but these are not absolute and have to be exercised with inherent reasonable restrictions. The court, on the basis of the material placed on record and submissions put forth by the prosecution, observed that prima facie there had been active participation by the accused in his individual capacity and also as the main organiser of the event itself. The sessions court also noted that the event was conducted at Jantar Mantar in spite of denial of permission by Delhi Police and in total disregard to Covid protocol issued by the Union government. The matter will be heard next on September 15.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sloganeering-case-hc-seeks-police-reply-on-bail-plea/articleshow/85911197.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Lucknow||BJP’s 19 grassroots wings, 23 cells for mass contact drive||Lucknow: Stirring the political pot ahead of the high-stakes elections early next year, BJP has decided to mobilize 19 organisational departments and 23 cells to expedite the party’s mass contact drive. The two lateral wings of the party have been asked to organise conventions to mobilise people from various professions. The move comes close on heels of the party’s decision to organise statewide “prabuddha varg sammelans”, in an apparent bid to counter opposition’s bid to win over upper castes, ostensibly Brahmins who account for 13% of the voting population and have traditionally sided with the saffron outfit. Party sources said, the organisational cells and departments will work in close association with seven frontal organisations (morchas) which have completed their organisational set-up down to the district level and are now ready to hold their working committee to set the poll agenda to woo various communities including SC, ST, OBC, farmers, women, youth and the minorities. To begin with, BJP is scheduled to organise the working committee meeting of the women’s wing on September 6. This will be followed by the working committee of the farmer frontal wing proposed in Chitrakoot on September 11. The much-awaited working committee is expected to be attended by top BJP leaders, including party national vice-president and UP in charge Radha Mohan Singh, CM Yogi Adityanath, UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh and general secretary (organisation), Sunil Bansal. The farmers’ meet holds much significance against the backdrop of farmers’ stir against the BJP over the new farm laws, especially in the restive west UP region. The farmers’ organisations led by Sanyukt Kisan Morcha, has called a ‘mahapanchayat’ in Muzaffarnagar on September 5, in what has already alerted the ruling BJP. Experts said, the ruling party seeks to assuage the fractious farming community through various agriculture-oriented measures. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath had recently announced getting the state advisory price (SAP) for sugarcane raised, ahead of the forthcoming crushing season. UP BJP spokesperson, Hero Bajpai said, the party has completed constitution of the organisational structure of all its wings. “Activation of functionaries of different organisational morchas, departments and cells will help the party reach out to various sections of societies and professional groups to get them associated with the ideology and policies of the party,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjps-19-grassroots-wings-23-cells-for-mass-contact-drive/articleshow/85913402.cms||Pankaj Shah

The accused sent a link through which he asked the elderly man to download a remote access app on his mobile phone. He hacked his mobile phone, but after a glitch he asked the OTPs from the victim and siphoned off money from their accounts. Acting on the elderly man’s complaint, cyber-crime branch registered a case on charges of fraud against unidentified accused and started investigations. ASP Ankit Jaiswal said that complainant Jai Kishan Sharma, 70, a resident of Sagar Golden Colony in Katara Hills, told police that an unidentified man called on his wife’s mobile phone on September 1 around 10 am. He introduced himself as the executive of a telecom company. The accused lured the victim in his net stating that the KYC of her SIM card needs to be updated and sent a link to download an application. He took the code and hacked her mobile phone. However, due to a glitch he could not withdraw money through the app, so he asked her OTPs making various excuses and siphoned off Rs 1.99 lakh from her bank account. Subsequently, he disconnected the phone. Realising that they were duped, the elderly man approached cyber crime branch and filed a complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/elderly-couple-duped-of-rs-1-99-lakh-in-online-fraud/articleshow/85911207.cms||---

Though multiple complaints have been made by the residents and public representatives, no corrective steps have been taken to deal with the rain fury. Locals notified that several arterial roads are inundated, bringing the shortcomings of the storm-water drains in many localities to the fore.Yakutpura, Dabeerpura, Bahadurpura, Kishanbagh, Azampura, Moosaram Bagh, Nabeel Colony, Yakutpura, Chota Pul, Nawab Sahab Kuntta and Chowk were seen filled with water.  Old City people sought immediate actions and probe into the problems being faced by them after heavy rains, as they found no change in their sufferings even after several heavy rainfalls. “Case should be booked against GHMC authorities who ignored the sufferings of the residents. Open nalas, dug up roads and pathetic condition of the roads have exposed the apathy of the GHMC officials,’’sought TDP leader Mohammed Ahmed. The ongoing flyover work and pathetic state of the roads at Bahadurpura make matters worse for the motorists during rain. “It is completely chaotic as if people were left to suffer in the rain. The entire passage is filled with water and no one appears to regulate or lead people,’’ Nazim, one of the motorists, told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/open-nalas-bad-roads-add-to-public-woes/articleshow/85913382.cms||---

His family members alleged that he committed suicide as he along with other relatives were being harassed by police over the grenade blast which claimed the life of Ramesh and his two-year-old Inspector A R Patel of Shamlaji police said that Kanti, 25, had on Friday morning gone to relieve himself. After few minutes, his mother went to that place and found him hanging from a tree, said Patel. Meanwhile, family members and other relatives alleged that he was being harassed by cops in the name of investigation. Investigating officer of the case PSI Manish Vasava of Shamlaji police said that Kanti’s body was handed over to his family after conducting postmortem. He said the death was by hanging and said police did not harass Kanti or any other family members. The reason behind the suicide was not known to the cops. On August 28, Kanti’s elder brother Ramesh Faneja, 30, had died on the spot in a grenade explosion while three of his family members were injured. On August 29, Faneja's two-year-old daughter Sweety died during treatment, while his wife Sangita and another daughter Aayushi, 11, are still in hospital. Shamlaji police and special operations group (SOG) began investigating the case and found the blast was from a hand grenade which was given to Ramesh by an Army man from the same village. The grenade exploded when Faneja was trying to pull out its pin with kitchen pincers, said a police officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/after-mans-grenade-blast-death-his-brother-commits-suicide/articleshow/85911238.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||With no assurance of income, 5 of 6 teachers in Telangana remain absent||HYDERABAD: Even though schools have reopened, hardly 50,000 out of 3 lakh private teachers are said to have resumed their duties and many are said to be unwilling to come back to the teaching field as it is uncertain how long schools will continue to run physical classes. Teachers said that many don’t want to risk their lives again, which in turn has resulted in a severe shortage of teachers in many schools across the state. In fact, shortage of teachers is being cited as one of the main reasons why many schools, especially the budget ones, are yet to resume physical classes. “There is no way I can trust my previous employer (school management) and risk the well-being of my family,” said M Sanjeev Reddy, who worked as a mathematics teacher for high school students in CBSE schools since 1999. “Until the pandemic started, I never ever imagined quitting the teaching field. But, during the pandemic, we struggled even for basics. Left with no option, I turned into a tenant farmer and now I am able to feed my family,” he added. He said that despite receiving a call from the school management, he has decided not to join back as they failed to give him any assurance. Teachers said that they had already trusted managements once during the last academic year when schools reopened for a couple of months and had to shut down due to a surge in Covid-19 cases, but were later left in the lurch. They added that they can’t repeat the mistake again. “Management is not ready to give us any assurance. All they said was that they will be paying full salaries only if they manage to collect full fees from students. Until then, they offered to pay Rs4,000 per month,” said B Jyothi, who was working as an English teacher for primary students at a corporate school. Jyothi, who has over 17 years of experience as a teacher, said that currently she is running a bangle store and taking home tuitions. “I am able to earn about Rs10,000 to Rs12,000 per month. I can’t leave this and go back to teaching without any assurance,” she added. The managements, meanwhile, confirmed that there is a shortage of teachers and added that they need at least another 1.5 lakh teachers to run schools. “Right now, we will be able to manage as very few students are coming to schools. We are ready to recruit teachers and pay them salaries, but can’t give any advance or assurance as we don’t know for how long we can manage to run physical classes,” said Shekhar Rao Y, president, Telangana Recognised School Managements Association. He said that the managements are positive that they will get the required number of teachers as there are lakhs of unemployed youth in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/with-no-assurance-of-income-5-of-6-teachers-remain-absent/articleshow/85911220.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

At a review meeting with officials of education and health departments on Friday, chief secretary Somesh Kumar directed them to finish the inoculation drive in all schools and affix a seal of approval in such schools. According to officials, the immunisation push in schools is 85 per cent complete in the districts, but is less in Hyderabad due to the presence of more number of private schools. The CS also enquired about attendance in schools and asked the officials to instil confidence in the public and maintain sanitation in the schools. The CS directed the officials to get tests conducted for the children and staff exhibiting Covid-19 symptoms. The health department will place those who test positive in isolation centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/85-inoculation-done-in-schools-in-dists-officials/articleshow/85911270.cms||---

While addressing a press conference today held at the Uttaranchal Press Club in Dehradun, Arif Khan (an alumnus of the school) told TOI that he, at the behest of a friend, along with his former classmates, Maninder Sahi and Anoop Bhatt, reached his former school last month where they were taken by surprise when the present principal told them about the possibility of closure of school due to less number of children admitted. “After making a collective decision of conveying this regretful news to the rest of the alumni, we recorded a video of the school and shared it on social media groups which ultimately led to the video getting viral. On hearing this sad news, former students from all over the world expressed their dismay and decided to try their best to save the school from closing,” said Khan. He added that while thinking of ways to keep their school afloat, they decided to organise a 'Historic Teacher's Day'. To attend the event on Sunday, former students who passed out from the school between 1960 and 2020 will gather from all over the country “Former students from all over the world not only participated but also contributed donations to organise the event. The donation made by the former students will help the school in its finances and avoid a shut down,” said Khan. He added, “We will not only honour the serving and retired teachers but will also pay tribute to the deceased staff and their families. The General Manager and District Magistrate of Dehradun are invited as Chief Guests for the event which is scheduled to be held at the school. We believe that this initiative will not only help in saving the school from shutting down but will also increase the love and respect of the coming generation towards their school and teachers.” (By Aishwarya Joshi)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/alumni-donations-save-doon-based-school-from-shut-down/articleshow/85908719.cms||---

With D’Costa being granted bail, all the accused in the case are now out on bail. Earlier this month, the court discharged Vijay Karbotkar and Mahendra Tanawade. On February 16, D’Costa, Karbotkar and Tanawade along with Ricky Hornekar, Imran Bepari, Vipul Pattari, Harshvardhan Sawal and Sudhan DaCosta are alleged to have formed an unlawful assembly at Arlem Junction, Raia with the intent of murdering Shaikh over some previous enmity. The group, armed with a firearm, iron rods, koita and danda, are said to have assaulted Shaikh. The accused were arrested by the Fatorda police under provisions of the IPC and the Arms Act. D’Silva observed that the material on record indicates that the witnesses, whose statements are recorded, do not point out to the complicity of the accused in the crime and therefore, there does not exist reasonable ground, prima facie, for believing that the accused has been guilty of an offence punishable with imprisonment of life, although his involvement in the crime cannot be ruled out for lesser offences.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/last-accused-in-anwar-shaikh-murder-attempt-gets-bail/articleshow/85911286.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||Gurugram: Ambience Mall owner booked for Rs 289 crore fraud||NEW DELHI: A month after Enforcement Directorate arrested Raj Singh Gehlot, owner of Ambience Mall in Gurugram, on money laundering charges, Central Bureau of Investigation has booked him and two other directors of his firm for allegedly siphoning off Rs 289 crore from J&K Bank. Apart from Gehlot, CBI has also charged other directors of his firm, Aman Hospitality Pvt Ltd, and yet to be identified bank officials with conspiring to defraud the bank. According to the FIR, the Anti-Corruption Bureau has verified the allegations that officials of J&K Bank's Ansal Plaza branch in New Delhi had issued hundreds of crores of rupees in loans to Aman Hospitality. Later, with the connivance of bank officials, the loan was declared a non-performing asset to allegedly facilitate a one-time settlement. Aman Hospitality, officials said, had obtained a term loan of Rs 227 crore and Rs 15 crore as bank guarantee against the mortgage of a project plot of 20,000 square metres, which included building a five-star hotel in east Delhi’s Shahdara. J&K Bank officials allegedly connived with Gehlot and Aman Hospitality promoter-directors Dayanand Singh and Aman Gehlot, in the fraud. “J&K Bank illegally and with mala fide intentions settled the loan amount for Rs 128.9 crore against the outstanding amount of Rs 289.3 crore, even less than the principal amount of Rs 261.5 crore,” disclosed an official. During verification, it became clear that J&K Bank had executed a dubious deal that conferred huge pecuniary benefits to the promoters without taking recourse to appropriate proceedings under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002, causing a huge loss to the exchequer. “In furtherance of a well-knit conspiracy hatched by the promoter-directors of the company with the J&K Bank authorities, i.e. despite the one-time settlement which is illegal and to the disadvantage of the bank, the authorities failed to recover a single penny from the company till date and the settlement is a mere eye wash,” the FIR alleges. Last August, too, the Central Bureau of Investigation had conducted searches after filing an FIR on the direction of the Punjab and Haryana High Court after allegations that the company had built a mall illegally on 18.9 acres by blatantly flouting the building by-laws and other statutory provisions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/ambience-mall-owner-booked-for-rs-289cr-fraud/articleshow/85911294.cms||Raj Shekhar
---||Mumbai||Bombay HC asks ED to reply to Anil Deshmukh aide’s plea||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Friday asked the Central government through the ministry of finance and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to file an affidavit in response to a petition filed by Sanjeev Palande, the aide of former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh, for quashing of the case against him. Palande, arrested in a money laundering case, has petitioned the HC for quashing of the case lodged against him by the ED under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). Palande, 51, was working as Deshmukh’s personal secretary and was arrested on June 26 in the case by the ED. He is in judicial custody. Palande said the allegation of ED that he had a role in transfer of police officials has no weight as he said not the home department but the “the CM has control over the same on the recommendation of the Police Establishment Board.” His petition before the HC raises a challenge to the validity of the ED case as well as certain provisions of the PMLA Act too, as contended before the HC by his counsel Shekhar Jagtap. His case is that he has been arrested on a case based on “hearsay allegations made by a disgruntled” police officer Param Bir Singh. He has also questioned the “arbitrary and unjust” practice of not supplying the copy of the ECIR to him. He denied the ED case against him and said that for a PMLA case to be investigated, there needs to be ‘proceeds of crime.’ The PMLA case was registered by the ED on May 11 against Deshmukh, Palande and others. Palande’s petition said the Centre has failed to exercise its jurisdiction by including Section 19 (power to arrest) and 50 (powers of ED over summons, production of documents and to give evidence) in PMLA, both of which are unconstitutional, and sought directions to strike them down. The petition said the case is “politically motivated.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-asks-ed-to-reply-to-deshmukh-aides-plea/articleshow/85913422.cms||Swati Deshpande

Only those stations that are not in their own jurisdiction or in the buildings allotted to them will be shifted in view of the inconvenience faced by the people and under the reorganisation plan for the police.For instance, the Sadar police station is near Fountain Chowk, about 12 km away from its own jurisdiction, and the office of the ACP Industrial Area-A is in Sahnewal, but will now be shifted to Jamalpur police station.Commissioner of police Naunihal Singh said, “We are trying to get the police stations in their respective buildings and jurisdiction for the convenience of the residents. Like Sadar police station is far away from its own jurisdiction, so people get hassled to get a complaint lodged. Similarly, how would people know ACP Industrial Area-A is sitting in Sahnewal? I want every official to be present in their own jurisdiction so that they are available for the people.”“The office of ACP Industrial Area-A Simranjit Singh will be shifted to Jamalpur station. The Haibowal police station has also been asked to shift to the building of PAU station. That building was meant to be for Haibowal station, but it was given to the PAU station, which has been asked to look for some other building on lease or rent,” added the CP.The top cop said on Friday, he had a discussion on the issue with the officials and they have been asked to be prepared for it. “By next week, we will finalise everything and then shifting will start,” he said. Some police posts may be abolishedThe CP is also planning to abolish some police posts. He has already conveyed the message to the in-charges of the police posts, SHOs concerned and other senior officials. The changes are being made in the wake of staff crunch. Joint CP (headquarters) J Elanchezhian said, “This is under pipeline and final decision is yet to be taken.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/police-stations-to-be-in-their-jurisdictions-soon/articleshow/85908725.cms||Payal Dhawan

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Cooped up at home, anxiety plays the devil with kids||HYDERABAD: The pandemic has made daily life a tightrope walk for parents and children alike. With the signature of childhood — playing and running around — banished by Covid-19, parents who are already stressed, struggling to cope with their own changed lives are finding it difficult to handhold their children thrown into a vortex of emotions, with little or no outlet. Second-hand anxiety, sleeplessness and in a few instances even depression is slowly becoming part of some children’s daily lives. For 9-year-old Shweta (name changed on request), sleeplessness and anger are her new companions since the last one year. A trip to a psychologist revealed to her distressed parents that she was suffering from anxiety. While for another 8-year-old, a general disinterest in everything and switch in mood was triggered by high levels of stress within the family. Children between the ages of 8 and 13 have been affected most by the sudden shutdown of natural life. And how to keep children physically safe from Covid while keeping them mentally healthy has become an everyday challenge for families. With no sure-fire solution, experts suggest allowing children to meet and play in a controlled group could be one way out. “Initially the parents themselves were not clear how to cope. It was left to the child’s imagination and they started picking up the positives and negatives on what was happening around based on their ability. No parent sat down the kids and explained how things will be. The whole family dynamics changed, leading to high stress levels,” said Dr Bharat Reddy, consultant psychiatrist, Asha Hospital. Also, with a lot of families losing loved ones in the second wave, many developed a fear which also rubbed on the little ones. “Apart from taking away the single most important thing for children, which is going out and playing, the pandemic led to them being constantly exposed to fear and anxiety. The information coming into the house, the uncertainty, it all affected them too. Also, the whole environment has become very cold and impersonal for children. Otherwise, in a normal day at school, a child gets a lot of sensory inputs from teachers and friends. That feeling of warmth has been missing,” said Dr Vasuprada Kartic, counsellor and psychotherapist, who has seen around 10 such cases recently.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cooped-up-at-home-anxiety-plays-the-devil-with-kids/articleshow/85911244.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Renowned textile revivalist Suraiya Hasan Bose dies at 93||HYDERABAD: Suraiya Hasan Bose, who resurrected the heritage fabrics of Hyderabad and Telugu states, passed away in the city on Friday. She was 93. Suraiya Hasan had married Aurobindo Bose, nephew of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, who founded the Azad Hind Fauj. She is the niece of Abid Hasan Safrani, a close associate of Subhas Chandra Bose. Safrani, who hailed from Hyderabad, had coined the slogan ‘Jai Hind’ and rose to the rank of a major in the Azad Hind Fauj. Suraiya’s death brings to an end the glorious chapter of revival of rare and dying fabric weaving designs in post-Independent India. She was one of the last few surviving members of the Hyderabad nobility that had participated in the freedom struggle and was associated with Mahatma Gandhi despite the ban on the activities of the Indian National Congress in the princely state of Hyderabad. Her grandparents were the first to participate in the Swadeshi Movement when Mahatma Gandhi gave a call to boycott foreign goods in 1918. A huge collection of foreign goods was put on bonfire outside the house of her grandparents in Abids in Hyderabad much to the chagrin of the British residents and the Nizam. Her father Badrul Hasan was a great admirer of Mahatma Gandhi and one of the leading lights of Hyderabad Congress Committee, which was an independent body, as the activities of the Indian National Congress were not allowed in the princely state. Like her father, who had revived the dying art forms of Bidri, Suraiya had dedicated her entire life to the revival and popularisation of unique and rare fabric designs called Himru and Mushru. She also helped in the revival of Ikkat and Kalamkari, besides Gadwal and Uppada sarees. Suraiya was born in 1928 and was inspired by her father and uncle Abid Hasan. She worked with the Cottage Industries Emporium and later with the Handloom and Handicrafts Export Corporation. She had graduated from Cambridge University in textiles. “Suraiya had trained thousands of people in heritage fabric designing. Her sprawling handloom unit is a living testimony to how rare arts and crafts and fabric designs can be revived if one has the will to do so. Her death has created a major void in the world of heritage fabrics,” INTACH city convener P Anuradha Reddy told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/renowned-textile-revivalist-suraiya-hasan-dies-at-93/articleshow/85911292.cms||Syed Akbar
---||Lucknow||HC: Poet Munawwar Rana should do what his work is||Lucknow: Expressing that poet Munawwar Rana should do what his work is and not indulge in making comments on any community, a Lucknow bench of Allahabad high court has refused to grant stay on his arrest in connection with an FIR lodged against him for allegedly ‘promoting enmity between communities by comparing poet Valmiki with the Taliban’. A division bench of Justice Ramesh Sinha and Justice Saroj Yadav asked Rana’s lawyer, “Why do you (Rana) make such kind of remarks. Why don’t you (Rana) do what your work is?” The judges told Rana’s lawyer that no indulgence was required in the matter and he should file an anticipatory bail plea. Rana had challenged an FIR lodged by the vice-president of Samajik Sarokar Foundation, PL Bharti, on August 20 against him. He had also sought stay on his arrest. Bharti had lodged the FIR after Rana told a news channel that Valmiki became god after he wrote the Ramayana and before that he was a dacoit. “A person’s character can change. Similarly, Taliban, for now, are terrorists but people and characters change,” he had said. Bharti alleged in the FIR that Rana said that Taliban, too, would become Valmiki after 10 years. “This statement amounts to insult to Lord Valmiki and his followers. This is also insult of the Dalit community,” alleged Bharti. Rana’s lawyer tried to convince the bench that no offence was meant because it was his freedom of speech. Opposing the plea, additional government advocate SN Tilhari argued that freedom of speech had reasonable restriction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/hc-poet-munawwar-rana-should-do-what-his-work-is/articleshow/85913429.cms||Ravi Singh Sisodiya

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad universities take middle course, to resume classes in phased manner by October||HYDERABAD: Despite the state government orders allowing higher educational institutions to reopen for physical classes, many universities and independent institutions are not planning to reopen anytime soon. Many reputed universities and institutions such as the IIIT-H, IIT-H, ICFAI and University of Hyderabad (UoH) have decided to resume classes in a phased manner only by October. Most institutions are planning to stick to online teaching model or offer a hybrid model wherein online and offline classes will be held simultaneously. “Currently the semester is online. However, students who are interested in carrying out research and attending online classes by availing campus facilities are permitted to return to campus in a phased manner in batches,” said professor P Rajalakshmi, dean (students), IIT-H. As a pilot, a small post-graduate batch is on campus and has most of the classes in-person at IIIT-H besides 100 research scholars who are already on the campus. The institute is planning to bring back students in phases. “We have relatively large classes which will not be safe to conduct in-person. Hostels and messes are also places where safe distancing is difficult to practice if all students come. We require all eligible students to get vaccinated before coming back to the campus. They must get at least one dose and the second can be arranged here,” said professor PJ Narayanan, director, IIIT-H. The management at ICFAI is planning to reopen the university from October 4 for all undergraduate students and from October 18, 2021 for MBA fourth semester students. For PhD programme, classes will commence from next week onwards. “Initially, final semester classes for students of UG and PG programmes will be commenced with all precautions. All the students are supposed to get vaccinated before their arrival to the campus. It was decided to run the required number of buses with social distancing norms,” said Sudhakar Rao, director, branding, ICFAI Group, Hyderabad. UoH too is identifying students who are willing to come and are vaccinated for a staggered return to the campus from October. “Students will be called back to the university in a staggered manner from October15. Academic units have initiated the process of collating the students’ lists and securing undertakings to facilitate the return of students. Those returning to the campus have to be vaccinated and undergo atleast three days of isolation before resuming classwork,” said professor Kanchan Mallik, spokesperson, UoH.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/varsities-take-middle-course-to-resume-classes-in-phased-manner-by-october/articleshow/85911299.cms||Preeti Biswas

Almost 95% of her lungs were infected as the 35-year-old fought the battle against Covid-19, which even the doctors felt she was going to lose. But the Varachha resident defeated the odds and the coronavirus too as she was discharged from the New Civil Hospital (NCH) earlier this week. The battle was won thanks to her never say attitude, care of her sister and the medical staff of the NCH. Many in the medical field believe hers was the case of longest Covid-19 hospitalization. She is perhaps also the last Covid patient of the second wave too be discharged from NCH. The woman was taken to a private hospital by her family members on March 25. She had a fever and was feeling breathless. Cases of Covid-19 started rising during the same period in the city. “As her condition deteriorated she was put on a ventilator two days later and was shifted to ICU. She was brought to NCH on May 27 and even then she was on a ventilator,” said Ashvin Vasava, NCH doctor. After examining her at time of admission doctors at NCH told her relatives that chances of her survival were quite less. “Her husband and in-laws did not come to see her after she was admitted at NCH as they too were not hopeful of her recovery. Her sister and NCH staff were taking care of her,” said a medical staff member. Her condition deteriorated further. However, within one month of being admitted at NCH she started recovering and was shifted on normal oxygen from the ventilator. “It was the patience of the patient that she fought so well against the disease. No one can bear the pain of being on a ventilator for three months. It could be a case of reinfection but as per WHO guidelines even for two months patients can be found positive,” said Dr Vasava.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/woman-beats-ncov-after-5-mnth-battle/articleshow/85911132.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

---||Delhi||SC refuses to grant medical bail to Sajjan, says he cannot be treated as a super VIP||New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Friday refused to grant medical bail to Congress leader Sajjan Kumar after his condition was found to be stable and also rejected the plea to shift him to Medanta hospital for treatment saying that he cannot be treated as "super VIP." Perusing his medical report, a bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and M M Sundresh said that the politician was just having age related problem and his condition was stable and improving. Senior advocate Ranjit Kumar, appearing for Kumar, made a impassioned plea for his bail and told the bench that he had lost more than 18 kg weight in jail and he should be at least allowed to be treated at Medanta hospital at his own cost. “He should not die,” Ranjit Kumar contended. The bench, however, said that no one except God can give such a guarantee. As his lawyer continued to insist for shifting him to the Gurugram hospital, the bench said "he is not super VIP" and also objected over he filing bail plea repeatedly. “He is high-profile person but that does not mean that he should keep coming to court,” the bench said. “We are not inclined to issue a direction that he must be taken to Medanta-The Medicity alone to be treated by Dr. Randhir Sud but if the medical authorities attending to the appellant consider the necessity of any consultation with Dr. Randhir Sud or for any examination at Medanta-The Medicity, it is open for them to do the needful for the benefit of the patient. On examination of the matter, we are not inclined to grant either medical bail, as prayed for by senior counsel for the petitioner,” the court said in its order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sc-refuses-to-grant-medical-bail-to-sajjan-says-he-cannot-be-treated-as-a-super-vip/articleshow/85911350.cms||---

---||Mangaluru||Demo held for water desalination machine aboard vessel||Mangaluru: A Bengaluru-based company conducted a demonstration of a water desalination or purification system to be installed in deep-sea fishing boats on Friday. The demonstration was held before minister for fisheries, ports and inland transport S Angara and officials of the fisheries department, on a vessel. Jeffrey Sebastian, CEO Transicaa Ventures, appointed by Rainman, Australia, for potable water desalination machines, said the machine operates on the principle of reverse osmosis. The machine costs approximately Rs 6.3 lakh, for its electric version, and slightly higher for the petrol version. It can convert 140 litres of water per hour. With this, the fishermen will face no water shortage, and it will reduce the weight of the boat. It will save the fisherman nearly Rs 30,000 per month, which is used to purchase water to be carried on their vessel. The product is available in 67 countries, and can be used for disaster management too. It weighs around 50 kg, he said. Minister Angara said the machine is going to be beneficial for fishermen, and while venturing into the deep sea for 10-15 days for fishing, they will not face a water crisis. “We will discuss with the government on how to take this project forward, and support the fishermen with a subsidy,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/demo-held-for-water-desalination-machine-aboard-vessel/articleshow/85906910.cms||---

---||Patna||Bihar JD(U) MLA walks in undergarments on train to Delhi||PATNA: JD(U) MLA Narendra Kumar Neeraj alias Gopal Mandal landed in a fresh controversy after he was spotted in undergarments on the Patna-New Delhi Tejas Rajdhani Express on Thursday night. His video went viral on social media platforms on Friday. Mandal admitted that his stomach was upset during the journey and he had to rush to the washroom in his undergarments. A co-passenger, Prahlad Paswan with whom Mandal had an argument over his dress, has reportedly lodged a complaint with Delhi GRP against the MLA from Gopalpur in Bhagalpur district. Paswan has accused the MLA and his aides travelling with him of snatching his two gold rings and a chain for opposing Mandal’s misdemeanour. However, the MLA told the media in Delhi that Paswan was drunk. Sources said Mandal, along with his three associates, was on board the train from Patna to Delhi. When Mandal was rushing to the washroom in his undergarments, Paswan allegedly held his hand and questioned him for walking ‘half-naked’. “It is not proper to roam in undergarments when the coach has several women passengers,” Paswan told Mandal without knowing that he was an MLA. “He held my hand and disturbed me. But I rushed to the washroom,” Mandal said, adding, “Later, I went to that man and asked him about his identity. He said I am public. I removed his face mask and felt that he was drunk.” Mandal also claimed that there was no woman in the coach. The MLA, however, admitted that he abused the man during subsequent arguments. “When the rail protection force (RPF) personnel came and questioned us about the argument, I showed them my clothes and asked whether I was naked? I am 60-year-old. That man pushed me to which I responded by abusing him,” Mandal told mediapersons in Delhi while recounting the incident. The MLA always remains in news for his controversial remarks. On August 25, his party JD(U) had sought an explanation from Mandal for “accusing deputy chief minister and BJP leader Tarkishore Prasad of collecting extortion money from businessmen of Bhagalpur”. Mandal had also demanded Prasad’s resignation. Earlier, in March 2016, the then JD(U) state president Bashishtha Narain Singh had suspended Mandal from the party over his public statement that “main ab hatya ki rajniti hi karunga aur hatya karwaunga” (I will indulge in politics of murder and execute people). CM Nitish Kumar on Friday avoided a query by mediapersons on Mandal’s controversial behaviour on the train. However, JD(U) leader and building construction minister Ashok Choudhary said: “The party has so far not received the opinion of the MLA on the controversy. There is no written complaint against the MLA. We will comment on the incident only after getting Mandal’s version.” Choudhary, however, added that an MLA should behave properly at any public place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/jdu-mla-walks-in-undergarments-on-train/articleshow/85909173.cms||Madan Kumar
---||Goa||HC bails out murder accused after state examines just 3 prosecution witnesses in 7 years||Panaji: The high court of Bombay at Goa has granted bail to a man who allegedly murdered his wife with a ‘koyta’ (a sickle-like knife). The bail was granted considering the slow pace of the trial (that has been dragging for seven years), and the fact that the accused isn’t the father of the foetus in his wife’s womb. “The very fact that since 2014, only three witnesses are examined by the prosecution, itself is a big ground to release the applicant on bail,” said Justice M S Jawalkar in her order. The case relates to April 2014, when the man is alleged to have assaulted his wife, 27, with a koyta strike on the right side of her neck. This resulted in excessive bleeding, resulting in her death. He was charged under Section 302 of the IPC (murder), and a chargesheet was filed in August that year. Trial started on September 20, 2014. The accused told the court that he’s been in jail since 2014, for over seven years, and that only three prosecution witnesses have been examined so far. He said that no further evidence has been recorded since January 21 last year. His lawyer also told the bench that he was provoked by his wife, who allegedly had extra-marital relations. In her order, Justice Jawalkar said it was established that a statement by one person has made it clear that he was having relations with the deceased, and that the extra-marital affair was the cause of regular quarrels between the accused and the deceased. “The medical certificate suggests that the accused was also having injuries on his person, which suggests a fight between the accused and the deceased,” she said. The court also said that it has come to light that the accused is not the biological father of the fetus. The bench said that additional PP Sagar Dhargalkar didn’t dispute the fact that only three witnesses have been examined so far. He submitted that many material witnesses remained to be examined, and if the accused is released, there is every possibility of him threatening witnesses or tampering evidence. Advocate Arun Bras De Sa argued on behalf of the accused. “As such, considering the pace of the trial, it is not desirable for the court to leave the applicant languishing in jail. Certainly, it is against the mandate of the constitution, which bestows a right to speedy trial as a fundamental right,” the high court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/hc-bails-out-murder-accused-after-state-examines-just-3-prosecution-witnesses-in-7-years/articleshow/85911424.cms||---

The government asked principal secretaries and secretaries of excise, commercial taxes, mines and geology and transport to monitor reconciling of revenues into treasury. The government found that document writers misused technical glitches in Comprehensive Financial Management System (CFMS) to fake challans. According to the stamps and registration department, Rs 9 crore was misappropriated through fake challans and Rs 4.9 crore has been collected from scamsters. Five sub-registrars are under suspension for not verifying records. The stamps and registration department changed software in sub-registrar offices to synchronise bank challans information instantly. Sub-registrars have been given the facility of verifying the challans produced by public with actual remittance in banks. The chief minister’s office has directed all revenue earning departments including stamps and registration to put an end to malpractices. The CMO asked top officials to verify information received from departments with the finance department to ascertain the receipts. The government found that the delay in reflection of remittances in Comprehensive Financial Management System portal is giving scope for malpractices and directed officials to take immediate measures to upgrade software solutions used by the respective departments. The government has also asked the finance department to make CFMS fool-proof to avoid further irregularities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/govt-cautions-departments-over-remittances/articleshow/85911376.cms||Samdani MN

---||Lucknow||Electric Vehicle City to charge up Uttar Pradesh’s e-rickshaw manufacturing units||LUCKNOW: In yet another addition to the list of industrial development projects in the state, the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) has decided to provide 100 acre land to at least 50 e-rickshaw manufacturers. YEIDA officials said the project, Electric Vehicle City (EVC), would be developed in Sector 28, hardly 4km from the upcoming Jewar Airport in Greater Noida. Officials have sought details of manufacturers and the size of the land that each manufacturer would require. With the allotment of land to interested manufacturers, the units which are currently in Delhi, Haryana and Rajasthan will be shifted to one place. Manufacturers believe that once the units shift to UP, the facilities being provided in the state under the Electric Vehicle Policy would help in bringing down the cost of e-rickshaws. The Electric Vehicle Manufacturers’ Welfare Trust, which sought manufacturing units in Uttar Pradesh, said the land allotment was likely to be completed within two months. Talking to TOI, chairman of the Trust, Jai Bhagwan Goel, said since the UP government was providing better facilities as compared to other states, manufacturers were ready to shift their units to Uttar Pradesh. “Manufacturing units are not in one place. While some are in Delhi, others are in Haryana and Rajasthan. Similarly, ancillaries associated with e-rickshaw manufacturing are located at different places,” he said. “If manufacturing units and ancillaries are at one place, the cost of e-rickshaws will come down. Maximum demand for e-rickshaws is also in UP. The project will help vendors get e-rickshaws at a reasonable price,” Goel added. Owners of ancillaries units will also be allotted land as per their requirement. Talking to TOI, state industry minister Satish Mahana said a delegation of electric vehicle manufacturers had sought land to set up units. “The government is looking into other demands of the manufacturers. This is a turnaround in UP in the last five years that industrialists are coming to the state in search of land to set up units,” Mahana said.

The court was hearing a domestic violence case filed against Singh and his family members by his wife Shalini Talwar. Metropolitan magistrate Tania Singh allowed Talwar to go on September 5 along with her counsel and protection officers. “It is mutually decided that the petitioner shall visit her matrimonial home with two of her counsels and the workforce consisting of two people to handle her belongings. The entire process shall be videographed at the expense of the petitioner. List of all the belongings shall be prepared... Singh’s counsel shall also accompany him,” the judge said. The court further noted there was normal wear and tear in marriages, but both parties should tone down their expressions. After the judge held an in-chamber counselling of both for over an hour, the court noted, “As per the petitioner, she was thrown out (of her matrimonial home) on March 20, 2021. As per the reply (by Singh), she left on her own will on March 16, 2021.” The court directed Talwar to file details of her income-tax within 10 days of receiving her belongings.

---||Mumbai||Baby abducted & sold for Rs 3 lakh, rescued from Telangana in 24 hours||MUMBAI: The police acted swiftly to rescue a 10-month-old boy within 24 hours of him being kidnapped from the roadside near Bandra traffic police chowky on S V Road in Bandra (W) and sold for over Rs 3 lakh to a government staffer from Telangana. While three people were arrested from Mumbai, a police team flew to Telangana and apprehended Visirikaplya Dharmarao (50), an operator in the electricity board, and rescued the baby. On September 1, around 2am, roadside dweller Mumtaz Khan found her 10-month-old son Kaif missing. Worried she approached Bandra police. While filing the complaint, she told the police that a woman, along with a 13-year-old, had been visiting her daily since the last few days. Based on Khan’s description, a sketch of the woman was made and circulated among police stations and informers. “We got a tip-off that the sketch was that of Farhana Shaikh (33), who lives in the nearby Shastri Nagar. Locals told us that they had seen her carrying a toddler in the morning,” said an officer. Shaikh was picked up and during interrogation, she allegedly confessed to stealing the infant and and spilled the beans on her aides—Paramdham Gundeti (50) and Nakka Narasimha (35). Shaikh was arrested and a police team comprising Bandra senior inspector Manohar Dhanwade, assistant inspectors Sagar Nikam, Hemant Phad, sub-inspector Anandrao Kashid and the detection staff scanned through the CCTV footages from Mahim Causeway till Khar Danda and traced Gundeti and Narasimha. The duo told the police that Dharmarao had paid them Rs 3.2 lakh for the baby and at 9am, left for Telangana in a car in which he had come to Mumbai. Dharmarao was arrested just as he reached his Telangana residence with the baby late at night. Dharmarao told the police that he and his wife were childless since 15 years so hence he had approached Narasimha, who is from his village, to help him get a baby. “Narasimha got in touch with Gundeti, who lives in Khar Danda, who promised to arrange for a baby. Gundeti then roped in Shaikh to find a newborn,” said Kashid. After Shaikh befriended Khan, Narasimha asked Dharmarao to come to Mumbai. “Dharmarao paid Rs 1.5 lakh to Shaikh and Rs 1.7 to Narasimha and Gundeti when they handed him the baby boy,” said Kashid. “A probe is on to verify if the three accused are part of a child-selling racket,” said DCP (zone IX) Sangramsinh Nishandar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-baby-abducted-sold-for-rs-3l-rescued-from-tgana-in-24-hrs/articleshow/85913703.cms||Narayan Namboodiri
---||Kochi||Around 10,000 files pending in Fort Kochi RDO: Report||Kochi: Around 10,000 files are pending in the FortKochi revenue divisional office (RDO), states the report by a nine-member inquiry team. The team, constituted by the district administration following widespread complaints from the public about the delay in clearing applications, had submitted the report to the district collector last week. Following the report, the administration has decided to constitute an eight-member team, headed by the new sub-collector, to clear the files at the earliest after scrutiny. Sources said around 8,000 to 9,000 files regarding conversion of land are pending ever since Kerala Conservation of Paddy and Wetland Act 2008 came into force. Around 300 files related to Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act and 100 to 150 files related to building tax are also not cleared. “Huge pendency has come because of the number of applications under the wetland act and delay in getting clarification from the government regarding fee for conversion. Clarification on the February order came only in July. In the meantime, election was held and the second wave of Covid hit the state. That’s why pendency has become huge,” said district collector Jafar Malik. It is expected that it will take around six months to dispose of all these files. An adalat will also be held by October-end to clear the files. Administration will write to the government to increase the staff strength in Fort Kochi RDO, which witnesses huge applications from urban areas. Currently, 22 employees, including an office assistant, are working in the office. Of these, only eight are clerks and four of them have to attend to each taluk alone. Each clerk will have to attend 900 to 1,000 files. The RDO office needs more clerks to attend to the rising number of applications. “Once we get the applications, we need to get the report of agriculture and village officers. If their reports are favourable, site visits have to be done before issuing a final order. That did not happen because of the delay in clarification over fee. As the government said fees will not be charged for application filing after February 25, people who had applied earlier filed again and that’s why pendency has increased. Obviously, the delay will cause difficulties for applicants. We are planning to make a team and it will take three to six months to dispose of the files,” said the collector. Sources said pending files will be consolidated in each category before starting the scrutiny. Following the complaints from the public, the revenue minister had transferred all the officials to other offices. Though some applicants had complained hat some offices demanded bribes, no inquiry has started in that direction due to the absence of a written complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/around-10000-files-pending-in-fort-kochi-rdo-report/articleshow/85906714.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||NMC begins door-to-door vax in slums witnessing hesitancy||Nagpur: Probably first-of-its-kind in the state, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has started door-to-door Covid-19 vaccination of slum residents, many of whom have hesitancy towards the inoculation. The civic body has also set an ambitious target to vaccinate all eligible citizens by December-end. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B has directed NMC’s health department officials to come up with confidence-building ideas to inoculate people having vaccine hesitancy and reach out to those who are willing but unable to come up to the centres. NMC additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi told TOI, “Special vaccination drive is on for the last 2 days in six slums — Vishwas Nagar, Vijay Nagar, Gondpura in Bhandewadi, Rambagh, Siddheshwar Nagar and Kaikade Nagar. It will be extended to remaining areas with less vaccination. We have identified such localities through ‘Vaccination In Your Locality’ drive. We have also engaged two NGOs to identify areas where less vaccination has taken place. Target is to cover all these areas and ensure everyone is vaccinated as soon as possible.” As per the plan, devised by Joshi, chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar, assistant commissioner Prakash Warhade and zonal medical officer Dr Bhavana Sonkusre of Dharampeth zone, one team each has been set up for four urban primary health centres (UPHCs). Each team comprises a doctor, nurse, ASHA worker and NGO representative. The teams have started door-to-door visits to find out those who are yet to be vaccinated. They check all parameters like temperature, blood pressure etc and ask unvaccinated people to gather at one place in the lane. After all are vaccinated, the team moves to another lane. It is for the first time that the civic body has started inoculating people by visiting households. Earlier, after allowed by the state government, the NMC had inoculated around 400 bedridden people after taking consent from their treating doctors in the last one month. As per state’s public health department data, the city’s estimated population is 29 lakh. As per government numbers, 75% of the total population — 21.75 lakh — are above 18 years and eligible for vaccination. Based on census 2011, NMC estimates that 60% of the total population — 17.4 lakh — is eligible for vaccination. As per NMC’s data, 12,17,763 people have taken the first dose between January 16 and September 1. This comes to 42% of total population, 56% as per eligibility worked out by the government and 70% of what the NMC estimates. The demand for vaccine has increased manifold since the resumption of drive for 18-44 group on June 23. Over 30,000 people had taken the jab in a day, despite irregular supply from the government. The number of beneficiaries started to drop since the beginning of August. Vaccination declined to around 13,000 per day. As on date, the city has 184 vaccination centres — 160 facilitated by the NMC and 24 private hospitals. At an average of 300 beneficiaries per centre, around 55,200 people can take jab in a day in the city. District-wise performance is satisfactory as Nagpur stands fourth among 35 districts in the state after Mumbai, Pune and Thane. Nashik district, which has more population than Nagpur, is still lagging behind.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-begins-door-to-door-vax-in-slums-witnessing-hesitancy/articleshow/85911458.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

In the first meeting with the board of management of the university, Sisodia shared how DSU must build such an environment regarding sports that every person in the country will consider sports as a field of education. The board of management of the university has a total of 15 members. These include seven ex-officio and eight nominated members. “Our motive for starting this university is to give education status to sports. Our players work very hard to excel in their sports, but the efforts don’t get the same value as traditional education,” said Sisodia. “In DSU, the sports they play will be the students’ education.” The university will identify the players and work to hone their talent, the deputy CM added. “Today, the Olympics are dominated by China, America, Russia. Delhi Sports University will prepare players who bring medals for the country. There is a different enthusiasm about sports in the capital of most countries of the world. DSU will also work to create such an environment for sports in the national capital,” said Sisodia. While DSU vice-chancellor Karnam Malleswari said, “There is no shortage of sports talent in the country. A player needs just a little support to make their talent shine and win the medal. There is a lack of sports infrastructure and coaching in the country, but DSU will overcome these shortcomings and create world-class infrastructure.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sisodia-vision-to-host-olympics-before-2047/articleshow/85913635.cms||---

The water resources department (WRD) has constructed the footbridge at the Murmune village, which borders the Paikul village, using iron planks. Assistant engineer of Sattari WRD, Shailesh Pokle told TOI that strong iron planks have been laid on the embankment. “The bridge has been secured with iron pipes on both sides for safety,” he said. The government has announced that a new bridge will be constructed at the cost of Rs 12.5 crore. Sources said that a tender in this regard will be floated soon as the state cabinet has given its approval. On August 18, villagers from Melauli, Paikul, Dhada, Shel, Mainguinim and Murmune had threatened to block the highway at Guleli village if reconstruction of the Paikul bridge was not started within 15 days. After the Paikul bridge was washed away, the government had made a temporary road available through the Bondla Wildlife Sanctuary, but locals had found it inconvenient as not only was it a long route to the mainland, but also travelling on it at night was not possible. Sources said that the temporary footbridge was constructed on war footing on the instructions of the chief engineer Pramod Badami. Work was undertaken by assistant engineer Shailesh Pokle, junior engineers Aziz Shah and Pawan Warak, among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/temporary-footbridge-helps-connect-guleli-to-mainland/articleshow/85911535.cms||---

Janardhan Reddy found fault with the TRS government and irrigation officials for not presenting a strong case in favour of Telangana state in the Krishna River Management Board meeting (KRMB). “It looks like CM KCR is intentionally allowing AP state to divert the Krishna river water outside its basin which is against all the laws pertaining to river water sharing. The ongoing visit of CM KCR to Delhi is more for his personnel benefit than the interest of the state,” he alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kcr-allowing-krishna-water-diversion/articleshow/85914318.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

In April, officials filed a petition before the special court for trial of cases registered under the Tamil Nadu Protection of Interest of Depositors (in Financial Establishments) Act, 1997, requesting permission to serve the chargesheet in digital format. However, the defence counsel registered strong objection and demanded printed documents. Subsequently, the court dismissed the petition.When EOW officials sought Rs 1.25 crore to print five lakh pages of the chargesheet, the state government refused to sanction the amount. The officials sent a letter to the senior officials last May, seeking Rs 1.75 crore. The government refused again and instructed the officials to discuss with the public prosecutor to sort out the issue.“We plan to appeal before the HC to get an order to furnish the details in digital format to the 47 accused. The case has been pending for the last two-and-a-half years. Trial will continue once the issue is sorted out,” said an official.A Senthil Kumar, 45 and M Vivek, 34 had set up multilevel marketing portals such as Fine Futures India, Fine India Sales Private Limited, Best Way and Way2Success to cheat investors of Rs 189 crore, police say. They promised investors a monthly payment of Rs 850 for 60 months for an investment of Rs 10,000, which would be returned at the end of tenure. Agents were promised Rs 2,000 as commission for every investment of Rs 1 lakh.Senthil and Vivek were arrested from Chennai in March 2013 by EOW police. Vivek’s younger brother M Nithyanandan was arrested later and R Sathyalakshmi, an accountant of the firm, surrendered before the TNPID court in July 2014. EOW also arrested 43 agents of the firm.

---||Coimbatore||Extend Mettupalayam train service to Pollachi: Users||Coimbatore: While the ongoing flyover projects in Coimbatore city has increased travel time for people traveling from one part of the district to other, rail users sought the extension of Mettupalayam – Coimbatore passenger train up to Pollachi through Podanur railway station for a hassle-free travel experience. Hundreds of people from Pollachi town and Podanur travel towards Mettupalayam for work purposes. Rail users stated that no rail connectivity to these places forced people from Pollachi and Podanur to take buses to their destination which was times consuming. N Subramanian, the secretary of Podanur Train Users Association (PTUA) said, “One has to be prepared for at least two hours of road travel to reach Mettupalayam from Podanur for a distance of 50 km and an hour more for those travelling from Pollachi. Besides this, people also have to spend more money for their travel. Users further blamed the city corporation for not identifying alternative routes to control traffic.PTUA also wrote to the Union railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw seeking extension of Mettupalayam – Coimbatore passenger train till Pollachi with a stoppage at Podanur. President of PUTA Mohammed Zhaker said that the passenger train was plying till Podanur from Mettupalayam during 1960’s and 70’s when Podanur railway station was equally important as Coimbatore railway junction. “People living in the surrounding areas of Coimbatore city faced a lot of issues in reaching Coimbatore junction to board the train to Mettupalayam. If the passenger train is extended till Pollachi via Pondanur, it may receive overwhelming patronage which will add up to the income of the railway,” he said.Pollachi and Pondanur were part of the broad-gauge conversion of railway lines up to Dindigul through Palani, for which the work was completed in 2017. While the section also connects Coimbatore to southern districts, no trains were restored in this section.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/extend-mettupalayam-train-service-to-pollachi-users/articleshow/85911484.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Middle class worst-hit by NMP, says Mallikarjun Kharge||HYDERABAD: Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge on Friday said the National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) of Narendra Modi-led BJP government will not only snatch away the reservations of the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Backward Classes but also result in a hike in toll taxes, travel fares and power charges. “Monetisation of 400 railway stations and tracks for Rs1.5 lakh crore, 26,700 km of roads for Rs1.6 lakh crore, power transmission lines worth Rs45,200 crore, power generation plants worth Rs39,832 crore will badly impact the lower and middleclass sections of people as travel fare, power charges and toll tax are bound to multiply,” he said. On the other hand, the SCs, STs and BCs would lose their quota due to government’s decision to sell public sector undertakings including banks, railways and insurance. Terming the monetisation as a dangerous policy which has been packaged to look like a business model, he said the silence of the intellectuals on this selling spree will harm the nation both financially and socially. “The assets created over the years by the previous Congress governments will now go into the hands of private players. The BJP’s concept seems to be to indulge in ‘looto aur baato’ (loot and distribute)”, he alleged. “But the saffron party’s vicious campaign that the successive Congress governments have not done anything in the last 70 years stands exposed with the monetisation plan. The BJP government is now able sell the prestigious assets of national and international-repute only because the previous Congress governments created them,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kharge-middle-class-worst-hit-by-nmp/articleshow/85914325.cms||---

Tenants in the building, belonging to Cochin Oil merchants’ Association, have been served with notices demanding full rent or to vacate the building. “We have been able to pay only 50% of the agreed amount for the last few months as no business is happening for more than one-and-a half years in Fort Kochi due to the pandemic. Our business is solely dependent on tourism. But the association is demanding us to pay the whole arrear amount,” said a shopkeeper who received the notice. The notice calls for paying full arrear and renew the agreement. Otherwise, to vacate within a month time from the date of the letter. Another tenant said that the closure of shops for months turned out to be safe haven for termites leading to severe financial loss . “We told them our plight as we are finding it difficult to make both ends meet. Other owners in the Jew Town collect only half of the amount from tenants knowing the current situation. But the merchants’ association said they were concerned only about them and not others,” he said. Though TOI tried to contact the association secretary Paul Antony, but he was not available to comment despite repeated attempts. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/traders-at-jew-town-face-eviction-threat/articleshow/85906756.cms||---

Vakola police have traced and booked the cab driver. While a case was registered late on Thursday, the driver was questioned and released with a warning since the offence was bailable, said the police. #Watch: Civic-appointed cleanup marshal on mask-watch clinging onto a moving aggregator cab’s bonnet near Hans Bhug… https://t.co/ZQQQbl9rGj— TOI Mumbai (@TOIMumbai) 1630732779000The marshal, who was not injured in the incident, has been identified as Suresh Pawar (36). He said the incident took place on Wednesday.  Pawar, a resident of Hanuman Tekdi in Santacruz (East), said though he has worked as a marshal for two years now, never before has he encountered such an experience. “On Wednesday evening, I was on duty near Hans Bhugra signal in Santacruz when I spotted a woman in a cab without a face mask. When I asked her to pay a fine of Rs 200, she agreed to, but the cab driver began to argue. The woman was ready to pay the fine when the cab driver started driving away. I tried to repeatedly tell him to stop the car but he refused to do so,” said Pawar, adding when he tried to make the driver stop the car, the latter continued to drive and he clung onto the vehicle. Pawar said he was left a bit shaken by the manner in which the cab driver had behaved. Pawar was unable to stop the cab as it moved speedily ahead and he had to step aside. In the meanwhile, a biker who was watching the incident shot a video which has now gone viral on social media. Sudhir Chowdhury, area manager for cleanup marshals, said they are often criticized but no one looks at the “other side” when motorists act in such a manner. Kalina corporator Tulip Miranda said in ward committee meetings she has raised the issue of disallowing marshals on traffic signals. “In a bid to penalize those without face masks on traffic signals, they hold up vehicles. This leads to traffic congestion. Therefore, I suggested they be allowed only on internal roads so that traffic movement isn’t hampered,” Miranda said.

---||Lucknow||Flood hits 18 districts as 4 rivers flowing above danger mark in Uttar Pradesh||LUCKNOW: With four rivers flowing above the danger mark in the eastern Uttar Pradesh, the state government has pressed its relief agencies in full throttle. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath is on a two-day tour of six districts in the state to review the flood situation in the region. On Friday, he took an aerial review of Bahraich, Balrampur and Gonda and interacted with flood-affected people there. Relief commissioner Ranveer Prasad said that four rivers in the state – Ghagra, Rapti, Saryu and Sharda -- were flowing above the danger and that nearly 1,123 villages in 18 districts are affected by floods. While distributing relief material to the affected population on Friday, the CM said that the state government would pay Rs 4 lakh each to the families of those who died due to the floods. The amount will be paid to those who died due to drowning or attack by animals, he added. CM Yogi Adityanath shares a playful moment with a toddler as he distributes relief material to flood-hit citizens in Gonda on FridayHe further said farmers or sharecroppers losing life in inundation will get Rs five lakh each under the Farmers' Accidental Insurance scheme. An assistance of Rs 95,000 will be given for houses damaged in the spate, he said, adding homes swayed away in the flood waters are being repaired under the Chief Minister Awas Yojana. Stating that steps have been taken to ensure that no life is lost in the crisis, the relief commissioner said: “As many as 353 motorboats and 156 vehicles have been deployed in the search and rescue operations. The government has deployed around 5,811 boats and 1,001 medical teams while 1,131 flood relief camps, 1,321 flood posts and 1,200 animal relief camps have been set up.” "The government is committed to providing relief and protecting every citizen at this time of crisis. We have allocated an adequate amount of funds, deployed sufficient boats and teams of NDRF, SDRF and PAC to carry out relief operations,” the CM said after his inspection in Bahraich where the Ghaghra river was flowing above the danger mark on Friday has thrown life of people out of gear. After distributing ration kits to people in Gonda, the CM said: “Timely action by the way of channelizing rivers and dredging has paid dividends this year. The efforts have limited the extent of damage which can be gauged from the fact that a lesser area has been affected by floods this time.” He added that the public representatives in the affected districts have been asked to support the local administration in rescue and relief work. In Balrampur, he informed the locals that release of water in Nepal and excessive rain had led to flooding in parts of the state. He also advised people to stay alert against any kind of seasonal diseases as the floods leave behind a trail of infections. “In wake of this, the government has launched a special disease surveillance and prevention week starting September 5,” he said. Prasad added that more than 1,07,608 dry ration kits have been distributed by the government so far, while 4,445 kits were distributed in the past 24 hours. The state government has distributed 4,21,834 lunch packets to affected people of which 7,686 lunch packets were distributed since Thursday. “Over 66 teams, including those of the National Disaster Response Force, state disaster response force and PAC have been deployed in 42 districts. These teams are working round the clock to mitigate the impact of floods in affected villages. The government is also supplying drinking water, dry food packets, medicines, clothes, utensils and bedding to those who have been displaced due to the floods,” the spokesperson added.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: MCOCA slapped on 6 extortionists hounding SoBo||Mumbai: In a bid to curb the increasing menace of the Pandav Putra gang, the city crime branch on Friday invoked the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) against six arrested members. The police told the court, where they got custody of the six till September 9, that the gang led by Deepak Walekar had instilled terror by threatening businessmen and extorting them in the Khetwadi, Suttargalli and Bhuleshwar areas of south Mumbai. “They would not only grab properties, but extort money from builders, contractors and businessmen. All the accused are history-sheeters with more than three chargesheets against them for extortion, murder and attempt to murder. Their intention was pecuniary gain, a key ingredient of the MCOCA Act,” said a senior official. The anti-extortion cell of the crime branch had arrested Walekar, Ganesh Suryavanshi, Siddhart Mayekar, Anil Bhuvad, Sanjay Bhange and Jitendra Vaishnavikar last week. The gang members had been calling up a civil contractor from south Mumbai and asking him to shell out 30% of his profit or face bullets. The gang was also planning to kill a cricket bookie so that other scared bookies would succumb to their extortion demands. The police said Walekar wanted to make a quick buck in the absence of any other major gang in the city at present. Walekar, a habitual offender, has more than 26 serious offences, including murder, attempt to murder and extortion, against his name. Police officials said he had killed a hawker when he was just 14 in 1994. He was arrested under the Juvenile Justice Act and released within 10 days. He claimed to have killed the hawker because he had passed off a tip from his father to the Shetty gang. In 1994, the Shetty gang, then active in south Mumbai, killed Walekar’s father Pandurang Walekar over some property dispute. To avenge his father’s death, he joined the Tanya Kohli gang and has never looked back.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mcoca-slapped-on-6-extortionists-hounding-sobo/articleshow/85913717.cms||Ahmed Ali

The judge sought counters from the police authorities on the contentions raised. Appearing for the petitioner, senior counsel T Pradyumna Kumar Reddy said that IPC sections 306 read with 511 were added in one of the 31 FIRs booked against the petitioner’s husband. In this FIR booked in April this year, the police made an allegation that Teenmaar Mallanna demanded Rs 30 lakh from an astrologer and threatened him with bad publicity if he fails to pay this money. Now the police added IPC section 306 read with 511 on the ground that the astrologer’s wife made an unsuccessful attempt to kill herself. After this addition, Mallanna was arrested, produced before the court, and was remanded in jail. Taking an objection to the police action, Pradyumna said that IPC 306 cannot be sustained against Mallanna because there was no suicide in this case and hence the question of abetment to such non-existent suicide does not arise. Speaking about section 511 of IPC the senior counsel said that this is a residuary section that needs a crime. The judge sought counters from the state and the police and adjourned the case to September 14. Pradyumna said that IPC 306 cannot be sustained against Mallanna because there was no suicide in this case and hence the question of abetment to such non-existent suicide does not arise||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/explain-stand-on-petition-by-teenmar-mallannas-wife-hc/articleshow/85914332.cms||---

UP Police had been probing the abduction of the girl from Gorakhpur for the past two months. The arrested man belongs to Delhi. On July 7, a woman from Gorakhpur lodged a complaint with police alleging that around 12pm her minor daughter had been kidnapped. The mother raised suspicion on one Akash for kidnapping her daughter. After getting no response, the girl’s mother filed a Habeas Corpus writ petition before Supreme Court on Wednesday. Expressing unhappiness over the failure of UP Police in tracing the girl, the apex court directed Gorakhpur cops to hand over all the files to Delhi Police immediately. It listed the matter for hearing on Friday. The court also directed the Delhi Police commissioner to ensure that the missing girl was traced. DCP (South) Atul Thakur said, “The investigating officer from Malviya Nagar police station was handed over a copy of the case file on Thursday by Gorakhpur cops. During investigation, details of phone numbers used by the suspects, his family members and the victim were analysed. The families of the accused and the victim were also questioned to gather clues.” Based on the preliminary probe, a police team traced the location of the suspect in Kolkata. “The team left for Kolkata and with the help of technical surveillance, zeroed in on the suspect who had taken refuge at a house in Mollapara, Howrah. After a raid on Thursday, the man was arrested and the girl was rescued from his custody,” said Thakur. Delhi Police on Friday informed Supreme Court that the girl, who was untraceable for two months, had been found in Kolkata and the abductor had been arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/city-cops-rescue-abducted-minor-a-day-after-sc-shifts-probe-from-up/articleshow/85913730.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Commencing arguments over the framing of charges, special public prosecutor Prakash Suryavanshi submitted before special UAPA judge S R Navander that Dabholkar’s murder was part of a larger conspiracy to create terror in the society and, hence, it must be seen as an act of terrorism. “In an incident in which firearms are used to create terror in the minds of public at large or in a particular section of the society, for instance, members of the Andhashraddha Nirmoolan Samiti (the anti-superstition body headed by Dabholkar), then such an act is punishable under Section 16 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA),” he submitted. “The state home department has accorded sanction to the CBI to prosecute all the accused under Section 16 of the UAPA. The CBI has come out with a prima facie case to frame charges under the said section.” The prosecution had earlier furnished a revised draft of charges on behalf of CBI proposing charges under IPC sections 302 (murder), 120-B (conspiracy) and 34 (common intention), besides, section 16 (punishment for terrorism) under the UAPA and three sections of the Arms Act. Judge Navander heard Suryavanshi as well as defence lawyer Virendra Ichalkaranjikar before posting the matter for an order on September 7. Once the order is passed, the long-awaited trial in the murder case will commence. Opposing the draft charges, Ichalkaranjikar said the CBI in its first chargesheet had said Vinay Pawar and Sarang Akolkar were the shooters and eyewitnesses had identified them, but in its supplementary chargesheet named Sachin Andure and Sharad Kalaskar as shoot-ers. He argued that CBI holding two sets of shooters responsible for the murder and coming out with conflicting theories had no evidentiary value under the Evidence Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/dabholkar-murder-cbi-presses-for-terrorism-charge-against-5-accused-in-maharashtra/articleshow/85913775.cms||Asseem Shaikh

UP cane minister Suresh Rana on Friday demanded that Congress-ruled Punjab should declare how much is due on cane farmers in the state. “The UP government has paid 84% of the dues for 2020-21 season,” Rana told reporters. Reiterating the UP government’s stand of increasing cane prices for the upcoming crushing season from October, Rana said farmers welfare is top priority for the BJP government and it which would continue to work for them. “The government has always stood with the farmers,” he said. The minister said that sugarcane production has been increasing in UP, prompting the state government to bring farmers closer to technology. “Even the slip is reaching farmers directly on their mobile phone through SMS,” he said. He said that the state government had paid the outstanding sugarcane dues of Rs 10,661 crore of the previous governments. “In the past four years, the state government has paid Rs 1,42,311 crore to sugarcane farmers. There was no work done for farmers in the previous government. Earlier, either mills were closed or sold off at throwaway prices,” he said. “It was after the BJP came to power that a roadmap for revival of mills was charted out,” he said, underscoring how mills in west UP as well as east UP were revived.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/previous-govts-in-state-centre-did-nothing-for-farmers-rana/articleshow/85913752.cms||---

The party alleged that the ruling party cadres have also tried to create tension when their supporters were going to attend the programme. Despite due payment and repeated requests, the power supply was not restored and TSECL officials indirectly expressed their inability to do so, alleged local TMC leaders. TMC leader and West Bengal minister Bratya Basu on Friday said BJP cadres allegedly attacked TMC youth leaders in front of Udaipur College in Gomati district and left three injured during a programme held to welcome new entrants on Thursday. Two of the injured — Sumon Mia and Azad Sarkar — are serious and undergoing treatment at Agartala Government Medical College. Meanwhile, TMC leader Sushmita Dev told the media that her party has intensified its efforts to wean away Congress and BJP cadres to strengthen the base in Tripura. Earlier, they had forced hotels and travel agencies to stop providing services to the TMC and now, the BJP has stopped power supply, which is the biggest sign of nervousness of the ruling party, she said. Sushmita arrived here on a fortnight-long visit to the state to shape up the organisation and constitute the Tripura state committee of the Trinamool. After her arrival, she personally spoke to a number of BJP MLAs, dissident leaders of the ruling party and Congress leaders who have contacts of her father Santosh Mohan Dev, who had been elected twice in the 90s and made central minister from the state. Susmita issued a clarion call to all BJP, CPM and Congress workers and supporters to join the Trinamool so that the fight against the “anti-people activities of BJP government” can be intensified before the 2023 assembly poll. She also had held a meeting with BJP legislator Sudip Roy Barman. She alleged that the Congress high command has always neglected Tripura, using it as a bargaining counter to befriend the CPM at the national level, which had become the main turning point for the BJP to win the elections in 2018. “Biplab Kumar Deb must understand the people had voted against CPM and not for the BJP in the last assembly election and now people of Tripura have decided to oust this government, as it has cheated the people,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agartala/tmc-workers-attacked-power-cut-during-induction-meet-in-tripura/articleshow/85909046.cms||Biswendu Bhattacharjee
---||Ludhiana||Developers who did not pay dues can’t sell, buy properties||REGULARISATION OF COLONIESLudhiana: Taking a stringent measure against the developers who did not turn up for the payment of dues for regularisation of colonies, the municipal corporation has started sending letters to the revenue department for curbing sale and purchase of their properties. The officials claimed this action would force the developers to clear their dues otherwise their properties would be of no use. The civic body has to recover around Rs 13 crore from the defaulters and it has written against 27 of them in Zone D, while for the other zones the process is on. According to MC records, 172 applications were received for regularisation of colonies between the 2013 and 2018 policies, but only 31 were given sanction and NOC. The officials claimed they had sent many reminders to the developers to clear their dues, but most of them paid the initial amount and did not turn up for the rest of the payment and continued selling plots and construction work was also going on at full pace at their sites. Sources said despite the Punjab and Haryana high court imposing a ban on sale of plots in colonies that had not obtained NOC from the civic body or developing authority concerned, the plots were being registered. This is the reason why developers did not approach the civic officials for getting NOC by clearing their dues. In some of the illegal colonies, the number of houses is increasing, but there is no sign of basic amenities.Municipal town planner SS Bindra said, “We have to close the files of developers who did not turn up for full payment and we have also worked towards banning sale and purchase of their properties. We will request the revenue department to mention the pending amount in the land record of that particular developer (against land in the colony as well as his personal land) so that whenever he comes to take fard (revenue record) for a deal, he will have to first clear the dues.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/developers-who-did-not-pay-dues-cant-sell-buy-properties/articleshow/85909029.cms||---

Trial runs for line 7 (Aarey to Dahisar), which runs along Link Road and Western Express Highway, were flagged off by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on May 31. This week, MMRDA began trial runs on line 2A between Charkop and Dahisar. Both lines are expected to reduce vehicular congestion by 25%. Metropolitan commissioner SVR Srinivas said, “A team from the Research Design and Standards Organisation (RDSO, Lucknow; functions as technical adviser and consultant to the railways) will begin inspections next week. The commissioner of railway safety (CRS) can begin his inspection of line 7 in October.” MMRDA will begin commercial operations on both corridors with 10 trains, of which two have arrived. Metro 2A is 17.5 km long, and Metro 7 is 18.6 km long. MMRDA said nearly 80% of civil works for both lines have been completed and system works are “going on in full swing”. A senior MMRDA official said, “Work on staircases and escalators are still being carried out at some stations. Hence, there are still some months before commercial operations can begin.”  Initially, MMRDA had set a deadline of December 2019 to commence services but delays ensued, followed by the Covid outbreak. Labourers fled to their home states and work came to a standstill.  The indigenously-designed Metro cars will operate on 25 kV AC traction power and are to be equipped with CCTV surveillance systems, with a provision to allow passengers to carry bicycles. The cars, made of stainless steel, have a capacity to carry 2,280 passengers in six-car train sets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-metro-7-2a-operations-to-commence-from-jan-2022/articleshow/85913773.cms||Manthank Mehta

After the Thadou Students’ Association (TSA) rubbished the former Union minister’s remark and demanded a public apology from him, the Tangkhul Naga Long (TNL) , the apex body of the Tangkhul community, has also rejected Ramesh’s statement and termed it as “ misleading and far from truth”. “Manipur is getting TWICE the supply of urea it needs and yet farmers complain of shortage! Why? Because urea is diverted to hill areas in Manipur, where poppy is being grown for opium in large areas in last 4 years. The State Govt is fully complicit in this,” Ramesh had tweeted a few days back. Agriculture minister Oinam Lukhoi told the assembly that the fertilizer requirement of the state was actually 5,50,000 bags, of which they had received 4,40,000 bags from the Centre, leaving a gap of 1,10,000 bags. In a statement issued on September 2, the TNL said, “Very misleading and far from truth and it implies that hill people are lawless and are freely practicing illegal poppy plantation without any sense of abiding law of the land and that the state government is promoting such illegal activities.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/imphal/ramesh-urea-diversion-barb-irks-manipur-tribal-groups/articleshow/85909062.cms||K Sarojkumar Sharma

---||Nagpur||No polls till OBC reservation is granted: BJP||Nagpur: BJP party members protested at Samvidhan Chowk on Friday, calling for political OBC reservations to be implemented before any polls are held. Former state energy minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule said similar agitations are on across the state so that the demand is met at the earliest. Bawankule said, “OBC reservations had been given the green signal at the government level when Devendra Fadnavis was the chief minister. But it was some people close to Congress leaders who went to court and opposed it.” He recalled that after the change of government in 2019, an ordinance to the effect brought in by Fadnavis ultimately lapsed. “The ordinance has a life of six months and just before it was to expire, I met with minister Chaggan Bhujbal and requested him to fight for it. But this government did not follow up properly and ultimately it could not stand the legal scrutiny in Supreme Court,” said Bawankule. The senior BJP leader accused the state government of not showing any eagerness to collect data related to OBCs. “The Supreme Court has demanded empirical data on OBCs but the state is not ready to move ahead with it,” said Bawankule. He added that if the polls go ahead without OBC reservation, then MVA’s candidates must face the electoral consequences. “Their candidates will lose their deposits if polls go ahead. Our party members must ensure that OBC electorate gives a fitting reply to candidates whose parties oppose the reservation,” said Bawankule.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-polls-till-obc-reservation-is-granted-bjp/articleshow/85926521.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

---||Goa||Illegal sand mining taking place in govt’s own backyard: Petitioner to HC||Panaji: The high court of Bombay at Goa has directed that police personnel be placed at two government properties to ensure that illegal sand extraction stops. Advocate Norma Alvares, representing the Goa rivers sand protectors network told the court that illegal sand mining is perennially occurring on land owned by the government- in a property of the fisheries department at survey number 114/2 at Oxel Bhati in Siolim and below the Amona bridge, in property belonging to the PWD. “Until the next date, police personnel should be placed at the said two sites. If, between today and September 6 there is any activity in relation to illegal extraction of sand at the aforesaid sites, then the police inspectors of the police stations nearest to the two sites will have to be held prima facie responsible,” stated the division bench comprising Justices Mahesh Sonak and M S Jawalkar. Alvares said that complaints were received that several trucks with illegal sand have been moving out of the directorate of fisheries land in Siolim early morning. The gate of the PWD property is being opened and used for illegal mining, she said. Alvares told the court that the current modus operandi involves using suction pumps that suck sand directly from the river which is then transported by trucks. Alvares stated that as a result of this, the officer designated to look into complaints for North Goa has been forced to go to these areas in the middle of the night when such activities are taking place. She also said she has pictures of the trucks seen on the road early in the morning. Further, she pointed out that some letters were also addressed to the court registrar in relation to mining at these sites. The division bench asked the government why these properties couldn’t be secured and why CCTVs couldn’t be installed at these hot spots. Advocate general Devidas Pangam told the court that the petitioners didn’t raise any complaints of sand mining over the past few weeks and added that he would look into the matter. He told the court that the government is auctioning canoes and material seized from inspections held over the past few months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/illegal-sand-mining-taking-place-in-govts-own-backyard-petitioner-to-hc/articleshow/85911730.cms||---

In both cases, police have slapped the accused with various non-bailable sections. Authorities maintained the raids was the result of an input that inter-state gutka traders are using the national highway passing from Beed for transporting the banned product. Superintendent of police R Raja said, “The accused in one case was found using a godown near a college for storing gutka. We are now working towards finding the source from where the gutka was procured.” The officer said instructions have been given to check the criminal record of the accused so that stringent preventive action can be taken for being habitual offenders. An officer privy to the action said after we started cracking down against those involved in illegal businesses, it has been found that they have started shifting their base. The first raid was carried out in the limits of Kej police station where gutka worth Rs 17.46 lakh was seized from the godown — next to an educational institute in Kranti Nagar area.This was followed by the second raid in Dargah road area, also in the limits of Kej police station, and here gutka worth over Rs 7 lakh was seized.

Of these, it has approved 1,389 — that’s 63% of the total applications, shows data from the BMC. Last year, the BMC had approved 1,700 applications amid the first Ganeshotsav festival in the time of the Covid pandemic. This year, the number of applications is expected to cross last year’s figure, say community organisers of the festival. “People are a bit fed up of being kept indoors all along... Now, with many having taken the vaccination shots, more people are likely to join in the religious fervour with proper restrictions,” said Naresh Dahibavkar, president of Brihanmumbai Sarvajanik Ganeshostsav Samanvay Samiti, an umbrella organisation of community organisations. “Somehow, the overall fear factor of the virus seems lesser this year,” he said. However, the BMC has instructed that all Covid-appropriate behaviour be followed to pandals which have been given permission. This year, in all, 601 applications (27%) are in the processing stage as the approval from the traffic police or the local police station is awaited, officials said, adding that the process should be completed by the weekend depending on the response from the police authorities. The BMC has rejected 228 applications (10%) of the total received. Dahibavkar said they have requested the BMC to appoint a nodal official in each ward to process applications. “The ward officer is not present all day and often, permission to a mandal is held up as the final approval comes from him/her.” Those taking Ganpati idols at home will have to immerse them in artificial ponds created by BMC and mandals will be allowed to immerse idols in the sea. But no gathering will be allowed and limited people from mandals can join in for the immersion. The BMC has also asked mandals to not have more than five people inside pandals and appealed to organise online darshan. Also those inside the pandal will need to be fully vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-more-ganpati-pandals-may-get-nod-this-year-as-vax-gives-boost-to-faith/articleshow/85913805.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Delhi||Shock waves in construction industry over engineer murder||NEW DELHI: The murder of a project engineer working on behalf of NHAI by four persons, including the owner of a Gurugram-based construction company, has come as a shock to the consulting engineers, making them worried over giving “unbiased” views or opinions on infrastructure projects. The victim, Rajinder Kumar Chawla was working with Aecom, one of the world’s largest consultancy firms. Many are concerned that the incident will have an impact on the construction industry. This is the perhaps the first instance of the managing director of a construction company being arrested for killing an NHAI engineer supervising its project, though there have been instances of construction companies threatening and manhandling consulting engineers and getting physical, industry sources said. Jaipur Police on Friday arrested Karandeep Sheoran, head of E5 Infrastructure Pvt Ltd and four others. Sources in NHAI said E5 is a sister concern of Gawar Construction Ltd, which has emerged as a major player in recent years. “The government must take stern actions against the killers and others responsible for this. Independent consultants are government’s representatives and they protect public interest. They must get protection from the government so that they can continue performing their duties independently and in public interest,” said Raj Kumar, CMD of Rodic Consultants. K K Kapila, chairman of the business practices committee of the Consulting Engineers Association of India said contracting and consulting industry are two pillars. “This incident is shocking. We hope the investigation will be completed expeditiously and this is unacceptable to any industry,” he added. Chawla had started his career as an engineer in Haryana’s PWD and also worked in NHAI and NHIDCL on deputation for more than five years. After retirement, he joined the consultancy firm. The Gurugram-based engineer is survived by his wife and two children, who are settled abroad. The consultancy firm (Aecom) is likely to withdraw from the project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/shock-waves-in-construction-industry-over-engineer-murder/articleshow/85913799.cms||Dipak K Dash

The initiative would benefit 97,423 units — out of which about 62% of MSMEs are run by people from BC, SC, ST and minority communities, and about 42% of textile units are operated by women. While Rs 440 crore would go to MSMEs, Rs 684 crore is meant for textile and spinning mills. The chief minister said a total of Rs 2,086 crore has been spent on the MSME sector so far, which includes pending arrears of Rs 1,588 crore by the previous government. Justifying the freebies, Jagan said they were aimed at increasing the purchasing power of people to keep the state economy active. “The money given to people by the government through various schemes came back to the market and helped trade and business houses stay afloat during the Covid-19 crisis,” he said. He further said that nine fishing harbours are coming up at a cost of Rs 3,827 crore, besides three industrial corridors and three greenfield ports at Bhavanapadu, Machilipatnam and Ramayapatnam by 2024 at an approximate cost of Rs 13,000 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/rs-1124-crore-credited-to-msmes-and-textile-units-as-incentives/articleshow/85911704.cms||Gopi Dara

It was felt that those who had contested the recent Lok Sabha or state assembly elections should not be considered for nomination. The Constitution is clear on the category of people to be nominated on the council. We should adhere to it,” the minister said. NCP spokesperson and skill development minister Nawab Malik was non-committal on whether the MVA delegation, comprising chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, deputy CM Ajit Pawar and revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat, submitted a fresh list to Koshyari during their meeting on Wednesday. “I am not aware if the delegation submitted a revised list to the governor,” Malik said. Raj Bhavan sources declined to comment on the development. “The delegation did meet governor, but we are not aware if a letter was submitted to him saying some names should be changed,” a source said. According to reports, when the delegation called on Koshyari, it submitted that the cabinet is keen to drop the name of farmers’ leader Raju Shetti from the nominees’ list. Reports claimed that there was also objection to the name of former BJP leader Eknath Khadse, who recently joined NCP, on the grounds that he is facing an ED probe for his alleged involvement in the MIDC land deal. “We do not think that Koshyari will recommend Khadse’s name...as he is facing a probe,” the NCP leader said. When asked if the cabinet’s nod is required for submission of a fresh list is submitted, the minister said the cabinet had authorised the CM to take a decision on nominations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/guv-opposed-to-politicians-as-his-mlc-nominees-in-mumbai-ncp-min/articleshow/85913808.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

The MESTA had filed a petition challenging the state school education department’s government resolution dated August 12, asking all the private schools in the state of all the boards to reduce the fees for this academic year by 15%. The division bench of HC comprising Justice SV Gangapurwala and Justice RN Laddha, while issuing notices to the state’s school education department, ruled, “To the extent of fess to be charged, the respondents may not take coercive steps against the petitioner.’ The next date of hearing is scheduled on November 14. The division bench of the HC specifically made it clear that “However, the said order would not entitle the petitioner (MESTA) and its members to cancel the admission of the students, who could not pay arrears of fees nor should prevent them from appearing for examination.” The GR directed the schools that have already recovered cent per cent fees to either refund 15% fees to the parents or should adjust in next academic year’s fees.

Out of the 2,248 active Covid-19 cases reported from Dakshina Kannada as on September 2, the highest number of cases are from Mangaluru taluk. The taluk recorded 58.5% of the total cases, followed by Belthangady with 13.1% cases. Meanwhile, patients from other neighbouring districts also depend on the district for their medical needs. Hence, out of the total cases reported, nearly 4.3% are from other districts. Dr Ashok H, nodal officer for Covid-19, told TOI: “One of the reasons for the highest number of active cases in Mangaluru city can be attributed to a large number of educational institutions. So far, 802 students have been tested positive. In rural areas, our focus has been on villages reporting the highest number of cases. The district has recorded a good recovery rate of 96.5% and the positivity rate during the last seven days (till Thursday) has been 2%, he said. Meanwhile, the active case rate is below 10% in three taluks — Bantwal (9.7%), Puttur (7.7%) and Sullia (6.4%). 24% of Covid-19 cases in hospitals Of the total active cases, 544 patients (24.2%) are being treated in hospitals and 218 (9.7%) are in Covid Care centres. About 1,486, (66.1%) of the total cases are in home isolation. Dr Ashok said, “The moment the district began recording a rise in cases among the students, we made it mandatory for all the medical colleges to shift their students to their respective hospitals. This way, other than proper monitoring of the cases, it helped in curbing the spread of Covid-19 in the campus. But, this has contributed to a high rate of hospitalisation,” he said.

---||Kolkata||Slow start to admissions as most colleges report high UG vacancies||Kolkata: The deluge of undergraduate applications notwithstanding, only a small number of seats at a large number of colleges have so far been taken at the end of the first round of admissions, indicating that berths will start filling up only after top-scorers get into their preferred colleges to study the subjects they want to. Going by the trend and last year’s experience, multiple rounds of admissions have to be held before all the seats are filled. Presidency University and Jadavpur University are yet to publish their first merit lists but last year, even these two in-demand institutes had to carry out multiple rounds of admissions to fill their seats. This year, only some institutes, such as St Xavier’s, Ramakrishna Mission Vidyamandira and Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda Centenary College, Rahara, reported that just a few vacancies were left and that they would start online classes by the second week of this month. St Xavier’s College published its second list on Friday. “Most seats in most subjects are taken,” said principal Father Dominic Savio. Maulana Azad has published two merit lists and admissions from the third one is on. Yet, of the 50 seats in English, the college reported 41 vacancies. Microbiology has 30 seats but 22 are yet to be filled, while in accountancy, 55 out of 70 berths are vacant. “Those who scored very high applied to all colleges and their names feature on almost all merit lists across colleges. They will get into only one college, but seats held by them in other institutes will be blocked for now. But as we publish more lists, those on the lower rungs will get their turn,” said an official at the college. Scottish Church College has an intake capacity of 55 students in English. But a second list has been prepared with 45 names. The figures are similar for history, too. In chemistry, which has 50 seats, 41 students have been called for the second round. “Even after two lists, nobody has taken admission in computer science. This is a little concerning,” said principal Madhumanjari Mandal. At Bethune, zoology has 36 seats. After the first round of admission, a second list has been prepared with 31 names on it. Similarly, the college has called 31 students to take admission in chemistry, which has 38 berths. At Seth Anandaram Jaipuria College, too, admissions have been rather low. “We have just wrapped up the admission from the first merit list. Every year, the process starts slow, but seats get filled down a few lists,” said principal Asok Mukhopadhyay. But RKM Vidyamandira in Belur will publish a second list only if there is vacancy. “The induction programme and online classes will start by the second week of September,” said vice-principal Swami Mahaprajnananda. RKM Vivekananda Centenary College, Rahara, principal Swami Kamalasthananda said, “We are now admitting students from flood-prone areas, who did not have access to internet or smart devices.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/slow-start-to-admissions-as-most-colleges-report-high-ug-vacancies/articleshow/85911760.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Aurangabad||High number of NPAs, trying to help industries: Karad||Aurangabad: Union minister of state for finance Bhagwat Karad on Friday said they had observed a high proportion of non-performing assets (NPAs) under the Mudra scheme and were taking efforts to bridge the gap between the beneficiaries and the MSMEs, businesses and even malls in the state. Karad recently chaired a meeting of the state-level bankers committee. A report presented during the meeting showed that of the Rs 24,850 crore Mudra loan disbursed in Maharashtra, a total of Rs 5,521 crore have been defaulted. The banks have marked them as NPAs. The NPA under the scheme has been pegged at 22% of the total loan. Financial experts said that the frequent lockdowns have caused losses to many businesses in the past 18 months. This has fuelled the NPA percentage. Since the Covid-19 pandemic began, many industries and businesses were closed for long periods till recently, affecting their incomes and subsequently repayment of loans. Only now, the industries have opened to a large extent with the relaxation of norms. Moreover, the industries have been asked to get their staff vaccinated at the earliest. Even the genuine beneficiaries are finding it difficult to repay the loan instalments due to slowing down as well as losses incurred in the businesses, in recent times, they said. As per the data recorded till June this year, an amount of Rs 24,850 crore was disbursed to 41.50 lakh Mudra accounts. Of these, 6.34 lakh accounts have defaulted on payments and have been marked as NPAs. Karad told TOI, “The percentage of NPA is too high. To bring it down and improve the repayment by beneficiaries, we have decided to make efforts to bridge the gap between the beneficiaries and the MSMEs, businesses and even malls in the state.” While appealing to the industrial associations in the state to handhold the beneficiaries of the scheme by giving job or supply orders, he said that such steps will not only help people repay the loan amount but also help generate employment and contribute to country’s growth and development. Under the Mudra scheme, there are three different schemes having varying loan limit. There are a total of 30,71,898 accounts under ‘Shishu’ scheme, of which, 3,70,466 have been marked as NPA accounts. Out of 9,18,415 accounts under Kishor category, 2,36,871 accounts have been marked as NPA, while out of 1,60,677 Tarun category, 27,577 have been marked as NPA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/high-number-of-npas-trying-to-help-industries-karad/articleshow/85906968.cms||Mohammed Akhef

---||Nagpur||No going back, talks only on legal grounds: CP||Nagpur: Commissioner of police Amitesh Kumar, who completed one year in office in the city this week, stated on Friday that there was no question of going back on the issue of Ganga Jamuna red-light area closure under pressure, except for a negotiation based on legal considerations. Kumar said police are trying to find out an amicable solution to the issue within the legal framework. “Our discussions with all stakeholders are on and we would further intensify talks to reach an agreement,” he said adding that five more brothels in Ganga Jamuna would be sealed soon. “I decided to close down Ganga Jamuna’s brothels to ensure that the ‘cat and mouse’ game of raiding, arresting and again repeating the same exercise by the police ends and a viable concrete solution is found,” said the top cop, adding his earlier notification under Section 144 of Criminal Procedures Code (CrPC) was withdrawn. “Now, notification under Section 7(1) (b) of Immoral Trafficking (Prevention) Act remains, which would make prostitution within 200 metres of four schools, equal numbers of shrines, a police chowki and MSEDCL office illegal. Any customer arrested now may face imprisonment up to three months,” said the CP. Kumar also informed that Lakadganj police have turned the Ganga Jamuna chowki into a ‘madat kendra’ or help centre to provide assistance to any woman of the red-light area who approached the cops with a grievances. It would be addressed through the concerned government department, he said. “Prostitution per se is not illegal. A woman can have physical relationship at her own premises, but she cannot use it for commercial sex work, which is a business of brothels and hence illegal,” said Kumar. “The owners of the houses in Ganga Jamuna can use their premises for any legal business, not as brothel. Police did not ask a single residents to leave or vacate the place,” said Kumar, refuting the charge that police were acting under business lobby or political pressure. “Police will tolerate till it would become impossible not to react to maintain law and order,” said the CP, refusing to comment on the personal remarks against him made by some activists. On crime elsewhere in the city, the CP said stringent MPDA has been slapped on 40 goons and several gangs have been busted in last one year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-going-back-talks-only-on-legal-grounds-cp/articleshow/85911738.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Allahabad||HCBA Polls: HC suggests Barto find an amicable solution||Prayagraj: In a PIL seeking election of the Allahabad High Court Bar Association (HCBA), a division bench of Allahabad High Court has suggested concerned parties to sit together to have an amicable solution of the issue so that the Bar remains functional as one unit to work for the cause of Bar members in the best possible manner. Hearing a PIL filed by one Santosh Kumar Mishra, former joint secretary of HCBA and four other lawyers, who are members of HCBA, a division bench comprising Acting Chief Justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari and Justice AK Ojha fixed September 15 as the next date of hearing. Emphasizing the importance of the Bar Association, the court said, “The main object of the Bar Association otherwise is to work in the welfare and in the interest of Bar members and it can be fulfilled if Bar works as one entity.” In the public interest litigation (PIL), the petitioners’ contention was that the term of elected members of the Bar is one year and as per rules of the association, one month prior to the end of the term, an elders’ committee must be formed consisting of senior-most Bar members which ensures free and fair election. However, this year elections are yet to be conducted in spite of expiry of more than one year. After hearing concerned parties, the court observed, “The suggestion of the court to the parties is to sit together to resolve all the issues amicably has been accepted and accordingly, both the parties would nominate five members each so as to have a meeting to resolve the issues one by one.” “Taking into consideration the ground realities and the position pertaining to Covid-19 pandemic, they would take appropriate decisions in the fitness of the case keeping in mind the governing situation. In view of the acceptance of the suggestions of the court, we defer the hearing of this petition and order it to be listed again on 15th September, 2021 as fresh,” the court added. “The parties would be expected to sit together at appropriate time and are further expected to continue the meeting for resolution of the issues in the best possible manner so as to work ultimately in the interest of the Bar,” the court lastly added. The court passed these directives on September 1 that came to limelight on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hcba-polls-hc-suggests-barto-find-an-amicable-solution/articleshow/85909204.cms||---

The third offence of cheating was registered against the Chennai-based firm’s directors and representative on Friday in Latur district. The earlier offences were registered in Nanded and Latur districts.The Latur police have arrested accused Abhijit Deshmukh hailing from Ahmednagar district, who is said to be the representative of the firm. He is currently in five days of police custody. Latur superintendent of police Nikhil Pingale told TOI, “In the latest incident, the suspects using the common modus operandi of assuring the sugar mills of selling the export quota sugar in international market, purchased several metric tonnes of sugar and sold it in the local market.” Due to their alleged act, the third sugar mill has incurred a loss to the tune of over Rs2.5 crore as it was compelled to pay full the GST. As per the central government norms, every sugar factory has to pay 0.1 per cent GST if the sugar export targets are met. The documents of selling the produce in international market are to be filed within 90 days of selling the export quota sugar. Failing to file the documents within the stipulated time is assumed as company failed to meet export target and is compelled to pay 4.99 per cent GST. In case of the Nanded-based sugar mill, the accused had purchased 5,682 metric tonnes of sugar. In the offence registered on Thursday in Latur, the suspects purchased 8,364 metric tonnes of export quota sugar. In the offence registered on Friday, also in Latur, the accused purchased over 2,000 metric tonnes of export quota sugar. The police investigation revealed that the sugar was purchased by the Chennai-based private limited firm in the past one year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/third-case-against-chennai-firm-for-duping-sugar-mill/articleshow/85906976.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Goa||Calangute teen death: Cops seek Goa Medical College opinion on autopsy report||PANAJI/CALANGUTE: Calangute police on Friday wrote to Goa Medical College (GMC) asking it to constitute a panel of doctors to give an expert opinion on the postmortem report of the 19-year-old woman who was found dead on Calangute beach last month, reports Murari Shetye. The teen’s father had raised doubts on the postmortem report. “We have sought expert opinion on the queries raised by the father,” said Calangute PI Nolasco Raposo, who confirmed to TOI that the letter has been addressed to the GMC dean. Twenty days after his daughter was found dead, the father on Wednesday filed a police complaint claiming that his daughter was murdered by unknown persons who forcibly drowned her. In the complaint, the father cited the postmortem report which, he said, indicates that the body was lying on its back with her face up, whereas in the photos of the body, the deceased woman is seen lying face down, which shows somebody changed the position of the body. The father also said that the postmortem report states that the stomach was empty. “This means my daughter was not drowned in deep sea water. Otherwise, she would have had water in her stomach. On the other hand, there was sand in her vocal chords, which means she drowned in seawater on the beach,” he said in his complaint. The father also cited the presence of some injuries on the body. “Since they are not deep bruises, they are not caused by hard objects, ...they are possible if someone forcibly holds other people tight with their hands,” he said. Police, on reaching the “final stage” of the investigation, had said that they have not found “any evidence to indicate foul play”. A senior officer had said that they investigated all angles brought to their notice by the deceased woman’s family. “After investigating (all) the angles, we have found no evidence to indicate foul play in the case,” he said. Police said that investigation is on and that they are probing other angles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/calangute-teen-death-cops-seek-gmc-opinion-on-autopsy-report/articleshow/85911820.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Osmanabad: Key accused in loan against sugar scam arrested||Aurangabad: The economic offences wing (EOW) of Osmanabad district police — probing the loan against sugar scam worth Rs 27.63 crore — has arrested a key official of the Vaidyanath Urban Cooperative Bank, headquartered at Parli in Beed district. The arrested accused, identified as Nitin Chitale — who is the assistant chief executive officer of the cooperative bank — was produced before Kalamb-based court on Friday. He has been remanded in police custody for five days. Osmananabad superintendent of police Raj Tilak Roushan told TOI, “Osmanabad district’s Kalamb based Shambhu Mahadev sugar mill obtained multiple loans from Vaijanath Cooperative Bank, Beed, between 2002 and 2017. For each loan, sugar produced by this mill was mortgaged. However, the mortgaged sugar bags were siphoned off and later the loan has also defaulted.” A total of 1,54,177 quintal of sugar, which was mortgaged to the bank and kept in a sealed godown, was missing. Authorities said this is the third arrest made in the case, that was registered against eight accused on March 12 this year at Kalamb police station. The offence of cheating, criminal breach of trust and criminal conspiracy was registered based on the complaint lodged by Subhash Nirmal, who is one of the members of the bank. Investigation officer and EOW inspector Santosh Shejal said Chitale is the third accused to be arrested. The two other accused arrested earlier, remained in jail for about 45 days before they were recently released on conditional bail. “The sugar was allegedly siphoned off between July 2017 and January 2018 from the sealed godown of the bank. The audit revealed that 57, 000 quintal of sugar mortgaged in 2014-15 and 57, 177 quintal of sugar mortgaged in 2013-14 were siphoned off,” said Shejal. The accused named in the FIR would show already mortgaged sugar and obtain a fresh loan from the bank, he said. All the alleged ill doings came to light only after the sugar factory defaulted on the loan amount, following which an internal inquiry was carried out by the bank and based on the findings, the bank’s member lodged a police complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/osmanabad-key-accused-in-loan-against-sugar-scam-arrested/articleshow/85906983.cms||Mohammed Akhef

Now, only 138 engineering seats remain to be filled after the second round, while over 450 seats stayed vacant even after the third round of counselling last year. But both JU and CU officials said they would wait till the mop-up rounds for the final admission figures as counselling for the IITs and NITs had not started yet. This year, counselling for engineering seats by the state JEE board started on August 13. In JU, after second round of counselling, 1,133 seats out of 1,247 have been taken. The bulk of the admissions were taken after the second round as only 248 seats had been filled after the first round. JU pro vice-chancellor Chiranjib Bhattacharjee said, “This year, the admission trends are better than that in previous years. It gives us the satisfaction that many students are choosing Jadavpur University for its academic excellence, research, innovation and placement opportunities. But we also feel a few percentage of the students might leave once counselling at the IITs and NITs begin.” At JU, the engineering faculty offers 16 subjects. At CU, which has only 250 seats in engineering, 220 were filled after the second round of admission. CU offers eight engineering programmes. Officials said they were witnessing a demand for computer science and engineering, electronics and communication and information technology. A CU official said, “This year, a student who ranked 290 in WBJEE has applied in CU. Last year, those with WBJEE rank of 1,700 to 8,000 applied here.” But another CU official pointed out, “This is the first counselling this pandemic year. So none wants to take a risk and is seeking admission in whatever they get. There is a high chance of migration later.” Taranjit Singh, president of Association of Professional Academic Institutions (APAI), said, “Private engineering colleges are getting good number of students. Their counselling has started. We hope the migration rate will be low this time. We will get a clear idea only after the mop-up round gets over.” Echoing him, a JU official said, “A clearer picture will emerge only after the mop-up round.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/engg-seats-at-ju-cu-taken-faster-than-last-year/articleshow/85911807.cms||---
---||Allahabad||Allahabad University dissolves cultural committee withing 8 months of its existence||PRAYAGRAJ: Days after being forced to cancel a poetic symposium on the campus on August 13, the cultural committee of Allahabad University has now been dissolved on the orders of VC Prof Sangita Srivastava through a notification issued by AU registrar Prof NK Shukla. The symposium had attracted controversy when it came to light that some poets who had been part of the anti-CAA protests at Shaheenbagh in New Delhi had also been invited to the symposium. An all-India Mushaira and Kavi Sammelan was supposed to be organised on AU campus on August 13 under the joint aegis of Uttar Pradesh Urdu Academy, central cultural committee of AU and department of Urdu, AU. Prof Shabnam Hamid, head of the department, and Prof Santosh Bhadauria, chairman of the central cultural committee were actively involved in the preparations of the event. However, the mushaira was cancelled at the last moment, despite the fact that almost all the invited poets had arrived and so had the guests. Divisional commissioner Sanjay Goyal, who had earlier given his approval to come as the chief guest, and AU vice chancellor, who was to preside over the function, refused to come. Although the university authorities were tight-lipped about the reason behind the last moment withdrawal of the chief guest and the VC from the event, sources informed that it was because names of some Urdu poets were among the invitees who had raised their voice against CAA and Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the Shaheen Bagh protest in Delhi last year. When this issue went viral on social media, the two had refused to attend the event and the same was cancelled. Now, AU’s central cultural committee, which was constituted on December last year, has been dissolved with immediate effect. On being asked as to why the committee has been dissolved within eight months of its existence, AU public relation officer (PRO) Jaya Kapoor said, “The AU administration had decided that there is a need for a new cultural committee. Hence, the existing committee is being dissolved so that the new committee can take over”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/au-dissolves-cultural-committee-withing-8-months-of-its-existence/articleshow/85909240.cms||---
---||Delhi||South Delhi civic body has no space for strays caught in drives||NEW DELHI: South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) is having a tough time finding space for stray animals caught after special drives. The officials said that at least 192 strays were rounded up in the last 11 days, but they need to make a lot of effort and chase the issue with senior Delhi government officials to find space in their gaushalas as NGOs refused to facilitate them. As of now, there are five gaushalas in Delhi, looked after by the NGOs and supported by Delhi government. Stray cattle collected from different parts of cities are sent there by the north, south and east corporations. “Of them, two are assigned to SDMC, but both are non-operational as of now. One is at Gumanhera that has been shut for four years. Despite our request to the Delhi government, no new licence has been issued. The second one is at Najafgarh and is also non-operation for mismanagement for the past eight months. The two gaushalas falling under the jurisdiction of north corporation are also full and have no scope for taking more cattle,” said an official from the veterinary department. The department raised the matter in the SDMC standing committee meeting and claimed to write to the director, animal husbandry, Delhi government. TOI didn’t get any comment from the Delhi government on this issue. “Since we plan to catch stray cattle to avoid inconvenience to the general public at regular intervals, the committee will also follow up with the Delhi government to arrange more space and make all gaushalas operational,” said standing committee chairman Col. BK Oberoi. A senior official from the east corporation’s veterinary department, however, claimed that they have received a letter from the animal husbandry department stating that disciplinary action would be taken against the NGO, if they refuse to accept stray cattle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sdmc-has-no-space-for-strays-caught-in-drives/articleshow/85913849.cms||---

---||Goa||August was among Goa’s driest in four decades||PANAJI: In a sequence of extremes — too heavy in a short period and much less in a longer one — rainfall in August ended as one of the poorest in four decades after an awesome 14-day spell produced the state’s worst flood in 40 years. On August 31, the India meteorological department (IMD) recorded 361mm — only 51% rainfall — in the month with prolonged weak monsoon activity, as compared to the average of 702.3m. “Based on available data, the deficit in August rainfall this year was 49%,” scientist, IMD-Panaji, Rahul M said. The rainfall in July 2021 had showed a sharp contrast with 14 days producing a bumper rainfall of 1,047.3mm that left many parts of Goa floating and people, especially farmers, in tears. The rest of the 17 days of July witnessed only 233.5mm of rainfall, partly in a sparse spell that lasted till the end of August. “The peak monsoon month of August was very bad for the country as a whole with a 24% deficit. The country had a deficit of 9% from June 1 till August 31, with only the South Peninsular India showing an 8% excess while the rest of the three regions were showing a deficit,” meteorologist M R Ramesh Kumar said. But the August rainfall is not poorer compared to other past records, the IMD scientist said. “At least on four occasions — 281mm in 1999 and also in 1971, 1972, 1978 and 2009 — rainfall recorded in August was less than August 2021,” Rahul said. On Tuesday, the seasonal total had crawled to 2,656mm, as compared to the average of 2,712.8mm — an overall deficit of only 2% — camouflaging the long gaps of weak monsoon activity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/aug-was-among-goas-driest-in-four-decades/articleshow/85911830.cms||Paul Fernandes

Shop owners have been complaining that they didn’t get adequate business due to the pandemic last year, and hence they had requested the chairperson to allow them to sell matoli items inside the market this year. “We will permit only a limited number of stalls, and we intend to allow vendors to sell items at the space near the Shakuntala statue and adhere to SOPs like social distancing and wearing face masks,” Vaigankar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mapusa-municipality-will-decide-on-matoli-market-soon-council-chief/articleshow/85911871.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Goa||Harilal Menon first Goa University academic to become its vice-chancellor||PANAJI: Governor and Goa University chancellor PS Sreedharan Pillai on Friday appointed Harilal B Menon as the varsity’s vice-chancellor. Menon, who is set to take charge immediately, will be the first full-time academic from within the university to be its VC. Menon, who served as dean of the school of earth, ocean and atmospheric sciences at GU, will have a term of five years. More than 260 persons had applied for the post of vice-chancellor after Varun Sahni’s term ended last month. Sahni had also served as a reader at GU before being selected as vice-chancellor, but Menon has served Goa University full-time since joining the varsity in November 1988. He was from among the earliest batches to be recruited to Goa University, when the varsity was still finding its feet. Born in 1962, the new VC has worked on many projects as investigator or co-investigator, funded by agencies like ISRO. In 1984, he received a fellowship from the CSIR. Menon’s areas of specialisation are optical remote sensing of coastal and estuarine waters, and aerosol science. He has a doctorate from Cochin University of Science and Technology and did his post-doc work at the Max-Plank institute of meteorology and institute of oceanography. He has numerous research publications to his name. Menon is among the senior-most faculty members at GU. After Sahni’s term ended, the chancellor had appointed a three-member committee with CSIR director general Shekhar Mande, former NCERT director Jagmohan Singh Rajput and DRDO’s G Satish Reddy as its members. Of the over 260 applicants, 23 were shortlisted, and an interview was conducted with them on August 25.

The truck driver had failed to negotiate a sharp curve along the ghat section. He died on the spot and the helper was critically injured. It could have been fatal for the four railway gangmen had the vehicle fallen on the restroom, where they were sleeping, along the Igatpuri-Mumbai train tracks after breaking the side walls of the highway in the absence of any crash barrier. Motorists using the highway rue that the condition of the 10km stretch of the highway’s ghat section, from Latifwadi to Pimpri Phata, turns pitiable every monsoon and accidents are a frequent affair. Dhule resident Mohammad Rafique, who has to travel Bhiwandi on the Agra-Mumbai national highway on a two-wheeler for his business, said, “The one-side trip time is usually around 5 hours on two-wheeler. But once the monsoon arrives, it takes three more hours to reach Dhule. I have to be extra vigilant while negotiating the ghat section of the highway at Igatpuri. The stretch is a nightmare.” A visit to the ghat section by team TOI revealed that the parts of the road have worn out and potholes mark many parts of the stretch. Stone gravel is strewn all over the road. And when it rains, some parts of the road look like marshy land with slush making the road all the more dangerous. What is more agonising is the absence of crash barriers in some parts of the highway stretch. The additional director general of the Maharashtra Highway Police, Bhushan Kumar Upadhyay, admitted that the road in that ghat section was not in a good shape. “The Nashik division of the highway police division has got in touch with the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) about the measures to be taken,” Upadhyay said. Nashik highway police officers said during monsoon, the ghat section would be treacherous for vehicles. On an average, the section witnesses three serious accidents in a month and about 15 instances of heavy vehicles breaking down. “We have been writing to the NHAI on the need to have crash barriers and oundary walls,” said a highway police officer. Retired defence officer Vijay Manchanda, who has been travelling between Mumbai to Nashik for the past 15 years, said, “The condition of the road during monsoon is deplorable and is deteriorating every year, though we pay a toll. It is imperative for the NHAI to ensure proper upkeep of its roads.” Bhim Singh, a truck driver from Uttar Pradesh, Bhim Singh, said, “The tyres of the vehicles get damaged because of the poor road condition. Besides, the rims of the tyres get twisted too.” Abhay Kulkarni, chairman of NGO Nashik First, said, “I am apprehensive that the NHAI is not paying proper attention to roads maintenance. The agency should make the contractors accountable for the road work.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/mumbai-agra-highway-ghat-stretch-a-motorists-nightmare/articleshow/85907086.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

The villagers and elected representatives are opposing the move and instead are demanding to convert the village panchayats into town council for planning and development. The merger proposal — pending with the urban development department — has also sought inclusion of industrial zones as well to increase the revenue of the KMC through various taxes. On Thursday, the sitting and former public representatives from rural constituencies met minister Eknath Shinde with a proposal to drop the name of big villages from the merger plan. Sujit Minchekar, former MLA of Hatkanangale constituency, demanded to drop the names of industrial and semi-industrial localities in Shiroli and Nagaon. “The proposal for converting the rapidly urbanised and industrialised villages into municipal towns or town councils for better management is pending for a long time. No one from these villages are ready to get merged into KMC limits owing to various issues especially taxes and apathy towards development,” he said. The KMC officials and activists from city claim that with increase in size and population, the KMC will be able to get more funds from state and central schemes meant for development of infrastructure in big cities. The civic limits have not been expanded for last several decades and it has thus become a hurdle in getting the infrastructure developed. Baba Indulkar, a city-based activist, said, “The government has set up an authority for development of villages which has failed to deliver and therefore merging with the KMC is the only sustainable way to bring uniformity in development between rural and urban areas.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/opposition-to-merger-proposal-of-kmc-gathers-momentum/articleshow/85907087.cms||---

This was informed by deputy municipal commissioner Nikhil More on Friday. “It’s the responsibility of every citizen to keep the city clean and garbage free. The health inspectors have been asked to take strict action against those found throwing garbage or burning it,” he said. “Those who are found throwing garbage in the open will be fined. The KMC health staff should look that the garbage pickers are not involved in burning waste. The waste should be segregated at source. The wet and dry garbage should be collected separately,” he added. After the KMC removed the roadside garbage containers, people started throwing the garbage in the open. The locals say that the garbage collection vans are not regular and they have no other option but to dump waste. Suchita Kulkarni, a school teacher from Sarnaik Colony, said, “The garbage collection van is not regular in most of the areas. Sometimes the vans do not come for two to three days. How can the civic body expect us to keep the garbage at our homes for these many days? If the garbage collection vans come regularly at a specific time then why will someone throw the garbage in open.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-civic-body-steps-up-heat-on-litterbugs/articleshow/85907084.cms||---

The woman, Kondabai Trimukhe (67), was asleep in their one-room kitchen house when her husband, Shankar, who lost his legs five years ago, crawled towards her early the morning and stabbed her repeatedly on the chest, stomach and waist with a knife which has been seized by the police. The elderly woman had been admitted to hospital where she passed away on Wednesday. The couple’s daughter-in-law witnessed the murder, the police said. The elderly man had not been keeping good health, said an official from Powai police station. “He was fed up and frustrated... He was being treated for poor mental health,” the officer said, adding that the elderly couple quarrelled often. Shankar was arrested on the spot. His daughter-in-law, who was also in the house, woke up on hearing the elderly woman’s screams, the police official said, adding that there were bloodstains all over the wall of the house. “The accused is mentally ill.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai to soon get 16 more traffic police chowkies||MUMBAI: Because of increasing motor vehicles in the city, the traffic police will soon set up 16 more chowkies. Currently, the city has 34 traffic chowkies, manned by a force of around 2,800 traffic personnel. The move is likely to reduce the response time of traffic cops on the field, with a greater deployment of personnel to maintain smooth vehicular flow. There are over 37 lakh vehicles in Mumbai at present. At many places, the distance between two traffic chowkies will be reduced once the new ones are commissioned to share responsibility. For example, a new chowkie is being planned for Dongri. As of today, Mohammed Ali Road, Dongri, Reay Road, Dockyard Road, Sewri and Cotton Green fall between the Pydhonie and Wadala traffic chowkies. “The new chowkie will be given substantial jurisdiction from the Pydhonie and Wadala areas. This will reduce the burden on the two existing ones. It will also help quicken response time,” said an officer. Senior cops have been asked to identify locations where new chowkies could be started. “First, we are looking for contacting government agencies to get space. In case there is no government land or buildings available, we have plans to take space on rent and start chowkies,” said the officer. The rent will be decided once a space or building is chosen. “Police commissioner Hemant Nagrale has approved the starting of the new traffic police chowkies,” the officer said. “We will try to start tthem soon,” said Rajvardhan Sinha, joint commissioner of police, traffic. The traffic police are planning chowkies at MRA Marg (located near CSMT), Marine Drive, and D B Marg, a new chowkie in Vikhroli to cover Eastern Express Highway on the Kanjurmarg side and adjacent areas, and another chowkie at Trombay to divide the workload of areas like Mankhurd and Deonar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-city-to-soon-get-16-more-traffic-police-chowkies/articleshow/85913883.cms||Mateen Hafeez

Environment minister Aaditya Thackeray performed the bhoomi pujan for the project on Friday. It will be constructed on an existing storm water drain at an estimated cost of Rs 2.5 crore and is expected to be ready by December, in time to be formally inaugurated before the 2022 civic elections. The deck will come up on the north end, opposite HP petrol pump, providing an expansive view of the sea and Queen’s Necklace. Designed in the form of a tree with a long trunk that juts out into the sea it leads to a semi-circular viewing deck. The adjoining police station will be upgraded too. There will be a seating area with a public toilet facility before the start of the viewing deck. On Thursday, Thackeray inaugurated the revamped Mahim beach, where a viewing tower has been set up. The Mahim beach revival project cost approximately Rs 6 crore. It has helped create a public space on the sea front along Mahim Causeway, where vehicles used to be parked. Earlier this year, a viewing deck was constructed at Dadar-Chowpatty, close to Chaityabhoomi over a storm water drain. The oldest deck at Malabar Hill, atop the water reservoir, offers the best view of Queen’s Necklace, while one at CSMT, opposite BMC headquarters, was another popular stop as it offered a spectacular view of the railway station, a UNESCO world heritage site, in the midst of heavy traffic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-girgaum-beach-to-get-citys-4th-viewing-deck-for-rs-2-5-crore/articleshow/85912104.cms||---

---||Delhi||No dry ration for children, rights body notice to north Delhi corpn||NEW DELHI: The issue of non-distribution of ration to primary school students in the North Delhi Municipal Corporation areas has been highlighted again after Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) has sent a notice to its director (education) for failing to give out dry ration of the midday meal since July 2020. The commission said the corporation had not lifted foodgrains from godowns for distribution among students of primary grades despite multiple communications from Delhi government. “Prima facie, this is a serious governance lapse and the commission has decided to take up the matter seriously,” DCPCR stated in its notice, asking the director to file an explanation within two weeks. DCPCR chairperson Anurag Kundu said, “The corporation has not even lifted the foodgrain, depriving lakhs of children their right to basic nutrition and, hence, life. This is nothing short of crime.” Corporation commissioner Sanjay Goel said they would submit a reply soon. “Also, we have made all arrangements and as soon as the stock is received, we will distribute it within seven days.” A senior official claimed that the delay had been caused due to technical issues. “The term of the NGO responsible for the distribution got over and the new one was not listed. By March 31, the financial year was over, so we could not distribute anything. Later we received supplies, but didn’t get permission to distribute,” he said. “We have written to the Centre and Delhi government to revalidate the quarterly order, but are still waiting for directions.” Following the notice, the education department on Friday issued a circular to all school in-charges to distribute by Saturday evening the stock of oil and pulses received from the Centre. Following a Supreme Court directive last year, the Centre had issued guidelines to ensure that Covid-19 does not adversely affect the nutritional wellbeing of students who used to receive midday meals at schools before the pandemic. Delhi government also approved distribution of dry ration kits from July 2020 to March 2021. While the ration is provided by Food Corporation of India to state governments, which supply it to civic bodies on a quarterly basis, pulses and oil come directly from the Centre through central agencies. AAP councillors have questioned the delay in even distributing oil and pulses. “The civic body is not serious. That’s why it has not lifted the ration sanctioned by Delhi government at the beginning of April,” alleged Ajay Sharma, AAP councillor from Mukundpur. Shrama will go for a check at schools in his ward on Saturday as parents have not only complained about non-distribution but the available stock is also said to have been damaged. Chhail Bihari Goswami, leader of the House, said, “We clarified everything earlier too and our education department had written to Delhi government for permission several times. The supply has been restricted due to the dilly-dallying attitude of Delhi government.” About oil and pulses, an official said the department had been verifying the weight and quality of the kits before distribution. “There has been no delay,” he claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-dry-ration-for-children-rights-body-notice-to-corpn/articleshow/85913892.cms||Vibha Sharma

Candidates are now taking a break after a fortnightlong campaign. However poll enthusiasts, particularly youths, in all the three cities are busy in betting over the results. Punters are said to be banking more on BJP in Hubballi-Dharwad; Congress, BJP and MES in Belagavi; and Congress and BJP in Kalaburagi. Some are betting over the victory/ defeat of candidates, while others on the winning margin. As the margin would normally be in double or triple digits in ULB polls, youths are betting even for a 100-vote margin. Betting is done with money, motorbike and car in urban areas and tractor-trailor in semi-urban areas like Unkal, Bhairidevarakoppa, Navalur, Nagashettikoppa, Gokul, Tarihal and Bidnal. Some punters have also put up their sites, it is said. A paan shop owner at a bar and restaurant at Channamma Circle here said betting turned brisk after August 26, the last date to withdraw nominations, and the poll fray took a final shape. “Till then, it was slow as candidates themselves were in a confusion over getting ticket from their parties. I have heard many people are offering to host a party if their candidate wins,” he added. Ramesh, who did not wish to reveal his second name, runs a small shop on Gokul Road. He said betting is taking place among well-known friends. “Normally, they bet for their favourite candidate while sitting at hotels or bars or at gardens in residential areas,” he added. It’s said that there was not much betting on which party gets a majority, but it’s all about the candidate and the margin. “My bet is on our candidate who I’m sure wins with a margin of over 500 votes, the tough fight notwithstanding,” said a buyer at APMC. A senior citizen in Sainagar said betting is less this time compared to HDMC elections in 2014. “Financial crisis due to the pandemic has had its effect on betting too,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/punters-bet-big-time-on-civic-poll-results/articleshow/85907652.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

The MoU was signed by Professor Achla M. Raina, dean of academic affairs of IIT-Kanpur, and Gagan Chaturvedi, deputy director general (CCD and human resources) of the Ordnance Factory Board. Under this MoU, IIT-K will be offering a customized master of design (M.Des.) programme (course) for officers sponsored by OFB, which will help them design sophisticated weapons and weapon-systems for India’s needs. This is a unique academic program, the first in India, and perhaps in entire Asia as well. The programme will help OFB officers not only acquire expertise in general design principles, but also in several weapon-specific technologies. Such industry-specific knowledge is usually not available through regular engineering programmes. The programme will also require students to undertake projects which will be directly relevant to the area of weapons design and production. This IIT-K-OFB joint initiative is closely aligned to the national Aatmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan in the area of weapons in particular, and defence technologies and products in general. The programme will also be highly relevant to India’s private sector companies which are venturing into the area of weapon systems.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/iit-k-ofb-to-work-jointly-onatmanirbharta-in-defence/articleshow/85909454.cms||---

Talking to TOI, Salunke said he had a meeting with the private firm entrusted with the proper upkeep of the road in that part of the the highway. “I have served an ultimatum to the contractor that the National Highways Authorities of India (NHAI) would impose hefty fines on the latter if complaints from road users continue to come about the poor condition of the road,” he said. Salunke chaired the meeting last Wednesday as the NHAI has been receiving complaints from road users about its deplorable condition. “The contractor claimed that pre-monsoon work was undertaken in that stretch. But the rain again damaged the road on many parts of the highway. But we have made it clear that the contractor has to strengthen that part of the road in a better manner so that the problem does not reoccur during next monsoon,” said Salunke. The Mumbai-Agra highway condition might improve in the Kasara Ghat section only after October, once the rain subsides or stops. The company responsible for the upkeep of the highway would until then continue taking short-term measures to see that the road is at least motorable. A senior official of the private firm said that the road was currently being repaired on a temporary basis since the monsoon is yet to get over. “Our work to strengthen the stretch will start from October onwards when rains subside,” added the official. The official claimed that the firm had taken up pre-monsoon road work in the ghat section, but the asphalt was washed away by the sudden rain in May.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nhai-pledges-measures-to-improve-ghat-section-condition/articleshow/85907098.cms||---

---||Goa||Goa may see Covid cases rise by month-end, peak in October, says expert||PANAJI: The state may see a rise in Covid-19 cases by the end of this month, and a potential third wave may peak in October, an expert has said. Even as the average positivity rate hovers around the 2%-mark, a member of the state expert committee said that the upsurge may not be as devastating as the second wave, and that although vaccination is likely to hold the state in good stead, reducing hospitalisations and mortalities, it would be foolish if people stopped taking precautions in public spaces. In Goa, over 4.3 lakh people have been fully vaccinated, and around 7.2 lakh have been partially vaccinated. “It must be remembered that two doses of the vaccine reduce severity and death. Take both doses on time, but don’t carry a false sense of security upon vaccination, as infections may still occur and spread in the family,” he said. He also said that there have been several cases in Goa wherein people contracted the virus after vaccination, and some even after they had taken both their doses, but the majority recovered in home isolation without developing complications. “Irrespective of vaccination, people should strictly wear masks, sanitise their hands, and avoid crowded places. It is better not to visit a market or shopping mall that is crowded,” he said. He also suggested that vulnerable populations such as senior citizens, pregnant women, people with diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, and cancer must get vaccinated without delay, and under no circumstances ignore Covid symptoms. They should test early and promptly seek medical care if positive. While active surveillance will help pick Covid mutants and initiate immediate containment measures, he said it is equally important to obtain reports of mutant strains. Due to a lack of facilities internally, Goa has to rely on laboratories outside the state. Besides delta, the delta-plus variant was also detected in Goa last month, however, results were only received after a month. After the bitter experience of the second wave, when the state’s healthcare system crumbled along with the oxygen crisis, preparations for the predicted third wave have started early, but only time will tell if the preparations are adequate. Fresh curbs on S Goa courtsSouth Goa principal district and sessions judge Irshad Agha has issued directions to courts in his district in view of Covid-19 cases. Courts have been asked not to take up more than 25 cases per session. They have also been asked not to pass adverse orders in case of absence.

---||India||MHA curbs on foreign funding of Kerala NGO||NEW DELHI: The home ministry has suspended the foreign funding licence of a prominent Kerala-based NGO linked to influential Sunni leader from the state, Sheikh Aboobacker Ahmed, after detecting violation of provisions of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act, 2010 (FCRA). The suspension of FCRA registration bars Markazul Ighasathil Kairiyathil Hindiyya – the top foreign-funded entity in Kozhikode, with over Rs 146-crore receipts from abroad in the last three years – from receiving funding from international donors without prior permission or till revocation of the suspension order. The association, funded mostly by charities based in the Gulf, can make a representation against the suspension order, following which the home ministry may either review the suspension or go ahead with permanent cancellation of its FCRA registration after a 180-day period, extendable by another 180 days. The prime violations cited by MHA in its suspension order issued on August 27, 2021 include misutilisation and diversion of foreign contributions by Markazul, which also operates under the brand ‘Relief and Charitable Foundation of India (RCFI)’; misrepresentation of facts; and failure to submit annual FCRA returns for the year 2019-20. A senior functionary of the NGO confirmed to TOI that the association had received the suspension order. “Some clerical errors are cited as reasons for suspension. We will clarify everything after a careful reading of the order,” he said. The suspension of Markazul’s FCRA licence followed a due inquiry process, with an MHA questionnaire sent to it on 05.04.2018. A government official told TOI that the reply to the questionnaire revealed that the association had violated Section 12(4)(a)(vi), Section 18 and Section 19 of the FCRA. According to sources, a foreign contribution amount of Rs 50 lakh withdrawn by the NGO for purchase of land was received back on 13.01.2015 upon cancellation of the land deal. This amount was however not deposited in the foreign contribution-designated bank account, but retained in cash in the NGO’s office. Markazul claimed Rs 50-lakh cash was distributed for its orphan care programme. However enquiry and NGO’s records showed that Rs 50 lakh cash was distributed between July 2014 and December 2014, before the amount was received back on 13.01.2015. “Hence the amount of Rs 50 lakh received on account of cancelled land deed is not accounted for and appears to have been diverted/misutilized,” the order said adding this was a violation of Section 12(4)(a)(vi), 18 and 19 of the FCRA, 2010. The order also points to purchase of a vehicle in name of an individual and not the association, citing it as another violation of Section 12(4)(a)(vi) of FCRA. It further stated that the NGO had utilised foreign funds for construction of a building on land taken on lease by Islamic Education Board of India from Waqf Board of India. The MHA cited utilisation of foreign contribution for creation of assets on land on which the association has no claim, as a “violation of Section 12(4)(a)(vi) of the Act”. Markazul also failed to file its annual returns for the year 2019-20, a violation of Section 18 of FCRA. A Markazul official told TOI that the “online window” for filing annual returns was closed just before they could upload the returns. Markazul was founded in 2000 as a vision of Kanthapuram A P Aboobacker Musliyar, a popular figure with politicians in Kerala and referred to as ‘Grand Mufti of India’ by supporters.

---||Kolhapur||Ties with MVA could sour if Raju Shetti not made MLC||Kolhapur: Political analysts feel that the Swabhmani Paksha’s ties with the MahaVikas Aghadi (MVA) could become strained if the party leader Raju Shetti’s name is dropped from the list of 12 nominees through Governor’s quota to legislative council. Ever since chief minister Uddhav Thackeray led delegation of cabinet ministers of Mahavikas Aghadi government met Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari two days back, the political circles are rife with speculation that Shetti may not feature in a revised list that the government will send to the Guv. Before 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Shetti left Bharatiya Janata Party led National Democratic Alliance and joined Congress-NCP led United Progressive Alliance and he was promised one legislative council seat for him or any of his party leaders. Political experts claim that if Shetti’s name is dropped, then he is likely to leave the UPA formally and may again come close to BJP. Prakash Pawar, professor with Shivaji University’s political science department, observed that the BJP had suffered electoral loss in assembly elections after Shetti distanced from the NDA. “A section of farmers looks at Shetti as their leader. The Congress and NCP are considered to have their support base among the rich farmers. If Shetti’s name or nomination is cancelled, then the rift between Shetti and Cong-NCP is unavoidable. The Cong-NCP may face same fate as BJP faced in 2019 assembly elections.” Since MVA was formed and three parties came to power in state, Shetti has remained critical of the alliance over farmers issues. In Pandharpur-Mangalwedha bypoll, in which NCP candidate faced defeat despite an emotive factor in their favour, Swabhimani Paksha had fielded a candidate. Also, Shetti took stand against MVA leaders in the election of Gokul cooperative dairy, largest cooperative dairy in the state, though the panel led by MVA leaders came to power. Similarly, Shetti is criticising the state government over the delay in providing relief to the flood-affected farmers. Shetti is known as a farmers’ leader and has climbed the political ladder from a zilla parishad membership to the MP post. He is a two-time MP. He had joined the BJP-led NDA ahead of 2014 election, however left the alliance in 2017. Ahead of 2019 Lok Sabha, he joined hands with Cong-NCP led UPA but faced defeat. They contested two seats but lost on both counts. Shetti’s name suggested to Governor to make him MLC in June 2019. Shetti along with hundreds of flood-affected farmers are marching through villages along the Panchganga river. His ‘Panchaganga Parikrama’ entered third dayon Friday. On the fifth day, Shetti along with farmers are going to take ‘Jal Samadhi’ at Narsinhawadi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/ties-with-mva-could-sour-if-raju-shetti-not-made-mlc/articleshow/85907103.cms||---

He was wanted in over 30 cases of crimes, including murder. He was also an accused of the murder of a former zila panchayat member Balbir Singh alias Jaleshwar Singh, who was shot dead on July 7 this year. According to reports, ADG (Varanasi zone) Brai Bhushan had announced a reward of Rs. 1 lakh on Harish on Thursday. The criminal had been absconding after the murder of Balbir.

Announcing this on Friday, DGP D Gautam Sawang said the state police has been ranked number one in passport seva. “We’ve been able to process (passport) within two to three days. This has been possible with the use of technology, as we can check the background of the person using various applications such as integrated database software like e-Hunt,” Sawang said, adding that they are equipped with a 360-degree access of data on a passport applicant, thus reducing the time taken by doing things manually. The average time taken by police to complete passport verification in the country stands around seven days. Sawang showed the operation of their in-house software e-Hunt which integrates criminal information of a person including those registered in other states, private complaints, court status and even traffic violations. As an example, the status of the infamous assault on mandal revenue officer D Vanajakshi showed that the case was closed on February 2019 as ‘false’. Cops searched controversial former TDP MLA Chintamaneni Prabhakar on e-Hunt which immediately showed that he had 84 cases registered against since 1995, including their current status. “We can do a simple check on passport applicant and gather such information instantly,” Sawang added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ap-cops-fastest-in-country-in-passport-verification/articleshow/85909479.cms||---

He held a review meeting on Friday with the officials of Delhi Jal Board and Irrigation and flood control department to discuss the drains’ rejuvenation plan. “Najafgarh, Supplementary and Shahdara link drains will be cleaned and beautified. All major drains, including these three, will be converted into clean water channels again. Currently, these drains are struggling with solid waste, sludge and wastewater. After these drains are cleaned and beautified, only clean water will flow into the drains entering the Yamuna. This will also help in recharging groundwater levels of the area adjacent to the drains,” Jain said. He directed the department to look for solutions to the problems hampering the water quality of the drains. “Cleaning the Yamuna is the prime target of the government and multiplicity of agencies should not slow down the progress of the work. The solutions should be inbuilt in the project itself to achieve holistic development of the drains,” the minister added. Cleaning the Yamuna was one of the ten key promises made by Aam Aadmi Party in the last assembly election. After the meeting, Jain tweeted, “Delhi government is working towards rejuvenation & beautification of major drains flowing into the Yamuna. Drains will be cleaned, beautified & will carry only clean water. All major drains like Najafgarh, Supplementary & Shahdara drain will be converted to clean water channels again.(sic)” In 2019, National Green Tribunal had ordered to set up new STPs and carry out bioremediation in Delhi’s drains, but the initial deadline was missed. Untreated sewage is one of the key reasons behind pollution in the Yamuna.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/all-major-drains-to-be-cleaned-beautified/articleshow/85913934.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Ashwini Waghmale, deputy municipal commissioner and in-charge of the unauthorized construction removal and encroachment, said they had received a complaint that the clerk was in close contact with a few hawkers and their leaders. “An internal inquiry exposed his collusion with hawkers. He was given an opportunity to clarify following which action was taken. The action has no connection with the attack on the assistant commissioner at Kasarwadavli,” she clarified.

---||Mumbai||No local body polls without OBC quota in Mumbai: All-party meet||Mumbai: With local body polls fast approaching, an all-party meeting chaired by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday came to a consensus that elections should not be held until the other backward class (OBC) quota is restored. The state will seek empirical data on OBCs and ask for the polls to be postponed by 2-3 months, if required. Sources in the state election commission, though, said the polls could not be postponed for grounds such as reservations and could only be deferred for major calamities. “We all feel the OBC reservations should be saved. We will ask for empirical data on OBC representation from the state backward class commission, as required by the Supreme Court. We will also ask the Centre for empirical data from the SECC (Socio Economic and Caste Census) 2011,” said OBC leader and food and civil supplies minister Chhagan Bhujbal. In March, the SC had struck down the 27% OBC quota for local body polls on the grounds that the combined quota of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes (SC and ST) and OBCs could not exceed the 50% cap. The state’s review petition on the issue was dismissed. The SC asked for empirical data on OBCs in each local body to allow for a restoration of the quota within the 50% cap. The state faces local body elections for zilla parishad and gram panchayats by December. Elections for 10 major municipal corporations, including Mumbai, are due by next February. The quota issue is important because the powerful Maratha community and the OBCs which are more numerous are caught in a struggle for political dominance in the state. Political parties do not want to risk alienating either group. Sources in the state election commission said it is bound to hold the polls before the term of the local body ends. “The polls can only be postponed for major calamities. They have been postponed earlier this year owing to the pandemic after SC directives. To seek any postponement, the state will have to approach the SC since this issue is before it,” said a senior state election commission official. Once the empirical data is in, the government could consider an ordinance or amendment to restore OBC reservations, after ensuring the combined quota of SC, ST and OBCs does not exceed the 50% cap. “Even after this, there are concerns that districts with a high tribal population like Gadchiroli, Palghar and Nandurbar may have no room for an OBC quota after fulfilling the ST quota,” said Bhujbal. “We have unanimously agreed to try and restore OBC reservations. At least through these efforts of seeking empirical data, we will be able to restore more than 80% of the reserved seats for OBCs,” said BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis. The BJP’s OBC leader, former minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule, said, “We will not allow the MVA ministers to roam around freely if OBC reservations are not restored.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/no-local-body-polls-without-obc-quota-in-mumbai-all-party-meet/articleshow/85913981.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

A senior official of the FDA said the food inspectors are continuously checking if such banned products were being sold through shops or kiosks. A release by the FDA stated that gutka, pan masala, flavoured tobacco and other tobacco products are banned by the state government as its consumption of such products leads to serious ailments like cancer. A number of people consume such products and at the same time many shopkeepers and kiosk owners also sell such products clandestinely for personal gains, without giving a thought that this could lead to serious illness among the consumers. “Whenever we come across sale of such products we take strict action against the shopkeepers, kiosk owners concerned so that they do not indulge in such act in the future,” an FDA official said. “The FDA not only seals the shops or kiosks used for selling the banned tobacco products, but also seize the vehicles that are used for sale or transport of such products” he said. .”The FDA further sends proposals about cancelling the registration of such vehicles and licenses of the shops,” he added. In 2020-21, the FDA conducted a total of 53 raids in the district and sealed banned products worth Rs 3.67 crore. As many as 44 shops were sealed and 9 vehicles used for transporting banned tobacco products were seized. On this backdrop, the FDA has appealed to the citizens in general to not produce, stock, distribute or sell gutka, pan masala or other banned tobacco products.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/fda-warns-of-action-against-people-selling-banned-tobacco-products/articleshow/85907117.cms||Santosh Sonawane

That is the speed at which Aaryan Shukla can calculate numbers, making him the youngest mental maths calculation champion at the age of 11. The class 6 Delhi Public School, Nashik, student was ahead of his competitor, also an Indian, at the 3-hour online Mind Sports Olympiad (UK), 2021. He took home the gold medal in open and junior category. A series of mathematical challenges was given to the four finalists. Aaryan was the youngest. Addition of 10-digit numbers, multiplication of 7-digit into 7-digit numbers, division of 8-digit numbers by 5-digit numbers, square roots (up to 12 digits – perfect and imperfect), cube roots (exact and inexact), fraction additions and multiplication, calendar dates, prime factors. No pen, paper or calculation device could be used. What was allowed was the brain. “For a question where 20 seconds were allowed, Aaryan took just one-fourth the time,” said his proud coach Eusebius Noronha. When Aaryan had finished answering the third question of the fourth and final round, he was declared thewinner. He secured 234 points as against the runner-up’s 106. “Aaryan stunned the jury when he asked to be shown the remaining four questions,” said Noronha, who runs the Genius Kids Academy. Aaryan and two others from India and one from Japan reached the finals held on August 30. There were 120 participants in all. Aaryan is now training his brains for the Dubai Memoriad Olympics 2020, likely to be held next year. His parents Meenal and Nitin, were scouting for a mental activity class for Aaryan when he was 6. A strict diet to keep the brain functioning to its full, reduced screen time to protect the eye are rituals Aaryan follows. “His screen time increased with online learning last year. So we did away with the television,” said his father.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-11-year-old-whizz-kid-is-youngest-maths-champ/articleshow/85913957.cms||Sandhya Nair

Nearly 60 lakh people have received at least one vaccine dose (over 60,000 on Friday) in Kolkata whereas the city’s eligible population as per data available is around 32 lakh. Over 17 lakh people in Kolkata have been completely vaccinated. Yet, long queues in city vaccination centres are starting since day-break, and in some cases, from the night before. Gauri Mondol started from her village in Bongaon along with her husband at 4am on Thursday. The couple in their late 60s took a train to Sealdah and headed to the School of Tropical Medicine where they reached around 6.45am. By then, they were behind 150 people in the queue. “After 4 hours, we were lucky to get a token. But it was a close shave as they only had 200 doses. So if we had arrived even 15 minutes later, we would not have got a token,” said husband Gour Mondol. People are queuing up at vaccination centres from 4am and almost 80% are from various districts in south Bengal, officials at STM said. People are coming from places like Basirhat, Taki, Krishnagore, Jhargram, Uluberia, Pandua and other far-flung areas to get vaccinated. “Twice I went to Barasat General hospital and they turned us away because they had less than 100 doses. Many people from our village managed to get their jabs at the School of Tropical Medicine. So almost everybody from our village is coming here now instead of going to Barasat or other places. At least we are sure to get the jab if we queue at dawn,” said Biswajit Ghosh, who came from Basirhat. At Medical College & Hospital, Kolkata, almost 80% of those turning up to get jabbed are from suburbs and districts. The picture is same in south too. Mritunjay Barui, a Dakshin Barasat resident, reached Baghajatin station late on Thursday night. He spent the night on the railway platform and by 7am, he reached the KMC-run vaccination clinic at Vivekananda Park located close to Baghajatin market. Despite reaching early, Barui found he was behind 20 others in the queue. Of these 20 recipients, 15 had come from different areas of South 24 Parganas. However, by 11.30am, Barui walked out of the vaccination clinic after taking the jab. “I could not get a vaccine in Dakshin Barasat, so I came here,” Barui, a vegetable vendor, said. KMC-run vaccination centres have been witnessing a steady spurt in the number of recipients from Canning, Diamond Harbour, Dakshin Barasat and Lakkhikantapur. According to a KMC health department official, several clinics in Garia, Patuli, Baghajatin, Jadavpur, Dhakuria and Kasba were recording a spurt in the number of outstation vaccine recipients. KMC officials said this trend was first noticed a fortnight ago. “As of now, we have adequate stock of vaccines. We are allocating 300 doses per clinic and over 600 doses for each of the mega centres. Around 60% of our daily allocation is being for south Kolkata clinics and mega centres,” a KMC health department official said. Some of the KMC mega vaccination centres that have been recording outstation recipients include Bhowanipore Education Society, Jai Hind Bhawan (Harish Mukherjee Road) and Ahindra Mancha (Chetla), among other centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/limited-jabs-back-home-district-recipients-throng-city-vax-clinics/articleshow/85909566.cms||Saikat Ray

Commencing arguments over the framing of charges, Suryavanshi cited the Central Bureau of Investigation investigation and submitted before special UAPA judge S R Navander that Dabholkar’s murder was part of a larger conspiracy to create terror in the society and, hence, it must be seen as an act of terrorism. “In an incident in which firearms are used to create terror in the minds of public at large or in a particular section of the society, for instance, members of the Andhashraddha Nirmoolan Samiti (the anti-superstition body headed by Dabholkar), then such an act is punishable under Section 16 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA),” the special prosecutor submitted. Suryavanshi submitted, “The state home department has accorded sanction to the CBI to prosecute all the accused under Section 16 of the UAPA. The Central Bureau of Investigation has come out with a prima facie case to frame charges under the said section.” The prosecution had earlier furnished a revised draft of charges on behalf of the CBI proposing charges under Sections 302 (murder), 120-B (conspiracy) and 34 (common intention), besides, Section 16 (punishment for terrorism) under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) and three sections of the Arms Act. Judge Navander heard Suryavanshi as well as defence lawyer Virendra Ichalkaranjikar before posting the matter for an order on September 7. Once the order is passed, the long-awaited trial in Dabholkar murder case will commence. Suryavanshi relied heavily on witness statements recorded by the Central Bureau of Investigation to establish how and for what motive the accused entered into a conspiracy, plotted and executed the murder. Ichalkaranjikar opposed the draft charges, pointing out that the CBI in its first chargesheet had named Vinay Pawar and Sarang Akolkar as the suspects who shot at Dabholkar and also claimed that eyewitnesses had identified Akolkar and Pawar. Later, in its supplementary chargesheet, the Central Bureau of Investigation came out with another theory naming Andure and Kalaskar as the two shooters. Ichalkaranjikar argued that the CBI holding two sets of shooters responsible for the murder and coming out with conflicting theories had no evidentiary value under the Evidence Act. There is no independent witness to suggest direct involvement of shooters in the murder case. He submitted that there was no evidence against Tawde in the first chargesheet. The statement given against Tawde by a witness was recorded in 2016, almost three years after the murder. “There are no eye-witness statements and technical investigation to show that Bhave conducted a recce before Dabholkar was murdered,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cbi-presses-terrorism-charges-against-five-in-dabholkar-case/articleshow/85912062.cms||Asseem Shaikh

---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Uniform smart cards for licence, registration soon||KOLKATA: The state transport department is switching to the systems of one nation, one driving licence (DL) and one nation, one vehicle registration certificate (RC) with the introduction of smart cards that will have a uniform look, format, colour, design and security features across the country. All new driving licences will also be embedded with a SIM card-like microchip and QR codes. The smart driving licence and vehicle registration documents will be valid across the country and a vehicle owner will not be required to change them after relocation. The state transport department has begun the groundwork for the new system and the rollout is expected by the middle of this month. Till now, different states and Union territories had been issuing their own driving licences in varied formats, which led to confusion for government and law enforcement agencies. New data shows that over 25% of Indians hold more than one driving licence and continue committing road offences. In Bengal, the transport department had discontinued issuing driving licence and registration smart cards for the past year-and-a-half as the contract with the vendor had expired and a new vendor had not been assigned due to the pandemic. The documents that were being issued were on plain paper. But now a new contractor has been appointed.. “There will be extra security features and the card will bear all the information about the driver and his past records of road rule violations,” said a transport department officer. Like Metro cards, all new DLs will have near-field communication (NFC) features that will enable traffic cops to access the details easily. Smart driving licences will feature the national and state emblems along with the name of issuing authority. It will also state the blood group and declaration for organ donation. Other details present in the existing DLs, like type of vehicle, will also be included. Learner’s licence will also become uniform across states. With the new BS-VI norms in force, the smart registration certificates will clearly mention chassis number and emission norm (BS-IV/BS-VI). A ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) report says over 32,000 new driving licences are issued every day in India and over 43,000 vehicles are registered daily. In Bengal, 500 new vehicles are registered and more than 300 licences are issued. MoRTH is also working on a database to reduce redundancy and multiplicity of driving licences. Having multiple driving licences is illegal and the government will initiate a crackdown against people with more than one. In the new format, the use of DigiLocker and the mParivahan app requires one to link Aadhaar and driving licence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/uniform-smart-cards-for-licence-registration-soon/articleshow/85909585.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Pune||Decline in TDR rates affects slum rehabilitation projects||Pune: As many as 60 slum rehabilitation projects have been affected owing to 40% reduction in transfer of development rights (TDR) rates. These projects are built mostly on TDR compensation and are finding very few takers as developers are not coming forward to take them up. A meeting regarding this was held by Pune guardian minister and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Friday. According to Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) officials, 125 slum rehabilitation projects are in the pipeline, while 60 are underway. Most of them are dependent on TDR so they have either stopped or moving at a very slow speed. The TDR rate had gone up to Rs4,500 per sqft during peak consumption, but has come down to Rs600/sqft to Rs1,000/sqft. “The premium FSI and other instruments for compensation introduced in unified development control rules have pushed the TDR on the back foot. Since TDR has no demand, the developers are not coming forward to build the projects by accepting TDR compensation. Authorities cannot give cash compensation to developers for building slum rehabilitation projects due to cash crunch. SRA projects have been stalled due to this,” said a senior SRA official. As per the SRA data, there are 486 slums in the Pune municipal limits housing 30% of the city population. Their rehabilitation is a major concern due to lack of space in these areas. The SRA has listed some demands to state government for speeding up slum rehabilitation projects. These include no restriction on the height of the building and provision in development control rules so that more TDR can be loaded on the SRA buildings. Currently, only around 20% TDR can be loaded, which should be increased to at least 30%, officials feel. “The authority has given the proposal to the state government. Compulsory consumption of TDR should be introduced for rehabilitation of projects. If the TDR demand improves, it will not only help these projects, but other civic projects as well where project affected people are demanding cash compensation,” said Rajendra Nimbalkar, chief executive officer, SRA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/decline-in-tdr-rates-affects-slum-rehabilitation-projects/articleshow/85912099.cms||---

Set to begin this Sunday, cops said it was a unique initiative where residents and cops will work together for better safety and surveillance. “I am a banker and have a set work schedule. But, at the same time, I realize I have to make certain contributions to the society. Hence, I have volunteered for the programme. I leave home around 5.30am everyday and return around 7.30am-8am after a jog. I will maintain surveillance between AL and CE Block parks. If I notice anything suspicious, I will immediately inform cops,” said Dipika Kumari (31), an assistant manager at a nationalised bank and a resident of AL Block in New Town. The idea of a Resistance Group that will include locals and police was floated by DCP New Town Bishop Sarkar during a recent meeting with a residents’ body, following which 103 people volunteered till Friday night. The group is set to meet senior officials of the commissionerate on Sunday for a final blue print of the plan, after which they will begin work. “We will not disrupt our everyday work but will get some time out to help cops with physical surveillance,” said Samaresh Das, the chairperson of New Town Forum and News, which had been voicing the issue of women’s safety in the township for the past two months after back-to-back incidents of snatching and harassment. According to the plan, volunteers will be allotted multiple slots — mostly in the early morning and evening — based on their morning and evening walk schedules. A senior officer of Bidhannagar City Police said that, at the meeting, they will be briefing the residents about the final execution of the voluntary service and the responsibilities of the volunteers. At the same time, they will discuss a self-defence workshop under the state government’s women’s safety programme Swayamsiddha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/new-town-walkers-vow-to-keep-vigil-help-cops/articleshow/85909619.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

---||Kolkata||Keep infrastructure ready to tackle third wave, West Bengal govt tells private hospitals||KOLKATA: The health department on Friday asked private hospitals to stay prepared and make sure they are not caught unawares by the third Covid wave. In a virtual meeting, senior health officials asked private hospitals to be prepared with adequate beds, equipment, oxygen, medicine and logistics with special focus on paediatric care. The state government is already working on preparations to counter the possible third wave for weeks at state-run hospitals. “The number of fresh cases seems to be going up slightly. With festivities ahead and people going out on shopping and other activities, we expect the numbers to rise. Along with government health facilities, private hospitals, too, need to be prepared so that we can together handle the situation better,” said a senior health official. Even as private hospitals are waiting and watching the situation before switching gears, many have started identifying wards, including paediatric facilities, that can be converted for Covid-19 treatment quickly. For example, RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) has identified 35-bedded general paediatric ward, 24 PICU and 6 NICU beds with paediatric and neonatal ventilators. “At RTIICS, we are prepared with a comprehensive paediatric and neonatal Covid treatment set-up where paediatric consultants and trained nurses would be available round the clock,” said R Venkatesh, regional director (east) of Narayana Health. Simmardeep Gill, COO of CK Birla CMRI, said the hospital had identified 22 beds — a combination of PICU and NICU — in the existing paediatric ward for Covid-positive children. “For adult patients, we are currently operating 24 Covid beds. We can scale up this count depending on the situation,” said Gill. Hospitals like Medica have also been training medical officers and other staff regularly on handling paediatric patients. “During the peak of second wave, we had enhanced our intensive care bed count to 250. As far as kids are concerned, we have close to 15 paediatric ventilators,” said Medica chairperson Alok Roy. Peerless Hospital has identified two to three wards that can be converted for treatment of paediatric patients. “Now, we have a 40-bed ward with seven ITU beds that are enough to deal with the Covid patient inflow,” said CEO Sudipta Mitra. During the meeting, health officials also wanted to know if hospitals were seeing a rise in number of Covid patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/keep-infra-ready-to-tackle-3rd-wave-state-tells-pvt-hospitals/articleshow/85909644.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

According to the new ‘beat system’, which came into force in 2019, constables and head constables are assigned the task of policing specific areas under the jurisdiction of a station. Constables have to stay in touch with the residents in the areas they have been assigned, and stay abreast of the developments in their respective zones. The objective is to help them gather data that will help prevent untoward incidents in the locality. A police inspector said, “All personnel at stations are directed to patrol specific areas, and this has been working well. But off late, police personnel are burdened with other responsibilities including Covid-related assignments. This may have prevented them from patrolling their areas regularly, but they continue to monitor all activities regularly with inputs from the residents.” All beat constables had been tasked with identifying isolated places, dimly-lit roads and areas where youngsters often crowd after dusk in the wake of the gangrape, the inspector added. “This will help us closely monitor criminal activity. Beat constables play a vital role in nipping criminal activities in the bud,” he said. On average, personnel in one station have to cover 50 ‘beats’. Across Mysuru city, there are 18 police stations under three sub-divisions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/beat-constables-in-mysuru-asked-to-step-up-vigilance/articleshow/85906475.cms||Lawrence Milton
---||Delhi||Panel to find ways to check waterlogging in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Delhi government will form an expert committee with officers from different agencies concerned to tackle the problem of waterlogging. The committee will look into the problem with a holistic approach and make short and long-term plans to deal with it. A high-level meeting was held on Friday to address the issue of waterlogging. Lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, deputy CM Manish Sisodia, PWD minister Satyendar Jain, chief secretary Vijay Dev, commissioners of the three corporations and officials from the departments concerned attended the meeting. Sisodia directed the officers to identify vulnerable sites, make short-term and long-term plans and carry out work at the micro level to get rid of the problem of waterlogging. “This time, Delhi has received more rain than previous years and it faced waterlogging at many places. To eliminate this problem, it is very important that all the agencies related to it work together with coordination, make short-term and long-term plans to deal with this problem and execute them,” he stated. In the meeting, Sisodia said that the responsibility to mitigate this would be of the primary agency with the rest of the agency providing support. The deputy CM directed the officials to remove the problem of waterlogging at two major places of Delhi— ITO and NH-24— at the earliest. “Whenever it rained this year, a pond was formed near ITO and on the slip road of NH-24. This problem will be solved only when all other agencies, including NHAI, corporations and PWD, work together,” Sisodia stated. The recent spells of rain left many parts of the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/panel-to-find-ways-to-check-waterlogging/articleshow/85913990.cms||AlokKNMishra

Patil said the rural police would soon start conducting meetings at the village levels to inform people that Covid cases are cropping up in quite a few talukas of the district and a little negligence on the part of people adhering to the Covid protocol could see a surge in covid cases all over the district In this backdrop, the rural police would be appealing to have one Ganpati celebration in one village. This celebration should also be a low-key event without people gathering in large numbers. The one-village-one-Ganpati has been a feature in the rural parts of Nashik district for the past many years. In 2018, there was one Ganpati celebration in 1,005 villages. While in 2019 there was one village one Ganpati celebration in 1,338 villages. Last year due to the Covid outbreak, there were fewer Ganpati celebrations in the city as well as the district. SP Patil said they will soon conduct meeting at the police station level and appeal to people to follow the government guidelines about the Ganpati celebrations. Senior health officials said cases in Nashik district have dropped considerably compared to the situation during March and April.

Of the 214 teams from 22 states and three countries including India, Nepal and Mexico, 27% of participating teams are from the state. The event was inaugurated on Friday. Of the 214 entries 138 teams are registered for conventional m-BAJA and 76 teams are registered for e-BAJA event. m-Baja uses a mechanical engine while e-Baja is a competition of eclectic cars. The competition tasks the students to conceptualize design, build, test and validate a single-seater four-wheeled All-Terrain Vehicle (ATV) to take part in a series of events, being conducted in three phases this year, giving the teams an opportunity to participate virtually in phase I and II or physically in phase III or both, said the official release. Rashmi Urdhwareshe, president, SAE India said that the competition gives the engineering students a chance to apply the knowledge they have acquired in classrooms. She also said that apart from the technical and design aspects, the competition also teaches the students about team building, leadership, problem-solving, communication, marketing among others. “A vehicle design may appear to be good, but when you test it, it may have a problem which needs to be resolved quickly. This tests their problem-solving skills. There are many skills that they learn while working on the project or during the competition,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/design-build-test-atv-event-draws-214-teams/articleshow/85912195.cms||Ardhra Nair

The ED had earlier questioned Khadse twice in the case and summoned his wife for a statement two times, but she didn’t turn up due to her ill-health. Khadse also claimed that he has been unwell since last month and informed the ED about his inability to present himself for further questioning. Khadse’s lawyer Mohan Tekavde said, “Last month he was operated on in a hospital and his health is not good. We informed the ED about it, along with his medical certificate. We provided all the required documents and cooperated with ED during investigation.” The money laundering case, based on a 2017 police FIR at the Bund Garden police station in Pune against Khadse and others, relates to criminal misconduct by a public servant. The police had closed the case by giving a clean chit to Khadse and filed a C summary report before the court. The court has yet to decide on the C summary. Khadse was revenue minister in the government led by BJP in Maharashtra when the alleged offence took place in 2016. After the controversy, Khadse was forced to resign. Last October, Khadse left the BJP and joined the NCP. The ED registered the money laundering case in 2019 against Khadse and others, and on July 7 this year, it arrested Chaudhari in the case. He is presently in judicial custody. Last week, ED had attached assets worth Rs 5.73 crore belonging to Khadse, Mandakini, Chaudhari and others. The attached properties include bank balance of Rs 86 lakh and immovable properties worth Rs 4.9 crore (purchase value). The ED has not attached the MIDC plot in Bhosari village from where the controversy started as it belonged to government and Khadse’s kin had purchased it fraudulently. The 3-acre industrial plot was acquired by the state MIDC in 1968 from Rasul Akbar Ukani. However, no compensation was paid to Rasul Ukani, who died in 1981. In 2010, a mutation entry for the land was made in the name of MIDC in the revenue record. In 2016, ready reckoner value of the land was about Rs 23 crore, but Khadse allegedly misused his official position as the state revenue minister, helping his kin to purchase the plot fraudulently for Rs 3.75 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ed-files-chargesheet-against-khadse-his-wife-son-in-law/articleshow/85914004.cms||Vijay V Singh
---||Pune||Soon, proctoring system for online learners’ licence tests||Pune: The state transport department will soon launch a proctoring system to ensure that those appearing for the online learners’ licence tests from home don’t resort to unfair means, including using dummy candidates. The online examination facility was introduced two months ago to enable applicants to appear for the test from home, instead of visiting the regional transport offices (RTOs). “Details have been finalized and the system is expected to be rolled out across the RTOs later this month. It will be mandatory for all appearing for the learners’ test from their homes to have a web camera on during the time the exam is on,” an official with the department told TOI. “Before the examination, the real-time photo of the candidate will be matched with the photo on his or her Aadhaar card. The software, which is being developed for this, will verify the photos after which the candidate can start the test. The candidate will be checked from time to time and the movements will be screened during the exam,” the official said. “Any suspicious movements, such as the candidate moving often or doing something unusual, will be checked. If the movements are found doubtful, the candidate will be disqualified. Also, the IP addresses of the system from which the candidate is appearing for the test will be checked. If the IP addresses of more than three candidates match at a given point in time, there will be disqualification. Final touches are being given to the system,” he said. A Pune RTO official said mapping of the IP addresses has been started. “If many people are found giving the test from a single computer, there is definitely something fishy about it. Only those who have integrated their Aadhaar number with the Vahan portal while applying for the test can appear for the online examination,” the official said. Transport department data revealed that until early August, around 1.11 lakh candidates appeared for the test and 2.4 lakh chose to visit RTO offices to write the examination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/soon-proctoring-system-for-online-learners-licence-tests/articleshow/85912171.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Lavasa residents count on final bid decision for pending project||PUNE: Residents of Lavasa hill station are awaiting a final decision with two companies submitting bids for the project ahead of the final deadline that ends in October. The residents have been waiting for the bids for the last three years. Residents said that Mumbai-based Darwin Group of companies and Delhi-based Dhir and Dhir Associates have submitted their bid and are now hoping that the Committee of Creditors weigh the ability of the resolution applicant thoroughly in the interest of the residents, who have been waiting for the last three years for the final decision. “We are hoping for a positive resolution as failure would lead to liquidation, which would be detrimental to the interests of all,” stated Suresh Goswami, a resident of the hill station, who has been on the forefront about raising the issues before the central and state government. In May this year, residents of the hill station project had written to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray urging him to revive the scheme. In their letter, the senior citizens said it has been 34 months since Lavasa approached the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), but there has been no final decision or resolution on who can take over the project. They also sought to know why the government was not interested in the project. The residents had earlier approached the prime minister and the housing affairs ministry. Now, with the bids to be finalised soon, residents are hopeful that their issues would be resolved. “It has been a long wait of three years, as against the law-mandated six-month period, for the process to get to this stage of near completion,” shared Goswami. The company was admitted for Corporate and Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) by the NCLT in August 2018, he pointed out. Vineet Tulsyan of R3 Corporate Advisors, who are advising Darwin Group, said that the group is quite positive on the resolution of Lavasa. “As their advisors, we have tried to understand the complexities and innumerable hurdles of the project mainly related to Environmental Clearances and MahaRERA. Homebuyers are the biggest sufferers here, besides the secured financial creditors. Keeping that in mind, we have prepared and submitted a very balanced plan. We are hopeful Lavasa will see a successful resolution this time. Liquidation won’t be the right thing for this asset, that’s what we believe,” Tulsyan told TOI. When contacted, Purusharth Singh, partner at Dhir and Dhir Associates, shared the following statement by Srishti and Madhav Dhir, the resolution applicants, “We recognize the residents of Lavasa City as the primary stakeholders in the entire resolution process and we truly believe that our resolution plan will give due credence to the plight and effort of the residents and aims at maximization of value for all other stakeholders, especially financial creditors. We are also confident that with the combined efforts of the residents, backed by meticulous planning that has gone into the preparation of our resolution plan, we will be able to surmount all challenges especially those related to environmental clearances and the city shall reclaim its vibrant character.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/lavasa-residents-count-on-final-bid-decision-for-pending-project/articleshow/85912224.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Moreover, the UD department has also given its nod for various development projects in the city ranging from relaxation in norms for construction in gaothan (old city) area, new direct pipeline from Darana dam to Nashik Road in line with direct pipeline from the Mukane dam and offline submission and permission to building plans for next few months until the online process get streamlined. Urban Development minister Eknath Shinde had a virtual meeting with the civic administration on Friday. Some Sena corporators, including leader of the opposition in the civic body Ajay Boraste, city Shiv Sena president Sudhakar Badgujar, were also present in the meeting that was held in Mumbai. Boraste said development of slums in the city had been affected during the past few years. “But the minister W has given his approval for implementation of the slum rehabilitation scheme in the city. Currently, there is a condition of minimum 4,000 sqmt for development of gaothan area. But we asked the minister to reduce the condition up to 1,000 sqmt to boost the development of gaothan areas. The minister has directed the civic administration to submit a proposal in this connection to the state UD department” he said. Last year, the state government had taken the decision to make the civic bodies in the state to lease out its properties at 8% of the Ready Reckoner (RR) rate. During the meeting, Sena corporators urged the minister to reduce it to 2.5% of the RR rate for registered social outfits. The minister said the amendment will be made in the present lease norms for the civic bodies in the state. “The minister also directed the civic administration to prepare a Detailed Project Report (DPR) for direct pipeline from Darna dam to Nashik Road that will sort out the water issue of the Nashik Road division of the NMC,” said Boraste.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/state-government-gives-nod-to-nashik-city-slum-redevelopment/articleshow/85907315.cms||Tushar Pawar

The project cost of the flyovers is pegged at Rs 245 crore. But the contractors of the project recently had sent a letter to the Public Works Department (PWD) of the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC), asking for a hike in the project cost by additional Rs 45 crore on the grounds of using M60 grade cement concrete material instead of using M40. The PWD had refused the demand but the contractors have again sent a letter to the PWD on the issue. A top NMC official said the contractor have hiked the project cost on the plea using a different kind of cement concrete, which he claimed would make the flyovers more sturdy and increase the lifespan of the flyovers. “We will seek guidance from IIT, Bombay, for technical aspects of the flyovers — including the use of the cement concrete for the constructions of flyovers — and about the increase in the lifespan of the flyovers,” said the official. “If the lifespan increases by 15-20 years, then we will take a call on increasing the project cost,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-to-seek-iit-bombays-assistance-for-2-flyovers/articleshow/85907296.cms||Tushar Pawar

The special court for Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) cases had earlier extended the custody of the accused, Girish Chaudhari, whose father-in-law is NCP leader Eknath Khadse. Chaudhari was arrested over charges in connection with the alleged Bhosari land deal. Earlier, the agency had booked Khadse, his wife, Chaudhari and owner of a land in the case. The ED counsel Hiten Venegaonkar opposing the bail argued that Chaudhari had knowingly purchased a property belonging to MIDC with the ulterior motive of using his father-in-law’s office to get compensation worth Rs 500 crore. The ED had registered an Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) last October against the former state revenue minister in connection with the alleged 2016 land deal. The ED case was based on an FIR filed by Maharashtra Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) against the Khadse family in 2017. The ACB had later closed the case, but ED continued its investigation. Chadhari’s counsel Mohan Tekavde, who argued for his bail on merits of the case, later said he would study the order and decide on the next legal step to be taken.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-special-court-rejects-bail-plea-of-ex-bjp-netas-kin/articleshow/85914029.cms||Swati Deshpande

District town planner (DTP) Priyam Bhardwaj issued a warning to the effect after undertaking demolition of illegal structures at three sites in Kalka on Friday. Bhardwaj said, “Illegally constructing any structure without obtaining CLU from the department calls for registration of FIR against the builder and he may be imprisoned for three years for violation of the Urban Area Act, 1975. We have been issuing warnings to such builders time and again.” She said the demolition drive was conducted in three areas of Kalka under the supervision of Kalka duty magistrate Vikram Singla. The first demolition was undertaken at Madanwala village, where illegal constructions were razed on around one acre of government land. At Sito Majra village, illegal construction on 1.5 acres of government land was cleared and illegal sheds were demolished at Karnpur and Grida villages. Bhardwaj said that such structures had been built by property dealers luring land owners to either construct colonies illegally or by selling land to people and asking them to construct their houses.

He was speaking at a webinar on ‘Sustainable mobility and public transport’ organised by BMC, WRI India, C-40 cities and hosted by NGO Waatavaran and Climate Voices. Datar, who along with other experts met BEST general manager Lokesh Chandra a day earlier, suggested that parking of cars and two-wheelers should be allowed below flyovers between CSMT and Sion, and e-buses should be allowed use of one lane exclusively once its population goes up. “There will be around 200 e-buses continuously moving on the dedicated lane with good frequency during peak hours, which will encourage more people to leave private cars and bikes at home and travel by buses,” he said. On the push for electric vehicles (EVs), Maxson Lewis, managing director of Magenta–ChargeGrid, said, “Even if 10% of transport was to transition to EV, the amount of charging stations that would be required would be so huge... We need charging lots in a city where there aren’t enough parking lots. It requires an ecosystem, participation among multiple entities the utility companies, parking, charging companies and transport authorities.” Shashank Rao of Mumbai Autorickshawmen’s Union said, “When talking of a sustainable transport system, we need to consider the principal of sustainable living too. The sustainability goal is good, but if the goal is achieved without keeping in mind how livelihoods (autorickshaw drivers) are going to get affected, it is of no good.” Electric vehicles are welcome, but unless private vehicles are restricted, Mumbai’s transport issue will not be resolved, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-have-spl-lane-for-e-buses-to-ease-commute-experts/articleshow/85914034.cms||Somit Sen

But corona cases are multiplying in Kerala and even in Maharashtra there is a slight increase. So we need to be careful and not put the children’s life at risk,” he said.Though the schools in rural areas where Covid-19 cases are minimal could reopen, those in cities were closed for over one and half years since March 2020, when the first lockdown was announced. Even in rural parts, classes of Std VIII-XII were allowed to resume while following strict Covid-19 protocol as set by the government.On Wednesday, school education minister Varsha Gaikwad had clarified that physical classes were unlikely to restart soon due to the rising number of cases.As per sources from the school education department here, both ministers would be meeting with the paediatric task force constituted by the government in this regard soon, after which the decision would be finalized.The panel had already suggested some changes like vaccinating both teaching and non-teaching staff with two doses before resuming physical classes.

No less than 107 languages are spoken in Bengaluru, including 22 scheduled and 84 non-scheduled languages. The other districts where more than 100 languages are spoken are Dimapur of Nagaland (103) and Sonitpur of Assam (101), says the analysis by Shamika Ravi, a non-resident senior fellow of Brookings Institution, and Mudit Kapoor, an associate professor of economics at Indian Statistical Institute.  The least diverse districts include Yanam (Puducherry), Kaimur (Bhabua, Bihar), Kaushambi and Kanpur Dehat (Uttar Pradesh) and Ariyalur (Tamil Nadu). In these districts, less than 20 languages are spoken.In Bengaluru, the total percentage of people who speak Kannada is 44%. The other major languages include Tamil (15%), Telugu (14%), Urdu (12%), Hindi (6%), Malayalam (3%), Marathi (2%), Konkani (0.6%), Bengali (0.6%) and Odia (0.5%). Languages like Pochury, Kondh, Sangtam and Wancho have the least number of speakers. The authors point out that the census covers all languages irrespective of the size of the population that speaks it. The linguistic diversity refers to mobility and, in turn, economic outcomes. “Mobility is a good marker for economic dynamism... Language is a good proxy for talent. When people speaking very different languages are coming to one place, the driving force is economy and job opportunities. The language tree for Bengaluru shows there are people from far and wide,” said Shamika Ravi. She also pointed out that while 100-plus languages is a lot, melting pots like New York feature 600-plus languages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/107-languages-spoken-in-bengaluru-district-highest-in-india/articleshow/85915872.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas

---||Pune||Admissions to PG, other Savitribai Phule Pune University courses from Monday||PUNE: Officials of the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) said almost all the merit lists for admission to various courses for the academic year 2021-22 will be declared by Friday evening after many students complained about the delay. The admission process, which will be completed online at this juncture, will also begin from Monday. The entrance examination results were declared by the university last month, but there was a delay in uploading merit lists, due to technical and administrative reasons, N S Umarani, pro-vice-chancellor at SPPU, said. While an earlier notification had mentioned that the merit list will be announced from August 14 onwards, a notification on August 20 again said that the entire process has been postponed. After this, there was no communication about the merit list from the university, causing much confusion among students who were waiting for the admission process to begin as soon as the results of all entrance examinations were out. NS Umarani said, “There were some technical and administrative problems due to which the merit lists of many courses could not be displayed on time. However, a majority of the merit lists will be declared by Friday night barring two or three courses. The admission process will be completely online and will begin by Monday.” This year also all the document submission and verification should be done in the online mode only. The admission of the student is subject to the submission of the hard copy of their valid documents when the offline session begins or as demanded by the department concerned, said a notification. A student who had applied for MA in politics and public administration, as well as a diploma course in gender studies, said, “The university has released a new notification stating that merit lists have been uploaded but the list of courses is the same as the ones uploaded on August 15 and 17.  There is no communication about the merit lists. I have only applied to this university, but those who have applied to multiple places will be forced to pay the fees there because of the delay here. I am hoping that by Friday night, all lists will be out.” Kamalakar Shete, a student activist, said the delay was affecting students who are unable to decide whether to wait for SPPU to declare the merit list or take admission wherever they get admission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/admissions-to-pg-other-sppu-courses-from-mon/articleshow/85912416.cms||Ardhra Nair

Also, Union minister Nitin Gadkari wrote to the chief minister about Shiv Sena MLAs threatening road contractors working on national highway projects,” said MLA Atul Bhatkalkar, the party’s in-charge for BMC polls. He said the chief minister has not taken cognisance of the complaints.

---||Nagpur||State seeks report on age of trees PWD cut for road widening||Nagpur: The state environment and climate change ministry headed by Aaditya Thackeray has sought a detailed report from the Akola forest division on the age of over 153 huge trees that were felled for road widening by the PWD under the jurisdiction of Akot Municipal Council (AMC). On August 21, 2021, TOI had reported quoting chief officer of AMC Shrikrishna Wahurwagh granting permission on August 4 to fell over 60-year-old 153 huge trees. These trees were felled after the amended Maharashtra (Urban Areas) Preservation & Protection of Trees Act, 1975, came into force. Talking to TOI, Thackeray had promised to look into the issue. The amended Act mandates declaring 50-year-old as ‘heritage’ trees to increase forest and tree cover, and if at all these trees are allowed to be cut, the project proponent has to plant trees equal to the age of the felled ones. Besides, if any project involves the felling of 200 and more trees then such proposals are to be sent to the state-level committee. Manisha Mhaiskar, principal secretary, environment department, Maharashtra, told TOI that the state government has taken a serious note of the issue. “On August 24, the environment ministry has written to the Akola district collector after greens raised the issue about the alleged violation of amended Maharashtra (Urban Areas) Preservation & Protection of Trees Act, 1975,” said Mhaiskar. Mhaiskar said , a detailed report has been sought on the age of over 153 trees that were felled for road widening. “On Friday, we have also sent a reminder to submit the report immediately. It will be against the law if the municipal council granted permission to fell the trees when amended law had been in force,” she said. The senior bureaucrat added that the state cabinet had approved the amendments in July itself. “We are waiting for the report from the district collector,” she said. Akola deputy conservator (DyCF) Arjuna KR said he has asked the RFO concerned to submit a detailed report. As per the letter, the forest officials were supposed to submit the report by August 31 to the district collector, but it has not been submitted yet. Wahurwagh said that he was not aware of the new amendments. “When I was told about it by green activist Shrikant Deshpande, the tree felling was stopped. Still, 67 huge trees remain to be felled,” he said. However, green activist Sheikh Munna Sheikh, president, Sarpamitra Nisarga Savwardhan Bahuuddeshia Sanstha, Akola, who first raised the issue, said, “If trees on farm fences are considered, the number of trees that will need to be felled will go up to over 200.” Though the damage has already been done, said Sheikh, the forest department should be transparent in calculating the age of the trees from the stumps at the spot. Deshpande said it is an irony that the chief officer, who heads the municipal council, is himself ignorant about the laws which he is supposed to implement. “The decision on amending the Act was taken in July but still, the chief officer granted permission to fell trees on August 4. Action should be taken against him,” said Deshpande.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/state-seeks-report-on-age-of-trees-pwd-cut-for-road-widening/articleshow/85909984.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

The work relating to laying of optical fiber lines in these villages has been completed,” Pune Zilla Parishad CEO Ayush Prasad told TOI. “We have decided to implement several initiatives and welfare programmes online for better public outreach. We will be able to implement our programmes effectively and achieve the desired results soon,” he added. “In Pune district, Bharatnet has provided 1,650 internet connections in 849 gram panchayats as of now. Several efforts are being undertaken, in coordination with the district administration, to increase the number of connections to minimum five government institutions in every gram panchayat. Also, Wi-Fi hotspots have been installed in 831 gram panchayats of which only 87 are commissioned. Now, directions have been issued to the concerned agency to commission hotspots in each gram panchayat within a month,” MC Sathish Kumar, joint controller of Maharashtra and Goa circle, ministry of communication, said. The work was severely affected due to the pandemic, he added. “Positively, the optical fiber cable has been laid in these gram panchayats and made service ready. The installation of equipment connections and other works is underway. So, we are confident to increase the internet utilisation in a month in these gram panchayats,” Speed is a vital factor in proper utilisation of Bharatnet. Through the connection, customers will get maximum up to 10 mbps internet speed in the early stage, he said. “There are multiple government programmes being implemented via the internet these days. Rural-based institutions can utilise Bharatnet to run its digital operations smoothly,” said Prasad. “The initiative can help provide various services like e-health, e-governance, e-education, e-banking, etc. The utilisation of Bharatnet can be increased by creating public awareness and it can be done with active participation of gram panchayats, Zilla Parishad and district administration so the benefit of the scheme can be reaped by rural masses,” said Anil Salunkhe, controller of Maharashtra and Goa circle, ministry of communication.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/wi-fi-networks-to-come-up-in-849-gram-panchayats/articleshow/85912458.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Kochi||SC stays Kerala government's plan to conduct Plus One exam||KOCHI: The Supreme Court, on Friday, stayed Kerala government’s decision to conduct offline Plus One exams as the state is reporting a lot of fresh Covid cases each day. The general education department had decided to conduct Plus One board exams from September 6 and model exams are currently happening online. The decision is a big relief for parents and students who were concerned about the offline exam amid the pandemic. In an oral observation, an SC bench led by Justice AM Khanwilkar slammed the government for not considering the safety of students by proceeding with offline mode of examination when the pandemic situation in the state had not abated. The court stressed on the fact that around three lakh students will take the exam offline, scheduled to be held till September 27, amid the pandemic. The government has been barred from conducting the examination until September13 as the stay is for a week. “There is an alarming situation in Kerala as the state accounts for more than 70% of cases of the country with more than 30,000 daily cases. Children of tender age cannot be exposed to risk,” the SC observed while considering a special leave petition filed by one A Rasool Shan, represented by advocate Prashant Padmanabhan, challenging the decision of Kerala High Court that refused to interfere with the decision to conduct offline exams. The counsel for the state government submitted that exams will be held after taking all requisite safety measures and adhering to protocols. The counsel even referred to SSLC and Plus Two exams in April and entrance exams in July ‘safely conducted’ by the government amid the pandemic. However, SC observed that the response from the counsel representing the state was unsatisfactory. The court’s decision comes amid wide criticism from teachers and parents on the government’s decision to conduct exams. On Thursday, general education minister V Sivankutty had launched a statewide cleaning and sanitization drive of Plus One exam centres. Aided Higher Secondary Teachers Association general secretary S Manoj said the apex court’s decision was a befitting reply to the arrogance of the state government to hold exams without considering the pandemic situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/sc-stays-government-plan-to-conduct-plus-one-exam/articleshow/85910110.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Bombay HC notice to govt on book sale as essential service||MUMBAI: Bombay high court on Friday issued notice to the Centre and State on a plea to include sale of books as an essential service in view of Covid-19 curbs. A bench of Justices K K Tated and Prithviraj Chavan heard a petition filed in April by Marathi Prakashak Parishad, a Pune-based association of Marathi publishers, to direct the Centre “to add sale of books as an essential service” under the Essential Services Maintenance Act, 1968. The petition says the lockdown severely affected book publishing in Marathi and other languages. “Everyone cannot afford laptops, smart phones, “books are the source of getting education, knowledge, wisdom, entertainment,” it adds. At a time when lockdown-like situations have increased mental health issues, books would “provide great help to people living in anxiety,” it says. The petition informs that in response to the lockdown, publishers in the US started a #BooksAreEssential campaign online in April 2020 which was picked up across the world. In India, the Kerala government took the initiative to consider books as an essential service. “The administration in Kerala has remained positive on the need for bookstores to open,” it states. The petition cites how parents in Pune faced difficulties in purchasing school books. Book shops are situated at Appa Balwant Chowk which is close to a containment area. “The shops were shut down,’’ it says, requesting HC to “consider such situations.” The Parishad has also urged that the State be directed to see if it can take a decision in the same manner as the Kerala government. Asked by the judges if the respondents – Centre and State - were present, the Parishad’s advocate Ajinkya Udane replied that the petition copy was served to them. The judges then directed issue of notice and posted the hearing after four weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-notice-to-govt-on-book-sale-as-essential-service/articleshow/85914058.cms||Rosy Sequeira

I have directed heads of all the sentinel sites to make sure that they send adequate number of samples for genome sequencing. I have also directed them update the real-time details on Indian SARS-Cov-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) surveillance module at the earliest,” Singh said. The letter comes in the wake of updated guidelines and SOPs for genomic surveillance of SARS-Cov-2 as it is crucial from a public health perspective to determine the incidence and prevalence of the Variants of Concern (VOC). “WGS is the only way to track any new kind of mutation and VOCs. I have directed the officials concerned to report the clinical findings of all such samples on a regular basis on the surveillance module so that outcomes can be used for epidemiological findings,” Singh said. As per state health department records, 917 RT-PCR samples have been sent to ILS between March 28 and August 5 for WGS, of which 426 have been detected as VOC. The VOC detected in Jharkhand include various mutants of Delta, Kappa and Alpha, along with 40 other variants. The health department’s guidelines state that over 1,200 Covid samples should have been sent for WGS between March 28 and August 5 from all the eight sentinel sites. Each sentinel site has to send 30 samples per month for WGS. In addition to this, 60 random positive samples with a CT value of 25 and less also need to be sent. The sentinel site in-charges said that they are trying to do their best in sending the samples but with the rate of Covid testing going down, they aren’t getting the required number of samples. A microbiologist attached with a sentinel site in Ranchi on condition of anonymity said, “As testing rate has gone down since infections have reduced, we aren’t getting a sample which has a CT value of equal to and less than 25.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/send-more-samples-for-genome-sequencing-health-secretary/articleshow/85909920.cms||Gaurav Pandey

Speaking to journalists after wrapping up his three-day visit to the state, Saikia claimed BJP leaders will rise up in an organized manner and will soon orchestrate mega protests to condemn the ‘anti-people’ policies of the state. “There is a narrative being spread by the incumbent government that the Union government is not providing funds to the state, which is not true. Our leaders and karyakartas are being harassed mentally and physically. The law and order situation has worsened and crimes against women are on the rise. All the good work done by the erstwhile Raghubar Das government has been reversed within two years,” Saikia said. Saikia said that the party has drafted a future course of action to strengthen its booths, shakti kendras, mandals and district units by December 25 of this year. Saikia also replied to AICC’s Jharkhand in-charge RPN Singh’s claims that the Das government had built a land bank in the state by forcefully usurping the land of poor farmers. “I challenge him to prove that the previous government forcefully usurped even a tiny patch of land,” he said. BJP’s state president Deepak Prakash also sharpened his attack on the Congress camp after Singh’s remarks on the new state employment regulations. “The regulations were passed by the state cabinet. What were the Congress ministers doing when the regulations were brought up for deliberations? The cabinet ministers from Congress should resign from their posts,” Prakash said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/govt-harassing-bjp-leaders-mentally-physically-saikia/articleshow/85909331.cms||Dhritiman Ray

He claimed that as per the order of the Supreme Court and the notification of revenue department of state government, he and his family were eligible to get the land under the Land Ceiling Act. “Few years back Mamlatdar Jadeja had demanded a bribe of Rs 10 crore from me.

---||Ranchi||BJP abstains from obituary reference on Day 1 of monsoon session||Ranchi: Opposition BJP, in deviation from officials protocols, did not take part in the obituary reference on the first day of the monsoon session which began on Friday. BJP’s non-participation in the event was a first by an opposition party in the history of the Jharkhand assembly. The list of people who were condoled by the House was also by far the longest with over three dozen names of prominent people from the socio-political field, hundreds of healthcare workers and policemen, all those who have died of the virus and victims of the Chamoli cloudburst. They died during the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic since the end of the budget session in March this year. As members of the House assembled, BJP’s chief whip Biranchi Narayan started reading out the obituary remarks as he had done during the previous session. He was, however, stopped by his party colleagues who demanded that Babulal Marandi be allowed to read them out as the party has elected him as their legislative party leader, who automatically should become the leader of the opposition in the House. Interrupting Narayan, BJP legislator Bhanu Pratap Shahi raised slogans against speaker Ravindra Nath Mahto asking him to recognise Marandi as the leader of the opposition. He was soon joined by other BJP MLAs but Mahto remained unfazed. Talking to media persons later, Narayan accused the government of not giving due respect to legislative processes. “When we have elected Babulal ji as the legislative party leader, he should be called by the speaker as the leader of the opposition as we are the largest opposition party to read out the obituary remarks. But he called the chief whip of the party,” Narayan said. He added, “We have been waiting for the speaker to recognise Babulal ji but now its high time that all such legislative responsibilities, expected from the leader of the opposition, should be carried out by him (Marandi).” However, both the ruling and other opposition parties criticised BJP for the manner in which it took up the protest. The speaker said, “This matter (obituary reference) should be kept beyond petty politics. Today, we are paying tribute to the departed souls, tomorrow, someone else would be reading out the obituary for us,” Mahto said. BJP’s ally Ajsu-Party president Sudesh Mahto supported the saffron party for raising the issue of Marandi but said the protest was ill-timed. “We all have an entire session to express our grievances and put the ruling party in the dock by raising questions but the commotion during the condolence motion could have been avoided,” he said. Meanwhile, the speaker named former UP chief minister Kalyan Singh, legislators Simon Marandi, Dukha Bhagat, Laxman Gilua, Rajendra Singh Munda, Vishnu Bhaia, Duti Pahan, Niel Tirkey, sportsperson Milkha Singh, actor Dilip Kumar, author Narendra Kohli, educationist Girdhari Ram Gonjhu and several others in his obituary. He also prayed for eternal peace for those who died in Chamoli cloudburst and mentioned the frontline Covid warriors, including 17 journalists and 28 policemen from the state who lost their lives. Chief minister Hemant Soren and legislative party leaders also read out their obituary remarks. Vinod Singh of CPIML urged the government to arrange for compensation to the dependents of frontline warriors who died during the pandemic and said such a move would be the real tribute to the department souls. Independent MLA Saryu Rai said this was the longest list of persons who died within five months since the conclusion of the last session. “It is painful and unfortunate that we have lost nearly three dozen political leaders and several eminent persons during the pandemic. We wish all strength to their family members,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bjp-abstains-from-obituary-reference-on-day-1-of-monsoon-session/articleshow/85911415.cms||Jaideep Deogharia
---||Jamshedpur||Jharkhand: Syllabus of govt schools for ’21-22 session reduced by 25%||RANCHI: The state education department has finalized the reduced syllabus for Class I to Class XII students of government schools for the 2021-22 academic session because of the Covid pandemic. The new syllabus prepared by the Jharkhand Council for Educational Research and Training has reduced study material by almost 25%. Many chapters in various subjects have been removed while several sub-sections of chapters have been dropped. For instance, in the Class IX syllabus for Hindi, several chapters have been omitted but the grammar part has been kept intact. Several sub-sections of mathematics of Class IX and X have also been dropped. In junior classes, the long stories and the ones which are difficult to read and understand have been omitted. Council sources said topics that have been taught earlier or will be taken up in later classes have been removed. “Unnecessary” portions of subjects have also been curtailed. The reduction in syllabus comes in the aftermath of a disruption of study in government schools during the current academic session because of the pandemic. So far, the regular classes for students in Class I to class VIII have not taken place even though over one-third of the session is over. However, classes for students of Class IX to XII are underway amid restrictions since the early part of August. Last year the syllabus was reduced by 40%. Commenting on the issue, regional deputy director (education) A V Bilung said, “The revised syllabus will be circulated among the schools. The study and related activities would take place according to the new course.” It may be stated here that the department will be holding mid-term examinations in November and December while the annual examination will be conducted in March and April. The examinations to be held by the end of the calendar year will comprise objective type questions. Education secretary Rajesh Sharma had earlier said in case the annual examination scheduled in March or April does not take place due to Covid, the results of tests held in November would be the basis of determining the performance of students. Meanwhile, the government is also conducting monthly tests in all schools. A school principal said, “The records of monthly examinations may also be the basis of future assessments but there have been no clear-cut instructions from the government in this regard.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/syllabus-of-govt-schools-for-21-22-session-reduced-by-25/articleshow/85917171.cms||Sanjay Sahay
---||Vadodara||Four from Noida, Gurugram cheat Dahod farmer||VADODARA: Four persons were held from Noida and Gurugram in connection with a fraud promising high rent for a 4G mobile phone tower to a farmer in Dahod. Those arrested include Niraj Attarsingh, Sunny Tomar, Anish Saifi and Kishankumar Das. Two other accused — Raj Harisingh and Manojkumar Sharma are yet to be arrested. The accused had contacted the farmer from Charchoda village in Garbada taluka of Dahod district over SMS. They used to buy bulk messaging packs online and sent messages to several persons. The farmer Raju Bhabhor contacted the accused who made a bogus agreement with him. The entire procedure was conducted online. During the process, the farmer was also asked to pay money. In all, the accused took Rs 19,60,600 in seven different accounts in over two years. When Bhabhor realised that he had been cheated, he registered an offence against the accused at the Panchmahal-Godhra Range cybercrime police station. The police traced the accused to Delhi and Noida. Tomar has three offences registered against him earlier including two with the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)and one with the Uttar Pradesh police.

---||Ranchi||Congress to push JMM on delivering poll promises||Ranchi: The AICC’s Jharkhand in-charge, RPN Singh, on Friday indicated that the state Congress will now begin pushing its ally Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) to implement the promises which the Grand Old Party made to the state’s electorate in its 2019 assembly election manifesto. A day after he jointly chaired a meeting of the UPA MLAs, along with chief minister Hemant Soren, before the commencement of the monsoon session, Singh urged JMM and all like-minded parties to create a consensus and push its promise of providing 27% job reservation under the OBC quota. “We have fulfilled our poll promise of waiving off farming loans, but there are several promises which we still need to fulfil in the coming days,” Singh said. He added that his party will now push the government in dismantling the land bank which was set up by the erstwhile Raghubar Das government and return the unused land to their rightful owners. “Displacement is also a major issue here. We will also urge the government to set up a displacement commission in order to fast track the disposal of pending matters,” he claimed. Singh also said that the Congress party has raised several objections to the new state recruitment policy. “Our state chief (Rajesh Thakur) and CLP leader (Alamgir Alam) will soon meet the CM and apprise him of our objections,” Singh said. Singh also announced that the Congress party will hit the streets in protest if the incumbent government glosses over complaints of corruption against bureaucrats and other officials. This was Singh’s first media interaction since the AICC appointed a new state president and four working presidents last month. Singh told TOI that former state chief, Rameshwar Oraon, was replaced as his duties as the state’s finance minister violated the party’s self-adopted playbook where one person would have one post. “The new Jharkhand Pradesh Congress Committee leadership has been tasked with strengthening the party’s organizations at the grass root levels. The president and working presidents will have to visit every block and district and boost the morale of our karyakartas,” he said. However, Singh's visit to the party's state headquarters in Shraddhanand Road triggered protests by a section of party workers as they raised slogans and burned his effigy, claiming that he had wrongly deposed Oraon from the post of state president and appointed Thakur for vested interests. Singh, however, did not react to the protests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/congress-to-push-jmm-on-delivering-poll-promises/articleshow/85909202.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||Ranchi||Cong MLA Irfan lauds Taliban takeover of Af, faces criticism||Ranchi: Two-term Congress MLA from Jamtara, Irfan Ansari, on Friday praised the Taliban for taking over Afghanistan and termed it as an end of the US “exploitation”. He, however, was quick to add that the Taliban are terrorists. The grand old party has distanced itself from Ansari’s statement, terming it as his personal comment and urged all party men to follow guidelines on international affairs. BJP fumed over the statement and called it a reflection of Congress’s “Talibani mentality”. Known for making controversial statements, Ansari told reporters after coming out of the first day of the monsoon session of the assembly that the people of Afghanistan and the Taliban are happy over the developments in their country. When asked to explain the reason for his appreciation of the Taliban, Ansari claimed, “They are terrorists but they have helped Afghanistan free from the US military.” The Congress MLA further said, “I stand with the oppressed people and the fact is that people in Afghanistan were being tortured by the US military all these years. The US troops have not spared mothers, sisters and even children. So, the locals are now happy and I appreciate it.” Asked if he approves the current governance model in Afghanistan, Ansari said he was “too little” to comment on it. He, however, claimed that whatever news is being presented before the masses about the situation in Afghanistan is false. “Earlier, they (Taliban) pushed out the British forces and now, the Americans. There must be peace in Afghanistan now,” he said. Reacting to Ansari’s comments, newly-appointed state present of the party, Rajesh Thakur, said the statement should not be considered as a stand of the Congress party. “Only the party’s central leadership is authorised to issue comments on international affairs and it is expected from all party workers to follow discipline,” he said, adding that the state unit would talk to Ansari for making such remarks. BJP, however, lambasted Congress for Ansari’s statement. The party’s chief whip, Biranchi Narayan, said, “It reflects the Congress’s Talibani mentality as it is the only party only which can appreciate the Taliban, identified as terrorists globally. Had the situation been peaceful there, hordes of people would not have been fleeing for their life and shelter.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cong-mla-irfan-lauds-taliban-takeover-of-af-faces-criticism/articleshow/85909159.cms||Jaideep Deogharia
---||Ranchi||Rims gears up to start renal transplants||Ranchi: The Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (Rims) is all set to become the 12th centre in the country to conduct renal transplants. Talking to reporters on Friday, Rims director Dr Kameshwar Prasad said: “We all have witnessed the increase in renal failures due to Covid-19 as the virus has adversely affected several vital human organs. As human organs aren’t something which can be procured or regenerated, we need to promote organ donation. Keeping all these in mind we are going to start kidney transplants at Rims soon.” Dr Prasad said they would require additional manpower for the transplant and have started the process to hire specialised surgeons for the purpose. Rims is also going to start a 25-bed dialysis unit within a month after which transplants will be started. As part of their efforts to start renal transplants, a State Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (SOTTO) has been established on the Rims campus. The college administration has already sent a proposal to the director-in-chief health services for approval. Talking to TOI, assistant professor of anatomy department, Dr Rajiv Ranjan, who has been made nodal officer for the programme, said: “With the establishment of SOTTO, we have started our journey towards first renal transplant at Rims. Once we get the required approval, as hospital management has already initiated the recruitment of required manpower, we will start the transplants.” Asked about SOTTO’s role, Dr Ranjan said, “Our aim is to disseminate the message of organ donation as well as make people aware of the importance of organ donation so that more lives could be saved. As Rims is the largest hospital, we can avail more and more organs through donation process.” Meanwhile, as part of the 36th national eye donation fortnight, Rims has planned to felicitate family members of 12 cornea donors on September 15. “The cornea transplant was started almost three decade ago at Rims. However, it couldn’t gain the momentum it was supposed to. Now, we have decided to make it a regular practice and we will be felicitating family members of cornea donors on September 15. I have instructed the doctors that cornea transplant should be done on a regular basis,” said Dr Prasad. Rims also announced a 24-hour pathology unit at the trauma centre which will be made functional by the end of this month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/rims-gears-up-to-start-renal-transplants/articleshow/85911498.cms||Gaurav Pandey

Addressing a press conference, TMC MP Sukhendu Sekhar Roy said, “The Centre has been using CBI, ED and other central agencies to harass CM Mamata Banerjee after her landslide victory in the assembly polls and because of her efforts to string together all the opposition forces to defeat BJP in 2024.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ed-summonses-lack-legal-sanctity-tmc/articleshow/85915930.cms||Mohua Chatterjee
---||Delhi||You'll get lassi, not malai, says Supreme Court to Amrapali buyers||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday told thousands of Amrapali homebuyers not to expect compensation for delay in getting possession of flats as the court is trying its best to protect their interest by somehow completing all the housing projects left in limbo by the promoters of the company. “You are getting lassi but do not expect malai over lassi," Justice U U Lalit said in a lighter vein to advocate M L Lahoty, who raised the issue of compensation as the homebuyers will be getting possession after an inordinate delay, which in some cases is around a decade. The court said it would amount o expecting too much from the court to get compensation along with possession. The bench of Justices Lalit and Ajay Rastogi said it is also not asking the homebuyers to pay penalty for delay in payment as many have stopped paying instalments for years and are still not doing so even after the construction of housing projects being done under the supervision of the court. "You are trying to draw some more benefits for homebuyers. But we cannot allow. We reject the plea. We are also not asking you to pay interest for default on the part of homebuyers. If we allow delay compensation to one homebuyer, then all will seek compensation," the bench said. The demand of compensation would further delay Amrapali projects as the court and the court-appointed receiver of the company are exploring various options to raise money just to complete the projects. Senior advocate R Venkataramani, who as a court-appointed receiver is managing the affairs of Amrapali group, also opposed the plea of homebuyers and said “to ask for compensation is too far-fetched”, which should not be allowed. As the court was informed that around 2,500 flats would be ready for possession by the end of this year if Rs 200 crore was made available to NBCC, the court directed that the buyers of those flats must clear their dues by October 15. It said that allotment of flats would be cancelled to those who fail to clear their dues and the flats would be auctioned. Venkatramani also informed the court that a public notice will be published in newspapers in the coming week for those flats which have so far remained unclaimed and if no one comes forward to claim them then those flats will be sold. "…it has emerged that 9,538 homebuyers have neither registered so far in the customer data mentioned by the office of the receiver, nor have made any payments, subsequent to the judgement of the Supreme Court in July 2019," the receiver had said in its report. He had also informed the bench that there are 6,210 homebuyers who are not making clearing their dues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/youll-get-lassi-not-malai-says-supreme-court-to-amrapali-buyers/articleshow/85915932.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary
---||Delhi||Citing fundamental right to protest, high court grants bail to 5 in northeast Delhi riots case||NEW DELHI: The right to protest and express dissent has a “fundamental stature” in a democracy, the Delhi high court said on Friday, granting bail to five accused, including a woman, in a northeast Delhi riots case. They are accused of being part of a mob that attacked policemen, resulting in injuries to head constable Ratan Lal, who later died of his wounds. In five separate but similar verdicts, the HC granted bail to accused Mohd Arif, Shadab Ahmad, Furkan, Suvaleen and Tabassum, who are facing prosecution for the murder of head constable Lal. It is to be noted that the right to protest and express dissent is a right which occupies a fundamental stature in a democratic polity, and therefore, the sole act of protesting should not be employed as a weapon to justify the incarceration of those who are exercising this right,” Justice Subramonium Prasad observed. While pointing out that all the accused have been behind bars for the past 12-18 months, the court underlined that “it is the constitutional duty of the court to ensure that there is no arbitrary deprivation of personal liberty in the face of excess of state power.” Furkan, Arif, Ahmad, Suvleen and Tabassum were arrested last year in April, March, May and October, respectively, and have been behind bars since then. Countering the claim of the police that all five had conspired to kill and attack police officers as part of a mob, the court said invoking murder charges on a crowd “cannot be done on the basis of vague evidence and general allegations.” It added that “when there is a crowd involved, at the juncture of grant or denial of bail, the court must hesitate before arriving at the conclusion that every member of the unlawful assembly inhabits a common intention to accomplish the unlawful common object. There cannot be an umbrella assumption of guilt on behalf of every accused by the court.” Opposing the bail plea, the police alleged that on February 24, 2020, at the behest of the organisers of the protest, a crowd carrying various weapons such as “lathis”, baseball bats, iron rods and stones convened at the main Wazirabad Road and refused to pay heed to the orders of senior officers and other cops. But the HC pointed to the evidence in each case and noted that in the case of Ahmad and Tabassum, merely being one of the organisers of the protest and being in touch with other participants was not sufficient to keep them in jail for an undefined period of time at this stage. Regarding the role of the woman accused, Tabassum, the HC noted there was no video footage showing her in the vicinity of the protest site, and the contention that a few women wearing burqas have been caught assaulting police officials in a video does not have any weight at this juncture as she cannot be identified in the clip. While granting bail to 18-year-old Suvaleen, the court said it would not be prudent to keep him behind bars for an undefined period at this stage and his continued incarceration with hardened criminals will only be detrimental.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/citing-fundamental-right-to-protest-high-court-grants-bail-to-5-in-northeast-delhi-riots-case/articleshow/85915967.cms||Abhinav Garg

A bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices Surya Kant and A S Bopanna told Jharkhand government counsel Kapil Sibal, “It is very unfortunate that another person has been appointed as DGP after the Supreme Court had issued notice on the PIL.” When Sibal said the DGP had been picked from the panel chosen by the UPSC, the bench said the panel was selected earlier and that the state government cannot keep that panel alive for eternity. Appearing for petitioner Rajesh Kumar, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi said the Hemant Soren government, after coming to office in December 2019, had transferred K N Chaubey from the post and effected appointment of others without following the SC-laid down procedure. Sibal said the state government has written six times to UPSC for a panel of names but UPSC has refused to do so saying since Jharkhand had apparently violated SC directions, the state should get an order from the Supreme Court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/jharkhand-attracts-adverse-comments/articleshow/85915976.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

On Friday, GFP president Kiran Kandolkar along with party members visited Lord Damodar temple to seek blessings. Kandolkar said that people are livid with the ruling party, and there is disenchantment within BJP, which is also because the party has sidelined Utpal, son of former CM Manohar Parrikar. “When Francis D'Souza’s son Joshua D'Souza could become an MLA, how could they have doubted the capability of Parrikar's son, “ he said. When asked whether GFP will offer a ticket to Cortalim MLA Alina Saldana if she is ignored by BJP, he said, “We were colleagues, and so we have been on good terms. She is a wonderful human being and has always raised her voice against wrong things.” The GFP president hinted that he will meet a few BJP functionaries who have expressed interest in joining GFP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/gfp-embarks-on-mormugao-tour/articleshow/85911000.cms||---
---||Goa||Despite multiple earning sources, expenses outweigh revenue for most municipalities||Panaji: Finances of the majority of the state’s municipal councils are a case of expenses exceeding revenue despite having multiple revenue sources. To blame, said an officer of the urban development department, is the huge outflow towards garbage management in recent years and the corresponding failure to collect arrears on time and hike taxes regularly.  In this regard, the Corporation of the City of Panaji’s (CCP) performance for the last three financial years has been slightly better compared to that of the other civic bodies who are yet to keep their expenses under control and enhance revenue. “No more can municipal bodies ignore waste generated in their respective jurisdictions. There is always the fear that a court may question them. Their expenditure towards waste management is huge compared to other expenses,” the officer told TOI. Most of the funds now go towards costs involved in engaging labour to collect and dispose waste, transportation of waste, and waste remediation, he said. “A few years ago, waste was not a big issue, but today it is. People will alert a civic body if they find litter or will post a photo on social media,” he said. It is not that their revenue collection is not decent, but some municipalities fail to collect it timely and subsequently face problems in collecting arrears, the officer said. While the outlays of municipal bodies have been growing, they have not hiked taxes for the past several years for fear of antagonising people. “Rental rates have not been raised since 2004,” the officer said. Another officer said councillors are not keen to initiate any measures that will up revenue even as their focus remains on bigger projects. “Attend a council meeting and watch how many of them ever discuss how to improve finances. But surely there will be noise if there’s a delay in receiving funds from the government,” he said. Even if a chief officer, who is answerable to various authorities, makes a suggestion to that effect, it is likely it will be thrown into a bin. “Functioning of civic bodies is governed by vote-bank politics. Even before any decision is implemented, they think about people’s reaction,” he said. Even as municipalities spend lakhs towards waste management, he said, no thought is given towards reducing this component of expenses though it is possible. Despite collecting garbage regularly, there will still be spots littered. Yet hardly are citizens fined even as a civic body has to invest additional resources to clean areas that have turned into habitual dumping spots, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/despite-multiple-earning-sources-expenses-outweigh-revenue-for-most-municipalities/articleshow/85911010.cms||Bindiya Chari
---||Chandigarh||Punjab and Haryana high court seeks Haryana reply on Karnal police lathicharge||CHANDIGARH: Hearing a plea seeking judicial probe headed by a retired judge of the high court into the ‘violent’ action of police on farmers in Karnal, the Punjab and Haryana high court on Friday asked the Haryana government to inform the court about the steps taken by it on the issue. The HC, however, was not inclined to issue notice to the state government on the issue and adjourned the matter, seeking a short reply from the state. When the matter came up for hearing before a division bench comprising Chief Justice Ravi Shanker Jha and Justice Arun Palli, Haryana advocate general Baldev Raj Mahajan informed that the chief secretary has already sought a report from the Karnal deputy commission and appropriate action would be taken after receiving it. Additional advocate general Deepak Balyan, who was assisting the AG in this matter, however, informed the bench that during the August 28 incident, 24 police officials had sustained bodily injuries. He stated that regarding injuries to cops, an FIR under various sections of the IPC, the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act 1984 and the National Highway Act has been registered at Madhuban police station. The investigation of the case is being done by a SIT headed by a DSP rank officer. The state counsel also informed the HC that since November 2020, farmer protesters, under the garb of peaceful protests, have been giving calls for statewide road blockage, causing undue misery and harassment to passengers. “The protesters have no respect for law because they intentionally blocked the NH-44 at Bastara toll plaza, knowing the fact that thousands of vehicles of commuters from different states would be stuck on both the sides of the Bastara toll plaza,” the state informed the HC during the hearing of the case. The bench was also informed that on August 28, Section 141 of CrPc was promulgated and duty magistrates also announced about the orders but the protesters defied them to assemble unlawfully near the toll plaza. The court was informed that there have been incidents in the past wherein police have faced challenges in ensuring safety and security of the elected representatives while respecting the sentiments of agitating farmers. The matter has reached before the HC in the wake of a plea filed by some injured farmers seeking judicial probe into the police action on farmers on August 28 in which several farmers had allegedly received brutal injuries. The petitioners have also pleaded for registration of FIRs and departmental action, on the conclusion of enquiry, against police officials and the SDM who were liable for giving orders to their subordinates to physically injure the farmers in the process of dispersing them. Directions have also been sought to look into the role of Karnal SDM Ayush Sinha, the young IAS officer who was seen in a video directing cops to smash the head of protesters, and other officers of civil and police administration Karnal. According to the plea, the state of aggression and violent behaviour of police was an outcome of illegal orders of the SDM. A DVD regarding a video clip of the SDM has also been attached with the petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hc-seeks-haryana-reply-on-karnal-police-lathicharge/articleshow/85913204.cms||---
---||Goa||Sudin holds ‘chai pe charcha’ with Lobo, Babush and Paliencar in city||Panaji: Meetings between senior leader of Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar, science and technology minister and BJP Calangute MLA Michael Lobo, Panaji BJP MLA Atanasio ‘Babush’ Monserrate and Goa Forward Party (GFP) Siolim MLA Vinod Paliencar on Friday has raised eyebrows in political circles. However, the MLAs tried to downplay the meeting claiming that it is merely “chai pe charcha”. A political observer said through such meetings the politicians are trying to understand the political equations in the state and that such “developments” will continue till nomination papers are filed to contest the next assembly elections. Assembly elections are scheduled early next year. For the past 10 years, BJP has been at the helm in the state. Stating that Goa has entered election mode, Dhavalikar said that those MLAs who are restless are meeting somebody or the other and that even those loyal to a particular party are doing the same to discuss how to go ahead. “Not only Paliencar, but today Babush and Lobo also met me. I cannot say that there was anything political. It was just chai pe charcha,” Dhavalikar said. The senior MGP leader said that his “party has been continuously represented in the state legislative assembly, right from the first election, and we have to hold such meetings”. Dhavalikar said that if a MLA is not safe, then too they need to gauge every political situation. “This type of discussion takes place. Those who think of leaving the party also hold such meetings and even those who feel that they will not get the party ticket,” he said. Lobo said that he had not met Dhavalikar for long and that it was only out of their mutual friendship that they met on Friday. “Politics is always there, and we might have discussed small things. We have to listen to each other to understand the political situation. He asked me about the political situation in Bardez and I tried to find out about the political situation in Ponda taluka as elections are near,” Lobo said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sudin-holds-chai-pe-charcha-with-lobo-babush-and-paliencar-in-city/articleshow/85911033.cms||---

A social worker from Cumbharjua constituency, Samil Volvoikar, also joined Congress later in the day. Rodrigues, a former CCP mayor, said he has joined the party as he felt he need to do something to improve the way Taleigao is evolving. Former mayor Uday Madkaikar, another close aide of Monserrate, is expected to join Congress on Saturday. In a bid to create a wave in favour of Congress, the party has lined up several inductions over the next few days. Reshma Karishetty, Gnyaneshwar Govekar, Karishma Mangeshkar and Shaikh Faiz also joined Congress. “In Panaji and Taleigao, people are upset with Monserrate and are looking for new options for the five constituencies of Tiswadi. The Monserrate family has captured Taleigao and Panaji and has made it their family property,” said state Congress president Girish Chodankar. The party has been in touch with various disgruntled elements within BJP and Babush camp for several months to try and swing things around in Santa Cruz, Taleigao and Panaji where Monserrate has significant heft. “At one time we were wondering how to even setup the Taleigao block. We need to strengthen Panaji too, and Uday Madkaikar is going to join us on Saturday,” Chodankar said. Though Chodankar made it clear that no tickets have been promised to the new entrants, Rodrigues made his intention clear to contest from Taleigao. “Every time Monserrate jumped, we jumped with him. Now we cannot tolerate it any more. If Congress gives me the chance to contest from Taleigao, I request voters to give me one term and I will do what the people of Taleigao want,” said Rodrigues. Chodankar said that he is in touch with many BJP cadre who are upset with the developments within the party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/babushs-ex-aides-join-cong-uday-likely-to-follow-suit/articleshow/85911096.cms||---
---||Goa||Mickky eyes Benaulim ticket, vows to wrest Fatorda for Cong||Margao: The simmering differences in Congress over the issue of forging alliance with Goa Forward Party has turned into a political potboiler in Fatorda with former Nuvem MLA Francisco Pacheco alias Mickky - relegated to the fringes of politics since his defeat in 2017 assembly polls in Nuvem - using the issue as a launchpad to announce his comeback plans. Addressing reporters on Friday, Pacheco, while declaring his intention of contesting Benaulim seat on the Congress ticket, vowed to also wrest the Fatorda seat for the party. “I had defeated Congress in 2002 and therefore it’s my bounden duty to win the seat back for the Congress. And as Fatorda lies adjacent to Benaulim, I have taken it upon myself to ensure a win for the Congress there,” Pacheco, who joined the Congress only recently, said. Pacheco won the Benaulim seat in 2002 contesting as a UGDP candidate defeating Churchill Alemao who contested as a Congress candidate. Congress hasn’t been able the win the seat since. However, Pacheco’s wild card entry into Congress hasn’t gone down well with a section of the Congress for his overt support to state party pesident Girish Chondankar. Pacheco had publicly voiced his opposition against the idea of Congress having any alliance with GFP and also against effecting a change of guard in the party. “For Mickky to get a Congress ticket he has to demonstrate his utility value for the party. Unlike other aspiring contenders for Congress ticket in Benaulim, Mickky feels he has significant influence in Fatorda, and he intends to leverage it in favour of the Congress. By pledging to wrest both Benaulim and Fatorda seats, Mickky is trying to browbeat Congress into giving him the party ticket,” a political commentator said.

They have deferred the decision on the position to be adopted vis-a-vis various political parties to September 8 as senior leaders of farm organisations were not present in the meeting at Singhu border on Friday. The farm groups have also taken strong note of the statement by SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal wherein he had indicated that the Akali Dal workers were capable of taking on nuisance creators, but avoided referring to farmers. The farmers have also asked farmers not to provide fards (revenue record) to the procurement agencies at the time of paddy procurement. The farm organisations asked the political parties to desist from getting into election mode so early if they are truly supportive of the farmer struggle. The early start of campaigning is perceived to be an anti-farmer conspiracy, to distract and divert attention from the crucial struggle of farmers. Farm leader Manjit Singh Rai alleged that Sukhbir Badal is trying to provoke farmers through his statements. "We challenge him that if we give a call, it will become tough for him to stand in Punjab. It seems that he is speaking with the underhand support from BJP and wants to spoil the peaceful atmosphere in Punjab. We want all political parties to stop rallies till the elections are announced." In the meanwhile, the activists of farm organisation BKU Krantikari and other outfits again assembled at the Moga grain market on Friday and held a protest against the lathicharge on farmers and demanded withdrawal of case against the farmers. Activist Lakha Sidhana, too, participated in the protest. ‘Attack unpardonable’ Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia in a tweet said that the brutal attack by police on farmers in Moga is unpardonable. Eerie silence of Sukhbir Badal, against whom the farmers were protesting and CM Captain Amarinder, to whom the police report, further vindicates that both of them are as much anti-farmer as the BJP government at the Centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/farm-groups-ask-pb-govt-to-withdraw-cases-by-sept-8-warn-of-stir-escalation/articleshow/85913313.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Goa||MoEF committee returns Vedanta’s expansion plan||Panaji: The expert appraisal committee (EAC) of the ministry of environment forest and climate change (MoEFCC) has returned the proposal of Vedanta Limited for upgradation of the blast furnaces (BF) to enhance the production capacity at Amona plant due to several issues. During the public hearing for the expansion of the plant, villagers around the vicinity strongly opposed the upgradation plans. Most of the attendees opposed the project expansion citing pollution, health, education and unemployment issues. The project proponent (PP) failed to submit a point-wise response to the issues raised at the public hearing, EAC said. “The committee recommended to return the proposal in its present form to address the shortcomings as enumerated. Further the project proponent is required to undertake necessary corrective action on the said non-compliances and latest compliance report on the same from the concerned regional office of MoEFCC is required. MoEFCC may issue a show cause notice to the PP for the non-compliance to the existing EC conditions as mentioned above,” EAC said The committee also observed that in the instant proposal, the units namely blast furnace (2,92,000 m3) and coke oven plant (3,20,000 TPA) are running on the strength of the CTE/CTO (consent to establish/ consent to operate) from Goa State Pollution Control Board (GSPCB). Besides the project proponent has obtained environment clearance (EC) during 2009 for the blast furnace – 9,00,000 tonnes per annum (TPA); sinter plant – 2,00,0000 TPA; coke oven plant – 6,00,000 TPA and power plant 60 MW based on waste heat recovery boilers (WHRB). However PP has not integrated these units till date. The environment impact assessment (EIA) report needs to be revised by integrating all the units and cumulative impact assessment needs to be carried out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/moef-committee-returns-vedantas-expansion-plan/articleshow/85911264.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Another family thrashed for practicing back magic||Chandrapur: Another family was brutally thrashed for practising black magic in Bhiwapur on Friday morning. The city police had initially registered a non-cognizable offence after victim Narayan Pademwar and his family members lodged a complaint. Social worker Bhushan Fuse and Andhashraddha Nirmulan Samiti’s office bearers Anil Dahegaonkar and Dhananjay Tadwade took up the matter with the cops in the evening. They questioned the men in khaki for dereliction of duty. PSO Sudhakar Ambore then took cognizance of the matter and dispatched a team which arrested 10 accused. Ambhore claimed that after the issue was brought to his notice, the FIR was rectified and an offence was registered. According to the FIR, four members of 50-year-old Narayan Pademwar’s family were thrashed by Narayan’s father Ashalu Pademwar, his brother Narshing and other members of the family on Friday morning. Narayan and Ramu are brothers. Ramu has been suffering from oral cancer since three months. However, instead of treating him, Ramu’s family moved from one god-man to another seeking remedy for his ailment. The god men and tantriks, however, told Nraayan that Ramu’s ailment was the outcome of the ‘black magic’ performed by people close to his family. Ramu’s family then started blaming Narayan’s family for the ailment. On Friday morning, Narayan and Ramu’s father Aashalu slapped Narayan at a tea stall at RK Square, charging him and his family of practicing back magic and causing cancer to Ramu. Soon, Narayan’s other brother Narsingh and nephew Sinnu Radadi came to spot and started beating him. As Narayan’s family members learnt about the scuffle, his daughters Arti, Puja and son Akash rushed to the spot. One Madhunbai Radadi and others joined the accused. Narayan along with his two daughters Arti and Puna and a minor son Akash were thrashed with sticks. Minor Akash was seriously injured on his face while Puja and Arti have suffered bruises. Social worker Fuse said that after two similar incidents in the recent past, the cops should have been more vigilant and taken action after the victim approached them for justice. “We have brought the anomaly to the notice of the police and they have rectified the FIR,” Dahegaonkar said. The process of registering an FIR under sections of the Anti Black Macig Act was under way at the time of going to the press. Earlier, seven members of two families were tied and brutally thrashed in village Wani (khurd) on August 21 by a mob for ‘practising witchcraft’. In another case, three members of a family in village Mindhala (Toli) were brutally thrased for similar reasons by five people on August 31.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/another-family-thrashed-for-practicing-back-magic/articleshow/85913371.cms||Mazhar Ali
---||Chandigarh||Punjab: Facing protests, Shiromani Akali Dal forms panel to talk to farmers||CHANDIGARH: After facing protests and even violence during its public meetings being held as part of the ‘Gal Punjab Di’ campaign, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Friday halted canvassing for six days. He also constituted a three-member committee to talk to farmer unions to offer support and to “remove any misunderstanding between them and the Akali Dal”. The ‘Gal Punjab Di’ campaign will now resume on September 11 from Amloh. Sukhbir also cautioned the people of the state against a “deep rooted conspiracy” by anti-Punjab, anti-farmer and anti-Sikh forces to vitiate the atmosphere of peace and communal harmony and engineer fratricidal bloodshed among Punjabis. He alleged that these forces were acting “at the behest of the central agencies and had the active support of the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)”. The SAD president claimed that the Congress and the AAP were acting out of sheer frustration over the rousing response of Punjabis to the ongoing campaign started by his party. “They have read the writing on the wall and want to scuttle the impending mandate of the people of Punjab by creating conditions of unrest and instability. All this was being done to create a justification for the imposition of the President’s rule and bring back the era of state repression of the 80s and the 90s in the state,” he alleged. The former deputy CM also claimed that the Congress and AAP had made teams to disrupt SAD functions. He distributed a list of “known Congress and AAP supporters who had disrupted SAD events at Samrala, Baghapurana and Moga” recently. He said Balwinder Singh Bhunder, Prem Singh Chandumajra and Manjinder Singh Sirsa of his party would talk to the farmers’ organisations to reiterate the party’s support to their movement and to eliminate any possibility of misunderstandings between the organisations and the party. “We are totally with the farmers’ movement and have been backing it to the hilt. We have also backed all calls given by the Sanyukt Morcha and will continue to do so. We are ready to answer each and every question posed by any of its representatives at any place. We do not want any confrontation with farmers,” he cleared.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sad-postpones-poll-campaign-to-talk-to-farmers/articleshow/85913405.cms||---
---||Goa||Only 50% ore finds takers at e-auction||Panaji: Only 50% of the iron ore found takers at the 26th e-auction conducted by the government on Tuesday to generate revenue for the state. A senior officer said that only 0.8 million tonnes were purchased out of 1.57 million tonnes put up for e-auction. Sources said that the tepid response was due to the low grade iron ore. The iron ore which was put up for auctioning was lying at various mines, plots and jetties including Pissurelem, Kotambi, Rivona, Navelim, Tudou, Pale, Uguem, Shigao, Sonus, Trimurthy, Cudmen, and Tollem. At the 25th e-auction conducted in March, only 70% of the ore lying at jetties and ports found takers. Around 1 million tonnes (of the 1.6 million tonnes) of ore was purchased. The state government has been conducting e-auctions of iron ore to generate revenue for the state treasury, which has been facing a crisis due to the Covid pandemic. Chief minister Pramod Sawant, in his budget speech, had said that the state would generate revenue of around Rs 500 crore from mining. In the recently concluded monsoon session of the legislative assembly, the House passed the Goa Mining Corporation Bill to restart mining activities in the state. The Bill is yet to receive the governor’s assent. Mining in Goa came to a halt in March 2018, following the decision of the Supreme Court to quash the second renewal of 88 mining leases. In July, SC dismissed the review petition filed by the state government seeking the operation of 88 mining leases cancelled in 2018.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/only-50-ore-finds-takers-at-e-auction/articleshow/85911336.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Chandigarh||Muzzafarnagar mahapanchayat will be a milestone in farm struggle, say farmers||Bathinda/Jind: Even as the farmers’ protest has intensified in Punjab with police resorting to lathicharge on protesters in Moga on Thursday, leading to expected rise in confrontation between peasants and political parties, the stage is set for another political fight in Uttar Pradesh. The farmers, while fighting a battle against the agriculture marketing laws, do not want to lag behind in supporting the war to be fought under the campaign of ‘Mission UP’. Farmers, aiming to put pressure on the Union government to concede to its demands of repealing the farm laws and enacting a law guaranteeing MSP on all crops, want the Muzaffarnagar show, where ‘Mission UP’ will be kickstarted, to be as a grand success. The ‘Kisan Mahapanchayat’ to be held on September 5 in Muzaffarnagar, Uttar Pradesh. According to farm groups over 25,000 farmers are expected to reach Muzaffarnagar on Sunday, with hundreds of buses leaving for the venue from various places in Punjab on Saturday. Over 2,000 farmers are expected to take trains from Amritsar, Jalandhar and Ludhiana in the wee hours of Sunday to reach Muzzafarnagar by 10.40am. Various farm organisations of Punjab have assigned duties to its district units to arrange buses and sensitise farmers about timings and stoppages of the trains for travel to Muzaffarnagar. They said Muzaffarnagar will prove to be a big milestone in the history of farm struggle, as it will be a nail in the coffin of BJP-led Uttar Pradesh government, which will force the central government to listen to the grievances of protesting farmers, who have already completed more than nine months at the borders of Delhi. “We have hired 150 buses as over 6,000 farmers, including 1,000 women, will reach Muzaffarnagar. All buses will be asked to stop at a given distance from Muzaffarnagar, from where the caravan will begin,” said Punjab’s biggest farm organisation BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokri Kalan. BKU (Ekta Dakaunda) general secretary Jagmohan Singh said, “Many of our activists will travel by trains from different locations.” Likewise, BKU Kadian president Harmeet Singh Kadian said nearly 2,000 activists will catch the super express train from Amritsar at 4am, from Jalandhar at 5am and Ludhiana at 6am. Farm bodies in Haryana claimed that lakhs of people are going to take part in this kisan rally to show the Manohar Lal Khattar-led government in the state and the Centre that the farmers’ community across the country is united. Farmers at village-level have arranged vehicles at their own expense to reach the venue. BKU activists have been visiting villages, asking people to take part in the event. Outfits in Bangar belt have issued route maps to farmers and asked to them carry churma and food while leaving early morning for the venue in UP. BKU (Charuni) Jind president Azad Singh Palwan, who has been staging a village chaupal seeking maximum mobilisation in Muzaffarnagar, said, “The kisan mahapanchayat will be held 170km from Jind district. People from Jind and nearby areas will leave in the early hours on September 5 while those in Sirsa district would leave a day early. The BJP-JJP government in Haryana has booked around 40,000 farmers in the state and has been lying that only Punjab farmers are agitating. This maha rally, going to be the world’s biggest ever, will open the eyes of Khattar and Dushyant (Chautala, Haryana deputy CM) that the entire farming community is standing firm from Day 1.” Sikkim Safa Kheri, Jind women wing in-charge, said, “We will prepare food before leaving for fellow farmers during the day time. Farmers will vaccinate the saffron government by holding this mega rally. We have developed all vaccines for this egoist government which is mum over the deaths of over 600 farmers and has closed eyes for the past nine months. BKU Haryana (Charuni) president Gurnam Singh Charuni said, “The biggest crowd from Haryana will take part in this kisan mahapanchayat along with other farmers to show that the wave against anti-black laws is running across the country. Moreover, this event will prepare the ground for the defeat of the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh in coming assembly polls.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/muzzafarnagar-mahapanchayat-will-be-a-milestone-in-farm-struggle-say-farmers/articleshow/85913500.cms||---
---||Vadodara||FSSAI to delist non-dairy ‘milk’ items||VADODARA: Soon, products like ‘soya milk’, ‘almond milk’, ‘pistachio milk’, ‘walnut milk’ and all its ilk in the current format will have to lose place in virtual shelves of e-commerce majors like Amazon, Big Basket, Grofers, Flipkart, Jio Mart among others. Reason? The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) — has asked all the e-commerce food business operators (FBOs) to delist all such products from their platforms that use dairy terminology for selling non-dairy or plant-based products by September 15. The significant move by the country’s food regulator comes in the wake of demands made by the National Cooperative Dairy Federation of India (NCDFI), the Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF) that markets brand Amul and other dairy co-operatives from across the country since last year to take action against those masquerading plant-based beverages/ products as milk and milk products. “It is directed to investigate the labelling declarations of such products which are reported to be in contravention to the regulatory provisions related to the application of dairy terms, including the specific instances of alleged violations as mentioned in the complaint and delist such products from your online platforms immediately,” FSSAI’s communique to e-commerce operators, e-commerce websites selling plant-based beverages, states. The e-commerce operators have also been asked to ensure that no such defaulting products are listed on their online platforms for sale in future as well. Further, they have been asked to share the action taken reports by the deadline, that is September 15. The order states that the ‘general standard for milk and milk products’ under the Food Safety and Standards (Food Products Standards and Food Additives) Regulations, 2011’ clearly lay down guidelines for use of dairy terms in the nomenclature of dairy products like milk, milk product or a composite milk product and non-dairy products (other foods). “As per these regulations, use of any dairy term for a product which is not milk, milk product or a composite milk product (eg plant based products/ beverages) is prohibited and any such action is in contravention of the said regulations,” the letter states. Exceptions have been allowed in nomenclature of products like coconut milk, peanut butter based on internationally accepted principle that dairy terms were being traditionally used in their nomenclature and such products are not substitutes for milk or its products. Similarly, curd is also not considered an exclusive dairy term in FSSAI regulations and relevant Codex standards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/delist-non-dairy-items-sold-as-milk-fssai-to-e-comm-firms/articleshow/85910547.cms||Prashant Rupera

---||Guwahati||Mizoram may get first judge in Gauhati HC||Among the 68 names cleared for appointment as HC judges by the SC collegium is Marli Vankung, who is the present Aizawl district judge and comes from the scheduled tribe community. If the government approves her appointment, she will be the first one, and a woman, to be appointed from Mizoram as a judge of Gauhati HC. Daughter of Brig C Vankunga, Marli Vankung did her LLB from Delhi University and MPhil from JNU before joining Mizoram judicial services. The collegium, comprising CJI Ramana and Justices U U Lalit and A M Khanwilkar, also cleared 3 other names, including two from the ST community — Vankung from Mizoram and advocate K Sema from Nagaland— recommended by the Gauhati HC as late as June 5, 2021, and which the SC collegium had received from the law ministry on August 16. Within 15 days, the SC collegium cleared the names for Gauhati HC. Overall, the collegium considered 113 names after intense deliberations spanning several days and found 68 suitable for being recommended for appointment to High Courts of Allahabad, Rajasthan, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Jammu and Kashmir, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Punjab and Haryana, Kerala, Chhattisgarh and Assam. The significance of recommending 68 names at one go can be gauged from the strenuousness characterising the exercise, which included scrutinising the antecedents of the candidates in the zone of consideration, their income and reputation and their attitudinal suitability for holding the constitutional posts. In contrast, from January to April this year, the collegium headed by then CJI S A Bobde and comprising Justices N V Ramana and R F Nariman in six different meetings could recommend names of only 46 persons for appointment as judges to nine HCs. Of the 68 names recommended by the collegium for appointment as HC judges, 44 are advocates and 24 are senior judicial officers in the district judge rank. The collegium has deferred consideration of 16 names awaiting further information on certain issues peculiar to each of them from the government or other authorities. Rest of the names were sent back to HC collegiums for reconsideration. The HCs have a cumulative pendency of nearly 60 lakh cases but are handicapped by 43% vacancy in judges post - against a sanctioned strength of 1089 judges, there are 465 vacancies. The three-member collegium led by CJI Ramana would have to work overtime in future to bring a semblance of normalcy in the working strength of judges in the HCs, which may require many more such mass-scale recommendations for appointment as HC judges. Most of the big high courts are plagued for long by large numbers of vacancies, which exceeded 50% in some cases. The biggest of them all, Allahabad HC has a sanctioned strength of 160 judges, but it has 68 posts vacant. The Calcutta HC with 72 sanctioned strength has 36 vacancies. As against the sanctioned strength of 94 of Bombay HC, it has 33 vacancies. Delhi HC has more than 50% vacancies as 31 of its 60 sanctioned posts of judges are vacant. One of the oldest high courts at Patna has a whopping 64% vacancy as 34 of 53 sanctioned posts of judges are vacant. Rajasthan HC has more than 50% vacancy as 27 of 50 posts of judges are vacant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/mizoram-may-get-1st-judge-in-gauhati-hc/articleshow/85916058.cms||---

To know about the components of an original forest and plant composition, one must go to a sacred grove, he said. He was speaking at ‘Forests and their People’ a webinar series as part of the Amche Mollem campaign comprising insightful talks on the unique connections the people of Goa have fostered with forests since prehistoric times. “Sacred groves, abodes of the gods, are uniquely Indian. They reflect human care and respect towards nature which has influenced us to protect certain patches of forests,” he said. “In the Bhagwan Mahavir Wildlife Sanctuary you can see nine settlements in and around the sanctuary area. People go to the forest for ritual needs, collection of resources, for daily requirements of medicine and wild fruit,” Datar said. Datar spoke about the interactions with local forest-dwellers that led to him documenting 720 species of flora in Mollem National Park and Bhagwan Mahavir Wildlife Sanctuary. He further said that he was told by indigenous forest-dwellers that more than 120-150 of the documented species were used in regular herbal medicine. He spoke about leafy vegetables playing an important role in their daily diet, especially during monsoon when fish is not available and during Shravan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/phd-scholar-highlights-unique-sacred-groves-of-mollem/articleshow/85911572.cms||---

Citing a 2008 judgment of a division bench, the first bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice P D Audikesavalu said there was nothing in the agamas or other religious scripts to prohibit Tamil mantras in temples. It refused to accept PILpetitioner, Rangarajan Narashiman’s contention that the state was altering practices of Hindu religious institutions in temples. It is the devotees’ choice to seek for archanas to be performed as per their wishes by chanting mantras either in Tamil or in Sanskrit, it said. “Judicial discipline commands that when an issue has been decided, unless the circumstances have changed or the decision on the issue is rendered suspect on account of the judgment not taking the applicable law into account or any pronouncement of a superior forum has intervened, the matter may not be revisited,” the court said. According to the petitioner, most of the temples have been set up according to the agama principles and it has been the age-old tradition for mantras to be chanted in Sanskrit. The very sanctity of the mantras will be destroyed if not chanted in Sanskrit, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-mantras-in-temples-cant-be-stopped-says-madras-hc/articleshow/85916060.cms||---
