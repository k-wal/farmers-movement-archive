Devendra Murgaonkar and Muhammed Nemil scored a brace each while Princeton Rebello also added his name to the scoresheet. Goa had already qualified for the quarterfinals, having won their first two matches. Coach Juan Ferrando who was upset after Jorge Ortiz's ankle injury in the last game against Sudeva Delhi FC, fielded a competitive team against their opponents who needed nothing less than a win to progress to the next round. Once again, Alberto Noguera started the game and Goa showed urgency right from the word go against their Indian Super League counterparts' reserve side. Centre forward Devendra gave them the lead with a glancing header off a corner by captain Brandon Fernandes in the 19th minute. Princeton then powered in a right-footer from close for his first senior team goal. Princeton then sent in a perfect through ball for Brandon, whose shot was blocked by the rival goalkeeper. However, Devendra was the fastest to react and scored off the rebound before the break. In the second half, it was all about Nemil. The highly-rated youngster proved his worth once again with a sublime finish after being put through by Noguera just two minutes after the restart. Goa goalkepeer Hrithik Tiwari who came up the ranks from the U-18 side was hardly tested on his senior debut. At the other end, there was no stopping Goa and Nemil in particular. This time, his finish had class written all over it as the 19-year-old showed maturity beyond his age to spectacularly chip the ball over the goalkeeper with nine minutes to go. Goa finished top of Group B and will now face the second placed team in Group C at the Mohun Bagan ground on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/five-star-fc-goa-continue-winning-run-in-durand-cup/articleshow/86304162.cms||FLAVIO LOPES

The average retail price of packed mustard oil is constantly increasing and on Friday, it was selling at Rs 180 per litre compared to Rs 173 a month back. According to the price monitoring cell of the consumer affairs ministry, the average retail price of edible oils in the past one month show that sunflower oil price (packed) had increased to Rs 174 per litre last week from Rs 171 a month back. But on Friday, the average price of the edible oil was Rs 167 a litre. Similarly, the average price of palm oil had increased to Rs 134 a week back, but on Friday the edible oil was selling at Rs 132 per litre. In the case of soyabean oil prices in the retail market, there has been no change in the past one week. The per litre packaged soyabean oil was selling at Rs 156. However, beating the trend, the average retail price of mustard oil has increased consistently. The Solvent Extractor’s Association of India (SEAI) had urged the government to reduce the import duty on rapeseed in line with soya and sunflower oil or even a little lower as it would have the desired effect on runaway mustard oil prices. They had made this suggestion considering that there is low arrival of mustard seed in the market. Meanwhile, citing the official data and also from the SEAI, the government said the daily wholesale prices of packed palm oil dropped by 2.5 per cent, followed by packed groundnut oil by 1.4 per cent, packed sunflower oil by 1.3 per cent, packed mustard oil by 1% and packed Soya Oil by 0.7 per cent. “Based on the interaction with all the states and edible oil industry associations, the need for greater transparency was felt. As a follow up action the food ministry is in the process of creating a web portal for monitoring the stocks of edible oils and oilseeds on a weekly basis in the country. The data on the portal will be submitted by millers, refiners, stockists and wholesalers etc. States have also issued directions for display of retail price prominently to ensure fair pricing,” the food ministry said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/prices-marginally-ease-for-most-edible-oils-but-mustard-oil-defies-trend/articleshow/86304258.cms||Dipak K Dash
---||World||10,000 migrants, many Haitian, packed under Texas bridge||HOUSTON: More than 10,000 undocumented migrants, many of them Haitians, were being held under a bridge in Texas on Friday, United States officials said, posing a new challenge to President Joe Biden's immigration policy.  Bruno Lozano, the mayor of Del Rio on the US-Mexico border, said that the migrants were crowded in an area controlled by the US Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) beneath the Del Rio International Bridge.  Many of them were Haitians hoping to stay in the United States as their country suffers after a large earthquake and continuing political turmoil, Lozano said.  The mayor said there were 10,503 people under the bridge on Thursday evening, up from around 8,000 earlier in the day.  Video footage showed families sitting and sleeping in the open air, awaiting processing by the CBP, which has been overwhelmed by migrants crossing the border from Mexico as well as tens of thousands of refugees from Afghanistan.  "The border patrol right now is so overwhelmed with the influx of migrants in the Del Rio sector," Lozano said.  He said, besides those under the bridge, there were another 2,000-3,000 held in detention by CBP in the area. In a statement, the CBP said it was sending extra personnel and resources.  "To prevent injuries from heat-related illness, the shaded area underneath Del Rio International Bridge is serving as a temporary staging site while migrants wait to be taken into Border Patrol custody," it said.  CBP said the "vast majority" of single migrants and many of the families would be expelled under the government's Title 42 policy curtailing immigration due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  "Those who cannot be expelled under Title 42 and do not have a legal basis to remain will be placed in expedited removal proceedings," CBP said.  Both Republicans and Democrats called for quick action from Biden, whose administration recorded and mostly expelled more than 200,000 migrants at the border in both July and August, the highest numbers in more than a decade.  Some said Biden's decision in late July after Haitian president Jovenel Moise's assassination to allow Haitians without US visas at the time to remain in the country offered an incentive for others to come.  "As many as 10,503 illegal aliens are under this bridge tonight because Joe Biden made a political decision to cancel deportation flights to Haiti," Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz tweeted on Thursday.  Meanwhile Democratic Representative Ilhan Omar, herself an immigrant, also pressed Biden to act.  "This needs an urgent response from the Biden administration that is comprehensive and includes a cross-agency collaboration," she said in a statement.  "Let's help these folks who are stranded there and act swiftly before this gut-wrenching situation grows to unmanageable level."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/10000-migrants-many-haitian-packed-under-texas-bridge/articleshow/86304878.cms||---
---||India||Supreme Court Collegium recommends new Chief Justices for 13 HCs||NEW DELHI: In the biggest ever single-stroke reshuffle in constitutional courts, the Supreme Court Collegium led by Chief Justice of India N V Ramana on Friday recommended appointment of eight High Court judges as Chief Justices of various HCs and transferred five HC chief justices as head of other HCs, thus taking steps to put in place new chief justices in 13 states. The Collegium also recommended transfers of 28 HC judges from their present HCs to other HCs, many on request and others for better administration of justice, SC sources said. Never before had the Collegium at one go ordered such a big reshuffle involving 41 HC Judges - 13 HC chief justices and 28 Judges. All the recommendations are expected to reach the Union law ministry by Saturday for processing. Justice Rajesh Bindal, who as acting chief justice of Calcutta HC had stirred a few feathers in West Bengal by staying the bail granted to TMC ministers and MLAs arrested in Narada scam on a letter petition by CBI, has been recommended to be appointed as the Chief Justice of Allahabad HC, the biggest HC in the country with a sanctioned strength of 160 judges. Chief Justice of Tripura HC, Akil Kureshi has been recommended to be transferred to Rajasthan HC as CJ. The insistence on recommending Justice Kureshi’s name for appointment as SC judge by a former Collegium member had virtually deadlocked Collegium deliberations for nearly a year. The Collegium could resume HC judge and CJ selection after the retirement of that SC judge last month. Within a month the SC Collegium headed by CJI Ramana filled 9 vacant posts in SC and recommended over 110 names for appointment as HC judges. The Collegium, also comprising Justices U U Lalit, A M Khanwilkar, D Y Chandrachud and L N Rao held marathon meetings spanning days, which resulted in the CJI and four most senior SC Judges sitting half an hour late in the court on two consecutive days, to finalise names of HC judges suitable for heading state judiciaries as well as transfer five CJs to other HCs for better administration of justice. Other 4 CJs who have been transferred are: Justice Arup Kumar Goswami, transferred from Andhra Pradesh HC to Chhattisgarh HC; Justice Mohd Rafiq from Madhya Pradesh to Himachal Pradesh HC; Justice Indrajit Mahanty from Rajasthan HC to Tripura HC and Justice Biswanath Somadder from Meghalaya to Sikkim HC. Justice Prakash Srivastava, who is the senior-most judge in Madhya Pradesh HC, has been recommended to be appointed as the Chief Justice of Calcutta HC. Acting chief justice of Chhattisgarh HC Prashant Kumar Mishra is recommended to be appointed as the chief justice of Andhra Pradesh HC. Justice Ritu Raj Awasthi of Allahabad HC has been recommended for appointment as the Chief Justice of Karnataka HC. Justice Satish Chandra Sharma, whose parent HC is Madhya Pradesh and is presently posted as Judge in Karnataka HC, has been recommended for appointment as Chief Justice of Telangana HC. The HC CJ post was vacant after appointment of Justice Hima Kohli as judge of the Supreme Court. Justice Ranjit V More, from Bombay HC and presently the most senior judge in Meghalaya HC, has been recommended for appointment as CJ of Meghalaya. Karnataka High Court Judge Arvind Kumar has been recommended for appointment as CJ of Gujarat HC. Justice Ravi Vijaykumar Malimath, who hails from Karnataka and presently the acting chief justice of Himachal Pradesh, has been recommended for appointment as Chief Justice of Madhya Pradesh HC. The 28 HC judges transferred to different HCs are: Justice Sabina from Rajasthan to Himachal Pradesh; Justice A.M. Badar from Kerala to Patna; Justice Vivek Agarwal from Allahabad to Madhya Pradesh: Justice Sudip Ahluwalia from Punjab and Haryana HC to Calcutta HC; Justice Ravi Nath Tilhari from Allahabad to Andhra Pradesh; Justice Chandra Dhari Singh from Allahabad to Delhi HC; Justice Anoop Chitkara from Himachal Pradesh to Punjab and Haryana HC; Justice Yashwant Varma from Allahabad to Delhi; Justice T S. Sivagnanam from Madras to Calcutta: Justice Manindra Mohan Shrivastava from Chattisgarh to Rajasthan; Justice Arindam Sinha from Calcutta to Orissa HC. Justice Ujjal Bhuyan from Bombay to Telangana: Justice Sureshwar Thakurfrom Himachal Pradesh to Allahabad;: Justice Jaswant Singh from Punjab and Haryana to Orissa HC; Justice Subhash Chand (Additional Judge) from Allahabad to Jharkhand; Justice M.S.S. Ramachandra Rao from Telangana to Punjab and Haryana; Justice M.N. Bhandari from Allahabad to Madras; Justice Ahsanuddin Amanullah from Patna to Andhra Pradesh; Justice Sanjaya Kumar Mishra from Orissa to Uttarakhand; Justice Soumen Sen from Calcutta to Orissa; Justice P B Bajanthri from Karnataka to Patna; Justice Sanjeev Prakash Sharma from Rajasthan to Patna; Justice Paresh R Upadhyay from Gujarat to Madras; Justice Amarnath Goud from Telangana to Tripura; and, Rajan Gupta from Punjab and Haryana to Patna.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/supreme-court-collegium-recommends-new-chief-justices-for-13-hcs/articleshow/86305385.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||World||As California fire nears, crews protect world's largest tree in special wrap||THREE RIVERS: Fire crews have resorted to wrapping the bases of some giant sequoias in fire-resistant coverings in a desperate effort to save the towering specimens, including the General Sherman, the world's largest tree, the National Park Service said on Friday.  The blaze, one of dozens to erupt across several western states in a fire season that got off to an early start, forced the closing earlier this week of Sequoia National Park and left a dense layer of smoke in the area early on Friday.  Air quality was poor in the small town of Three Rivers, which is near a park entrance and about halfway between Los Angeles and San Francisco, according to the town's website.  The so-called KNP Complex fire, formed by the merger of two other wildfires, had grown to more than 9,000 acres (3,640 hectares) by late on Thursday, according to the federal Inciweb fire information system.  It was burning about a mile (1.6 km) from the park's Giant Forest, home to the largest tree on earth by volume, dubbed General Sherman, before 115 employees evacuated the park earlier this week, the park service said.  "Crews are preparing the Giant Forest before the fire reaches that area, by removing fuel and applying structure wrap on some of the iconic monarch sequoias that characterise the most famous area of Sequoia National Park," the park service said in a statement early on Friday.  The General Sherman tree towers over 2,000 other giant sequoias in the park at 275 feet (83 m) and is over 36 feet (11 m) in diameter at its base, according to the park service.  Crews of 482 firefighters, aided by aircraft, are battling the week-old blaze, which was started by lightning and is burning in difficult-to-reach steep canyons, fueled by dry timber and chaparral, the Inciweb system said.  Maximum wind gusts of about 40 miles per hour (65 kph) have been hampering firefighters, but a predicted cooling trend is expected to aid their battle, it said.  The KNP Complex is one of at least 28 fires in California and 129 across several western states that have erupted since June in a fire season that traditionally begins in late summer, according to Inciweb data.  Other steps the park service said it has taken to protect the sequoias are prescribed burns, which would reduce the amount of available fuel in case KNP complex reaches them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/as-california-fire-nears-crews-protect-worlds-largest-tree-in-special-wrap/articleshow/86305470.cms||---
---||World||Pentagon reverses itself, calls deadly Kabul strike an error||WASHINGTON: The Pentagon retreated from its defence of a drone strike that killed multiple civilians in Afghanistan last month, announcing Friday that an internal review revealed that only civilians were killed in the attack, not an Islamic State extremist as first believed. "The strike was a tragic mistake," Marine Gen. Frank McKenzie, head of US Central Command, told a Pentagon news conference.  For days after the August 29 strike, Pentagon officials asserted that it had been conducted correctly, despite numerous civilians being killed, including children.  News organisations later raised doubts about that version of events, reporting that the driver of the targeted vehicle was a longtime employee at an American humanitarian organisation and citing an absence of evidence to support the Pentagon's assertion that the vehicle contained explosives.  McKenzie said the vehicle was struck "in the earnest belief" that the targeted vehicle posed an imminent threat.  "I am now convinced that as many as 10 civilians, including up to seven children, were tragically killed in that strike," McKenzie said. "Moreover, we now assess that it is unlikely that the vehicle and those who died were associated with ISIS-K, or a direct threat to US forces," he added, referring to the Islamic State group's Afghanistan affiliate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/only-civilians-killed-kabul-strike-an-error-pentagon/articleshow/86306349.cms||---

During the two-year investigation, ordered by CCI in April 2019, the panel questioned Google - the leader of the dominant and ubiquitous Android operating system (OS) with nearly 98% of the smartphone market - and multiple multi-national and Indian companies such as Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Paytm, PhonePe, Mozilla, Samsung, Xiaomi, Vivo, Oppo and Karbonn. The probe found Google India guilty of stifling competition and innovation to the detriment of the market as well as consumers in order to maintain its grip and dominance in search, music (through YouTube), browser (chrome), app library (Play Store) and other key services. The investigation report, which runs into nearly 750 pages, was reviewed exclusively by TOI. The probe accuses Google of imposing and forcing one-sided contracts on devices as well as app makers to ensure that its own products and apps maintain primacy in consumer usage, and come pre-installed and as default options to get the highest user preference. "Google is found to be contravening the provisions of Section 4(2)(a)(i); Section 4(2)(b); Section 4(2)(c); Section 4(2)(d) and Section 4(2)(e) of the Competition Act," the probe report summed up, holding the company guilty of a variety of charges, including abuse of dominance, denial of market access to competitors, and limiting and restricting technical or scientific development relating to goods or services to the prejudice of consumers. The report has been placed before the CCI for consideration and if found guilty, Google could face penalties or be asked to discontinue practices that are seen to distort competition and are anti-consumer based on market dominance. Google has faced and is facing antitrust investigations in various parts of the globe - from the US to the European Union, Germany and Japan. The Indian investigation looked into a variety of issues after CCI first received a complaint alleging that Google India had hindered the development and market access of rival mobile apps or services by requiring smartphone and tablet manufacturers through certain exclusive deals to pre-install its proprietary apps and /or services. Based on its own exclusive terms, the company offered its coveted Google Mobile Services (GMS) suite with popular products as a bundle, and this included Google Play Store, search app, YouTube, and Chrome browser. A device-maker wanting to go beyond the "bare Android version" and to make use of any of the key Google apps is mandated by Google to sign a Mobile Application Distribution Agreement (MADA) and further an Anti-Fragmentation Agreement (AFA)/Android Compatibility Commitment (ACC), which requires pre-loading of Google apps and a predetermined placement for them on the devices. Also, device manufacturers and other partners are offered lucrative revenue-share agreements - including top player Apple for search engine option for its Safari browser - so that they give primacy to a Google-only ecosystem of apps and services. In the search engines category, which is the tech giant's primary business, the CCI probe found that Google has been "foreclosing competition" in the Android operating system as through MADA, the search widget is placed on the default home screen of devices and Chrome browser inserted in a folder of Google apps. "Competing general search services cannot offset the competitive advantage that Google ensures for itself through pre-installation and thus, acting as an entry barrier for competitors," the investigation noted. With Google controlling nearly all of the smart mobile market in India through Android, this further helps it dominate the search market as it gets access to swathes of user data that makes its results sharper, the report said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/google-abusing-position-playing-unfair-cci-probe/articleshow/86306396.cms||Pankaj Doval
---||World||FDA advisory panel rejects widespread Pfizer booster shots||WASHINGTON: An influential federal advisory panel has soundly rejected a plan to offer Pfizer booster shots against Covid-19 to most Americans.  The vote Friday, 16-2, was a blow to the Biden administration's effort to shore up people's protection against the virus amid the highly contagious Delta variant.  Over several hours of discussion, members of the Food and Drug Administration panel of outside experts voiced frustration that Pfizer had provided little data on safety of extra doses.  And they complained that data provided by Israeli researchers about their booster campaign might not be suitable for predicting the US experience. Scientists inside and outside the government have been divided in recent days over the need for boosters and who should get them, and the World Health Organization has strongly objected to rich nations giving a third round of shots when poor countries don't have enough vaccine for their first.  The panel, made up of outside experts who advise the Food and Drug Administration, weighed a less than clear-cut case: While research suggests immunity levels in those who have been vaccinated wane over time and boosters can reverse that, the Pfizer vaccine is still highly protective against severe illness and death, even amid the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant.  The FDA experts were scheduled to vote on one basic question: Does the evidence show that a Pfizer booster would be safe and effective for people 16 and older?  But that is just one step in the process. The more thorny question of who should get the shots and when will be debated on Wednesday by advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC generally adopts the recommendations of the group, which sets policy for the US vaccination campaigns.  The CDC has said it is considering boosters for older people, nursing home residents and front-line health care workers, rather than all adults.  Separate FDA and CDC decisions will be needed in order for people who received the Moderna or J&J shots to get boosters.  At Friday's meeting, the FDA panelists heard full-throated arguments about the need for boosters from both Pfizer and health officials from Israel, which began offering boosters to its citizens in July.  Sharon Alroy-Preis of Israel's Ministry of Health said the booster dose improves protection tenfold against infection in people 60 and older.  "It's like a fresh vaccine," bringing protection back to original levels and helping Israel "dampen severe cases in the fourth wave," she said.  And representatives for Pfizer argued that it is important to shore up immunity before protection against severe disease starts to erode. A company study of 44,000 people showed effectiveness against symptomatic Covid-19 was 96% two months after the second dose, but had dropped to 84% by around six months.  Both Pfizer and the Israeli representatives faced pushback from panelists. Several expressed skepticism about the relevance of Israel's experience to the US. Also complicating the committee's decision: No one yet knows the antibody level below which infection is likely and boosters are needed. FDA vaccine reviewer Dr. Philip Krause raised a host of questions about the reliability of one of the key studies Pfizer said showed that immunity is waning.  Another concern was whether third doses would exacerbate serious side effects.  Dr Cody Meissner of Tufts Medical Center said he is worried about extra doses for younger age groups given the risk of heart inflammation that has been seen in mostly younger men after a second dose. While the condition is very rare, he said, it is not clear if that risk would increase with another dose.  On Friday, US Surgeon General Dr Vivek Murthy said that in announcing its booster plan, the Biden administration was not trying to pressure regulators to act, but was instead trying to be transparent with the public and be prepared in the event that extra shots won approval.  "We have always said that this initial plan would be contingent on the FDA and the CDC's independent evaluation," Murthy said.  The Biden plan has also raised major ethical concerns about impoverished parts of the world still clamoring for vaccine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/fda-advisory-panel-rejects-widespread-pfizer-booster-shots/articleshow/86307238.cms||---

Negotiators are working on new deliverables to be announced on September 24. Meanwhile, the first Modi-Biden summit too is likely to be held on September 24, ahead of the Quad summit. An earlier plan had the bilateral on the 23rd and the Quad summit on the 24th with Modi's UNGA address on the 25th. After the Afghanistan withdrawal, the US has decisively turned global attention to China with the announcement of the AUKUS security partnership that will give Australia a clutch of nuclear-powered submarines (SSNs), adding to the defence heft of the Quad. China has been furiously building up its defence platforms but nuclear submarines are still beyond its reach. Experts say this would give Australia an advantage in that area to offset China's military modernisation. The Quad summit is likely to take that pivot forward. At the March virtual summit, the four countries had focused their attention on vaccines, critical and emerging technologies and climate change. Officials say India's Biological E is on track to begin production of Johnson & Johnson's single-shot vaccine for the Indo-Pacific countries from early 2022. There is not much reported progress on the move to harmonise approaches to critical technologies - the idea being to exchange information with the aim of collaborating in their development as well as being trusted partners in their sharing. But joint infrastructure initiatives is intended to give China's BRI a run for its money. The mantra at the Quad end for infrastructure cooperation is very different from the ruling principles of the BRI. These were articulated by PM Modi at the SCO summit on Friday when he said all connectivity initiatives should be consultative, transparent and implemented with due respect to the territorial integrity of all countries. The US, under Trump, had started a Blue Dot network - to certify international infrastructure and connectivity projects as being transparent and fiscally sound, without a debt trap. Its unclear whether that will be added to the infrastructure initiative.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/to-counter-chinas-bri-quad-plans-indo-pacific-infra-push/articleshow/86307690.cms||Indrani Bagchi
---||World||Woman gets probation for 'minimal' role in Capitol riot||COLLEGE PARK: A day before a rally is scheduled to held in protest against alleged mistreatment of jailed insurrectionists, involved in January 6 Capitol riots, a federal judge sentenced a California architect on Friday to probation for her role in the violence, stressing that the insurrection "represented a threat to democracy" and continues to resonate "in sad and unfortunate ways".  United States District Judge Paul Friedman noted that security fencing has gone up around the Capitol in preparation for the rally on Saturday by what he called "misguided" people protesting what they allege is the mistreatment of jailed insurrectionists who tried to stop the certification of former President Donald Trump's loss to Joe Biden.  Friedman sentenced Valerie Elaine Ehrke to three years of probation and ordered her to perform 120 hours of community service.  Justice Department prosecutors said they recommended a probationary sentence for Ehrke because she was inside the Capitol for about one minute, only stepped about 15 feet into the building and didn't engage in any violence or property destruction. Friedman said Ehrke's role in the insurrection was "about as minimal as it gets".  More than 600 people have been charged with federal crimes related to the riot. Ehrke is one of about 70 defendants who have pleaded guilty to riot-related charges.  Friedman noted that some believe the jailed insurrectionists are "patriots".  "And some of them may be on some level. But on another level, the conduct they engaged in in order to pursue their beliefs is not First Amendment speech and not First Amendment legitimate protest," Friedman said. "What came to be was a riot, was an incitement, was an insurrection".  He echoed another judge's position that probation shouldn't be the "automatic outcome" for misdemeanor convictions like Ehrke's. Everybody who stormed the Capitol "represented a threat to democracy, to our democratic norms, and continue to resonate in sad and unfortunate ways," Friedman said.  Ehrke is the seventh Capitol riot defendant to be sentenced. She pleaded guilty on June 30 to illegally parading, demonstrating or picketing in a Capitol building.  Over 40 other Capitol riot defendants have pleaded guilty to the same misdemeanor offense, which carries a maximum sentence of 6 months imprisonment and a $5,000 fine.  Ehrke told the judge that the Jan. 6 riot was "such a unique situation".  "I did not have the depth of experience to understand that I needed to get out of there or stay away," she said.  In a letter submitted to the court before her sentencing, Ehrke called herself "a fine member of society" who often picks up trash in her neighborhood and has worked on architectural projects in her community free of charge.  "I am a small town girl who loves my town, my state and my country," she wrote.  Prosecutors asked Friedman to sentence Ehrke to three years of probation and 40 hours of community service. Assistant US Attorney Kevin Birney said Ehrke was among the first Capitol riot defendants to agree to plead guilty.  "The government places a lot of weight on that," he added.  Ehrke traveled to Washington, D.C., from her home in Arbuckle, California, on Jan. 5 to attend Trump's speech on the following day. After hearing the speech, she initially returned to her hotel room.  "However, when she saw a news story about how people were going to the US Capitol, she decided she wanted to be part of the crowd," prosecutors wrote in a court filing.  Ehrke recorded and uploaded videos to Facebook as she walked to the Capitol, including one with a caption that said she was heading to the "breached" building. Ehrke would have heard an alarm sounding throughout the Capitol when she entered. She was stopped at the back of a crowd of people when police started pushing them back through a hallway and out of the building through a door.  "We made it inside, right before they shoved us all out. I took off when I felt pepper spray in my throat! Lol," Ehrke posted on Facebook.  The picture for Ehrke's Facebook profile was a flaming "Q", an apparent reference to the QAnon conspiracy theory. Many QAnon followers believe Trump was fighting a secret campaign against a Satan-worshipping cabal of deep state enemies, prominent Democrats and Hollywood elites operating a child sex-trafficking ring.  The riot disrupted the certification of the 2020 Electoral College vote count. More than 100 law enforcement officers were injured during the mob's attack, which also caused more than $1 million in property damage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/woman-gets-probation-for-minimal-role-in-capitol-riot/articleshow/86307900.cms||---
---||India||EAM distances govt from Rawat's China statement||NEW DELHI: China should not view India through the lens of third countries, external affairs minister S Jaishankar told his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi during their meeting in Dushanbe on Thursday even as he called for complete military disengagement in eastern Ladakh. Calling for restoration of status quo on the borders, Jaishankar made it clear that bilateral relations would not be restored until this was done, iterating the Indian position since flare-up of military tensions in April last year. But significantly, Jaishankar used the occasion to distance India from Samuel Huntington's theory of international relations that outlined a "Clash of Civilisations". "India had never subscribed to any clash of civilisations theory," the minister said, according to an MEA readout. "He said that India and China had to deal with each other on merits and establish a relationship based on mutual respect. For this, it was necessary that China avoids viewing our bilateral relations from the perspective of its relations with third countries. Asian solidarity would depend on the example set by India-China relations." Chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat, quoting the "Clash of Civilisations" theory at a lecture at the IIC earlier this week, had said it mentions that the Confucian or 'Sinic' civilisation would actually join hands with the Islamic civilisation to counter the western one. "Whether that is going to happen or not, only time will tell. But we are seeing some kind of 'jointmanship' between the Sinic and Islamic civilisations. You can see China is now making friends with Iran, moving towards Turkey and stepping into Afghanistan. They (China) will step into Afghanistan in the time to come very shortly," Gen Rawat had said. The Chinese foreign ministry, in its own readout, described the working mechanism and corps commander meetings as "earnest and effective", and the overall situation in the border area as "gradually de-escalated". Wang, it said, "hopes that India will meet China halfway to move the situation towards stability and shift it from urgent dispute settlement to regular management and control. Both sides need to consolidate the disengagement results of frontline troops, and strictly abide by the protocols and agreements reached between the two countries, it said. While some disengagement has happened, there are other friction points that continue to be in contention.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/eam-distances-govt-from-rawats-china-statement/articleshow/86307960.cms||---

---||India||A hint at alliance? Uddhav’s remark on BJP mantris sparks speculations||MUMBAI: Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray sparked fresh speculation across political circles about a possible remaking of the Shiv Sena-BJP alliance after he referred to Union ministers Raosaheb Danve and Bhagwat Karad from BJP as potential "future colleagues." Political pundits wondered if Thackeray's comments were laced with humour or whether he was dropping a big hint. Former CM Devendra Fadnavis, however, ruled out the possibility of the former saffron allies coming together. Speaking at an event in Aurangabad where he shared the stage with Danve, Thackeray said, "Present here are my current, former.... and if we come together, my future colleagues." Danve is the Union minister of state (MoS) for railways and a BJP MP from Jalna. Karad is Union MoS for finance. "I like the railways for one reason. You can't leave the tracks and change direction. But if there is a diversion you can come to our station. The engine does not leave the tracks," Thackeray said in his speech. Thackeray, whose party Shiv Sena has opposed the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train, also said he would offer full support if Danve took the initiative to launch the Mumbai-Nagpur bullet train project. The CM's remarks came a day after BJP state unit chief Chandrakant Patil said he should not be called a "former minister". Also, currently, Sena minister Anil Parab is facing a summons from the Enforcement Directorate in a money laundering case. When asked about his remarks and a possible alliance with BJP, Thackeray later told media persons that "only time would tell". BJP's leader of opposition in the state assembly Devendra Fadnavis ruled out the possibility of an alliance but Danve chose to add to the speculation. "The CM must have said this because he realised that the unnatural alliance of three parties is not likely to last much longer," he said. Later on Friday, Danve met Shiv Sena minister Abdul Sattar. "He has said that if they come together, which means that he hasn't ruled out the possibility of us coming together," Danve said. "It means that he might have some experiences with the colleagues from the Congress and NCP," he added. State Congress chief Nana Patole downplayed the comments. "The CM sometimes likes to crack a joke. This government will run its full five-year term," Patole said.

ESIC regional office in Odisha has appealed to the children of ESI beneficiaries to apply for the quota while taking admission in these medical colleges. “They need to qualify in NEET-UG-2021 to become eligible to apply,” said an official. ESIC regional office Odisha director Parthasarathy Panda said they have six ESIC medical colleges and a dental college across the country. “Besides, three other government medical colleges are offering insured person (IP) quota to children of ESI beneficiaries,” Panda said. He said a total of 382 MBBS seats and 28 BDS seats are there in these colleges in the country. Number of seats may change according to the state and Centre’s guidelines, he added. Officials said candidates under IP quota are allotted seats based on their merit-cum-preference through a centralised online counselling conducted by the directorate general of health services. Admission fee (for a MBBS/BDS seat) is only Rs 24,000 per year for a candidate under IP quota. “It is a good provision which can help many students in the state. ESI beneficiaries or their children are not aware about this. We request them to visit our website or our office to know about this and get its benefit,” said Panda.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/esi-beneficiaries-kids-can-avail-quota-in-mbbs-admission/articleshow/86300279.cms||Hemanta Pradhan

Acting on a tip-off, the wildlife officials raided Mundakati village and found five hides of Asian monitor lizard and a sambar antler that weighed two kg weight and was 31 inches long. Both poachers are habitual offenders, wildlife officials said. The raid was conducted by the patrolling squad of Hirakud wildlife division. “We are trying to ascertain the network of local operators involved in wildlife trade in Debrigarh. We have increased vigil and have deployed informers in the identified poaching routes in and around Debrigarh sanctuary,” said Anshu Pragyan Das, divisional forest officer, Hirakud wildlife division. The poachers were identified as Ramanidhi Bhoe (52) and Kshamanidhi Pradhan (35). Both belong to Mundakati village and work as cattle grazers. Wildlife officials said the hide of Asian monitor lizard is used to make hand bags, homemade accessories, etc. The hides seized had been dried so that it is devoid of moisture and smell, wildlife officials said. Five ft long monitor lizards are found in Debrigarh. They have a forked tongue. Because of their thick skin they are not the favoured preys of big carnivores. In Debrigarh, they are hunted for meat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/two-poachers-held-with-animal-parts/articleshow/86300318.cms||Riyan Ramanath V

While 13 companies have submitted bids for the Kasia block, sources in the state steel and mines department said as many as seven have cleared the technical bidding round and can now take part in the financial bidding for the block, spread over 194.19 hectares. “Companies who have qualified in the technical bidding for other blocks will be informed a day before the scheduled auction of the concerned block,” said a steel and mines department official. The official said the entire financial bidding process will be completed in 10 days following which lease deeds will be signed with the preferred bidders. Total 123 bids have been received by the state for the 11 mineral deposits. Major mining and metal industries like Jindal Steel and Power Limited, Adani, JSW, Tata Steel, ArcelorMittal, Essel Mining and Industries Limited, Rungta Mines Ltd, MSPL, Vedanta and NMDC are in the race for the 11 blocks. The blocks which are up for grabs in the auction process include Kasia, Nadidih (Bico), Nadidih (Feegrade), Teherai, Pureibahal, Chandiposhi, Jumka, Dholtapahar, Netrabandha Pahar (West), Gandhalpada and Karlapat. Even as a petition has been filed in the Orissa high court by a Odisha-based mining contractor over auction of the first bauxite deposit — Karlapat — sources said the auction is on schedule and there would won’t be any delay unless a specific direction is received from the court. After auction of these five blocks, the government would initiate second round of auction likely in October during which as many as five mineral deposits will be auctioned. These include Pipalmunda, Garamurarh, Uskalvagu, Behera-Bhanjipali dolomite blocks and Naringpanga graphite block. Mining and metal sector contributes significantly to the state’s overall revenue collection. Financial gain to the state because of the ongoing auction process will be known after signing of the lease deeds by the preferred bidders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/financial-bidding-to-start-today-for-11-mineral-blocks/articleshow/86300312.cms||Sujit kumar bisoyi
---||World||North Carolina judges strike down state's voter ID law||RALEIGH: North Carolina judges struck down the state's latest photo voter identification law on Friday, agreeing with minority voters that Republicans rammed through rules tainted by racial bias as a way to remain in power.  Two of the three trial judges declared the December 2018 law is unconstitutional, even though it was designed to implement a photo voter ID mandate added to the North Carolina Constitution in a referendum just weeks earlier. They said the law was rushed and intentionally discriminates against Black voters, violating their equal protections.  The law "was motivated at least in part by an unconstitutional intent to target African American voters," Superior Court Judges Michael O'Foghludha and Vince Rozier wrote in their 102-page order.  "Other, less restrictive voter ID laws would have sufficed to achieve the legitimate non-racial purposes of implementing the constitutional amendment requiring voter ID, deterring fraud, or enhancing voter confidence," the judges added.  The majority decision, which followed a three-week trial in April, will be appealed, Republicans at the legislature said. A state appeals court had previously blocked the law's enforcement last year. The law remains unenforceable with this ruling.  With a similar lawsuit in federal court set to go to trial next January and another state court lawsuit now on appeal, it's looking more unlikely that the current voter ID law will be enforced in the 2022 elections.  Allison Riggs, the plaintiffs' lead attorney, praised the decision. Riggs said the ruling reflects "how the state's Republican-controlled legislature undeniably implemented this legislation to maintain its power by targeting voters of colour".  Republicans have said voter ID laws are needed to build public confidence in elections and to prevent voter fraud, which remains rare nationwide. Many Democrats see the mandates as attempts at voter suppression.  In July 2016, a federal appeals court struck down several portions of a 2013 North Carolina law that included a voter ID mandate, saying GOP lawmakers had written them with "almost surgical precision" to discourage voting by Black residents, who tend to support Democrats.  Lawyers for the voters who sued over the 2018 law said it suffered from similar racial defects as the 2013 law - following a long effort by North Carolina elected officials to weaken African American voting as a way to retain control the General Assembly. The 2013 law was carried out briefly in 2016 primary elections.  GOP legislative leaders and their attorneys disagreed, saying the latest ID rules were approved with noteworthy Democratic support and improved to retain ballot access while ensuring only legal citizens can vote.  The categories of qualifying IDs were greatly expanded compared to the 2013 law to include college student and government-employee IDs. Free IDs also were made available, and people without IDs can still vote if they fill out a form.  Sam Hayes, an attorney for House Speaker Tim Moore, said "liberal judges have defied the will of North Carolinians on election integrity" with the decision. Moore and Senate leader Phil Berger are among defendants in the lawsuit.  "Photo voter ID laws are designed to bolster confidence in elections. Calling this law irredeemably racist does the exact opposite," Sen. Paul Newton of Cabarrus County said.  In the dissenting opinion, Judge Nathaniel Poovey wrote there was "not one scintilla of evidence" presented that any legislator acted with racially discriminatory intent.  The plaintiffs' evidence relied "heavily on the past history of other lawmakers and used an extremely broad brush to paint the 2018 General Assembly with the same toxic paint," Poovey wrote.  But the panel's majority wrote that while they found no legislator harboring racial animus toward Black voters, Republicans targeted voters "who, based on race, were unlikely to vote for the majority party" as the federal court also ruled in 2016.  About three dozen states have laws requesting or requiring voters to show some form of identification at the polls, and about half want photo ID only, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.  Six voters - five Black and one biracial - sued in Wake County court on the same day GOP lawmakers overrode Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper's veto of the 2018 voter ID bill.  Some plaintiffs testified at trial about difficulties obtaining an ID or voting when the earlier photo ID law was in effect. Lawyers for the GOP said all voters would continue to be able to vote under the 2018 law.  The plaintiffs' case emphasized the state's history of discriminatory voting laws, as well as an analysis from a University of Michigan professor who said Black voters are 39% more likely to lack a qualifying photo ID than white registered voters. The analysis, however, left out data on some categories of qualifying IDs.  Changes to these and other voting procedures in North Carolina once needed federal preapproval. But a 2013 U.S. Supreme Court ruling meant such "preclearance" actions were no longer required. The 2013 voter ID law was approved shortly after that ruling.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/north-carolina-judges-strike-down-states-voter-id-law/articleshow/86308312.cms||---

The ED also said Deshmukh was taking the help of Delhi-based hawala operators, accused brothers Surendra K Jain and Virendra Jain, since 2013 for layering tainted money. A CA has told ED he had introduced the Jain brothers to Deshmukh's son Hrishikesh "who wanted a person who would give donation to the family-owned Shri Sai Sikshan Sanasthan" in lieu of cash. The CA said he acted as guarantor/coordinator in this arrangement. Between 2013 and March 2021, a total of over Rs 4 crore was passed on to Deshmukh's trust in the garb of donations, the ED said. The brothers also helped Deshmukh layer the money that was illegally collected from bar owners by police officer (now-dismissed) Sachin Waze. The ED stated Deshmukh's family, with the help of close associates, were managing many companies and laundering money by creating a complex web of transactions. In the chargesheet ED filed against the Deshmukh-controlled trust and his two former staffers recently, it stated the Deshmukh-controlled firm Zodiac Dealcom Private Limited had raised Rs 9.8 crore through bogus share capital from 18 shell companies around a decade ago. Part of the funds were used for establishing the warehousing business in two companies, Rabia Logistics Pvt Ltd and Blackstone Logistics Pvt Ltd. The ED stated that later on, the fund generated from the warehousing business was routed through a number of companies owned by the Deshmukh family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ed-deshmukh-legitimised-tainted-cash-via-18-shell-cos/articleshow/86308337.cms||Vijay V Singh

The PIL was filed in 2013 by lawyer Arun Kumar Budhia. When the petition was apparently taken up for the first time on April 5 this year, the government responded by suggesting that steps have been taken to control the manufacture and sale of illicit liquor. When it was argued that the petition is not only about manufacture and sale of illicit liquor, but all forms of liquor, which stand prohibited under the Orissa Prohibition Act, the state counsel stated that he will take instructions. On his request the court posted the matter to June 22. But when the petition came up on that day, the counsel sought more time to file an affidavit. Allowing it, the court posted the matter to September 15 with a direction to the government to file the affidavit positively. But when the matter came up on Wednesday the court found the state was yet to file an affidavit pursuant to the June 22 order. The bench of Chief Justice S Muralidhar and Justice B P Routray said, “It is made clear that if the affidavit is not filed on or before November 1, cost of Rs 10,000 will be paid by the state to the High Court Advocates’ Welfare Fund and proof of the payment of such costs shall be placed on record. If the affidavit is not filed even before the next date (November 16), then the principal secretary to Government of Odisha, excise department shall remain present in virtual mode on that day.”  The assembly had passed the Orissa Prohibition Act, 1956, with the intention to introduce and extend prohibition on manufacture, sale and consumption of liquor and drugs in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/cuttack/hc-raps-state-for-dragging-feet-on-filing-affidavit/articleshow/86303672.cms||lalmohan.patnaik

India has received 33.4% surplus rainfall in September so far, helping narrow down the overall monsoon season deficit to 4%, from 10% in the last week of August. Any further improvement in the rest of this month will put this year's monsoon in the "normal" category. While one cyclonic circulation is likely to begin impacting Odisha and West Bengal from Saturday, as reported by on Wednesday, another system is expected to bring rain for four to five days starting around September 25, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said. "The monsoon is not likely to withdraw by the end of this month due to the likely formation of two cyclonic circulations over the Bay of Bengal and their west-northwestward movement across central and adjoining northwest India," said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, head of IMD. Meanwhile, weather models were pointing to the possibility of yet another system forming in the Bay of Bengal around September 28, but Mohapatra said it was too early to speak about it with any degree of certainty. Currently, a well-marked low pressure lay over north Madhya Pradesh and adjoining south Uttar Pradesh. This system is now expected to bring fairly widespread rain over Gujarat, Rajasthan and west Madhya Pradesh in the next three days, with showers increasing over Gujarat from Sunday, the met office said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/low-pressure-systems-to-keep-monsoon-active-till-sept-end/articleshow/86308571.cms||Amit Bhattacharya

Makthum Saab, 20, is a resident of Kurubarahalli, Mahalakshmipuram, and a private firm employee. Confessing before police, Makthum said he had spent a lot on his girlfriend, who died in a road accident in early August. Also, he was passionate about buying branded clothes and mobile phones, which made him raise hand loans of Rs 3 lakh. On September 13, Makthum’s father Ghani Saab filed a police complaint saying unidentified miscreants had abducted his son and were demanding Rs 5 lakh. Ghani Saab is a civil contractor. “My son Makthum works with a private firm in Yeshwantpur. On September 12 afternoon, he left home and never returned. His mobile phone was switched off. I received a voice message from him saying he has been kidnapped by four-five men and they were demanding Rs 5 lakh as ransom. I replied asking where I needed to come with the cash. An hour later, he sent another voice message saying I should make a digital payment. The mobile was switched off again,” Ghani Saab said in his complaint. Cops headed by deputy commissioner of police (north) Dharmender Kumar Meena swung into action. “We found he was in Tirupati and had reached there using a self-driven car. By then, we had realised there was something fishy. One team reached Tirupati and traced Makthum to a hotel room. As a precautionary measure, the team watched him carefully, while another one began a hunt for the abductors. By then, we discovered Makthum had met with a minor accident in the vehicle. Finally, we found he hadn’t been kidnapped and detained him before bringing him back to the city on September 14 evening,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bengaluru-debt-ridden-youth-fakes-kidnap-to-extort-rs-5-lakh-from-father/articleshow/86303589.cms||---

Altogether 2,00,58,425 people had received at least the first dose until the evening. This has taken the number of doses, including the first and second one, administered so far to 2,69,71,752. However, the second dose coverage remains low with only 69 lakh plus people in the state being fully vaccinated so far. The government healthcare authorities said many people seem to have forgotten their due dates, resulting in a low turnout at the session sites for the booster shots. This apart, some no longer seem to be interested in taking the booster shots owing to a let-up in cases, they added. Bijay Panigrahi, director of the family welfare department, said, “As far as the first dose is concerned, the vaccination drive is well on track. About 2.10 lakh people received the jab at 1,606 sites across the state on Friday. But there seems to be a tendency among people to give the second shot a miss. We are alerting them by sending reminder messages to their cell phones. About 29% of those whose second dose is due are yet to receive it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/2-crore-givenat-least-1-vaxdose-in-state/articleshow/86304630.cms||Riyan Ramanath V
---||Business||GST council agrees to keep fuel out for now||NEW DELHI: The GST Council on Friday reduced the levy on several life-saving medicines, agreed to correct the tax structure for several products - ranging from textiles and footwear to pens - and unanimously concluded that there was no need to include petrol and diesel under this tax regime for now. The concessional GST rates for four Covid drugs was extended by three months up to December 31, while the tax rate was pared for several items, including biodiesel used to blend diesel, retro-fitment kits for vehicles used by the disabled, and cartons, boxes, bags and packing containers of paper. Although the issue of GST on fuel - which states have been resisting - was on the agenda, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman clarified that it was the result of a high court directive which wanted the GST Council to look at the issue. Another ministerial panel will look at e-way bills, FASTag, technology and compliance and plugging loopholes. In terms of the recent directions of the high court of Kerala, the issue of whether specified petroleum products should be brought within the ambit of GST was placed for consideration before the Council. After discussion, the Council was unanimously of the view that it is not appropriate to do so at this stage," Sitharaman said. A key thrust was the correction of the inverted duty structure-where the final product attracts higher duty than inputs-which will result in 18% tax on pens, railway parts, locomotives and some other goods. In the case of textiles and footwear, which also suffer from the same problem, the details were not shared by the government. A group of ministers is being set up to look at other such areas where a correction may be warranted, Sitharaman told reporters after the meeting, the first physical gathering after over 16 months. She, however, made it clear that the group will not look at reworking the slabs. Another ministerial panel will look at e-way bills, FASTag, technology and compliance and plugging loopholes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/gst-council-agrees-to-keep-fuel-out-for-now/articleshow/86308943.cms||---
---||Cuttack||Orissa HC turns down plea to lift height cap on Durga idol||Cuttack: The Orissa HC on Friday said the height of the idol cannot be singled out as an essential aspect of a tradition or practice, without which the Durga Puja festival itself may not have any significance. The state government has restricted the maximum height of Durga Puja idols to 4ft for community pujas, saying the decision was taken to avoid a possible third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. The HC said the Durga Puja festival itself is a combination of several elements of celebration, and the idol is but one important component. “In respect of these many elements there has had to be some amount of restriction on the scale and size. It is in that context that the restriction on the height of the idol has to be viewed,” the two-judge bench of Chief Justice S Muralidhar and Justice B P Routray observed. The observation came while dismissing a petition filed by Cuttack city’s Balu Bazar Puja Committee seeking permission to raise the height of the Durga idol this year. The HC said the committee has not been able to convince the court that if the height of the idol is restricted to 4ft, then somehow the sanctity of the occasion, the devotion and fervour associated with the festival, and the religious sentiments of the people would be interfered with in a manner contrary to tradition. “These may be matters of perception, but will have to be balanced against several countervailing interests and factors, which concern the health and safety of the public at large. These are certainly not easy decisions for the state to take. Equally, they are not to be interfered with lightly by the courts unless strong legal grounds exist,” the bench also observed. The HC said Cuttack itself reportedly has more than 150 Durga Puja samitis/mandalis, while all over Odisha the number would apparently be in thousands. Relaxing a restriction for just one Durga Puja committee would trigger similar demands from all over, making it difficult for the government to strictly enforce the measures it has put in place at a time when the state is still in the grip of the Covid-19 pandemic, the bench further observed. On the other hand, barring the Balu Bazar Puja Committee, it appears that none of the other Durga Puja committees have found the restrictions on the height of the idol to be hurtful to public sentiment or interfering with their celebration of the events, the bench added. On being contacted, S N Sangneria, the president of the Balu Bazar Puja Committee, told TOI, “We will take a decision on whether to move the Supreme Court or not only after examining the full text of judgment.” In its 10-page judgment, the HC also said the Covid-19 situation now may not be the same as it was in these months last year. But the country and Odisha are still not entirely free from it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/cuttack/hc-turns-down-plea-to-lift-height-cap-on-durga-idol/articleshow/86300274.cms||lalmohan.patnaik

---||India||Mamata, not Rahul, only alternative to Modi, says Trinamool mouthpiece||KOLKATA: Trinamool Congress mouthpiece 'Jago Bangla' on Friday front-paged a lead article saying Rahul Gandhi hasn't succeeded and Mamata Banerjee was the only alternative to Narendra Modi. The article - quoting party seniors, including TMC's Lok Sabha leader Sudip Bandyopadhyay, speaking at a closed-door party conference on Wednesday - said while Congress was integral to the opposition bloc, Rahul didn't succeed to emerge as Modi's alternative despite several chances. Trinamool will start a campaign with Mamata as Modi's alternative, the article said. The daily quoted Bandyopadhyay as saying at the meeting that the nation needed an alternative. "I have known Rahul Gandhi for long. But I am forced to say that he has failed to emerge as a viable alternative to Narendra Modi. The entire country now wants Mamata (Banerjee). We will speak to all opposition parties and project Mamata Banerjee as the alternative," he said. Speaking to TOI, Bandopadhyay said: "Whatever I had to say I have done it at the party workers' conference at University Institute Hall on September 15. It's my personal opinion that has been published in the party paper. I have nothing to add to it." Bandyopadhyay added that his words reflected his assessment after talking to a cross-section of people on the sidelines of his visits to four states over the last month as part of parliamentary standing committee teams. "They feel Mamata Banerjee can steer the nation," he said. This, however, didn't come as a surprise. Eleven days ago, emerging out of a nine-hour ED questioning at its Delhi office, TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee interestingly had singled out Congress when he said Trinamool will take on BJP head-on, and unlike others (mentioning Congress specifically once) will not "sell their spines or hide in homes". Even before Parliament's monsoon session, Trinamool floor leaders in the Lok Sabha, Bandyopadhyay and its leader in Rajya Sabha Derek O'Brien didn't attend any opposition meeting convened by Rahul. The party had, instead, sent its MPs. Reasoning why TMC chose to skip some opposition meetings, party MP Saugata Roy had said, "The Trinamool supremo had espoused the need for all parties opposed to BJP's divisive and communal politics to come together. TMC believes in opposition unity. But it isn't axiomatic that there will always be a joint approach, it will be merit-based. We have made our position clear both inside and outside Parliament." Roy had added that TMC stood on a different footing, having fought and defeated BJP on its own in Bengal. TMC isn't the only party that has questioned Congress. NCP leader Sharad Pawar had a week ago remarked on the Congress as "zamindars who can't control their havelis". On August 20, Mamata had stressed at a virtual meeting of 19 opposition parties that parties who were not allied to Congress should also be part of the opposition bloc against BJP. Her statement came in the backdrop of several regional parties either choosing to skip the meeting or were not invited. According to sources, parties that were either not invited or chose to give the two-and-a-half-hour meeting a miss were BSP, AAP, MiM and parties opposed to Congress like TRS, BJD and YSR Congress.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mamata-not-rahul-only-alternative-to-modi-says-trinamool-mouthpiece/articleshow/86309169.cms||---

While the inflow of water into the Hirakud reservoir from Chhattisgarh has been gradually waning, the outflow of water from the Mundali barrage near Cuttack at its peak would be below eight lakh cubic foot per second (cusec) early on Saturday. With the exception of Subarnarekha, the water level of all the other major rivers in the state is going down. Confirming the development, special relief commissioner (SRC) Pradeep Kumar Jena, said, “There may not be a major problem in the Mahanadi river system. The flow of water from the Mundali barrage on Saturday morning would be a little more than 7.5 lakh cusec, but far less than eight lakh cusec, which will not lead to an alarming situation.” At 12 noon on Friday, the strength of discharge of water at Mundali was around 6.49 lakh cusec. Jena said with no significant rain in the last 24 hours, the quantity of water flowing into the Hirakud reservoir has reduced from five lakh cusec to 4.70 lakh cusec. The reservoir is discharging 4.84 lakh cusec through its 28 sluice gates. Among other rivers, the level of water is receding in Baitarani, Brahmani Budhabalanga and Jalaka. Subarnarekha is the only river where the water level is still rising. This may cause flood in the low-lying areas of Bhogarai and Baliapal in Balasore. The district administration is prepared to tackle any such eventuality, Jena said. The SRC sent a message to the district collectors asking them to remain alert in view of the IMD’s fresh prediction of heavy rain for the next three days. He, however, said there is no reason to worry about the rain likely to be triggered by the cyclonic circulation over the Bay of Bengal. The IMD has issued a yellow warning for the strong possibility of torrential rain at one or two places in Bhadrak, Balasore and Mayurbhanj on Saturday. For Sunday, it has predicted heavy rain in Jajpur, Kendrapada, Cuttack, Jagatsinghpur, Khurda, Puri, Nayagarh, Dhenkanal, Keonjhar, Sundargarh, Kandhamal, Malkangiri and Koraput besides these three other districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/cuttack/govt-downgrades-flood-threat-after-water-flow-into-hirakud-decreases/articleshow/86313974.cms||---

---||Surat||Spiralling freight cost a global phenomenon: Goyal||Surat: Describing shortage of containers and the spiralling freight costs as an international phenomena in the post-pandemic times, Union industries minister Piyush Goyal claimed that the government has limited role in this role to play in the demand-driven market. “However, government departments concerned are closely monitoring the situation and issuing necessary instructions to departments. I held meetings with railway and shipping ministries and discussed the issues and are looking into how we can play a role in cooling down the prices. We are also trying to bring transparency,” the minister told TOI on Friday. “After the second Covid wave there was a sudden increase in our exports and international trade. Therefore, the demand in India for containers as well as ships have increased,” explained Goyal, who also claimed that exporters and various trade associations have flagged off the issue multiple times in the past six months. In another query on exemption of pharma and chemical industries from Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products (RoDTEP) scheme, Goyal said, “Only two or three sectors have been requested to bear with us for a certain period and they have been exempted.” He expressed his happiness with the exporters on them being “so magnanimous that they have taken this gracefully” and that exports continue to rise. “India has never before exported 165 billion dollar between April to August. Our exporters are trying to meet the high targets,” he said. The minister further pointed out that many industries are being given significant support under the RoDTEP and Rebate of State and Central Taxes and Levies (RoSCTL) scheme as well. He said that the industry players have appreciated Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s efforts to reimburse indirect taxes. “Covid has been a trying time for all of us and there is a greater need to put our resources into healthcare infrastructure, providing vaccines to all eligible at scorching pace. All of these require resources and only a few sectors have been exempted for certain time,” Goyal added. The Union minister on a visit to the city on Friday participated in various events organised to mark the 71st birthday of PM Modi. After arriving in the city, Goyal attended a gift distribution ceremony for divyang children at the Disable Welfare Trust, and also examined a mega vaccination drive before he attended an interactive session with members of Southern Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Goyal also visited Surat Diamond Bourse, textile industries in Sachin and an exhibition on achievements of PM Modi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/spiralling-freight-cost-a-global-phenomenon-goyal/articleshow/86305165.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

---||Vijayawada||Are we to remain quiet if our orders are not implemented, NGT asks Andhra Pradesh govt||VIJAYAWADA: The National Green Tribunal, Chennai bench, on Thursday questioned the AP government on the need to dig the foundation of the Rayalaseema Lift Irrigation project site to prepare a detailed project report. Hearing the contempt petition filed by social activist Gavinolla Srinivas, the tribunal bench consisting of Justice K Ramakrishnan and expert member Dr K Satyagopal was reacting to the AP government’s submission, asking the AP government counsel, “Are we to remain helplessly quiet if our orders are not implemented?” The NGT bench was referring to the stay order in March 2020 on the construction of Rayalaseema Lift Irrigation Scheme, stating that environmental clearance is mandatory for going forward. The bench examined the affidavit filed by AP chief secretary Adityanath Das on September 15 who once again reiterated the government’s stance that the works undertaken at RLIS were related to survey and investigation for the preparation of DPR. He also claimed that the video evidence submitted by the Telangana government was ‘fabricated false evidence’ with a malafide intention to mislead the tribunal. Counsel representing AP, Venkata Ramani, sought that the petition to send officials to jail be quashed. “Should we bury the works carried out so far at the site? The tribunal needs to understand that the works were carried out in the interest of people,” the AP advocate argued and sought the issues between the states should be resolved through discussion and in federal spirit. The NGT posted the matter to September 21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/are-we-to-remain-quiet-if-our-orders-are-not-implemented-ngt-asks-ap/articleshow/86302300.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

---||Vadodara||Gujarat among top three states with fake currency seizures||VADODARA: Even if it embarrasses you when the roadside vendor holds your Rs500 note against the light to ascertain if its genuine, you cannot blame him. For, Gujarat has the earned the notoriety of having the third highest seizures of fake currency in the country after Maharashtra and West Bengal. In fact, last year the state topped the same list in fake currency seizures! A report on Crime in India in 2020 released by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) revealed that 32 persons were arrested last year in Gujarat in fake currency rackets. Large number of counterfeit seizures managed to keep the police on their toes. The police said that one of the reasons behind such high circulation of currency notes in the state is that it shares its border with Pakistan. “The neighbouring country often pumps in fake currency notes through the sea and land border that we share with it. The aim behind such racket is to destabilize the country’s economy,” said a senior police official. The cops also said that the state has several businesses that are cash rich and hence it becomes easier to circulate fake currency here. Many gangs also source fake currency notes from Malda district in West Bengal that is one of the hubs for such rackets. The Gujarat police have busted several such rackets wherein residents of West Bengal, who had sourced fake currency notes from Malda, travelled all the way to Gujarat to circulate it in the market. In 2020, Maharashtra topped the list of states with fake currency seizures as 38,664 fake currency notes of the value of Rs 2.63 crore were seized in the state. The police said that as compared to the previous years, fake currency circulation dropped in Gujarat in 2020 due to the lockdown and restrictions on the movement due to Covid. Trade bodies in the state keep organizing awareness programmes to ensure that businessmen and traders don’t fall victim to these rackets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/guj-among-top-three-states-with-fake-currency-seizures/articleshow/86304930.cms||Tushar Tere
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Aadhaar card, power use seeding to weed out bogus beneficiaries||AMARAVATI: In order to implement welfare schemes effectively, the state government has directed power distribution companies to ready a plan for Aadhaar seeding with electricity consumer numbers. The state government is likely to utilise electricity billing information to decide eligibility for implementation of welfare schemes. The government is unable to weed out bogus beneficiaries from welfare schemes for want of proof of their economic status. With field staff in many areas colluding with beneficiaries, removal of bogus beneficiaries either in Public Distribution System (PDS) or pensions has become a difficult task. Chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy is keen to ensure that not even a single eligible beneficiary is removed from welfare schemes. Although the CM’s decision to implement welfare schemes to saturation level is a good move, the presence of bogus beneficiaries in large numbers is bleeding the exchequer. Sources said linking Aadhaar number with electricity consumption data may help to ascertain the economic status of beneficiaries of welfare schemes. “Electricity consumption is one key area where we can ascertain the economic status of individuals. This data will help expose bogus beneficiaries, including Aarogyasri cards,” said a senior official. Source said that the beneficiaries with high electricity consumption would be removed from welfare schemes. Meanwhile, power utilities have started the exercise for linking consumer numbers with Aadhaar on the pretext of avoiding discrepancies in billing system. The discoms were also facing difficulty in transfer of connection in case of death of the original applicant to their legal heirs in the absence of data with the companies. The discoms were granting new connections based on copies of a property document.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/aadhaar-power-use-seeding-to-weed-out-bogus-beneficiaries/articleshow/86302058.cms||Samdani MN

The technology unveiled at the school, San Ramon Dougherty Valley Excessive College, in California, scans and detects any hidden lethal weapon such as guns or knives using artificial intelligence. ‘Specto’, as Sahil terms it, is a pair of shades that comes with a micro camera and a processing chip connected to it. “I set up school camera systems and was praised by the faculty. The software-based micro-camera system was unveiled at San Raman Dougherty Valley High School in California, where I studied, for the built-in object detection challenge,” Sahil explains. Tallam SahilThe young inventor says that he chose this as his first project after noticing the need for close surveillance and security arrangements in schools after a series of incidents in the US, where gun culture prevails. However, now, the youngster has already worked on developing the technology further to expand its utility for people suffering from visual and hearing impairment. He has developed the same glasses by additionally fixing an infrared sensor that is used to detect the proximity of objects nearby. Using the voice recognition commands and Google’s API vision that can translate text to speech, the glasses can also provide a reading experience. “The glasses can take a picture of a particular paper and then convert that text into speech for you to listen to later. If a blind person wears these glasses and stands at any bus stand, they will also be able to read the advertisements too,” Sahil adds. These aren’t the only invention that Sahil pioneered, he is currently working on a drone technology that can help Indian farmers identify fertile soil, especially in hilly areas for sowing their seeds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/telugu-teen-in-us-develops-tech-for-safety-in-schools/articleshow/86302137.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

Public health officials said more students from the nursing college were likely to test positive for the virus, while those infected had already been moved to the Covid care centre on the college campus itself. After schools and colleges were reopened, institutes were allowed to operate hostels as well with limited strength by ensuring social distancing among the students. Colleges were also instructed to allow students from Kerala only if they have RT-PCR negative certificate. District collector G S Sameeran said all the colleges and institutions were asked to keep students coming from Kerala in quarantine for a week to 10 days, before allowing them to mingle with other students. “We have asked them strictly ensure RT-PCR negative certificate and vaccination status of the students.” A health official said mandatory quarantine of students on their arrival could have prevented the Covid cluster in the nursing college. P Aruna, deputy director of health services, said four of the nursing students, who were among the first set of positive cases, were possessing RT-PCR negative certificates. “It takes three to 14 days for Covid symptoms to manifest after getting infected. Therefore, mandatory quarantine for a few days is the only way to prevent formation of such clusters. We have instructed educational institutions to adhere to the norms,” she said. Some colleges have asked students from other states to attend online classes from home for the time being, considering the high number of cases there. “Roughly, 40 students of our college are from Kerala. We have suggested them to attend the online classes from home,” said principal of an arts and science college in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/pandemic-fear-college-hostels-under-scanner/articleshow/86306152.cms||---

Ruling party legislator Jogi Ramesh’s vehicle was damaged, while former MLC Budha Venkanna fell unconscious while trying to stop the jostling between the two groups. Police had to resort to lathicharge to disperse the warring mob. Trouble started when YSRC cadre led by Ramesh reached Naidu’s bungalow and squatted on the road outside. They started shouting slogans demanding Naidu to come out and tender an apology for the comments made by former minister Ch Ayyanna Patrudu against chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy. Some stones were also hurled into Naidu’s bungalow, which led to clashes. Meanwhile, Naidu wrote to Jagan on the newly-formed TTD trust board, and demanded its termination to “safeguard the sanctity of the biggest Hindu temples conglomerate in the world”. Charging the government of turning the trust board into a “political asylum”, Naidu said by nominating persons with criminal background, the government has hurt the sentiments of Lord Venkateswara’s devotees. “No government in the past appointed a TTD trust board with so many members. Many undeserving persons have been nominated to the trust board which is unfortunate,” the former CM wrote. Hitting back at Naidu, TTD chairman YV Subba Reddy said, “The new trust board has only 25 member trustees and four ex-officio members. The previous board also had the same strength. Only the number of special invitees has increased as the government wants to give opportunity to more people to serve Lord Venkateswara.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/tdp-ysrc-cadre-clash-outside-naidus-residence/articleshow/86302355.cms||Samdani MN

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh ranks third in cases booked against police||VIJAYAWADA: Cases registered against police personnel increased by 135% in Andhra Pradesh last year compared to 2019, according to the Crime in India 2020 report released by National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). It may be recollected that last year AP police admitted that they had erroneously submitted false data to NCRB and that the total cases against cops were 111, and not 1,681. Going by the state government’s declared figure, that number has now risen by 261 this year, making AP third in the country after Maharashtra. Assam tops the list with 2,179 cases, which according to many SCRB experts could be another mistake in submitting data as the state had only 397 cases in 2019. Out of the 261 cases, 70 cases have been chargesheeted, 159 of them are arrested, 17 cases saw the final report being submitted, eight cases have been withdrawn while 10 of them were quashed by the courts. Yet again, there were zero convictions while the acquittal rate stood at 100% in all the six cases that were disposed by the courts. In Andhra Pradesh’s case, 31% of the cases were related to cops colluding with liquor and sand smugglers, according to the Special Enforcement Bureau (SEB) data. Overall, 240 government employees have been booked and police personnel alone account for 33%. AP accounts for five per cent of overall cases booked against police personnel in India. However, most of these cases registered against the police personnel have nothing to do with human rights violations as they all fall under the ‘others’ category. But the most notable case against police personnel happened to be the abetment to suicide case against Nandyal circle inspector Somasekhara Reddy and head constable Gangadhar. Reddy and Gangadhar were alleged to have tortured a family, according to a dying declaration given in a selfie video by Abdul Salaam and his family. Another dubious distinction in the state is that of custodial deaths with AP ranking second in the country after Gujarat in NCRB’s 2020 report. A total of eight persons died in police custody last year of which six happened to be remand prisoners. Six of them occurred due to illness while one was reported as suicide and another one while escaping custody. Out of these eight cases, a magisterial inquiry was ordered in only one case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ap-ranks-third-in-cases-booked-against-police/articleshow/86302195.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti
---||Business||Happy in hometown, not hurrying to office||MUMBAI: With the fully vaccinated share of the workforce expanding, organisations may call their employees back to offices while adopting new work models. However, staffing companies said there is a section of the migrant population that is unlikely to return to the cities where they used to work pre-pandemic. These roles may either continue to be carried out remotely or filled in by local talent. Adecco India CMD Vidya Sagar Gannamani told TOI around 15% of those who migrated to their hometowns are considering permanently residing there as they benefit from the lower cost of living. Additionally, their hometowns are less congested compared to bigger towns and they benefit from the improved infrastructure and connectivity that is now available in smaller cities. Nearly 70% of the migrant workforce is in the junior to mid-management levels, according to Adecco. At the senior management level, the number is 10-15%. Many mid-sized and large businesses have extended their operations to tier-2 and -3 cities due to the growing availability of local talent, cost arbitrage, competitive wages, reasonable real estate prices, and lower cost of operations. A study on the workforce distribution of Adecco India’s employees and associates indicates that more than 60% of those who migrated to their hometowns want to extend their stay temporarily. They want to ride out the pandemic since they are now closer to their extended families and can seek career opportunities from far-flung locations, which was not an option before. “The crisis is unleashing economic, behavioural, and structural changes that are forcing both employers and employees to rethink all aspects of workforce management — from supply chains to distributed work. It is also creating a unique chance to embed inclusive workforce practices from top to bottom. During the pandemic, most companies succeeded in engaging the full talents and abilities of their workforce via remote working practices, while they migrated back to their hometowns,” said Gannamani. According to Quess Corp, hiring trends in metro cities are seeing an upward surge, which indicates high demand in these geographies. The year-on-year trend for metros highlights the huge demand for professionals, mainly due to the IT/ITeS industry. Quess Corp MD & group CEO Suraj Moraje said, “Since most IT companies continue to work in remote mode even now, it’s difficult to state if the migrant working population has returned to cities. Once companies ask their employees to report to work locations, we may see workers moving back to metros. Also, new hires may be instructed to work from office instead of working from home.” “With vaccination drives being carried out at a rapid pace, companies are planning to recall up to 25% of manpower currently working from home, in adherence to government norms,” Moraje added. Wipro has already started the process of return to office in a staggered manner, while TCS has indicated acting similarly, depending on the number of Covid cases. Industry sources said employees working remotely in their hometowns may have to be given some time to relocate back, gas they would have to rent a house to begin with. On the other hand, 70% of the migrant labour at the bottom of the pyramid — who typically work in manufacturing, supply chain, construction, e-commerce and retail — have returned to the cities, said CIEL HR Services CEO Aditya Mishra. “Opportunities for them in their home towns are limited and some of them get used to the work environment and the lifestyle in the cities. Hence, the cities will always attract people from the small towns and villages,” said Mishra. Among those who haven’t returned back to the cities, Mishra believes 10% are likely to remain in their hometowns and search for livelihoods there. “Construction in residential buildings, hotels, tourism and travel hasn’t gained momentum and hence the demand isn’t fully back yet. As a result, there is no remarkable shortage of people in the cities,” said Mishra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/happy-in-hometown-not-hurrying-to-office/articleshow/86307044.cms||Namrata Singh

---||Business||Munich Re tightens underwriting for life covers||Mumbai: Underwriting practices for high-value term insurance is set to get more stringent with Munich Re asking insurance companies to tighten processes. Many of these changes are likely to come into effect from October. Munich Re is a dominant reinsurer of life business in India accounting for more than three-fourth of reinsured life business. The German giant saw increased claims in the second wave of the pandemic due to the Delta variant. While insurers do not revise pricing following an incident, term insurance rates were already very low in India due to competition and the current surge in claims might trigger a correction of the declining trend over a decade. According to insurers, reinsurers can put conditions both in respect of medical as well as financial underwriting. In medical underwriting, the insurer needs to make sure that there are no underlying conditions that increase risk. While in the case of financial underwriting, insurers check whether the applicant has enough income to justify a high value cover. The medical underwriting is being made more stringent by reducing the bar at which insurers insist on a full medical check for accepting the proposal. The bar will similarly increase for income levels. “Now lenders may ask for bank statements in addition to salary statements, or they might ask salary proof for more months than in the past,” said an insurer. Last month, following its second-quarter results, Munich Re said that it has doubled its earlier estimate for Covid-related claims in life and health for 2021. The reinsurer said that its life and health business saw 302 million euros of claims in the first half of 2021 as compared to 105 million euros in the same period last year. It has increased its full-year estimate to 400 million euros. In its earnings call, the company said that the second quarter had seen a material increase in claims from South Africa and India. In the call, the company’s chief financial officer said that the Delta variant had led to claims in India and South Africa that exceeded expectations. The reinsurer had paid out 4 billion euros of claims because of the pandemic including event cancellation and business interruption.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/munich-re-tightens-underwriting-for-life-covers/articleshow/86307406.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Business||PNB, BoB too reduce home loan rates||MUMBAI: Soon after a rate cut by State Bank of India (SBI), other public sector lenders Punjab National Bank (PNB) and Bank of Baroda (BoB) have also revised their home loan rates under festival offers. While PNB’s home loan starts at 6.6%, for Bank of Baroda it is 6.75%. PNB has cut the interest rate on home loans above Rs 50 lakh by 50 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point). The bank will offer credit score-linked home loans starting from 6.6% irrespective of any upper ceiling limit. The rate is applicable to balance transfer cases and is the lowest among public sector banks. PNB is already offering a full waiver of service charges and processing fees on most personal loans under a festival bonanza offer. The bank’s car loan starts from 7.15% and personal loan to public from 8.95%. Bank of Baroda is offering waiver of 0.25% in the existing applicable rates for its home and car loans across the board. In addition, the lender is offering waiver of processing fee in home loans. Following the reduction, home loan rates start at 6.75% and car loan rates at 7%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/pnb-bob-too-reduce-home-loan-rates/articleshow/86307121.cms||---
---||Business||BoI, Union Bank, PNB may gain most from bad bank||Mumbai: The National Asset Reconstruction Company (NARCL) will have maximum impact on loan books of Bank of India (BoI), Union Bank and Punjab National Bank (PNB), which will sell over 1% of their loans to the bad bank. According to rating agency Crisil, the bad bank, or NARCL, will lower the NPA level of banks by 20-25% over time. However, the immediate impact on the bottom line will be limited as lenders who sell loans in the first phase will receive just around Rs 2,700 crore upfront cash payment as against the Rs 90,000 crore of bad loans they sell to the corporation. Also, investing in the security receipts issued by NARCL will not increase the capital requirement of banks due to the government guarantee. Of the Rs 2 lakh crore of bad loans to be transferred to NARCL, around Rs 30,600 crore will be guaranteed for five years. NARCL will pay 15% of whatever amount the loans are valued at, in cash. The remaining 85% will be paid using security receipts. According to a Jefferies report, the government guarantee will keep the security capital neutral as without the guarantee banks will have to set aside funds towards provisions. A sovereign guarantee being risk-free does not attract similar capital requirements. “For the guaranteed part, banks will recognise the value as an investment but that will not require any capital for 5 years as there is government guarantee. For non-guaranteed part, banks might not recognise value until actual recovery is made,” the Jefferies report said. According to the report, of the first lot, SBI will be transferring the biggest chunk of loans at Rs 20,000 crore. However, given the size, the sale will be only 0.8% of its loan book. While BoI, Union Bank and PNB will be selling much less at Rs 5,500 crore, Rs 7,800 crore and Rs 8,000 crore, their loans will be a much bigger chunk of their balance sheet. For BoI, the loans sold will be 1.5% of its book, 1.3% for Union Bank and 1.2% for PNB, Jefferies said. “The sovereign guarantee will cushion security receipt investors against potential lower recoveries. This could, in turn, potentially enable the development of a secondary market in security receipts, which has proved elusive so far,” said Crisil senior director and deputy chief ratings officer Krishnan Sitaraman. The loans sold to the bad bank include Rs 22,500-crore exposure to Videocon Oil Ventures, where SBI is the lead bank. Another large account is Union Bank-led account of Amtek Auto, which has Rs 9,014 crore of bank loans. IDBI is the lead banker in three large accounts — Reliance Naval, Jaypee Infra and GTL.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/boi-union-bank-pnb-may-gain-most-from-bad-bank/articleshow/86307257.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Vijayawada||KRMB asks Andhra Pradesh, Telangana to submit details of project staff||AMARAVATI: The Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) has directed the governments of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana to submit details of staff working in different irrigation projects listed in the gazette notification within 10 days. KRMB member B Ravi Kumar Pillai held discussions with officials of both the states in Hyderabad on Friday, and said he would make field visits if required to get a first-hand information about the projects. In the previous board meeting, KRMB had constituted a sub-committee headed by Pillai to oversee arrangements for implementation of the gazette notification. Pillai said the issue of deploying the CISF to guard the projects could be taken up for discussion at the next meeting. Asking AP and Telangana to submit details of contracts awarded in the recent past for modernisation of canals and irrigation projects, he said they needed details of all works to closely monitor their progress as well as the water releases. During Friday’s meeting, AP requested the sub-committee to exclude Banakacherla head regulator from the ambit of KRMB as it does not influence the water allocations of the two states in any way. Telangana officials opposed the request. AP also requested KRMB to accord permission for diversion of water through outlets upstream of the reservoirs as part of flood mitigation to avoid any untoward incidents which could lead to loss of lives and properties in the downstream of Prakasam barrage. AP said the water being diverted is only flood water, which otherwise would have gone waste into the sea and hence should not be accounted against the share of any individual state when all the reservoirs on the main stream are at surplus level. In a letter to the KRMB member secretary, AP irrigation engineer-in-chief C Narayana Reddy said all projects on Krishna river were brimming with waters and there is no way except for release of water into the sea. Contending that AP should be allowed to make use of surplus flood waters for diversion to other projects upstream, he said such diverted water should not be deducted from AP’s quota in Krishna waters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/krmb-asks-ap-t-to-submit-details-of-project-staff/articleshow/86302253.cms||Samdani MN

HDFC said its July disbursements were the highest ever in a non-quarter end month. “Growth in home loans came from both the affordable housing segment as well as high-end properties. We see an upside for the housing sector not just in the short term but also in the medium to long term,” its MD Renu Sud Karnad said. Home loan lenders have found the need for homes with larger and additional spaces are on rise as privacy is important for working professionals. “Pandemic has reinvigorated the importance of home ownership. The concept of work-from-home is also fuelling the need and creating a demand for larger spaces as a subset,” says Y Viswanatha Gowd, MD and CEO of LIC Housing Finance.. We are expecting a positive rub off in the realty space in the coming quarters with the overall economic sentiments improving further, Gowd added. Shriram Housing Finance disbursed higher fresh home loans from Rs 220 crore in the April-June quarter, to touch Rs 650-700 crore mark in July-September, 2021. Its MD & CEO Ravi Subramanian says “We have already reached the pre-Covid levels of disbursement of loans, and thus, will focus on expanding business in tier 2 and 3 cities going forward.” In August, M&M Finance recorded a 57% YoY growth in disbursement at Rs 2,150 crore. Indiabulls Housing Finance said fresh loan disbursements have picked up pace from July, registering impressive growth month-on-month. In August, it disbursed about Rs 550 Cr of retail loans and expected to disburse about Rs 750 Cr of retail loans in September. Another NBFC, IIFL Finance saw its monthly disbursements go up to over Rs 2000 crore, which is slightly higher than pre pandemic levels.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/fresh-loan-disbursements-by-nbfcs-reach-pre-covid-levels-in-april-june/articleshow/86304107.cms||Mamtha Asokan
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh HC directs eatery premises be handed back to its management||VIJAYAWADA: The high court on Friday dismissed the appeal petition filed by Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Development Authority (VMRDA) challenging the single judge order on eviction of Fusion Foods restaurent. The division bench of the court, headed by Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice Ninala Jayasurya, directed officials to give possession of the premises to Fusion Foods management within seven days.  VMRDA, on November 15 last year, forcefully evicted the restaurant situated on its property, stating that the management got hold of the lease in an illegal manner. Challenging the eviction, Harshavardhan moved the high court, arguing that VMRDA did not follow due procedure in evicting him. He said the lease ran till 2025, and the notices were never handed over to him and were pasted on the wall only a day before the eviction, which was Diwali. The next day, a Sunday, VMRDA officials arrived with men and machinery to evict them from the property without giving him any opportunity to vacate or contend the notices, which is a violation of contractual agreements and his fundamental rights. The high court single judge found fault in the manner the restaurant was evicted. While observing that there was no need to carry out the eviction on a Sunday, a day after pasting the notices, the judge said deploying police for eviction of property was also a procedural violation. The court directed VMRDA to hand over possession of the restaurant to Harshavardan within seven days, and also asked the urban body to pay Rs 25,000 to the petitioner in lieu of costs. Challenging the orders, VMRDA moved an appeal petition in the high court, which upheld the orders of the single judge on Friday and directed to give possession of the restaurant to the petitioner within seven days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hc-directs-eatery-premises-be-handed-back-to-its-mgmt/articleshow/86302391.cms||Srikanth Aluri
---||Goa||Goa open for visitors, ready to start tourism, says CM Pramod Sawant||PANAJI: Chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Friday that the government has written to the Union ministries of home affairs and external affairs to give special permission to allow charter flights into the tourist state. “Goa is ready to start tourism and is open to welcome tourists. I think ours is the first state to welcome tourists during the pandemic,” said Sawant. Goa’s charter season kickstarts in September-October and winds up by May-end, bringing in about 2.5 lakh travellers. The state receives around 8-9 lakh international travellers, mostly comprising free independent travellers. Goa receives charter flights from mostly Russian destinations, apart from the UK and a few European countries. However, since the pandemic and owing to the ban on international commercial flights, Goa did not receive a single charter flight last season. Recently, the state was applauded by PM Narendra Modi after the state government claimed it achieved 100% first dose vaccination. “I would like to appeal to all of you to spread the message that Goa is ready to welcome tourists,” Sawant said. Barring travellers from Kerala, he said that the Goa government allows entry to people who have taken both doses of vaccine. Travellers from Kerala are required to produce an Covid-negative RT-PCR certificate to enter Goa, and also have to undergo five days of mandatory quarantine. Sawant also said that different programmes would be organised for tourists. Meanwhile, the curfew imposed by the state will remain in force till Monday morning. The coastal areas of the state are already crowded with domestic tourists, especially from the neighbouring states of Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Andhra Pradesh. In fact, even before the state relaxed curfew conditions, Goa has been seeing a steady flow of tourists since July. While domestic tourists have increased occupancy of starred hotels, smaller hotels that traditionally relied on charters have remained shut for a year and a half. The travel and tourism association of Goa (TTAG) has been lobbying since last season that as a special case, the government of India should have bubbles with Goa’s charter destinations as after mining, it is the hospitality industry that has been the main support of the state’s economy. The TTAG has also been demanding that now the state’s Covid case positivity rate has dropped below 5%, all kinds of tourist activities should be resumed. The government is yet to allow operations of casinos and river cruises, both major attractions among domestic tourists. Recently, science and technology minister Michael Lobo said that he requested Sawant to allow casinos to reopen at least 50% capacity, by following all Covid protocols. If casinos restart, tourist footfalls will increase and it will revive the hospitality sector, Lobo said. Annually, Goa receives around 80 lakh tourists, and until pandemic, the sector had witnessed healthy growth.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-open-for-visitors-ready-to-start-tourism-says-sawant/articleshow/86306160.cms||---

At the 45th GST Council meeting in Lucknow on Friday, finance minister Buggana Rajendranath said AP has been opposed to the move right from the beginning. Asking the Centre and the GST Council to honour the states’ rights under the federal structure, he said the revenues of the states under GST regime do not match the revenues under VAT. “The states have lost over 5% of revenue because of GST. While earlier the revenue used to witness an average annual growth of 14-15%, under GST it has stayed around 10%. The last two years also saw a fall in tax revenues due to the pandemic,” he said, while urging the Centre to provide additional funds in the form of compensation to support the states. The finance minister further stated that as per existing notifications and the proposals of the fitment committee constituted by the GST Council, the rate of tax applicable to polished napa stone is 18%. Pointing out that for similar low-end stones produced in other states, such as Kota stone of Rajasthan, the tax rate is 5% except those with mirror finish, he called for GST to be reduced on napa slabs on par with Kota stone. — Gopi Dara||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ap-opposes-gst-on-petrol-diesel/articleshow/86302220.cms||Gopi Dara

The car, with chassis number # 6UE, was bought by Kipling much after he had returned to England from India. He used the car for six years before selling it to Kumar Ganga Dhar Bagla in London in 1927. Bagla transported it back to his estates in Kolkata the same year. Since then, the car has remained in the possession of the family as part of its “Debottar” estate that was founded by the grand sire, Raja Raibahadur Shew Bux Bagla, in 1884. The estate has a number of Satyanarayan temples built across the country, including Bengal, Gujarat and Rajasthan. Rudyard Kipling in the carKeeping the chassis and engine intact, the car’s body has now been remodelled into a chariot with a throne in which the family takes its Lord Krishna for a ride twice a year — once before Holi and then on the 18th day after his “birth” on Janmashtami, which usually falls in Bhadra. Friday happened to be that second day and coincided with Vishwakarma Puja. The car, with chassis number # 6UE, was bought by Kipling much after he had returned to England from India. “The car turned 100 this year,” said owner Lalit Bagla (80). The family also has pictures of how the car looked at the time of sale and one where Kipling is seen in it. Vintage car collector and restorer Shrivardhan Kanoria said Rolls Royce maintains the names of owners against chassis numbers in its records. “It is a Hooper limousine. Rolls makes the chassis, engine and dashboard and then collaborates with body makers like Hooper,” said Kanoria, the founder president of Eastern India Motoring Group, a city-based vintage car owners’ group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kiplings-rolls-royce-goes-for-a-spin-with-krishna/articleshow/86303440.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

---||Kolkata||Kolkata Municipal Corporation plans to plant 16,000 saplings across 16 boroughs to make up for Amphan loss||KOLKATA: The KMC parks department will plant 16,000 saplings, a bulk of them of fruit-bearing trees, across the city to compensate for the loss incurred during Cyclone Amphan last year. Mango, guava, kala jamun, wax apple (jamrul) and jackfruit are among the fruit trees that will be planted across the 16 boroughs. In addition, trees like krishnachura, radhachura, kadam and jarul will also be planted, according to horticulturists associated with the project. While the plantation will make up for a good portion of the 18,000 trees uprooted in Amphan, environmentalists feel at least 1 lakh trees have to be planted to compensate for the loss as one out of five saplings survive and develop into a full-grown tree. A KMC parks department study revealed that the number of birds had increased in neighbourhoods like Northern Avenue (Tallah area), Deshbandhu Park, Southern Avenue and Rabindra Sarobar, which had fruit trees. Local residents can now spot a wide variety of birds, including woodpeckers, parrots, mynahs and bulbuls. Recalling a similar initiative by KMC parks department a decade ago, horticulturist Ranjit Samanta lauded the initiative. It was under Samanta’s supervision that KMC had planted several fruit-bearing trees. On Friday, Samanta said he feels delighted whenever he sees the 100-odd mango trees he had planted around a playground beside Tallah Park in 2011 in full bloom. “The trees attract birds and local residents enjoy ripe mangoes in summer,” he said. Environmentalist Arjan Basu Roy also welcomed the civic move, but he stressed on the need for an appropriate space for planting fruit-bearing and other species of trees under the supervision of experts. “Selection of space is very important. Among the fruit-bearing trees, I would prefer guava, naseberry (chiku) and blueberry (falsa) if we need to attract birds as these trees need a smaller space compared to large species of fruit-bearing trees,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmc-plans-to-plant-16000-saplings-across-16-boroughs-to-make-up-for-amphan-loss/articleshow/86303477.cms||Saikat Ray

The SEC has directed district collectors to gear up to complete the process of counting of ballots without any trouble. The ballot boxes, which were kept in strong rooms in different places for over five months, will be taken out in the presence of the representatives of political parties. The collectors have asked returning officers to alert candidates and collect counting agent forms by Saturday. Meanwhile, chief secretary, Dr Adityanath Das, directed collectors and superintendents of police (SPs) to make fool-proof arrangements for the counting of votes on Sunday. He said no one should be allowed as counting staff or counting agent if they have not taken the Covid-19 vaccine. The chief secretary also directed the collectors to ensure the completion of vaccination of officials by Saturday. The chief secretary held a video-conference with the collectors and SPs from his camp office in Vijayawada. He asked the officials to enforce Section 144 of IPC in a radius of 100 meters around the counting stations. “Strictly enforce Covid-19 protocols at counting centres. No one should be allowed to breach the guidelines at any cost,” said the chief secretary. He asked the collectors and SPs to review the arrangements. He asked them to appoint senior officers as special officers in counting centres to guide counting officials. He directed the collectors to make joint collectors in-charges of the counting process and have them available to returning officers to clear their doubts from time to time. He said that measures should be taken not to allow crowds near the counting centres. He also asked the officials from the energy department to ensure uninterrupted power supply to counting centres till the completion of the counting of ballots. Principal secretary (panchayat raj), Gopalakrishna Dwivedi, asked panchayat raj commissioner to set up a round-the-clock control room to clear doubts over the counting of votes, if any. He said that officials from the panchayat raj department would be available to the district collectors and returning officers along with the State Election Commission (SEC) to clear their doubts during the counting of votes.

On Wednesday, Dibeynedu Das (34) sustained a cut in his neck from a kite string on the flyover and had to get 10 stitches. Das, an employee of a private firm based in Kolkata, takes this flyover to commute to and from his Khardah home. On Wednesday, he was on his way home on his bike around 5.45pm when he felt a slash in his neck and almost fell. He disentangled himself and rode 2km to Charnock Hospital. “He was profusely bleeding, but the cut was superficial. The injury could have been grievous if he had been helmetless,” said Charnock Hospital emergency medicine head Nishant Aggarwal. Bidhannagar City Police has started visiting marketplaces in and around Baguiati, Lake Town, Kestopur and the airport to ensure no Chinese manja is being sold. “For the last three days, we have been constantly monitoring the markets,” said an officer. Cops had also taken up taken up outreach activities and visited high-rises around the flyovers, asking people to avoid flying kites in the area. Sukanta Pal, a medical representative who regularly uses the flyover, felt there was need for better vigilance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kite-concerns-on-vip-rd-as-one-injured-by-manja/articleshow/86303293.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The lower primary school in Barigidadadoddi in Lingasugur is tucked away in a remote village with just 35 households. Chandru Kabbalageri drew inspiration from the musical fountain he saw at Almatti Dam in Bagalkot, and decided to replicate it at the school. Kabbalageri is both headmaster and teacher at the school, which is nearly 90km from the district headquarters. Kabbalageri started working on the park early in 2020 and completed the project before the end of the year. He coughed up a considerable portion of the funds required for the project from his own pocket. The fountains have been placed inside shapes such as triangles, squares, rectangles and circles. The water jets and streams sway to patriotic Kannada songs and devotional songs. “It helps in explaining concepts to the children, since classes are yet to resume for primary classes,” he said. He started working at the school since 2002, and has been spending nearly Rs 20,000 almost every year on adding something to the school. “Since schools were closed during the lockdown, I saw it as an opportunity to develop a park based on a theme. The park has alphabets and numerals scribbled at a few places. Students of primary school like to play while learning. That was the reason I decided to install more playing equipment. Going ahead, I am planning on installing swings at the park,” Kabbalageri told TOI. The fountain, he said, was developed using valves and a control panel. Kabbalageri said that the water could stream in from different ways in harmony with the music being played on the record. The park, he proudly said, had turned into a centre for attraction for the children and makes them more eager to come to the school. “Since classes are yet to start for the children, we enjoy a fun session before I go to the village and impart my lessons. The students are more attentive now, after the park was developed,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/lone-teacher-of-govt-school-develops-a-park-with-a-musical-fountain/articleshow/86301047.cms||Shreyas HS

The Board has now similarly announced a change in the evaluation pattern for Class IX and XI students during this year. The idea is to ensure that assessment is done throughout the year, so that if conventional exams cannot be held due to the pandemic it is still possible to fairly evaluate students. The Board has said that for Class IX and XI students there will be a first term exam, instead of the second quarterly exam. Similarly, there will be a second term exam, replacing the fourth test. Both the first and second term exams will be held out of 40 marks each. The exam will be either in the form of multiple choice questions or in the form of subjective type questions. Students will be allotted project and assignment work of ten marks each and they will be assessed for another 20 marks for year round internal assessment. Altogether, the internal assessment component will comprise of 40 marks. For subjects with practical component too, there will be project work of 10 marks, besides 10 marks for year round assessment. “Portion of first term shall be of first quarterly and second quarterly test and the second term shall be of third quarterly and fourth quarterly. The final result to be prepared accordingly in line with the scheme of Class X and XII,” the Board has said. Marks of the first term as well as the second term examination will contribute to the final overall score of the student. When announcing the policy for Class X and XII assessment for 2021-22, Goa Board had said, “Goa Board had to cancel Class X and Class XII board exams of 2020-2021 as it was risky to conduct them in the second wave in April 2021. The results of both were declared on the basis of objective, flexible and valid alternative assessment policy. This, in turn, also necessitated deliberations over alternative ways to look at the learning objectives.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/modified-assessment-pattern-for-class-ix-xi-for-2021-22-goa-board/articleshow/86306198.cms||---
---||Kochi||‘Bishop a scholarly person, terrorists raking up row’||Kottayam: As pressure mounted on the LDF government to lend an ear over the concerns raised by the bishop of Pala diocese of Syro-Malabar Church Mar Joseph Kallarangatt, cooperation minister V N Vasavan held talks with the bishop as the government’s emissary on Friday. Vasavan, former CPM Kottayam district secretary, conveyed to the bishop the government’s stand regarding the ‘narcotic jihad’ issue, sources said. The minister, who has a good rapport with the bishop, held talks for around 40 minutes at the Bishop’s House. The government’s move was subsequent to the mediatory talks initiated by Congress leaders on Thursday. Speaking to reporters at the Bishop’s House, Vasavan said that it was only a ‘friendly visit’ and had not come as a representative of the government. Vasavan said that the Bishop is a “scholarly person” and it is the “terrorists” who are trying to make the ‘narcotic jihad’ reference of the Bishop into a controversy. Vasavan said that he used to listen keenly to the speeches of the bishop who has a very deep knowledge of the Bible, Quran, Ramayana and Bhagavad Gita. The government has given a message through this reaction of the minister that it will not desert the bishop in the face of the controversy. Vasavan made it clear that the present situation does not demand holding conciliatory talks. However, strict action will be taken against those who create divisions in the society through social media platforms. He also said that nobody will be allowed to break the peaceful atmosphere in the state. Later, speaking to TOI, Vasavan said that the chief minister had declared the government’s stand earlier and he had only reiterated it to the bishop. “The government has decided to strengthen its cyber police wing as attempts are made to create a communal divide through social media. This will not be allowed,” he said. The chief minister had ruled out any move to register a case against the Pala bishop on the ‘narcotic jihad’ remark a few days ago. Meanwhile, Congress has intensified its efforts to bring the representatives of two groups on a common platform for talks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/bishop-a-scholarly-person-terrorists-raking-up-row/articleshow/86303898.cms||Jaikrishnan Nair

The accused, Milind Birje, was a public servant, working as a clerk at time keeper office in Poddar Mill. He had initially sought a bribe of Rs 2,000. Refusing to grant him leniency, the court observed that corruption by public servants has become a gigantic problem. “No facet of public activity has been left unaffected by the stink of corruption. It has a deep and pervasive impact on the functioning of the entire country. Large-scale corruption retards the nation- building activities and everyone has to suffer on that count,” the court said. Birje, who is out on bail, was also fined Rs 10,000. “So, keeping in view the nature and gravity of the offence, other circumstances of the case, in my considered opinion, a minimum sentence is just and proper to pass against the accused which would meet the end of justice,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/clerk-gets-4-years-ri-for-accepting-rs-1500-bribe/articleshow/86306243.cms||---

The BJP in Dakshina Kannada district launched ‘Seva Samarpan Abhiyan’ as part of Modi’s birthday, and 20 years of public life from becoming the chief minister of Gujarat in 2001. A protest was held near the Clock Tower in the city, under the leadership of Dakshina Kannada District Youth Congress president Luqman Bantwal. The protesters put up ‘Modi Tea Stall’ and ‘Amit Shah Pakoda Stall’ as a token of protest, held as part of the call given by the Indian Youth Congress across the country. Protesters urged the central and state governments to create employment opportunities. Former minister B Ramanath Rai, AICC secretary Ivan D’Souza, former MLA B A Mohiuddin Bava, corporators Shashidhar Hegde, Abdul Ravoof and others spoke about the failures of the central and state governments with regard to employment creation. Rai said that the Prime Minister has been working towards the privatisation of the public sector to help capitalists. “People are put to hardship due to the rise in price of essential commodities. Through the privatisation of the public sector, the government is adding to the people’s burden. BJP came to power in India with the promise of employment and control over prices. They promised two crore jobs a year, and reduction of petroleum prices. However, they have neither controlled the rise in price of petroleum products, nor essential commodities,” Rai said. Meanwhile, the district also witnessed various programmes to mark the birthday of the Prime Minister at various places. BJP state president Nalin Kumar Kateel offered Rudrabhisheka at Kadri Manjunatha temple in the city for Modi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/bjp-celebrates-pms-bday-cong-cook-pakodas-on-streets/articleshow/86301409.cms||---
---||Delhi||Selective Campaign Against Me: Top Cop||New Delhi: Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana informed Delhi High Court that there was a sustained social media campaign against him and the legal challenge to his appointment was an “abuse of process of law, based on malice” to derail his career. He added that the forum of the high court was being abused “either for some personal vendetta or as a proxy war on behalf of some undisclosed rival/interest”. In an affidavit in the case where the Centre had defended his appointment, the police chief pointed out that ever since he was appointed CBI special director, proceedings were being consistently filed against him by certain organisations as part of a “selective campaign”. Naming Common Cause and Centre for Public Interest Litigation, Asthana stated they existed only for filing litigations as public service. One or two individuals ran both the organisations enjoying deep and pervasive control over them. “Individuals running them in the recent past for some oblique and ostensible undisclosed reason have started a barrage of selective actions against me either out of some vendetta about which I’m not aware or at the behest of some individual/interest,” claimed the affidavit, adding that this was vendetta or a proxy war projected under the PIL cloak. Urging HC to dismiss the petitions, Asthana contended, “Not only the process of law was abused, but there was a sustained social media campaign that corroborates and justifies the apprehension of the deponent.” The affidavit was filed in response to the PIL by Sadre Alam, a lawyer, who had sought quashing of the July 27 order issued by Union ministry of home affairs appointing Asthana as the Delhi Police commissioner as also the order granting inter-cadre deputation as well as extension of service to him just before his superannuation on July 31. Asthana said the merits and demerits of his appointment could only be dealt with by the central government. The Centre had submitted that Asthana’s appointment was done in public interest, keeping in mind the diverse law and order challenges faced by the national capital. It said his service tenure was also extended in public interest, in exercise of the powers vested in the cadre controlling authority. It added that the PIL, as well as the intervention of CPIL, “deserves to be dismissed with exemplary costs”. The petition contended that the high-powered committee comprising the Chief Justice of India, Prime Minister and the Leader of Opposition, in its meeting held on May 24, had rejected the attempt to appoint Asthana as CBI director on the basis of the six-month rule as laid down by Supreme Court in the Prakash Singh case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/selective-campaign-against-me-top-cop/articleshow/86303903.cms||Abhinav Garg

---||Nagpur||NMC regularized unauthorized layout, plots for 20 months without authority||Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) regularized unauthorized layout, plots and sanctioned building plans under the Gunthewari Act for nearly 20 months, without having the power to do so. To avoid inconvenience to people, the state government has reportedly assured to come up with a plan where the decisions taken by the civic body will be regularized. This problem came to fore in a letter sent by municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B to state’s urban development department (UDD) a few days ago. The civic chief wrote, “Government appointed NIT as planning authority for control and regularization under Gunthewari Act on December 6, 2002. The government had given powers of planning authority of seven schemes of NIT to NMC on August 27, 2019. Then, the government on April 9, 2021, again made NIT planning authority for seven schemes. There is no clarity on the planning authority for areas under Gunthewari Act. Therefore, we are expecting clarity from the government,” he said. In the same letter, Radhakrishnan has given reference of a meeting held between officials of UDD, NMC and NIT. Officials told TOI, “NMC was made sole planning authority of the city. Also, NIT sent all files pending under the Gunthewari Act. Therefore, NMC undertook regularization.” In the meeting, principal secretary of UDD made it clear NMC was not given power to regularize unauthorized layouts and plots under Gunthewari Act. UDD directed NMC to send list of layouts and plots on which NMC took decision between August 27, 2019, and April 9, 2021. Accordingly, NMC has sent the list. The government is chalking out a plan to regularize decisions taken by NMC. As per list sent to the government, the civic body has regularized one unauthorized layout at mouza Hazaripahad and 1,244 unauthorized plots, and sanctioned building plans on 2,140 regularized plots in 20 months. NMC earned revenue of Rs106.73 crore from these decisions. Though NMC is yet to receive any reply in writing from the government, it has reportedly transferred all files to NIT, which has resumed its service. West Nagpur MLA Vikas Thakre, also city Congress president, said it is a major irregularity and violation by NMC officials so action should be taken against all responsible officials. “BJP-led government had placed people in problem by taking confused decisions. Such situation would have never arisen had the government taken proper decision in 2019. NIT was not dissolved despite big announcements. Our government will regularize all decisions of NMC in the interest of people. It will cause problems if the people will have to again complete process and pay charges. NMC should transfer charges of Rs106.73 crore to NIT as soon as possible,” he said. BJP city president Pravin Datke, also MLC, said, “NIT chairman and municipal commissioner are IAS officers and responsible to interpret the government’s directives and give services. I don’t want to enter into any politics. Dissolution of NIT is the only solution to put an end to all these problems. Therefore, all public representatives should come on one platform and ensure dissolution of NIT.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-regularized-unauthorized-layout-plots-for-20-months-without-authority/articleshow/86301471.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

---||Ahmedabad||HC asks govt to reply on coal-to-gas shift||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Friday directed the state authorities to file appropriate reply in response to a PIL seeking reduction of air pollution by ensuring that industrial units operating with the use of coal should be shifted to natural gas. The PIL was filed by petitioner-advocate Amit Panchal citing high air pollution levels due to emissions from industrial units across the state and showing how Gujarat’s cities fare badly on environment front. He has sought HC directions to the authorities to “fix emission standards and parameters for industries so that pollution levels in the state are maintained within acceptable limits”. The petitioner has also urged the court to ask the government to ensure that “all industries/plants/sites be allowed to function only if they are operated on natural gas and not with the use of coal”. The demand is to identify and discontinue all polluting industrial units and to make alternative arrangements to immediately seize and stop using coal and to provide natural gas as fuel to the said industries to prevent and control air pollution. The petitioner has contended that burning of coal leads to emission of various pollutants in the form of gaseous as well as particulate matter. Air pollution across towns and cities in Gujarat is higher than permissible limits. Hence, there is an urgent need to identify units causing large-scale pollution. He has asserted that it is government’s duty to secure the right to life by providing a healthy environment. Sections 17 of The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 confers powers on the government to take preventive steps to curb air pollution. It can close, prohibit or regulate any industry, operation or process. The petitioner submitted that air pollution is a major global public health risk. A 2016 WHO study estimated 4.2 million deaths per year due to various diseases on account of high pollution. He cited the Central Pollution Control Board’s report which categorised Vadodara, Ankleshwar, Vapi and Bhavnagar as having ‘critically polluted’ air. Four other regions - Vatva, Ahmedabad, Rajkot, Morbi are identified as being ‘severely polluted’. Moreover, Ahmedabad, Surat and Vadodara find a place in the list of 122 ‘Non-Attainment Cities’ categorized by the ministry of environment, forest and climate change.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-asks-govt-to-reply-on-coal-to-gas-shift/articleshow/86303932.cms||---

Now the CPM has in a party report said that girls are being lured in campuses,” he said. Surendran asked what the CPM’s stand was regarding the Pala bishop saying that the influence of love jihad and narcotic jihad were on the rise in the state. “CPM should stop its double standards on the issue. There should be a proper investigation on the matter. The influence of terrorists is rising in the state and they are using love jihad to further their goals,” Surendran added. He added that the state government has adopting an anti-people stand by opposing the plans to include petroleum products under GST. “The CPM, which has been staging agitations against fuel price hike, is now scuttling attempts by the central government to reduce the price of petroleum products. Inclusion of petroleum products under GST would turn out to be highly beneficial for a consumer state like Kerala,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/publicly-admit-there-is-love-jihad-bjp-tells-cpm/articleshow/86303961.cms||---

It would be easier for either of the parties, tenant or owner, to exercise legal rights judiciously,” he said. Further giving respite, the rate of stamp duty has been revised to Rs 200 for a property worth Rs 10 lakh.While explaining the importance of the bill, Dhariwal said at present the Power of Attorney (POA) is optionally registrable allowing the unscrupulous elements to avoid the registration and transfer the immovable properties through the POA. “New rules say that the day power of attorney was signed, the affidavit proving the person was alive will be used then,” said Dhariwal.Replying to the concern that how Power of Attorney is grossly misused in case the signatory to the POA dies, Dhariwal says that the day POA has been signed, the signatory’s affidavit proving his alive will be submitted at the SDO. “It will prove the POA is right or wrong,” said Dhariwal.Leader of Opposition, Gulab Chand Kataria says that the amendments will not come into the force until the central government approves it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/new-amendment-likely-to-reduce-tenant-owner-row/articleshow/86306296.cms||---

While hearing a PIL filed by former chief information commissioner Shailesh Gandhi and some Right to Information activists, Bombay high court had in August directed the state to provide a roadmap to fill vacancies for posts of Information Commissioners of the State Information Commission and other top posts in a month. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-2-retd-babus-among-three-get-state-info-chief-posts/articleshow/86306272.cms||---
---||Jaipur||MBM Engg College upgraded to univ||Jaipur: BJP MLAs have called the bill for upgrading MBM Engineering College to MBM University (Multi-discipline) a misplaced priority during the debate in the assembly on Friday. However, the bill moved by the higher education minister Bhanwar Singh Bhati was passed paving the way for the 28th state varsity in the state. It has become the first university to have its first vice-chancellor for a duration of five years.Deputy leader of the opposition, Rajendra Singh Rathore expressed disbelief that since the state has several universities facing chronic problems like poor infrastructure, vacant teaching and non-teaching posts, poor quality of education makes the entry of new universities‘ undesirable.’“Like previous announcements by the CM, I don’t see this university is going to see the light of the day. It is hard to imagine that the state is forming a university with a budget of Rs 20 crore. It would have been great had they focused on improving the conditions of its existing university,” said Rathore.He said Jai Narain Vyas University exists in Jodhpur which is catering to the degree colleges in the region. “The decision of opening it in Jodhpur has more to do with the constituency of the CM Gehlot. They have undermined that in a recent UGC report stating that 30 districts in the state are educationally backwards making a strong case of providing better,” said Rathore. Bhati said universities are meant for research work and upgrading state’s first engineering college would have a positive impact on the entire state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/mbm-engg-college-upgraded-to-univ/articleshow/86306274.cms||---

OBC Mahasangh president Baban Taywade said that on September 22 they will send letters to the President, Prime Minister, home minister, social justice minister apart from Congress leaders Sonia and Rahul Gandhi. Taywade said, “All we want is justice of OBC community and right now it cannot be done in the intended manner because of multiple issues. The 27% political reservation cannot be implemented because it will ultimately breach the 50% limit.” The senior OBC leader said that the central leaders must guarantee them 27% reservation and ensure that the legal framework is in tune with the same. “The Parliament needs to go ahead with constitutional amendment so that the 50% limit issue is addressed. Also, it is important that data available with the central government regarding OBCs be shared with states so that they can also decide on the best course of action,” said Taywade. He further said that it was important for their community to press for these demands because the future scenario might be different. “For SC/ST, the political reservation has been granted based on population. So, in some districts where tribal population is high, political reservation for OBC will be less. In the future, it may not even exist,” said Taywade. Taywade on Friday resigned from the State OBC Commission, a decision he had shared with TOI on Wednesday itself.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mahasangh-to-write-to-prez-pm-top-netas/articleshow/86301506.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

---||Mumbai||Artist Chintan Upadhyay jailed since 2015 in wife’s murder case granted bail by SC||MUMBAI: In a major relief to artist Chintan Upadhyay, the Supreme Court on Friday granted him bail in the sensational 2015 double murder case of his wife Hema and her lawyer, reports Swati Deshpande. A bench noted that the trial is in progress and 12 witnesses are yet to be examined. “We are of the opinion that the petitioner is entitled to bail having been incarcerated for nearly six years,” it said in its order. The apex court said the bail amount and other conditions would be decided by the trial court, but made it clear Upadhyay cannot stay in Mumbai. The SC also directed that the trial be completed expeditiously, “preferably within six months”. Chintan gets bail over ‘delay in trial’, but can’t stay in cityGranting bail to artist Chintan Upadhyay in the 2015 double murder case, the Supreme Court on Friday directed him to surrender his passport and report to the police every month. It also made it clear he cannot stay in Mumbai, where he used to stay. “He shall reside in any place other than Mumbai and shall visit Mumbai only to attend court,” a bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and Bhushan Gavai said. Upadhyay and four others were arrested in December 2015 (see box) after the body of his artist-wife Hema and her lawyer Haresh Bhambhani were recovered in a nullah in Kandivli and has been in custody since. The state counsel opposed any relief to Upadhyay and pointed out that 29 witnesses have been examined while 12 main witnesses are remaining, but the SC agreed with the submissions of Upadhyay’s senior counsel Raja Thakare and advocates Bharat Manghani and Dilip Taur that he has been behind bars for long. In 2019, when Upadhyay had moved SC after getting no relief at the sessions and high courts, it had declined bail after the state pledged that the trial would be completed in nine months. It was not done, and Upadhyay moved the Bombay high court, which junked his bail on the grounds that there is incriminating material against him. He again knocked on the doors of the SC, and finally, on Friday got bail. Besides claiming that he deserved bail over the undue delay in trial, Upadhyay had submitted that there was “not enough material” against him and questioned the submissions made by the prosecution to try him for murder. An incriminating diary entry referred to by the prosecution didn’t exist as proved by an RTI reply, he pointed out. The police had claimed there was a diary entry where Upadhyay had referred to his enmity towards Hema.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-chintan-gets-bail-over-delay-in-trial-but-cant-stay-in-city/articleshow/86306340.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Delhi||Intel Units Meet To Thwart Terror Acts||New Delhi: Delhi Police on Friday hosted a conference of anti-terror units from states and intelligence agencies on Friday to discuss the strategy and measures to thwart extremist acts. It was for the first time that the centrally administered Delhi Police had called such a meeting. Chiefs of police forces from around 11 states and heads of agencies such as the Intelligence Bureau, National Investigation Agency, Research and Analysis Wing and Military Intelligence participated in the conference. The states and units spoke on different security-related topics, with Delhi Police briefing on the illegal weapon trafficking and the narco-terror menace, an officer said. “The meeting primarily intended to streamline the exchange of intelligence inputs and ensure better coordination among security bodies,” the officer said. The conference, held at Delhi Police Headquarters, also discussed implications of the Taliban's takeover in Afghanistan in the context of how Pakistan might exploit the situation. The Intelligence Bureau and Delhi Police's Special Cell elaborated on the recent operation of busting a terror module and recovery of RDX-based IED, grenades, arms and ammunition. Details of how this operation kicked off and its possible ramifications were discussed, officials said. The conference concluded with discussions on ensuring a smooth exchange of information, alerts and terror-related inputs to thwart misadventure by terror outfits. The intelligence agencies have been alarmed by the change in government in Afghanistan and have been keeping a close watch on the volatile situation there. There have been inputs of heightened activities on the borders since the Taliban, backed by, among others, Pakistan, overtook Afghanistan. "This coordination meeting aimed at ensuring that we were better prepared and informed of developments," said another officer. Sleuths have been continuously receiving alerts regarding terrorists attempting to cross the border to execute their plans of carrying out a ‘spectacular” attack in the country outside Jammu and Kashmir, something which they have failed to do for six-seven years. The agencies have warned of multiple India-centric plans in the making from POK-based outfits like Jaish-e-Mohammed, Lashkar-e-Tayyaba and Hizbul Mujahideen. The recent developments in which Pakistan’s ISI was found using the underworld channel aggressively in its terror plans have also left the agencies pondering and made them carry out changes in their anti-terror strategies. The focus is now relentlessly on gangsters and criminals with cross-border links.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/intel-units-meet-to-thwart-terror-acts/articleshow/86304028.cms||---

In a letter to Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman dated September 15, he also opposed bringing petrol and diesel under the GST regime. “As petrol, diesel and other petroleum products have a major contribution to the state exchequer, these products should be continued out of GST as per the existing tax structure,” said Pawar, who holds the finance portfolio. He added in the GST regime, the state’s ability to raise additional finances was limited. “However, in cooperative federalism, states require additional finances for taking up developmental activities and to accelerate the growth of the state’s economy,” his letter said. Pawar also requested GST compensation dues to states be settled and the compensation period be extended for another five years beyond June 2022. He asked for the revenue of states to be protected with an increment of 14% each year in keeping with the present arrangement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ajit-pawar-not-for-bringing-fuel-under-gst-skips-meeting/articleshow/86306381.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

He demanded to release funds to repair the city’s roads. He alleged that because of the slow work, the city has turned into a village. Devnani said that people of Ajmer district are facing the problem of bad condition of roads and that the state government is not paying any heed to the problems of the people. Ajmer cannot look like a ‘smart city’ but rather looks like a village due to this, he said. He said that the Central government had provided crores of rupees to make Ajmer into a smart city and nobody knows where this money has gone. The condition of the ‘smart city’ is that there are no proper roads in the city, there are potholes on every road, making it difficult to commute, he added. The former minister accused that the patchwork done by the district administration gets swept away in the rains and every road has potholes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ex-min-flays-govt-over-bad-roads-in-ajmer-dist/articleshow/86306341.cms||---
---||Nagpur||All schools must reopen for kids’ physical, mental well-being: Docs||Nagpur: The devastating second wave of Covid-19 pandemic has finally receded and it looks like the projected third wave will be of low intensity as compared to the first two. In view of this, calls for reopening schools are growing louder now. TOI spoke to child and adolescent psychiatrists, paediatricians and infectious disease specialists in Vidarbha and all of them have firmly said schools for all classes — right from primary and pre-primary — should be opened immediately. “Children are already mingling with each other in all parts of Maharashtra. They are playing together, travelling with families, going to malls and marketplaces etc. Then why not to school?” said Dr Vijay Dhote, president of Nagpur Academy of Paediatrics. “School setup is must for physical and mental development of kids. As members of Covid task force, we have been constantly suggesting, on both the district as well as state levels, to reopen schools. But, the final decision is to be taken by the government only,” he said. A senior member of state Covid task force told TOI that the experience of school reopening in rural Maharashtra is promising as no surge in cases has been witnessed there. “Children below 10 years are largely safe from Covid-19 infection. So, there is no risk in allowing schools to reopen at least post-Diwali,” said the member. Infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde said kids below 7 years of age are hardly infectious. “The wait to watch incidence of the disease is over now. No point in waiting for more than a few weeks from here on to reopen all schools,” he said. According to Dr Shinde, schools now must shift focus from surface cleaning to ventilation. Vaccination of all adults in the school should be compulsory and the local civic body can always conduct random testing of adult staff and symptomatic children. “Whenever possible, physical distancing should be followed in schools. We must go ahead now,” he added. Dr Pritam Chandak, consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist, said we have spent more than a year trying out various things. “We have been waiting for a golden moment like ‘zero Covid’ before reopening schools. That is not going to happen,” he said, adding there will be off and on cases and, therefore, we need a flexible response to the eventualities. “School From Home culture has significantly increased mental and behavioural issues like depression, anxiety, irritability, aggression, sleep disturbances in kids,” he said. While suggesting the road ahead, Dr Chandak said earlier schools used to operate on an annual calendar, but now we must break that up into quarterly schedules, like in many other sectors. “We should think that from now till Dussehra in October, we want our kids to have a certain school experience,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/all-schools-must-reopen-for-kids-physical-mental-well-being-docs/articleshow/86301585.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

---||Mumbai||Widows of 3 ‘manual scavengers’ to get Rs 10 lakh payout each in 4 weeks: Bombay HC||MUMBAI: In a relief for three widows of manual scavengers who died in December 2019, Bombay high court on Friday directed the district collector to pay Rs 10 lakh compensation to each within four weeks after terming the case as “eye-opening”. The workers had died in December 2019 while cleaning a septic tank at Govandi’s Morya Housing Society. A bench of Justice Ujjal Bhuyan and Justice Madhav Jamdar passed the interim order after lawyer Isha Singh argued that even though the deaths had taken place as a consequence of a housing society employing individuals as manual scavengers, the state was strictly liable and responsible for providing compensation to the families as the burden of eradicating manual scavenging in accordance with Article 17 of the Constitution (abolition of untouchability) was on the government. She buttressed her submissions by citing a Supreme Court order in Safai Karamchari Andolan versus Union of India case of 2014 and its clarification issued in 2016 that the government must provide Rs 10 lakh to the families of every person who has lost their life in sewerage work. The three women who petitioned HC were Bani Debnath, Neeta Kalshekar and Vimla Chorotiya. Government pleader Poornima Kantharia submitted that in addition to compensation, the government was further willing to rehabilitate the petitioners in accordance with Section 13 of the Prohibition of Employment of Manual Scavengers Act, 2013, by providing their children scholarships and highlighted how the petitioners would be included in the list of manual scavengers. She informed the court in accordance with its instructions, she had brought three cheques of Rs 1.25 lakh each for the petitioners. The state had said the builder of the premises deposited Rs 3.75 lakh with the government as part of compensation. The division bench directed the office of the collector to pay Rs 10 lakh to each petitioner within four weeks, with the liberty to recover the amount from the private employers. The court noted it would examine whether the government resolution regarding payment of compensation to manual scavengers is in accordance with the directions of the apex court. The detailed order will be released later. The next date is October 18.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/widows-of-3-manual-scavengers-to-get-rs-10l-payout-each-in-4-wks-bombay-hc/articleshow/86306426.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Hotels see 50% tariff spike in Diwali bookings||AHMEDABAD: With an increasing number of people getting vaccinated and Covid-19 cases continuing to remain under control, holiday bookings for Diwali have begun gaining momentum. Riding on high demand, tariffs of four-star and five-star hotels at tourist destinations have surged by a significant 50% during the Diwali holiday dates. While inquiries are good, customers are asking for flexible cancellation policy amid third wave uncertainty. “Across tourist destinations, hotel industry has taken a major hit thanks to the pandemic and restricted travel. With Diwali holidays being season time, hotels have jacked up tariff backed by an increasing demand. While travellers are willing to pay the price, they’re also seeking for flexible cancellation and refund policy due to the looming third wave threat,” said Anuj Pathak, president, Travel agents’ and tour operators’ Association of Gujarat (TAG). Across destinations such as those in Himachal Pradesh, Goa and Uttarakhand, five-star hotel tariffs which usually are priced above Rs 5,000 per room per night are now as high as Rs 8,000 to Rs 10,000 per room per night. “Overall, inquiries have shot up significantly and if the cases continue to remain under control, bookings will be good. Customers who usually take international holidays will also book domestic holidays and therefore the industry will get a good boost this time around,” said Pathak. Travel agents suggest that bookings have begun not just for domestic holiday spot but even for international destinations such as Dubai, Maldives, Mauritius and Seychelles, which have opened for tourists. Domestic destinations that are popular include North East, Goa, Himachal Pradesh, Kashmir and Leh-Ladakh. Industry players said that the uptakes for holidays to southern Indian states are relatively less this Diwali. “Being fully vaccinated, people are more confident of taking a holiday unlike last year when the Covid-19 scare still remained. As compared to last year, the uptakes are much better. Inquiries are rising by the day and people are more willing to travel as various states have done away with the requirement for travellers to mandatorily take RTPCR tests. This reduces cost of travel significantly and therefore, people are keen,” said Virendra Shah, chairman, Travel Agents’ Association of India – Gujarat Chapter. Bookings are good, and people are getting more confident as they’re vaccinated. Double vaccinated passengers don’t need to undergo RTPCR tests mandatorily due to which people are comfortably travelling as it reduces the unwanted expenditures. Overall, tour operators said that travellers have bolstered their budgets as they’re comfortable in terms of spending. “Four to Five-star properties are preferred this time and people are comfortable spending money as the revenue shortfalls faced by professionals and businessmen have improved,” said a city-based tour operator.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hotels-see-50-tariff-spike-in-diwali-bookings/articleshow/86304046.cms||Niyati Parikh

In the times when the government is running schemes like ‘beti bachao, beti padhao’, all those who are involved in such nefarious activities need a strong message that these feudal practices cannot be permitted at any cost, the court said. In 2019, a case was registered on a complaint from the ministry of health and family welfare to Delhi Police, alleging that the accused people through their company were providing services to couples who wanted male child through IVF. Additional Sessions Judge Samar Vishal stated that “despite understanding the gravity of the offence, the investigation is going on at a snail’s pace and without any seriousness.” “The FIR is of October 2019 and no substantial progress has been made,” the court said in the order. It stated that the matter be brought to the notice of the deputy commissioner of police (Crime Branch) to ensure that the investigation was expedited. The court said Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (PCPNDT) Act, 1994 was passed by the Parliament to stop female foeticide and to arrest the declining sex ratio in the country. “Those who commit such crimes are a menace to society. In a civilised society, there is no place for such crimes. So, while the investigation has been quiescent all this while for almost two years, it’s time for the investigation agency to be active now…,” it stated. The investigation officer informed the court that the accused were allegedly part of a vicious global racket. They were running an entire company for this purpose, the officer said. The accused earlier claimed that they had no role to play in the alleged crime and were fully co-operating in the investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-slams-slow-probe-into-sex-selection-complaint/articleshow/86304099.cms||Usha Das

On the question of giving camel the status of a state animal, the minister said, “Why camel has been given the status of a state animal and what are its benefits, I am not aware of it. I was not present here in 2015 when the same House passed Act and declared the camel as the state animal.” The minister was referring to the Rajasthan Camel (Prohibition of Slaughter & Regulation of Temporary Migration or Export) Act, 2015 that put restrictions on camel trade and put restrictions on the transportation of the animal both inside and outside the state while declaring camel the state animal. Amidst the discussion on the question by Amin Khan, speaker CP Joshi also intervened and asked the Minister to tell the House why the government has declared camels as the state animal and what are its advantages in comparison to other animals? In response to the Speaker, Minister gave this surprising answer. Instead of enumerating the benefits of camels as a state animal, he bluntly told the House that he had no knowledge about it. However, he assured the House that the present conditions of camels in the state are worrying and need protection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/not-aware-of-benefits-of-camel-as-state-animal-says-minister/articleshow/86306367.cms||---

Only one hotspot, Wazirpur, showed improvement, indicating much more efforts will be required on the ground to control localised air pollution. Track the pollution level in your cityIn 2018, Delhi Pollution Control Committee and Central Pollution Control Board identified Delhi’s 13 most polluted areas where PM2.5 concentration was well above even the city’s average. The survey was carried out to take location-specific action and each hotspot got a localised action plan in 2019. However, the data analysed by Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) point out only Wazirpur and Sahibabad in the entire National Capital Region (NCR) have shown actual improvements in terms of PM2.5 concentration. The data for Dwarka weren’t available for comparison. The 13 hotspots are Rohini, Dwarka, Okhla Phase II, Punjabi Bagh, Anand Vihar, Vivek Vihar, Wazirpur, Jahangirpuri, RK Puram, Bawana, Mundka, Narela and Mayapuri. Six pollution hotspots were identified for the rest of NCR — two in Faridabad and one each in Gurgaon, Bahadurgarh, Bhiwadi and Sahibabad. “Jahangirpuri with a seasonal average of 256 micrograms per cubic metre was the dirtiest among the recognised hotspots. Bahadurgarh recorded an almost 50% jump, but it was still cleaner than other hotspots,” the analysis stated. After Jahangirpuri, Vivek Vihar, Narela, Anand Vihar, Bawana were the most polluted in Delhi, all showing an increase in pollution last winter as compared to 2019-20. For the rest of NCR, Sahibabad was the most polluted with an annual average above 200 micrograms per cubic metre. CSE also pointed out that the data revealed that new pollution hotspots were also emerging, calling for equal attention. These include eight locations in Delhi and seven in the rest of NCR. These new hotspots were identified by comparing their annual average with the mean of the existing hotspots — 197 micrograms per cubic metre. The locations include Alipur, DTU, ITO, Nehru Nagar, Patparganj, Sonia Vihar, Mandir Marg and Ashok Vihar in Delhi and Sector 1 and 116 in Noida, Loni, Sanjay Vihar and Indirapuram in Ghaziabad, Knowledge Park V in Greater Noida and Bulandshahr. “This again points towards the impact of localised pollution and the data show much more efforts are required at these locations to bring them down closer to the city average,” said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director of research and advocacy at CSE who analysed the data. Working on pollution hotspots and identifying new locations is one of the 10 key focus areas identified by Delhi government as part of its winter action plan, which will be released by September-end. Constant efforts are being made every year, especially during winters, to control localised sources of pollution, said a government official. “The action plan for each hotspot include immediate as well as long-term measures. Improvement will be visible soon,” the official claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cold-discomfort-winter-pollution-worsened-in-11-of-delhi-hotspots/articleshow/86301680.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

Raju Kidoor, a teacher from the Holy Family Aided School in Kumbala, about 50 km from here, told TOI, “The NHAI has axed trees for highway expansion works from Talapady to Cherkala. On August 31, a rain tree that was around 8m high, was axed. According to our estimate, there were at least 80 nests of birds, including that of pond heron, night heron and little cormorant on the tree.” The destruction of the nests was first noticed by Ajesh, an animal lover, and a former student police cadet of Kerala. On seeing the plight of the birds, he immediately called the police department. When he received no response, he called a student police cadet officer, who asked him to call a driver from the forest department. The driver asked him to reach out to Raju Kidoor. “On reaching the spot, we were shocked. We found at least 45 birds dead. There were another 25 birds that had injuries on their wings, head, and legs. We spoke to DCF in-charge Ajith K Raman, and since the district does not have a rehabilitation centre, I took up the responsibility of looking after the birds. Unfortunately, 12 birds died. After a week, four birds were released, and currently there are nine more birds that are healthy, and are likely to be released in a week’s time. They are fed about 1.2 kg of fish every day,” Raju said. He has identified six more trees on the stretch, that the birds have nested on, and requested the NHAI site engineers to spare the trees till the birds complete nesting. “We found several nests and requested NHAI for 15 days, so that a decision on this could be taken after a review. We visited the place on Wednesday. The officials have been cooperating,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/teacher-rescues-25-birds-from-axed-rain-tree-13-survive/articleshow/86301690.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

---||Delhi||‘BJP stopped demarcation of illegal land’||New Delhi: Aam Aadmi Party MLA Somnath Bharti on Friday alleged that BJP functionaries stopped revenue department officials, including Hauz Khas SDM, from demarcating illegal occupation of government land in Hauz Khas Village on September 15. “The person who was leading the obstruction was a former MLA candidate from BJP, Shailendra Singh Monty. The property in question is a hotel that is situated in Hauz Khas Village and is built by Monty on encroached DDA land,” Bharti alleged, adding that the demarcation is pending since 2013. Monty said the allegations were baseless and he wouldl file a defamation case against Bharti. “It is the habit of AAP leaders to make baseless allegations to draw political mileage and later apologise,” Monty claimed. In a press conference, Bharti elaborated on the construction of the hotel and its ownership. “On one hand, DDA, for the past eight years, has been saying that the demarcation of this place has to be carried out but on the other, when the SDM goes to carry out the demarcation process, they intimidate her and say that this matter is sub judice and the court has already put a stay,” said Bharti.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||BJP creating rift among minorities: CPM Kerala secretariat||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The CPM state secretariat has observed that there has been a calculated attempt in the recent past to destroy the communal harmony prevailing in the state. However, it has not succeeded since the people of the state are well aware of such motives and the people behind such campaigns. Speaking after the state secretariat meeting, CPM acting secretary A Vijayaraghavan said that CPM is of the view that such attempts will be strongly resisted by rallying the people of the state against it. BJP and religious fundamentalist organisations are behind such moves. BJP is not just trying to create a split in the majority community, there is now an attempt in creating rift among the minority communities also, he added. He said that through social media and also by other means several forces had tried to destroy the peaceful atmosphere prevailing in the state. But there was no favourable response from the state for such extremism and that was the reason why all such attempts have failed here. “Any particular religion should not be blamed for the extremist activities carried out by a section of people or any fundamental groups. Such attempts will destabilize the communal harmony prevailing in the state. The CPM has always stood for the unity of the people and no such attempts to destroy the state’s secular credentials will be tolerated,” he said. Replying to queries, Vijayaraghavan said Indian Union Muslim League is going through its worst internal crisis. The anti-women policies of IUML will badly damage the party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/bjp-creating-rift-among-minorities/articleshow/86304160.cms||---
---||Agra||2 years after girl found hanging in school, Uttar Pradesh forms new SIT||AGRA: A day after Allahabad high court pulled up UP police for its shoddy investigation into the death of a 16-year-old student, who was allegedly raped and found hanging in a top government residential school in Mainpuri in 2019, the government on Friday announced a fresh Special Investigation Team (SIT) to look into the case. On Thursday, UP DGP Mukul Goel had admitted to “serious lapses in investigation” in the court. The girl, a class 11 student, was found hanging in the prayer room of her school’s hostel on September 16, 2019. The victim’s father, who works in a private company, told TOI, that the constitution of a new SIT has “revived their hopes of justice”. The new SIT has six members, a top official in the home department said. The team was formed after the high court on Thursday asked the state government and UP police for a progress report on the case within a month. The court also directed the DGP to closely monitor progress of the probe so that “it may be taken to its logical conclusions”. The court’s order, a copy of which is with TOI, said the DGP had admitted to serious lapses in the investigation and said that action has been taken against investigating officials. The DGP informed court that semen was detected on the victim’s underwear in lab tests, but the investigating officer did not send for DNA test of accused who were named in the FIR or those who were suspected within 45 days as required. The DGP told the court that three police officials have been suspended. These included additional superintendent of police Om Prakash Singh, circle officer Priyank Jain and investigating officer, Pahup Singh, who was the then Bhogaon in charge. The court also questioned why disciplinary inquiry against the then superintendent of police (SP) Ajay Shankar Rai could not be completed before his retirement. The victim’s family had approached the high court last year in August, alleging “threats from those investigating the case”. The family alleged they were not informed of the girl’s death and came to know of it when the school authorities took her body to a hospital and one of their relatives happened to spot the girl and called up the parents. According to the father, authorities tried to pass it off as suicide. “The postmortem report stated no injury other than ligature mark, however, several injury marks were visible on her body,” he said. An FIR was filed against the school principal, hostel warden and a fellow student under POCSO Act and section 376 (rape) and 302 (murder) based on the family’s complaint. The girl’s mother, a homemaker, said, “Days before her death, my daughter had said she knew some secrets of her school.” The father added, “She was very intelligent and had scored 93% in her class 10 boards. She was preparing for NEET. She could not fulfil her dream of becoming a doctor, but she should at least get justice.” The new SIT will be headed by ADG (Kanpur zone) Bhanu Bhaskar and includes IG (ATS) Lucknow G K Goswami, IG (Kanpur) Mohit Agarwal, SP (Mainpuri) A K Rai, ASP (STF) Agra unit Rajesh Yadav and CO (Kanpur Dehat) Tanu Upadhyaya.

Deputy municipal commissioner (property tax) Milind Meshram has issued instructions to assistant municipal commissioners of all 10 zones to inspect the open spaces in their respective zones. The tax department has provided assistant commissioners with a list of open plots situated in their zones. “If it is found the open plots are filthy with dumping of garbage and accumulation of stagnant water, the assistant municipal commissioners have been asked to initiate necessary action against such property owners,” the notification issued by Meshram stated. Solid waste management department’s nodal officer Gajendra Mahalle too confirmed the development and said that instructions have been issued to the 10 zonal officers of his department in the NMC. NMC has been receiving several complaints from residents about plots posing serious health hazards due to accumulation of garbage and stagnation of water for many years. TOI has been constantly highlighting this health issue. The civic body had framed bye-laws for levying fine on open plot owners if they fail to prevent people from littering their property. The assistant municipal commissioner will first issue warning to such property owners to clean their plots immediately. If they fail to clear the waste, NMC will clear the garbage and impose lifting charge of Rs50 per sq metre from such owners. Meshram said fines for not clearing garbage on open plots will be recovered from the owners by adding the amount in their property tax invoices. As per the data prepared by the tax department, maximum 36,721 open plots are situated under Ashi Nagar zone. This is followed by 26,615 properties in Nehru Nagar zone and 17,528 plots in Hanuman Nagar zone. NMC’s health department said cases of vector borne diseases are more in these zones. In the past too, the civic body had asked owners of open plots to remove garbage, bushes, trash and fence their property. But nothing has been done to enforce this.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-to-penalize-owners-of-1-35-lakh-open-plots-for-filthy-conditions/articleshow/86301717.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

The forest department’s rescue squad was immediately alerted following which the reptile was rescued and released in the surrounding forest area. “Snakes are a common sight in this region, but this was a huge one. I tried prodding it to gently get it off, but it seemed very lethargic. I decided that it was best to contact the forest department since they are experts in handling such cases, else someone else could attempt to kill it,” Rangel said. The snake reportedly exhibited docile behaviour which made it easy for the rescue squad to capture it and isolate it until it was time for its release. They estimated the age of the snake to be about three-years-old. “The snake must have eaten a rodent or a rat snake owing to which it was lethargic. Since snakes are territorial reptiles, the rescue squad said that they would release it within a kilometer’s radius of the farm,” Rangel said. Meanwhile, another king cobra was rescued on Friday morning, this one in the heart of Vasco city. The reptile was noticed in the basement of the Thakker House building on Swatantra Path. Locals immediately contacted the mobile squad from Margao who rescued the snake. The rescue operation was carried out under the guidance of Prakash Naik and the reptile was later released in the forest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/12-ft-king-cobra-rescued-from-private-farm/articleshow/86306565.cms||---

In the report, it was stated that steps are taken to provide legal aid to the convict prisoners at the prisons for filing appeals against their convictions before the high court and Supreme Court. He further stated that paralegal volunteers are appointed in the central prisons to provide effective legal aid to the prisoners to file appeal. It was further stated that they are now collecting details of the convict prisoners who have not yet filed any appeals in order to provide legal assistance to them to file appeals. During the course of hearing, the counsels raised various issues faced by those visiting the prisons. They stated there were no separate rooms to speak with the prisoners and are made to speak in the presence of the prison officials. They stated that most of the prisoners were not even aware of the procedures to file an appeal against their convictions. Taking into account the matter raised by counsels with regard to prison visits, the judges directed the advocate general to appear through video conferencing to assist the court during the next date of hearing on October 8. The court was hearing the criminal appeal filed by S Pathipoornam of Tirunelveli district in 2018 challenging the conviction and life sentence imposed by the Tirunelveli II additional sessions court on November 20, 1996. The appellant was accused of rape and murder of a woman in 1994. During the previous hearing, the legal aid counsel R Alagumani submitted that though the appellant was convicted in 1996, no assistance was extended to him to file an appeal due to which he has been in prison for 25 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-seeks-details-of-convicts-who-have-not-filed-any-appeals/articleshow/86306511.cms||Kaushik Kannan

---||Delhi||Ashram underpass mess is here to stay for 2 more months: Delhi govt||NEW DELHI: Commuters must be having an ‘oh no, not again’ feeling after the announcement on Friday that the underpass being constructed at Ashram will miss yet another deadline and not be ready before the end of November. The crossing is after all much used and the underpass work and the extension of the existing flyover there have made a mess of the busy intersection. Motorists were waiting for September 30 when the facility was to have been opened, but Delhi government now says it will take two more months to finish because of the need to move a high-voltage power line detected during construction. The shifting of the power cable will be carried out by Delhi Transco Limited in a month’s time. After that the remaining work will take another month. TOI had recently reported that an underground power line was impeding the completion of the underpass project. Public works department minister Satyendar Jain assured on Friday that the hurdle would be resolved at the earliest. “The work on the underpass is almost complete. But there is a hindrance due to the shifting of the heavy power cable near the under-construction, 16-metre-long ramp,” said the minister. “Shifting the high-voltage line will take around a month. Thereafter, the rest of the work will be finished within one month. The entire process, therefore, will need two months.” Jain added that the government was aware that the roads near Ashram Chowk were now riddled with potholes. “All these potholes will be repaired and within a couple of days, the work of surfacing of the roads will be carried out,” the minister said. Ashram Chowk links central and south Delhi with Noida and Faridabad, and the underpass will make the chowk, one of the busiest in the capital catering to around three lakh vehicles every day, signal-free and congestion-free. The below-surface section will ease the passage for vehicles coming from the direction of Jangpura and going towards Faridabad. The cross passage will be provided by the flyover connecting Lajpat Nagar, Sarai Kale Khan and DND Flyway. The foundation stone for the 750-m underpass was laid by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on December 24, 2019, with a deadline of a year. The second deadline was fixed for March 2021 and then pushed to June 2021 because of the Covid lockdown and shortage of labourers. When it couldn’t be achieved, the project got its fourth deadline of September 2021 and now a fifth two months later. There are massive jams at rush hours, though even in the non-peak hours, the roads near the junction are crowded these days. When the underpass is completed and opened for public use, a significant percentage of the traffic load will pass through the underpass, relieving the load on the surface-level intersection, thus reducing the overall congestion at the critical road junction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ashram-underpass-mess-is-here-to-stay-for-2-more-mths/articleshow/86301761.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Kolkata||Underpass plan to decongest Bypass||Kolkata: The Kolkata traffic police met the senior officials of KMDA this week to revive a three-year-old proposal to build a vehicular underpass at Metropolitan crossing. They have also asked for an elevated corridor for passenger movement from the Science City station towards Tangra. Cops have also proposed that a plot be identified on the service road (located opposite Dhapa) on the Chingrighata bound flank to set up an auto stand. A proposal has also been given to build high fences on the EM Bypass medians to stop Metro passengers from crossing over the busy road. A presentation in this regard was submitted by the Beliaghata traffic guard. On Friday, police prepared a detailed report on how the underpass will not only keep Bypass moving but also decongest the bylanes on Tangra side that is expected to cater to four times the present traffic. “The design for the underpass has been vetted by IIT Kharagpur. However, the design can shoot up costs by another Rs 75 crore. Discussions are on to thrash out a way forward,” said a senior officer at Lalbazar. Police said for now, vehicles using Metropolitan crossing will have to stick to a set traffic flow. “Until we get an alternate plan, in the form of an underpass, we have to follow a practical solution,” said an officer. In addition, a foot overbridge near Dhapa crossing, a vehicle underpass near Captain Bheri and flyover from Chingrighata crossing to Hyatt More have been proposed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/underpass-plan-to-decongest-bypass/articleshow/86304184.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Agra||Need new chambers before demolition of unauthorized ones, say Agra lawyers||AGRA : Members of the Yuva Adhivakta Sangh, an organization of young lawyers of Agra, met Manan Kumar Mishra, chairman, Bar Council of India, in Delhi on Thursday, seeking arrangement for alternative chambers before removal of ‘unauthorized’ chambers built by lawyers. A memorandum was submitted to press the demand for enhancing facilities for lawyers and arrangement of chambers in court premises. Nitin Verma, divisional president, Yuva Adhivakta Sangh, along with other members raised the issue following recent orders of registrar general, Allahabad high court, for removal of advocates’ chambers in the Civil Court of Agra, besides other districts in Uttar Pradesh. “We demanded that proper facilities be provided to lawyers and alternative chambers be given to them before initiating proceedings for removal of chambers. An order for removal of chambers without making alternative arrangements would be against the principles of natural justice,” said Verma. “The worst affected, if the order for demolition of chambers is complied with, would be the young lawyers. Thus, there is a need to reconsider the orders,” added Verma. Last week, lawyers at the Civil Court of Agra ceased routine working to protest against the order. They also stated in a meeting on Thursday that no chamber would be allowed to be demolished and a delegation of lawyers would meet the Chief Justice of Allahabad high court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/need-new-chambers-before-demolition-of-unauthorized-ones-say-agra-lawyers/articleshow/86301768.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Pune||Over 13,000 Pune Municipal Corporation school pupils without online education access||PUNE: A total of 13,642 students of the 88,359 enroled in pre-primary to Std VIII in Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) schools do not have access to online education, data shared by the PMC education department show. The civic body has said these students are given education via worksheets and voice calls, but there are 3,698 students who have completely lost contact with their teachers. Migration of parents during the pandemic is the main reason for students losing contact, they added. However, compared to the last year, there is an improvement in the number of students who are able to access online classes, PMC’s primary education officer Minakshi Raut said. “When we started last year, only 55% of students had access to online education. But now, the number has come up to 80% with access to e-learning. However, this does not mean that the remaining students are not learning. These students have basic phones on which teachers call them and tell them how to go about the lessons. We are also in the process of printing 70,000 workbooks for the students which will be distributed soon,” Raut added. Compared with the last year, teachers are also better equipped to deal with the situation now. “We have a WhatsApp group of tech-savvy teachers who make class-wise weekly test-papers, activities for the children, which are then distributed among all the teachers. Home visits are done by teachers to check the progress of students and whenever parents come to the school to take home the midday meal ration, we tell them to bring the notes in which students have written their work. Other than this many NGOs are also helping us conduct lectures in small groups where their volunteers go and teach the students every day or weekly,” Raut added. However, activists say the survey figures are far different from the ground realities. “Just because someone in the house has a phone does not mean the student is getting an online education. What happens when there is just one phone and there are three children. The father takes the phone to his work and when he comes back home, there is hardly any time left for all three children to watch educational videos or do the homework. How many teachers conduct classes at night? The actual number of students attending online classes regularly will be less than 50%,” education activist Matin Mujawar said. Former deputy mayor and sitting corporator Sidharth Dhende said PMC’s claims of conducting offline classes are a farce. “ There are hardly any teachers conducting home visits as claimed by the education department. To ensure that the poor students still have access to education, we had sought tablets for students. However, the officials are not clued in to the loss of education in children belonging to economically weaker sections of the society who mostly enrol in PMC schools. Hence, nothing came of the proposal,” Dhende said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/over-13k-pmc-school-pupils-without-online-edu-access/articleshow/86306586.cms||Ardhra Nair

The full-fledged hotel near the Thevar statue at Goripalayam junction was inaugurated by district collector S Aneesh Sekhar on Friday. The hotel is run by T Jeyachitra of Ulaganeri in Madurai, who has been in the catering business for more than a decade and has earned a reputation as a caterer for various functions along with her transgender team. The hotel in Madurai was conceptualised after the Coimbatore Trans Kitchen tasted success. Madurai Trans Kitchen has decided to keep the prices competitive considering their clientele who would be primarily kin of those admitted at the Government Rajaji Hospital. “We are not running it with a high profit motive as those who get admitted here are from the economically weaker section. We have priced chicken biriyani at Rs 100 a plate and unlimited vegetarian meals at Rs 80,” Jeyachitra said. The hotel will be serving only lunch till Sunday and will add breakfast, dinner and more items to the lunch menu from Monday. They plan to add more non-vegetarian dishes to the menu after Puratasi month. Eight transgender will work in the hotel and four will be on standby to be engaged for catering orders or to work in the absence of regular employees. Three organisations working for the marginalised sections – Swasti, Vrutti and Arghyam – have given interest free loan of Rs 6.5 lakh to Jeyachitra who needed Rs 8 lakh to open the hotel. “She will repay the loan in easy monthly instalments of her convenience,” said Priya Babu, regional programme manager of Swasti and transgender resource centre founder. The biggest challenge was finding a good space for the hotel. “We were turned down at 12 places when they approached the owners. There were instances when the owner obtained a token advance and returned the money,” Priya Babu said and added that others threw the blame on their kin. Finally, Arun, a hotelier and owner of the building near Goripalayam, rented out the space for the shop. Organisations that are providing handholding to the Trans Kitchen plan to make it a brand and take it to all the districts across the state. The third Trans Kitchen is likely to come up in Chennai, followed by the fourth in Salem.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/transsexuals-launch-hotel-at-goripalayam/articleshow/86306582.cms||---

The biopots, that are made from dough that uses groundnut shells, can emerge as an alternative to the plastic bags used in nurseries for growling saplings. T Works has designed and developed a Biopress 4T machine to scale up Srija’s idea. One Biopress 4T machine can manufacture 6,000 biopots per shift per month. The machine can also be modified to produce up to 50,000 pots per month per machine in one shift. In fact, T Works is also assisting Srija in patenting her biopot formulation. Sujai Karampuri, CEO, T Works said, “Making the biopot manually using steel glasses as moulds has inherent drawbacks. The shape, size, weight, and structural properties change beyond allowable limits from one piece to another. To overcome this, T Works helped Srija conduct research and experiments to identify the right ratios of ingredients for the dough and optimal shape for pots.” Shanta Thoutam, chief innovation officer, Telangana, said the state government will use its flagship programme, Haritha Haram’ and other channels to roll the product into market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/t-works-mass-produces-biodegradable-pots-developed-by-gadwal-student/articleshow/86304215.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Peacock palace, gallery on defence forces on show at Ganesh pandals||Mumbai: As the festival of Ganeshotsav comes to a peak, big and small pandals in the city are drawing attention for their themes that are a blend of grandeur and social welfare. In Kalachowkie, the 65-year-old mandal of Abhyudaya Nagar Cha Raja has unveiled an eye-catching Mayur Mahal crafted from fibreglass and plaster of Paris (PoP). The mandal has won so many prizes that its idol is nicknamed ‘Paritoshikancha Raja’ or king of prizes. Organiser Akash Nerale said, “This year we donated rations to 100 flood-affected families in Mahad.” Another prize-winning mandal of Anjirwadi, Mazgaon, known for its ostentatious sets, has installed a 4ft-tall idol near its Ganesh temple. In Dadar (E), the compound of Radhakrishna Niwas society has transformed into a hall of tribute to the Army, Navy and Air Force. Organiser Abhay Chavan said, “We wanted to pay respects to our country’s defence forces in this 75th year of Independence. Artist Jollie Mamen has made silhouette paintings on the wall to depict all three forces, and Hrushikesh Banawalkar has created the Indian flag using cup art.” Its idol sits against a backdrop of the Indian flag whose three colours are made from scores of cups coloured orange, white and green. At least two mandals have used tissue paper and alum to craft their idols. In J B Nagar, Andheri (E), the third generation youth of Riddhi Siddhi Mandal have crafted an imposing idol from these elements bonded with “ghati gum”, the colloquial term for natural resin. Organisers Kiran Patel and Dinesh Chindarkar said, “Such idols take approximately two months to create because it needs time for drying and finishing. And it is difficult to make in the monsoon. But we insisted on doing so because it is time we wake up to the reality of conserving our environment.” The Vile Parlecha Peshwa mandal in Vile Parle (E) has been using tissue paper for years. This year its Ganesha idol resembles Vishnu reclining on Sheshnag, much like the Lalbaugcha Raja. “Our idol is made of alum and tissue paper, and will be immersed in an artificial pond on Hanuman Road,” said organiser Vijay Naikude.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-peacock-palace-gallery-on-defence-forces-on-show-at-ganesh-pandals/articleshow/86306574.cms||Bella Jaisinghani

---||Pune||Thanu Padmanabhan devoted career to fathom gravity||PUNE: Renowned theoretical physicist Thanu Padmanabhan, a distinguished professor at the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), known for his research in gravitation and quantum gravity, died of cardiac arrest on Friday in Pune. He was 64. He is survived by wife, Vasanthi Padmanabhan, an astrophysicist, and daughter Hamsa Padmanabhan, currently a researcher at the University of Geneva in Switzerland. Top scientists, researchers and politicians offered condolences and paid rich tribute. A statement issued by IUCAA said he was a distinguished professor and had devoted his career to understand gravity. “Paddy, as he was popularly known in the community, leaves behind hundreds of papers on cosmology, quantum and classical gravity, and many other branches of physics, and is one of the most-cited authors in physical sciences in India,.” the statement added. Padmanabhan was also involved in policy making and administration of the International Astronomical Union and was the President of Commission 47 on cosmology. He was the chairman, commission 19 (astrophysics) of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics. K Vijayraghavan, principal scientific adviser to the government of India, said, Padmanabhan’s research linking general relativity and thermodynamics in new ways, and in other areas, has been widely recognized. “ He was a scholar, communicator, extraordinary scientist, and friend to many. He will be much missed,” he added. Other eminent scientists recounted their interactions with Padmanabhan. NCRA director Yashwant Gupta said he found Padmanabhan inspiring. “He was a brilliant theoretical physicist at the core, he had a good connect with experimental astronomers like me. We had the benefit of his sharp acumen and strong organisational abilities when he was in the chair at the GMRT Time Allocation Committee from 2006 to 2009. He streamlined the operations and gave it good direction. He was a great scientist and a remarkable personality,” Gupta said. Tarun Souradeep, professor and chair (physics) at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune, recalled his long association with Padmanabhan since 1989. He knew him as a neighbour and colleague at IUCAA for 17 years till 2019. “It is a great loss for Indian science. His knowledge covered many aspects of theoretical physics. He is internationally recognised for his research and his books. He also leaves behind a rich legacy of students who are good researchers in India,” Souradeep added. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said Padmanabhan was instrumental in developing an interest in science among students. “He has given a new image to India through his scientific contributions. He has also paved the way for young and aspiring researchers in the right direction. It’s a great loss to the scientific community in India,” the deputy CM added. Mayor Murlidhar Mohol said his research work over four decades has been immense and proved to be a great guide for students. “His work is a treasure for several generations,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/t-padmanabhan-devoted-career-to-fathom-gravity/articleshow/86306556.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

Initially, 50 BJP corporators had travelled to Daman five days ago. But the party’s mayoral candidate, Pradeep Karpe, and the incumbent mayor, Chankrakant Sonar, returned to Dhule city on Thursday. The BJP’s move to shift its corporators to a “safe place” before the polls was an effort to pre-empt any move by the opposition to get some of them to defect, a source privy to the arrangement said. The BJP leadership had faced reverses in the mayoral polls in the Sangli and Jalgaon civic bodies earlier this year due to cross-voting. The BJP had won the Dhule municipal polls in December 2018, defeating the NCP for the first time in the 73-member civic body. The mayoral poll returning officer and Dhule district collector, Jalaj Sharmed, on Friday said the BJP candidate, Karpe, bagged 50 votes and won the election. The Congress and the AIMIM had also fielded candidates for the poll. Dhule district BJP president Anup Agarwal confirmed to TOI that most of the party corporators exercised their franchise online from a hotel in Daman. He, however, denied that the elected representatives were shifted to prevent any cross-voting in the mayoral polls, like it had happened in Sangli and Jalgaon. “These corporators had requested for a short trip after a long period of travel curbs due to the Covid pandemic. Accordingly, we decided to spend a few days in Daman,” said Agarwal, who accompanied the corporators to Daman. A section of the BJP insiders, however, said the party did not want to take any chances, given the Sangli and Jalgaon episodes where the party was in power but lost the mayoral polls because of cross-voting by some corporators. In the Jalgaon mayoral poll, the Shiv Sena had managed to woo 27 BJP corporators. They had voted against the BJP nominee. A senior NCP leader of Dhule claimed that some BJP corporators were in touch with him before the mayoral poll. “The opposition needed the support of 14 BJP corporators to win the mayoral poll. But we desisted from wooing some of the BJP corporators due to various reasons,” the leader said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/dhule-bjp-corporators-vote-for-new-mayor-from-daman-hotel/articleshow/86299661.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

---||Pune||Careless options keep FYJC aspirants on hold||Pune: Carelessness in filling option forms has led to non-allotment of colleges to students even after the third round of admissions for the first year junior college in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad. Only 9,261 students were allotted colleges though 29,505 applications were received for the 56,635 seats were available in First Year Junior Colleges across Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad for the third round. Data of previous two rounds show that while there are many applications, allotments are very less. Meena Shendkar, assistant director of education Pune division, said, “The students get allotted colleges as per the 10 choices they have filled in their option form. However, if there are no vacancies in these colleges or if the cut- off marks are very high, then there is very little chance that a student will be allotted any college. The software only checks the feasibility of allotment in the options filled by the student. It does not give alternative allotments even if there are vacancies in other colleges, if the student has not chosen that college as one of his or her options.” Rajendra Zunjarrao, principal of Modern College of Arts Science and Commerce, said the students sometimes also make the mistake of not checking whether they have applied for grantable or non-grantable divisions. “Cut-off marks and vacancies of grantable and non-grantable divisions within a college will also be different. Hence, the students need to check cut-off marks and vacancies in the division they want to apply for. Then they need to check what percentage of marks they have obtained in Std XII. If the marks in a college have not come down considerably in the previous rounds, and the number of vacancies is also less, chances are it will go down just by the same percentage in the next round too,” said Zunjarrao.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/careless-options-keep-fyjc-aspirants-on-hold/articleshow/86306596.cms||---

Water minister and Delhi Jal Board (DJB) chairman Satyendar Jain on Friday visited the construction site of the project that is expected to be completed by 2022-end. Once completed, the STP will be able to help trap a large chunk of sewage currently flowing into Yamuna and can treat sewage to biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and total suspended solids (TSS) levels of 10 mg/l each, with nutrient removal, officials said. Jain said the STP was being built over an area of 110 acres using state-of-the art technology. “The Kejriwal government is constructing the largest single STP in India. The capacity of this STP is 564 MLD and this means, after its construction, it will be able to stop 564 MLD of sewage from flowing into Yamuna,” said Jain. “We are working with our full dedication and compensating for the delay due to Covid-19 by putting in additional resources. The work of this STP is expected to be completed by December 2022,” he added. The STP will be receiving sewage largely from south and central Delhi and the plant will also have a solar drying system for around 150 ton of sludge spread over 12 acres. Advanced suction-based clarifiers are being used to improve the removal of solid particles from the wastewater. “The treated water from this STP will be utilised for various purposes, such as in the groundwater recharge at Asola Bhatti Mines and its surrounding areas, rejuvenating lakes, waterbodies and the surplus water will be released into Yamuna,” a DJB official said. In addition to this, two existing STPs of 72 MLD and 136 MLD will continue to function in the Okhla STP complex. This will take the total treatment capacity of the Okhla STP complex to 771 MLD.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/jain-indias-biggest-sewage-plant-to-be-ready-by-2022-end/articleshow/86304297.cms||---

---||Delhi||Construction sites put on notice over dust norms||New Delhi: Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai on Friday directed all private construction agencies to follow 14-point guidelines to prevent dust pollution. He asked them to comply with the norms within 15 days. After a meeting with private construction agencies, the minister said, “The Kejriwal government is working with full force to tackle the problem of pollution in Delhi. Instructions have been given to the agencies to conduct review meetings individually. They have to comply with the guidelines within 15 days. After that, the government will take action and start proceedings in accordance with the winter action plan.” He said all private agencies should appoint an employee at their construction sites to see whether the norms were being followed or not. Rai said pollution was an issue related to our lives and that of our children. “We all have to fight for our breath together. Therefore, all of us will have to fulfil our responsibility with full sincerity. Everyone has to make changes in their daily behaviour,” he said. During the meeting, suggestions were also taken from representatives of the private construction agencies. Some of the guidelines issued to construction sites to prevent dust pollution are installation of dust or wind breaking walls around the periphery of the construction site and anti-smog guns at large construction sites. Tarpaulin or green net should be used around the area under construction. All vehicles carrying construction material and construction debris should be fully covered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/construction-sites-put-on-notice-over-dust-norms/articleshow/86301824.cms||---

Participating in the Madurai Smart City Advisory Forum meeting here on Friday, he said this was a blooper in the programme. DTCP is to districts what Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) is to Chennai. Multi-storey buildings have to be approved by DTCP, and if they find anomalies or deficiencies they have to be rectified to proceed with the construction. As far as Periyar bus stand was concerned, officials said DTCP had raised some queries, but there had been lack of coordination due to the Covid lockdown. Since it is a government project, the tenders were called and funding initiated without waiting for final approvals. Finance minister P T R Palanivel Thiagarajan, who also attended the second meeting of the forum, said they were contemplating ways to re-engineer some of the works as 14 of them were 80% complete. Some of them had to be reorganised so as to bring the works to utilisation. The two parking lots of Meenakshi Amman temple and Periyar bus stand are meant to jointly hold over 500 cars and 6,000 two-wheelers, which would only add to the congested traffic in the area. These parking lots did not have adequate ramps to manage the specified number of vehicles and could lead to huge queues forming on the roads. “They actually would have had to be demolished and reorganised, but now we are thinking of putting the existing structures to best use,” the minister said. Due to the absence of an elected local body council, the state government had not been able to receive Rs 2,875 crore from the Union government, because the corporation elections had not been held in the state for the past five years. How the Union government sanctioned nearly Rs 1,000 crore for smart city programme when there was no elected council is a big question, he said. On former minister Sellur K Raju’s denial of charges of largescale corruption in the smart city programme implemented so far, the finance minister said he should be careful with his words as proving the charges against them was not a big deal. The meeting was also attended by local body representatives and officials including corporation commissioner Dr K P Karthikeyan and district collector Dr S Aneesh Sekhar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/periyar-bus-stand-renovation-work-began-without-dtcp-nod-says-mp/articleshow/86306599.cms||---

President of Anna Nagar Shenbaga Thottam Residents Welfare Association, V Sankaralingam says the park was taken up for rejuvenation under Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (Amrut) during 2016-2017 at a cost of Rs 52 lakh. Thirupathy, a resident of Anna Nagar, says when it got a facelift in 2019 it was the most beautiful park around. “It was a pleasure to walk and make children play there, but now, as it was not maintained properly, the equipment have got badly damaged and children are not able to play there,’’ he said. Sankaralingam said the contractor had done a bad job in the installation of the equipment. For instance, the legs of the swing were fixed with just sand piles around them. As children started playing regularly, it collapsed. People say since the equipment got damaged, some people have started entering the park after it shut at 8 pm and were misusing it. The borewell dug up in the park when has run dry resulting in water scarcity. Corporation assistant engineer S Babu said the park was being given special attention and water tankers were being used to bring water. The damage to the grill on the compound had also been rectified and the play equipment would be repaired at the earliest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/park-built-under-amrut-poorly-maintained/articleshow/86306626.cms||---

All temples in Kerala are closed and while this temple’s monthly expenses are Rs 1.25 crore, “we are able to hardly get Rs 60-70 lakh rupees. Therefore, we have sought certain directions”, senior advocate R Basant, appearing for the committee, told a bench headed by Justice U U Lalit. Basant said the trust is trying to avoid its obligation by not making their record available for audit. The trust has Rs 2.87 crore in cash and Rs 1.95 crore in assets as per the 2013 audit report, he said. The trust is constituted as per court’s order and it must contribute to the temple, Basant told the bench, also comprising Justices S Ravindra Bhat and Bela M Trivedi. Senior advocate Arvind Datar, representing the trust, argued that it is a public trust made by the royal family and has no role in administration. “The trust was constituted only to oversee the pujas and rituals of the temple involving the family... It came into picture before the Supreme Court only after the amicus curiae demanded that the accounts of the trust also should be audited,” he said, adding that it need not be audited as it is separate from the temple. “We don’t want the administrative committee to have a supervisory role over our trust. We will perform our job as a trust and if we don’t perform, we will lose our benefits under law…,” Datar said. The top court then reserved its order on the application filed by the Sree Padmanabha Swamy Temple Trust to exclude it from the audit of 25 years ordered by the court last year. agencies||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/temple-in-financial-stress-offerings-insufficient-sc-told/articleshow/86304262.cms||---

Taking a cue from Modi’s 2018 speech when he had suggested that the jobless youth should sell “pakoras”, NSUI members set up a stall outside Agra’s Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar University and sold the spiced fritters. Youth Congress members hung their marksheets and degree certificates on the chest and sold pakoras from a push cart at Sadhan village in Achnera block. Deepak Sharma, district president of the Youth Congress, said, “During 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the PM had promised two crore jobs in five years. The promise has not been fulfilled. The government has betrayed youths. The PM hardly talks about the students and their issues.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/nsui-youth-congress-sell-pakoras-to-mark-pms-birthday-as-national-unemployment-day/articleshow/86301841.cms||---

An officer from the Pimpri police said, “Around 5am, Nagnath Lobhe was crossing the road, when a speeding vehicle hit him,” the officer said. “We have booked an unknown driver for rash driving,” the officer said. In another accident, 35-year-old man sustained severe injuries after being hit by a Shivshahi bus near Chandni Chowk on the Katraj-Dehu Road bypass. The accident occurred around 12.30pm, when Sandip Chavan was crossing the road. “There was traffic congestion near Chandni chowk due to the ongoing flyover work. All of a sudden, the man came in front of the bus and fell under the wheels,” the bus driver told TOI.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: A day after murder, brothers took loan with looted gold||KOLKATA: A day after brothers Sanjay Kumar Das (44) and Sandip Kumar Das (32) murdered their cousin, Susmita Mondal (43) and her son Tamojit Mondal (13) at their Behala home on September 6, they visited a non-banking financial firm and took a loan of Rs 46,500 in exchange for a portion of the gold they had looted from the Mondals’ home. This was barely hours after the two brothers visited Susmita’s home and told her husband, Tapan, they were confident the motive of the murder was robbery. They told Tapan the killers would be caught. Susmita Mondal (43) and her son Tamojit Mondal (13)Police said the accused took the gold loan for two reasons: First, they wanted to earn quick money and second, they thought this was the best way to dispose of the loot without raising suspicion. On Friday, a portion of the deposited gold ornaments was retrieved from the firm’s Batanagar office, where the two had gone to seek the loan. “This will be our biggest evidence against the two brothers. We are trying to get footage of them visiting the office on September 7,” said an officer. “Following interrogation of Sanjay, a broken gold chain, a bangle cover, a pair of ear drops and a pair of ear studs, all weighing 15.4gm, were retrieved. Gold loan documents from the Batanagar branch were also seized,” said joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma. Police said they were finding out how much gold was looted. “Paper verification is on. Sanjay claimed he took a loan of Rs 30,000 but the papers show it was Rs 46,500,” a homicide section officer said. Police are yet to learn why Sandip agreed to be part of the crime, especially since Sanjay apparently told him about his plot four days before they committed the murders. “Sandip ran the family expenses and he had thought if he could get hold of the gold, he would be relieved of his financial burden. We are finding out if the two brothers together invested in the gold loan or whether Sandip was given a separate share,” Sharma said on Friday. Sanjay had expected to find more valuables at Susmita’s place. “Sanjay had asked Susmita for a Rs 5,000 loan, which she promised him to give but she told his mother about it. This had upset Sanjay,” an officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/a-day-after-murder-brothers-took-loan-with-looted-gold/articleshow/86304265.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The civic officials, who were busy in making arrangements for the arrival of secretary of Union ministry of housing and urban authority Durga Shanker Mishra, blamed heavy rainfall for the situation and claimed the water was drained out in a few hours after the showers stopped. The waterlogging was witnessed at Chandigarh Road, Hambran Road, Tibba Road, Ferozepur Road, Haibowal, BRS Nagar, Chander Nagar, Dugri, Transport Nagar and Samrala Chowk. Even Buddha Nullah’s water level had increased. The officials had directed the field staff to clear the water from the areas the secretary was expected to visit. Dr Amandeep Bains, a resident of Dugri, said, “The Dugri Road is completely broken and when it rains, the potholes create a nightmare for the commuters. Even at the Old GT Road there was waterlogging. The authorities have been claiming to make the city smart, but they did not take any steps to resolve the waterlogging issue. They are hardly bothered about our woes.” A resident from BRS Nagar, Kapil Arora, said, “The main BRS Nagar Road was submerged and it was quite difficult to pass through it. The cars splashed water on other vehicles and people. The authorities were busy in welcoming the secretary and ignored the residents' problems.” Commuters faced a traffic mess after the rain stopped around 10.30am, leading to long queues of vehicles at main roads, which were submerged. Superintending engineer of operation and maintenance cell Rajinder Singh said, “The field staff was deputed on the task to drain out water and in almost two hours after rain stopped, the work was done. The high intensity of rain caused waterlogging.” MC Zone C office turns island The MC Zone C office looked like an island on Friday when it was surrounded by rainwater. The visitors to the office and the employees were a harried lot as they had to cross a waterlogged area for entering the office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/mc-officials-busy-welcoming-union-secy-as-city-roads-drown/articleshow/86301870.cms||---
---||Pune||Citizens indulge in modified versions of modak and sweets||Pune: The traditional steamed ukdicha modak, which is a favourite of Lord Ganesh, has taken many avatars this festive season, as health conscious people look for alternatives to give it a twist with some innovative fillings. Some have modified the recipe by doing away with sugar and introducing flaxseeds and poppy seeds to ramp up the nutritional value and trying out savoury fillings as a festive snack as well. Megha Agarwal, a baker from Wakad, said that her baked ragi modak and puran poli handpies were in demand among those who wanted to gift healthy items to their loved ones. “Nobody gifts puran polis, but in the form of handpies it becomes a unique item to gift while visiting homes of friends and family during the festival.” Karishma Poonekar, the owner and head chef at a unit selling delicacies in Koregaon Park that offers diabetic-friendly foods, has come out with modaks with a low glycemic index. “In our preparations, we replace refined flour with almond flour and use a pomegranate-based sweetener. We also make low-carb dark chocolate modaks.” Abhinay Dal experimented with a savoury twist, creating a modak-samosa assemblage. “We had leftover rice flour dough after preparing the traditional ukidiche modak. We stuffed it with a potato and peas filling to combine to concept of a samosa and modak. My family loved this as a snack,” he said. Those who don’t mind indulging in decadent varieties of sweets look for new and innovative flavours. “This year, we introduced paan-flavoured modaks. Made with tutti-frutti coconut and gulkand, sans the supari, it has contributed to 40% of our sales. The rasmalai modak is also another popular flavour,” said Rutuja Gaikwad, a home chef from Balajinagar. Anurima Athalye, a caterer from Bavdhan, said, “We had many guests over during the first five days of the festival and they loved the crunchy varieties I made with butterscotch and toasted oats. Though we made traditional ukadiche modak, we also wanted to do something fun for the kids, so I prepared a ‘Bounty’ themed version based on my son’s favourite chocolate bar.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/citizens-indulge-in-modified-versions-of-modak-and-sweets/articleshow/86306638.cms||Anjali Jhangiani
---||Aurangabad||Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray refers to BJP ministers as ‘future colleagues’||AURANGABAD: Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday fuelled speculation over possible ties with the BJP in the future after he addressed dignitaries on the dais at a function in Aurangabad as “my former, current and, if we come together, my future colleagues”. BJP leader and MoS for railways Raosaheb Danve, Union MoS for finance Bhagwat Karad, Congress minister Balasaheb Thorat and Shiv Sena ministers Subhash Desai, Abdul Sattar and Sandipanrao Bhumre were present on the stage. The Thackeray-led Sena had parted ways with the BJP after the 2019 assembly polls and formed a government with the NCP and Congress. Later, during a media interaction, Thackeray sought to clarify his statement. “The nature of politics has become ‘vikrut’ (deformed). I wanted to say that politics should be done without any ego about the position,” he said. Thackeray’s support for Danve’s proposal of a bullet train connecting Mumbai and Nagpur as well as his act of sending wishes to PM Narendra Modi publicly added to the speculation. Thackeray said the Maharashtra government will extend full support to the Mumbai-Nagpur bullet train project. Danve told the media, “If the two parties come together once again, the voters from Maharashtra will be happy.” Reacting to Thackeray’s remarks, former CM Devendra Fadnavis told reporters, “He must have expressed his thoughts after realising what kind of people he is working with.... everything is possible in politics, but the state BJP is not eyeing power. We are an efficient opposition party and will continue our work.” Later, even Sena minister Sattar said that if there is a consensus in continuing Thackeray as the state’s chief minister for the next three years, then the two saffron parties can definitely come together in the coming days. However, Sena leader Sanjay Raut sought to downplay Thackeray’s comments, saying Danve was everybody’s friend. “When he was state BJP chief, all was well. There is nothing earth-shaking in the comment.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/uddhavs-statement-hints-at-future-alliance-with-bjp/articleshow/86299708.cms||Mohammed Akhef

---||Dehradun||Char Dham yatra begins today, Uttarakhand govt issues SOP||DEHRADUN: Soon after the nod from the high court on Thursday, the Uttarakhand government on Friday evening issued the standard operating procedure (SOP) for the Char Dham yatra, paving the way for the commencement of the pilgrimage to the Himalayan shrines of Gangotri, Yamunotri, Badrinath and Kedarnath from Saturday morning. For devotees coming to Uttarakhand 15 days after receiving a double dose of vaccination, the vaccination certificate has been made mandatory. In case a pilgrim has not been administered the first or the second dose, a RT-PCR negative report (within 72 hours of arrival) would be required for the visit to the four revered shrines. However, for the states of Kerala, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh – where there has been an increase in the number of Covid cases in the last few weeks, only those devotees who have completed 15 days after double dose vaccination and also have a RT-PCR negative report, would be permitted. Chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami told TOI, “Char Dham yatra forms the financial backbone of many families who are dependent on the annual pilgrimage. We will ensure that everyone follows the Covid protocols and directives given by the high court.” According to the HC directives, a daily limit of 1,000 pilgrims has been fixed for Badrinath, 800 for Kedarnath, 600 for Gangotri and 400 for Yamunotri. While three devotees have been allowed in the sanctum sanctorum of Badrinath, Gangotri and Yamunotri at a given time, five pilgrims have been allowed at Kedarnath as it has a larger area in the sanctum sanctorum compared to the other temples. As per the SOP, a six feet distance would be required to be maintained among all the devotees standing in queue or entering or leaving the temple. All pilgrims would be required to register themselves at the Smart City portal and thereafter take an e-pass for the pilgrimage. The e-pass would be valid for a period of two days. According to the SOP, bath in the “kunds”(hot water enclosures) near the temples is not permissible and pilgrims cannot stay more than a single night at a dham. For ensuring compliance to guidelines, a state-level monitoring cell would be set up in Dehradun. Monitoring cells would also be set up in districts housing the four shrines. All the data related to the pilgrims would be compiled at the district level.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/sop-issued-char-dham-yatra-begins-today/articleshow/86301877.cms||Kautilya Singh

According to the health department officials, water-logging caused by the rainfall will result in mosquito breeding and foil efforts to maintain hygiene and sanitation. Following orders of the state government, excavators, suction machines and municipal staffers have been sent to Firozabad, the worst hit by dengue outbreak. According to the meteorological department, it will continue to rain in Agra for the next three days. A K Singh, additional director, health, said, “Water-logging caused by rainfall is a setback for efforts being made to control the spread of dengue and other vector-borne diseases in Firozabad and adjoining districts. An alert has been issued to local authorities to ensure proper sanitation and hygiene and prevent stagnation of water. A fresh drive for anti-larvae spraying will be launched in the affected areas. The number of beds in government health centres is also being increased.” With five more deaths reported in the last 24 hours, the toll in Firozabad reached 135. Out of these, 102 were children. According to TOI sources, 36 critical patients were under treatment at the 18-bed capacity emergency ward of the medical college. Besides, 600 other patients were undergoing treatment at designated wards for patients with dengue symptoms. Out of these, two-thirds were children. “There are 64 active camps in the district, with 4,500 people undergoing treatment,” said Dinesh Kumar Premi, CMO. Sources also told TOI that at least 12,000 people in the district are estimated to be bedridden with fever, at home or in private hospitals. Sick people can be seen lying on cots in rural areas. Last week, ICMR reported an outbreak of DENV-2 serotype of dengue in Firozabad. Blaming the lack of sanitation and hygiene for its spread, health officials said dengue hemorrhagic fever is the major cause of fatality among children. So far, over 600 cases of dengue have been confirmed in Firozabad district. A few cases of malaria, scrub typhus (a bacterial illness spread by larval mites) and leptospirosis (a bacterial disease spread through the urine of infected animals) have also been reported.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/rainfall-increases-trouble-for-dengue-hit-west-up-health-dept-sounds-alert/articleshow/86301867.cms||---

Solanki’s family was counselled by doctors after which they agreed to donate his organs. The doctors could retrieve his heart, kidneys, liver and pancreas, which gave a new lease of life to five persons in different hospitals of the city. For Civil Hospital, it was the first harvesting of heart from a brain-dead patient. Dr Rakesh Joshi, medical superintendent of Civil Hospital, said that the heart was sent to a private hospital near SG Road on Thursday. “For the purpose, a special green corridor was created by city police due to which the heart traversed 12km in just 11 minutes. It’s both availability of the patient and experts that made the heart retrieval a success. Due to sustained efforts by staff and doctors, we have been able to get 35 organ donations from 11 patient in the past nine months. Out of total, eight of the donations took place in the past nine days,” he said. A 36-year-old patient from Morbi got the donated heart. The doctors said that the patient would not have survived for long as valves of his heart were malfunctioning. A pacemaker was also installed in 2017 but his heart function had not improved beyond 10-20%. He got the heart after five hours of surgery. Dr Pranjal Modi, vice-chancellor of ITS and convenor of SOTTO, said that Solanki’s kidney and pancreas were transplanted in a 35-year-old man from Surat, another kidney in a 65-year-old patient from Ahmedabad, and liver in a 40-year-old woman from Ahmedabad. “Increase in awareness would surely reduce our dependency on live donation in organs such as kidneys,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/civil-retrieves-heart-from-brain-dead-man/articleshow/86304294.cms||---

Narrating the story about the history of the idol at Shri Sharda Gajanan Temple, Anna Thorat, president, Akhil Mandai Mandal, said, “Laxmanrao, alias Dongre Nathuram Kachi, the founder of our mandal, went to Bhavani Mata mandir in Solapur to pray for a son and vowed that he would install an identical idol in Pune when his prayers were answered. In 1893, he was blessed with a son, and the idol was installed at the temple the following year.” He said the idol is eco-friendly, made with paper, cloth and natural adhesives, a century before it became a trend. “The idol has stood the test of time even though it has been put on display every year since the Ganeshotsav was started as a public event.” Speaking about their 128 year-old idol made of Shami tree wood, Kedar Dakhave, president, Twashta Kasar Samaj Sanstha, said, “The idol was installed by Lokmanya Tilak, who started public Ganeshotsav to bring people together. After keeping the idol on display during Ganeshotsav, we take it back to our library building in Kasba Peth.” The idol in Akra Maruti Chowk Ganesh Mandir, also called Pratham Dagdusheth Ganapati in Shukrawar Peth, was also installed by Lokmanya Tilak along with Dadguseth Halwai after whom the temple is named. Pratik Shejval, member of Akra-Maruti Chowk Ganeshotsav Mandal, said, “This is the first idol installed in 1893 made of paper mache.” He added that another idol was installed at the Shreemant Dagdusheth Halwai Ganapati Mandir located on Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Road under the leadership of Tatyasaheb Godse in 1952.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/100-year-old-idols-look-new-stand-test-of-time/articleshow/86306701.cms||Mandar Deshpande

---||Kolkata||Students of 3,000 CBSE schools in West Bengal to appear for learning test||KOLKATA: The Covid pandemic and the resultant paradigm shift in the education system have heavily impacted learning among school children, feels the Central Board of Secondary Education. To get an idea of how much the prolonged shutdown of campuses has had an effect on students and their learning process, the board will conduct a National Achievement Survey (NAS) on behalf of the ministry of education in November. The survey will be in the form of tests to be conducted for children in classes III, V, VIII and X, that will assess their learning gaps and where. The survey will be held in select schools in each state, including 3,165 CBSE institutes in Bengal. In schools that will be selected for the survey, tests will be conducted on language, mathematics, EVS/science and social sciences. The schools selected in each state will be a mix of government, aided and unaided private institutes. The exercise will cover 1.24 lakh schools across 733 districts in the country. For In classes III and V, the test will be on language, maths and EVS, Class VIII children will be assessed on language, maths, science and social science, while students in Class X will be additionally tested in English. The mode of the test will be oral for junior classes and written for classes VIII and X. A circular from the board has reached city school heads, though they are yet to know the names of the institutes that have been selected for the assessment. The document that the CBSE has drawn up on NAS says, “It will help in systematic understanding of the consequences that prolonged closure of schools have had on students’ learning in terms of their socio-emotional and cognitive development.” “We have received the circular and the details but are yet to know whether we have been selected for the survey or not. It is indeed a good move because kids have been silently impacted by Covid and we need to think of new ways of identifying the gaps and addressing them before it is too late,” said Meena Kak, director of Lakshmipat Singhania Academy. City schools agreed that such an assessment was required because despite best efforts, through online lessons, teachers had not been able to reach out to every child and that some of them had developed serious lag. Heads of some schools felt online classes had outlived their utility and that classes on the virtual mode were stressing both kids and teachers alike, negatively impacting education. The board is appointing coordinators who will, in turn, appoint school-wise coordinators for the survey. “School principals and vice-principals of selected schools will be the key persons we will be coordinating with. The exams will be centrally conducted but we will soon get further clarity,” said Vijaylakshmi Kumar, principal of Asian International School, who has been appointed as one of the coordinators by the board for NAS. Loveleen Saigal, principal of Birla High School, said the board would get a snapshot of what students had learnt and would by the end of their respective academic years. “It needs to be quantified if learning objectives and outcome match because we have all gone through a difficult time. Since the exam will be for the entire class, it will be easy for the board to find out the percentage of a representative classroom has been able to cope with. It will also help devise future learning formula,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/students-of-3k-cbse-schools-in-state-to-appear-for-learning-test/articleshow/86304301.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

Vishalgad, a fort in Shahuwadi tehsil of Kolhapur district, is also called ‘Khelna’ by the locals. The fort is known for the battle between the Maratha sardar Baji Prabhu and Siddi Masud of Bijapur Sultanate, while King Shivaji reached the fort safely passing through steep slopes and dense forest. The fort covers an area of 1,130m and is located at a height of 3,500 feet above sea level. Collector has asked the Shahuwadi tehsildar to re-survey the fort area and ask people to remove encroachments on their own before the administration takes action. Several groups have demanded removal of the encroachments over the historical fort. Owing to this, the district collector held a video conference meeting on Thursday evening with the archaeological department, tehsildar of Shahuwadi and Panhala taluka, members of the Vishalgad anti-encroachment committee, and forest department officials. Rekhawar said, “The archaeological department should study legal procedure and send 30-days notice to the people who have done encroachments over the fort. The tehsildar concerned has been asked to carry out re-survey of the fort premises and hold meetings with people so that they take down the encroachments on their own.” He added that the local authorities will check if there are any alternative places where these people can be rehabilitated.

Inspector Sandip Gurme said the deceased, Santosh Waghmare, worked as workman with a private company in MIDC Waluj area. “He had left home on September 9 on the pretext of going to work. But he neither he reached his workplace, nor did he return home,” he said. “As per complaint lodged Waghmare’s wife, the accused had been bothering her for a while and forcing to get back into a relationship.

The state government had earlier this year given in-principle nod to these seven universities to get the CoE status. “Among other benefits, these universities would have to fill all their seats – as many as 4,000 of them put together as the role of ACPC in the admission process would end. Since there is no directive from the government for a final approval for these universities, the ACPC has started the admission process. So, it looks unlikely that these universities can avail the status this year,” said a source in ACPC. Of the total number of engineering seats, the admission committee is entrusted with the task to fill half. With the CoE status, these seven universities will not only be exempted from centralized admission process but will also be able to determine their fee independently. The seven institutes that have received a green light from include Nirma University Ahmedabad, Ahmedabad University, Charotar University of Science and Technology Anand, Pandit Deendayal Energy University Gandhinagar, Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology Gandhinagar, Marwadi University Rajkot and CEPT University Ahmedabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/coe-status-pending-acpc-allots-seats/articleshow/86304353.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Donations double at Ambaji temple compared to 2019||AHMEDABAD: The Ambaji temple has seen a huge surge in the past two months with weekly donations doubling as compared to pre-Covid times. From about Rs 30 lakh of weekly donations in pre-Covid times it touched Rs 60 lakhs in the first week of September, said Savjibhai Prajapati, account officer of Shri Arasuri Ambaji Mata Devasthan Trust (SAAMDT). The reason for this is that lakhs of pilgrims have taken a journey on foot to the famous temple shrine. Every year this ritual takes place during Bhadarvi Poonam when the fortnight-long mela is organized at Ambaji. This year the government has restricted holding melas as a precautionary measure for Covid-19. The Bhadaravi Poonam festive period starts from September 15 but pilgrims have started arriving in huge numbers from the beginning of September already, as a result of which the donations have shot up in the first two weeks of this month, said Prajapati. The average footfalls have also increased from 25,000-30,000 in the first half of September 2019 to 40,000 to 45,000 footfalls. “On September 5, which was a Sunday, about 60,000 devotees visited the shrine in a day,” he further said. In 2019, about 23 lakh devotees had visited the Shakti Peeth on Bhadarvi Poonam and contributions to the tune of Rs 4.5 crore were received in this period. The contributions had plummeted last year due to Covid-19 related restrictions. Donations that had dried up during Covid-19 crisis are again reaching pre-Covid levels at four famous temples including Somnath temple in Veraval, Dwarkadhish temple Dwarka town, Ambaji temple in Banaskantha and the Ranchhodrai temple at Dakor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/donations-double-at-ambaji-temple-as-compared-to-pre-covid-times/articleshow/86304375.cms||Bharat Yagnik

Later, she started threatening him and asked him to pay Rs 15,000 to get the video deleted.” After the victim paid her, he got a phone call from another person who claimed to be a cyber cell officer from Durgapuri. He told the victim to get the obscene video deleted from YouTube and other social media sites. When the complainant contacted the YouTuber who had supposedly uploaded the video, he, too, demanded money to delete it. Using the call detail record analysis and technical surveillance, both accused were arrested from Mewat following a raid, Tayal said.

---||Dehradun||Doon court grants 78 adjournments, SC says complete trial in 6 months||Dehradun: The Supreme Court has directed a lower court in Dehradun to complete trial in a case of cheating and forgery within six months after it emerged that the court had granted at least 78 adjournments in the case in seven years but charges were yet to be framed against the three accused. Observing that the trial court had “not moved an inch” in these years, a bench headed by Justice A M Khanwilkar, Justice Dinesh Maheshwari and Justice C T Ravikumar on Wednesday directed police to ensure that the witnesses are present on the scheduled dates for examination by the trial court. In 2012, an FIR was registered in Uttar Pradesh’s Meerut district against three people – Maneesh Verma, Sanju Verma and Neetu Verma – after the complainant, Atul Krishna, alleged cheating and forgery in a property matter. The accused were booked under section 420 (cheating), 406 (punishment for criminal breach of trust), 467 (forgery of valuable security, will), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating) and 470 (forged document or electronic record) of the Indian Penal Code. Since the property in question was in Dehradun, the case was transferred there. The trial court began hearing the case in 2014. According to the complainant’s petition in the apex court, in the six-year period between June 2014 and October 2020, the trial court adjourned the case at least 78 times. The court is yet to frame charges against the accused, the complainant alleged. The petitioner had also approached the Uttarakhand high court last year, requesting the court to give directions to speed up the trial process, but his plea was dismissed following which he filed a petition in the Supreme Court earlier this year. While hearing Krishna's plea, the apex court said it was required to issue directions to the lower court as it “failed to move even an inch in the last seven years, including to frame charges, as may be necessary, despite 78 adjournments in the case. Accordingly, the trial court must proceed in the matter without any further delay.” After the last hearing of the apex court in the case, the three accused, who have been out on bail for the last decade, had surrendered. The court extended their bail and said the trial court can cancel it if they do not cooperate in the progress of the trial or take unnecessary adjournments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/doon-court-grants-78-adjournments-sc-says-complete-trial-in-6-months/articleshow/86302049.cms||Prashant Jha

Minister of state for MSME, Bhanu Pratap Singh Verma launched the SPIN Scheme in which 780 potters from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan and Jharkhand have registered for financial assistance from banks to begin their own business. Out of these, 110 artisans are from Varanasi. Speaking on the occasion, Verma said that SPIN is a specially designed programme to make potters self-sustainable. Under the scheme, KVIC will facilitate potters to get easy loans from banks that will help the potters to diversify their activities and enhance their income. “This will reduce their dependence on government subsidy and thus make our potters self-reliant,” Verma said. He further said that the new Kashi pottery cluster will help traditional potters in increasing their skills with the help of modern equipment which will eventually help them occupy a bigger market space and get a better income. According to the KVIC chairman Vinai Kumar Saxena, unlike Kumhar Sashaktikaran Yojana, which is a subsidy-based programme, SPIN Scheme enables the registered potters to get a direct loan from banks under the Pradhan Mantri Shishu Mudra Yojana. Under the SPIN Scheme, KVIC is acting as a facilitator for financial aid to potters through RBL bank and also providing training to the artisans who opt for this scheme. Under this scheme, there will be no financial burden on the exchequer and the loan will be repaid by the potter in easy instalments. The SPIN scheme, thus, aims at infusing self-sustainability in the Indian pottery sector. Verma also inaugurated “Kashi Pottery Cluster” at Bhatti village. Saxena said that this is the first pottery cluster in Varanasi district set up by KVIC under the SFURTI Scheme. The cluster, set up over an area of 7,100 square feet at the cost of Rs 2.50 crore, has provided direct employment to 340 pottery artisans who have been trained by KVIC. The cluster is equipped with modern equipment like furnaces, electric potter wheels, blunger machines, pug mills and other modern equipment for higher production of clay pottery. Saxena said sustainable development by creating local self-employment is the key objective of KVIC which is aligned with the PM’s commitment of “Job to Every Hand” (Har Hath Me Kaam). “The SPIN Scheme and Kashi Pottery Cluster will play a major role in empowering the potters’ community, which is the dream of the Prime Minister. Apart from pottery, KVIC will also explore strengthening other traditional arts under the SPIN Scheme,” Saxena said. In addition to this, KVIC distributed tool sets to 80 carpentry artisans in Varanasi and also planted 2000 bamboo saplings at Sewapuri Ashram in Varanasi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/kvic-launches-spin-pottery-cluster-to-mark-pms-birthday/articleshow/86306841.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||After ministers, babus likely to face shake-up||Gandhinagar: After a complete overhaul of both the cabinet of ministers and officials posted in the chief minister’s office (CMO), there is a strong buzz that the state’s bureaucracy is likely to undergo a major reshuffle in the coming fortnight. At present, Manoj Das, additional chief secretary (ACS) in the CMO of Vijay Rupani, secretary to CM Ashwani Kumar, and officer on special duty (OSD) D H Shah are awaiting regular posting after new officials were appointed in their place. The government will also have to appoint a new ACS, finance, after Pankaj Joshi was made the new ACS to CM Bhupendra Patel. Joshi holds the additional charge of Bharuch-based GNFC and is expected to be relieved of that as well. Avantika Singh Aulakh, CEO of Gujarat Maritime Board, who has been appointed as secretary to the CM, may continue to hold the additional charge. Key sources close to the development said, “The message given by dropping all sitting ministers is very clear that the BJP high command wishes to infuse new vigour in the administration. Many of the ministers had developed convenient relations with their department secretaries. Along with a change in ministers, there is likely to be a massive change in the bureaucracy as well. A majority of the transfers effected in the reshuffle in July are likely to be impacted.” “There is strong buzz that the new CM will change district collectors and other field-level officials who were appointed by his predecessor. A major round of transfers is expected in both IAS and IPS circles in the next week or 10 days. This will have a huge impact on next year’s elections,” sources added. All major departments in the state government are likely to get new official heads.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/after-ministers-babus-likely-to-face-shake-up/articleshow/86304466.cms||Kapil Dave
---||Ahmedabad||Cadila’s Sepsivac gets Philippines’ nod||Ahmedabad: Ahmedabad-based Cadila Pharmaceuticals’ Sepsivac drug, an immunomodulator used in the treatment of leprosy, has received the approval to be used in the treatment of Covid-19 in the Philippines. The Food and Drug Administration of the Philippines gave its nod on September 15, said a company official. “We had a very encouraging experience with Sepsivac during the second wave in India when the medical fraternity found it very effective,” said Mahidhwaj Sisodia, executive vice-president of Cadila’s international formulations business. “This has encouraged us to start sharing our experience with medical fraternities of several countries in formal and informal ways.” The company had simultaneously approached regulatory agencies of various countries across geographies for the emergency use permission. “These efforts got their first success when the Philippines’ health authorities gave a compassionate special permit to Sepsivac for restricted usage in treating Covid. Supply has already been initiated,” Sisodia said. The drug uses mycobacterium w (Mw) and has been developed jointly by the National Institute of Immunology, New Delhi; the department of biotechnology, the Government of India; and Cadila Pharma. Sepsivac, originally licensed for use in sepsis patients, is being repositioned as a drug against Covid-19 in moderate and serious cases and has so far given positive results. The efficacy of Sepsivac is found to be 70.3% for protection against Covid-19 in healthy persons, according to a research study titled ‘Innate Immune Modulation and Resistance to Covid-19’. The study was published in European Journal of Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Science in May. The study monitored 3,831 people for the development of symptomatic Covid-19 between June 1, 2020, and October 15, 2020. The study period coincided with peak of the first wave of the pandemic in India. “Based on close cooperation among all the members of ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations), we expect health authorities of other countries to take a similar view,” Sisodia said. “…and play a meaningful role in assisting efforts to address difficult situations and help people at large.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cadilas-sepsivac-gets-philippines-nod/articleshow/86304464.cms||---
---||Kochi||Maharaja’s synthetic track to be elevated to int’l standards||Kochi: In an effort to make the Maharaja’s College ground and its synthetic track a venue for international and national sporting events, the authorities have decided to prepare a detailed project report (DPR) for the purpose. The synthetic track will be renovated as per athletics federation of India (AFI) standards so that international meets can be conducted at the college ground. According to experts, Kochi has several advantages for hosting international meets like proximity of airport and accommodation facilities at par with global standards. AFI had given its provisional licence to Maharaja’s College ground a few years ago. Now, the licence has to be renewed. Moreover, the ground and synthetic track will have to be renovated as per international standards. The team from AFI will conduct an inspection before giving final approval for the college ground to host international sporting events. Last month, the higher education department had provided Rs 6.9 crore for renovating the synthetic track. The synthetic track has been in a dilapidated condition for the past few years. After the issue came to the notice of sports minister V Abdurahiman, he inspected the ground and track. Physical education department of Maharaja’s College had prepared an estimate for renovating the synthetic track in 2018. As per the estimate prepared by the department, it would cost Rs 6.9 crore for the project. Officials with the PWD, which the government has fixed as the implementing agency, said that the estimate would have to be revised as the cost of raw materials and other expenses have changed over the years. According to Kerala state sports council president Mercy Kuttan, there won’t be any need for additional funds. “The synthetic track can be renovated using the Rs 6.9 crore. The renovation of synthetic track at G V Raja Sport School in Thiruvananthapuram could be constructed at a cost of a little over Rs 6 crore recently. In the case of the synthetic track at Maharaja’s, a strong foundation is already there. So, the amount would be enough,” Kuttan said. A meeting attended by mayor M Anil Kumar, MLA T J Vinod, officials and other stakeholders on Friday decided to prepare the DPR by the end of the month. Representatives of Kerala state sports council, Maharaja’s College physical education department, PWD and experts should prepare the DPR with a view to elevate the track to global standards. “Once the DPR is ready, the work can be completed within two months,” Kuttan said. Mayor said that a master plan for the development of the college ground should be prepared. Funds from various agencies can be utilized for implementing the master plan, he said. Besides renovating the synthetic track, warm up areas will also be developed. Runways of high jump, long jump and javelin throw should also be renovated. Hockey and basketball courts should be renovated using the remaining funds. A meeting to be attended by mayor, Vinod, Kuttan, Maharaja’s College authorities, PWD and other stakeholders next month will go through the DPR and take further measures to expedite the work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/maharajas-synthetic-track-to-be-elevated-to-intl-standards/articleshow/86302089.cms||---
---||Delhi||South Delhi civic body looks to strengthen infra at 3 of its hospitals to meet heavy footfall||NEW DELHI: South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) is planning to strengthen the medical facilities at its hospitals in Tilak Nagar, Kalkaji and Nehru Nagar by the end of the year to cater to a larger footfall. To begin with, the five-storey Tilak Nagar hospital would soon become fully operational. While the medical services on the ground and first floors would be made operational by October 1, a fire NOC is required for the upper floors. “We have applied to Delhi Fire Service and expect to get the NOC by October 30, after which all floors will be made operational by the year-end. The hospital gets heavy footfall even on a normal day, so we expect it to increase when all services start,” said SDMC additional commissioner Randhir Sahay. The hospital was opened in January 2020 with basic medical services to cater to five lakh people living in west Delhi. Spread over 19,157.5 sqm, it was constructed at a cost of Rs 64.5 crore. From October 1, the hospital would get the city’s first single-membrane dialysis system, which would be available to patients at CGHS rates of Rs 1,400. Other facilities include a 14-bed emergency ward, maternity and paediatric wards and OTs on the ground and first floors. “On the ground floor, there will be an OPD and 24-hour emergency ward. Half the first floor will be for OPD and the rest for OTs to conduct minor operations, antenatal ward and labour room. The second floor will have 20 maternity beds, 20 paediatric beds and Ayush clinic. The third floor will have 20 beds for medicine ward (general). The fourth floor will have 13 private rooms for patients. The fifth floor will have ICU and two main OT where ENT and eye surgeries will be done,” said a senior official. The OPD would be available for ENT, eye, dermatology, general, ortho, dental, radiology and ultrasound. Dialysis of 20 patients can be done daily. This facility would also start from October 1 at the Kalkaji hospital. “At the 40-bedded Purnima Sethi Hospital and the 50-bedded Nehru Nagar hospital, piped oxygen supply has been created. If things remain normal and Covid-19 cases don’t increase, we will resume the services for normal patients,” said a senior SDMC official. At the Nehru Nagar Chest Clinic and TB Hospital, two blocks are operational for keeping 6-7 patients. “We have plans to start OPDs for other medical consultations too,” added the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sdmc-looks-to-strengthen-infra-at-3-of-its-hospitals-to-meet-heavy-footfall/articleshow/86304516.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Ludhiana||Housing, urban ministry secy: Pace of works fine||Ludhiana: Secretary of ministry of housing and urban authority Durga Shanker Mishra was satisfied with the ongoing Smart City works during his visit to the city to review the projects on Friday. Mishra, while talking to the mediapersons, said, “Earlier, the pace of projects was a bit slow, but now it’s going on well.” Regarding parameters for the works, he said, “There is a technical team for checking specifications.”Earlier in the morning, he reviewed the works going on under the Smart City mission in Ludhiana, Amritsar, Patiala and other cities. Some of the officers had come to the city for this meeting, while others joined virtually. After the closed-door meeting, he went to have a look at the ongoing works at sewerage treatment plant in Jamalpur under the Buddha Nullah rejuvenation project, Mini Rose Garden, Animal Birth Control Centre at Hambran Road, Sidhwan Canal Waterfront, Malhar Road and ROB/RUB at Pakhowal Road railway crossing. He reviewed PM Swainidhi Scheme from a fruit vendor in Sarabha Nagar market to find if he was registered with the scheme and was getting its benefits. Stray dogs removed While complaints of residents about stray dogs had always fallen on deaf ears of the officials, on Friday, a team of dog catchers reached the Sarabha Nagar market for taking away the animals. Officials were in the field early morning and catching of stray dogs went on at full tilt. Senior vet officer Dr Harban Dhalla told the secretary they had sterilised 3,480 dogs from April 1 to September 16.  As heavy rainfall left roads submerged, officials were on their toes in some areas draining out rainwater.Engrs’ body: Nothing smart about cityCouncil of Engineers president Kapil Arora handed over a memorandum to the secretary about certain issues related with the Smart City. The memorandum said even after five years, smart city citizens’ forum has not been constituted by the special purpose vehicle (SPV), so there was no residents’ participation in the projects. He said projects were being executed without involvement of various representatives, thus violating the Smart City Act. The width of Malhar Road has been decreased and the bases of trees have been covered with interlocking concrete tiles against the directions of the NGT and the environment norms, it said. The memorandum said no parking space was left for four-wheelers, so cars were being parked on the so-called smart road.Besides, the LED lights project was a complete failure as most remained off during the night and Sarabha Nagar market project was still incomplete as wires were yet to be laid underground. The construction of ROB/RUB at Pakhowal Road railway crossing misappropriated Smart City funds and there was nothing “smart” in it as it was just a flyover with a simple design, the memo said. The installation of static compactor was going at a snail’s pace and there was no segregation of dry and wet waste, the council said, adding that the solid waste at Tajpur dump was increasing by the day and there was no proper planning for solid waste management.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/housing-urban-ministry-secy-pace-of-works-fine/articleshow/86302066.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Lucknow to get another eco-tourism spot||LUCKNOW: Acknowledging the potential of the wetland just behind the Atal Bihari Vajpayee International (Ekana) Stadium, the state forest department and Lucknow Development Authority (LDA) have agreed to develop it into an eco-forest. In an in-principle bi-partite agreement between DFO Ravi Kumar Singh and LDA VC Akshay Tripathi on Thursday, the two bodies decided to name it as Chak Ganjaria Wet Land. Both the bodies also agreed to begin their work with water regulation and mutation of the place. Sources said that the official notification is expected sometime next week. Spread across nearly 37 acres (nearly 4km), the wetland is inhabited by over 100 species of indigenous and migratory birds, including some listed in Schedule 1 of the Wildlife Protection Act, according to naturalists and bird enthusiasts. Besides the regular presence of ducks, bee-eaters, kingfishers, sparrows, parakeets and jacanas, deer, golden jackal, monitor lizards, water snakes and butterflies, some extremely rare and shy migratory birds also make this place their home every winter. Worried that the oasis barely a few kilometres from Hazratganj may lose to rapid urbanisation in the area, the eco-warriors urged chief minister Yogi Adityanath to save the place. TOI was the first one to write about the treasure and beauty of Ekana Wetland on February 28, 2020. Taking a note of the matter, the office of the CM asked authorities concerned to undertake efforts to save the place. Secretary to CM, also a wildlife enthusiast, Alok Kumar took keen interest in pushing for the cause. “The growing importance of urban forestry is what drove the CM to give a thought to the request made by the naturalists’ group. In the years to come, the place will give a new identity to the character of Lucknow,” said Kumar. “Mission Ekana wetland looks forward to a bright future now,” said wildlife enthusiast Vivek Awasthi, reminding that India has recently supported the Convention on Migratory Birds (CMS), the only UN treaty that addresses the issue of migratory birds and their habitats. A regular visitor, Ratindra Pandey, said: “This is a win-win deal for all. The city will get an oasis, residents will get a new destination to hang out, the government gets to add a new eco-tourism spot without having to invest much and we get the happiness of being able to save a piece of nature.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/city-to-get-another-eco-tourism-spot/articleshow/86306868.cms||Shailvee Sharda

Then, he jumped into the canal and ended his life, too. Their bodies were recovered by local swimmers. The police registered a case of murder against deceased Bhavesh Prajapati for killing his daughters Hensi, 5, and Pansi, 3. Bhavesh’ brother-in-law Prakash Prajapati said in his FIR that his sister Manisha had married Bhavesh, a resident of Palsana village, around seven years ago. They had two daughters from their marriage. “For around a year, Manisha suffered from mental illness and depression. A month ago, she committed suicide by consuming poison. This left Bhavesh shattered,” Prakash told police. Unable to handle the situation, Bhavesh also showed signs of depression. On Thursday afternoon, Bhavesh reportedly messaged Prakash that he was going to commit suicide with his daughters and then went incommunicado. Prakash contacted other family members who launched a search for Bhavesh and the girls. They found Bhavesh’s scooter abandoned near the Narmada canal in Ramnagar village and hired local swimmers to look for them. Prakash said that the swimmers recovered Bhavesh’s body first. Then, they found the bodies of the girls tied together with a dupatta. Kalol taluka police sent the bodies for post mortem at Gandhinagar Civil Hospital and later filed a complaint of murder against Bhavesh as he had thrown his daughters into the canal before committing suicide.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/upset-over-wifes-death-man-drowns-daughters-self/articleshow/86304507.cms||---

Newly appointed chief minister Bhupendra Patel is likely to kick-start the campaign by next week. A key source aware of the development said, “Huge money spent on the publicity material highlighting former CM Vijay Rupani and deputy CM Nitin Patel is wasted now.” The source added, “Hoardings across the state; publicity material of all the schemes; photos of the CM in all government offices and calendars; and posters on ST buses, among others, will have to be changed.” He went on to say: “Long-term publicity contracts will also have to be revised to include the photos of the new CM and ministers.” Sources said that although the preparation and estimation of the campaign to promote the new CM may take a few days, it is expected to be very aggressive keeping the next year’s assembly elections in mind. Sources further said that in the next couple of days, the CM is expected to launch new field-level public-engagement programmes which will be indirectly aimed at branding the new government. “More direct engagement about the schemes for public benefit will be planned with new names,” the source said. “A few programmes are likely to start in the next two weeks. Expenditure of the new campaign will be accounted for in the supplementary budget, so there might not be a direct special budget allocation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/poll-in-mind-cm-to-launch-new-branding-drive/articleshow/86304531.cms||Kapil Dave

As a result, devotees continued to perform immersion directly in the river on Friday. The practice of land immersion had started in the city in 2019 on the directions of the high court. Devotees who came for immersion said they themselves were keen on eco-friendly immersion but LMC had not made any arrangements for it, which is a violation of the court order. Earlier, the civic body used to make several artificial ponds and deploy personnel for cleaning, but at present, there is only one pit which is filled with garbage with no one to clean it. The issue was raised by TOI earlier this week. LMC officers had assured that arrangements for land immersion will be made soon. However, it turned out to be only lip service. “If the civic body had provided an alternative just like the previous years, we would not have to immerse the idol in the Gomti,” said Harshit Vishwakarma. Vineet Saini said, “There is so much trash in the artificial pond, no one can think of immersing idols in it.” Additional municipal commissioner Abhay Pandey said, “A private agency has been directed to clean all artificial ponds. We will conduct a site visit and clean the artificial ponds for immersion.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lmc-made-no-ponds-devotees-immersing-idols-in-gomti-river/articleshow/86306925.cms||---

According to the officials, the three had shown opium was recovered from Gurdeep Singh, a farmer, at a checkpost, whereas a police team had raided his house from where the seizure was allegedly made. The police will now start the process to cancel the FIR as its facts are incorrect.After the SIT was formed, sub-inspector Simranjeet Kaur was transferred to the police lines in August. On July 25, the Meharban police had arrested Gurdeep, a resident of Noorwala village. The FIR stated that he was nabbed from a checkpost at Noorwala Chowk when he was going in his car (PB 91 E-2000) and 100g of opium was recovered from his possession. However, according to Gurdeep’s family, the SHO, along with her team, had visited their house and searched it for one-and-a-half hour and when she could not find anything, she took him along and later arrested him and lodged an FIR. His family had also submitted to the senior cops CCTV footage of the incident.Joint commissioner of police (headquarters) J Elanchezhian said, “A three-member team, comprising ADCP (investigation) Rupinder Kaur Bhatti, ADCP-1 Pragya Jain and ADCP-IV Rupinder Kaur Sra, conducted the investigation. The preliminary inquiry stated that the cops mentioned the place of recovery as a checkpost, whereas the CCTV footage confirmed that the police team had visited the house of Gurdeep and took him into custody. Therefore, sub-inspectors Simranjeet Kaur and Rajandeep Singh and ASI Kamaljeet Singh have been suspended. The police will also start the process to cancel the FIR.”About the allegations of implicating Gurdeep in the case and taking Rs 1.50 lakh bribe, Elanchezhian said, “It is being investigated.”Hardeep Kaur, Gurdeep’s wife, alleged that the police team had taken Rs 1.50 lakh from their house while searching it. “Also, the former SHO took Rs 1.50 lakh more to not implicate Gurdeep’s elder brother in the case. Due to a rivalry, our neighbour made the former SHO frame Gurdeep in the drug peddling case. We are waiting for the day when the FIR against my husband will be cancelled. We also want the inquiry team to reveal why Gurdeep was implicated in the case,” Hardeep added.‘Action after HC sought report’Gurdeep’s wife, Hardeep Kaur, said, “As we were not satisfied with the police investigation, we had approached the Punjab and Haryana high court. The high court had sought a report from the Ludhiana police after which the city cops took action.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/meharbans-former-sho-among-3-cops-suspended/articleshow/86302117.cms||Payal Dhawan

They had visited the office of a businessman at Kalbadevi in South Mumbai on Tuesday on the pretext of checking GST deposits and allegedly took Rs 11 lakh from the office. Police arrested Hitesh Vasaikar (40), a Mahim resident, two sales tax inspectors and the consultant. A court remanded them to police custody till Saturday. On September 14, at 4.45pm, Lalchand Vanigota (63), who worked for a businessman for 22 years, was in office with two employees when four persons entered. They introduced themselves as GST inspectors and asked about payments by the firm. The complainant’s employer has dozens of rooms as landlord on ‘pagdi’ system. His employees collect rent from the rooms and bring money to office and deposit it in the company’s bank account. The accused told the three employees to keep all the cash on the table. The employees kept Rs 30 lakh, which was in office. The accused asked for GST documents and later said they were carrying Rs 11 lakh, which would be deposited as GST. They also told Vanigota to come to their Mazgaon office and check it. The four left office after taking Rs 11 lakh. Vanigota informed his employer about the visit by GST officials. The employer asked Vanigota to check if they were genuine. They went to the Mazgaon office and asked about the raid/survey by GST officials but were told that no raid was conducted by their office nor was any officials sent to the area as described by the victim. The complainant realised they were cheated and approached police. An FIR for cheating and personating a public servant was registered against the fake GST officials. Police scanned CCTV footage and found the four taking a taxi after the crime and going to Mahim. They were identified and arrested on Thursday. During questioning police found three of them were sales tax inspectors but were involved in the crime. Police later added sections 384 (punishment for extortion) and 385 (putting a person in fear of injury to commit extortion) of IPC. “We recovered the Rs 11 lakh from the accused. A further probe is on,” said inspector O M Wangate of LT Marg police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-3-tax-inspectors-walk-away-with-rs-11l-from-bizmans-office-held/articleshow/86306956.cms||Mateen Hafeez

---||Mumbai||For 5th year, Maharashtra records most graft cases; low conviction rate||MUMBAI: For the fifth consecutive year in a row, from 2016-20, Maharashtra recorded most corruption cases in the country though cases have been steadily declining over two years. The state had an abysmally low conviction rate of 7.8% in the pandemic year of 2020, according to data released by National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). It appears that senior government officers are not interested in acting against their corrupt subordinates caught for graft: Only 11 accused were removed from service and eight got minor punishments from department heads in 2020. TimesViewA low conviction rate in corruption cases discourages people from coming forward to complain against corrupt public servants. When departmental action is not taken against corrupt public officers, it will give rise to suspicion that there is a mala fide intent and quid pro quo to allow tainted officers to go unpunished. The justice system requires to be overhauled for faster disposal of cases so as to instill confidence among the public.The state recorded 664 corruption cases last year, which was a 26% decline from 891 in 2019. Officers attribute this to government offices functioning partially during lockdown and fewer people stepping out of home to approach them. “One reason for declining corruption cases over two years is greater digitisation of services offered by government. When services are available online, there is lesser scope of human interference. That does not mean corruption will go away completely,” said Pravin Dixit, former DGP and head of Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB). He added that if a once-tainted public servant is posted in the same office in future, it discourages people from lodging graft complaints. Maharashtra has more than 6,000 pending corruption cases in court, a key reason why convictions are low. By the time a case is heard, the investigating officer is transferred or has retired from service, and witnesses turn hostile.  “In trap cases, investigators have to get sanction from a competent authority (officer who has appointed accused). Typically, taking this sanction takes a long time,” said activist Anil Galgali. Around 95% of corruption cases recorded last year were trap cases. To improve conviction rates, Dixit advices taking a leaf out of Gujarat ACB’s books. “Gujarat ACB started to rope in law graduates as interns. After evidence was gathered and paperwork prepared, the interns would scrutinise the work done and plug loopholes,” he said. Gujarat and MP have better conviction rates of 44% and 56% respectively. “We have given a detailed checklist to ACB officers in Maharashtra on shortcomings in previous cases that need to be kept in mind while chargesheeting fresh cases,” said a senior ACB officer. A case recorded when lockdown was strict last year was that of a sub-divisional police officer (SDPO) from Thane (rural) demanding a bribe of Rs 12.5 lakh from a complainant for helping him secure bail and unfreeze his bank account. The SDPO had also roped in three private individuals for the offence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/for-5th-year-maharashtra-records-most-graft-cases-low-conviction-rate/articleshow/86306991.cms||Nitasha Natu

---||Dehradun||Haridwar municipal corporation to now run Mansa Devi ropeway service||Haridwar: The Mansa Devi ropeway — used to ferry devotees to the Mansa Devi temple situated in the Shivalik hills — will now be managed by the Haridwar municipal corporation, according to an order issued by secretary of the urban development department. This brings to an end an over four-decade-old agreement with Usha Breco, a Kolkata-based company. In 1974, the ropeway service was installed at Mansa Devi by Usha Breco. Since then, the company had been looking after the management of the ropeway service under an agreement signed between the private firm and Haridwar municipal council (now municipal corporation). This contract expired on May 20 this year. Soon after, the municipal corporation adopted a unanimous resolution to extend the contract for another 30 years. However, the urban development department has now pointed out that the norms of the Uttarakhand Acquisition Manual were bypassed while passing the resolution. Besides, fresh tenders were also not floated to invite applications from private firms interested in running the ropeway. Therefore, the department has now tasked the district’s municipal corporation with running the service. The order added that the ropeway service can only be opened for devotees after experts from IIT-Roorkee undertake its electromechanical and civil examination. This examination, according to the letter, is necessary as the ropeway is more than 40 years old. The decision of the urban development department has been welcomed by Haridwar municipal corporation mayor Anita Sharma. She said the management of Mansa Devi ropeway service will bring in the much-needed revenue for the civic body. However, BJP’s Sunil Agrawal, who is the leader of opposition in the civic body, is skeptical of the decision. He said that the civic body, at present, is not even able to carry out door-to-door garbage collection and there is a likelihood that the corporation will incur losses in running the ropeway service. He added that the urban development department should not have overruled the unanimous resolution of the corporation. Meanwhile, Haridwar resident Manoj Gehtori, who is also the public relations officer at the Uttarakhand Sanskrit University, has said that the recent decision will keep the ticket prices of ropeway service in check. “This step will help pilgrims provided the civic body does not indulge in corruption,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/haridwar-municipal-corporation-to-now-run-mansa-devi-ropeway-service/articleshow/86302197.cms||Sheo S Jaiswal
---||Lucknow||Food pesticides causing rise in C-sections, lower birth weight: KGMU study||LUCKNOW: The presence of pesticides in our food and the environment not only disrupts our hormones and brings about developmental changes in our growing years but also starts affecting children even before they are born, a pioneering study by the biochemistry department of King George’s Medical University has found. The study, which has featured in a high impact environmental research journal, has also found correlation between lower birth weight, cesarean deliveries in preterm births and the level of pesticide toxicity. The study included research on pregnant mothers and cord blood samples of 221 healthy pairs from Queen Mary’s hospital and deduced a correlation between transplacental transfer of pesticides resulting into chemical alterations and pregnancy outcome in non-occupational women. According to Prof Abbas Ali Mahdi, the author of the study, indiscriminate use of pesticides has been found to be a factor in low birth weight in newborns, preterm deliveries and also with an increase rate of complications due to the cell damage, leading to a higher rate of cesarean deliveries. Moreover, pesticides can disturb hormonal balance in women by decreasing the hormone progesterone and alter antioxidant defence mechanisms during normal uncomplicated pregnancies which can also steer to preterm birth, said Prof Mahdi, the head of the biochemistry department. “This is a pioneering study where we have looked at both the cause and effect of pesticides on pregnant women, unborn children and their health and development after birth. The process of study through cord blood samples of the foetus and the maternal blood in such a high sample size is also a distinctive factor,” said Prof Mahdi. “India has banned several pesticides but there is still an indiscriminate use of pesticides on our food and agricultural produce which then percolate into our environment too. So since the time of conception, the foetus starts to get the toxic elements of pesticides leading to biochemical changes, DNA changes, cell damage and genetic changes as well,” he added. The study does not capture pregnant women living by the fields or factories but non-occupational women who are urban residents of northern India, pointing to the widespread presence of pesticides causing us more harm than good. “This could also be the reason for unexplainable widespread incidence of chronic diseases like cancer, birth defects, reproductive disorders, neurodegenerative, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, developmental disorders, metabolic disorders including diabetes, chronic renal disorders, liver disorders or autoimmune diseases.  These markers found in our study can be used for early detection of pesticide related ailments and toxicities,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/food-pesticides-causing-rise-in-c-sections-lower-birth-wt/articleshow/86307042.cms||Yusra Husain

The event held to mark the 71st birthday of PM Modi on September 17 was organized by the Gujarat State Commission for Protection of Child Rights. The District Primary Education Officers (DPEOs) had, earlier this week, issued a notification in this connection to all self-financed, government-run and grant-in-aid schools of the state. Every school was asked to participate by nominating at least 10 students for the essay-writing competition. “Participation was voluntary. The idea behind holding such an event is that children can express their feelings about our prime minister and their respect for him. Children in this age group are known to express their feelings freely and honestly,” said Jagruti Pandya, chairperson of Gujarat State Commission for Protection of Child Rights. The commission has in the past held events on child rights, extempore, drawing competition among others, she further said. Every school is to hold the competition on September 17 and send their entries to the commission on the same day, as per the notification. Three winning entries from every district will be announced, and trophies and certificates will be given to the winners. About 50,000 students from by Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation-run schools have participated in the event. “Schools can hold the competition even after September 17.

---||Mumbai||In a relief to aged parents, Bombay HC asks man to vacate flat||MUMBAI: Coming to the aid of senior citizen parents, the Bombay high court has directed a man and his family to vacate a flat within 10 days, failing which police would be used to forcibly evict them. Justice Girish Kulkarni passed the order while rejecting the man’s claims over the flat. The man had challenged a 2020 order by a tribunal to vacate the flat in Juhu Koliwada. The HC in its September 15 order said, “This is a sad case where a man, along with his wife and child, dragged his father and mother, who are aged 90 years and 89 years, respectively, into protracted legal proceedings.” The HC after hearing the son’s counsel, Yashpal Thakur, and senior counsel Abhay Khandeparker for the parents, said it appeared that, as a last resort, the parents invoked the provisions of the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007, and the special tribunal under the Act granted relief to the parents, against which the son and his family moved the high court. The HC said, “It is clear that in the present case, the petitioners cannot set up any competing claim in the absence of any legal right, whatsoever, in respect of the flat in question.” The HC rejected his plea to stay its (HC’s) order saying that the family has continued to reside in the house despite the October 2020 order, “to the detriment of the parents” and a stay “would add to the agony and pain of the parents.” “The misery of the parents at such an advanced stage of their lives, however, did not end as it appears from their case before the tribunal that the son and his wife with a view to forcibly grab the flat in which the parents are residing and who had permitted the petitioners to reside along with them are harassing and torturing the parents for the past many years,” said the high court order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/in-a-relief-to-aged-parents-bombay-hc-asks-man-to-vacate-flat/articleshow/86307080.cms||---

---||Dehradun||BJP poll in-charge slams Harish Rawat for 'Jai Ganesh' slogan||DEHRADUN: With state elections inching closer, the battle cry of 'Jai Ganesh' given by former CM Harish Rawat has yet again brought the Congress and the BJP face to face. Taking a swipe at the ex-CM's slogan, Union minister and BJP's election in-charge Pralhad Joshi said, "He has given a slogan of ‘Jai Ganesh’ and has pitched it against ‘Jai Shri Ram’. This reflects the level of immaturity of both Rawat and Rahul Gandhi. They are trying to mislead people." The former Uttarakhand CM hit back soon after accusing the BJP of using the name of “Lord Ram” for politics and saying, “I fail to understand why the state and BJP's top leadership is baffled with the slogan." Addressing mediapersons at BJP state headquarters on Friday, Joshi said, “Just look at their maturity level, we have been saying slogans of 'Lord Ram' and 'Ganesh' for ages and Gandhi has now approved the slogan for election. In Maharashtra, Congress are coalition partners and they need to remind the government to lift restrictions on Ganesh Chathurthi celebrations and here Rawat is saying Jai Ganesh.” Accusing Rawat of politicising the Char Dham Yatra, Joshi said that barring state president Ganesh Godiyal, everyone is opposed to Rawat in the Congress. “Rawat has failed to keep the team together. Congress is now past and they require binoculars to find candidates." On being asked about the preparations for the assembly polls, Joshi said the BJP will win more than 60 seats. "We will break the myth that Congress and BJP alternatively form government in the state by retaining power in Uttarakhand," he added. On BJP ticket distribution, Joshi said the party was looking into various factors before announcing the names. The BJP leader further said that “by projecting a former defence personnel as CM candidate, AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal was trying to gain public sympathy.” Harish Rawat meanwhile through a Facebook post questioned why the state and BJP's top leadership was baffled with the 'Jai Shri Ganesh' slogan. “Lord Ganesh is called Vighnaharta – destroyer of all obstacles – and taking his name before any occasion is regarded auspicious. This slogan is not for any kind of revenge. We have an unflinching faith in Lord Ram and are his devotees. BJP is using the name of Ram for politics and it is my advice to BJP members to learn saying Jai Shri Ganesh,” the former CM wrote.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/bjp-poll-in-charge-slams-harish-rawat-for-jai-ganesh-slogan/articleshow/86302318.cms||Kautilya Singh

The simian had snatched a bag containing Rs 2 lakh from unsuspecting Vinod Kumar Sharma, who was going to purchase stamp papers for a land registry in Rampur’s Shahabad town. As a crowd of curious people gathered, hooted and clapped, the monkey threw the bag down but not before taking out Rs 1 lakh. After another round of cajoling, the monkey started throwing the notes in the air. Now it was Sharma’s turn to plead before the cheering crowd, which was trying to pocket the money. After a lot of convincing, people collected the money and gave it to Sharma, who was nervous and sweating by then. After over 30 minutes of high-drama, the advocate was able to collect Rs 95,000. There was no trace of the remaining Rs 5,000, but Sharma was “happy”. The video of the monkey was shot by a few people, who later shared it on social media platforms. In October 2019, a similar incident was reported from Budaun district where two monkeys snatched a bag from a woman and showered money on people. Sharma said, “I got the shock of my life when the monkey snatched my bag and climbed on the neem tree. There were Rs 2lakh in the bag, which I had taken from a client for stamps. The monkey then took out two bundles of Rs 50,000 each from the bag and threw the bag. “When we tried to chase it, it climbed on the top branch of the tree and started showering money. I was helplessly watching and requesting people to return the money. I managed to get back Rs 95,000 from people. I don’t blame anyone for the remaining Rs 5,000 as most people were trying to help me. I haven not filed any complaint.” Affan Ahmad, an eye witness, told TOI, “I shot videos while Sharma along with other advocates were putting efforts to get the money back from the monkey. Sharma even took a risk and tried to climb on the tree through tin roof. He even slipped twice as the surface was slippery because of the rain. After 30 minutes, Sharma managed to get most of his money back. Monkeys often snatch bags of people visiting the court premises in Shahabad. A monkey had snatched Rs 5,000 from a clerk in 2018.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/monkey-rains-money-from-tree-after-snatching-advocates-bag-with-rs-2l-in-it/articleshow/86302350.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

With vibrant and splashy painted walls and colorful furniture it now looks no less than a private school. Not only this one, but hundred such preschools running in various anganwadis across the district have undergone complete transformation in the recent pandemic days under BaLA - Building as Learning Aid scheme. BaLA is meant to transform these anganwadis so that each and every corner of the building including the furniture can also be used as an education tool while making it attractive and enhancing activity based learning. As per Chief Development Officer CDO Jhansi, Shailesh Kumar, “Since buildings are the most expensive physical asset of a school, efforts have been made to derive maximum out of it. In addition we have used vibrant colours to attract children for coming to school. We have incurred around Rs 60-70 thousand per school for its rejuvenation programme. Since the schools are yet to reopen, we are waiting to observe the acceptance level of the children and their parents.” Talking to TOI, DM Jhansi, Andra Vamsi said, “The drive to rejuvenate these anganwadis is to attract more and more children for schooling by deriving the maximum output from the exterior, interior, outdoor spaces and structures of the building by modifying them innovatively and thus involving the kids towards creative learning. This will also help in promoting activity based learning and inclusive education for children with special needs.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/anganwadi-preschools-in-jhansi-get-a-facelift/articleshow/86307141.cms||---

The notification issued in October 2003 dealt with asset distribution between the two states. The UP government has challenged the validity of this notification arguing that it is ultra vires of the UP Reorganisation Act, 2000. The development was brought to the notice of the Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Thursday while it was hearing a couple of petitions regarding non-payment of salaries to the Uttarakhand Roadways workers. The bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma had in its previous hearing directed the Centre to hold a meeting between the transport secretaries of the two states and to resolve the issues of payment of dues to the transport corporation. However, the court was informed by the counsel appearing for Centre, VK Kapruwan, that the Centre had called a meeting where it was informed that UP had moved the SC challenging the validity of the 2003 notification. The court was further informed that notices have been issued in the matter, but the state of Uttarakhand is yet to file its response. The HC was also informed that both the states have taken opposite stands on the division of assets. “While the government of Uttarakhand claims that the division of the assets should be done on the basis of the prevailing 'market value', the government of Uttar Pradesh claims that it should be done on the basis of the 'book value'. Therefore, there is some disagreement between the two governments as to the basis on which the assets should be divided,” the court noted in its order. Till now, the Centre has held three meetings on the issue, but UP and Uttarakhand are yet to reach any conclusion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/asset-distribution-between-ukhand-up-up-moves-sc-challenging-18-yr-notification/articleshow/86302368.cms||Prashant Jha

This monsoon, the state has seen 704 mm rain which is about 94% of the normal,” he said. He said that there are around five to six districts which are still experiencing floods as rivers like Rapti, Sharda and Ghagra were flowing above the danger mark. “Relief work is taking place in these villages but overall there has been an improvement in the flood situation,” he said. In a meeting held on Friday, the CM directed all district magistrates and local officials to assess losses due to the heavy rainfall since Wednesday. The DMs and local bodies have also been directed to ensure that there is no water-logging. “The CM has said that all care should be taken to ensure that there is no spread of disease due to the rains and water-logging. All necessary arrangements should be made to ensure relief to affected persons. The health department has been directed to ensure that there is a sufficient number of doctors, paramedical staff and all necessary medicines in primary and community health centres and district hospitals,” said a government spokesperson. The CM has also directed officials to ensure that fogging is carried out to prevent the breeding of mosquitoes, especially as cases of dengue were being reported from various parts of the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/assess-losses-release-relief-material-yogi/articleshow/86307151.cms||---

Police said it was possible that a non-resident entered the society, which has three 22-storied buildings, and left the bag containing the body on the premises. On Tuesday morning, a woman sanitation worker had picked up garbage from a corridor in one of the three buildings and handed it over to two men segregating the trash. The two men found the baby’s body and immediately alerted the police. For now, the police have registered a case under Section 318 (secretly burying or otherwise disposing of the dead body of a child, whether before or after or during its birth; intentionally concealing or endeavouring to conceal the birth of such child) of the Indian Penal Code. Senior inspector Sunil Jadhav of the Chandannagar police told TOI on Friday that they have requested Sassoon General Hospital, where the body’s post-mortem was carried out, to preserve a DNA sample. “The medical authorities at Sassoon have collected and preserved a sample of the baby. The DNA sample could prove useful in establishing the biological parentage, in case we zero-in on a suspect. The post-mortem opinion is awaited; the viscera has been preserved for chemical analysis,” Jadhav said. He said the police have spoken to residents of the society in a bid to gather information. “The investigating team has asked residents if they knew of a pregnant woman living in the society. So far, the team has not received any actionable information. Even the CCTV footage from inside and outside the society failed to yield a clue, though we are still studying the footage. This led the investigators to think it is possible that an outsider left the bag in the society,” Jadhav added. Jadhav cited the opinion of medical experts at Sassoon and said it appeared that the baby was delivered in an unscientific manner at home, in the absence of a doctor. “Normally, a baby delivered in a hospital is cleaned up, but that was not the case in this matter,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/police-suspect-outsider-left-dead-infant-in-hsg-society/articleshow/86304802.cms||Asseem Shaikh
---||Lucknow||BJP’s OBC wing meeting kicks off in Ayodhya today||Lucknow: The two-day working committee meeting of BJP’s OBC frontal wing in Ayodhya on Saturday and Sunday will train the spotlight on the saffron party’s attempt to bring the electorally imperative backward bloc closer to its Hindutva agenda. The move, experts said, could potentially help BJP blur caste lines among OBC sub-groups, while bringing them under one umbrella in the run-up to assembly elections next year. Highly placed sources in BJP told TOI the decision to hold the meeting in Ayodhya, a key Hindutva nerve centre, has been deftly planned to consolidate its position among OBCs, while preparing ground to take on a belligerent opposition. “Backward castes have had a long association with Lord Ram. That sentiment needs to be kept alive and so we decided to hold the event in Ayodhya. OBCs play a compelling role in deciding the electoral fortunes of any political group. And, backwards have certainly been given their due by the BJP government at the Centre and in UP,” said state BJP OBC morcha president Narendra Kashyap while speaking to TOI. The development comes close on heels of BJP’s covert pursuit of cashing in on the legacy of Kalyan Singh — a senior backward caste BJP leader and former CM during whose regime the Babri mosque was razed on December 6, 1992 — who passed away after a prolonged illness on August 21. In fact, two weeks after his death, the Lodh leader’s legacy, which happens to be a blend of OBC and Hindutva, was put under focus while the party tried to consolidate its hold on the numerically dominant non-Yadav OBC bloc. BJP also whipped out a fresh OBC card by appointing Union education and skill development minister Dharmendra Pradhan, a prominent OBC face in the Narendra Modi cabinet, as party in charge of UP elections. BJP sources said, the meet organised at Ram Manohar Lohia Awadh University in Ayodhya, is expected to pass political resolutions highlighting higher representation of the community in the recent Union cabinet rejig, constitution status to OBC commission and allowing states to include various caste groups in the backward block. Kashyap claimed the measures taken by the Modi government at the Centre drew appreciation from OBC groups which otherwise were feeling neglected. Experts interpret the development as a key BJP endeavour to win over the OBC groups, which account for nearly 42% of the population. Sources said, BJP’s aggressive perusal of backward consolidation comes in the backdrop of a bellicose Akhilesh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party banking heavily on coming together of Yadavs and Muslims to take on BJP in the assembly polls. As per the schedule, the inaugural session on Saturday will be addressed by UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh followed by announcement of political resolutions by party state vice-president Daya Shankar Singh, who also happens to be in charge of OBC affairs in the party. The first day, largely dedicated to discussions on OBC rights and their emancipation, will be attended by BJP’s national president OBC Morcha, K Laxman, recently inducted Union minister of state BL Verma, and party MP and national general secretary (OBC morcha), Sangam Lal Gupta. The concluding session of the meeting on Sunday will be addressed by chief minister Yogi Adityanath in presence of deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya and state general secretary (organisation) Sunil Bansal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjps-obc-wing-meeting-kicks-off-in-ayodhya-today/articleshow/86307186.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Dehradun||Cobra Lilies, which mark start and end of monsoon, disappearing from Mussoorie||MUSSOORIE: When the Cobra Lily flowers, shaped like the hood of its namesake reptile, complete with a forked-tongue-like part sticking out, start blooming in and around Mussoorie town, people know monsoon is here. When its time for monsoon to end, the flowers also disappear, giving way to fruits with red and green kernels resembling corn. Due to its unique shape and uncanny resemblance to a snake, the flowers are popular among both locals and tourists. However, due to erratic rainfall patterns and biotic pressure, the Cobra Lily, locally called “saap ka bhutta”, is becoming scarce. Cobra Lily has around 45 species, some even carnivorous, occurring throughout the world. Of these, five to six are found in Uttarakhand. The species found in the Himalayas is called “Arisaema consanguineum”, informed SK Singh, a retired Chief Conservator of Forests. “Some species of Cobra Lily are used to treat digestive and respiratory ailments. However, some of the species are poisonous. The plant’s tuber is preferred by bears and its kernels by birds,” Singh told TOI. The flower also finds mention in author Ruskin Bond’s “A Short Monsoon Diary”. In the entry on June 25, “the first cobra lily rears its head from the ferns” and on August 31, it says “The seeds of the cobra lily are turning red, signifying that the rains are coming to an end”. So, what is affecting the occurrence of these flowers in the hills? Experts say changing climate and biotic pressure are adversely affecting the habitat of these plants. “Cobra Lily was quite a common sight around the town a few decades ago but now its occurrence has reduced, owing to increased construction activities and random disposal of debris down hillslopes,” said Harish Sharma, a Mussoorie-based horticulture management consultant. Climate change and subsequent changes in temperature and rainfall patterns is also believed to have impacted the plant. “Cobra Lily is a shade loving plant and prefers moist places. Biotic pressure, coupled with climate-change-induced increase in temperature and changing rainfall patterns might also have impacted its habitat around Mussoorie,” believes Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/cobra-lilies-flowers-which-resemble-a-rearing-snake-and-herald-rains-disappearing-from-mussoorie/articleshow/86302399.cms||Anmol Jain

No new admissions would be made in these courses in this academic session. However, the institute has decided to start two new five-year integrated courses from this session. Last year, IPS had taken admission in 13 courses run by it. However, this year, applications have been invited for admission in 11 courses only. The main reason for the closure of the courses is that the interest of the students in the old courses has decreased or the course has been started under a new name. “Keeping in view the new education policy, the work of academic audit is going on at AU and under this, it was identified that there were some courses in IPS in which the interest of the students was almost negligible and there was a need to start some new and topically relevant courses. Due to this, four old courses have been closed and two new courses would be launched,” public relation officer of AU, Jaya Kapoor, told TOI on Friday. IPS has also decided that the name BVoc (bachelor’s in vocational courses) in Media Studies would now stand changed. The course would be now called BVoc in media productions. The process of online application for admission in these courses has also started. The courses in which applications for admission for academic session 2021-22 have not been invited by IPS include UG and PG courses of BVoc in Fashion Design and Technology, Diploma in Fashion Design, MSc Nutrition Science, MVoc in Fashion Design and Technology. Likewise, aspirants can take admission in the new academic session in courses including Bachelor of Computer Application (BCA), BVoc in Food Processing and Technology, BA in Media Studies, BVoc in Media Production, BA in Fashion Design and Technology, Master of Computer Application (MCA), MSc Food Applications are invited for admission to Technology, MVoc in Media Studies, PG Diploma in Computer Application (PDDCA), Five Year Integrated UG & PG Food Technology Programme, Five Year Integrated BCA-MCA Data Science Course, etc. Till last year, IPS had taken admission in courses like Bachelor of Computer Application (BCA), Master of Computer Application (MCA), PG Diploma in Computer Application (PDDCA), BVoc in Food Processing and Technology, BA in Media Studies, BVoc in Media Studies, etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/aus-ips-begins-two-new-5-year-integrated-courses/articleshow/86307191.cms||---

Ravindra Kumar said, “The complainant, who is from Banda district of UP, lodged a complaint at the Kotwali police station in Bareilly, saying the accused, Mahendra Pal, Rahul Sharma and Shubham Kumar, had duped him on the job pretext. A team was formed and the trio was nabbed.” The accused, who reside at Vasai village in the Shahi area of Bareilly, told the police that they managed to get in touch with a few applicants during military recruitment in Bareilly and took their contact numbers. Thereafter, they took money from a few aspirants on the pretext of getting them jobs in the Army.

---||Delhi||As protesters take over streets, central Delhi is worst hit||NEW DELHI: Traffic jams were reported from several parts of the city due to road closures because of a protest organised by farmers’ groups owing allegiance to Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD). Central Delhi was hit the worst. The protesters wanted to march from Gurudwara Rakab Ganj to Parliament, but police had not granted any permission for the event due to the pandemic. Several politicians and functionaries, including SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal, were detained by police, but let off later. Meanwhile, in other parts of the city, traffic was affected due to the bad condition of roads owing to potholes. In order to keep commuters updated about traffic movement, Delhi Traffic Police posted about road closures and suggested diversions to avoid inconvenience. The Jharoda Kalan border was closed for vehicular movement and commuters were advised to take alternate routes. Most of the calls regarding traffic jams came from New Delhi, Dhaula Kuan, ITO, Vikas Marg, Delhi Gate and Karol Bagh. Due to the demonstration call by farmers to assemble at Gurudwara Rakab Ganj, police had barricaded different areas and vehicles were only allowed after checking. Roads near Gurudwara Rakabganj, RML Hospital, GPO, Ashoka Road and Baba Kharak Singh Marg were affected due to the farmers’ movement. Senior police officers stated that Sardar Patel Marg till Dhaula Kuan was closed for traffic. “The traffic coming from Gurgaon to Sardar Patel Marg and from Narayana loop has been diverted towards Ring Road Moti Bagh. The traffic will remain heavy. Traffic going from Pusa roundabout towards Shankar Road has also been diverted towards Pusa Road,” traffic police tweeted. Many commuters took to Twitter to complain about heavy traffic on their route. People took around an hour to cover 4-6 kilometres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/as-protesters-take-over-streets-central-delhi-is-worst-hit/articleshow/86304830.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Second SIT to probe 2019 death of JNV girl||Lucknow: A special investigation team (SIT) was constituted on Friday — the second within a two-year span to probe the mystery death of a Class 11 girl, who was found hanging in the dormitory of Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya, Mainpuri, in September 2019. Initially passed off as suicide and then kept pending for months, UP Police were forced to re-investigate the case after Allahabad high court on Wednesday, hauled up the force and sought a conclusive report within a month. The court order followed a PIL filed by one Mahendra Singh, who alleged that a lax police were protecting the accused. Led by ADG Kanpur zone, Bhanu Bhaskar, the new SIT includes IG ATS, GK Goswamy, IG Kanpur, Mohit Agarwal, ASP Rakesh Yadav and DySP Kanpur Dehat, Tanu Upadhyay. Agarwal is the only officer to be retained from the 2019 investigation team, which had failed to file a closure report, despite conducting DNA profiling of 95 suspects and lie detector tests on 10 others. Those interrogated were the girl’s classmates, teachers and school staff. Interestingly, garments on the girl’s body had semen traces, but the earlier SIT had failed to match DNA with any of the suspects. The girl’s father had then accused school authorities of delay in informing him about the death, questioned the autopsy report and accused the warden and principal of complicity. The case was then handed over to Uttar Pradesh Special Task Force (UPSTF), but after the girl’s parents expressed dismay, the government sought a CBI investigation on September 27, 2019. Two months later, the incident assumed political overtones with Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi shooting off a missive to chief minister Yogi Adityanath, demanding justice for the family. On December 1, the state government swiftly removed then superintendent of police, Mainpuri, Ajay Shankar Rai, and ordered a departmental inquiry against him and a three-member special investigation team (SIT) was formed led by Kanpur IG Range, Mohit Agarwal. On Friday, the director general of police, Mukul Goel, held a joint meeting of officers of the current SIT and the 2019 investigation team.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/second-sit-to-probe-2019-death-of-jnv-girl/articleshow/86307242.cms||---

Born in the same ‘gotra’, the fear of being caught together always weighed heavy on their minds. On Thursday night, it all came to an abrupt end. Ashish Singh (25) and Bunty (22) were shot dead, allegedly by the woman’s relatives after they found them together. Bunty’s body was found in her home, on her bed. Ashish was found dead near the house in Naughava Narottam village. They were shot in the chest, from a close range. The woman’s family members were against their relationship. They had warned Bunty against talking to Ashish. The family of Ashish, which was also up against the affair, had got him married in 2019. But he left home soon after and started living in Noida. Ashish would often come to the village in Shahjahanpur in hope of meeting Bunty, a source said. On Thursday evening, on one such excursion, he again came to the village and didn’t go to meet his family. Next morning, his blood-stained body was found near Bunty’s home. Police have registered an FIR against the woman’s father, two brothers, village head and a distant relative under IPC section 302 (murder). Both the brothers are missing. Heavy police force has been deployed in the village as both the families belong to the same locality and there was a probability of violence as the relatives of both the families had started gathering. Later Ashish’s father Sukhpal alleged that his son was killed by Bunty’s father Krishnapal and four other relatives. Senior superintendent of police (SSP) S Anand told TOI, “We have recovered an empty cartridge and a bullet from Ashish’s pocket. But there was no pistol recovered near the body. We have registered an FIR on the complaint of Ashish’s father. The woman’s family members are claiming that her elder brothers are out of town for work for the last five days. We are probing the case from all angles.” Marriages within the same ‘gotra’ is discouraged in parts of northern India. Scores of such couples have been killed by their families in the western UP region in the last five years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/couple-from-same-gotra-shot-dead-over-affair-in-ups-shahjahanpur/articleshow/86302463.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

A case has been registered against the suspects under provisions of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. The suspects were in the custody of Bhamburda forest range till September 19, said a forest official. The forest and the WCCB officials had received a tip-off that three men have in their posession a leopard skin and are in the process of selling it. Rahul Patil, deputy conservator of forest, Pune division, said, “We laid a trap by sending decoy customers to the suspects and arrested them at Warje on Tuesday. We have recovered one leopard skin and seized a motorcycle.” He said, “During the trio’s interrogation, we learnt that five people were going to sell two more animal skins in Saswad in Purandar tehsil. We accordingly laid a trap on Wednesday and arrested all of them. We have recovered a leopard and a tiger skin from them.” None of the suspects has any criminal background. “The three suspects arrested from Warje had received the skin from the main suspect, who is missing now. While other five from Saswad told us that they had got the tiger skin from a man in Saswad.” “We cannot rule out the possibility of a big nexus of wildlife poachers and product smugglers. Our investigation is on,” added Patil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/eight-arrested-for-smuggling-skins-of-2-leopards-1-tiger/articleshow/86304825.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Deficient rainfall leaves Terai farmers in U’khand worried||Rudrapur: The Terai region in Uttarakhand has received deficient rainfall this monsoon, leaving the farming community worried. Farmers who began cultivation in June, hoping for good rains, are now worried about their crops and are fearing losses. Against a normal of 400 mm of rainfall each monsoon month, the region on average received only 308 mm of rain, registering a deficit of 23%. After June and the first two weeks of July, many places in this region did not receive heavy rain spells at all. In August, Udham Singh Nagar registered 170 mm rainfall against the normal of 200 mm. “In September, the region received only 170 mm of rainfall but delayed monsoon is expected to hit the region in the first week of October, compensating the deficit of September,” said RK Singh, the meteorologist at the GB Pant University in Pantnagar. However, Dr Singh added that if the rain spells are accompanied by strong winds then sugarcane and maize crops may incur losses to farmers. Harbhajan Singh, a farmer from the district's Bigwada village said farmers had been facing difficulty due to low rainfall. “The cultivation has been affected due to erratic rainfall. Farmers cultivating maize are losing hope of a good yield,” he said. Another farmer, Jawahar Lal Bathla, from Jafarpur village, said, “I have sown paddy crops in fifteen acres of land and due to the rain deficit, the expenses per acre have increased by 10% as I had to use diesel engines to pump water in the fields.” Meanwhile, Vidhi Upadhyay, zila krishi raksha adhikari (district agricultural protection officer), said that most of the farmers in the region have efficient sources of irrigation and rain deficit has been well compensated. “The marginal farmers may incur losses, nonetheless, the Kharif crop yield will be good in the area,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/deficient-rainfall-leaves-terai-farmers-in-ukhand-worried/articleshow/86302469.cms||Aakash Ahuja

The forest department has been scouring the Nrupatunga Betta and its surroundings for the past two days, but the personnel were unable to find any trace of the big cat till Friday evening. Residents of Rajnagar, Vishveshwarnagar, Unkal and surrounding localities continue to live in fear since the forest department is yet to find the leopard, or any trace of the big cat. Hubballi range forest officer (RFO) Sridhar Tegginmani, who is heading the search operation, said that the leopard was sighted near Kendriya Vidyalaya and the women’s hostel in Rajnagar after it strayed from Nrupatunga Betta. “We rushed to the spot where the big cat was spotted in the afternoon on Thursday, but could not find it,” Tegginmani told TOI. On Friday, meanwhile, residents of Unkal called the police control room to inform them about having spotted a leopard near the Timber Yard around 5.30am. “We rushed to the Timber Yard to look for the leopard but found no clues. We found no pug marks, but we have decided to continue the operation,” the RFO said. Tegginmani said that they went through footage from a closed circuit television camera installed near the Unkal Timber Yard. “From what we could see, it looks like a German Shepherd. But we are taking no chances, and not ignoring the complaints of the locals about the leopard. We are closely monitoring the situation, and keeping a close watch at all places where we suspect the leopard could be on the prowl,” Tegginmani added. Meanwhile, Nrupatunga Betta remained closed to the public on Friday as well. Residents of localities around Nrupatunga Betta were told to be wary and intimate the forest department should they spot the leopard. Tegginmani said that the foresters had set up trap cameras to track the big cat’s movements. “We will continue the search on Saturday. In the meanwhile, Nrupatunga Betta will remain closed to the public till the big cat is caught,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/search-for-leopard-continues-in-and-around-nrupatunga-betta/articleshow/86301764.cms||Basavaraj Kattimani

A trap has been laid to capture the leopard. The incident took place on Thursday night at the residence of Ramesh Tadvi in the village located in Limkheda taluka. Tadvi was not home and his wife was doing household chores when the baby boy Jayesh was on a cot in their house. The house did not have a door. “The leopard may have entered the house to look for other animals that are kept inside the houses in this area. The child was on a cot near the place where the animals were kept and the leopard may have taken it away,” said deputy conservator of forests R M Parmar. When the child went missing, the family and villagers started looking for it. It was on Friday that they found some clothes and other remains of the child in the forest and approached officials. Parmar said that no other incidents of attacks on humans by leopards have been reported in the area in the recent past. He added that a cage had been put up in the village to trap the leopard.

---||Nagpur||Woman gets sonography appointment past delivery date at Chandrapur GMCH||Chandrapur: A seven months pregnant woman was given a sonography date that was well past her delivery date, at Chandrapur Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) recently. On learning about the blunder, state secretary of women Congress Namrata Themaskar Acharya took the GMCH doctors to task and ensured immediate sonogprahy of the distressed woman. “The letter issued with the signature of the medical superintendent shows that the woman was given the date of January 3, next year for free ante natal care (ANC) sonography. How did the medics make such a mistake?” she said. Acharya said inquiry among patients at GMCH revealed that such blunders are common in the GMCH radiology department. She claimed that there are three full-time time radiologists in GMCH but only one is present at a time, while the private radiologists hired by the hospital “functions in an arbitrary manner”. She added that two radiologists Dr Mansoor Chini and Dr Navalkishor Rathi were hired by GMCH in the absence of a full-time radiologist in the hospital. However, Dr Chini, who is an on-call doctor, does not do any ANC sonography at GMCH. “Instead, the medics present there provide a slip with the medical superintendent’s signature, with a future date for free ANC sonography at his private hospital,” Acharya charged. She alleged that the other radiologist Dr Rathi is a full-timer, but never comes to GMCH before 5pm and “does not do ANC sonography” at all. “Pregnancy is a delicate matter and ultrasound scan is key to check the condition of the baby in the uterus. In such a situation, how can a pregnant woman be given a date for sonography after four months,” she asked. Acharya charged that helpless patients facing difficulties at every step have no option but to avail the costly private sonography option, despite the facility being available at GMCH. GMCH medical superintendent Dr Sonarkar said there is a need for four radiologists in GMCH, but they have got only one. Three others are private practitioners hired by the hospital. He added that the regulations in the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques Act do not allow the registered radiologist to do ANC sonography at more than two places. “Hence, our on-call doctor Chini carries out 8-10 sonographies per day for GMCH at his private hospital. As the number of ANC sonography patients at GMCH is much higher, they are given future dates as per progressing quota,” Sonarkar said. He further stated, “The medics providing the slips for the date of ultrasound scan, however, did not understand the medical situation of the patient and may have given a date that was post delivery.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/woman-gets-sonography-appointment-past-delivery-date-at-chandrapur-gmch/articleshow/86304897.cms||Mazhar Ali
---||Lucknow||Beware of DMs, EVMs in Uttar Pradesh polls: Akhilesh Yadav||LUCKNOW: Sounding caution for the UP assembly elections, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Friday said people should beware of EVMs and DMs (district magistrates) as both were misused by the government to influence the results in Bihar assembly elections earlier this year. Akhilesh said assembly elections this time will be for saving democracy and accused the BJP of adopting undemocratic means to influence the elections. “Uttar Pradesh ka chunav, bada chunav hai. Chunav mein EVM aur DM se sawdhan rehna hai. Bihar vidhan sabha chunav mein beimani EVM aur DM ke zariye hui (UP elections will be important elections. In the elections beware of EVMs and DMs. In Bihar assembly polls, EVMs and DMs influenced the results),” he said. Accusing the BJP of having failed to deliver on all fronts, Akhilesh said it will resort to spreading lies, misinformation and falsehood to cover up BJP governments’ failures. “After the BJP government came to power in UP, a grand Investors Summit was organised with pomp and show. Government had claimed that hundreds of MoUs have been signed pledging an investment of Rs 4,00,000 crore that would come to UP. It is now time for the government to come out with specific details of the investment it has received. The fact is that not a single big industry has come up in the state since the summit was held,” Akhilesh said at an event organised at the party headquarters on the occasion of Vishwakarma birth anniversary. Taking a jibe on the recent statement of PM Narendra Modi about the locks manufactured in Aligarh, Akhilesh said: “The PM talked about Aligarh locks but what he did not address was faulty policies and apathy of the BJP which saw small businesses and factories close down and were now lying “locked”. He reiterated SP’s demand of caste census and said it was necessary to decide a balance approach towards welfare schemes for different castes and communities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/beware-of-dms-evms-in-up-polls-akhilesh/articleshow/86307292.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

---||Meerut||UP ‘cybercrime capital’ with over 11,000 cases, Maharashtra has most cases of cyberstalking||MEERUT: With over 11,000 cases reported in 2020, Uttar Pradesh has replaced Karnataka as the state with the highest incidents of cybercrime, data from the latest National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) report has revealed. This comes even as Uttar Pradesh director general of police (DGP) Mukul Goel in a recent visit to Meerut had admitted that addressing cybercrime was becoming a challenge in the state. “Anyone, including our cops, are falling victim to it. At present, our staff is not adequately trained to tackle it,” the DGP had said. According to the NCRB report, Karnataka had recorded the highest cases of cybercrime with 12,020 incidents in 2019. This figure dipped to 10,741 cases in 2020. UP also recorded a marginal dip from 11,416 cases in 2019 to 11,097 cases in 2020 — the highest in the country. Nationally, the number of reported cybercrime cases has gone up from 44,735 to 50,035. The most common motive — in over 30,000 cases of cybercrime — was fraud. Other motives included anger, revenge, extortion, prank, sexual exploitation, terrorist activities, causing disrepute, etc. When it came to the types of cybercrime committed, most cases pertaining to 'cheating by impersonation' were registered in Karnataka — 6,486 cases out of country’s total of 11,172 in 2020 — while UP registered the highest number of cases under ‘violation of privacy’ and ‘transmission of sexually explicit act in electronic form’. UP also accounted for 85% of ransomware related crimes in the country. Out of 727 such registered crimes in the country, 618 were reported from UP alone. In cases of forgery as well, UP had the highest share. Out of 580 cases pertaining to forgery, 371 were registered in UP. UP ADG (law and order) Prashant Kumar told TOI that UP police is focusing on capacity development of their personnel to deal with cybercrime. "Over 10,000 policemen are being trained to equip them with technical know-how. We also have a dedicated force with in-depth knowledge of IT related crimes. We have cyber cells in every district, but they were unable to deal with increasing cases so we have also set up cyber help desks at every police station in the state." Telangana, meanwhile, recorded the maximum cases of online bank frauds while Bihar recorded most cases of debit/credit card fraud. Almost half of the one time password (OTP)-related frauds in the country were also registered in Telangana, according to the report. Maharashtra had the highest number of cases of cyberstalking and bullying of women at 398 followed by Andhra Pradesh (100). Nationwide, 563 cases were registered pertaining to 'fake news on social media’ with Telangana ranking first with 135 cases followed by UP (109) and Andhra Pradesh (106).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/up-cybercrime-capital-with-over-11k-cases-maha-has-most-cases-of-cyberstalking/articleshow/86302510.cms||Sandeep Rai

While savouring ganthiya, jalebi and locho on his way to the interactive session, the minister didn’t sweet-talk his way out of sticky issues, but displayed rare ability to tackling problems on the spot. The minister of commerce & industry, textiles, consumer affairs, food & public distribution, assured city industrialists that Surat Textile Park’s partial denotification issue will be addressed immediately in his ministry On a day’s visit to the city on Friday, he attended the event along with MOS for textile and railway, Darshana Jardosh. Tackling on a issue raised about 6 lakh sqm of STP, Goyal told the participants, “I was surprised at how a proposal has been on hold for four months. But as it has been brought to my knowledge we will study the matter by Wednesday and bring it to conclusion.” “We are ready to make the BIS standard for plastic products that are matching the international standards. So that manufacturer can benefit,” said Goyal. “The BIS standard in plastic products should be proposed and we will do it. We should not think of making second quality material. Some countries are dumping inferior quality products in India.” About issues related to non-release of bank guarantee and payment to third party, Goyal talked to the RBI deputy governor over phone and requested him to resolve the issue. “I discussed the issue with the RBI deputy governor. The official will reply after studying the issues,” said Goyal. Addressing Hallmarking concerns, Goyal said, “No actions will be taken against anyone in connection with Hallmarking.

We will further try to solve the issues,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/a-convergent-thinker-minister-leaves-sgcci-audience-awed/articleshow/86305215.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta
---||Nagpur||World Bamboo Day: Green Gold revolution in the making in Vidarbha||Nagpur: The Maharashtra government freed bamboo grown on private land in Vidarbha and Marathwada from transit pass (TP) in 2017, but there weren’t any takers for bamboo, also called the ‘Green Gold’ for a couple of years. In the last three years, however, over 5,800 beneficiaries across the state have grown bamboo on over 6,500 hectares and a revolution of sorts is in the offing with many more in Vidarbha going for bamboo cultivation apart from the conventional crops. Maharashtra Bamboo Development Board (MBDB) managing director M Srinivasa Rao says, “The board is providing seedlings and technical help to farmers through circle-level coordinators. Aurangabad has taken a lead with plantations in 600 hectares. In 2019-20, under the National Bamboo Mission (NBM), there were over 4,800 beneficiaries and under Atal Samruddhi Yojana over 1,000 benefited.” Many progressive farmers in Vidarbha are now coming forward to grow bamboo. There are shining examples like Ramesh Dumbhre, Umred, and youngsters like Gaurav Charde, Sanket Charde and Shriya Sutaone, Wardha. The youngsters quit their corporate jobs not only to contribute to nature but also help marginal farmers grow bamboo on their underutilized land. Charde and others have discovered new possibilities and recognized space for sustainable development in bamboo plantation after being guided by experts like Anand Fiske and Anand Kamde. The trio formed Wena Farmers Producer Company, which plays an important role in post-harvesting techniques, from nursery to bamboo cultivation, harvesting, industry and marketing. Started in June 2020, Wena works mostly in Wardha and Hinganghat. According to Charde, they have educated more than 100 farmers to cultivate bamboo on their vacant field. “Our main focus is on manufacturing essence sticks, bio-diesel and bamboo activated carbon. We have grown bamboo on 55 acres and plan to expand it to 400 acres. We will procure bamboo from these farmers for our unit,” says Charde. Dumbhre used to take conventional crops like chana, wheat and cotton, but since his farm is close to the river, the yield used to get damaged or washed away. “This forced me to think out of the box and after a lot of studies in 2018 I took a risk of planting bamboo on 17 acres and nilgiri on 3 acres,” says Dumbhre. He says it costs Rs70,000 to grow bamboo per acre “but it is a one-time investment”. “The species which I have grown will continue to give yield till 60-70 years. I will sell the produce to incense stick makers, paper and sawmills,” says Dumbhre and adds he also plans to start a unit. “I’m very optimistic about the bamboo sector and appeal farmers to go for it in a big way,” he says. Even Dr Vijay Ilorkar, senior scientist and head, Agro-Forestry Research Department, PDKV, who guided many farmers, admits that withdrawing TP was a turning point. “Vidarbha is heading for a bamboo revolution now. The conventional bamboo in forest grows up to 2 tonnes per hectare but in our research on 25-30 species, there is a yield between 12-50 tonnes per hectare. Bamboo has demand for fruit orchards, paper mills, fuel, furniture, handicrafts et al,” he says. “As a sustainable investment, a planned scientific and holistic approach to the cultivation and management of bamboo can be an inexhaustible source of goods and services, creating employment opportunities for farmers and workers in small and medium-scale enterprises. This can help to alleviate poverty and rejuvenation of rural economies and overall economic development of country,” says Neelam Chhiber, founder, Industree Foundation working in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Odisha. BRIGHT FUTURE * Bamboo is one of the fastest-growing plant in the world * Bamboo absorbs carbon dioxide and can generate up to 35% more oxygen than trees * It does not require chemicals, pesticides, fertilizers or water to grow * Bamboo improves soil quality * Known as the Chinese symbol for strength, bamboo represents growth and resilience * Government of India has created NBM to increase bamboo plantation and promote product development to suit market demand * India contributes only 2% of world’s bamboo supply. China, Vietnam, Thailand have the most percent of bamboo export * India has recently declared bamboo as ‘grass’ from ‘timber’. This means it can be grown for harvesting purposes * Bamboo matures for harvesting within 4-5 years after plantation as compared to softwood or hardwood which takes 30-80 years * Promoting bamboo plantation can help export products across the world and help overall economy of country||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/world-bamboo-day-green-gold-revolution-in-the-making-in-vidarbha/articleshow/86304946.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath hails PM Narendra Modi, distributes tool kits among 21,000 artisans||LUCKNOW: To mark Vishwakarma Shram Samman Diwas, chief minister Yogi Adityanath distributed tool kits among 21,000 artisans and said that the government would ensure that 75,000 artisans become self-reliant within three months. The CM also congratulated Prime Minister Narendra Modi on his 71st birthday and spoke about the work done by him for the development of the country. From September 17 to October 7, the day Modi completes 20 years in public service, the state government will celebrate ‘Vikas Utsav’ in which people will be linked with various welfare schemes. On Friday, the CM also disbursed loans worth Rs 171 crore among 11,000 beneficiaries under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana. “The MSME department must set a target to train 75,000 artisans and craftspersons over the next three months as part of Azaadi Ka Amrut Mahotsav. An action plan should be prepared so that the government can distribute tool kits among them soon,” the CM said. The Vishwakarma scheme was launched on December 26, 2018, with the aim of making artisans self-reliant. The scheme, said the CM, along with one district-one product (ODOP) programme of the state government, had created immense employment opportunities in the state. With a population of 24 crore, the CM said, the rate of unemployment in 2016 was more than 17%. Currently, it was 4-5%, he said. “During this pandemic, people had to struggle for work as lockdown was imposed. More than 40 lakh migrant workers returned to UP and it was a challenge for the state to ensure that they had jobs. Through schemes like ODOP, we managed to provide them with employment opportunities,” the CM said. He added that since December 2018, the government has trained over 68,400 people and provided tool kits worth about Rs 100 crore under the scheme. Another 1 lakh craftspersons had been linked with the government’s skilling scheme under which a training allowance of Rs 250 per day is given. Highlighting importance given by his government to artisans, the CM referred to the celebration of lighting lamps in Ayodhya on Diwali. He said that in 2017, around 51,000 lamps were lit in Ayodhya. “This year, we are going to light 7.5 lakh diyas. This has become possible because we have provided them environment to showcase their talent. Our artisans had stopped making Lakshmi Ganesh idols and we used to depend on China for these. Previous governments did not pay attention to this issue but now artisans are happy,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/yogi-hails-modi-distributes-tool-kits-among-21k-artisans/articleshow/86307352.cms||Neha Lalchandani

He said, under the leadership of PM, welfare and interests of the villages, poor, farmers, dalits, victims, exploited and deprived are on priority. Singh said, the motto of ‘Seva Hi Sangathan’ became the mantra of BJP only under PM’s guidance. He appealed to every party worker to take inspiration from Modi’s life while discharging duty in nation building. While Radha Mohan Singh reached Mathura, Bansal participated in various social service programmes in Meerut. Felicitating farmers and soldiers, Singh said, Modi was not just a PM but also a “social reformer” who takes up issues of public interest and solves them with people’s cooperation. He cited Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Beti Bacho Beti Padhao and Namami Gange as some of the key programmes undertaken by the Modi government. Meanwhile, party workers also gathered at UP BJP office and took a pledge to take up various social and environmental issues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/celebrations-by-bjp-on-pm-bday-cm-distributes-gifts-71-lamps-lit/articleshow/86307424.cms||---

Vijendra Rana was booked just days after he got the Gallantry award on this year’s Independence day. He has been accused of taking Rs 1lakh bribe from a junk dealer. Sources in the police department told TOI that the department is now planning to issue an arrest warrant against Rana, so that he can be brought to the police station for further investigation in the matter. The pre-arrest bail of Rana was rejected by the special court of anti-corruption headed by Justice Narendra Tomar. The government’s side was represented by the Additional District Government Counsel (ADGC-Criminal) who showed proof against Rana and requested the judge to refuse bail. “The accused’s lawyer cited health and other grounds to seek bail for him. The judge maintained that the offence of bribery on the cop on duty is too serious,” a senior police officer privy to the investigation said. SP City Vineet Bhatnagar said that Rana is absconding and police are trying to find him. “We are following the due procedure to get him in custody for further interrogation,” added SP City. TOI in its edition of September 2 had published how a fortnight of being awarded the prestigious state police gallantry medal for killing a dreaded gangster in an encounter, inspector Rana of Meerut Police was booked at his own police station under corruption charges. Rana has been booked for taking a bribe of Rs 1 lakh from a junk dealer to let him trash a stolen truck.

Civic chief Nitin Kapadnis has initiated the drive against the owners and operators of commercial establishments where unvaccinated staffers are working. Authorities claimed that the owners and operators of the establishments had got sufficient time since the start of the inoculation drive to get at least the first dose of the vaccine before carrying out business. Since the opening up of the markets, commercial establishments, such as shops, malls and complexes, are witnessing a huge rush of people. “Teams have been formed under senior civic officials to conduct sudden checks at the commercial establishments, primarily in the market areas. It is mandatory for the all commercial establishment staffers to get vaccinated and then operate. The staffers should also have their Covid vaccination certificates downloaded with them. To start with, we slapped a fine of Rs1,000 on one such shop owners as our team found one of the staffers working there was not vaccinated, not even with the first dose,” said Kapadnis. The authorities claimed that the action against the shop owners was a token start of the drive. Kapadnis said if the teams found unvaccinated staffers at the commercial establishments, stringent action would be taken and such facilities would be sealed. An official said the civic administration was leaving no stone unturned to get maximum people vaccinated every day. As part of the mega inoculation drive, the municipal corporation recently vaccinated 20,000 citizens in one day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/drive-in-sangli-to-spot-shop-staff-not-vaccinated-picks-up-pace/articleshow/86300649.cms||---

---||Nagpur||IT dept raids Anil Deshmukh’s premises, armed CRPF soldiers escort teams||Nagpur: After CBI and ED, the income tax (IT) department swooped down on former state home minister Anil Deshmukh’s premises in Nagpur, Pune and Mumbai on Friday. Teams of the investigation wing of the department raided the premises related to Deshmukh, including his bungalow at Civil Lines. The operations in Nagpur began between 10 and 11am, and covered a number of locations like the offices of Nagpur Institute of Technology (NIT) headed by Deshmukh, and places at his constituency Katol. Office premises and the home of his chartered accountant Kishore Dewani too were raided. One more chartered accountant of Ramdaspeth connected to Deshmukh was questioned, said sources. The team also went to flat no. 702 at the upmarket Rachana Galaxy Apartments at Shankar Nagar. This flat has been in the news in earlier cases related to Deshmukh including, the Adarsh flats scam investigations in 2011-12. Premises were searched in Pune and Mumbai in relation to the same case, said sources. Director (investigation) at Nagpur SS Parida, whose office coordinated Friday’s action by 130 officers from various cities, refused to comment since the search was still underway. There was no response from Anil Deshmukh’s office for an official comment, with no confirmation of his whereabouts. This is the first income tax raid after Covid. Parida took over as director investigation around a week ago. Dewani had been covered by the ED raid also. His statement was recorded by ED in relation to ownership of land worth Rs300 crore in Uran purchased from villagers in cash. It is alleged that the land deal was routed through a shell company — Premier Port Links Private Limited. Dewani is one of the directors in this company. The other director is Umesh Agrawal. In a departure from regular practice, the raiding party was escorted by Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel armed with automatic weapons. Sources, including tax practitioners and income tax insiders, said though police escort is used regularly, CRPF personnel are rarely seen in such actions. At Rachana Galaxy, one of locations covered in the raid, one of the security personnel held a 5.56 Insas rifle, where the transparent magazine showed it was loaded. Another held an assault rifle of Kalashnikov make. Sources said even otherwise armed policemen escort the party but security arrangements were rather unusual this time. The flat at no. 702 Rachana Galaxy covered in the raid is learnt to be owned by a person in Pune. Neighbours said no one lives here currently. A shell company allegedly used to fund the purchase of a flat at Adarsh Apartments in Colaba, Mumbai, was traced to this apartment. Later, it was found to be the address of Aroma Production Private Limited in a GST evasion case. The IT search follows filing of chargesheet by ED and the arrest of Deshmukh’s lawyer Anand Daga recently. A photographer working for Deshmukh’s educational and social organizations was also questioned during the raid, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/it-dept-raids-anil-deshmukhs-premises-armed-crpf-soldiers-escort-teams/articleshow/86305045.cms||Shishir Arya

---||Mumbai||Private hospitals account for 15% vaccinations in Maharashtra; Mumbai, Pune, Thane in lead||MUMBAI: Private sector in Maharashtra has administered 15% of the Covid-19 vaccine doses given so far. However, paid vaccination has been largely limited to three major urban districts— Mumbai, Pune and Thane— which together account for 85% of private immunization in the state. And within the private sector, stocks are skewed towards the bigger hospital chains with more buying power. As per BMC’s figures, private hospitals in Mumbai were in possession of 98lakh doses (65 lakh of Covishield and 33 lakh of Covaxin), as on September 14. HN Reliance Hospital in Charni Road held almost 70% of it, including 40lakh doses of Covishield and 29lakh doses of Covaxin, officials told TOI. Godrej Hospital in Vikhroli had 3 lakh doses, Jaslok and Nanavati had 2.5 lakh each, Apollo and Surya in SantaCruz had nearly 1lakh. Some 170-odd hospitals barely have stocks of a few thousand doses to less than a lakh. Of the seven crore vaccinations in Maharashtra, 1.03crore doses were administered in the private sector as on September 13. But almost two-thirds of the 36 districts didn’t see any paid vaccination. And among the ones that did, Mumbai (43lakh), Pune (27 lakh) and Thane (17 lakh) have the lion’s share. Among the rest, Raigad vaccinated 3.34 lakh, Aurangabad (2.41 lakh), Nagpur (1.46 lakh), Kolhapur (1.07 lakh). An official said districts that have achieved higher coverage had the advantage of private vaccination. Mumbai where at least 80% of the adult population is immunised with at least one dose had more than 43% of doses administered in the private sector. Districts with the lowest coverage like Nanded (30%), Hingoli (33%) and Nandurbar (36%) didn’t see any paid vaccination. Additional commissioner Suresh Kakani said the BMC has done 10 lakh vaccinations through CSR facilitated by private hospitals. HN Reliance has donated the maximum—five lakh doses, followed by Godrej and Jaslok with one lakh each. Surana too has given nearly 1lakh doses under CSR, while Cipla has donated 50,000. A Reliance spokesperson said the hospital has rolled out free vaccination for all employees and their families and “scaled up across the country” through free vaccination drives, adding the Mumbai stocks are reflective of overall procurement. Dr Ravi Duggal, a public health researcher, who is critical of the paid vaccination policy, said the government should have partnered with the private sector to administer doses without allowing them to buy stocks. “Vaccines available with private hospitals should be used under the public vaccination program with government reimbursing the cost of the vaccines. The demand for vaccines is increasing … so whatever is available with the private sector should be added to the public kitty,” he said. A hospital head, however, justified bulk purchases saying they have tie-ups with corporates to provide second doses and it makes sense to procure big volumes at a time. “It is also easier for manufacturers to deliver,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-pvt-hosps-account-for-15-vaccinations-in-state-mum-pune-thane-in-lead/articleshow/86305201.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Thane||Private hospitals account for 15% vaccinations in Maharashtra; Mumbai, Pune, Thane in lead||MUMBAI: Private sector in Maharashtra has administered 15% of the Covid-19 vaccine doses given so far. However, paid vaccination has been largely limited to three major urban districts— Mumbai, Pune and Thane— which together account for 85% of private immunization in the state. And within the private sector, stocks are skewed towards the bigger hospital chains with more buying power. As per BMC’s figures, private hospitals in Mumbai were in possession of 98lakh doses (65 lakh of Covishield and 33 lakh of Covaxin), as on September 14. HN Reliance Hospital in Charni Road held almost 70% of it, including 40lakh doses of Covishield and 29lakh doses of Covaxin, officials told TOI. Godrej Hospital in Vikhroli had 3 lakh doses, Jaslok and Nanavati had 2.5 lakh each, Apollo and Surya in SantaCruz had nearly 1lakh. Some 170-odd hospitals barely have stocks of a few thousand doses to less than a lakh. Of the seven crore vaccinations in Maharashtra, 1.03crore doses were administered in the private sector as on September 13. But almost two-thirds of the 36 districts didn’t see any paid vaccination.

Senior health officials said cleaning the nullah was important as there was a lot of grass inside it, which was leading to the breeding of mosquitoes. On this backdrop, a special earth-mover was deployed to remove the grass and dirt from the nullah. On Friday, CEO of the board Rahul Gajbhiye addressed a meeting of officials and employees of the health department instructing them to ensure there is no negligence in the work of keeping the area clean to avoid the spread of diseases like dengue and chikungunya. After taking stock of the complaints from the residents of Deolali Camp and the number of patients arriving at the cantonment board hospital, the CEO on early Friday morning called a meeting of the sanitation contractor, his officers and employees. He said no negligence in maintaining cleanliness of the cantonment area will be tolerated. He said cleanliness was very important for the health of the residents. A total of five supervisors have been appointed to overlook the cleanliness work done by the contractor in the cantonment area. All such supervisors should ensure the work assigned to the contractor is done properly in all the wards. The supervisors also have to report about the same to the health department from time to time. Health superintendent Aman Gupta and other officials of the board were also present at the meeting. After the meeting with the cleanliness workers, Gajbhiye visited the different wards of Deolali Camp and took a review of the cleanliness scenario from the citizens.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/deolali-cantt-board-takes-up-nullah-cleaning-work/articleshow/86300667.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Uttarakhand teachers get 6 months' pay after 5 years||DEHRADUN: The salaries of several of Uttarakhand’s 700 madrassa teachers, who had not been paid for the last five years, have finally been released by the central government but only for the period between October 2016 and March 2017 (six months). TOI had reported in February this year how these teachers, after having cleared Teacher Eligibility Tests (TET), getting BEd degrees and being trained under SPQEM (Scheme for Providing Quality Education in Madrassas), were forced to work as electricians and plumbers to make ends meet. SPQEM is meant to modernise education in madrassas and introduce subjects like English, Maths, Science and Social Science to students. Several teachers alleged that even though central government guidelines stipulate that salaries have to be directly credited to their account, they have been credited into the account of madrassa officials instead. “The central government’s guidelines say that the money of the SPQEM, which is a scheme under the union ministry of minority affairs, should be directly credited into the account of the beneficiary teachers. The government even recommends the state to use the PFMS (Public Financial Management System) for crediting the scheme’s money. Yet, the salaries are being sent to the madrassa managers. There have been many cases, especially in madrasas located in US Nagar and Haridwar where the manager has kept the entire amount or has deducted an amount as commission for transferring the salary to the teacher’s account,” said Ishran Ali, social science teacher in a Sahaspur-based madrassa. Uttarakhand has over 400 madrassas -- mostly located in plain districts. Of these, around 270 are enrolled in the SPQEM scheme. Majority of these are affiliated to the state madrassa board, while around 40 madrassas are affiliated to the state education department. The salary budget, amounting to over Rs 2 crore, which has been released for the period October 2016 to March 2017, is only for those SPQEM teachers who are teachingin the 200- odd madrasas that are affiliated with the Uttarakhand Madrasa Education Board (UMEB). Meanwhile, around 100 teachers working in madrassas affiliated to the state education department are yet to get any payment. When queried about the issue, director of the state minority department, Suresh Joshi said, “The central government’s guidelines state that the money should be sent into the accounts of the madrassa manager who will then forward it to the teachers. It is quite logical as well because it is only the manager who knows how many days a teacher has worked.” According to the scheme, a graduate teacher is entitled to Rs 6,000 while a B Ed degree holder is entitled to Rs 12,000 per month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/not-paid-for-5-yrs-madrassa-teachers-in-ukhand-finally-get-6-months-dues/articleshow/86302849.cms||Mohammad Anab

The woman, Nitu Singh Gill, was found hanging from the ceiling fan of her residential nursing hostel room with the help of a dupatta. “When other hostel inmates and the administrative staff did not get a response from her, they informed the Kolkata Leather Complex police station about the matter. Her family was informed about the incident,” said a police officer. Cops said that a suicide note had been recovered. “The note was addressed to her parents. The woman stated how much she loved them. It seems that the woman had been suffering from depression for some time. However, she did not want to blame anyone for her decision,” said DC (east) Gaurav Lal. Cops have ruled out work pressure as the reason behind the woman’s suicide. Her body has been sent for post-mortem. “We will speak to the woman’s relatives after they come to terms with the shock. The reasons that led her to take the drastic step seem to be very personal,” said a police officer. The woman’s colleagues said that she had been not talking much in the past two days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/28-yr-old-nurse-from-delhi-hangs-self-in-rajarhat-hostel-room/articleshow/86305070.cms||---

The administration, on the other hand, has assured to take intense measures to contain the spread of the disease in the district. Kunte on Friday conducted a meeting with officials from Nashik, Ahmednagar, Pune, Satara and Thane district to review the Covid situation. Collector of Nashik Suraj Mandhare pointed out that parameters in Nashik were quite good as far as Covid was concerned when compared to cases in the other districts. “We apprised the chief secretary about the presence of cases in Sinnar and Niphad talukas that border with Ahmednagar. We have said that we will closely monitor the villages that have more than three cases to ensure the spread is contained,” Mandhare said. The health authorities from Nashik said three talukas, Yeola, Sinnar and Niphad, are witnessing rise in new cases. The officials have been asked to pay close attention to rise in active cases especially given the fact that there was negative trend in most of the 15 talukas. “After meeting the chief secretary it has been decided to intensify the focus on containment zones in the villages. People jumping containment zones and home isolation conditions will be marked and sent to the Covid care centres or dedicated Covid health centres to ensure they do not spread the infection,” a senior officer from the health department said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/chief-secy-cautions-nashik-admin-against-rising-cases/articleshow/86300711.cms||Abhilash Botekar

This new work culture will catalyse efficiency and help in addressing problems like shortage of human resources,” he said while speaking at the third Confederation of Indian Industry (CII)-UP Health Summit. Admitting that there was a need to increase expenditure in health sector, he said UP was making efforts in the right direction. “The state is targeting establishment of a medical college in every district with mandatory rural posting for students for the next 3-5 years to meet the shortage of doctors in rural areas. This will pay dividends in the years to come,” the minister said. CEO, State Agency for Comprehensive Health and Integrated Services, Sangeeta Singh and managing director, UP Medical Supplies Corporation Ltd, Kanchan Verma, spoke about the role of private sector in improving healthcare access.

Pawar visited the Nashik civil hospital where a special diagnostic camp for children in age group of 0-17 has been organised. Speaking to the media, Dr Pawar said that there were reports about the minor girls being married off during the recent times and early pregnancy is affecting their health. “We are concerned with the lives of these minor girls, who have been married off early. I have come to know about several cases from the rural areas and hence, have asked the district health officials to provide the data of such instances,” she said. The reproductive system of minor girls is not developed sufficiently and hence, pregnancies at such young age are inadvisable. They could also lead to complications. If the mothers are weak, they could have weak babies. It could lead to malnourishment in the mother and the child. There are chances that early pregnancies could cause permanent damage to the health of these mothers. At times, these can even prove fatal for both the mother and the baby. “If we have to stop all this, it is important to get the idea of such cases and take corrective measures related to monitoring of health,” Dr Pawar said. “The law against child marriages is very clear. If there have been a large number of such marriages in the recent past, then there is a need to increase the intelligence gathering. Everyone has to take efforts to ensure the health of such minors is focused upon,” Dr Pawar added. After reviewing the data, the minister said that she would take this up on the larger scale across the state and take up the issue with the state government and even across the country as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/union-mos-seeks-data-on-pregnancy-in-minor-girls/articleshow/86300736.cms||Abhilash Botekar

However, the number of deaths related to Covid in the last week declined to seven as compared to 11 during the week prior to it. While the declining trend of active cases in Nashik city and 13 other talukas of rural areas continues, two talukas, Niphad and Sinnar, are witnessing rise in new cases. The number of active cases in these two talukas has doubled during the last week — from 58 to 156 in Niphad and from 188 to 254 in Sinnar. The district had 899 active cases a week ago that has now increased to 951. Nashik city had reported 386 active cases a week ago and now the number has gone down to 286, while in Nashik rural the number of cases rose from 487 last week to 641 this week. The rise in number of active cases is being attributed to the movement of people due to festivities. There area several villages that have been identified on the basis of number of active cases and the rural health department is carrying out active surveillance in these areas. “We have identified 14 villages where active surveillance is being carried out on the basis of that they have larger number of active cases. We are also carrying out active testing in these villages,” taluka health officer Dr Mohan Bachchhav said. The connection of higher cases in neighbouring district of Ahmednagar is one of the reasons for cases going up in Sinnar and Niphad. The health officials from Nashik Municipal Corporation have also sounded a note of caution due to rise in cases in these two talukas. “While Niphad is known for agriculture, Sinnar has industrial connection with Nashik and people not only travel to these places for trade and business, but also for the treatment ,” Dr Bapusaheb Nagargoje, medical superintendent of NMC, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/number-of-weekly-active-cases-rises-in-nashik-dist/articleshow/86300753.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Civic data reveals that while 16,396 tests were done in the week ending September 16, 413 or 2.5% tested positive as compared to 439 samples of 22,971 samples or 1.9% hit rate the previous week ending September 9. The weekly average ratio in Thane has seen a gradual rise from 1.7% on August 12 — a week after the city opened up after lockdown — to 1.9% in the subsequent week. The volume too swelled and touched 2% on September 2. Experts attributed the spike to non-compliance of Covid safety protocol during pre-festive shopping and social visits. Even as the volume of tests done and the number of positive patients are less than last week, the rise in positivity rate needs serious attention, said an expert.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/maharashtra-amid-festivity-thane-sees-a-spike-in-weekly-covid-cases/articleshow/86305256.cms||Manoj Badgeri

The police have since added impersonation charges in the case. Dilip Memane had approached the Loni Kalbhor police and lodged a complaint that Anil Bhote, one of the seven persons arrested, had called him to the office of a local news channel on September 14, where Bhote and his associates threatened to implicate him in a false case of flesh trade and demanded Rs5lakh. Since most part of the offence was carried out in the Hadapsar area, the matter was later transferred to the Hadapsar police for investigation. Senior inspector Balkrushna Kadam of the Hadapsar police said, “Bhote was initially taken into custody for questioning. He revealed the names of his six other associates involved in the case. We arrested all the six, including Rahul Harpale, who told us during interrogation that he had given two bogus ID cards of a ‘CBI officer’ to Maruti Nischit, a resident of Wadne Khurd in Shirur.

The case is very important for the state of Goa and also the public at large, and has wide ramifications on the law and conduct of rape,” he had said. In this appeal, the state has been represented by solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who is based in Delhi.

Adjudication is the legal process by which an appropriate FDA official reviews the evidence and allows full hearing to the offenders (erring shopowners) so as to come to a decision regarding imposing fine or penalty amount or punishment (cancellation or suspension of licence) under the relevant sections of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006. In view of the festival season, FDA officials have intensified surveillance to ensure that the owners of sweetmeat shops display the ‘best before date’ for loose sweets kept in trays/containers or jars for sale. Not abiding by the norm may attract a fine of up to Rs 1 lakh for mithai shopowners with an annual turnover of less than Rs 12 lakh and a fine of up to Rs 2 lakh for those with an annual turnover of Rs 12 lakh and above, the officials said. “Strict surveillance should be in place to ensure that there is no malpractice,” said health activist and medical practitioner Abhijit More.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/fda-action-against-11-sweetmeat-shops/articleshow/86305283.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Maurya has taken away some powers of registrar Charan and given to the financial comptroller of university Umed Singh. These powers, as reported, are given to the registrar by the JRRSU, Act 1998 and it cannot be given to the financial comptroller at all. According to the orders issued on Friday, powers of general administration, store, salary distribution – DDO power, academic director, conveyor for Pre Shastri Shiksha Shastri Test (PSSST) and Pre-Shiksha Acharya Test (PSAT) and four other powers of registrar have been given to finance comptroller. A source of the university said, “Two days back, offended by the tone of the V-C, registrar had told Maurya to behave herself as this is not the way to talk to an officer. The incident happened in a meeting in front of other members of the university. It is a reaction to this tussle that the powers were taken away from the registrar.” TOI tried to reach out to the VC but she remained unvailable. It is said, Maurya had some problem with earlier three registrars of the university as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/sanskrit-varsity-v-c-takes-away-some-powers-of-registrar/articleshow/86305292.cms||---

DCP (North) Paris Deshmukh said that police on Wednesday had detained a dummy candidate from an examination centre in Brahmpuri and registered an FIR number 555/21 under cheating (420), forgery (467) and criminal conspiracy (120B) of the IPC. “We arrested eight accused including one candidate, three proxy candidates, and four middlemen,” Deshmukh said, adding that investigation is underway to determine the role of other suspects in the racket. Police constituted a special team, led by additional DCP, Sumit Kumar Gupta to investigate the entire conspiracy. “Netram Meena (32) ran the entire racket through his aides. He is a school lecturer currently posted in Khandar Tehsil of Sawai Madhopur district,” Gupta said. Meena ran the cheating nexus with the help of his close aide and government teacher Bhanwar Lal (38), currently posted as a third-grade teacher in Meethra Khurd in Barmer district. Besides Meena and Bahanwar Lal, other accused were listed by police, are Kedar Prasad Meena (40), Bhabhuta Ram (28), Maha Dev (26), Puspendra Singh Meena, Hanuman Ram Bishnoi and Channa Ram. According to Gupta, Pushpendra Singh was one of the candidates while Mahadev, Hanuman Ram and Channa Ram were dummy candidates. “Netram Meena is a native of Karauli district and lured SI aspirants from Sawai Madhopur, Dholpur and Dausa districts. He would take original documents of candidates including Aadhar and permit cards and replace a candidate’s photo with the photo of a dummy candidate using computer software,” Gupta said. Preliminary investigation has revealed that the accused would take up to Rs 22 lakh from a candidate before sending a dummy candidate. Rs 5 lakh were given to dummy candidates, while Rs 5 lakh were handed over to middlemen and Rs 10 to 12 lakh were kept by Meena for himself. “The dummy candidates are students who have been preparing for multiple competitive exams. They were brought from Barmer district to write exams mimicking as real candidates,” Gupta said, adding that nearly 15 suspects are currently under the scanner for their alleged involvement in the cheating racket. Police teams were sent to different states for the investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/si-exam-racket-2-govt-teachers-among-8-held/articleshow/86305341.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Parents oppose, private schools for reopening||JAIPUR: Rajasthan government’s decision to reopen schools from Class 1 to 8 have received positive reactions from school authorities and negative from parents’ association. Classes 6 to 8 will be reopened in state from September 20 while classes 1 to 5 are scheduled to reopen from September 27. The private school owners have been demanding it for a long time. Recently, more than 2,500 private school owners gathered in front of Birla Auditorium demanding reopening of schools. Reacting to the news, Anil Sharma, president of School Shiksha Pariwar said, “It is a welcoming decision by the state government. We have been demanding it for a long time. Most students are not able to get online education for whom classroom teaching is the only option. Hence, this decision is in favor of the students.” Parents however, have completely opposed the decision. Parents have claimed that government should have decided to take this step looking at the present strength in schools. Sunil Yadav, president of Rajasthan Parents Forum said, “From classes 9 to 12, schools are already functioning but not more than 20% students are attending classroom teaching. From classes 1 to 6, sending children to school is a risk and we will not accept it. This will not be acceptable.” Some parents commented that government has taken this decision to appease the private school owners who are interested in this to get their fees. Already many cases have emerged in which parents have said that their children are being harassed in school for non-payment of fees. There are however, some parents who are in support of this decision. Dipti Shukla, resident of Raja Park, said that anyways her children are now going in every social event, marriage and public park to play. “There is no harm in sending children to school. If there is a problem, we will stop sending them. But for the last two years children have become addicted to electronic gadgets and going to school will help them socialise again.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/parents-oppose-pvt-schools-for-reopening/articleshow/86305315.cms||---

Guidelines have been issued to restrict groups residing in the same building/chawl from coming out for immersions at the same time, preventing ‘aarti’ from being performed at immersion sites, ensuring crowds are restricted during immersion, and children and senior citizens kept away. BMC has not allowed loudspeakers on the last day of immersions too. People have to wear masks, carry sanitisers and follow social distancing norms. The civic body has also arranged for 338 nirmalaya kalashs to dispose of flowers, followed by 182 mobile nirmalaya kalashs. BMC said it completed preparations at immersion points, including placement of 3,707 floodlights, 715 lifeguards, 144 first-aid centres, 39 ambulances, 116 searchlights, 48 observation towers and 36 motor boats. BMC deputy commissioner Harshad Kale said this year too BMC has constructed many artificial water bodies to disperse crowds for immersion, given Covid concerns. “Accordingly, artificial lakes have been constructed at 173 places. There are 73 natural immersion points where arrangements have been made. Do not take action that will lead to spread of coronavirus. Otherwise, such a person will be liable for action under Infectious Diseases Act, 1897, National Disaster Prevention Act, 2005,” BMC said. BMC also urged people to minimise use of garlands, immerse idols in a drum at home if possible as it is more environmentally-friendly or opt for the nearest immersion point, avoid processions or else a maximum of five persons during immersion. If possible, these people should have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19 and should have completed 15 days after taking the second dose, it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-keep-kids-elders-away-for-ganesh-visarjan-says-bmc/articleshow/86305379.cms||Richa Pinto

---||Hyderabad||Bandi Sanjay Kumar’s ‘will hang scholar’ remark creates controversy||HYDERABAD: BJP state chief and Karimnagar MP Bandi Sanjay Kumar created a flutter on Friday by claiming that they would ‘hang’ the scholar who advised CM K Chandrasekhar Rao against mentioning the sacrifices of warriors like Kumaram Bheem and Ramji Gond in their fight against Razakars. “Chief minister KCR once claimed that he was told by an intellectual that Telangana does not need to talk about old injuries and bloodshed. He should name the scholar and we would hang him,” Sanjay said, while addressing the public meeting in Nirmal in the presence of Union home minister Amit Shah. Sanjay courted trouble some time back when he said they would seize all the properties of the last Nizam and distribute them among the people of the state. He also said that some people had encroached upon the lands of ordinary people and publicised them as Nizam’s properties. He said students and future generations should be educated about the sacrifices and valiant fights against Razakars by Kumaram Bheem and Ramji Gond. “I wonder what will happen to this country if Narendra Modi and Amit Shah are not leading. If I get a chance, I will sacrifice my life for them,” he said. Sanjay further said: “During the height of Telangana statehood movement, KCR had threatened to topple then Congress government if it did not celebrate the Telangana Liberation Day officially. TRS representatives should now get ready to bring down the government for not officially commemorating September 17 as liberation day.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bandis-will-hang-scholar-remark-creates-controversy/articleshow/86305390.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

Both Nehru and Patel were Congress leaders but the BJP who has no freedom fighter to its credit uses Congress leaders’ names to derive political advantage,” Revanth said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/revanth-credits-cong-for-freedom/articleshow/86305425.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||Now, Gurugram-Delhi border hit by farmer protests||GURGAON: The Gurugram-Delhi border at Sirhaul, so far untouched by the farmers’ protest that began last November, was taken over on Thursday night by farmers wanting to march to Parliament. The blockade threw traffic on the Gurugram-Delhi lanes of the expressway out of gear all night and into early morning on Friday when the protesters were eventually persuaded to vacate the border after hectic night-long negotiations. Packed in buses, the farmers — owing allegiance to outfits backed by the Akali Dal in Punjab — started arriving at the Sirhaul border from 10pm on Thursday. Stopped by Delhi Police from going ahead, they occupied the expressway’s Gurugram-Delhi carriageway. According to police, the outfits had given a call to farmers to march to Parliament on the Prime Minister’s birthday on Friday. Hundreds of farmers from Punjab — protesting against the three new central agriculture laws — were headed for Delhi via Haryana when they were first stopped at Bahadurgarh. They took the KMP expressway to reach Delhi via Gurugram. Police teams led by DCP (traffic) Ravinder Singh Tomar, four ACPs and SHOs from various police stations were deployed at various points of the expressway to manage traffic when information about the farmers reaching Sirhaul reached the cops. Diversions were effected, and the farmers who had parked themselves on one side of the expressway blocked traffic on the Delhi-Gurugram lanes as well. The cops tried to keep traffic moving by clearing up a few middle lanes but with cars passing slowly and a huge tailback, traffic coming from the direction of Jaipur was diverted at Manesar to the KMP. Traffic from Gurugram headed towards Delhi was diverted through Kapashera, Aya Nagar and other routes. “We kept negotiating with the farmers so they don’t block traffic altogether. The protest led to chaos, but we managed to handle the situation. Yes, vehicles slowed down for some time, but there was no major snarl. By early morning, when the farmers had vacated the border, traffic movement had become normal,” said DCP (traffic) Tomar, adding traffic movement had also slowed down because Delhi Police were checking vehicles entering the capital. The Gurugram-Delhi border at Sirhaul is one of the busiest crossings in NCR and even a small disruption there can immediately lead to a snarl. Not just traffic between the two cities, vehicles headed to South Haryana and Rajasthan also take this route. Joginder Singh, a farmer from Punjab, said they wanted to hold a peaceful protest and did not mean to disrupt traffic. “We were not allowed to enter Delhi. Protest is our democratic right, but this government is not allowing us to do that even in a peaceful way,” said Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/ggn-del-border-blocked-overnight-by-farmers-cleared-after-talks/articleshow/86305430.cms||Bagish Jha
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Details of 6,000 orphaned children uploaded on portal||JAIPUR: Details of over 6,000 children who have been orphaned during the pandemic have been added to the government portal through various sources though the child commission is yet to verify the same as previously the verified list included 719 kids who either lost both or one parent to Covid. The officials claimed that there would be at least couple of thousands of children who have lost parents during the pandemic once the details have been confirmed. The commission is providing for the children who have lost single parent or have been abandoned by their families due to various reasons. Officials claimed that they will incorporate the government policies like Palanhar scheme and others to facilitate the process. “While the final number of orphaned children may not be as high as 6,000, there is a possibility that it may be between 2,000 to 3,000. Till now out of the verified orphaned children, at least a 100 have been given the benefits as declared by the government while the process is on to confirm the details of the ones uploaded on the portal”, said an official of the child panel. The state government had declared that it would look after children orphaned during the pandemic, irrespective of the fact if their parents died due to Covid or some other ailment. A few days ago, the central government also declared that children orphaned due to Covid will be looked after by them and launched the Bal Swaraj Portal where the states are to update the details of the children orphaned in their areas. After the initial figure of 719, the child panel had claimed that the children orphaned due to covid might increase in number as in the rural areas, there is still lack of awareness about the government aid along with the helpline numbers available to give the details of children who have either lost both or single parent during the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/details-of-6k-orphaned-kids-uploaded-on-portal/articleshow/86305399.cms||Yeshika Budhwar
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: More than 8 of 10 residents exposed to coronavirus, says survey||MUMBAI: More than eight out of 10 Mumbaikars have been exposed to the coronavirus, according to the fifth sero survey results released by BMC on Friday. The survey, conducted between August 8 and September 9, showed 86.6% of the 8,674 surveyed had antibodies to Covid-19. The percentage was higher (90.3%) among the vaccinated, who made up 65% of those surveyed. Among the 35% unvaccinated participants, 79.86% were exposed to the virus. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said, “The sero-prevalence amongst vaccinated people is much higher than among the unvaccinated, underlining the importance of vaccination.” Dr Daksha Shah, deputy executive health officer, BMC public health department, said the results should not breed complacency. “From the experiences in Israel and US, we know antibodies wane,’’ said Dr Shah. Globally, vaccines have prevented serious infections and ICU stays, but not given 100% protection against the virus to all. Sion Hospital head of microbiology, Dr Sujata Baweja who led the fifth survey, said she is herself an example of ‘breakthrough’ infection. “Most health workers like me are vaccinated, but I tested positive last week. My infection is mild perhaps because of the vaccination,” she said.  BMC’s press release on the fifth survey had a caveat saying IgG antibody levels of participants were measured which is not necessarily neutralizing antibodies that protect against SARS2 virus. However, the fifth survey for the first time showed the gap in seroprevalence between slums and non-slum pockets had been bridged. While 87.02% of those in slums had antibodies, the corresponding number was 86.22 % in non-slum areas. In previous surveys, slum residents with antibodies were double compared to building residents. Kakani said this showed a high number of those in buildings had got vaccinated. Concurring, Dr Seema Bansode, who heads preventive social medicine at Sion Hospital, said higher levels of vaccination in Mumbai had contributed to the 86.6% antibody levels. Gender-wise, 88% females had antibodies as compared to 85% of males. Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the state’s task force on Covid, said the survey covered 9,000 people for a population of 1 crore-plus. “We have to take the findings with caution. It represents a trend, but we don’t know what these antibodies mean and how soon they will decay,’’ he said. Congress MLA Amin Patel said survey results showed less vaccine hesitancy. “Also in high density areas, Covid cases are less and even if positive, patients do not need hospitalization,” he said. Kandivali MLA Yogesh Sagar said the sample size was too small to give a “correct picture.” The city is “mentally prepared” to face a third wave, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-more-than-8-of-10-residents-exposed-to-virus-says-survey/articleshow/86305437.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: In 14 districts, active cases below 50, 2nd wave ending, say experts||The active Covid-19 caseload is below 50 in at least 14 districts in Maharashtra and in single digits in seven of them, data from the public health department showed. “Active cases have started dropping significantly in these districts as Maharashtra begins nearing the end of the second wave,” state disease surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate told TOI. Districts like Nandurbar, Yavatmal, Washim (see box) had active cases in single digits. “As the incidence of Covid-19 and daily detections have reduced in these districts, active cases have fallen, too. Active cases are currently below 100 in many districts in Maharashtra, while the maximum active cases are concentrated only in eight to nine districts,” said Awate. He said though testing had reduced in some of these districts, it is only because the number of tests conducted is directly proportional to the number of new positive cases being detected and their contacts. The reduction in active cases in these districts was, thus, in no way the fallout of fewer tests, he said. “It is because the second wave is losing steam in these regions,” he said. “For instance, if a region has 10 new positive cases, all the contacts of these new cases are traced and tested for Covid. When there is a reduction in new positive cases, then naturally their contacts also reduce, causing a drop in daily tests. Therefore, there is an automatic dip of 10-20% in testing when new positive cases reduce. Also, there has been a marked drop in influenza-like illnesses or severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) cases in these districts, which is another reason for the drop in testing in some of these districts,” he said. Awate said the waning of the second wave was also visible from the positivity rate in Maharashtra. “According to WHO, with positivity rate being consistently under 5%, the outbreak can be considered to be under control. In the last three to four weeks, the state’s weekly positivity rate has been 2.5%-2.6%. The second wave may, thus, be nearing its end in Maharashtra, provided the coming weeks show a reduction in positivity rate in the six to seven districts of concern,” he said. State Covid-19 task force member Dr Shashank Joshi told TOI: “The state is now approaching a period when several districts may become Covid-free, which is a good sign. By looking at the active and new cases in 13-14 districts, it can be inferred that they are now almost free of the second wave. But they cannot be complacent, and these districts will have to ensure full vaccination of almost 80% of the population to keep another surge at bay.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/in-14-dists-active-cases-below-50-2nd-wave-ending-experts/articleshow/86305529.cms||Neha Madaan

Moreover, the department has also said that action needs to be taken by the operators against drivers who cancel rides and police verification needs to be ensured to check criminal background if any of the drivers. The guidelines stated that the online cab operators should increase the number of women drivers in their fleet. The guidelines further stated that training of the drivers should be done by the companies and in case of complaints by the passengers, the drivers should be removed from service. The companies will also have to give the fitness certificate of the cabs along with the insurance details and the drivers’ licences copies to the transport department. Apart from this flying squads will also conduct surprise checks of the cabs and in case any driver/operator is found to be flouting the rules, his licence can be revoked. The operators have been asked to not charge more than the rates set by the department. The officials will also take review meeting with Ola and Uber representatives every two months. According to officials, the cab services have an online system where most of the times, the customers do not give explicit reason for low rating to a driver due to the apprehension of being identified. Even the cab companies only take the registration details of the vehicles and the licence information of the driver. The officials claimed that they started to look into the verification of the drivers after an informal complaint came to their notice in which a woman was travelling with a child in a cab when the driver allegedly misbehaved with them. The licences for the drivers are issued by the RTOs and necessary action can be taken in case there are any instances of misdemeanour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/online-cab-cos-to-put-fare-list-on-app-rto/articleshow/86305450.cms||---

The Telangana Congress will launch a series of agitations and public meetings for the unemployed youth from October 2 to December 9, finally culminating into a ‘dharma yuddham’ public meeting at Parade Grounds in Secunderabad. The Dandoras, dharma yuddham and other agitational programmes are part of the final round of agitations to free Telangana from the ‘dictatorial rule’ of KCR family, Revanth said. He made the announcement at Gajwel, the home turf of CM KCR, where the valedictory of Dalita Girijana Atma Gaurava Dandora public meeting was held on Friday. He called upon students, youth and the unemployed, Dalits, tribals, Muslims and BCs in the state to seriously ponder over what have they got in the new state except for KCR’s family becoming super rich. “Youth, mainly the unemployed, 30 lakh of whom have registered their names with TSPSC should take up cudgels against the TRS government. Nine youth from each of the 34,708 polling booths in the state should dedicate their next 19 months to bring ‘Soniamma rajyam’ in Telangana,” Revanth said. He also appealed to the women to think how KCR government was promoting liquor for the sake of revenues. In 2014-15, the revenue from liquor sales was Rs 10,883 crore and now it has jumped to Rs 36,000 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/revanth-declares-2-month-long-fight-for-jobless-youth-from-october-2/articleshow/86305439.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Nagpur||Container shortage: Freight rates skyrocket, exports hit||Nagpur: Export and import of goods from Vidarbha have come down by over 30% for the last couple of months due to global shortage of containers, which has hit the EXIM trade all over the country. The monthly throughput at the three inland container depots (ICDs) in Nagpur has come down to 6,500 to 7,000 containers in the last two months as against the regular average of 8,000 to 7,500 containers, say sources in the industry. Indian Railways subsidiary — Container Corporation of India (Concor) — has a major share in the business here. The ICDs take the containers in rail wagons to ports. An official at Concor also admitted that the business, especially on the export side, has gone down by 30%, touching around 4,500 containers. Concor has an ICD in Mihan, while the other two private ICDs are at Borkhedi, over 35km from the city, and Wardha. The shortage of containers has led to a sharp increase in the shipping rates, which has affected small players in turn hitting the business on the whole. “Rice is the major commodity which is exported from Vidarbha. The commodity is taken to the ports in Mumbai or Vizag in container wagons. Rice exports from Vidarbha mainly head to Russia and West Africa,” said Shivkumar Rao, director of R&Y Logistics in the city. In over six months, the freight rates to Russia have jumped to $5,500 a container from $1,200. There has been similar hike for West Africa too. The freight charges to the US have seen the highest jump to nearly $13,000 as against over $2,000 six to eight months ago, said Rao. The industry is blaming it on shortage of containers and the massive increase in the freight rates due to it has thrown out small exporters. Due to container shortage, the shipping lines are largely taking the commodities in break bulk form. This is not affordable for many small exports as at least 5,000 tonne of break bulk needs to be shipped, said Rao. In the meantime, the government is making attempts to ease the availability of containers. The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) has issued directions to expedite the sales of unclaimed, uncleared or seized goods lying in containers at customs bonded areas (areas under customs control where goods cannot be moved in or out without permission). A recent communication by the CBIC says it has received a list of over 13,000 such long-standing containers from Container Shipping Lines Association. The field formations have been asked to expedite the disposal of goods so that these containers can be freed. Prior to this, 14,000 containers were released through clearing of goods inside. However, sources in the shipping business say it may make only a small contribution as the problem is much bigger.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/container-shortage-freight-rates-skyrocket-exports-hit/articleshow/86305459.cms||Shishir Arya

It will be another chapter to the glorious history of the Vijayanagara Empire. Aspects of all the six taluks constituting the new district will be celebrated as part of the event. Most importantly, the event will focus on the glory of the Vijayanagara Empire. The dais will be arranged to represent the halcyon days of the dynasty,” Singh said. Admitting to the need to follow Covid-19 protocol during the affair, the minister, however, pointed out that the creation of the new district marked the fulfilment of a longstanding dream of the locals. “The big question now is whether to allow the people to participate in the event or not to. We will instal giant LED screens at prominent places such as the Rotary Circle near the bus stand where people can watch the programme live,” Singh added. CM Bommai would officially unveil the district, the tourism minister. “The CM will also flag off work on various developmental projects.

But a primary teacher in Dahod district has landed in trouble after his photographs with newly inducted ministers Kuber Dindor and Nimisha Suthar went viral on social media. The photographs were posted along with a message highlighting his ‘irregular attendance since a decade’. The teacher at a village primary school in Fatepura taluka of Dahod district has been under the scanner for some time now. Complaints of his irregular attendance had been made to senior officials too. District primary education officer (DPEO) Mayur Parekh said that they had received a complaint regarding the teacher in July and it was being investigated. “Our officials have already visited the school and are gathering details,” he said. Sources said that many allege that the teacher is also running some other business during the school’s working hours. They added that he was an active BJP worker which explains his photographs with Dindor who is from Mahisagar district and Suthar who is from Panchmahal. The teacher’s wife is an active member of BJP and also holds the post of panchayat member too. Sources said that it was after making complaints at the local level that the parents approached the DPEO office. Parekh said that the school principal has already been warned that he should not make any concessions to the erring teacher. Parekh will be visiting the school next week to probe the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/irregular-attendance-puts-teacher-in-soup/articleshow/86305026.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Barring minor technical glitches for sometime during online registration, the vaccination drive was successful. Deputy commissioner Nitesh Patil and ZP CEO B Susheela flagged off the drive at JSS Sannidhi Hall.

The arrested people were identified as Thilagavathi, 48, wife of C Subramaniam of Moolai Veetu Thottam at East Arasur in Sulur, R Velayutha Moorthy, 28, of Avaniyapuram in Madurai, G Kamalkumar, 21 and V Prabhakaran, 19, of Thiruppuvanam taluk in Sivaganga district. According to police, 52-year-old Subramaniam, a moneylender, was in an intimate relationship with a woman in Virudhunagar district, much to Thilagavathi’s chagrin. “He used to give the woman money, but ignored Thilagavathi. Though she pleaded with him to end the affair, he refused. So, Thilagavathi decided to kill him,” a police officer said. Thilagavathi sought the help of Moorthy, a construction labourer who was a regular client of Subramaniam. “Moorthy agreed to kill the moneylender for Rs 50,000. After Thilagavathi gave him the money, Moorthy brought his relative Prabhakaran, a college student, to Coimbatore to carry out the killing. He also sought the help of his colleague Kamalkumar. On the night of September 3, the three-member gang attacked Subramaniam with sickles at a hotel on Thennampalayam – Annur Road. When Subramaniam collapsed in a pool of blood, the three fled from the place,” the officer added. The Sulur police rushed Subramaniam to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH), where he is recuperating from the injuries. Police initially suspected that the murder attempt was a fallout of a business enmity. But when Thilagavathi gave contradictory statements, they grilled her and she confessed to the crime.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/woman-hires-goons-to-murder-husband/articleshow/86305477.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Kolkata||Kolkata safest among metro cities for senior citizens: NCRB data||KOLKATA: There were 20 crimes against senior citizens in 2020 in Kolkata, a rise from 14 in 2019 but the lowest among 19 cities in India that have a population above 20 lakh, according to NCRB data. In comparison, Delhi witnessed 906 crimes against seniors, Mumbai reported 844 cases and Chennai 321 cases (Ghaziabad, Patna and Kanpur figures have been excluded by the NCRB). The city’s chargesheet rate (96.1) is also the country’s best followed closely by Indore (93.9) and Kochi (92.6). The pendency rate (41.2) is second best in the country behind Hyderabad (36.9). Kolkata Police claimed its various outreach programmes — particularly during the first wave of the pandemic when cops reached out to the residences of senior citizens stuck at home — have paid dividends. In all, the city witnessed four murders and two dacoities. In comparison, Delhi saw 15 murders and 58 robberies against senior citizens and Mumbai witnessed 12 murders and 29 robberies. “While the Pronam initiative — where senior citizens living alone in the city are enrolled with us — was a long-term success, the fact that we could reach the doorsteps of the 60-plus age group helped in confidence-building,” said an officer. The city had reported 14 cases of cheating in the first year of the pandemic in which senior citizens were the victims. This is a significant rise from last year. “Though the number is still miniscule compared to Delhi (80) or Bengaluru (49). The city police, this year, have decided to concentrate on massive awareness campaigns. This will include offline campaigns as senior citizens often are not accustomed to technology. Helplines will be launched for quick dissemination of information,” explained an officer. However, what will keep cops a bit worried was that the Covid ensured that court functioning was severely affected and not a single conviction was secured in cases where the victims were above 60-year old. There are as many as 111 cases pending in courts where the victims happened to be senior citizens. Also, cops could nab just four accused in the 20 odd cases registered last year. Overall, Bengal has reported 344 cases of crime against senior citizens, a drop from 2019 when 353 such cases were reported. At least 10 smaller states have reported better numbers. Among them, 12 cases were linked to murder and 19 of them were attempt to murder. Three cases involved rape and assault on women and 42 were linked to cheating and forgery. According to the SOP prepared by Lalbazar, beat officers have been asked to visit homes where the elderly live alone and take their phone numbers. Seniors are also being advised to CCTV cameras at home. Cops would help identify the spots where cameras can be installed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kol-safest-among-metro-cities-for-senior-citizens-ncrb-data/articleshow/86303248.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

SHO Rajesh Bafana said that the incident took place around 10am when Ankit Akoda was standing outside his house. One Bijju stepped out of a car with his other aides and attacked Ankit. Ankit resisted the goons and tried to move away in order to save himself when one of the accused fired at least a shot from an illegal firearm. Ankit screamed for help when his brother rushed out to see the commotion playing outside their house. Additional DCP, Ram Singh told TOI that Bijju’s entire gang has been identified and efforts are afoot to arrest the goons. “Both Bijju and Ankit have criminal pasts. Ankit was also booked in a loot case in which a chargesheet was submitted,” he said. Police said that the miscreants attacked Ankit with iron rods and sticks due to which he sustained some injuries. He was taken to the hospital where doctors discharged him after treatment. “Ankit claimed that he scurried indoors to give attackers a slip. He has alleged that the accused came determined to bump him off,” an official said. The firing triggered a wave of panic in Ganesh Vatika where several people rushed indoors. A police team was dispatched to the area soon after the control room was tipped-off about the incident. Police suspect that the accused had come in a small car which did not have any registration number on it. While the victim claimed that there were about five people in the car along with Bijju, police said besides the chief accused, no one else has been identified yet. A team of FSL and local police arrived at the spot to examine the place where bullets had hit. “We have tracked down the entire criminal network of the accused and his aides,” Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/goons-beat-up-man-outside-house-in-kardhani-fire-in-air/articleshow/86305555.cms||---

Even at the state level, the cases have been under 4,000 for the entire week. Senior officials said districts which have reported a drop in cases should continue aggressive testing.

Health minister Rajesh Tope said the cases in the state were plateauing and haven’t risen to a large extent despite the opening up, but the health machinery has been asked to be on alert, especially since it the festive season. “We are working towards vaccinating a large number of people, this will help delay a third wave or even bring down its severity,” said Tope. Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the state government’s Covid task force, said the surge in the city’s cases that began three weeks ago seems to have plateaued at the moment. “The next 10 days are crucial, and we need to maintain the 350-500 daily tally with aggressive testing and tracing to reduce the spread of cases,” he said. On Friday, Mumbai recorded 434 cases and three deaths. BMC officials said the daily test positivity rate which had increased during the first days of the Ganpati festival had dropped back to around 1%. “We are doing extra tests daily — 40,443 on Thursday — to check the high-risk contacts and neighbours of every positive patient at the earliest,” said an official. Even at the state level, the cases have been under 4,000 for the entire week. Senior officials said districts which have reported a drop in cases should continue aggressive testing. There are districts of concern like Pune and Ahmednagar and the focus has to be to ensure it doesn’t spread to the other districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-cases-plateauing-in-state-city-say-tope-task-force-doctor/articleshow/86305584.cms||---

The state became the first to completely vaccinate over 2 crore people. Also, in Mumbai, 1.27 lakh women got vaccinated at public/private sector vaccination centres on Friday, a record high for the city’s first women-only vaccination day. The state has an estimated adult population of 9.58 crore, of which 2,00,59,260 have got both doses and 3.17crore people got a single dose. With this, the state has given double shots to 21% of its population and a single dose to 33% people. It means that more than 54% of the state’s adult population has received at least one shot against coronavirus. The state has administered 7,18,85,574 vaccine doses, the second highest after UP. “Maharashtra became the first state to fully vaccinate more than 2 crore people,” said Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary (health). State officials said while UP has been leading the chart with most vaccinations, Maharashtra has been at the top for complete vaccinations. UP administered most doses (9.32 crore), but it fully vaccinated 1.61 crore people. Mumbai’s first women-only vaccination day saw an encouraging response as 1,27,351 women were vaccinated during the day. Civic officials said they are likely to plan another day next week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/in-maharashtra-feat-2-crore-fully-vaccinated-as-1-27l-get-jab-in-city-on-women-only-day/articleshow/86305640.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Std XI admissions: 64% seats vacant with just one more round to go||Nagpur: The city may be heading towards its worst performance in Std XI admissions through Common Admission Procedure (CAP), as 64% seats are still vacant with just one round of admissions left. Many academics say that it’s highly unlikely that the final round, officially called as Special Round, will be able to cover the deficit. Ravindra Fadnavis, a senior academic who has always questioned the futility of CAP in Nagpur, said, “This year a dubious record will be created as more than half the seats will remain vacant in the city. Even after the final round and consolidation of some seats, there is no way that they will be able to cover up more than 10 percentage points. So, approximately 50%-55% seats in Nagpur will have no takers this time.” He added that usually the vacant seat figures are usually around the 40% marks. Ashok Gavhankar, general secretary of Vidarbha Junior College Teachers Association, has been another vocal critic of CAP. Speaking to TOI earlier, Gavhankar said, “CAP or CET must be held when there are more candidates as compared to the seats on offer. So, it makes absolutely sense that admissions are given on merit basis. In Nagpur ever year we see 20,000 seats going vacant, and this year it might reach a record-breaking number, so what is the point of having CAP?” CAP is mandatory for all state board affiliated junior colleges located within city limits. The state education department conducts CAP online in a few urban centres like Mumbai, Pune etc. Since it’s a state government initiative, can Nagpur alone back out of CAP? Fadnavis says it is possible. “This year itself Aurangabad moved out of CAP’s ambit. The local colleges there lobbied with public representatives and then a presentation was made to the local education officials. They were able to convince those in Mantralaya and the official notification was issued. So, I believe that even in Nagpur we can implement the same,” said Fadnavis. Another academic, who did not wish to be identified, said, “The problem clearly is oversupply of seats in both rural and urban areas. Students are flocking to junior colleges located just outside of Nagpur city because of coaching class tie-ups, and hence the pressure on city colleges has reduced drastically.” Special Round of CAP starts on Saturday and will end on September 25. The education department in an offiical note has stated that “this may be the last round”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/std-xi-admissions-64-seats-vacant-with-just-one-more-round-to-go/articleshow/86305590.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

This decline, in turn, helped in bringing down the weekly Covid Case Fatality Rate (CFR) to 0.9% in Pune, which is among the lowest since April. Weekly CFR in the district has mostly been between 1-2% during the second wave, which began in early March this year . Dr Kapil Zirpe, member of the Pune Covid-19 task force and head of the neurotrauma unit of Ruby Hall Clinic, told TOI, “Overall, the number of Covid cases during the last few weeks has been the lowest in comparison to previous weekly cases since March. Also, a gradual increase in the number of partially and fully vaccinated individuals in Pune district could be ensuring that new patients getting infected have a milder disease. So, not only the number of cases is low, but those vaccinated against Covid are also gradually increasing in number.” He said vaccination played a major role in reducing the severity of the disease, with a chunk of the population taking both the doses. “There is also no delay in getting admission into hospitals or providing treatment to Covid patients nowadays, as fewer cases have ensured more health facilities to be available for treatment of such cases,” he said. The health department data showed that the district recorded weekly Covid mortalities in triple digits from March to June this year, which reduced to double digits since July. However, the number of weekly deaths since then hovered between 70-plus and 80-plus, except the last two weeks. A total of 68 deaths were recorded during the September 2-8 period, followed by 51 in the latest week. Citing one of the factors in falling mortalities, senior epidemiologist Amitav Banerjee said, “With any SARS-CoV-2 variant, Delta in case of the second wave, the impact starts reducing as the wave subsides, causing a drop in transmission and mortalities.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/weekly-covid-mortalities-hit-6-month-low-in-pune-district/articleshow/86305586.cms||Neha Madaan

Chidambaram is expected to review the steps taken to reconstitute the blocks and increase the active membership in every constituency. Soon after his arrival, the former union finance minister is expected to go into a huddle with the state election co-ordination, campaign, finance, manifesto and publicity committees at the Congress house. “He is coming to review the preparations. He is making the Congress workers accountable. We have been asked to finalise the names of the block committee members so that by next week the committees of the 19 blocks can be announced,” said a Congress block president. Chidambaram will meet all the Cumbarjua, Santa Cruz, Quepem and Vasco block members during his stay in Goa. The former union minister has made it clear that he does not want to be a part of any event where prominent members are inducted into the party. “He has some meetings with various civic society members and prominent locals. Chidambaram is more interested in meeting common people and random voters on his visits,” said a Congress functionary, adding, “Dinesh Gundu Rao is the one working on the nitty-gritty of things, meeting prominent leaders and others.” A review meeting of the North Goa block presidents was held on Friday at the Congress house where the recently appointed block presidents were asked to submit the names of the new block members by next week and identify around 200-300 active members in every block. The block presidents have to submit a weekly report on the active members and a daily report on the ongoing membership drive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/chidambaram-to-arrive-today-to-review-poll-preparation/articleshow/86305700.cms||---

Chilkur Balaji temple hereditary priest CS Rangarajan led a delegation to call on endowments ministe P Indrakaran Reddy here on Friday and demanded implementation of the GO. As per the Endowments Act, the priests were detached from their religious duty. The Act was amended in 2007, but it has not been implemented till now, he said. “The service rules for hereditary archakas are implemented in AP through GO No. 439 issued in 2019, but they have not been implemented in Telangana,” Rangarajan said. He said the old system should be continued to enable the hereditary priests to avail crop loans and natural calamity disaster benefits from the service inam lands. “By implementing the GO in Telangana, it will further strengthen the hands of hereditary priests to protect the service inam lands of the temples concerned,” said Rangarajan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/govt-must-implement-service-rules-for-hereditary-priests/articleshow/86305595.cms||---

The grooves were located at 1,000 ft from the river bed and 150 ft from the full reservoir level of Nagarjunasagar. It was spotted by Dr E. Sivanagireddy, Buddhist expert consultant for Buddhavanam project of TSTDC, and others during explorations as part of the five-day tour guide training organised by the Buddhavanam project. A good number of grooves were noticed on the slopes of the terraced hill down to the reservoir. “The grooves, which measure between 3cm and 5cm in diameter and 1cm in depth, were formed out of grinding granite or dolerite sling balls used to drive away birds and animals damaging crops,” said Sivanagireddy. He also identified a few Neolithic settlements such as rock shelters and natural caves opposite the site. According to him, the Neolithic site at Pavuralagutta might have been a production centre of tools such as celts, chisels and sling balls. “This find deserves further probing to know its potential. Pavuralagutta Neolithic site of the Nagarjunakonda valley with a chain of hills and a huge manmade lake has a lot of potential to be developed as an archaeological and ecotourism destination. It complements the Buddhavanam project already attracting a tourist influx on a regular basis,” said Sivanagireddy Among those who participated in the exploration included Buddhavanam OSD K Sudhan Reddy, R Nageswar Rao and Gosangi Saidulu, a local from Pavuralagutta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/neolithic-relics-from-4000-bc-found-in-nalgonda/articleshow/86305578.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

District revenue department officials have sent a proposal to the Commissionerate of Land Administration (CLA) office in Chennai to acquire the land. The land belongs to Bengaluru-based Dynamatic Technologies Limited. The firm had acquired a 12MW wind farm in Varapatti village at Sulur taluk in September 2008 from Tamil Nadu Petroproducts Limited. The farm comprises 48 windmills on 440 acres of freehold land. A revenue department official said, “Sipcot officials from Chennai have already inspected the land. We have sent a proposal to the CLA office recently for the land acquisition process and are awaiting the reply. Sipcot will take care of the land acquisition expenses.” M V Ramesh Babu, president, Coimbatore District Small Industries Association, told TOI that the private firm was ready to handover the land to Sipcot to set up the defence park. “If Sipcot brings two major players in the defence sector to the park, the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in the district would get a lot of job orders and it will create a lot of job opportunities.” He said MSME players were also ready to set up their units in the defence park. “Our members are manufacturing various components in the district for the defence sector.” Ramesh Babu said the industrial sectors were gradually recovering from the pandemic impact and the projects like the defence park would help spur the growth of MSMEs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/400-acres-identified-for-defence-park/articleshow/86305598.cms||A Subburaj
---||Pune||Shops to stay shut tomorrow in PMC & PCMC limits to avoid crowding: Maharashtra deputy CM||PUNE: Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Friday said all shops, excluding medical stores and those selling milk, groceries and vegetables, would remain shut on Sunday in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad civic limits for Ganesh immersion. The closure of shops would be applicable to the establishments in the cantonment limits also but not to the Pune rural areas, he said. Restaurants and hotels would remain open and the closure would not affect those covered under the essential services, Ajit Pawar said. The decision to keep the shops shut on Sunday was taken in consultation with all the elected representatives to ensure that there was no crowding on the immersion day. Guidelines were issued earlier to celebrate the Ganeshotsav in a low-key manner with several curbs in force amid the ongoing pandemic. Extra care was being taken for the city areas to ensure residents followed the government recommendations of having a muted celebration ahead of the possible third wave, said an official of the district. The Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal commissioners issued orders later in the evening, stating that only essential services would function on Sunday. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC)’s order issued by commissioner Vikram Kumar stated that all kinds of shops and malls would be closed on Sunday. All hotels, restaurants and food courts, except those in malls, would remain open. The PMC order stated that its directive would be applicable to Pune Cantonment Board and Khadki Cantonment Board. The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC)’s order issued by its commissioner Rajesh Patil was on the same lines. Both the orders stated that the previous directives would again be effective from Monday. After chairing the district’s weekly Covid review meeting, Ajit Pawar said the situation seemed to be under control at present and the current relaxations would continue. “If the situation remains under control, we shall take some important decisions after a review on October 2,” he told the reporters, adding that fully vaccinated sportspersons training for swimming would have access to pools now. The Pune district’s weekly positivity rate (WPR) was 3.9% this week. It was 3% in the PMC areas and 3.2% in the PCMC limits. The WPR in Pune rural was 4.6%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/shops-to-stay-shut-tomorrow-in-pmc-pcmc-limits-to-avoid-crowding/articleshow/86305634.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The decision was taken in view of the sharp decline in virus cases and the state nearing the target of providing at least one dose of vaccination to its entire eligible population. The success in conducting classes 9 to 12 from July 12 has also been a major factor behind the complete reopening of schools. The decision would mean around two crore people, including 1.80 crore students and 20 lakh teaching and non-teaching staff, would start attending schools. The government made physical classes optional for students and has asked schools to continue online classes for those who don’t want to attend offline classes. “The attendance will be optional for all classes and schools shall not pressurise any student to attend classes,” said the order. School canteens will remain closed and all objects that come into contact with teachers and students have to be sanitised daily. “Articles like chairs, railings, surfaces, door handles has to be sanitised every day,” the order said. The state has made it compulsory for teaching and non-teaching staff, including bus drivers and conductors, to take at least one dose of vaccination before starting their duties. “Schools have been directed to make proper sitting arrangements in classrooms following social distancing norms,” the rules said. Online learning will remain the preferred mode of education and should be encouraged by schools. A detailed standard operating procedure (SOP) will be released soon for schools. Meanwhile, in a major relief for families gearing up to conduct marriages, the state has relaxed norms by allowing 200 people to attend rituals and ceremonies. Event managers have been pressing for increasing the number from 100 to 200 so that ceremonies can be held properly as well as for generating employment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/upper-primary-classes-to-reopen-on-sept-20th-primary-27th-in-raj/articleshow/86305667.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata Municipal Corporation plans music museum at South End Park house in tribute to SD-RD duo||KOLKATA: Firhad Hakim, the chairman of the KMC board of administrators, recently met a member of the family that owns the heritage house in Kolkata that once belonged to SD Burman and RD Burman. If all goes well, the plan of building a museum on the premises of 36/1 South End Park might soon be a reality. Two meetings have already been held between the minister and the Kolkata-based current co-owner of the house — Nisheeth Kumar Totla. On Friday, Hakim told TOI: “The owners have agreed to sell the property. I have told him to give us an offer. Once that is done, we will discuss the offer at the board meeting. KMC also has fund issues but we will try our level best to buy this property. We will repair the building. The plan is to build a museum on the first floor. The ground floor will be used as a space for musicians to perform and have their share of adda.” At a ceremony held in January this year to rename South End Park as Sangeet Sarani, Hakim had said that the civic body will buy the building and convert it into a museum. According to Pancham’s uncle Abhijit Dasgupta, Dev Burmans had moved into the house from a rented property at Hindusthan Park where Pancham was born. “In 1945, my father and SD Burman had bought two adjacent plots of land. It took two years for the buildings with similar architectural styles to be completed,” Dasgupta said. The Dev Burmans lived in that house till 1952 before shifting to Mumbai. Some of Burman’s iconic songs were composed and sung by the duo here. In this house, the popular song — ‘Takdum takdum’ — was composed. For this song, Pancham had gone to the HMV studio in Dum Dum to do his first recording as a percussionist. There are countless stories of stalwarts like Ustad Allauddin Khan, Purna Das Baul, Salil Chowdhury, Hemanta Mukherjee and Asha Bhonsle frequenting this house. This house was finally bought by the Totla family in 1986. “We have always wanted to build a museum there to pay respect to the Burmans. I have personally taken the initiative and spoken to Nisheeth Kumar Totla about this. He comes from a very erudite family of lawyers. He has consulted with the other co-owners. They have agreed to sell the property and had discussions with Firhad Hakim. I was also present at one of these meetings,” said West Bengal Heritage Commission chairperson Suvaprasanna. When TOI got in touch with Totla, he confirmed about attending the meetings. “This is a family property. I have to take the consent of all the stakeholders. Shubha-da (Suvaprasanna) has told me that they want to build a museum there. No understanding has yet been reached,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmc-plans-music-museum-in-tribute-to-sd-rd-burman-father-son-duo/articleshow/86303337.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Delhi||Delhi: Failed in driving test? You will get video to fix it||NEW DELHI: Failed to clear the stringent driving test at an automated driving test track? Now, you will be able to know why and be better prepared the next time. Unlike conventional driving tests, automated test tracks simulate tougher driving conditions where the entire range of an applicant’s driving skills is tested. As a result, many find it difficult to clear the exacting test in the first attempt, despite being shown videos and tutorials. According to a source, come October, the transport department is going to start sending videos of the driving tests to applicants who failed their tests. They will also send a detailed test report to help applicants rectify their mistakes the next time. An official said a failed candidate would be sent the entire clip of his or her driving test. While earlier there were plans to hand them the clip in pen drives, the department now intends to send the video clips through messaging applications, like WhatsApp. He said the candidates who fail were usually unsure about their mistakes, but now, with the clips, they would be able to spot their mistakes. This, the department believes, will help them improve before they take the next test. “The department has been working on this technology for quite some time. The Covid-19 pandemic slowed down the plan, but it has been in the pipeline for long and is likely to become functional from next month,” he said. Apart from the clips, the department will also send a detailed report of the test to unsuccessful applicants, with information about how they fared on each parameter. There are also plans to provide better audio-visual demonstrations to applicants about the automated test tracks before they take the test. With the completion of work at Lado Sarai, Hari Nagar and Jharoda Kalan, Delhi will have 12 automated driving test tracks by next year. The transport department also plans to rope in another agency for maintenance and operations of these tracks. The centres will also get Electronic Queue Management Systems to ensure there is no crowding, and applicants will be taken to the track only when their turn comes. The department is also going to rope in a private agency for printing and despatch of driving licences and registration certificates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/failed-in-driving-test-you-will-get-video-to-fix-it/articleshow/86330085.cms||Sidharatha Roy

While the Met department has predicted light showers on Saturday, the rain could be moderate on Sunday as the circulation approaches the Odisha-Bengal coast. An alert has been sounded along the coastal districts of Bengal and Odisha that could be lashed by heavy rain from Saturday evening. Parts of Kolkata were drenched by sharp showers on Friday afternoon. The city recorded 41mm rain during the day. Around 2 lakh people have been evacuated from various parts of south Bengal, including East and West Midnapore and Hooghly. A flood-like situation is being apprehended in different parts of West Midnapore. West Midnapore district magistrate Rashmi Kamal said around 5.5 lakh have been affected. So far in West Midnapore, there have been 10 deaths, including three on Friday. The DM went for a spot visit to Pingla on a motorcycle. Debra MLA and minister Humayun Kabir also visited the local areas. In Hooghly, 26 families were rescued from Khanakul, as waters from Rupanarayan gushed into villages. “The circulation is now stationed over east-central Bay of Bengal and could move to northwest Bay over the next 48 hours. It will create a cloud convection that will enter south Bengal through the coastal areas. We expect a thick cloud cover this weekend. While the coasts could receive heavy showers, Kolkata and its adjoining districts may receive light rain on Saturday and moderate rain on Sunday,” said Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) director GK Das. A moderate spell lashed parts of south Kolkata, leading to waterlogging in areas like Golf Green, Lake Gardens, Jodhpur Park and Dhakuria.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/met-alert-for-coastal-areas-wet-weekend-in-city-on-radar/articleshow/86303376.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Portion of under-construction bridge collapses in BKC, 14 hurt||MUMBAI: Fourteen labourers had a miraculous escape but sustained injuries after a steel span of an under-construction bridge of the Santacruz-Chembur Link Road (SCLR) extension project collapsed at MTNL Junction at Bandra-Kurla Complex early on Friday. The Mumbai Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (MMRDA), which is constructing the 3.8km SCLR extension flyover connecting LBS Marg to Western Express Highway to decongest traffic on the busy stretch, has ordered an inquiry into the collapse that took place around 4.30am. Nearly 65% of the work on the Rs 415-crore flyover has been completed, said officials. “A three-member committee, comprising experts from IIT and VJTI , will conduct an inquiry and submit its report within 15 days,” metropolitan commissioner S V R Srinivas said. He added that the internal audits undertaken by the MMRDA, through its staff and third- party, will also be examined. The contractor for the J Kumar Infra Projects Ltd. In April, the 65m long and 8m wide two-lane span weighing 250 MT, was laid above the MMRDA grounds near BKC-MTNL junction, parallel to the path of Mithi river. It has a sharp curved design. “Prima facie it appears that there may have been some issue with the bearings,” said Srinivas. The bearings, fixed on the two opposite pillars above which the steel span is placed, take the load of the superstructures and substructure of the bridge. “The bridge tilted when work on pouring of concrete was in progress on the surface of the slab,” said Srinivas. Fortunately, there were no pedestrians as the area was barricaded. The 14 injured labourers were taken to V N Desai Hospital; their condition is stable, said doctors. They will be paid compensation as per the Labour Act, said officials. Later in the day, guardian minister for suburban Mumbai Aaditya Thackeray tweeted: “The MMRDA has instituted a 15 day inquiry and those responsible for the negligence or any other reason for this section collapse, will not be spared.” Work on the SCLR extension bridge had started in 2016 and was scheduled to be completed in 2019. However, absence of right of way and design issues as well as the Covid-induced lockdown had led to extension of deadline. The bridge is now scheduled to be opened for vehicular traffic in March 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-portion-of-under-construction-bridge-collapses-in-bkc-14-hurt/articleshow/86305723.cms||Manthank Mehta

In the note prepared by the party, to be sent to all the branch committees, it has been said that “efforts are being made to lure the youth into communalism and extremism.” Meanwhile, party sources said that the note had nothing to do with the controversial remark made by the Pala bishop. They said the note was prepared well before the bishop made such a remark. The party issued caution in the note titled ‘Minority Communalism’ prepared for its leaders in connection with the inaugural address at the branch and local committee conferences. “The activities of the Sangh Parivar have created insecurity among the minorities. Extremists are trying to infiltrate all Muslim organizations and create problems. The Jamaat-e-Islami, which works for the Islamic State, is also making a conscious effort to lure young people into communalism and extremist activities when it comes to spreading its ideological roots in the Muslim community and the general public,” it said. It also said that a small section of the Christian community, which is generally not subservient to communal ideologies, is also engaging in such activities and that there are conscious attempts to turn the Christian community against the Muslim community. The party has asked its cadres to be very careful on these developments and have a proper discussion in the party forums on how effectively the party can involve in ending such extremist activities. The party has also said that there is a move by certain extremist groups in the state supporting the Taliban government in Afghanistan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/terror-cpm-sees-bid-to-lure-women/articleshow/86303461.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Scrap farm laws, talk to farmers to find way forward, CM urges Centre||Chandigarh: Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Friday demanded immediate scrapping of the Centre’s new farm laws, calling for detailed discussions with farmers to find a way forward. Pointing out that many farmers had died in these protests, he said it was high time the Centre realised its blunder and withdrew the farm laws, which completed one year, in the interest of farmers and the nation. Capt Amarinder was speaking at the inauguration of the third state-level virtual Kisan Mela organised by Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana. The two-day mela is based on the theme ‘Karie parali di sambhal, dharti maa hove khushhal’, in line with the state government’s focus on eliminating stubble burning. The chief minister, who wore a ‘no farmers, no food’ badge, called for immediate revocation of the laws, which he said were detrimental to the interest not just of the agricultural community but the entire country. What was happening with the farmers today was extremely sad, given the immense contribution made by them to India’s development and progress, he said. “Till date, the Constitution of India has been amended as many as 127 times, so why can it not be amended once again to scrap the farm laws and resolve the imbroglio resulting from them? What is the problem in doing it a 128th time?” he demanded to know from the BJP-led central government. Recalling that he had been asked by the Centre to stop Punjab’s farmers from going to Delhi last November, Amarinder said he had refused point blank to do so, as protest is the democratic right of farmers. “Why should they not protest? How can I stop them?” he asked, making it clear that he continues to stand with the farmers in their fight against the draconian legislations, with his government continuing to give compensation and jobs to the families of the deceased farmers. Amarinder recalled that he had been attending Kisan Melas since 1970. He stressed on the importance of agriculture as the lifeline of Punjab, and urged farmers to take full advantage of PAU’s advancements in technologies and seeds among other things. He underlined the importance of continued research to keep pace with the developments in agriculture the world over. Citing Israel’s success in use of drip irrigation for judicious use of the fast-depleting water table, the chief minister said Punjab’s ground water level had been continuously going down. The state’s diversification programme was linked to ensure minimal use of water, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/scrap-farm-laws-talk-to-farmers-to-find-way-forward-cm-urges-centre/articleshow/86305719.cms||---

The woman and her mother lodged a complaint with the Rajwada police against the man. The bullet missed the woman by a whisker. She was, however, injured as she collapsed while trying to get out of the way of the air gun. Inspector Pramod Jadhav from the Rajwada police station said, “The woman and her mother approached us after the incident.” The police said the man was arrested under Section 307 of the IPC. The police recovered the air gun and six bullets from him. According to the complaint, the man’s wife had suspected that he was in a relationship with the woman. The man had taken his wife to meet the woman to clear the doubt. “The woman had come with her mother to meet the couple. On seeing them, the man’s wife threatened to jump into the lake.

---||Chandigarh||Haryana cops deny Karnal lathicharge happened on former SDM’s direction||CHANDIGARH: Defending former Karnal sub-divisional magistrate Ayush Sinha, who was purportedly seen in a video instructing police officials to hit protesters on their head, the Haryana police on Friday completely denied acting on Sinha’s directions during the August 28 protest by farmers in Karnal. “It is wrong to state that police officials attacked protesters on head, nose, forehead and other vital parts of the body under the directions of Ayush Sinha, IAS, SDM. … As far as contents of the CD relating to the briefing of SDM is concerned, it is submitted that the briefing of the force took place at a place 13 km away from the Bastara toll and this briefing has no contextual relation with the incident taking place at Bastara toll nor the officials briefed by the SDM were part of the force deployed at Bastara toll,” claimed Mamta Singh, IGP (Karnal range), in a detailed reply submitted to the Punjab and Haryana high court. The reply filed in an affidavit has been submitted in reply to a petition filed by some persons who were injured during the August 28 incident and moved the HC seeking a judicial probe of the incident. According to the state’s reply, the move of the petitioners to put all efforts to project that under the guidance and directions of SDM Ayush Sinha the police force had assaulted vital parts was an attempt to divert the attention of the court from their unlawful act of sealing the national highway that had caused harassment and trauma to hundreds and thousands of passengers stranded on the road, under the threat and fear of physical harm as well as damage to their property. The police also claimed that the person, whose photographs are being circulated in social media as a victim of the police brutality in Karnal, was in fact attacking the police by ‘kassi’ (a small shovel) and fell down during his own illegal action and sustained injuries. According to the police, the farmers “stick to their character of not performing their commitment” and the call of blockade which was to be concluded by 5 pm was extended and finally, the road blockade was lifted by 7 pm across the state, including the Bastara toll. “Thus, for three hours the whole Haryana state was at a standstill with no possibility of any movement on road by any person even in emergent need. Thousands of vehicles left were stuck up in the jam, living occupants of those vehicles complaining and expressing their anger not only against the local administration but the agitating farmers,” the state claimed. Regarding the death of a farmer, Sushil Kajal, due to cardiac arrest after injuries, the police claimed that there are 28 medico-legal reports (MLRs) but there is no MLR of Sushil Kajal resident of Raipur Jatan, who reportedly died due to a heart attack. It has also been claimed that there was no complaint or any such allegation by the family members till cremation was over. “Further, the family didn't even approach for any post-mortem examination nor are there any photographs/visuals of the deceased having injury on the body shared with the police or elsewhere as per information available. However on August 31, one complaint in this regard has been received and the same is under investigation,” claimed the police. In its detailed reply, the police also claimed that since November 2020, the state police is facing serious law and order challenges in view of blanket calls given by various farmers unions to protest any public/political program by the state government and there have been incidents in past where police have faced challenges in ensuring safety and security of the elected representatives while respecting the sentiments of agitating farmers. It has also been stated that in the last nine months there have been large instances of road blockades across Haryana crippling public life on roads and taking the government and whole system at ransom.  There have been 211 FIRs registered so far in matters related to farmer agitation and the majority of them are related to the road blockade. The state police have specifically mentioned the incidents of Kaimla, Hisar and Karnal, where the farmers had protested against chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar’s visit on several occasions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/haryana-cops-deny-karnal-lathicharge-happened-on-former-sdms-direction/articleshow/86305753.cms||Ajay Sura
---||Pune||Stung by dengue, Pune civic body wakes up to draft bylaws for mosquito control||PUNE: The rise in dengue cases in the city has woken up the Pune Municipal Corporation to the need of legal backing against mosquito breeding, for which the authorities have sought the state government’s approval for the draft bylaws submitted in January 2018. The bylaws, once approved, will give civic officials legal power to enforce stringent measures to control mosquito breeding by way of levying hefty fines and even filing criminal cases, if required. The lax and indifferent approach of some of the citizens, housing societies and commercial establishments to mosquito breeding on their premises led to the formation of the bylaws in 2013. It took the administration next five years to steer it through various civic panels before submitting them to the state government for clearance in 2018. “We made all the changes in the draft bylaws the state’s urban development department (UDD) had asked for in September 2019. The Covid pandemic put it on the backburner. We have started following-up on it now for speedy approval,” said Sanjeev Wavre, head of the PMC’s insect control department. Section 458 of the Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act allows the civic bodies to frame bylaws in the larger interest of citizens. The bylaws state that an individual or institution should employ remedial measures if they see stagnant water on their premises. The norms also direct individuals and institutions to take measures to eradicate mosquito-breeding sites on their premises. If they fail to comply, civic officials will carry out necessary measures, for which the user of the premises will have to reimburse the civic body for the expenses involved,” he added. Activists in the city, however, slammed PMC officials for the inefficiency to get the laws enforced since 2013. “It has been eight years now that the bylaws were framed, but officials could not put them into force. This shows how slowly things move when there are no purchases and tenders involved,” said activist Abhijit More. TOI has been writing about the need for bylaws in Pune city, considering the outbreaks of dengue and chikungunya in the last few years. Despite repeated attempts, Bhushan Gagrani, principal secretary, UDD, could not be contacted for his comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/stung-by-dengue-civic-body-wakes-up-to-draft-bylaws-for-mosquito-control/articleshow/86305749.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Mumbai||CA introduced ex-min to hawala operators who helped rotate bribes: ED||MUMBAI: The Enforcement Directorate, probing former state home minister Anil Deshmukh’s suspicious financial transactions spanning over the past decade in the money laundering case, has found he had legitimised Rs 9.8 crore tainted money through 18 Kolkata-based shell companies when he was minister in the Congress-led government in Maharashtra. The ED also said Deshmukh was taking the help of Delhi hawala operators, accused brothers Surendra Kumar Jain and Virendra Jain, from 2013 for layering tainted money. A CA has told the ED he had introduced the Jains to Deshmukh’s son Hrishikesh “who wanted a person who would give donation to the family-owned Shri Sai Sikshan Sanasthan” in lieu of cash. Jain brothers were sent cash and they returned it as donations: EDA CA has told ED he had introduced the Jain hawala operator brothers to Anil Deshmukh’s son Hrishikesh “who wanted a person who would give donation to the family-owned Shri Sai Sikshan Sanasthan” in lieu of cash. The CA said he acted as guarantor and coordinator. Between 2013 and March 2021, a total of over Rs 4.03 crore was passed on to Deshmukh’s trust in the garb of donations, ED said. The brothers helped Deshmukh layer the money illegally collected from bar owners by police officer Sachin Waze.ED said Deshmukh’s family, with the help of close associates, was managing various companies and laundering money. by creating a complex web of transactions. In the chargesheet ED filed against the Deshmukh-controlled trust and his two former staffers, it said the Deshmukhcontrolled company Zodiac Dealcom Private Ltd had raised Rs.9.82 crore through bogus share capital from 18 Kolkata shell companies around a decade ago. Part of the funds were used to establish warehousing business in two companies, Rabia Logistics Pvt Ltd and Blackstone Logistics Pvt Ltd. The ED stated that later, fund generated from the warehousing business was routed through a number of companies owned by the family. The CA said the brothers used to charge a commission of 1%. The witness said “upon receiving cash they used to provide donations through their companies Reliable Finance Corpn Pvt Ltd, Utsav Securities Pvt Ltd and VA Realcon Pvt Ltd”. The alleged “paper companies” are also named as accused. “Hrishikesh Deshmukh used to convey to me the amount of donation, which I further used to convey to Virendra and Surendra Jain. Further, I state that cash was transferred to Delhi through hawala operations which used to be looked after by Hrishikesh Deshmukh only,” the witness said. Asked for the source of the cash transferred, he replied Hrishikesh would be in a better position to explain it. Also part of the chargesheet are statements of the Jain brothers. They said they had known the CA since 1997. Surendra Jain said in 2013, the CA told him the trust required credit entries. “(The CA) guided me that he will send certain money (sic) to my companies and I have to transfer the money to Shri Sai Shikshan Sanstha after rotating them in my companies. Before sending any money… he used to inform me on the phone. Once the amount would be credited in the accounts of my companies from various creditors and debtors of my companies, the same was transferred to Shri Sai Shikshan Sanstha and accordingly the information was passed on to him,” the witness said. He added that during the last 8-9 years, he transferred around Rs 4 crore to the trust after getting the money. The chargesheet has Waze’s statement. He said Deshmukh used to call him to his office, residence and state guest house and give directions. He said he got direct instructions in the TRP case, Arnab Goswami’s arrest in an abetment to suicide case. “In the TRP case, Anil Deshmukh wanted to arrest Goswami,” Waze said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/jain-brothers-were-sent-cash-and-they-returned-it-as-donations-ed/articleshow/86305756.cms||Vijay V Singh

Entry to Mahadwar road, which is the main route for the immersion procession, has been prohibited. Ganesh pandals have been asked to take alternative routes to reach Irani quarry.

Traffic at the immersion route will be diverted and police personnel will be deployed to prevent crowding. More than 3,000 police personnel will be deployed in the district to ensure the immersion process is conducted peacefully. Superintendent of Kolhapur police Shailesh Balkawade said, “Last year, restrictions were imposed while carrying out immersion and the same will be extended this year.

---||Hyderabad||What’s in celebration name, Hyderabad embraced India on September 17||HYDERABAD: It is that time of the year when most political conversations end in a debate on the significance of September 17, when the princely state of Hyderabad formally joined the Indian Union in 1948. Political parties of all hues agree on the significance of September 17, but disagree on the nomenclature. For some it is ‘Liberation Day’, while for others it is ‘Merger Day’, ‘Integration Day’ or ‘Unification Day’. When India became Independent in 1947, two princely states — Hyderabad and Kashmir — presented unique challenges for the then home minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s grand project of unifying over 500 princely states. Kashmir was ruled by a Hindu king, but majority of its subjects were Muslim. On the other hand, Hyderabad was ruled by a Muslim king and its subjects were predominantly Hindu. The proponents of ‘Liberation Day’ claim Hyderabad was “liberated from the Nizam’s tyrannical rule” on September 17, 1948. Barring BJP, no other party agrees to this narrative. Congress, Left parties and TRS keep their celebrations low profile with flag hoisting and speeches. But BJP wants the Telangana government to officially celebrate September 17 as ‘Liberation Day’, just as the Nizam’s former dominions in Karnataka (Hyderabad-Karnataka) and Maharashtra (Marathwada) observe it now. It wants to propound the myth that Razakars — a private militia allegedly propped up by the Nizam — targeted only Hindus. Though most victims were from the majority community, there were many Hindu feudal lords among the ranks of Razakars, who wanted to protect their fiefdoms. TRS has accused the saffron party of “divisive politics” and a move to communalise Hyderabad by proposing mega celebrations on September 17. On the other hand, BJP claims the pink party is playing vote-bank politics to appease certain sections. Earlier, TRS was gung-ho about celebrating September 17 as ‘Liberation Day’, but the churning during statehood movement forced it to change its stand to appear more inclusive. Now, it has resigned to the fact that September 17 should be observed as ‘Merger Day’. India’s first home minister Patel reposed faith in Nizam VII Mir Osman Ali Khan after annexation of Hyderabad and gave the last ruler of Hyderabad his due. But present home minister Amit Shah is aiming to send the political temperature a few notches up with his public meet at Veyi Udala Marri in Nirmal. The purpose of the meeting is to “inspire people of the state”. The venue, Veyi Udala Marri, was carefully chosen as Razakars reportedly killed at least a 1,000 people under the banyan tree. Much water has gone down the Musi since 1948, and whatever be the name, the only irrefutable fact is that Hyderabad State became a part of India on September 17.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/whats-in-celebration-name-hyd-embraced-india-on-sept-17/articleshow/86305769.cms||Dinesh Kumar
---||Mysuru||Mysuru MP Pratap Simha questions Sidddaramaiah’s newfound love for Hindus||MYSURU: Responding to former CM Siddaramaiah’s remarks condemning the BJP government for the demolition drive against temples, Mysuru MP Pratap Simha on Friday questioned the Congress leader’s new-found love for Hindus.  “Where was this same spirit for Hindus when he sanctioned Tipu Jayanti celebrations. Tipu Sultan was a Muslim ruler who was opposed to Hindus, and destroyed temples,” Simha said. Simha also criticised Siddaramaiah for trying to divide the Hindu community by supporting the campaign seeking religious status for the Lingayat community. “During his tenure as CM, Siddaramaiah made little effort to prevent the demolition of temples. On February 6, 2018, the Supreme Court, issuing its final order, issued clear directions to all state governments on vacating temples in public places and roads. The court had directed the government to submit a report on the action taken in this regard. But the Siddaramaiah-led government failed to submit its report or any affidavit to the apex court,” Simha added. In July, chief secretary P Ravi Kumar directed the deputy commissioner of all districts to raze unauthorised religious structures in public places. “The demolition drive was undertaken in accordance with the directions issued by the chief secretary,” the MP said. However, he added that the officials in the Mysuru district administration had not read the Supreme Court order properly, and were targeting temples selectively. “The Supreme Court issued directions that only structures built in public places after 2009. The apex court said that only those structures should be demolished only if relocation or regularisation was not possible. Officials have to examine each case individually but they have failed to do this,” Simha said. Should have consulted people: BSYFormer CM BS Yediyurappa on Friday disapproved of the Bommai government’s move to clear places of worship from public places. He said the government should have consulted the stakeholders before taking up the drive. Speaking to reporters after meeting Suttur Mutt seer Shivaratri Deshikendra Swami, the former CM said, “It is wrong to demolish temples without consulting the local people and elected representatives. The CM should initiate measures to preserve the temples.” He added that the CM has taken corrective measures by halting the drive. Meanwhile, a senior official who is at the centre of the row, met Yediyurappa during his visit to the city. The official provided the details about the demolition of Mahadevamma temple at Huchchagani in Nanjangud taluk, which ignited the row. ‘State tour with Kateel’Yediyurappa said he will embark on a state tour along with state BJP chief Nalin Kumar Kateel ahead of panchayat polls after the ongoing assembly session. Yediyurappa also gave his successor Basavaraj Bommai a pat on his back saying the new CM is on the right track and providing good governance in the state. On whether, his younger son B Y Vijayendra, will contest from Varuna in Mysuru in the next assembly polls, the former CM said it will be decided by the party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/simha-questions-sidddaramaiahs-newfound-love-for-hindus/articleshow/86301052.cms||---

While only a few colleges in the urban area continue to feature in the ranking every year, colleges on the outskirts and the new ones have not shown much progress over the years. When asked for a reason, B L Siva Kumar, principal, Sri Ramakrishna College of Arts and Science, said most of the colleges featured in the ranking list were more than 20 years old. “Colleges should perform academically well with good placements and better infrastructure. It may not be possible for all the new colleges to build the infrastructure,” he said.

When put to scrutiny by TOI’s panel of experts with the ‘Times Verified’ initiative, it was found that the claims made in the video were misguiding. In reality, the video was from Pathankot where, during an organized endurance training activity, one soldier lost his life while many were injured due to extreme weather conditions. The death and injuries had nothing to do with Covid-19 vaccine. After the incident, Army sources had told ANI, “In an organised, supervised and monitored training activity near Pathankot, due to severe weather conditions, there has been one fatal casualty & few individuals admitted in Military Hospital Pathankot. The affected persons are being provided with requisite medical care.” Taking cognizance of the viral video, the Press Information Bureau (PIB) had clarified on August 30 that the video was fake. “It is being shared with the claim that many army personnel fainted after getting the vaccine. The video has nothing to do with the Covid-19 vaccination. The jawans had fainted due to the scorching heat and humidity,” PIB put out on its official handle on Twitter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/video-of-jawans-collapsing-wrongly-linked-to-ncov-vax/articleshow/86305845.cms||---

Addressing meet-the-press programme organised by Ernakulam Press Club in Kochi, Sudhakaran said that the government remains blind towards the incident though the state has become a fuming volcano. He demanded the government to stop discussions on ‘narcotic jihad’ remarks by the bishop. “The Congress party cannot remain silent seeing the secularism in the state being affected by such controversies, and it was the responsibility of the state government to resolve the issue. Though minister Vasavan visited the bishop, it was too late. There is no reason to not believe the bishop but the government has the responsibility to prove the truth about what he said. The rights and wrongs of the bishop’s words must be analysed together by all,” said Sudhakaran. Sudhakaran said that Vijayan sees Narendra Modi as his god. He said that for Congress, BJP and communal fascism are much bigger enemies than CPM. He said CPM should not be arrogant as they managed to win the elections and those leaving Congress are leaders without any supporters. Restructuring of Congress is not easy but it will be done soon, he added.

In January, this year, the traffic branch personnel took action against 84 motorists for driving on the wrong side of the road. However, in February, as the second wave of the pandemic had started, restrictions were imposed that resulted in lesser number of people stepping out of the house. In February, police booked 38 such people, while in March 33 people were fined. In April and May, the number had dropped to 13 and 14 respectively. In the following three moths — June, July and August — the action continued wherein 30, 62 and 66 motorists were respectively fined for driving their vehicles on the wrong side. ACP Sitaram Gaikwad, city traffic police, said road accidents prove fatal in many cases of wrong side driving. In 2019, the traffic police had booked 4,062 motorists for wrong side driving, while in 2020, the number went down to 599 owing to lockdown and other Covid-related restrictions imposed by the administration. The situation was same in March, April and May this year. “Action against those driving on the wrong side would continue in the future as well. The motorists should know that their negligent driving could lead to accidents,” Gaikwad said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-police-step-up-actions-against-wrong-side-driving/articleshow/86298800.cms||Santosh Sonawane

The four new routes introduced connect CBS in Nashik city with Pimpri Sayyad, Saikheda, Mahadi and Sukena. NMPML is the public transport wing of Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC), which took over city bus services from the cash-strapped Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC). The latter had expressed inability to provide proper services to city commuters. NMPML officials said that the four new routes have been started a couple of days back in order to connect the city with areas located towards the outskirts. “At present our fleet strength is 67 buses and these are plying on these 22 routes. The response from the commuters has been extremely encouraging,” added a transport utility official. The official said that four more routes are likely to be introduced from next week. “We are awaiting the green signal from a PSU firm as the buses would be plying within their jurisdiction. Once we get the nod, we shall go ahead and introduce these four new routes,” added the official. The public transport wing had started its bus service from the second week of July with a fleet strength of 50 buses. However, gradually NMPML has increased its fleet strength.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmpml-adds-four-new-bus-routes-in-nashik-city/articleshow/86298848.cms||---
---||Business||GST cess will be used till March 2026 to repay loans: Finance minister||NEW DELHI: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday said that the cess on goods such as soft drinks, tobacco, coal and cars will go towards repayment of loans to compensate states for GST (goods and services tax) shortfall up to March 2026, suggesting that the demand for states to extend the compensation period was a tough ask. Sitharaman also pointed to a study by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which had pegged the average GST levy at 11.5% against the revenue neutral rate of 15.5%, in what was a further indication that resources to compensate states longer than mandated were tough to come by. Over the last four years, the GST Council has cut rates on hundreds of items to provide relief to consumers. While some of the states, such as West Bengal, demanded an extension of compensation for any revenue shortfall - which is a promise of 14% annual growth - the finance minister made it clear that the law only provided for compensation up to July 2022. Some of the states, including those ruled by Opposition parties, conceded that this was a complex issue. The Centre presented estimates of revenue collection from compensation cess. "In this context various options, as have been recommended by various committees/forums, were presented. The GST Council deliberated at length on the issue. The GST Council decided to set up a GoM (group of ministers) to examine the issue of correction of inverted duty structure for major sectors, rationalise the rates and review exemptions from the point of view of revenue augmentation from GST," the finance minister said in a statement. While the compensation issue may not have been settled and Friday's discussions may be a starting point, states have argued that they needed to be supported for a few more years as the coronavirus pandemic had left them cash-strapped and full recovery would take at least one more year. The Covid-19 pandemic has forced the central government to borrow from the market to pay compensation to states, whose revenues had been hit and the 14% assured growth was tough to achieve. This has complicated the issue, while there is also realisation that states can't be allowed to "fall off the cliff" once the current regime ends.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/gst-cess-will-be-used-till-mar-26-to-repay-loans-fm/articleshow/86309596.cms||---

On Thursday, 42.21% of the students attended classes, while the attendance on Wednesday was 41.58%. On September 13 and 14, the percentage was even lower — 37.85% and 39.67%, respectively. Parents and teachers attributed this to the fear of Covid-19 while adding how many children are also down with viral fever, typhoid, dengue, among other diseases. Since September 1, over 50 students have tested positive for Covid-19. “When most private employees, especially those from the IT industry, are still working from home, how do schools or government officials expect us to send children to school at this stage? Many are down with Covid-like symptoms and positive cases are being reported from schools. I still don’t feel it is safe for my children to attend physical classes,” said Sai Prasad, a private employee, whose son is in class 7. Another parent, Srujana K, whose children are in class 8 and class 6, said that she will not send them to school this academic year. “When many children are down with dengue, typhoid, Covid-19 etc, the risk of my sons contracting it will be way higher if they go to school. We are going to continue with online education this year,” she added. Teachers confirmed that many students are still staying away from school citing health reasons. “Not even 50% of the students are attending physical classes. Even among those who are attending, many are irregular as they are down with fever or have fever-like symptoms,” said Prashanthi S, a private teacher. There are over 53.34 lakh students are studying in 37,769 schools in Telangana. Of them, about 31.96 lakh are enrolled in private schools while the remaining are in government schools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/15-days-on-schools-see-only-42-attendance/articleshow/86305871.cms||---

JD(U) MLC Khalid Anwar on Thursday said the allegations levelled by the minister for revenue and land reforms department, Ram Surat Kumar, that infiltrators were purchasing land in Seemanchal through some real estate dealers, is baseless. Anwar said that the minister should refrain from making such controversial statement and rather he should work for togetherness. "Nitish Kumar sarkar mein yah tarika thik nahi hai (this method is not good under Nitish's rule)," he asserted. The JD(U) legislator said that the way BJP minister was trying to raise the issue of infiltration in Seemanchal region, is apparently to take political mileage in the assembly polls to be held in Uttar Pradesh early next year. Taking a dig at the BJP MLA from Aurai assembly constituency in Muzaffarpur district, Anwar said, “The minister was trying to control the upcoming assembly polls in UP from Bihar by raising irrelevant issues.” Earlier, Gulam Rasool Balyawi of the JD(U) had condemned the minister’s statement and said that it was aimed at creating a division between people of two communities, who have been living together for ages. Purnia, Katihar, Araria and Kishanganj districts comprises of Seemanchal. The four districts close to international borders, have a sizable population of people belonging to the minority community. The state revenue and land reforms department minister had also said that the land belonging to temple, muth and religious trusts was being encroached upon in Seemanchal. He said the he has already alerted the state government about the infiltration issue. Meanwhile, state RJD chief Jagadanand Singh demanded resignation from PM Narendra Modi and CM Nitish Kumar for their failure to check infiltration in border districts of the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bjp-jdu-differ-on-infiltration-issue-in-seemanchal-districts/articleshow/86272918.cms||Ramashankar

A forest officer identified the deceased as R Chinnasamy, a resident of Viraliyur village. “He used to stay back on his farmland, which is located near a hill, at night to protect crops from the wild animal raid. He had set up a room for his night stay and stored onions there. Around 1.30am on Friday, he woke up hearing some sound. When he came out of the room, he saw a wild tusker and started running. However, the tusker chased him and attacked him. He suffered injuries to his chest and right leg.” When alerted, frontline staff with the Boluvampatti forest range rushed to the spot and took Chinnasamy to the government hospital at Thondamuthur, where doctors declared him dead on arrival. Later, the body was sent to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital for postmortem.

---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad may get rain after September 20||HYDERABAD: After a brief lull and dry weather for the past few days, rains are likely to make a comeback across the state from September 20, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Hyderabad. It has been close to 10 days that the city has not witnessed any heavy showers. While some parts of the city have experienced isolated thundershowers on a few days, widespread rains have been elusive for the past many days. But formation of a low pressure area in north Bay of Bengal is likely to bring back the rains in the city. “Low level easterlies would merge with the monsoon trough that lies in the south and trigger light to moderate spells of rains. Thunderstorm activity, especially during evenings, is likely to intensify,” said A Shravani, meteorologist, IMD, Hyderabad. Meteorologists said that monsoon was unlikely to retreat from the state as yet as two weather systems were expected to deliver more rains in central India.“Withdrawal of monsoon will commence from the north from October first week. During the withdrawal, we would expect some intense rains following which monsoon would gradually withdraw from the southern parts of the country as well,” said Shravani. As per IMD figures from June 1 till date, Telangana has recorded 34% excess rains at 911.3 mm as against normal of 681 mm. Hyderabad has recorded 21% excess rainfall at 664.2 mm as against normal of 549.3 mm so far. Of the 33 districts, five districts have recorded large excess rains, 18 districts have recorded excess rains and 10 districts have recorded normal rains this season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/city-may-get-rain-after-sept-20/articleshow/86305906.cms||---

The state has already administered two crore vaccine shots and a target of one more crore has been fixed. In Adilabad district, collector Sikta Patnaik, who has been visiting the vaccination centres, said on Friday the aim was to have 100% vaccine coverage for the eligible people.

Reportedly, farmers have been protesting at 17 toll plazas in different districts, including Jind, Hisar, Bhiwani, Sirsa, Rohtak, Panipat, Kurukshetra, Karnal and Bhiwani to press the demand of repealing three contentious farm laws passed by centre in June 2020. Notably, farmers in Haryana had ensured a free passage for commuters at all toll plazas like their Punjab counterparts from December 26, observing a SKM call. According to farmers, they will hold a meeting at Khatkar toll plaza where they will form a joint committee in which members from each toll plaza will be involved. The committee would be known as STM, which will coordinate with SKM, a 40-member committee and spearheading the agitation from Singhu border of Sonipat district. The STM will coordinate with SKM in future so that their call can be implemented effectively at state level in a disciplined manner. Moreover, farmers will make a plan and strategy to provide a strong back up to their counterparts if Bastara toll plaza like incidents happened again, where over 10 farmers were injured after police used force on the behest of then sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Ayush Sinha.Talking to TOI, Captain (retired) Bhupender Jaglan, a key member at Khatkar toll plaza said, “We are planning to induct a president of STM along with his team, who will ensure consistent contacts with SKM for implementing the calls to strengthen the ongoing protest against the anti farmers laws. Moreover, now presence would be enhanced at toll plaza and Delhi borders as the Modi government is hatching a conspiracy again to split the agitation. If action is taken at Delhi borders our sanyukt toll morcha will ensure strong reactions in all parts of Haryana promptly. The saffron party started using force on farmers to suppress the voice who have been sitting from November 27 peacefully for genuine demands, therefore farmers are getting ready to fight against their ill will,” he added. Jind BKU (charuni) president Azad Palwan said “the Modi led government again seeking conspiracy to defame the innocent farmers. But we will ensure their politics with our tactics like farmers have proved in the past. We are planning to take the agitation at village level now like Delhi borders and toll plazas. The Modi led government should use their energy to speak with farmers which is closed from January 22, 20201 rather than wasting time on hatching conspiracy,” he asserted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farmers-to-form-joint-toll-group-too/articleshow/86305980.cms||---

All data was submitted for EUL application to WHO in early July. We have responded to any clarification sought by WHO and are awaiting further feedback,” Bharat Biotech tweeted on Friday. “We are continuing to work diligently on obtaining WHO EUL at the earliest,” the firm said, adding that “as a responsible manufacturer with past approvals for our other vaccines we do not find it appropriate to speculate or comment on approval process & its timelines”. There has been considerable speculation about when the vaccine would get WHO approval due to concerns over those vaccinated by Covaxin facing restrictions in international travel. A WHO approval would open the doors to several countries for the indigenously developed Covaxin. According to the latest WHO guidance document on the status of Covid-19 vaccines within the EUL/PQ evaluation process, dated August 19, 2021, Bharat Biotech’s whole virion inactivated virus vaccine is currently under review and a decision on the vaccine’s EUL application is awaited.

Now that it has been resolved, portion of a private land measuring around 5,000sqft on the stretch connecting Trichy-Dindigul NH (Ponnagar) with the Central bus stand via Ambedkar statue has been acquired. Officials said that the present width of the road is between 3.5m and 5.5m. The narrow width hindered the movement of buses during peak hours. “We will prepare the estimate to widen the road from 3.5m to 7m. Electricity poles will be relocated for regulating the traffic movement,” an official said.The department has started preparing the cost estimate for the project which is likely to be initiated in the next three months. Welcoming the move, residents demanded the streamlining of the haphazard parking of tourist vehicles and cars underneath the arms of the RoB. “At multiple places, the rapid parking of vehicles is equally affecting the free movement of vehicles. The stakeholders must streamline the vacant space adjacent to the service roads too,” T Ramalingam, a resident of RMS Colony said. They also sought more LED Lights in the service lanes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/land-acquired-to-widen-service-road-of-flyover/articleshow/86305976.cms||Deepak Karthik

Both Covishield and Covaxin will be available at all the camps, officials said. Corporation sources said a lot system will be deployed among those getting vaccinated across the 126 spots in four zones who stand to win silk saris and android smartphones worth Rs 10,000 each. While the number of winners is yet to be finalised, at least 10 people are likely to be selected from a zone. Some of the centres where the vaccination will be held include Renga school at Raghavendrapuram, Srimad Andavan college in Thiruvanaikoil, Gandhi market, Nadharshah Darga, EB Road corporation school, Periyar Maniammai complex in KK Nagar, Seva Sangam school in Cantonment, Central bus stand, Bishop Heber college on Vayalur road, KAP School in Thillai Nagar and SIT College in Ariyamangalam. Going by last Sunday’s experience, the civic body is eyeing a similar reception. “Last time, only those who took the jab in K Abishekapuram zone were given prizes. The initiative has now been expanded to other corporation zones. We expect the patronage to improve further,” an official with Trichy corporation said. The gifts seemed to have lured a section of residents into taking the jab as there were enquiries on the type of gifts available at the camps organised last weekend. While the civic body vaccinated over 18,200 people last Sunday, this time, it aims to vaccinate about 26,000. Each of the 126 centres has been allotted 200 doses. Officials said that the public address system will be utilised to encourage people to come forward for the vaccination. The city has already vaccinated 58% of the eligible population as of September 16.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-corpn-offers-phones-saris-to-boost-vax-drive-tomorrow/articleshow/86305997.cms||---

The CLP discussed the prevailing Covid situation in Goa and appealed to people to take all precautions and take the vaccine at the earliest. However when asked about state party president Girish Chodankar’s vaccine hesitancy, opposition leader Digambar Kamat brushed the question aside. “It is shocking, we are shocked that 68 deaths that occurred earlier were not reported for the last three months. We urge the chief minister to issue a detailed clarification on the lapses and goof-ups and place before the public the corrective actions taken by the government,” said Kamat. Of the five Congress MLAs, Ponda MLA Ravi Naik remained conspicuous by his absence. Congress MLAs said that the party will start preparing for the two-day assembly session that has been summoned in October. They also discussed the prevailing law and order situation, crimes against women, land acquisition for South Western Railway’s (SWR) double-tracking project through Goa’s forests and villages and the Goa Bhumiputra Adhikarini Bill. “The government did not conduct a proper study and take all stakeholders into confidence before presenting the Goa Bhumiputra Adhikarini Bill in the assembly,” said Poriem MLA Pratapsingh Rane. Kamat also said that the move by bakers to increase the rate of pao from October 2 will affect every Goan. “The CLP condemned the lethargic approach of the government and its failure to look into the various issues raised by bakers. The CLP urges the government to immediately implement the ‘Goenchem Daiz’ scheme which will give substantial relief to traditional bakers. Navelim MLA Luizinho Faleiro questioned the state government’s seriousness about protecting people’s health and ensuring good quality fish. Faleiro said, “90% of the fish entering Goa is laced with Formalin and it is slowly killing Goans.” Kamat also said that iron ore mining should resume immediately. “We are insisting that mining should start as soon as possible. Now they are saying that they have formed a mining corporation but nothing is happening,” said Kamat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/shocked-that-68-covid-deaths-went-unreported-congress-mlas/articleshow/86306078.cms||---

Despite being at a prime location in the city close to various administrative offices including treasury and social welfare departments, the government property is brimming with sullage from where wastewater flows into residential roads and houses.Residents of Friends Enclave in Maris Avenue falling under ward 46 in Cantonment said sullage water is entering the TANSI campus on the old collector office road regularly. This has been an issue ever since the campus was abandoned about a decade ago. During rain, the stagnant water soars over the compound wall of the abandoned industrial centre to inundate residential settlements near the district collectorate. The low-lying areas and houses built decades ago were the most to suffer the ordeal as narrow residential roads were getting submerged and houses inundated even after a mild rainfall. Residents said the lack of a proper mechanism to divert sullage water arriving from Chinna Milaguparai was causing the inconvenience. “This issue remains unaddressed for several years, Trichy corporation has to take a stand and provide us a permanent solution. Sullage stagnating in our locality is complicating our livelihood,” Kamakshi Narayanan, a 78-year-old resident of Friends Enclave, said.While Trichy corporation is planning to build a stormwater drain in the locality to divert the surplus rainwater to the adjoining Uyyakondan canal, residents are apprehensive over the outcome as there is no solution to preventing sullage from entering TANSI complex. “At a cost of Rs 7 lakh, we will establish stormwater drains to prevent inundation. As far as TANSI campus is concerned, we have to discuss with the relevant authority,” an official source with Trichy corporation said. The residents said that about 3 acres of the area of TANSI can be utilised for government offices or for other utilitarian needs as the facility presently serves as a pool of sullage, leading to proliferation of mosquitoes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/sullage-overflows-from-tansi-campus/articleshow/86305988.cms||Deepak Karthik

A handbook was also released by the district collector to guide the farmers for the same.Samba paddy cultivation for this season has been ongoing in around 3.25 lakh acres of land in Thanjavur district. After the completion of the samba and thaladi harvest, farmers take up black gram cultivation by adopting the rice fallow pulses method every year.According to officials from the agriculture department, farmers usually cultivate black gram in 40,000 acres every year. So far, around 30,000 acres have already been covered this current season. The department has prepared an action plan to enhance the area further by 35,000 acres this season alone, officials said. To attain the target, officials have accelerated awareness programmes among the farmers in the district.A detailed handbook has been prepared by the agriculture department to educate farmers to help them attain the targeted pulses production, officials added. District collector Dinesh Ponraj Oliver released the handbook in the presence of joint director of agriculture department, A Justin.National food security mission was launched to increase food grains production, including pulses. Productivity would be achieved through the expansion of cultivable areas under the mission. Restoration of soil fertility and creation of employment opportunities would also be attained by creating awareness among the farmers about the use of improved seed and crop production technology, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/bid-to-widen-area-under-black-gram-cultivation/articleshow/86305992.cms||---

TIDCO officials had visited six villages in the two taluks and identified the land for the park a few months ago. District revenue department officials said the TIDCO officials had identified the land at Akkaraisengampalli, Kuppanur, Pogalur and Vadakkalur villages in Annur taluk, and Iluppanatham and Bellepalayam villages in Mettupalayam taluk. A revenue official said, “They have identified 3,800 acres vacant land in the two taluks. More than 80% of the land is owned by private companies. TIDCO will bear the land acquisition expenses. As of now, surveyors from Mettupalayam and Annur taluks have completed the land survey in the six villages.” Two months ago, TIDCO officials from Chennai had visited the villages and inspected the vacant land in the presence of district revenue officer P S Leela Alex, Annur tahsildar Rathinam and other revenue department officials. “The land value is yet to be finalized. Once TIDCO approves the land acquisition, we will start basic works. The industrial park will generate job opportunities for the youths in the district,” the official said. District collector G S Sameeran told TOI that it would be a huge industrial park. “Our main duty is to acquire land for TIDCO to set up the park, which would spur the growth of industrial sectors in the district.” Another source said the project was in its initial stages. “Once the land acquisition begins, TIDCO officials will conduct a meeting with the entrepreneurs in the district and decide on the type of the park.” TIDCO facilitates large industrial and infrastructure projects in the state with large investments and huge employment potential. It is the development agency for the Chennai-Bengaluru industrial corridor, Chennai-Kanyakuumari industrial corridor, Western corridor (Kochi-Bengaluru industrial corridor) and defence industrial corridor projects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/district-administration-to-acquire-3800-acres-for-industrial-park/articleshow/86305993.cms||A Subburaj

The fruit market vendors’ welfare association is challenging the decision of the market committee to surrender the land belonging to the Gaddiannaram market committee to the state. “The objective may be laudable, but the market committee has no power to gift its land. If it disposes of the land, it should be done for furthering the cause of the market,” the petitioner said. Countering the petitioners, the state counsel said that the present market would be shifted temporarily to 40 acres at Bata Sigaram market and then finally moved to Koheda where a 178-acre fruit market was being constructed by the state. The bench comprising Acting Chief Justice M S Ramachandra Rao and Justice T Vinod Kumar directed the authorities to produce all records, including the resolution of the market committee to hand over its land to the state. The case has been posted to Sept 29 for further hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-seeks-records-of-fruit-market-land/articleshow/86306005.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

In a press conference in Mavelikkara on Friday, the leaders of the Council urged those indulging in communal propaganda on social media to desist from doing so. They said that such propaganda created communal polarisation in society. They also urged the strong intervention of political and religious leaders for strengthening social unity. People should resist all terrorist activities and the spread and use of narcotics. It is our responsibility to safeguard the integrity, unity, secularism and democratic ideals of our country. The heads of each religion should point out mistakes and correct them and create awareness against evils. Common issues should be solved through public discussions. Public protests have to be avoided as they will only increase hatred, the council said. The meeting also opined that for the wrongdoing of a small section, the entire society should not be blamed.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Pup lives it up business class! All booked just for pet & owner||MUMBAI: You gotta be one hell of a lucky dog to enjoy such a flight of fancy. A pet dog recently winged its way from Mumbai to Chennai by business class for which the canine’s owner would have shelled out more than Rs 2.5 lakh for the 2-hour-long flight. And this has come at a time when domestic flights are packed to capacity. The entire business class of the Air India flight was empty, but for two passengers — a human and the pet. The owner had booked the entire business class to fly the Maltese pet in luxury. The snow-white ball of fur boarded the Air India flight AI-671 early on Wednesday morning, said a source. “The J-class cabin on Air India A320 aircraft has 12 seats, so the cute pup flew in luxury,” the source added. Business class fare on Air India Mumbai-Chennai is priced around Rs 20,000. Though pets have travelled in Air India business class before it’s probably the first time that the entire business class was booked to fly a pet. One such known case of a pet on board a flight was in 2018 when a dog and owner flew business class on Air India Bengaluru to Delhi flight — Pets are allowed inside passenger cabin subject to approval by the commander of the flight. Air India’s spokesperson did not comment when asked about details of the furry passenger.  Air India is the only Indian carrier that lets domestic pets in the passenger cabin. At most, two small pets are allowed on a flight and the pet is seated in the last row of the booked class. Pet traffic was high on Air India in 2020. Between June and September, it flew 2,000 pets on its domestic flights.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-pup-lives-it-up-biz-class-all-booked-just-for-pet-owner/articleshow/86306069.cms||---
---||Salem||‘Discriminatory wall’ in Namakkal village razed||Namakkal: An alleged discriminatory wall at Muthukalipatti near Rasipuram in Namakkal district was demolished by the officials on Friday, significantly on reformer E V R Periyar’s birth anniversary celebrated as Social Justice Day. The villagers said a non-dalit named Paramasivam had encroached upon the government land that was used as pathway to Ambedkar Nagar for several years. A few years ago, Paramasivam built a 25-ft long wall blocking the pathway to Ambedkar Nagar. The residents had other access road, but that was a circuitous one. The residents had been demanding the government authorities to demolish the wall, evict the encroachments from the government land and restore the pathway. However, no action was taken forcing the villagers to hoist black flags atop their houses last month. They also lodged a fresh complaint with the district administration, accusing the local revenue officials of acting hand in glove with Paramasivam. As the district administration initiated a probe and found that the wall was built on government land, the authorities ordered demolition of the structure. A meeting was also conducted to assuage the dalits to withdraw the protest plans and Paramasivam was directed to demolish the wall on his own. But he refused claiming that he had ownership over the land. So, the officials visited the spot along with police protection and razed down the structure. “We are happy that the wall has been removed. The fact that the wall was demolished on Periyar’s birth anniversary has made it even more remarkable,” M Samiraj, a resident of Ambedkar Nagar, said. Officials admitted that a portion of the wall was built on government land encroached upon by Paramasivam but said it cannot be considered as a “untouchability wall,” as dalits had other passage way. On the delay for demolishing the wall, the officials said that demolition could be done only after giving Paramasivam due notice and time to respond.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/salem/discriminatory-wall-in-namakkal-village-razed/articleshow/86306058.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Of the 12 historic shrines, four are in Belur taluk, while both Arasikere and Arkalgud taluks house three each, while Hassan taluk is home to two temples.In 2018, the officials concerned, after a thorough examination of the condition of the shrines, submitted a proposal for their renovation to the government. According to their estimation, the funds required for restoring the 12 shrines was Rs 18.7 crore. Tourism department officials attributed the delay to the financial crisis that the government was grappling with in the wake of the Covid-induced crisis. The Anjaneyaswamy temple and Muttina Veerabhadreshwara remple in Halebidu, Yoganarasimhaswamy temple in Narasimhapura and Malleshwara temple in Hagare are the four shrines in Belur taluk, the restoration of which is estimated to cost Rs 3.6 crore. In Arasikere taluk, the Ramalingeshwara and Krishna temples in Bendekere, and Someshwara shrine in Haranahalli await restoration. The cumulative cost of renovating these three temples is pegged at Rs 3.45 crore.The condition of the two Rameshwara temples, both at Ramanathapura, and the Eshwara temple in Muttige village in Arkalgud taluk is pitiable, and the authorities estimate the restoration of the three shrines to cost Rs 6.1 crore. In Hassan taluk, the Govindeshwara and Nakeshwara temple in Koravangala and the Vishnu temple in Hirekadaluru are slated for renovation, for which a sum of Rs 5.5 crore has been deemed necessary.State archaeological conservation assistant engineer J Satheesh said that all the 12 shrines would be restored. “We will reinforce the base of the temples, the stones will be numbered, and those painted with lime will be cleaned. The sanctum tower will also be built and the main doors replaced with new teakwood one,” Satheesh said.Curator HC Kumar said, “The Govindeshwara and Nakeshwara, Someshwara, Muttina Veerabhadreshwara and the two Rameshwara temples are protected by the state archaeological department. Most of these temples have been built in adherence to the principles of the Hoysala and Vijayanagara styles of architecture. Once they are renovated, the remaining seven shrines will also be brought under the purview of the state archaeology department. Once renovated, these shrines will add to the potential Hassan has for tourism.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/12-historic-shrines-in-hassan-district-await-restoration/articleshow/86301266.cms||---

---||Mysuru||Patrolling stepped up across Mysuru; mobile units pressed into service||Mysuru: In the aftermath of the gangrape of the student at Lalithadripura hillock, located next to Chamundi Hills, Mysuru city police have stepped up patrolling across the Heritage City, in order to make the people feel more secure. Surveillance during the night has been intensified, and additional drivers roped in to drive the patrol vehicles. Police personnel deployed on surveillance vehicles, equipped with recording devices, have been asked to frequent the deserted parts on the outskirts of the city. Police are increasingly using the ‘Mobile Command Vehicle’, a bus equipped with high-tech cameras, more extensively as part of the surveillance routine. The automobile was hitherto reserved for use during the Mysuru Dasara celebrations or similar events to prevent untoward incidents among the crowd. The bus is being stationed at different locations each day across the city, including close to girls’ colleges. The camera has a range of 500m, and anything within that radius is captured with clarity. Cops deployed on the automobile will be able to instantly alert their superiors should they spot anyone moving suspiciously, or find anyone behaving inappropriately. On the other hand, the public have been sharing information with police using the emergency response support system number – 112 – to alert them about the movement of suspicious people in their neighbourhood. Police personnel have been stepped up on the outskirts, particularly in localities along the Outer Ring Road (ORR), and officials directed to monitor security in areas identified as being ‘crime prone’ in their jurisdiction. Mysuru city police commissioner Chandragupta expressed confidence that increased police presence would serve as an effective deterrent against crime. “Every nook and cranny will be policed by cops day and night. Surveillance has been intensified after dusk. All officers across police stations have been directed to visit previously identified spots and deserted areas in their jurisdiction,” he said. Apart from the mobile command vehicle, four interceptors and patrolling jeeps will be ubiquitous around the city, Chandragupta said. “The vehicles have high-vision cameras and can record events in crowded places,” the city police commissioner said. Cops managed to nab the accused in the gangrape case, and in the jewellery heist and murder reported in Vidyaranyapuram, and in both cases, those who were apprehended were not from Karnataka. In both cases, the accused fled the city after perpetrating the crimes, prompting cops to introspect on the security measures adopted in Mysuru.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/patrolling-stepped-up-across-mysuru-mobile-units-pressed-into-service/articleshow/86301298.cms||Lawrence Milton

---||Delhi||Northeast Delhi riots cases: Police rapped for ‘lackadaisical approach’||NEW DELHI: A Delhi court came down heavily on police for its “lackadaisical approach” in handling northeast Delhi riots cases, saying it would pass adverse orders against them, including adjournment costs with directions to deduct it from their salaries, if they failed to ensure proper prosecution.  Chief metropolitan Magistrate Arun Kumar Garg directed Delhi Police commissioner to personally look into the matter. The observations came after the court found that the special public prosecutor, representing the police, failed to appear before the court despite repeated calls and the investigating officer came to the court late without reading the police file and was unable to answer the court’s queries. “Such lackadaisical approach on the part of the prosecution as well as the investigating agency in riots cases has been repeatedly brought to the notice of not only the DCP North East and Joint CP Eastern Range but has also been brought to the notice of the commissioner of police, Delhi. However, no steps for proper prosecution of the cases seem to have been taken by either of them and if taken, have not yet been brought to the notice of this court,” it said in the order. The court further said the failure on the part of police officers to take appropriate measures for prosecution of riots cases was causing avoidable delay in committal/trial of riots cases. “I deem it appropriate to once again direct the police commissioner to personally look into the issues pointed out by this court and to ensure proper prosecution of the riots cases, failing which the court shall be constrained to pass adverse order as per law against the state, including but not limited to imposition of adjournment costs with a further direction to deduct the same from the salary of the officers responsible for imposition of the said cost,” the judge said. The court further directed the police commissioner to ensure the presence of DCP NE before it, if he wishes to avail the opportunity of personal hearing on the next date so as to apprise it about the difficulties if any faced by him in compliance of its directions, failing which an appropriate order would be passed as per law without any further opportunity of hearing to him. It ordered that a copy of the order be also sent to Delhi’ lieutenant governor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/riots-cops-rapped-for-lackadaisical-approach/articleshow/86330444.cms||---

Company has claimed that because their bills are not cleared by JMC, they are unable to pay their workers. Company has done number of strikes in the last four years. Sanitation condition of the city is not up to the mark with hoopers not going on time. As per the original contract, BVG company was supposed to provide all the hoopers but JMC had purchased more than 130 hoopers. Out of these, many were given on rent to the company to run. Twenty-five compactors worth Rs 9.5 crore to pick up garbage were purchased by the JMC, Greater in December 2020 that are still not been in used. An official on condition of anonymity said, “We purchased hoopers but didn’t have enough manpower to run it. Hence, we decided to give it on rent to them. Compactors were purchased to start picking up garbage in one zone but with so many court cases that is of no use.” During the time of Somya Gurjar, JMC Greater started picking up garbage from two wards using their own resources but after her suspension the problem was back to the same place. In every ward of JMC, Greater and Heritage, hoopers are not coming on time. Despite number of complaints filed by the residents and councillors sanitation condition if degrading. On Friday, BVG company has said that they will release the salary of the employees soon. BVG company project manager Umed Singh Dheerawat said, “We have received our payment from JMC, Heritage through which we will pay all our employees. We would request the employees to start working.” However, company employees have refused to work until all their 11 demands are accepted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/garbage-menace-continues-amid-workers-strike-in-city/articleshow/86306111.cms||---

A high-level business delegation of 30 members is expected to visit Ahmedabad and Rajkot in the last week of September, facilitated by Saurashtra Vepar Udyog Mahamandal (SVUM), the apex body of MSMEs in the region. African countries are heavily dependent on imports and India is one of their favoured countries. Parag Tejura, president of SVUM, said, “Uganda high commissioner contacted me to facilitate the visit and interaction of this delegation. This visit is a big opportunity for local industries. They have also written to the state government regarding this visit.” According to Tejura, the delegation is likely to land in Ahmedabad on September 27 and hold B2B meetings along with factory visits for three days. Thereafter, they will come to Rajkot for the same. Uganda is interested in importing machinery to make dairy products, ice-cream, toilet and tissue paper, corn flour, animal food, tomato ketchup, chilly sauce, bakery products and peanut butter from India. Rajkot is the hub of engineering and various kinds of machinery.  “Two high-level delegations in the past had visited Ahmedabad and Rajkot factories but this the biggest team coming till date. They want to buy plants and machinery as well as ready-made material. They are also keen on getting training and technical knowhow from us ,” Tejura added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/uganda-looking-to-import-food-machinery-from-india/articleshow/86305830.cms||---
---||India||Shot in the arm: India records 2.5 crore jabs on PM's birthday||NEW DELHI: India administered a staggering 2.5 crore Covid vaccinations on Friday setting a record for single day inoculations as part of a special drive to mark Prime Minister Narendra Modi's birthday. The government is also gearing up for another inoculation milestone - the completion of 100 crore inoculations. While no date has been fixed to achieve this target, the health ministry is eyeing October 7 as a likely day, marking 20 years of Modi heading a government either at the state level or the Centre. A total of 79.25 crore doses have been administered since the beginning of the vaccination drive. This includes over 59.52 crore first doses and 19.72 crore second doses. With this around 63% of the country's adult population above 18 has received at least one anti-Covid jab, whereas nearly 21% have received both doses. According to the ourworldindata website, 42% of India's population has received one or two doses, while the global average is 43%. Among nations with large populations, China has covered 73%, US 63% and UK 71%. The rolling seven-day average of daily vaccinations (as of September 16) per 100 people. In terms of total shots per 100 population, India is 55/100. According to the ourworldindata website, 42% of India's population has received one or two doses, while the global average is 43%. Among nations with large populations, China has covered 73%, US 63% and UK 71%. The rolling seven-day average of daily vaccinations (as of September 16) per 100 people (in total population) shows India at 0.52, with Turkey (0.63), Brazil (0.85), Japan (0.96), South Korea (1.46) and Cuba (2.15). In terms of total shots per 100 population, India is 55/100. The record number of inoculations on Friday were helped by a significant increase in the number of vaccination sites. Over 1.10 lakh sites conducted vaccinations on Friday, of which 97% were in the government sector. Vaccination sites in the private sector remained at just 3,449. Bihar was the surprise performer, organising a maximum of 13,958 vaccination sites, while Uttar Pradesh had 13,401 and Karnataka 12,063 sites. While the Centre asked states to encourage vaccination and announced the special vaccination drive "Vaccine Seva" to mark PM Modi's birthday, BJP spearheaded the campaign at the party level to accomplish the target. "We are doing about 4,000 vaccinations every second. We did not set any targets. This is a spontaneous outpouring of how citizens feel. We have ensured there is adequate availability of vaccines," an official source said. Over 7.68 crore doses of anti-Covid jabs were available with states on Thursday evening and this helped boost vaccination, the source said. States like Bihar, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat administered the maximum number of doses. While Bihar - which had a slow uptake of vaccines initially - was the frontrunner with 27.81 lakh doses till 10pm, Karnataka was close behind with 27.80 lakh doses, whereas UP, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat also delivered over 20 lakh doses during the day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/shot-in-the-arm-india-records-2-5-crore-jabs-on-pms-birthday/articleshow/86309660.cms||Sushmi Dey
---||Lucknow||Study on dietary analysis gives clues on protecting Red Panda||LUCKNOW: In a first, a team of 12 scientists from Lucknow’s Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeosciences (BSIP) and Sikkim-based Botanical Survey of India (BSI) have discovered that the Red Pandas found in the eastern Himalayas region of the country not only eat Bamboos, like other Pandas, but also consume ferns/leaves of a few specific trees. The team studied the food pattern/dietary analysis of the Red Panda with intention to aid policymakers in protecting and locating the habitats of the ‘real Panda’. The study has been recently published in the renowned international journal of Nature group ‘Scientific Reports’. “We did a detailed eating habit analysis of the Red Panda with the help of their dung collected from trees. Such researches play significant role in protecting the endangered species as through it we can trace their food requirements which are must for survival,” said senior BSIP scientist Swati Tripathi She said the team carried out a detailed multi-proxy analysis of the Panda dung samples collected from trees in Darjeeling and eastern Himalayas during both summer and winter seasons. In the multi-proxy analysis, scientists look back into the past ecosystem with help of the available records and data, reconstruct it and then study changes in the food pattern of an animal or anything related to the ecosystem, she added. Explaining further, BSIP senior scientist Sadhan K Basumatary said, “Himalayan Red Pandas are listed as a critically endangered species and are treated as ‘living fossils because they are not related to any other living species, including the black and white bear generally referred to as Panda but with no relation with the red Panda. They represent one of the most important wildlife species in the Eastern Himalayas.” He said the Red Panda lives in a highly restricted habitat, which is under stress against climatic change and human encroachments. While Pandas are known as bamboo eaters, this study indicates that their diet also depends on Lepisorus ferns and other broadleaved taxa like Betula, Engelhardtia, Rhododendron and Quercus. BSI senior scientist Rajib Gogoi said, “It was a challenging task to collect Panda dung samples due to its very limited population and unique defecating behaviour on tree trunks covered by mosses. We carried out an extensive survey to collect these dung samples for advanced scientific analyses.” “After studying the dung, I found out that there were changes in the diet of the Red Panda in the summer and winter season. We also found that they were not just eating Bamboos but leaves of other trees also,” said senior scientist Rajesh Agnihotri. Director BSIP Vandana Prasad said, “It is a very important study carried out by BSIP scientists, which should attract policymakers for promulgating awareness about endangered Indian Red Pandas and securing their delicate habitat under threat against climate change and human encroachment.” Where are they found? The Red Panda is a highly endangered (endemic) and threatened species in its habitat (northeast India and China) and its distribution is confined to five Asian countries, Nepal, India, Bhutan, northern Myanmar, and China. In India, they are commonly found mainly in the Sikkim, Darjeeling and Kalimpong districts of West Bengal, and Arunachal Pradesh. The name Panda comes from the Nepali word ‘ponya,’ which means bamboo or plant-eating animal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/studying-its-diet-can-help-save-red-panda/articleshow/86307546.cms||Mohita Tewari
---||Chennai||Rs 1,000 crore urban infrastructure scheme launched in Tamil Nadu||CHENNAI: The DMK government in Tamil Nadu has rolled out an ambitious Rs 1,000 crore Kalaignar Nagarpura Membattu Thittam (KNMT) to fill the infrastructure gaps in the urban local bodies, especially municipalities and town panchayats. Soon, each urban local body would embark on detailed surveys ward-wise and prepare an urban development plan (UDP) to get to know the availability or otherwise of the basic infrastructure. The state has 14 corporations, 121 municipalities and 528 town panchayats. While the Smart Cities Mission and AMRUT improve the infrastructure of 11 corporations and 28 towns, the state government has come up with the new scheme to support the municipalities and the town panchayats. Provision of 100% household tap connections, sewer links, and roads are capital-intensive schemes and mostly the prominent areas of the urban local bodies are covered. “Infrastructure gaps exist in many backward areas/slums, and newly added areas of the municipalities and town panchayats,” municipal administration and water supply secretary Shiv Das Meena said in an order, justifying the decision to give preference to these areas under KNMT. The detailed surveys would look into availability of water supply, sanitation, internal roads, streetlights, burial grounds/crematoriums, and other community infrastructure. As far as roads go, a detailed network plan would be prepared, including all major roads of various agencies, national and state highways, and municipalities and town panchayats (access and interior roads). With respect to water supply, total demand, supply and future needs will be incorporated, based on which a ‘city water balance plan’ would be prepared for each local body. Apart from water supply, streetlights and roads, the guidelines issued for the implementation of the scheme also suggested community infrastructure like community halls, markets and modern libraries with computers to assist the students and job aspirants. Modern bus stands, rejuvenation of water bodies, procurement of vehicles for solid waste management, development of parks, playfields, construction and renovation of public toilets will be encouraged under KNMT. Tamil Nadu Urban Finance and Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (Tufidco) is the nodal agency for KNMT. “The commissioners of municipal administration and town panchayats will send the proposals to the nodal agency which in turn would apprise and put up the proposals to the project sanctioning and monitoring committee for approval and administrative sanction,” Shiv Das Meena said. Work within places of worship or land belonging to or owned by religious faiths/groups, acquisition of land, assets for individuals and work in government-aided, self-financing schools and colleges are among those prohibited under the KNMT.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/1000-crore-urban-infrastructure-scheme-launched-in-tamil-nadu/articleshow/86309694.cms||Julie Mariappan

The Declaration by the SCO, which includes as member-states India and Pakistan, also called for greater defence cooperation and underscored the importance of holding regular joint military counter-terrorism command and staff exercises to enhance cooperation in combating "armed formations of international terrorist organisations and to improve counter-terrorism methods." Like on previous occasions, India was the only member-state to not endorse China's BRI in the joint Declaration. On Afghanistan, the SCO said it supported the emergence of Afghanistan as an independent, neutral, united, democratic and peaceful state, free of terrorism, war and drugs. The group is also said to be considering the establishment of the SCO Counter-Terrorism Centre in Dushanbe as a separate permanent body to counter security threats. While condemning terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, the Declaration said member-states were convinced that an important focus of the global counter-terrorism struggle should be to deprive terrorism of its social foundations, including eliminating poverty, unemployment and illiteracy. "They will step up their own efforts to prevent the preparation and financing of acts of terrorism in their territories and deny terrorists safe havens, enhance cooperation to identify, prevent and suppress the activities of organisations and individuals involved in terrorism, separatism and extremism," it said. While India remains reluctant to participate in any anti-terror exercise in Pakistan, it signed on the Declaration that called on member-states to continue to conduct joint anti-terrorism exercises, including the upcoming Pabbi Anti-Terror - 2021 exercise in Pakistan. India has so far not confirmed its participation in the exercise.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/deny-terrorists-finance-safe-havens-says-sco/articleshow/86309741.cms||---
---||Chennai||GST council agenda did not have much, so skipped meet, says Tamil Nadu finance minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan||CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu minister for finance and human resources Palanivel Thiaga Rajan on Friday said in Madurai that he did not participate in the GST council meet in Lucknow due to prior commitments in the constituency and the fact that nothing important would be discussed at the meet as per the agenda sent to states. He had received the invitation for the meeting only after September 10 and got himself excused by informing chief minister M K Stalin that he had committed to participate in many events in Madurai. As per the initial agenda received, nothing seemed important, and it was decided that the finance secretary and commissioner for commercial taxes would attend it on his behalf, he said. “However, in the additional item sent 3-4 days ago, there were 5-6 important items in regard to GST compensation and so I read the 500-odd pages and answered each item in detail on TN’s stand,’’ he said. In his speech submitted at the council meeting, Thiaga Rajan said TN opposed the move to include sale of petroleum products under the GST regime as it is one of the last few taxing rights states have under post-GST regime. The state’s concerns increased manifold since the Centre raised taxation between 500% and 1,000% since 2014. And also the fact that the Centre had changed the mix of this taxation from over 90% excise (shareable with the states) and less than 10% cess and surcharge (not shared with states) in 2014 to only about 4% remaining in the form of excise and rest 96% as cess and surcharge. “Also, we did not expect the Union government to say there was no dial-in option to attend the meeting and that it was 100% physical, which was announced a few days ago,’’ he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/gst-council-agenda-did-not-have-much-so-skipped-meet-says-tamil-nadu-finance-minister-palanivel-thiaga-rajan/articleshow/86309744.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Stray dog beaten to death, those responsible ‘laugh it off’||Nagpur: While the judiciary is taking efforts to safeguard the welfare of animals, there seems to be no end to brutal cruelty against them in the city. On Thursday night, a stray dog was mercilessly beaten to death using rods by a caretaker of a residential society in Sonegaon. Incidentally, the same day, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court took suo motu cognisance of a TOI report on the plight of a retired dog which had served for the country. The incident reportedly took place around 9pm following which animal activist Sameer Ukey received a phone call. “When we reached on spot, the dog was in a terrible condition. The animal had itching problem due to which it would smell. From the information we got, the building’s caretaker wanted to get rid of the dog. When it didn’t move away, caretaker called up a few labourers and they together started beating him up with heavy rods,” said Ukey. Ukey sought help from animal activist Karishma Galani, who is also the member of Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA). “We immediately called for the ambulance and took the dog to hospital. But the injuries were so bad that the animal couldn’t survive,” said Galani. Senior police inspector Kishor Nagrale (special branch), who is also the member of SPCA, helped the activists in filing a first information report (FIR) in the case. As per activists, the identified culprits “showed no signs of remorse”. “They were laughing inside the police station, saying what was the harm in killing an animal. The educated residents of the society also seemed relieved that the dog was killed. It is unfortunate that citizens lack basic sensitivity and awareness,” said activists. In July this year, TOI reported about alleged mass killing of stray dogs by residents of an apartment scheme in Besa. They had allegedly poisoned 15-20 strays in a span of 30 days. The non-effectiveness of animal birth control (ABC) operations in the city is believed to be a major trigger of such brutal acts. “The population of dogs in the city has significantly increased. The civic body needs to do sterilization in a scientific manner,” said activists.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/stray-dog-beaten-to-death-those-responsible-laugh-it-off/articleshow/86304982.cms||Manka Behl
---||Puducherry||BJP plans to field candidate for Rajya Sabha seat in Puducherry||PUDUCHERRY: The Puducherry BJP unit made its intentions clear on Friday and declared that the party would field its candidate for the lone Rajya Sabha seat under the National Democratic Alliance in the Union territory. The party went a step further and urged its alliance partner All India NR Congress (AINRC) to extend support to the party’s candidate for the polls. The term of Rajya Sabha MP N Gokulakrishnan (AIADMK) expires on October 6. Nomination for the lone RS seat, which commenced on September 15, will close on September 22 and polls, if necessitated, will be held on October 4. The Puducherry unit of the saffron party convened its legislators’ meeting on Friday in which the party ministers, elected and nominated members and independent MLAs, who extended their support to the party, participated and deliberated on the Rajya Sabha seat. The meeting resolved to field the party’s candidate under NDA and urge AINRC founder leader and chief minister N Rangasamy, who also leads the NDA in Puducherry, to extend support to the party’s candidate. The local BJP leaders were, however, tight-lipped on the party’s candidate. Speculations are rife that former Tamil Nadu BJP president L Murugan, who lost the 2021 assembly polls to DMK's N Kayalvizhi in Dharapuram but was inducted as the Union minister of state for information and broadcasting was likely to be the party’s candidate for RS seat in Puducherry. “The BJP party with maximum representation in the assembly has decided to field its candidate under NDA. We have six elected members and three nominated members,” said BJP legislature party leader and home minister A Namassivayam, adding that the three independent members too backed the party. The Puducherry assembly has 30 elected and three nominated members. Moreover, three independent MLAs have pledged their support to the BJP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/puducherry/bjp-plans-to-field-candidate-for-rajya-sabha-seat-in-puducherry/articleshow/86309772.cms||Bosco Dominique
---||Nagpur||More Nagpur minors involved in murders than Mumbai, Pune: NCRB data||Nagpur: National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB)’s 2020 crime statistics reveal that more minors from Nagpur were involved in murders (nine) than from Mumbai (five) or Pune (eight). Though there is a decline in the overall number of minors in criminal activities — known as ‘juveniles in conflict with law’ in legal parlance of the Juvenile Justice Act — their involvement in certain types of offences has still kept cops on their toes. As per NCRB’s latest data, while Mumbai had most minors accused in different crimes (overall) in the state in 2020, Nagpur had more juveniles in crime than Pune in 2019 and 2020, despite the former having lesser population. In 2019, Pune had 299 minors in crime as compared to Nagpur's 369. In 2020, Nagpur had 274 minors named in different crimes as compared to 243 in Pune. In theft cases, 102 minors were named as accused in Nagpur in 2020, while Mumbai had 63 and Pune 39. In burglary category, 19 minors were named as accused in Nagpur while 15 in Mumbai and 12 in Pune. Similarly, Nagpur had 18 minors named in robberies while Pune had 18. City police chief (CP) Amitesh Kumar said bringing down the number of minors in crime is a top priority for the police department, with regular counselling for juveniles and their parents at various camps being held for this purpose. “We have been urging the parents to ensure minors are engaged in education or other constructive activities. At citizen-police committee meetings, I have been been apprising parents of the need to keep minors under watch and monitor their activities,” Kumar said, adding that there had been a positive impact of the efforts taken by the police to quell involvement of minors in crime. Former CP BK Upadhyay had undertaken an initiative under CARE programme in which he ensured that the social service branch (SSB) dedicatedly addressed the issue of minors committing crimes, and keep a tab on their activities with a positive mindset. “We used to organize different events and programmes involving the minors who were involved in crimes,” he said. Another erstwhile CP Praveen Dixit said he had engaged Matrusewa Sangh and Rotary Club to conduct counselling of minors in crime and tried to bring them back into the mainstream of society. “Dropping out from schools and higher education has been a reason behind their involvement in crime. The society should not abandon minors but take them into its fold, and strive for their reformation and rehabilitation with police playing the role of a catalyst, as the data of such people is with the department,” Dixit said. District child protection officer Mushtaq Pathan of women and child development department said the minors in crime are lodged at the observation home where their skill development, counselling and such reformation exercises are being encouraged. “Probationary officers visit the residences of minors who were named in different crimes, and prepare their social audit reports. They are being rehabilitated accordingly as per a plan,” Pathan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/more-nagpur-minors-involved-in-murders-than-mumbai-pune-ncrb-data/articleshow/86305119.cms||Soumitra Bose

On Thursday, Sakkardara, Lakadganj, Pachpaoli, Ganeshpeth, Kapil Nagar and Imambada police stations had organized mahaprasad and invited local residents, various committee members, peoples’ representatives, ‘police mitras’ or citizen volunteers and other personalities. Sources said mayor Dayashankar Tiwari visited the Ganeshpeth police station to meet the cops and active members of the police committees. Through the mahaprasad initiative, the city police also looked at building informer base and support group among the citizens who work as interface between the cops and society during a crisis. The cops ensured Covid norms were followed and an informal interaction was held among the limited invitees comprising people from different communities, beliefs and socio-economic background. City police chief Amitesh Kumar, who had asked the police stations to follow Covid norms while organizing the mahaprasad, said the occasion served the purpose of building an ambience of communal harmony. “I tried to get fair feedback from the invitees about policing and address their grievances. Such interactions develop mutual understanding between police and public,” said the CP who attended the programmes at Ganeshpeth, Pachpaoli and Imambada police stations. Senior inspector Amol Deshmukh of Kapil Nagar police station was optimistic about the outcome after people from different communities and background participated in the mahaprasad there. Senior inspector Sanjay Mendhe said Covid norms were strictly enforced with “polite reminders” to the invitees. “Selected and active members of Mohalla (neighbourhood), Shantata (peace) and Dakshata (vigilance) committees, who had been meeting police separately, came together on a common platform to freely interact with us,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cops-hold-community-feasts-on-ganeshotsav-to-bond-with-citizens/articleshow/86305168.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Kolkata||West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee, not Rahul Gandhi, only alternative to PM Narendra Modi, says Trinamool mouthpiece||KOLKATA: Trinamool Congress mouthpiece ‘Jago Bangla’ on Friday front-paged a lead article saying Rahul Gandhi hasn’t succeeded and Mamata Banerjee was the only alternative to Narendra Modi. The article — quoting party seniors, including TMC’s Lok Sabha leader Sudip Bandyopadhyay, speaking at a closed-door party conference on Wednesday — said while Congress was integral to the opposition bloc, Rahul didn’t succeed to emerge as Modi’s alternative despite several chances. Trinamool will start a campaign with Mamata as Modi’s alternative, the article said. The daily quoted Bandyopadhyay as saying at the meeting that the nation needed an alternative. “I have known Rahul Gandhi for long. But I am forced to say that he has failed to emerge as a viable alternative to Narendra Modi. The entire country now wants Mamata (Banerjee). We will speak to all opposition parties and project Mamata Banerjee as the alternative,” he said. Speaking to TOI, Bandopadhyay said: “Whatever I had to say I have done it at the party workers’ conference at University Institute Hall on September 15. It’s my personal opinion that has been published in the party paper. I have nothing to add to it.” Bandyopadhyay added that his words reflected his assessment after talking to a cross-section of people on the sidelines of his visits to four states over the last month as part of parliamentary standing committee teams. “They feel Mamata Banerjee can steer the nation,” he said. This, however, didn’t come as a surprise. Eleven days ago, emerging out of a nine-hour ED questioning at its Delhi office, TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee interestingly had singled out Congress when he said Trinamool will take on BJP head-on, and unlike others (mentioning Congress specifically once) will not “sell their spines or hide in homes”. Even before Parliament’s monsoon session, Trinamool floor leaders in the Lok Sabha, Bandyopadhyay and its leader in Rajya Sabha Derek O’Brien didn’t attend any opposition meeting convened by Rahul. The party had, instead, sent its MPs. Reasoning why TMC chose to skip some opposition meetings, party MP Saugata Roy had said, “The Trinamool supremo had espoused the need for all parties opposed to BJP’s divisive and communal politics to come together. TMC believes in opposition unity. But it isn’t axiomatic that there will always be a joint approach, it will be merit-based. We have made our position clear both inside and outside Parliament.” Roy had added that TMC stood on a different footing, having fought and defeated BJP on its own in Bengal. TMC isn’t the only party that has questioned Congress. NCP leader Sharad Pawar had a week ago remarked on the Congress as “zamindars who can’t control their havelis”. On August 20, Mamata had stressed at a virtual meeting of 19 opposition parties that parties who were not allied to Congress should also be part of the opposition bloc against BJP. Her statement came in the backdrop of several regional parties either choosing to skip the meeting or were not invited. According to sources, parties that were either not invited or chose to give the two-and-a-half-hour meeting a miss were BSP, AAP, MiM and parties opposed to Congress like TRS, BJD and YSR Congress.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/mamata-not-rahul-only-alternative-to-modi-says-trinamool-mouthpiece/articleshow/86304845.cms||---
---||Mumbai||As companies quote 30% less, BMC likely to scrap road tenders||MUMBAI: A leaked internal file noting of BMC shows the civic body admitting to compromised execution of Mumbai’s road works. Recently, BMC tenders for new road works in the city had contractors bid 26-30% below the actual cost of around Rs 1,200 crore. BMC is likely to scrap all the tenders and call short ones, which will now delay works that would otherwise have begun next month. A senior official said they would not mind delaying the works by a month instead of having to take up bad quality works that will be a permanent liability. TimesViewThis seems to be an old modus operandi of road contractors. Quote below the official estimate and grab the contract by hook or by crook. This is why Mumbai’s road construction quality is so shoddy and inferior. The additional commissioner has rightly red-flagged the bids. It must review the contract and invite fresh tenders without wasting time.Additional municipal commissioner P Velrasu, in a note before the civic roads department this week, said the rate analysis is unlikely to justify the possibility of doing proper quality of road works. ‘How will bidders maintain quality of road works?’Velrasu also asked the department when rebates range from 26% to 30%, a question arises whether the work will be done according to the standards prescribed in the tender document. Further, he has said the rate analysis won’t justify the possibility of doing proper quality work at such high rebate rates. The department has been asked to justify how the quality of road works would be maintained by bidders in case they are subcontracted and also if any mechanism has been put in place to ensure the cement mixture used for the road works is of good quality. Recounting the earlier road department enquiries in the letter, Velrasu has said that they had highlighted compromised execution of road works with poor quality. “With this background the department has to explain how it intends to maintain the quality under control, in spite of bidders bidding at very high rebate levels. The road works are tested to the extent of only 5-10% by senior road engineers. When 100% road work supervision is not possible, how will the quality of execution be ensured,” stated the note, a copy of which is with TOI. “The price of neither cement nor labour has reduced, so it is difficult to understand on what basis such low rates are quoted. A reply from the department is expected shortly based on which a decision on scrapping the existing tenders is likely to be taken and a short tender will be floated,” he said. MLA and corporator Rais Shaikh said there has been no capacity building of the BMC’s in-house engineers ever due to which supervision of any road works taken up by the BMC has been very lax. Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis, in a letter to the civic chief sent on September 11, has stated the BMC has not learnt lessons from the road scam and pointed towards “abnormally” low rates by bidders which will compromise the quality of the works.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/as-companies-quote-30-less-bmc-likely-to-scrap-road-tenders/articleshow/86309822.cms||Richa Pinto
---||India||SC frowns on unnecessary litigations, imposes fine||NEW DELHI: In an important decision to discourage needless and unnecessary litigations, particularly in corporate matters where companies with deep pockets fight legal battles, the Supreme Court on Friday said a fine must be imposed and the amount should be money spent by the target of such litigation by way of case and lawyer fees. A bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hrishikesh Roy said that the judiciary must shed its "hesitancy" in imposing costs on parties for misusing the judicial process and those who abuse the system must face the consequences. The bench was particularly concerned over the corporates misusing judicial platforms for settling scores against rivals and said that the erring party should pay a cost to its rival for dragging it to litigation. Settling the principles on calculating cost to be imposed on a party, the bench said it is necessary that in commercial litigation, commercial interests be weighed, which would include consequences of the matter not receiving favourable consideration by the courts. "The best reflection of what costs have been incurred is what the parties have paid towards the counsel fee and out of pocket expenses," the bench said. The court passed the verdict while imposing a cost of around Rs 31 lakh on two companies who had challenged a Tamil Nadu government decision to award a tender for production and supply of polyester based hologram excise labels to their rival. The rival will be reimbursed 50% of costs he incurred. The companies had filed a PIL in Madras HC which had quashed the government decision, compelling the firm to move to Supreme Court. Senior advocates, Ranjit Kumar and Amit Anand Tiwari, appearing for the state, told the bench that the two companies had not even participated in the tender process and their filing PIL was an abuse of process of law. "Mindless appeals should not be the rule. We are conscious that in the given facts of the case the respondents have succeeded before the Division Bench though they failed before the learned single Judge. Suffice to say that all the parties before us are financially strong and took a commercial decision to carry this legal battle right up to this Court. They must, thus, face the consequences and costs of success or failure in the present proceedings," the bench said, accepting the contentions of the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-frowns-on-unnecessary-litigations-imposes-fine/articleshow/86309837.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary
---||Goa||Goa govt brings village tourism into focus||PANAJI: The state government has notified the Tourist Villages Development Scheme 2021 for setting up infrastructure in rural areas through village panchayats with the objective of creating “a village tourism circuit that acts as an independent and strong tourism product”, to attract “responsible” visitors. Funds up to Rs 50 lakh will be allocated to a selected village to develop infrastructure like kiosks for sale of local products, arts, crafts, multi-utility hall for organising local fairs and festivals, home stays, Wi-Fi and solar streetlights, among others. Financial support over and above this amount in a financial year will be decided by the tourism department depending on the availability of funds. The tourism department will not transfer or disburse funds directly to any village panchayat. The scheme is part of the state government’s economic revival plan to make villages self-reliant under the ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat, Swayampoorna Goa’ initiative launched by the chief minister on October 1, 2020. A selection committee will be tasked with choosing villages for development based on various factors such as demographics, socio-economy, availability of natural attractions and heritage sites, prevalence of arts and crafts, cuisine, Goan music and folk dances among other potential tourism elements. The committee will comprise secretary tourism, director tourism, managing director of Goa Tourism Development Corporation and the Travel and Tourism Association of Goa besides two experts appointed by the tourism department. The tourism department or its associates or any reputed third-party appointed by it, will identify the list of works, allocate a budget and undertake necessary works. The selection committee, at its discretion, will then allocate a suitable budget for the works. The village panchayat will have to submit an undertaking stating that it will maintain and manage the facilities developed under the project as also bear all incremental expenditure. As reported by TOI earlier this month, villages will be selected under individual themes with scope to add other themes depending on their tourism potential. These include fishing, heritage, spiritual, agriculture, feni trails, adventure, nature expedition, and wellness among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-brings-village-tourism-into-focus/articleshow/86305744.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Chennai||Cases booked for circulating fake news double in Tamil Nadu in 2020||CHENNAI: The number of cases booked for circulating false/fake news and rumours in Tamil Nadu doubled in 2020 over the previous year, shows National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data. In 2020, 188 cases were booked in TN under section 505 IPC (r/w IT act), the second highest after Telangana with 273 cases. TN also had 12 % of total cases booked in the country. In 2019, 91 TN accounted for the most such cases in the country. The numbers might be minuscule, but such fake news can create ripples, especially during a pandemic. In 2020, the Erode district administration slapped the Goondas act against two college students for spreading fake news about Covid spread in a village. In Vellore, three youths were booked for spreading misinformation. A senior police officer said that while these instances of overzealous teens spreading rumours could at least be contained, influential personalities with a huge following in social media spreading false information can spark panic. ‘Healer’ Baskar, a popular YouTuber arrested by the Coimbatore police in March 2020 for spreading rumours about Covid, had earlier run-ins with the authorities over his unscientific claims, but circulating an audio clip alleging conspiracies by the government in the precautionary steps against Covid-19 created fear. In Chennai, Thanikasalam who ran a Siddha hospital near Koyambedu was arrested for claiming to have found a herbal cure for Covid-19 and spreading the message through his social media pages. Fake news impacts policing too. “...Lot of motivated information and fake news diverts the attention of police and they end up firefighting where there is no fire,” said R Nataraj, former director general of police.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/cases-booked-for-circulating-fake-news-double-in-tamil-nadu-in-2020/articleshow/86309813.cms||Srikkanth D
---||Goa||75 yrs after freedom, citizens still lack basic needs: Guv||Panaji: Governor P S Sreedharan Pillai on Friday said that even after 74 years of Independence, the country is yet to to provide basic minimum requirement to its citizens, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a systematic way is working towards achieving a “fully satisfied India”. Speaking at a private function held at Kadamba Plateau on Friday, the governor said, “Our country is known for its unique traditions and cultures, including the concept of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’ which are being followed till today. That is why India is considered a wonderful country.” “There are so many religious communities that include Hindus, Muslims and Christians, diverse languages, lifestyle and food habits, dress codes, etc, but despite this, we can see unity everywhere. No religion, language or regionalism can unite India. Our country exists on the basis of the desire for unity, and that is why sovereignty and democracy is the cornerstone of our nation, despite the difference of opinions,” the governor said. The governor said that every citizen is entitled to basic minimum requirement. “The minimum requirement for citizens is food, air, amenities and health facilities. But after 74 years of Independence we have not fully achieved it,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/75-yrs-after-freedom-citizens-still-lack-basic-needs-guv/articleshow/86305782.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||‘Country needs to speed up justice delivery system in corruption cases’||For the last seven years central agencies such as the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) have become active in taking action against corrupt and unscrupulous bureaucrats, politicians and businessmen. A noticeable feature in these actions is attachment of properties till the judiciary convicts the accused. At the state-level, the anti-corruption bureau and vigilance department take similar action against state government employees and local politicians. Acquittal of Chhagan Bhujbal and Kripashankar Singh from the allegation of disproportionate assets and A Raja from the telecom scam by lower courts after prolonged investigation and court trial process gives rise to doubts about the quality of investigation and capability of investigation officers. Opposition leaders claiming that the government is vindictively targeting politicians from their parties is a general allegation. Action by the investigation agencies starts after a complaint is filed against the accused along with prima facie proof by some person or organisation. There are corrupt politicians in the ruling party also. Opposition parties and their sympathisers can always file complaints against such persons. However, the policy of ‘teri bhi chup aur meri bhi chup’ is followed by all, across party lines, as per each one’s convenience. In most cases, the investigation, filing of chargesheet, court trial and judgment takes a minimum five to 10 years. The appeal process till the Supreme Court takes another 15 to 20 years. Arrest of corrupt investigating officers of CBI and ED in the recent past is a welcome move. Investigation and conviction of such cases after action being initiated cannot and should not take more than three years. There are several reasons for delay in investigation and conviction. For one, the investigating team should be given a time limit during which the team should not be changed. Also, right from day one, the investigating team must be provided assistance from financial and tax professionals. In the absence of such assistance, the team wastes time and energy in collecting and interpreting irrelevant documents. The team should also be given assistance of tax professionals for analysis and interpretation of financial transactions and source of income of the accused through which the ill-gotten wealth has been acquired. Mere disclosure of income under the Income Tax Act, GST and other applicable laws cannot be interpreted as a valid source of income. Investigating the source of income is important. Acquittal of the accused on technical grounds should be stopped. If in the course of investigation and trial the judiciary finds that other relevant acts are applicable, then the same must be applied. These and many more suggestions may be considered by law makers and the judiciary for speedy justice because justice delayed is justice denied.

The 24-year-old woman from Shirdona was on her way to Margao after celebrating Ganesh Chaturthi. She was also carrying a small purse with spare change which she kept in the bag during transit. As a result, she had left behind the bag as well as her purse that was in the bag. The bus’ driver and conductor, Rajesh Upaskar and Mangesh Naik, noticed the unattended bag after the bus reached the Margao bus stand and alerted the depot about the same. The bag was handed to the traffic controller at the KTC Margao depot, and from there, the bag was sent to the Panaji depot at the KTC Panaji bus terminus. Meanwhile, the woman returned to the Margao depot to ask about her lost belongings. She was sent to the Panaji depot and was directed to collect it from there. She later thanked Upaskar and Naik for returning her belongings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/ktc-staff-returns-forgotten-bag-with-jewellery/articleshow/86305913.cms||---

He said that the Mapusa Municipal Council (MMC) had requested for the same and that it had been approved. The minister said that before Covid-induced restrictions came into force, Mapusa generated around 35 to 40 tonne of wet waste, but this is now down to 20 tonne despite which even 50% collection was not happening. Additionally, whatever is collected is not treated, but dumped. There is not a single panchayat or municipality that is treating garbage, he added. There is a lot of manpower with the MMC for waste collection, but the work is not happening properly, and a lot of wet waste is seen dumped at many places around the town, he said. “We have given permission for five tonnes and can even increase it to 10, but the council must properly utilise the manpower to collect dry and wet waste as all the workers are getting salaries,” Lobo said. He said that the municipality should also seek advice from a waste management department engineer and if required an engineer could be sent to train the council’s workers in waste management, but first, the council must show its willingness to solve the garbage problem.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/waste-corp-to-collect-5-tonne-wet-garbage-from-mapusa/articleshow/86305994.cms||---

A source close to the development said that the move may ultimately lead to a manufacturer-distributor-retailer model by doing away with the role of Bevco. The transition, set to be implemented from October 18 this year, is unlikely to have any impact on the end-user as the super distributors would be getting the margin of profit previously drawn by Bevco. The state excise directorate on Thursday notified the government’s decision to grant the licence and called for submission of applications from interested parties. However, not everyone can apply for the licence, it said. Business entities having a minimum five years of experience in wholesale distribution of liquor in any state/UT in India along with a liquor distribution turnover of at least Rs 150 crore every year for the last three financial years can apply for the same. Set up in January 2017 as a wholly owned and controlled PSU under the state finance department with an aim to tackle the menace of spurious/illicit/non-duty paid alcohol, Bevco began procurement of bottled spirits from all liquor manufacturers and suppliers situated outside the state and selling the same to all Bengal-based retailers by 2018. However, retailers had many complaints against Bevco ranging from damage to pilferage of products during transportation of bottles and cartons. “We had been raising complaints about it for a long time. The supplies from Bevco were erratic and often we ended up getting a lesser amount of products against what we had paid for. A number of bottles got damaged or stolen in the process and cartons were found ripped in some cases,” said a retailer in central Kolkata. With Bevco, retailers said, they had to deal with a group of middlemen, who used to control the supply and transportation network. “These third-party personnel were difficult to handle. The new system will hopefully help us interact directly with the distributors,” said another retailer. Excise duty on alcohol is the third-largest source of tax revenues for the state clocking a whopping Rs 20,000 crore revenue per year. The provisions of the notification, however, will not be applicable to Murshidabad and Kolkata (south) till the time the Election Commission’s model code of conduct is in force for upcoming bypolls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/super-distributors-to-replace-bevco-in-bengal-liquor-biz/articleshow/86306047.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Citizens were quick to raise an alarm, and after questioning the driver on what he had just done they reported the matter to assistant director enforcement (North) Jack De Souza who later sent his enforcement team and booked the driver. “Once the frequency of passengers increases on the bus stand, incidents like these can be very dangerous. There is no personnel on the bus stand from any agency to monitor the behaviour of bus drivers, nor are there any CCTV cameras at the bus stand. Senior citizens and tourists especially are at risk when a bus suddenly moves in a direction other than the one assigned,” said coordinator of Goa Consumer Action Network (Goacan), Roland Martins. Goacan has decided to write to the director of transport, SP Traffic, Kadamba Transport Corporation Ltd (KTC), CCP commissioner and North Goa district collector about the incident that occurred on September 15, and the similarities of what happened on February 17, 2018, wherein a city bus coming from the wrong direction crushed five people at the Panaji bus stand, leaving two dead and three injured. “There must be some sort of protocol put in place to ensure that there is proper movement of buses on the bus stand,” Martins said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/pvt-bus-fined-for-driving-in-opposite-direction-at-panaji/articleshow/86306077.cms||---

The polls are over and so is the relevance of the Morcha. However, candidates for seats where by-elections are due will fight as decided earlier,” Yechury said, drawing a reference to how the Janata Party floated to defeat Indira Gandhi didn’t exist after the elections were over. The CPM leader also took a dig at the BJP-led central government on the PM’s 71st birthday, saying it had failed on the vaccination front. “India is behind 113 countries as data available from the Covid World Vaccination Tracker. The report has come when it is being said that India is running the largest vaccination programme.” Yechury demanded that the vaccination programme be accelerated. “Our target was to achieve 8 crore double-dose vaccination by the end of December. We are far from the target. The BJP is celebrating the PM’s birthday for three weeks. Thousands of crores are being spent on propaganda and publicity instead of on distribution of free food and direct cash transfers,” he said. The CPM, along with 19 parties, will launch protests from September 20 against the “loot of public money” in the garb of restructuring “bad loans”. The party at its Bengal committee meeting on Friday decided that its state conference would be held in Kolkata from February 19 to 21.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/relevance-of-morcha-over-with-polls-yechury/articleshow/86304983.cms||---
---||Kolkata||BJP uses PM Narendra Modi birthday to drum up support for Tibrewal||KOLKATA: The BJP’s organisers in Bhowanipore pulled out all the stops on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s 71st birthday on Friday to maximise voter outreach and ensure a good bypoll turnout on September 30. Party functions were hosted at Uriapara, Camac Street and Girish Mukherjee Road while BJP candidate Priyanka Tibrewal visited voters at high-rises under the constituency. She began the day with a Facebook post to wish the country’s “strongest PM” and later hopped Vishwakarma Puja pandals to greet everyone with a namaste. “We held ‘seva’ and ‘samarpan’ programmes at eight to 10 places in wards 63, 70 and 71. In ward 63, we distributed rice, pulses and edible oil among rickshaw-pullers and labourers. Laddoos were distributed at other places,” said BJP state committee member Naveen Mishra. Party veterans such as Barrackpore MP Arjun Singh, who was present at the Uriapara function, ensured that Tibrewal stayed away from ‘seva’ programmes and did not incur the Election Commission’s wrath for flouting the model code of conduct. “We did not invite the candidate to these programmes. Only partymen distributed seva articles among the people,” said Mishra. Two days ago, the EC had show-caused Tibrewal for allegedly violating Covid guidelines to campaign. Bengal BJP leaders also attended several programmes across the state to revamp the mandal-level organisation, which suffered a major erosion after the assembly polls earlier this year. State party president Dilip Ghosh, along with BJP leader Rahul Sinha, inaugurated a health camp and another for blood in Hooghly’s Arambagh. At Nandigram’s Reyapara, leader of the opposition Suvendu Adhikari distributed 71 shankhas (conch shells) and puja utensils, besides books and other stationery items among 71 students. “We are celebrating PM Modi’s birthday through ‘seva’. The country is in strong hands as it should be. Afghanistan is a glaring example of what can happen to a country if its leader is weak; it ends in ruins. Fortunately, India is in the strongest of hands,” he said. To sum it up, the state leadership used the BJP’s official social media handle to upload a virtual exhibition on Modi’s life and work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bjp-uses-modi-bday-to-drum-up-support-for-bhowanipore-candidate/articleshow/86305116.cms||Rohit Khanna

A division bench of Justice Subrata Talukdar and Justice Kaseng Doma Bhutia gave the education board chief a relief window till October 4 with the directive that he give full marks to the 19 petitioners who had attempted the six flawed questions in TET-2014. Justice Samapti Chatterjee had in 2018 directed the board to do the same. The division bench also asked Bhattacharya to ensure that the 19 petitioners got a fair chance at recruitment in state-run primary schools if they were found eligible after the marks review. Earlier this month, a single bench of Justice Abhijit Gangopadhyay had imposed a fine on the board chairman, ordering him to pay “from his own pocket” Rs 20,000 to each of the petitioners for violating the 2018 court order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tet-case-hc-relief-for-bengal-edu-board-chief-with-riders/articleshow/86304904.cms||Subrata Chattoraj
---||Kolkata||VB slaps show-cause on suspended teacher||Santiniketan: Visva-Bharati economics teacher Sudipta Bhattacharya, who has been under suspension since January, was served a show-cause notice on Thursday evening for allegedly “instigating” students protesting in front of the vice-chancellor’s residence against rustication of three of their peers. Calcutta High Court had on Wednesday set aside the rustication order. “You are reported to have instigated a group of students while they were agitating near the residence of the VC to undertake vandalism, seize the VC’s residence, disrupt the normal activities of the university and other unlawful activities (sic),” the notice read. He has been asked to reply within three days. Bhattacharya and a few other teachers had joined the students who had sat on a dharna from August 27 outside the VC’s residence, demanding withdrawal of the rustication order. The teacher, who has already moved court against his prolonged suspension, said the allegations against him were baseless. “I will reply within the given time frame,” he said. Meanwhile, the varsity held a press conference on Friday to cite lack of regional diversity, faculty-student ratio and intellectual property rights as reasons behind its not-so-stellar NIRF rank. Vice-chancellor Bidyut Chakraborty and officiating registrar Ashok Mahato were present at the meet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vb-slaps-show-cause-on-suspended-teacher/articleshow/86304895.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||Plaints pour in against banks at student credit card review meeting||Kolkata: Complaints against private banks, roped in for Bengal’s flagship student credit card scheme, swamped a review meeting convened by state chief secretary H K Dwivedi with district magistrates and other senior officials on Friday. The fact that several banks were asking for collateral security from students, even when the government was the guarantor, defeated the very purpose of the credit card scheme, officials told Dwivedi. Some said farmers too were facing hurdles when approaching nationalised banks for opening accounts. It is learnt that the chief secretary will soon convene a meeting with private banks on the matter. The unique credit card scheme, part of Trinamool Congress’ poll promises, is meant to help underprivileged students pursue higher studies. It offers an education loan of up to Rs 10 lakh at a nominal interest rate, which depends on the term of repayment. After PNB became the lead bank to sign an MoU with the state on the scheme, chief minister Mamata Banerjee had categorically asked that students should not face any problem while seeking loans. She had directed education secretary Manish Jain to personally monitor the scheme. Education department officials have apprised top bureaucrats that students were facing issues in securing collateral-free loans. Private banks are allegedly demanding various types of security from parents, including mortgage of land deed or submission of an equivalent amount as fixed deposit. Several students have registered their plaints with district officials after the CMO launched a grievance redress cell. Dwivedi started a series of review meetings since September 13 for feedback on various state projects and schemes. Finance officials said they had informed private banks about the student credit card scheme and the message was given at the state-level bankers’ committee meeting too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/plaints-pour-in-against-banks-at-student-credit-card-review-meeting/articleshow/86304839.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu, Kerala to set up panels on water disputes||CHENNAI: The Tamil Nadu and Kerala governments on Friday agreed to set up technical sub-committees to assess the Nirar-Nallar multipurpose straight-cut scheme to avoid a long circuitous route and convey water from Upper Nirar to river Nallar. The discussions included building a new dam under Pandiyar-Punnampuzha project to divert water to Noyyal and Bhavani basin in Tamil Nadu. This was one of the decisions taken during a bilateral talk between the secretaries of water resources of both states through video-conference. “The meeting was very positive. Kerala government officials suggested having next round of talks between ministers or chief ministers in Chennai,” Tamil Nadu PWD secretary Sandeep Saxena said. The Kerala government on Friday gave in-principle approval to divert 2.5tmcft of water from Anamalayar, which formed part of the original Parambikulam-Aliyar Project, and the long-pending demand of the Tamil Nadu government. The proposed technical sub-committee will look into the Anamalayar project as well. The Tamil Nadu government had suggested a new location for the construction of dam under Pandiyar-Punnampuzha project. This will control floods to a certain extent in river Chaliyar of Kerala. “Kerala has given in-principle nod to the project,” Saxena said. Both sides are interested in generating power from the project. Kerala has raised the issue of safety of Mullaperiyar dam to which the TN government replied that the state was taking all steps as per Supreme Court order. Kerala wanted a new dam as there was fear among those in downstream areas. On the TN government’s request to remove 23 trees downstream of Baby dam in Mullaperiyar dam, which is part of the strengthening work as per the court orders, the principal secretary of environment and forests and principal conservator of forests, Kerala, said the process was on to get the clearance from state wildlife board.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-kerala-to-set-up-panels-on-water-disputes/articleshow/86309924.cms||Julie Mariappan
---||Kolkata||West Bengal to add 435 child intensive care beds||KOLKATA: The state health department has decided to increase the number of PICU (paediatric intensive care unit) beds further before the possible third wave. Earlier, the department had sanctioned 244 PICU beds across 21 hospitals. Health officials now have decided to augment the paediatric Covid-19 facilities by adding 435 more PICU beds, almost double of what had been initially planned. In addition, Swasthya Bhavan has also told two hospitals to keep 90 NICU (newborn intensive care units) beds ready for tending to affected infants. While 80 NICU beds will be kept ready at IPGMER (SSKM) Hospital, 10 other such beds will be set up at Murshidabad Medical College. “It may please be borne in mind that these units are to be made functional within a very short period of time to combat the probable surge in Covid-19 cases. Thus, all civil, electrical and medical oxygen pipeline work should be completed at the earliest,” said the order from the health department on Friday. State’s referral hospital for children, Dr BC Roy Post Graduate Institute of Paediatric Sciences (DBCRPGIPS), will have the highest number of PICU beds. In addition to the initially sanctioned 24 PICU beds, the hospital has been asked to add 72 more PICU beds. “The additional 72 beds will come up on our second campus in Beliaghata while 24 others are getting ready on our main campus,” said DBCRPGIPS principal Dilip Pal. “The second wave surge was sudden and huge leaving the healthcare system overwhelmed. It is a great move that our health department is constantly upgrading facilities. We are augmenting our facilities in sync with plans by health officials,” said Chittaranjan Seva Sadan (CSS) principal Ashish Mukhopadhyay. While CSS is ready with 24 PICU beds, the hospital has to add 12 more such beds, which, the principal said should be ready in about two weeks. “This kind of preparedness is of utmost necessary to combat any public health emergency related to children. At the same time, this kind of decentralization of facilities by the health department will be beneficial for local people,” said Swasthya Bhavan public health specialist Anirban Dalui.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/state-to-add-435-child-intensive-care-beds/articleshow/86303222.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Lucknow||23 lakh vaccine shots given in Uttar Pradesh against 2.2 crore doses nationwide||LUCKNOW: One in ten persons to have taken the Covid-19 vaccine across the country in India’s record bid to vaccinate two crore people to mark Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s birthday was from Uttar Pradesh. According to data from the CoWin portal, more than 2.22 crore doses of the vaccine were administered across the country on Friday. Of these, 23 lakh doses or over 10% were given in Uttar Pradesh alone. With this, the total number of doses administered in UP reached 9.30 crore. In terms of people, 7.69 crore people in UP have taken at least one dose, while 1.60 crore are fully vaccinated. Lucknow, Prayagraj, Ghaziabad, Aligarh and Agra were among the top five districts to have contributed during the day. But cumulatively, Lucknow, Ghaziabad, Prayagraj, Gorakhpur and Gautam Budh Nagar remained the best performers. Health officials reiterated that the Covid-19 vaccine was the best line of defence against the pandemic virus and urged people to shun their fears and come forward and take their due dose. They cited that of the total 7.69 crore people to have taken the vaccine, a miniscule 0.002% have experienced any kind of adverse effect after immunisation. Experts lauded the push being given to the Covid-19 vaccination in the state. They, however, said that there was a need to encourage those due for the second-dose to take their dose. They also reminded that vaccination along with adherence to the Covid-19 appropriate behaviour was the best way to beat the pandemic virus. Meanwhile, 17 new cases in the past 24 hours took the state’s tally to 17,09,643. Of the total, 16,86,565 have recovered while 22,887 have died. This speaks for a recovery rate of 98.7% and a death rate of 1.3%. A look at the official Covid-19 bulletin indicated that the state is left with just 191 active cases in 40 districts. This means that the remaining 35 districts are free from coronavirus infection. Also, 46% of the active cases belonged to just five districts namely Lucknow (24), Bareilly (21), Prayagraj (19), Gorakhpur (14) and Gautam Budh Nagar (11). The bulletin also showed that the new cases were reported from 11 districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/23-lakh-vaccine-shots-given-in-uttar-pradesh-against-2-2-crore-doses-nationwide/articleshow/86309996.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Kolkata||Trinamool Congress national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee, wife Rujira move Delhi HC against ED||KOLKATA: Trinamool Congress national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee and his wife Rujira moved Delhi High Court on Friday seeking to quash the fresh ED summons asking him to appear at Enforcement Directorate’s (ED) Khan Market offices of Head Investigative Unit (HIU) on September 21. The couple has also sought the Delhi HC’s intervention to stop ED from issuing summons asking them to appear in Delhi for a case lodged in Bengal where ED already has a zonal office. Abhishek and Rujira told the court that they have been asked to submit voluminous documents spanning the last 10 years relating to them, their families, finances, assets, foreign visits in connection with an FIR which was lodged in November 2020. Abhishek and Rujira have also told the Delhi HC that while they have been repeatedly summoned, they have not been provided any details on the complaints against them or whether they were being asked to appear as witnesses or accused. They alleged that ED being a government body under the Union finance ministry “cannot be allowed to operate in secrecy or in an arbitrary and highhanded manner”. In the petition, Abhishek alleged that he had appeared for a nine-hour long questioning by the ED in New Delhi and “was questioned at length and asked various intrusive and personal questions”. He alleged that the questions asked “had nothing to do with the investigation”. Dubbing the questioning as a “roving and unguided inquiry” into his personal and “political affairs”, he alleged that this brought into question the “legitimacy of the process and the fairness of the investigation being carried out”. Abhishek said CBI lodged the FIR in the illegal coal mining scam on November 28, 2020. ED lodged the case the very next day. But the agency, which has issued him several summons, has not shared the case details with him or his wife. He also alleged that based on statements which appeared in legal documents given to the court by the ED and in media statements attributed to ED officers, it appeared that they have already made up their mind that he was “one of the beneficiaries” and was “trying to derail the probe”. Abhishek said his name didn’t figure in the FIR lodged by the CBI. He said given the backdrop, he was not even aware if the questioning would be used against him subsequently. Abhishek argued that he could not be asked to be a witness against himself and violate his fundamental rights under Article 20(3) of the Constitution. Earlier, the ED had also moved Delhi HC seeking to quash summons against its officers asked to appear for questioning by the Kalighat police in an FIR lodged by Abhishek on April 3.-||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/abhishek-rujira-move-delhi-hc-against-ed/articleshow/86304856.cms||Subrata Chattoraj
---||Kolkata||West Bengal to bar costly cancer drug use in Swasthya Sathi||KOLKATA: The Bengal government is set to issue a guideline to private hospitals, barring certain high-value cancer drugs under Swasthya Sathi. The development comes a little over a month-and-a-half since TOI first highlighted reports of misuse of the flagship scheme through over-prescription of expensive cancer medicines. An experts’ committee, set up by the health department to look into over-prescription, has compiled a list of some costly cancer drugs which would be barred from being pushed on Swasthya Sathi patients. These chemotherapy and immunology drugs can exhaust the entire coverage amount — Rs 5 lakh — in days, thus affecting further treatment of the patient under the scheme. “According to experts, these are not life-saving drugs, but second- and third-line drugs,” said a state health official, adding, “Prescribing such medicines means Swasthya Sathi patients would be left with no fund for further treatment after two to three cycles of chemotherapy. The experts’ committee felt that most of the drugs were not at all essential.” After the TOI report at the beginning of August, the government had constituted the experts’ committee — comprising some highly experienced oncologists, radiation oncologists, onco-surgeons and haematologists from hospitals across the city — after getting a whiff that some doctors were over-prescribing high-molecule drugs to Swasthya Sathi cancer patients. After several rounds of meeting, the committee on Wednesday submitted a strong recommendation to bar doctors from prescribing some high-value chemotherapy and targeted therapy drugs. Many doctors said these drugs were too costly against the likely benefits patients may get. Why thrust such costly drugs on Swasthya Sathi patients, especially when the cost could hugely outweigh the benefits? A guideline barring such drugs will ensure proper utilisation of Swasthya Sathi funds and cost-effective treatment,” said a radiation oncologist attached with a private hospital. The health department, it was learnt, is also working to fix a rational rate for different packages of oncology surgeries under Swasthya Sathi. Currently, there is no dedicated rate-chart for onco-surgeries. Packages for some cancer surgeries are included under heads like “haematology” and “treatment for critical illness” in the absence of a specific cancer-surgery package. The health department officials, along with the experts’ committee, have been holding several rounds of meetings with private hospitals before the package rates are finally drafted. “In addition to the issue of high-value drugs, we are coming up with specific packages for cancer surgeries, major and minor. For this, we have taken private hospitals into confidence for feedback and inputs. It will take a few more rounds before we draft the package rates. We can expect a major reform for cancer treatment under Swasthya Sathi,” said another health department official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/govt-to-bar-costly-cancer-drug-use-in-swasthya-sathi/articleshow/86308109.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Wastage worry as Covaxin stocks lie unused at private hospitals||KOLKATA: Several private hospitals in Kolkata are saddled with a huge stock of Covaxin, which have had few takers compared to Covishield, leaving them worried about a possible wastage of the doses that will pass their expiry dates in a few months. Number of Covaxin recipients have been restricted to a daily count of 10 and 40 at most hospitals, compared to an average of 500-plus Covishield recipients. Some believe that Covaxin may have more takers once it is accepted in countries which still insist on Covishield for entry. AMRI has a stock of 45,000 Covaxin doses. It has been administering merely 50-60 doses out of a total of 600 vaccinations a day. “These can be stored for three more months. It’s an area of concern since we don’t know what to do with these. The demand for Covaxin has been consistently low. We are trying to push it and tell recipients that it’s also an approved vaccine. But since you can’t travel to certain countries with Covaxin, people are somehow reluctant,” said AMRI CEO Rupak Barua. He added that the WHO is likely to approve Covaxin next month. “We expect a spurt in demand and hope that we manage to exhaust our stock,” said Barua. One big advantage of Covaxin is that its second dose can be taken in four weeks. “But so far that hasn’t been an incentive for recipients to go for it,” said Barua. RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) has around 1,500 doses of Covaxin in stock with a daily consumption of just 20 doses. “At this rate, we will find it difficult to exhaust the stock in the short term and may end up with a risk of having some unutilized stock nearing expiry date, thereby ending up as wastage. To avoid this we would be trying to utilize the same in our outreach vaccination programs or even free camps which we organize on weekends to use the available stock,” said RTIICS zonal head R Venkatesh. Medica Superspecialty Hospital holds 760 doses of Covaxin doses while the daily consumption is just 10-15 doses. “For Covishield, the average consumption has been 200-250. But we hope to be able to exhaust the Covaxin stock over the next few months,” said Medica chairperson Alok Roy. Peerless Hospital reduced its Covaxin requisition several months ago and is now left with 160 doses. “Demand has been very low and our average daily administration is just 20-22. At this rate, we are worried about exhausting our stock since these doses will expire in November,” said Peerless CEO Sudipta Mitra. Hospitals are trying to stress on the major advantage that Covaxin offers, especially to those who need to travel abroad – a short gap of just 4 weeks between doses compared to Covishield’s 84 days. “But it hasn’t been working since Covaxin is not yet recognized in most countries. Secondly, there is a belief that Covaxin is less effective than Covishield,” said a hospital chief. According to ICMR, the reason behind reducing the gap between Covaxin doses is the fact that it can provide optimum level of protection only after both doses have been administered. The first Covishield dose, on the other hand, remains effective for 12 weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/wastage-worry-as-covaxin-stocks-lie-unused-at-pvt-hosps/articleshow/86303169.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

---||India||Not afraid of Owaisi, will mark Hyderabad Liberation Day: Amit Shah||HYDERABAD: Union home minister Amit Shah on Friday said BJP, unlike the governing TRS, was not afraid of Asaduddin Owaisi's AIMIM and would commemorate the Hyderabad Liberation Day on September 17 after it gets elected in the state. Addressing a public meeting in Nirmal, he alleged that CM K Chandrasekhar Rao had reneged on his vow to declare September 17 as Telangana Day. "TRS governs with the cooperation of AIMIM and Congress lacks courage to take them on. After coming to office in the next (assembly) polls, we will officially declare September 17 as Hyderabad Liberation Day," he said. The princely state of Hyderabad was officially made part of the Union on September 17, 1948 after Indian forces marched into the Nizam-ruled region. BJP has consistently alleged that TRS does not celebrate this historic event as it would upset AIMIM followers who were initially against merging into India. Shah's visit to Telangana has come just ahead of the crucial Huzurabad assembly byelection and will play a key role in galvanising party cadre. The byelection, expected to be held in the last week of October, was necessitated as former state minister Eatala Rajender resigned as MLA after he was removed from the state cabinet over corruption allegations. Making it clear that BJP opposes reservations based on religion, Shah said the cause of 'Telangana's liberation' (from TRS) will be accomplished only if BJP comes to power and celebrates the day without fear. "Congress is losing its grip across the country and BJP is expanding in the state as well. I'm convinced that we will win all assembly constituencies in the 2024 elections," he said. He urged the party cadre to work hard and win all 17 Lok Sabha seats in Telangana in the next poll.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/not-afraid-of-owaisi-will-mark-hyderabad-liberation-day-amit-shah/articleshow/86310062.cms||Sreebaala Vadlapatla

But the brave girl has showed she’s made of sterner stuff, fighting all odds, including a legal battle and a bone tumour, to complete her MD in pathology and proving where there’s a will there’s a way. In fact, the adversity only strengthened her resolve to work for the coveted degree despite the bureaucracy’s difficult rules. “I am very happy to have passed MD. It has been difficult, but I had promised myself that I won’t give up,” Roshan, 29, told TOI. In October 2008, Roshan and her school friends were returning from Andheri to Jogeshwari by train when she fell onto the tracks and her legs came under the moving train. Her lower limbs were severed at the ankle and thigh. Roshan, who had scored 92.2% in Class X in 2008, was returning home after writing her college exam at Bandra’s Anjuman-i-Islam Girls College. The journey of the vegetable vendor’s daughter to becoming a doctor has not been easy. Want to open a lab for poor, says girl who lost legs in train mishapShe had to approach the Bombay high court for admission to MBBS even after cracking the entrance exam. There was a rule that allowed only people with “up to 70% handicap” to study medicine, but she was found to be 86% handicap post-accident. She had to make several rounds of the court during the legal battle for admission even as financial problems dogged the family. Then Chief Justice of the Bombay HC, Justice Mohit Shah, directed that Roshan be given admission. And she has never looked back since. Roshan passed MBBS with first class in 2016 from Seth GS Medical College (KEM hospital). She cracked the PG medical entrance exams in 2018 and got admission in the same college for MD (pathology). “Before admission in MD, I faced the same problem of 86% disability. The forms were to be applied online and I had only two days. Kirit Somaiya, then an MP, met the Union health minister with my documents and I learnt that the upper limit for disabled for admission was changed. I applied and got admission,” Roshan said. During her second year in MD, Roshan was diagnosed with bone tumour. “I was operated on and during this time our HoD, Dr Amita Joshi, my batchmates, teachers and friends helped me a lot,” she said. In the MD results, declared on Wednesday, she secured 4th rank in the KEM pathology department with 65% marks. She said she has a two-year bond service for MBBS and MD and will complete it first. “After this, if there is vacancy in any government hospital, I will apply. My plan is to start a laboratory and diagnostic centre in a rural area where people at present travel long distances for medical tests. If I get financial help, I will start it or will wait till I am financially equipped to start a laboratory. My centre will have concessional testing and free testing for the poor,” added Roshan. Roshan, third among four siblings, stays in a 10x10 rented chawl in Jogeshwari. Her father, Jawwad Shaikh, has retired and her brother Abu Talib, a salesman, shoulders the family’s responsibilities. During treatment, her brother in-law Tabrez Shaikh, acted as a pillar of the family. Roshan said orthopedic surgeon Dr Sanjay Kantharia, who operated on her, helped her like she was his daughter. Senior lawyer V P Patil had taken up her case for free and MLA Ameen Patel financed her medical education.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-girl-who-lost-legs-in-railway-mishap-completes-md/articleshow/86310104.cms||Mateen Hafeez
---||Jaipur||Compulsory marriage registration Bill passed in Rajasthan assembly amidst Opposition walk-out||JAIPUR: The Rajasthan assembly passed the Compulsory Registration of Marriage (Amendment) Bill 2021 amidst walk out by the Opposition on Friday. The Opposition alleged that the provision of compulsory registration of marriages of even minors was a violation of the original Act and would promote child marriages. Speaking on the Bill, Urban development and housing minister Shanti Dhariwal said it has been brought to comply with the orders of the Supreme Court. He clarified that the registration of a minor's marriage does not mean that it has become legal and it was for the officials to initiate action against violators. Though the Opposition demanded division on the Bill, the House passed it by voice vote resulting in the walk-out. Section 8 of the Act provides that if parties to the marriage have not completed the age of marriage, the parents or guardians shall be held responsible to submit the application within a period of 30 days. It has been decided to incorporate the provision of registration of marriage in case of death of parties/party (husband or wife) also. The Opposition also objected to this provision. But Dhariwal said the marriage certificate was a legal document which is required to avail many governmental benefits, including reservation for widows in government services, pension, etc. While the Section 5 of Rajasthan Compulsory Registration of Marriages Act, 2009, provides for the appointment of district marriage registration officer, the government by the amendment has decided to appoint additional marriage registration officer and block marriage registration officer for monitoring and reviewing the work of registration of marriages at the district and block level which was welcomed by all.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rajasthan-compulsory-registration-of-marriage-bill-passed-amidst-opposition-walk-out/articleshow/86310028.cms||---

The government released an order to this effect on Friday. According to officials, the introduction of English medium education at the undergraduate level will enhance the career prospects of students. Of the 2.62 lakh students, who have taken admissions into degree colleges in 2020-21, only 65,989 students were admitted into Telugu medium. This translates to more than 75% students opting for English medium even before it was made mandatory in all colleges from the 2021-22 academic year. The Andhra Pradesh State Council of Higher Education, which is preparing to roll out English medium from this academic year, is working on bilingual textbooks. The unique feature will be curated lessons published in both Telugu and English in the same non-language textbooks. While one page will contain Telugu medium lessons, the next page will have the lesson in English. These textbooks are expected to help in the smooth transition of students from Telugu to English medium. Training progresss to improve English skillsState officials said special training programmes are being designed to improve English speaking and writing skills of degree students. According to education officials, a 2016 report of Cambridge University titled ‘Findings of English at work: Global analysis of language skills in workplace’ highlighted that about 90% of employers, who look to recruit in India, said English language skills are important for their organisations. Earlier, the government had decided to introduce English medium schools across the state. But the decision was challenged in the AP High Court. Andhra Pradesh is perhaps the first state to offer English as the medium of instruction at all degree colleges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/english-medium-in-all-ap-degree-colleges-from-this-yr/articleshow/86303019.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

This is MP’s highest vax score on any day, but it fell short of its target of 32 lakh doses. When the doses crossed 25 lakh around 10pm, CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan took to twitter to thank health workers, officials and people of the state. “Without your efforts and cooperation, this wouldn’t have been possible. This energy should continue till we vaccinate every eligible person in MP against Corona,” he said. Crucially, 12.4 lakh (47%) of these were second doses, about a fourth of the total lag. Getting millions of people who have missed their second doses to turn up for the jab is proving to be a challenge for the administration, but Friday’s turnout indicates government efforts seem to be working. The maximum vaccination took place between 12 noon and 2 pm, when around 2.59 lakh doses were administered – or nearly 2,160 doses a minute across the state. Ashoknagar topped in terms of percentages, with 38,226 doses against a target of 31,000 (122%), while Balaghat pulled off a stunner, administering 76,264 doses (121%). With 45762 doses, Narsinghpur (114%) was third around midnight. Bhopal notched up 112% of its target. Midnight figures showed it had administered over 1.36 lakh doses on Friday, and Indore, which has already achieved 100% of its first-dose target, administered 1.26 lakh doses. More than 1 lakh doses were administered in seven districts — Bhopal, Indore, Dhar, Satna, Ujjain, Rewa and Chhindwara. Among them, Rewa and Satna districts had been listed among the laggards with less than 60% of the eligible population covered, but they shone on the big day. The MP government has revised its deadline for 100% vaccination to September 26 instead of September-end. In Morena, 89,508 doses were administered, or 111% of target, while Shivpuri achieved 110% with 89,778 doses. Rewa (109,777) in Anuppur (20,727) were at 109%, followed by Agar (108%, 15214 doses), Rajgarh (107%, 65850 doses), Mandsaur (102%, 68876 doses), Chhindwara (102%, 107,487 doses) and Dewas (101%, 69898 doses). Vaccination was carried out across 12,471 government vaccination centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-notches-up-26-4-lakh-covid-vaccine-doses-13-districts-score-over-100/articleshow/86310109.cms||---

---||Indore||Can’t say 15-year-old didn’t know impact of her action, says Madhya Pradesh high court, grants bail to Pocso accused||INDORE: The Indore bench of Madhya Pradesh high court has granted bail to a man accused of raping a minor, observing that she had gone with him on her own and given birth to a child, so it “cannot be said that a 15-year-old didn’t know the impact of her actions”. The bench of Justice Pranay Verma allowed bail to the 22-year-old accused on a personal bond of Rs 1 lakh. He has been in custody since July 30. The girl went missing on November 22, 2018, after which her father filed a complaint of abduction at Mahidpur police station of Ujjain district. Police registered a case against ‘unknown persons’. She was traced to Surat in July 2021 and was found living with a youth from Mandsaur district of MP. By then, she had given birth to a boy from the relationship. Police arrested him and brought back the girl and her one-and-a-half-year-old child. According to police, she said that the youth had taken her to Surat on a false promise and developed physical relations with her, resulting in the birth of the child. Justice Verma observed, “The prosecutrix was aged about 15 years at the time she went with the applicant, but it appears that she had gone voluntarily, of her own will, and continued to live with the applicant and has also given birth to a child. It cannot be said that even though she may be 15 years of age, she was not capable of knowing the full impact of her act.” She is also stated to be living with the bail applicant, he pointed out in the September 9 order, adding: “In the facts of the case, I am thus of the considered view that it is a fit case for grant of bail to the applicant. Accordingly, the application is hereby allowed.” The accused faces charges for abduction, rape and repeated rape under IPC sections 363, 376, 376(2)(n) and 376(3) and sections 3/4(2), 5(1)/6 of Pocso Act. Counsel for the accused, Amit Mittal, submitted that the girl had gone out on her own will with the applicant, lived with him and gave birth to a child. She left her father's protection knowing what she was doing, therefore, it could not be said that the applicant had taken her away from the lawful guardianship of her parents, Mittal submitted, while requesting for bail. Advocate Mittal relied on two judgments of Bombay high court of 2015 to base his argument. Government advocates opposed bail, pointing out that the girl was 15 years old at time of the incident, hence the question of consent should not arise. She had gone with the accused on a false pretext and he had kept her with him for a considerably long time, they said.

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh government opposes GST cover on fuel||VIJAYAWADA: The AP government has opposed the central government’s proposal to include petrol and diesel under the GST (Goods and Services Tax) framework. At the 45th GST Council meeting in Lucknow on Friday, finance minister Buggana Rajendranath said AP has been opposed to the move right from the beginning. Asking the Centre and the GST Council to honour the states’ rights under the federal structure, he said the revenues of the states under GST regime do not match the revenues under VAT. “The states have lost over 5% of revenue because of GST. While earlier the revenue used to witness an average annual growth of 14-15%, under GST it has stayed around 10%. The last two years also saw a fall in tax revenues due to the pandemic,” he said, while urging the Centre to provide additional funds in the form of compensation to support the states. The finance minister further stated that as per existing notifications and the proposals of the fitment committee constituted by the GST Council, the rate of tax applicable to polished napa stone is 18%. Pointing out that for similar low-end stones produced in other states, such as Kota stone of Rajasthan, the tax rate is 5% except those with mirror finish, he called for GST to be reduced on napa slabs on par with Kota stone. — Gopi Dara||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ap-opposes-gst-cover-on-fuel/articleshow/86308828.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka administers 27.8 lakh doses; crosses 5 crore overall||BENGALURU: More than 27.8 lakh doses, the highest in the country, were administered in Karnataka till 9.30pm on Friday, which amounted to 88% of the 31 lakh target the state had set for the special Covid-19 vaccination drive. With data still coming in, officials expected to get even closer to their target. In the process, the state’s overall vaccination coverage crossed the 5-crore dose mark. During the special drive, doses were administered at 12,063 centres across the state, of which 11,648 were government-run centres and the others private facilities. The previous single-day record of doses administered was on September 1, when health professionals inoculated nearly 12.5 lakh people under the state’s ‘special Wednesday vaccination drive’. In terms of most doses, BBMP topped coverage with 4 lakh doses being administered within its limits as at 9.30 pm. Bengaluru city had aimed to administer 5 lakh doses. BBMP authorities said Bengaluru was in top spot in terms of doses for the day among all districts in the country on Friday. After Bengaluru, Belagavi was second, administering nearly 2.4 lakh doses, followed by 1.3 lakh jabs in Dakshina Kannada. Each district was given a target based on the eligible unvaccinated population and the state distributed 34 lakh vaccine doses among all districts. The drive also focused on ramping up second dose coverage. Eleven districts including Bengaluru Urban, Shivamogga, Ramanagara, Dharwad, Hassan, Davanagere, Chikkamagaluru and Haveri, exceeded their targets. Bengaluru Urban, which had a target of 50,000 doses, achieved 132% and topped the state. However, coverage was low in Kalaburagi with the district meeting only 37% of its target. Data from the state health and family welfare department shows, total vaccinations stood at 13 lakh at 2.30pm, but then the drive quickly accelerated. An hour later, the total number of doses administered stood at 15.4 lakh, while the coverage touched 18 lakh at 4.30pm. Over the next hour, by 5.30pm, the daily vaccination coverage had crossed the 20-lakh milestone (65% of the target). At 6.30pm, the numbers had climbed to 23 lakh doses. During the launch of the Lasika drive on Friday and a blood donation camp at Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital in Bengaluru, health and medical education minister K Sudhakar said that it was a meaningful way to mark the birthday of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Inoculating the poor and downtrodden on priority against Covid was the objective of the special drive, he said. As on Thursday (September 16), the state had inoculated 73% of its eligible population overall with at least one dose, while second dose coverage stood at 23%. Friday’s special drive was not only aimed at ramping up coverage by focusing on the 27% unvaccinated population, but also fully inoculating those who were due for their second dose. Dr Arundhathi Chandrashekar, mission director, National Health Mission, Karnataka, told TOI that a lot of micro-planning was done in the districts over the past five days ahead of the special drive. “Sufficient supply of doses, planning and coordination played key roles, besides Covid vaccination related awareness activities,” she said. With that, a total of 87 lakh doses have been administered so far in September alone. “We are confident of crossing the target of 1.5 crore, the target we had set for ourselves in September,” said Sudhakar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-administers-27-8-lakh-doses-crosses-5-crore-overall/articleshow/86310281.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Karnataka government tables bill to ban web gaming for profit||BENGALURU: The Karnataka government on Friday introduced a bill in the legislative assembly to ban online gaming for profit and online gambling and betting to curb the harmful effects of placing bets via the internet and mobile apps. The objective is to add teeth to the Police Act by making these offences cognisable and non-bailable. They will attract a maximum imprisonment of three years and a penalty of up to Rs 1 lakh. Home minister Araga Jnanendra tabled the Karnataka Police (Amendment) Bill, 2021, which aims to “ban online games, involving all forms of wagering or betting, including in the form of tokens valued in terms of money paid before or after issue of it by amending the Karnataka Police Act of 1963”. He said: “The idea of introducing this bill is to wean them (people) away from the vice of gambling.” However, there’s no clarity whether online gambling and betting on cricket matches will come under its purview. This becomes significant as the IPL resumes in the UAE on Sunday. First offence to attract 6-month jail termAsked about it, Jnanendra said there will be clarity after the bill gets the governor’s consent. “At this point in time, I cannot say whether a particular app or company will be banned. Playing online fantasy cricket is not banned but playing online fantasy cricket for profit by placing bets will be banned. It’ll be applicable once the governor gives his assent and this may take a few days,” he told TOI. There is no ban on lottery or betting on horse races at any course within or outside Karnataka. According to the bill, gaming includes the use of cyberspace, including computer resources or any communication device as defined in the Information Technology Act, 2000 in gaming. For the first offence, punishment will be six months imprisonment and fine of Rs 10,000. For the second offence, it’s one year jail and fine of Rs 15,000. For the third offence, it’s 18 months imprisonment and fine of Rs 20,000. Persons aiding or abetting online gaming will also be punished. Instruments of gaming include any article intended to be used as a means of gaming, including computers, computer system, mobile app, or internet or cyberspace, virtual platform, computer network, computer resource, any communication device, electronic applications, software and accessories. They also include means of online gaming, any document, register or record or evidence of any gaming in electronic or digital form, proceeds of any online gaming or any winning or prize in money or otherwise distributed or intended to be distributed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/govt-tables-bill-to-banweb-gaming-for-profit/articleshow/86309294.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: PU boy shoots himself with dad’s pistol; kin clueless about motive||BENGALURU: A II PU student died allegedly by suicide after shooting himself in the head using his father’s licensed pistol near IAF Training Command Headquarters on Sanjaynagar Main Road in the early hours of Friday. The reason for the extreme step is yet to be established. The deceased is Rahul Bhandari, a resident of RT Nagar and class 12 student of Army Public school (Parachute Regiment Training Centre) in JC Nagar. Son of Bhagat Singh Bhandari and Pavana, 17-year-old Rahul was pursuing science (PCMB combination) and was a high-scorer, the family said. Deputy commissioner of police (central) MN Anuchet said: “Rahul’s parents said he had the habit of going for a walk early morning after studying. On Friday too, he stepped out and carried the licensed pistol belonging to his father, who got it after he retired from the army in 2017. Investigation revealed one bullet entered Rahul’s head from the right temple and exited from the other side.” Though no death note was left behind, police said CCTV footage sourced from the neighbourhood showed Rahul walking on the street around 3.40am looking into his mobile phone. The death came to light when a patrolling Hoysala vehicle spotted the body around 5am and alerted jurisdictional police from Sadashivanagar station. Inspector Anil Kumar rushed to the spot and contacted the family using the mobile phone recovered from Rahul’s trouser pocket. The family members had made several calls to Rahul after realising he hadn’t returned. Cops called them on the same numbers and informed them about the tragedy. While police suspected it to be a death by suicide after reconstructing the sequence of events, the shocked family members weren’t ready to accept the same. Pavana reportedly pleaded with the cops: “He wouldn’t commit suicide. Please don’t say he did so.” Bhagat Singh, who wept holding a photo of Rahul stored on his mobile, said: “All that I wanted for him was to get a good education and decent job. He was good at yoga. We never forced him over academics. His friends may provide some clue on the motive as he used to constantly communicate with them.” Police are examining Rahul’s cellphone to get more information. “We suspect he may have chatted with someone minutes before taking the extreme step. We are scanning his mobile records and other related materials,” an investigator said. Police are probing all possible angles. “Before the incident, he sent many messages on WhatsApp and seems to have deleted them later. The parents are clueless about the motive,” the officer added. Sleuths from Forensic Science Laboratory found chocolates, question papers and a maths-related book in the backpack Rahul was carrying.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/pu-boy-shoots-himself-with-dads-pistol-kin-clueless-about-motive/articleshow/86303828.cms||---
---||Pune||Active Covid cases less than 50 in 14 districts in Maharashtra, sign of second wave nearing end||PUNE: The active Covid-19 caseload is currently below 50 in at least 14 districts in Maharashtra and in single digits in seven of them, data from the public health department showed, hinting at the second wave of the pandemic reaching its fag end. State disease surveillance officer Dr Pradeep Awate told TOI that districts like Jalgaon, Nandurbar, Dhule, Nanded, Wardha, Yavatmal, Buldhana and Bhandara, among others, had active cases in single- to double-digit. “Active cases have started dropping significantly in these districts as Maharashtra begins nearing the end of second wave. As the incidence of Covid-19 and daily detections have reduced in these districts, active cases have fallen too. Active cases are currently below 100 in many districts in Maharashtra, while the maximum active cases are concentrated only in eight or nine districts,” he said. Awate said this was an indication of the second wave waning, something that was also visible from the positivity rate in Maharashtra. Active cases less than 50 in 14 dists, sign of second wave nearing endAwate said the testing had reduced in some of these districts because the number of tests conducted were directly proportional to the new case count being detected and their contacts. The reduction in active cases in these districts was, thus, in no way the fallout of fewer tests, he said. “It is because the second wave is losing steam in these regions,” he said. “For instance, if a region has 10 new cases, all the contacts of these cases are traced and tested for Covid. When there is a reduction in new cases, then naturally their contacts also reduce, causing a drop in daily tests. Therefore, there is an automatic dip of 10-20% in testing when new positive cases reduce. Also, there has been a marked drop in influenza-like illnesses or severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) cases in these districts,” he said. “As per WHO, with positivity rate being consistently under 5%, the outbreak can be considered to be under control. In the last three to four weeks, the state’s weekly positivity rate has been 2.5%-2.6%. The second wave may, thus, be nearing its end in Maharashtra,” he said. State’s Covid-19 task force member Dr Shashank Joshi told TOI, “The state is now approaching a period when several districts may become Covid-free, which is a good sign. But they cannot be complacent, and ensure full vaccination of almost 80% of the population.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/active-covid-cases-less-than-50-in-14-districts-in-maharashtra-sign-of-second-wave-nearing-end/articleshow/86310165.cms||Neha Madaan

---||Bengaluru||Attendance improves in Palike schools in Bengaluru||BENGALURU: Despite fears over a third Covid-19 wave, attendance in BBMP schools has significantly improved with nearly 76% of students in grades 8 to 10 and 60% in grades 6 and 7 turning up for on-campus classes. The pandemic has severely impacted the education system with schools being closed for close to two years. Children have not only missed out on academics, but also camaraderie and games with friends and classmates. With fresh Covid cases falling, the government, after much deliberation, allowed schools to reopen in a phased manner. BBMP schools, which largely cater to children from the economically weaker sections, have shown the way as students are keen on attending classes. Data accessed by TOI shows of the 808 students enrolled in classes 6 and 7, 60% have been attending oncampus classes. And of the 6,590 students in grades 8 to 10, a tad under 76% are back in classrooms. “Schools in Byraveshwara Nagar and Herohalli have more than 600 students in classes 8 to 10 on their rolls and more than 55% of students are attending classes,” said Shankar Reddy, director of education (BBMP). “Since most students are from poor families, they have no recourse to online classes, and prefer regular classes.” A principal from a BBMP school said: “We did not expect such a good response, but we are more than happy, and attendance is rising on a daily basis.” The principal said besides learning, children are keen on catching up with friends too. At the BBMP high school in Padarayanapura, once a Covid hotspot, 362 of the total 457 students in grades 8 to 10 have been turning up for lessons in classrooms. “Considering the first outbreak was in Padarayanapura, we wondered if parents would send their children. But those worries were unfounded,” said a senior BBMP officer (education). A similar pattern was noticed in classes 6 and 7 in Marutimandira ward. “Marutimandira ward was a containment zone for the longest of times during the second wave. So, we didn’t expect many students to turn up. But we were wrong,” said a teacher of a BBMP primary school in the ward. BBMP is now persuading parents of these children to get vaccinated. “We have directed headmasters and principals to check the vaccination status of parents. If they have not got it, we will inoculate them to ensure their children do not contract the virus,” Reddy said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/attendance-improves-in-palike-schools-in-bengaluru/articleshow/86310323.cms||Nithya Mandyam
---||Ghaziabad||2020: When street crimes were low in Ghaziabad, but vehicle thefts weren’t||GHAZIABAD: In 2020, when people confined themselves to homes because of the pandemic, vehicle-lifters were out on the prowl in Ghaziabad. The lockdown year saw street crimes go down considerably, but vehicle thefts still remained high. According to a report by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), there were 1,248 vehicle thefts in 2020. Though the figure is lower than the previous year — when 2,675 vehicles were stolen — it stands out when compared with other crimes like snatchings, thefts and robberies in 2020. Quite a few of the cases were reported during the lockdown months. Between January and June this year, a total of 977 vehicles, including two-wheelers, have been stolen in Ghaziabad, according to another survey. A majority of the thefts was reported from Kavi Nagar, where several burglaries have taken place, Indirapuram and Sahibabad. “One of the reasons why Ghaziabad is a hotbed of vehicle thefts is that residents tend to park their cars in the open, making them more vulnerable,” said a police officer. “In societies in Indirapuram, many cars can be seen along the roads because of lack of parking space,” he added. A survey conducted by the Ghaziabad Development Authority had found that illegal parking along Kala Patthar Road eats away 450 car spaces at any given time. On CISF Road, haphazard parking eats away the space of 128 cars. Another reason for vehicle thefts is Ghaziabad’s proximity to Meerut and other western UP districts that are considered hubs for sale and purchase of stolen vehicles’ parts. “In Meerut’s Soti Ganj, stolen vehicles are dismantled within a matter of hours and the spare parts sold,” an officer said. “It takes less than 45 minutes for vehicle-lifters to cross over to Meerut from Ghaziabad. The reaction time of police to track stolen vehicles depends on how quickly the theft is reported. More often than not, the time gap proves to be a deterrent in tracing the vehicles,” he added. So, what is the police doing to stop the theft of vehicles? Suraj Rai, ASP (Meerut), claimed that in the past two months, not a single stolen vehicle had been dismantled in Sotiganj. “We conduct searches on a regular basis. In July, we had conducted a massive crackdown, in which we had sealed over 10 godowns. Now, most of the notorious people have left the place,” he added. The cops in Ghaziabad are banking on Integrated Traffic Management System to check vehicle thefts. But the project has been delayed several years. “Police teams are also working with the RWAs. They have been asking the RWAs to keep only one or two gates open at night. Entry and exit should be monitored by the guards. We are listing spots where there are more thefts. Patrolling will be done accordingly,” said Pawan Kumar, the Ghaziabad SSP..||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/2020-when-street-crimes-were-low-but-vehicle-thefts-werent/articleshow/86306516.cms||Abhijay Jha

He could not locate his car that he parked near his society gate. It took Anupam some time to realise that his vehicle was stolen. But what followed was arguably worse, an unending ordeal that lasted months. His car could still not be tracked. “I went numb when I found out that my Alto was stolen. After a while, I dialled 100 and later rushed to the police station to lodge a complaint,” said Anupam. “I could sense that there was a deliberate attempt on part of the police to not lodge an FIR in the case. Instead, I was advised to wait till the next day while they looked for my car. The next day, I got the same response when I reached the police station. I persevered and kept on visiting them for a week, after which an FIR was lodged,” added Anupam. He claimed that the cops advised him to claim the insurance amount instead of pestering them. He said, “The car had sentimental value. I insisted on locating the car but that never happened. Finally, I was given a non-traceable report, which I used to claim the insurance amount.” Kavi Nagar resident Naresh Sikdar’s bike was stolen from a busy market near Ghanta Ghar last year. “In January 2020, I had gone to a departmental store and parked my bike by the road when it was stolen,” said Naresh Sikdar. “The theft was recorded on CCTV cameras. Two men with their faces covered arrived and it took them less than four minutes to break open the bike’s lock,” added Sikdar. He met with a similar fate at the police station. Advocate Rajeev Ranjan Raj, a Ghaziabad resident, explained the police’s reluctance in lodging FIR immediately. “Recovery of stolen vehicles in most cases happens by chance. The police force is otherwise not equipped technologically or in terms of manpower,” he said. “The police delay FIRs primarily because they want to avoid paperwork. In case they trace a vehicle in 24 hours, it is handed over to the owner without any paperwork. That also saves them from the subsequent court visits, which may last up to several years,” added Raj. He said that since vehicles are insured even the complainant after some time claims that amount and forgets his vehicle while there is a tendency on the part of police not to invest time and energy on recovering stolen vehicles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/car-gone-in-minutes-an-endless-wait-for-fir/articleshow/86306540.cms||Abhijay Jha
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: ATM card sent to separated wife, bank to refund Rs 1.6L withdrawn||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission has ordered Axis Bank to pay Rs 1.66 lakh with 7% interest to Vinodbhai Joshi after his ATM card was mistakenly dispatched to Joshi’s judicially separated wife and the amount was withdrawn from his bank account with the card. According to case details, Joshi, a resident of Nardipur near Kalol town, had a joint account with his son in Axis Bank. A debit card was being used by the father-son duo. After he lost the card, Joshi requested the bank in September 2009 to send a new card, which he never received. A year later on August 26, 2010, when Joshi went to the bank to withdraw Rs 10,000 through a self cheque, he was informed of insufficient balance. After examining the bank statement, Joshi came to the conclusion that the ATM card that he had ordered had been sent to his separated wife’s address in Gandhinagar by the bank authorities. Later, a total of Rs 1,66,900 was withdrawn from the account. Joshi sued the bank at the Gandhinagar District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum in 2010. Service found to be deficientVinodbhai Joshi sought refund of the lost money, alleging deficiency in service on part of the bank. He contended that he had informed the bank about the family suit filed for judicial separation between him and his wife in 2005. He had also furnished his address, but the bank sent it to his wife’s address and she allegedly withdrew the money. In reply, the bank authorities claimed that the debit card was sent to Joshi only and the withdrawal of the amount was made by Joshi and his son only, which was proved by CCTV footage also. However, the bank never furnished the evidence before the consumer court. On the other hand, evidence revealed that the debit card was sent to Joshi’s wife at Gandhinagar and not to Joshi at Nardipur. The bank’s claim that PIN was mailed to Joshi also could not be proved. The documents reflected that the PIN was not received by Joshi, but it was sent to his wife’s address through courier service and their son received it on October 1, 2009. After hearing the case, the forum in 2011 held the bank responsible for the blunder and ordered it to pay the amount to Joshi. The bank questioned the decision before the state commission, where its judicial member M J Mehta upheld the forum’s conclusion and held the bank responsible for deficiency in service. The commission has ordered it to make payment with interest since 2010 to the consumer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-atm-card-sent-to-separated-wife-bank-to-refund-rs-1-6l-withdrawn/articleshow/86310380.cms||Saeed Khan

Phase 1 of the three-phase project, which aims at revamping the existing electricity infrastructure in old Gurgaon, is only 60% complete. The entire project initially had a deadline of June 2019. Now, it will take two more years to be completed if work goes smoothly, discom officials said. DHBVN has cited resistance from locals, lack of funds, ban on construction and labour shortage as reasons for the delay. Out of 580 feeders which were to be laid underground in the first phase, only 195 are operational. These feeders cover sectors 17, 21, 22, 23, 27, 28, 30, 31, 32, 39, 40, 42 and 43, Palm Vihar, DLF-1 and some blocks of Sushant Lok. Out of 2,000km of underground power cables, only 1,200km has been laid. Work is expected to be complete by 2022-end, which will pave the way for phase 2 of the project. For the second phase, land has been finalised in Sector 52 for building supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) infrastructure, which will act as a one-stop solution as manual work of the discom can be monitored remotely. Under the third phase, nearly 1.3 lakh smart meters have been installed across Gurgaon, of which 1.14 lakh have automatic reading and bill generation features. Discom officials cited several reasons for delay in the completion of the project. The first and foremost reason, they said, is opposition from residents. “We have faced many instances where people have objected to the laying of underground cables. We often get calls from councillors to not dig the land and many other similar issues,” DHBVN superintending engineer Jaideep Phogat told TOI. Phogat also said funding for the project has been reduced. Failure in planning and execution of work by the private companies executing the project, the rainy season and bans on digging issued by MCG also contributed to the delay. Moreover, labour deployment has been affected substantially due to the pandemic, Phogat said. “For instance, there were 400 technical and skilled labourers working from L&T (one of the private firms) earlier, of which only 250 have come back. Companies are struggling to catch up with work,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/smart-grid-project-sees-only-40-progress-in-5-years/articleshow/86306680.cms||Sagrika Kissu
---||Ghaziabad||Delhi-Ghaziabad borders choked for 5 hours||Ghaziabad: Traffic barely moved at two Delhi-Ghaziabad borders near EDM Mall and Anand Vihar through Friday afternoon, drawing angry reactions on social media from stranded commuters. UP Police officers in Ghaziabad said they were caught unawares by Delhi Police’s “sudden decision” to seal the borders and took time to divert traffic and ease the snarls somewhat. Delhi Police, however, denied sealing the borders. “Farmers-related law and order arrangements have been continuing since January 26. Nothing new was done on Friday,” said Priyanka Kashyap, DCP (east). Source said the border curbs were effected in view of a sudden blockade by farmers of the Delhi-Gurgaon border on Thursday night. UP Gate, which is a few kilometres from the EDM and Anand Vihar borders, has been the protest site for farmers backed by the Rakesh Tikait-led Bharatiya Kisan Union for the past 10 months. Police sources said the jams were caused by barricades that were put up and lasted five hours, beginning Friday noon. As commuters took to social media to vent out their anger at the lack of traffic management, senior UP Police officers rushed to the choke points. Around 200 cops from the traffic department and the local police stations were deployed on the roads to divert vehicles. But by the time the traffic cops could react, there were already long tailbacks. Led by Gyanendra Singh, SP (city 2), and Ramanand Kushwaha, SP (traffic), the police diverted vehicles headed for Anand Vihar towards GT Road and Bhopura. Those on the way to Delhi via EDM Mall were diverted towards Seemapuri, Tulsi Niketan, Loni and Noida Sector 62. Singh told TOI they had no prior information about Delhi Police’s decision. “We had to deploy traffic cops and teams from local police stations on the roads to manage the situation,” he added. Shashank Tripathi, a resident of Gaur City, was headed to Anand Vihar railway station to drop his sister when he got stuck in the snarl. “We left home around 2pm, with two hours for the train to depart. Fortunately, we managed to reach the railway station with just 15 minutes in hand,” he said. Kunal, a chartered accountant from Delhi, had come to meet his client in Ghaziabad. He was caught in the jam for two and a half hours. “There was another meeting in Delhi. But I had to cancel that,” he added. The border jams began easing from around 5pm but it took some more time for traffic to normalise.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/delhi-ghaziabad-borders-choked-for-5-hours/articleshow/86306591.cms||---

Police said the woman had eloped with a youth and her family had staged a kidnapping drama to hide that from their neighbours. The police also said the family had misled them and lodged a “fake” complaint in the case. On Thursday, the woman’s family alleged that three men had tried to kidnap the student’s 18-year-old sister and drag her into a car. When the 21-year-old woman tried to intervene, the men abducted her instead, they said. The BSc student was out with her sister and two brothers, all in their teens, for a morning walk when the alleged incident took place near Maripat railway station. But according to the police, the woman had left the house to go to Gonda on Wednesday itself. DCP (central Noida) Harish Chander said her phone had been switched off around 6.30 pm on Wednesday. “It has been found that the woman left her house for Gonda a day before the complaint was filed. She was in touch with a youth from Gonda district for about two years,” he said. Chander said the woman and the youth became friends on Facebook two years ago. Soon, they started chatting with each other and exchanged phone numbers. Villagers in Greater Noida have also said that the family had misled them into believing that the woman had been abducted. Virendra Khari who had called up the police on Thursday to report the incident said: “Five-six of us were out on a morning walk when the children (the woman’s siblings) came to us crying and told us about the abduction. The family has misled us.” While initially, everyone thought the woman had been abducted, CCTV footage raised suspicions. Khari said in the footage that showed where the incident had happened, they saw the woman’s three siblings walking, but she could not be seen. “When we checked the CCTV footage from the area, we found that only three children could be seen. The 21-year-old woman did not appear in any footage. When I asked about her, her sister and two brothers said she was unwell that day and had been walking behind them,” Khari said. Badalpur police has lodged an FIR against the woman’s family and about 100 villagers for blocking NH91 to protest against the “abduction” and demand police action. The FIR has been lodged against the woman’s grandfather, father and an uncle who works with Delhi police. Several other family members have also been named. ACP 2 (central Noida) Yogendra Singh said: “It has been filed on the basis of the CCTV footage that is available with us.” Asked why the villagers were booked when they themselves said the family had misled them, he said there was no reason for anyone to block the road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/abducted-woman-eloped-kin-staged-drama-say-cops/articleshow/86306615.cms||Shikha Salaria
---||Lucknow||Come November, Lucknow to be back as a Test match centre||NEW DELHI: Lucknow will be hosting its first Test match in nearly 28 years when the New Zealand team comes to India after the T20 World Cup in UAE in November. This will be the new Atal Bihari Vajpayee Stadium’s first Test match after the Uttar Pradesh Cricket Association (UPCA) opened it for First-Class cricket in 2016. The match against Sri Lanka at KD Singh Babu Stadium in January 1994 was the last Test featuring India in the city. TOI has learnt that the Indian cricket board (BCCI) has finalized the venues for the two Test matches against New Zealand. The other Test match will be played at the Chinnaswamy stadium in Bengaluru. TOI understands that the board feels that Lucknow is going to be a major cricketing centre. With two new IPL teams set to come in next year, Lucknow is believed to be one of the host cities besides Ahmedabad. “The stadium has good facilities and a capacity of nearly 70000,” a senior BCCI official told TOI. ‘Lucknow was shortlisted for T20 WC if India played host this year’“That’s a good deal for any IPL franchise. Like Ahmedabad, it’s important to give Lucknow exposure to marquee international matches before the IPL teams are finalized. Lucknow was also shortlisted as a venue for the T20 World Cup if it happened in India this year,” a senior BCCI official further told TOI. The Test series will be preceded by the three-T20I series which is likely to begin in the last week of November. The T20 specialists will travel in a bubble from UAE after the T20 World Cup. It will also offer a chance for the senior players, who have been on the road for most of the year, to skip the series and get some rest. The turnaround time from the home series against New Zealand and the first Test in Johennesburg in the third week of December will be around 10 days. The board has kept in mind the need for bubble-to-bubble transfer. Sri Lanka coming for two Tests, three T20Is in Feb-March TOI has also learnt that the Sri Lankan team will come to India for a two-Test series and three T20Is in Feb-March after the Indian team comes back from the full tour of South Africa in late January. The two Tests will be a part of the World Test Championship. As of Mumbai has been zeroed in to host one of the Test matches. The board will soon finalise the entire domestic season.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/come-november-lucknow-to-be-back-as-a-test-match-centre/articleshow/86310353.cms||Arani Basu
---||Noida||Noida goes from 0 to 13 dengue cases in just 3 days, lens on scrub typhus too||NOIDA: Though Gautam Budh Nagar recorded its first two dengue cases just three days ago, the district has added 11 more cases in just two days. The health department is now also monitoring any suspected scrub typhus and leptospirosis cases. ICMR reports had earlier confirmed that the ‘mystery fever’ cases that led to over 100 deaths in Mathura, Firozabad and Mainpuri were cases of dengue, scrub typhus and leptospirosis. Officials said that while all preventive steps are being taken, fogging drives have also been increased in the district. “We held a meeting with all departments and apart from the authorities, the nagar panchayat and other departments have also been told to ensure hygiene and regular sanitation. Anti-larvae spraying and clearing of shrubs around inhabited areas are also being done,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate. Officials said that compared to other districts in the state, the dengue cases have remained low in GB Nagar so far because of better sanitation and less waterlogging issues. “There are hardly any areas in Noida where waterlogging is a major problem. So, rainwater keeps draining out. Regular fogging drives are also going on. All teams that were involved for sanitisation during Covid have now been diverted to fogging,” said Rajesh Sharma, district malaria officer. He added that even during the fever surveillance it has been seen that the general hygiene in the district has increased following the Covid surge. This may be one of the reasons for fewer cases in the district. Meanwhile, the three scrub typhus patients of the district have all been treated and discharged. No new suspected cases were found during the surveillance as well. Malaria cases till the end of August were 23 and fresh cases will be added by the end of September. With rainfall predicted for the rest of the week, officials say that people need to be very careful so that clean water does not collect near homes in places such as pots, coolers, bird feeding trays in balconies, discarded tyres or thermocol cups.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/noida-goes-from-0-to-13-dengue-cases-in-just-3-days-lens-on-scrub-typhus-too/articleshow/86306642.cms||Snehil Sinha
---||Gurgaon||Pilot survey in Gurgaon to assess causes of visual impairment||Gurgaon: The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi, will carry out a five-day survey in the city in association with the Gurgaon health department to understand the causes of visual impairment and blindness. The rapid assessment of avoidable visual impairment (RAAVI) survey, in which nearly 6,000 people will be covered, will start on Tuesday. A total of 30 clusters have been identified for the exercise. “This is a pilot survey and will be conducted in other districts of the country if it yields positive results here,” deputy civil surgeon Isha Narang said. Six teams, each comprising three members, will visit households, ask residents to fill in questionnaires and conduct eye check-ups. They will upload the data onto a mobile application, the RAAVI app, which has been developed by AIIMS for the survey. The exercise will ascertain the visual outcomes after cataract surgery among operated cases and assess coverage for refractive error cases and glaucoma, childhood blindness, retinal detachment and diabetic retinopathy. “Teams will carry out a door-to-door survey in the district. In case people have undergone cataract surgery in the past, its effectiveness will be assessed by the team,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurgaon. Officials said the survey aims to determine the prevalence and causes of eye defects and cataracts, which contribute to the maximum number of cases of blindness in the country. “The six teams will cover 1,200 people in a day,” said Praveen Vashist, in-charge of community ophthalmology, AIIMS, New Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/pilot-survey-in-gurgaon-to-assess-causes-of-visual-impairment/articleshow/86306693.cms||Ipsita Pati
---||Ghaziabad||Six zones in Ghaziabad to boost fight against vector-borne diseases||Ghaziabad: The health department has divided the district into six zones for better surveillance of people affected by vector-borne diseases and deputed senior officials for each area. The officials will conduct inspections and coordinate with the health department as well as local civic bodies for anti-larvae drives. A team of epidemiologists and laboratory staff has also been formed for analysing recent dengue cases. For Saturday, a fogging drive has been planned in areas where a lot of people have been affected by vector-borne diseases. On Friday, 12 new dengue cases were reported in the district, taking Ghaziabad’s 2021 tally to 150. So far this year, 34 scrub typhus and 13 malaria cases have also been reported. Chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Bhavtosh Shankhdhar said: “The district has been divided into six zones — Loni, Bhojpur, Modinagar, Razapur, Urban and Trans-Hindon areas — and the responsibility of each zone will be with either an additional CMO or a deputy CMO.” “Their job is to keep tabs on cases in their respective areas and ensure that malaria and other health teams are visiting patients and critical localities regularly. The responsibility of the zone in-charge has been fixed,” he added. The CMO added that the health department plans to start a concerted anti-larvae drive from Saturday. “Mega drives will be organised in areas that have reported several dengue cases recently. On the first day, the drives would be planned for Govindpuram and Kavi Nagar. All teams of the malaria wing will cover these places. During the campaign, about 100 houses near each dengue patient’s house would be checked for waterlogging and mosquito breeding,” he said. So far this month, 16 dengue cases have been reported in Govindpuram alone and at least 1,600 houses in the area will be screened, officials said. District surveillance officer Dr RK Gupta said: “Dengue patients are being monitored from a control room set up at the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) laboratory. Mapping of areas from where cases are being reported is being done. A team of three doctors has been formed and they will train and instruct the teams going to the field.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/six-zones-in-ghaziabad-to-boost-fight-against-vector-borne-diseases/articleshow/86306674.cms||Aditya Dev
---||Gurgaon||'Most cases of blindness in India due to cataract and refractive errors'||Gurugram: The survey to assess the prevalence of cases of blindness and its causes in the city, which will be conducted next week by AIIMS and the health department, is one of its kind as refractive errors in vision will be covered for the first time in the country, officials from the institute said. According to professor Praveen Vashist, the in-charge of community ophthalmology at AIIMS, they decided to carry out a pilot study to assess the cause of eye defects since 80% cases of blindness in India are caused due to cataracts and refractive errors. In its 73rd health assembly held recently, the World Health Organisation (WHO) came out with global indicators for achieving universal eye healthcare. It included cataract surgical coverage and refractive errors as two of the indicators. While a cataract develops when the lens of the eye becomes cloudy, requiring a surgery to replace it with an artificial lens, refractive errors happen when the shape of the eye keeps a person from focusing properly, resulting in blurry vision. According to WHO’s 2010 data, India accounts for 20% of the global blindness burden. It is not clear where India stands when it comes to refractive errors in vision. The survey has been designed in order to get the correct picture, said Vashist, the principal investigator for the study.  “The study aims to gather data which will be analysed to understand eye defects. This will help in determining a solution for the long run,” he added. Asked how this survey is different from other such surveys, Vashist said: “I was in charge of the national blindness and vision impairment survey conducted between 2015 and 2019. There were some lacunae in the exercise, such as only people above 50 years were included and refractive errors weren’t covered. For the first time, this survey will cover refractive errors and also include population of a district above five years of age. In this survey, we are trying to include all sections of the population. How many people are able to get spectacles for refractive errors will also be covered.” The survey will focus on determining the blindness burden, causes, and associated factors of visual impairment. The impact of visual impairment due to uncorrected refractive errors in younger age groups is enormous, Vashist said. Teams will collect data on how many people have access to spectacles and also study cases of presbyopia (gradual loss of the eyes’ ability to focus on nearby objects). If successful, it can become a pioneer for all such surveys in the future, he said. “We can train people on how to carry out surveys regarding cataract surgery and refractive error issues and conduct similar surveys across India,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/most-cases-of-blindness-due-to-cataract-and-refractive-errors-says-expert/articleshow/86306742.cms||Ipsita Pati
---||Chandigarh||Haryana’s stance on panchayat elections raises hope for Ellenabad bypoll||Chandigarh: The Haryana government’s stand that the situation is normal in the state to hold the panchayat elections has raised the hope for the much awaited bypoll of the Ellenabad assembly constituency in Sirsa district. In a formal statement, before the Punjab and Haryana high court regarding panchayat polls, the Haryana government on Tuesday claimed, “Since now the situation being normalised and further faced with the constitutional mandate of conducting elections within six months from the date of dissolution of panchayats as provided for in article 243E of the constitution and section 3 of Haryana Panchayati Raj Act 1994, the state government in consultation with the state Election Commission intends to commence the process of general elections.” If the state government has no hesitation in holding elections in all the villages, of which there are 6,800 in Haryana, there appears to be no hindrance in the Ellenabad assembly byelection, which has only 71 villages. Another stance taken by the Haryana government in its readiness to hold the panchayat elections in the state was constitutional provisions (article 243E) and the relevant statute that provides holding of polls before the expiry of the term or within six months from the dissolution of the panchayats. This stand of the state would also favour f immediate holding of Ellenabad bypoll because as per section 151-A of the Representation of Peoples Act 1951, a byelection for filling any vacancy shall be held within a period of six months of the vacancy coming up. Ellenabad seat became vacant in assembly on January 27 after INLD’s Abhay Singh Chautala resigned from the seat. For over eight months now, there has been a demand from the opposition parties to hold the election at the earliest. Even while disposing of a petition seeking immediate holding of the byelection in Ellenabad, the Punjab and Haryana high court had recently expressed hope that the Election Commission of India (ECI) would call for voting as soon as the pandemic situation improved. The state’s admission before the HC on Tuesday shows the administration considers the situation conducive for panchayat polls. ECI had delayed the Ellenabad byelection on the concurrence of the ministry of law and justice and certified that due to outbreak of the second wave of Covid-19 in the country, it would not be appropriate to hold byelections till the pandemic situation significantly improved. An examination of Covid-19 data from Sirsa revealed that the district has not witnessed any significant surge in Covid-19 cases in the recent past.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/haryanas-stance-on-panchayat-elections-raises-hope-for-ellenabad-bypoll/articleshow/86306754.cms||Ajay Sura
---||Chandigarh||PM Narendra Modi’s birthday prompts protests by opposition & farmers, prayers by BJP||CHANDIGARH/HISAR/BATHINDA: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s birthday elicited greetings from BJP functionaries and supporters on Friday, but the PM and his government also came under sharp criticism from farm unions and opposition political parties on the occasion. BJP Haryana president Om Prakash Dhankhar went to the extent of performing a yagya (prayer) in the courtyard of Mansa Devi temple in Manimajra to mark Modi’s 71st birthday. In Hisar district of the state, while the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) organised a Covid-19 vaccination camp in Hansi to celebrate Modi’s birthday, the Youth Congress fried pakoras outside the mini-secretariat to highlight joblessness under BJP rule in the country. In neighbouring Punjab’s Mansa district, farmers staged a protest and tried to barge into the district’s India Post headquarters on coming to know that BJP functionaries and workers from Mansa were sending congratulatory letters to Modi. When the police stopped them, the farmers held a protest outside. At Mansa Devi, Dhankar talked about Modi’s connection with the state, recollecting that in 1996, Modi came to Haryana as BJP’s in-charge and spent a long time in the state. "The party’s brigade trained by Modi is leading the organisation and the government," he said. In Mansa, tempers rose during the day. Farmers alleged that they were fighting a harsh battle and had lost over 600 farmers in the ongoing protests, so BJP had no right to celebrate the birthday of the PM, who was responsible for the miseries of farmers. BJP activists, instead of holding an assembly to celebrate the birthday, had decided to post letters to the PM and had reached the post office with Mansa mandal president Rohit Kumar. However, farmers reached the venue when they came to know about it. BKU (Ekta Dakaunda) block secretary Makhan Singh Bhainibagha said when they learnt that BJP leaders were sending letters, they reached the spot too. "We will even protest at the houses of leaders who played a role in sending congratulatory letters to Modi," he said. The activists of farmer organisation Punjab Kisan Union too participated in the protest. Meanwhile, Dhankhar also announced the launch of a campaign, named ‘Sewa Aur Samarpan’ (service and dedication), to mark Modi’s birthday. He said the campaign will come to an end on October 7, when 20 years of Modi’s rule as a CM and PM will be completed. In Hisar, deputy speaker Ranbir Gangwa, MLA Kamal Gupta and BJP district president Captain Bhupendra participated in separate events of blood donation camp and plantation. At the mini-secretariat, local councillor Krishna Satrod described the PM’s birthday as "national unemployed day". Youth Congress also took out a protest procession outside the Hisar mini-secretariat. Satrod said once Modi had said that setting up a pakoda stall also generated a job. "But, today, when we gathered with all necessary items for frying pakodas, we realised that it’s not cheap. For this also, a lot of money will have to be spent, which hardly any unemployed youth will have," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/modis-birthday-elicits-protests-by-oppn-parties-farmers-celebrations-by-bjp/articleshow/86306892.cms||---

A havildar in the Indian Army, Joshi left no stone unturned even while in the hospital — practising in the ward for an hour with walking drills, and doing pushups and yoga. His determination was evident in his first race after Covid in February, when he won bronze at the 50km race walking in the 8th Open National & 4th International Race Walking Championship in Ranchi. On Friday, at the 60th National Open Athletics Championships 2021 at the J N Stadium in Warangal, Telangana, the race walker from Isanpur in Ahmedabad did better, winning silver in the 35km race walk with a time of 2:53:43. Ram Baboo from UP won gold with a time of 2:46:31, while bronze was claimed by Surinder Singh of Punjab in 2:54:22. Speaking to TOI after winning the medal, Joshi said, “My aim was to win gold, but I had participated in an interservices competition in a 50km race walk in Bhubaneswar fifteen days ago. The conditions there were very harsh. Humidity was around 98% and the temperature was 34°C. I still managed to participate here and win a silver medal. I am happy with my performance.” The 34-year-old said if his body was in better shape, he would have given Baboo stiffer competition. “I began the race nicely. Towards the middle, it was up and down and I was second and he was first. I slowed down and fell back in the last 5km. Otherwise, my timing would have been sub 2:50,” he said. He rues missing qualification for the Tokyo Olympics. “I missed the Tokyo Olympics because I was 33 points behind the automatic qualification criteria. After that, I could not participate in international events because India was hit by the severe second wave of Covid-19 resulting in a travel ban on Indians.” With the 50km race walk excluded from the 2024 Paris Olympics, Joshi’s focus is the 35km event. “Next year, we have the World Race Walking Championship in Russia and I want to qualify and win a medal for the country. My bigger aim is to qualify for the Paris Olympics.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/armyman-strides-back-from-covid-with-silver-at-nationals/articleshow/86310433.cms||Sabu Cherian

The nine-day festival, scheduled from October 7 to 15, would be observed in ‘ekantham’ and restricted to temple premises for the second consecutive year. Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) trust board chairman YV Subba Reddy said it has been decided to restrict the celebrations in view of the fears over the perceived third wave of Covid-19. “With reports of a possible third wave likely to impact the country in the coming months, TTD wants to remain cautious and adhere to stringent guidelines to prevent the outbreak of the pandemic in Tirumala. The health and safety of the visiting devotees and TTD staffers remain our top priority. The temple body has therefore, decided to conduct the nine-day annual festival in ‘ekantham’ without the participation of devotees this year too,” he told reporters on Friday. Devotees can watch the live proceedings of Brahmotsavams from the Tirumala temple on Sri Venkateswara Bhakti channel, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/brahmotsavams-in-ekantham-this-year-too/articleshow/86302953.cms||---

Upholding the conviction of a man accused of raping the minor daughter of his friend, a division bench of Justice K Vinod Chandran and Justice Ziyad Rahman AA said, “It is a shame that every other case we consider is sadly a rape of a minor. A minor child was pounced upon… when she was alone in her house and forcefully molested, which is the case of the prosecution.” The bench hears appeals in cases related to offences against women and children. An appeal by Mani Balan, who was convicted by the Pocso special court at Kalpetta in Wayanad, was considered by the court. Even though the accused challenged the conviction by alleging improbability of the story and highlighting minor inconsistencies in the versions presented by the girl and her mother, the court did not agree. As per the prosecution case, the girl was alone at her house between 4pm and 5pm on May 4, 2014 as her mother had gone to attend a Kudumbashree meeting. When the mother returned, she found the daughter crying and she revealed the rape when questioned by her. The girl’s father was not at home. HC rejects ‘fake’ lawyer’s pleaThe high court on Friday declined to grant anticipatory bail to Sessy Xavier, who is alleged to have practised as an advocate for two years without completing her law studies. Justice Shircy V said there is a strong case against the applicant and that the investigating agency is expected to go deep into the offences committed by her in addition to the offences she is already booked for. To do so, custodial interrogation is inevitable, the court held. The court also said chances of her absconding if granted bail cannot be ruled out. Though her counsel submitted that she is a young lady and is immature, the court said those are not justifiable reasons and that law applies to everyone equally.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kerala-high-court-laments-surge-in-pocso-cases/articleshow/86310375.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Punjab: In setback for Amarinder Singh, Congress calls urgent CLP meeting today||CHANDIGARH: In a setback to Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, the All-India Congress Committee (AICC) late on Friday night intervened to convene an immediate meeting of the state’s Congress Legislative Party (CLP) late on Saturday afternoon. AICC in-charge of Punjab affairs Harish Rawat tweeted late on Friday night: “A meeting of the CLP has been convened at 5 pm on 18th September at Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee office. The AICC directs the PPCC to facilitate this meeting. All Congress MLAs of Punjab are requested to kindly attend this meeting.” Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee office. AICC directs the PPCC to facilitate this meeting. All congress MLAs of… https://t.co/1quwjyjTfY— Harish Rawat (@harishrawatcmuk) 1631902162000The AICC decision was taken after a section of Congress MLAs, including some ministers, most of whom are detractors of the chief minister Amarinder Singh, had been continuously pressing for a change in the guard at the helm of Punjab’s administrative affairs. The crisis in Punjab Congress, brewing for months now, had worsened last month after nearly two dozen party MLAs, including four cabinet ministers, declared an open revolt against Amarinder and said that they had no faith that he would be able to fulfill the poll promises. They also accused the chief minister of conspiring with Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal. There is no clarity about what triggered the AICC to intervene and give directions to hold the CLP meeting on Saturday after keeping ‘dissidents’ at bay. The MLAs demanding a CLP meeting have been taking the plea that they wish to discuss the party’s strategy for the 2022 assembly elections. They have been approaching the party high command with the demand. At the same time, the CM’s camp has not been keen on giving the MLAs such a platform. Congmen in state apprehend fresh round of slugfestMany MLAs have been hoping to raise issues, which could embarrass the Congress government – at the assembly session but it was decided to convene only a one-day special session. There is still no word on holding a longer session despite demand from within the Congress. Soon after Rawat’s tweet, Sidhu too tweeted, “As per the AICC directive, Congress Legislative Party meeting has been convened at PPCC office in Chandigarh.” A section of Punjab Congress leaders who had begun to focus on their constituencies over the past few weeks believe that there could be a fresh round of slugfest between various groups in the state unit. The disgruntled cabinet ministers, most of whom have been skipping cabinet meetings, had faced a setback when Rawat last month had made it clear that the 2022 state assembly polls would be contested under Amarinder’s command. However, he had immediately changed his stance when challenged by Punjab MLA Pargat Singh. At the same time, Amarinder too has been trying to garner the support of party MPs and MLAs with a series of meetings. Since Rawat’s last visit to Chandigarh in early September, Sidhu has refrained from open criticism of the chief minister and the state government. Rawat tagged both Sidhu and Amarinder in his tweet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/all-india-congress-committee-orders-punjab-congress-to-call-immediate-congress-legislative-party-meet-today/articleshow/86310420.cms||---

In a video message to the PM, Sikh Dodi Singh from Afghanistan said, “I wish a very happy birthday to Narendra Modi Ji on his birthday on behalf of the sangat (community) here.” Another man said, “Congratulations to Narendra Modi ji on his birthday. We are stranded here in Afghanistan with the entire sangat and facing hardships. We have no money for food or home here. Our children are hungry there (in India), as we are here. Nobody is listening to us and we should be evacuated at the earliest to Hindustan (India) from Kabul.” “We have nothing here. Our children are in Punjab and we are very distressed. We should be evacuated at the earliest,” said a Sikh from Kabul. “Our business was very good here but now we have lost everything... we need immediate evacuation,” added another Sikh. “The concerns of the stranded Indians and Afghan minorities in Kabul are noted but unfortunately, as I am informed, there are various functional issues with the departure and arrival of foreign carriers there. I request the government of India airlift them at the earliest,” said Indian World Forum president Puneet Singh Chandhok.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/stranded-indians-af-hindus-sikhs-appeal-to-modi-for-early-evacuation/articleshow/86307046.cms||---
---||Chennai||AIADMK moves Madras high court opposing two-phase civic body elections||CHENNAI: AIADMK has moved the Madras high court seeking direction to the Tamil Nadu State Election Commission to ensure free and fair  for local bodies in nine districts scheduled in October. The main Opposition party in the state has alleged that the decision to conduct the polling in two phases was unjustified. “The election is conducted for only nine districts comprising only 14,573 polling booths. Therefore, there is no logic in conducting the polling in two phases on October 6 and 9,” the party said. This apart, the commission has not divided the nine districts into two parts for election to be conducted in two phases. In fact, in all the nine districts polling is scheduled on both the polling dates. For some panchayat union polling is scheduled in phase-I and for some other unions in the same district in phase-II, the party said. Noting that the time gap between the polling and the counting is quite long, the party said, “it is necessary that the ballot boxes are protected so that there is no tampering or rigging.” “The conduct of some of the members of other political parties during the 2021 assembly elections casted a worrying picture where even members of Rajya Sabha issued scathing personally attacking statements against AIADMK leaders,” the petitioner alleged. The plea is likely to be taken up for hearing by the first bench headed by Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee next week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/aiadmk-moves-madras-high-court-opposing-two-phase-civic-body-elections/articleshow/86310423.cms||---
---||World||Russia to open new frontier in space: 1st full-length film||MOSCOW: The first satellite in space, the first dog, the first man, the first woman and now - if all goes as planned - the first movie. Russia took a step closer on Thursday to claiming another record in space when a commission of medical and safety experts approved a plan for an actor and a director to blast off early next month to film the first full-length, fictional movie in space. The movie, "The Challenge," tells of a female doctor launched on short notice to the International Space Station to save the life of a cosmonaut. If filmed on schedule next month, it would beat Hollywood to low-Earth orbit. Nasa announced last year plans by Tom Cruise to film on the ISS. Russia's space agency, Roscosmos, then announced its movie ambition. At a news conference in Moscow, the Russian actor, director and their doubles - both roles have backups, lest a last-minute health problem derail the project - spoke enthusiastically about a new frontier in show business. They said they hoped to portray weightlessness as never before in fiction and, through the skills of a professional actor, the emotions of floating freely and seeing Earth from the heavens. "For the first two seconds it's scary," Yulia Peresild, who is on track to become the first actor in space, said of her training on an airplane flight that briefly created a microgravity environment. "After that, it's beautiful." She conceded that she will face limitations: She'll do her own makeup, for example, and work without lighting or sound crews. Peresild and Klim Shipenko, director on the primary crew, plan to fly up and back in a Soyuz capsule and spend 10 days filming in the Russian segment of the space station. It is not clear when Nasa plans to start its space film project, but Russia officials were concerned enough to shift a schedule of missions to accommodate the pair's hasty launch. Blastoff is planned for October 5. Anton Shkaplerov, a cosmonaut, will pilot the three-seat Soyuz spaceship. Shipenko said his aim is to bring to life the experience of space through the eyes of an ordinary person, the doctor character played by Peresild. "We want every person to be a little like our hero." Three cosmonauts will play bit parts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/russia-to-open-new-frontier-in-space-1st-full-length-film/articleshow/86310485.cms||---

Thereafter, they took out a procession at Gohana road in Jind town and burnt effigy of chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar for ignoring the demands of Dalit community.

After the meeting Devi Das, a Dalit activist who is leading the protest, said the district administration is offering a job under outsourcing policy and Rs 3 lakh compensation only. “We know if we accept a outsourced job, the victim would be fired next year. Therefore, we are seeking a job against sanctioned post, under outsourcing policy part-2. We will not carry out cremation of body until demands are met,” he added.

The intelligence-led operation was supported by the Border Security Force (BSF) as it was carried out in the border area. Punjab Police chief DGP Dinkar Gupta said the recovery of the consignment was made on the disclosures of Jasvir Singh alias Gaggu, a resident of village Mahalam in Fazilka, who was earlier arrested by the police. He said that the Punjab police under drive against drugs had managed to recover over 232 kg heroin during the last 100 days alone. Gupta said following inputs from the counter-intelligence wing about some people residing near Indo-Pak border indulging in smuggling of arms, explosives and drugs from Pakistan to India via international border, SSP Ferozepur Rajpal Singh registered the FIR against Jasvir on secret information and launched a massive manhunt to arrest him. The police managed to arrest Jasvir on Friday morning and during investigations he revealed that he, along with his associates, arranged one consignment of heroin from Pakistan via international border, which was concealed 15m away from the border fence. The DGP said that the police team, along with BSF, conducted combing operation around the location disclosed by Jasvir and recovered the consignment.

---||Gurgaon||Sham call centre busted in Gurgaon, 14th this year||Gurgaon: A call centre that allegedly cheated US citizens on the pretext of cancelling online orders that they did not even place was busted in Sector 44. This is the 14th call centre to have been busted by Gurgaon police this year. Almost all of them were targeting US citizens in the name of providing technical support, social security number and customer services on behalf of leading companies. The call centre busted on Friday was operating out of the basement of a building in Sector 44 for the past one month. A total of 32 youths, including 5 women, were hired for making the calls. The owners had neither had any licence for operating the call centre, nor details of mode of payment, source of customer data, etc. Police said the accused would collect the relevant data of US citizens from various sources and upload them on a system for sending out bulk voice messages. The caller would inform the victim about suspicious activity from their accounts on e-commerce sites and claim that a costly item had been ordered on their behalf. When the victims denied placing the orders, the accused would make them pay up for cancelling them. The owner of the call centre, identified as Jitender Sharma of Delhi, was arrested from the Sector 144 office itself. ACP (DLF) Karan Goel said the accused used to send 4,000 to 5,000 bulk voice messages to US citizens every day. The voice message read: “Hello this is an automatic call…. We have identified some suspicious activity on your account. We have restricted any financial activity on your account until and unless this is addressed. Please press 1 to talk to customer support, thank you.” Apprehensive of their account being misused, the victim would usually oblige. When they pressed 1, their call landed at the call centre in Gurgaon. The telecaller would ask the victims if they had shared their personal details with anyone. When the victims denied having done so, they were assured that the problem could be fixed. “The caller misled the victims about some virus and hacking of their phones. In the name of fixing this non-existent problem, the caller asked the targets to pay $200-500 through online payment or gift cards,” the ACP said. A case was registered against the owner at Cyber police station under sections 420 (cheating), 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC and sections 66D (cheating by personation by using computer resource) and 75 (any offence or contravention committed outside India by any person irrespective of his nationality) of the IT Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/sham-call-centre-busted-in-gurgaon-14th-this-year/articleshow/86307232.cms||Bagish Jha

Chadha’s remark was termed ‘misogynist’ and ‘sexist’ by some netizens while Congress leader Alka Lamba said it had exposed AAP’s anti-women mentality. In response to Sidhu’s video message accusing AAP of ‘drama’ of tearing copies of the farm laws but dithering from denotifying the law passed by the Delhi government, Chadha tweeted, “The Rakhi Sawant of Punjab politics – Navjot Singh Sidhu — has received a scolding from Congress high command for nonstop rant against Capt (Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh).

Has it been denotified or the masquerading is still going on?” Reacting to Chadha’s tweet, Congress leader Lamba said it showed AAP’s mentality towards women. AICC spokesperson Lavanya Ballal too commented, “The level of AAP Delhi, disgusting! sexist and misogynistic.” Some netizens also commented on Chadha’s post to object to dragging a woman into the political slugfest. Earlier, on March 22, chief minister Amarinder Singh had alleged that the Kejriwal-led Delhi government had already implemented one of the farm laws. Even in Punjab, AAP had taken a U-turn on the issue, he pointed out, asking the Delhi chief minister to stop poking his nose into “my state’s affairs, which I am capable of handling much better than you are doing in the national capital.” Not answered my question: Sidhu retorts Sidhu hit back at Chadha in the evening with another tweet, saying: “They say man descended from the apes and the monkeys, Looking at your mind Raghav Chadha I believe you are still descending ! You still haven’t answered my question about notifying the Farm Laws by your Government.” Takes on Sukhbir Badal Commenting on SAD president Sukhbir Badal’s tweet about SAD leadership courting arrest, Sidhu said: “BJP a lost cause in Punjab, trying to make a back door entry through their long term ally the Akali Dal… Desperate to make them heroes but they will remain Zeros in Punjab ….

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Supreme Court allows conduct of Plus-One exams in Kerala||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Supreme Court on Friday allowed the state government to hold physical exams for Plus-One course amid the Covid-19 pandemic. It expressed satisfaction over precautionary steps being taken by the government. Welcoming the decision, general education minister V Sivankutty said the exam dates would be finalised once the government received details of the court order. The time table will be published after holding discussions with all stakeholders. Dismissing an appeal filed by advocate Rasoolshan A challenging the high court order refusing to interfere with the state government’s decision to hold offline exams, a bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar and C T Ravikumar said the state had filed a detailed affidavit and it was taking all measures related to the coronavirus protocol. Third wave is not in the offing immediately: SCWe are convinced by the explanation offered by the state and trust authorities will take all precautions and necessary steps so that no untoward situation is faced by students who are of tender age and appearing for the proposed examination. Dismissed,” it said. The apex court said it had intervened on the earlier occasion as there was a possibility of a third wave of the pandemic by September. “A third wave is not in the offing immediately,” it said. The court had, on September 3, stayed the state government's decision to conduct offline exams for a week citing the pandemic situation. Prashant Padmanabhan, appearing for the petitioner, submitted that the state government’s affidavit does not spell out satisfactory reasons and answer questions put forth by the apex court. The court had asked the state’s counsel if the decision was taken after taking into account the increase in Covid cases in the state but the affidavit did not answer that or whether experts have been consulted on the issue, he said. The government had, in an affidavit, told the court that the conduct of examinations through online mode would adversely affect a large number of students who have no access to laptops, desktops or mobile phones. "Students from the lower strata of society depend on mobile phones or tablets for attending online classes... In many areas, internet connection or mobile data are not available. These students will never be able to write online examinations,” it said. Sivankutty said the examinations will be conducted by fully adhering to the Covid regulations. "The sanitisation procedures in schools will be undertaken in collaboration with other departments... There is no need for any concern for students or parents. A decision on reopening of schools also will be taken soon," he said. The minister urged those opposing the examinations to end their protests as majority students wanted them to be conducted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/supreme-court-allows-kerala-govt-conduct-of-plus-one-exams/articleshow/86310483.cms||---

Police said the 16-year-old stopped his motorcycle near the woman cop in the Khedi Pull area and started harassing her. However, he was soon detained by other cops after the woman officer deployed at Mahila Thana Central alerted her colleagues. “As soon as he was caught, the minor apologised for his behaviour,” an official said. To combat crime against women, Operation Majnu was launched. Women cops dressed in plain clothes are stationed in public places to keep an eye on harassers and subsequently nab them. In another case, the Faridabad police arrested a man named Sanjay in response to a molestation complaint received on Twitter.  The complaint was regarding the molestation of a few girls in Sector 37. According to the complainant, the men follow them and pass “crude remarks”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/faridabad/minor-detained-for-harassing-cop-in-faridabad/articleshow/86307249.cms||Sagrika Kissu
---||Chandigarh||Punjab cops bust SFJ module promoting secessionist activities||Chandigarh: The Punjab Police on Friday busted a secessionist module of banned ‘unlawful association’, Sikhs for Justice (SFJ), with arrest of its three members after seizing numerous secessionist pamphlets promoting ‘Referendum 2020’ activities, from their possession during a raid conducted at Rampur village in Khanna. SFJ was banned by the Indian government in July 2019 under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) for their involvement in promoting secession as well as militancy in Punjab as well as Sikh Referendum 2020. Those arrested have been identified as Gurwinder Singh of Rampur in Khanna, and Jagwinder Singh and Sukhdev Singh of Morinda in Ropar. Police have also booked Gurpatwant Singh Pannu, Harpreet Singh, Bikramjeet Singh and Gursahai Makhu, all based in the USA, and Jagjeet Singh Mangat of Khanna. Accompanied by duty magistrate, cops raided Rampur and seized over 2.84 lakh pamphlets on Referendum 2020 activities. They also seized a canon printer, spray pump and spray bottles for writing secessionist graffiti on walls, one laptop, three mobile phones and a Honda City car from their possession. Preliminary investigation revealed that Gurwinder was radicalised and motivated over a YouTube channel ‘US Media International’ being operated by J S Dhaliwal, who further introduced him to Pannu. On Pannu’s instructions, Gurwinder installed Khalistani flags on the premises of a government school in his village, said the police spokesperson. It has also come out that the accused has registered around 20-25 persons to vote for promoting Referendum 2020 besides distributing pamphlets for different groups in the vicinity of Doraha in Ludhiana district and providing money on the instance of Pannu. As per investigation, Gurwinder has written wall graffiti promoting Sikh Referendum 2020 activities (in English and Punjabi), under bridges and on signboards at various places on the Khanna-Singhu border stretch in Delhi. For promoting secessionist activities, the accused received huge funds from Pannu via human carriers, hawala and MTSS channels. The FIR in the case was registered on September 16 under various sections of the IPC, including sedition, and UAPA at police station state special operations cell in Mohali. Further raids are being conducted to arrest the remaining accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-cops-bust-sfj-module-promoting-secessionist-activities/articleshow/86307255.cms||---

The court then directed animal welfare organisation People for Cattle in India (PFCI), the state authorities and the Chennai corporation to decide on a course of action that may be followed both to ensure that IIT is rid of the menace of too many dogs on its campus and the ultimate treatment of the dogs taken from the campus. The first bench of chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice P D Audikesavalu passed the order on a PIL moved by PFCI alleging illtreatment of more than 100 dogs that are captured on IIT-M campus and lodged in three ‘dog parks’ in the premises. Pointing out the death of 49 dogs on the campus in a span of six months, the petitioner alleged that the IIT-M had failed to take care of the animals. Refusing to accept the argument, the bench said the Animal Welfare Board had filed papers, including a report, pursuant to continual visits. According to such a report, IIT-M has done its best for the dogs within its campus. “According to IIT, every dog on its campus is microchipped and three separate enclosures have been provided since some of the dogs are aggressive and impede movement within the campus,” the bench said. It is also possible, as the joint committee report suggests, that sheer ennui may result in aggressive behaviour or the large number of dogs may also result in aggression, the court added. Making it clear that the number of dogs on the campus must be reduced, the court said, “There could be a few dogs and, given the size of the campus and dogs being traditionally present, the number may be reduced closer to 50, since there are deer and black bucks also on the campus.” As to the allegation of the PFCI that health of 14 dogs being delicate and requiring special attention, the judges said it would be open to PFCI, along with any appropriate state agency, to move the sick dogs needing immediate care to any state-run veterinary hospital or private facility.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/iit-madras-campus-cant-turn-dog-park-says-high-court/articleshow/86310534.cms||Suresh Kumar

For this, a 32-km-long stretch will be developed to connect Khurja to Jewar, he said at a meeting with officials of the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) on Thursday. At the meeting with YEIDA officials, Noida International Airport Limited (NIAL) CEO Arun Vir Singh, nodal officer Shailendra Bhatia and Yamuna International Airport Private Limited (YIAPL) CEO Christoph Selman, Singh directed them to prepare the connectivity plan. The aim is to provide maximum connectivity to Jewar with neighbouring areas. “NHAI will prepare the feasibility report. The connectivity of NH-91 will be facilitated with the development of this road,” said Arun Vir Singh, YEIDA CEO. While NH-91 passes through Khurja, it is expected that this route from Khurja to Jewar will be repaired so that NH-91 can be accessed. The officials will also look at the possibilities of building a new road. While the existing road requires repair, once ready, it may bring down commute time to 40 minutes from the current 1 hour 22 minutes via MG road. Also, since the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway will cross Palwal, it will increase the connectivity via Palwal and Khurja to Jewar from the greenfield corridor. In another event on Thursday, Union minister of road transport and highways, Nitin Gadkari announced that a greenfield corridor will be built by spending Rs 2,100 crore to connect Delhi-Mumbai Expressway with the airport in Jewar. For this, the land acquisition work has been completed and a detailed project report (DPR) is in the final stages. According to Gadkari, about 15 projects worth Rs 53,000 crore related to the construction of roads and bridges have been approved in Delhi NCR. While work on 14 projects is in progress, Rs 2,100 crore of the total cost will be spent on developing the greenfield corridor to connect Delhi-Mumbai Expressway with the airport at Jewar. He said the work on this project will start this year. “With the completion of this project, pollution in Delhi NCR is expected to reduce along with a reduction in jam situations,” said an official from YEIDA. Further, work on connecting DND with Delhi-Mumbai Expressway via Faridabad and Ballabhgarh will be completed by 2023.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/airport-highway-link-30km-road-to-connect-jewar-to-nh-91-at-khurja/articleshow/86307313.cms||Meenakshi Sinha

BSP state president Jasbir Singh Garhi said according to seat-sharing arrangement with Akalis, BSP had got five seats from Majha — Amritsar (north), Amritsar (central), Pathankot, Bhoa and Sujanpur. Amritsar (north) was given to BJP’s expelled leader Anil Joshi after he joined the Akali party while the SAD(B) announced Raj Kumar Gupta from Sujanpur seat. “In exchange of Amritsar (north) and Sujanpur seats we got Sham Chaurasi and Kapurthala seats respectively,” said the BSP state president . However, he denied having any knowledge ongoing hearsay about Akalis eyeing the Pathankot seat too. “No, there is nothing like that, I have not heard of such rumours even,” he said. On September 13, SAD(B) president Sukhbir Singh Badal had announced the names of 64 candidates, including 11 from Majha. Names of six and three candidates were announced from Amritsar and Tarn Taran districts while one candidate each was announced from Pathankot and Gurdaspur districts. However, highly placed sources in BSP said in one of the recently held meetings, Akalis had given indication of wanting a Pathankot seat. “One of the senior BJP leaders from the region, who had also expressed his resentment against farm laws, could join SAD(B) like Anil Joshi and in that case Akalis want to keep the Pathankot seat reserved for him,” said sources, adding that party (BSP) leadership was ‘concerned’ with Akalis choosing seats for their own convenience ignoring BSP’s interests. SAD (B) leader from Gurdaspur Gurbachan Singh Babehali said, “Such issues will be discussed between BSP and SAD (B) state presidents and whatever will be the outcome will be revealed to media.” Babehali is SAD(B) candidate from Gurdaspur assembly constituency. BSP state general secretary Gurbax Singh Shergill said meetings were being held to finalise the names of party candidates from Amritsar (central), Bhoa and Pathankot assembly constituencies. Shergill himself was a BSP candidate from Amritsar (north), which was later given to Anil Joshi and Shergill was adjusted in the state body of BSP. Despite repeated attempts SAD (B) spokespersons Daljit Singh Cheema did not answer his calls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/akalis-eyeing-pathankot-seat-may-exchange-with-bsp/articleshow/86307315.cms||Yudhvir Rana
