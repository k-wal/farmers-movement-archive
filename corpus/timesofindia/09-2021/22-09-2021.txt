The HC bench of Justices R V Ghughe and SG Mehare while hearing public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Uttamrao Shelke said the "new Committee, which is alleged to have taken charge by dislodging the Committee that we had constituted, shall refrain from taking any policy decision, sanction expenditure and shall also refrain from making any appointments or inducting any new members, if any, until further orders’’. Shelke’s advocate P S Talekar said that the HC by its order of October 9, 2019, had noted that in 2012 in a PIL filed in 2011 the HC had "thought it fit to appoint a committee to supervise, monitor and look after the financial affairs of the Sansthan." The committee so constituted was consisting of the Principal District Judge, Ahmednagar, the Collector, Ahmednagar and the Chief Executive Officer of Shree Sai Baba Sansthan Trust, Shirdi. The HC had also directed then that any major policy decision for an amount of over Rs 50 lakh must be approved by the committee. The PIL said that the State has appointed a new Managing Committee for the Sansthan via a Notification dated 16.09.2021 which is termed as the Managing Committee. The committee took charge on September 17. The State AGP S G Karlekar said that once the charge has been taken by the new committee, the Court may refrain from passing any orders. The HC said, "We have no doubts that the State Government is empowered to appoint the Managing Committee for Shree Sai Baba Sansthan, Shirdi. However, the peculiar circumstances in which we had passed an order on 9th October 2019, …would indicate that this Court had brought a Committee into existence tosupervise, monitor and administer the Sansthan and its financial affairs."  It added, "When we had brought a committee into existence and had empowered it to function and administer the Sansthan, prima facie, no other Managing Committee could have dislodged the Committee that we had constituted, on the plea of the Government has declared the formation of the new Committee. In short, the new Committee could not have taken charge without obtaining orders from this Court as we would then be required to discharge the Committee that we had constituted." The State sought time and the HC posted the matter to September 23.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-new-committee-for-shirdi-sansthan-not-to-take-any-policy-decisions-till-further-orders/articleshow/86407762.cms||Swati Deshpande

The opposition provoked the public and tried to set the state on fire through violent protests. The rioters burnt the premises of various innocent businessmen. At that time, I had clearly said the coming generations of the violent protesters would have to pay for it,” Adityanath said while addressing a public meeting in Moradabad on Tuesday.  Adityanath also shared a tweet from his official Twitter handle after his speech in Moradabad: “Remember, if you burn the properties of innocent businessmen in UP then you would have to pay, which will be remembered by your coming generations.”  Moradabad, along with its neighbouring Sambhal and Rampur districts, has witnessed communal riots on multiple occasions, including during the anti-CAA protests. A roadways bus was torched and several private and government vehicles were vandalised in Sambhal. Police had registered over 200 cases for the violence.  Similar violence was reported from Rampur district where a mob attacked policemen and curfews had to be imposed in sensitive areas. Notices were served to 26 protesters in Sambhal and 28 in Rampur to recover the damages for the destruction of public and private property.  The CM assured the people that the BJP will always provide better law and order. “Every mother and sister will have safety and respect.”  On Tuesday, the chief minister inaugurated two oxygen plants in Moradabad, after which he said every BJP MLA in the state has completed development works of over Rs 1,500 crore during their present tenure. “In comparison, the Opposition parties' MLAs have nothing to do with the development of the state. For them, their self-development and the development of the Saifai family is everything.”  Adityanath also laid the foundation stones of development works of Rs 275 crore in Sambhal where the entry of the leaders of Bharatiya Kisan Union was restricted by the police and district administration. In Bijnor too, he laid foundation stones for a few projects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/yogi-rakes-up-anti-caa-protest-in-moradabad-accuses-opposition-of-trying-to-burn-up/articleshow/86408008.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Officials said the six students were shortlisted in the first phase of the scholarship programme and they would be admitted to five universities located in the United Kingdom. Under the programme, the government had proposed to sponsor 10 tribal students per year, covering their tuition fees, journey fares and other expenses while pursuing their Masters or higher degrees in foreign universities. In the next phases, students from the SC community are also likely to be included. In a statement, chief minister Hemant Soren said the scholarship was named in honour of Marang Gomke Jaipal Singh Munda, who was the first tribal student to study at the Oxford University in England between 1922 and 1929. “Later, Munda captained the Indian Hockey team at the 1928 Amsterdam Olympic Games and went on to win the gold medal for the country. Almost 100 years later, we announced the scholarship in memory and honour of the legendary tribal icon to support tribal students while pursuing higher studies abroad. This is the first such scheme in the country where a state is giving scholarships to students of the tribal society to study abroad. We hope that in the coming days, other students will also get inspired from them,” his statement reads.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jkhand-picks-6-tribal-students-to-sponsor-their-edu-overseas/articleshow/86407389.cms||ASRP Mukesh

France said the two leaders reaffirmed their common will to “act jointly” in an open and inclusive Indo-Pacific, in line with India’s relationship with the EU and the latter’s own Indo-Pacific strategy. Macron’s office added that this approach aimed to promote regional stability and rule of law, while ruling out any form of hegemony.

We are notThe two leaders also discussed the situation in Afghanistan. The phone conversation with Modi, and the French readout, was being seen as a message by an enraged France, for long seen by India as a reliable strategic partner, to the US and others who consider India one of their most important partners in the Indo-Pacific. Paris has also been upset that it was excluded from the AUKUS security pact, which the US has entered into with the UK and Australia, despite France’s strong presence in the region. Australia’s decision to walk out of an agreement with France worth $66 billion for conventional submarines, and enter into a deal with the US for nuclear-powered ones, has been described as a “stab in the back” by French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian.

Following his conversation with Indian foreign minister S Jaishankar last week, Le Drian also met his Indian counterpart at the UN on Tuesday. Indo-Pacific and Afghanistan were among the issues discussed. Modi and Macron also discussed the situation in Afghanistan, with France saying that “the authorities in power” had to sever their links with international terror, allow humanitarian organisations to operate throughout the country and respect the fundamental rights of Afghan women and men. India said in its own statement that the two leaders reviewed the increasing bilateral collaboration in the Indo-Pacific, and the important role that the India-France partnership plays in promoting stability and security in the region. “The leaders agreed to maintain close and regular consultations, in the spirit of the India-France Strategic Partnership, which both countries cherish deeply," said the Indian government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/macron-dials-modi-as-french-us-oz-ties-plunge-into-crisis/articleshow/86408735.cms||Sachin Parashar

Fans don’t have to change accommodations or take internal flights, while the longest distance between stadiums is approximately 70km, good enough to be covered on a single day while watching multiple games. “For a football fanatic, this will be a very intensive and compact World Cup,” Fatma Al Nuaimi, executive director of communications, Qatar Supreme Committee, told TOI early this week. The Fifa World Cup comes amidst the Covid-19 pandemic with financial gloom across the world. Many have lost jobs and businesses have suffered losses, so fans may not have enough to realise their dream, particularly in Qatar, perceived as a “rich country”. Al Nuaimi, however, feels Qatar would suit all pockets. “Qatar will be an affordable World Cup. We are working with different groups and trying to understand what are the misconceptions. For a lot of people, Qatar’s image is of a rich country, an expensive place. But we have different solutions, different options. “People may assume there are only five-star hotels (here), but we do have a variety of options that fans can choose from. There is five-star, three-star (accommodation), service apartments, camps in the deserts, besides cruise ships that will act as temporary accommodation,” said Al Nuaimi. Indians constitute the single biggest group among all nationalities who are resident expats of Qatar. Given its geographical proximity, India is expected to have a bigger contingent of fans than ever before. “We know historically, based on ticket sales from Fifa, that Indians are a big market for the World Cup. India is one of our strategic markets. We do believe the geographical location, with three or four-hour flights, fans can follow their teams and enjoy the game. Indians will attend in big numbers,” said Al Nuaimi. Significantly, more Indians made it to the Fifa World Cup in Russia than several of the 32 participating countries. According to data provided by Fifa, 19,352 tickets were allotted to Indian citizens during the World Cup four years ago with United States and China – among non-participating countries – leading the charts. When the next edition of the football spectacle kicks off in Qatar, India may well be ahead of the queue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-times-of-pandemic-qatar-2022-assures-affordable-world-cup/articleshow/86409640.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

---||World||Sequoia National Park's Giant Forest unscathed by wildfire||THREE RIVERS: The ancient massive trees of Sequoia National Park's famed Giant Forest were unscathed Tuesday even though a wildfire has been burning near them on the western side of California's Sierra Nevada for nearly two weeks.  "As of right now we don't have any damage to any of our trees," said fire information officer Mark Garrett.  Two lightning-sparked fires that merged have spread over more than 39 square miles (101 square km), feeding on other types of trees that also live on the high-elevation slopes of the mountain range.  Giant Forest is home to about 2,000 sequoias, including the General Sherman Tree, which is considered the world's largest by volume and is a must-see for visitors to the national park.  The fire recently entered the perimeter of Giant Forest near a cluster of huge trees called the Four Guardsmen but their bases had been wrapped in fire-resistant material and crews had raked and cleared vegetation that could help spread the fire, Garrett said.  Firefighting crews monitored as what was described as a "low-intensity fire" passed through and made sure it did not affect the sequoias, he said.  For decades, Giant Forest has been subjected to prescribed fires that are carefully set and controlled to burn away vegetation that could otherwise become fuel for a fire like the KNP Complex and allow it to become established.  The next-closest sequoia grove is Redwood Canyon, but it is at least 6 miles (9.6 kilometers) away and the fire would have to travel up and down terrain to get there, Garrett said.  "But like Giant Forest, that one has also seen prescribed burn treatments for several decades since the late '60s so that grove is also well-equipped to transform a high-intensity fire into low-intensity fire," he said.  To the south, another forest fire in sequoia country was showing minimal movement.  The Windy Fire in the Giant Sequoia National Monument area of Sequoia National Forest and on the Tule River Indian Reservation covered more than 42 square miles (108 square kilometers) and was 5% contained.  "The fire behavior is not as extreme as it was a couple of days ago," said Thanh Nguyen, a fire information officer.  On the Trail of 100 Giants, one tree known as the "natural bench" sequoia because of the shape of its base was confirmed to have sustained some burning.  Several sequoia groves have been impacted by the Windy Fire but it's not clear whether any other sequoia trees have been burned.  Nguyen said fire can move through a grove by burning other types of trees and vegetation rather than sequoias and assessments will come later.  The largest trees on the Trail of 100 Giants are on average 220 feet (67 meters) tall, 20 feet (6.1 meters) in diameter and 1,500 years old, Nguyen said.  "Those trees are beloved," he said.  Firefighters have been hand-digging control lines and spraying water to protect the trees and have worked to protect several evacuated communities. The only structure lost so far was the Mule Peak fire lookout structure, which burned in the early stages of the fire even though it was wrapped in fire-resistant material.  More than 7,500 wildfires have scorched about 3,600 square miles (9,324 square kilometers) in California so far this year.  Nearly half of that land - 1,505 square miles (3,898 square kilometers) - was burned by the Dixie Fire across five counties in the northern Sierra and southern Cascades region. It is the second-largest fire on record in California and was 90% contained after destroying 1,329 homes, businesses and other structures since July 13.  South of Lake Tahoe, the 342-square-mile (886-square-kilometer) Caldor Fire is three-quarters contained after destroying 800 homes and commercial properties. Highway 50, the main route between the San Francisco Bay Area and the south end of the alpine resort lake, reopened to the public on Tuesday for the first time in weeks.  Historic drought tied to climate change is making wildfires harder to fight. It has killed millions of trees in California alone. Scientists say climate change has made the West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/sequoia-national-parks-giant-forest-unscathed-by-wildfire/articleshow/86411116.cms||---

---||India||AUKUS a security alliance, not relevant to Quad: India||NEW DELHI: Ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s departure to the US, the government sought to allay concerns about possible dilution of Quad’s agenda by the US pact with UK and Australia, AUKUS, saying that the latter was a security alliance which was not relevant to Quad. Expanding on the agenda of the visit, which will see Modi’s first bilateral summit with US President Joe Biden, and also his participation in the first in-person Quad summit, foreign secretary Harsh Shringla said terrorism and the Afghanistan security situation will figure in the bilateral meeting with the US on September 24. “It will feature the current regional security situation following the developments in Afghanistan, our stakes as a neighbour and preferred and long-standing partner of Afghanistan. In this context, we would undoubtedly discuss the need to stem radicalism, extremism, cross-border terrorism and the dismantling of global terror networks,” said Shringla. This will be Modi’s first in-person meeting with Biden after he became US president. NSA Ajit Doval will also accompany Modi to the US. The issue of terrorism will also be addressed in Modi’s UNGA address on September 25 along with other issues like the pandemic and climate change. Shringla described the UN Security Council resolution 2593, which was adopted during India’s presidency on August 30, as an “important benchmark” set by the international community on the issue of terrorism in Afghanistan. The resolution called upon the Taliban to ensure that Afghanistan’s territory wasn’t used to target any other state. While concerns have been expressed on the dilution of Quad by the AUKUS announcement, Shringla said Quad and AUKUS are not groupings of similar nature. “Quad countries share the vision of a free, open, transparent and inclusive Indo-Pacific region. Quad has adopted a wide array of initiatives globally on issues like the pandemic, new and emerging technologies and climate change. AUKUS is a security alliance involving three countries. We are not party to it. From our perspective, it is neither relevant to Quad nor will it have any impact on Quad’s functioning,” said Shringla.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/aukus-a-security-alliance-not-relevant-to-quad-india/articleshow/86410550.cms||Sachin Parashar
---||World||Soul-crushing: US Covid-19 deaths topping 1900 a day||The Covid-19 deaths in the United States have climbed to an average of more than 1,900 a day for the first time since early March, with experts saying the virus is preying largely on a distinct group: 71 million unvaccinated Americans.  The increasingly lethal turn has filled hospitals, complicated the start of the school year, delayed the return to offices and demoralised health care workers.  "It is devastating," said Dr Dena Hubbard, a pediatrician in the Kansas City, Missouri, area who has cared for babies delivered prematurely by cesarean section in a last-ditch effort to save their mothers, some of whom died. For health workers, the deaths, combined with misinformation and disbelief about the virus, have been "heart-wrenching, soul-crushing".  Twenty-two people died in one week alone at CoxHealth hospitals in the Springfield-Branson area, a level almost as high as that of all of Chicago. West Virginia has had more deaths in the first three weeks of September - 340 - than in the previous three months combined. Georgia is averaging 125 dead per day, more than California or other more populous states.  "I've got to tell you, a guy has got to wonder if we are ever going to see the end of it or not," said Collin Follis who is the coroner in Missouri's Madison County and works at a funeral home.  The nation was stunned back in December when it was witnessing 3,000 deaths a day. But that was when almost no one was vaccinated.  Now, nearly 64% of the US population has received at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. And yet, average deaths per day have climbed 40% over the past two weeks, from 1,387 to 1,947, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.  Health experts say the vast majority of the hospitalised and dead have been unvaccinated. While some vaccinated people have suffered breakthrough infections, those tend to be mild.  The number of vaccine-eligible Americans who have yet to get a shot has been put at more than 70 million.  Many low-vaccination communities also have high rates of conditions like obesity and diabetes, said Dr. William Moss of Johns Hopkins. And that combination - along with the more contagious delta variant - has proved lethal.  "I think this is a real failure of society and our most egregious sin to be at this stage where we have hospitals overwhelmed, ICUs overwhelmed and hitting this mark in terms of deaths per day," Moss lamented.  New cases of the coronavirus per day in the U.S. have dropped since the start of September and are now running at about 139,000. But deaths typically take longer to fall because victims often linger for weeks before succumbing.  In Kansas, 65-year-old cattleman Mike Limon thought he had beaten COVID-19 and went back to work for a few days. But the virus had "fried" his lungs and he died last week, said his grandson, Cadin Limon, 22, of Wichita.  He said his grandfather didn't get vaccinated for fear of a bad reaction, and he hasn't gotten the shot either for the same reason, though serious side effects have proved extremely rare.  He described his grandfather as a "man of faith."  "Sixty-five is still pretty young," the young man said. "I know that. It seems sudden and unexpected, but COVID didn't surprise God. His death wasn't a surprise to God. The God I serve is bigger than that."  Cases are falling in West Virginia from pandemic highs, but deaths and hospitalizations are expected to continue increasing for as many as six more weeks, said retired National Guard Maj. Gen. James Hoyer, who leads the state's coronavirus task force.  Dr. Greg Martin, who is president of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and practices mostly at Grady Hospital in Atlanta, said the staff is buckling under the strain.  "I think everyone in 2020 thought we would get through this. No one really thought that we would still be seeing this the same way in 2021," he said.  In Oklahoma, Hillcrest South Hospital in Tulsa is among several medical centers around the country to add temporary morgues. Deaths are at an all-time high there, at three to four times the number it would see in a non-COVID-19 world, said Bennett Geister, hospital CEO.  He said the staff there, too, is worn out.  "They didn't sign up to be ICU nurses only to have people pass away on them," he said. "They signed up to be ICU nurses to take people to recovery and heal people from the brink of death."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/soul-crushing-us-covid-19-deaths-topping-1900-a-day/articleshow/86411888.cms||---

Foreign secretary Harsh Shringla said the issue had also been taken up by foreign minister S Jaishankar with the UK authorities. The friction point has arisen at a time when India-UK ties are seen on an upswing with the two sides working to complete a trade pact. The new rules are seen to seriously inconvenience Indian travellers. “The basic issue is that here is a vaccine, Covishield, which is a licensed product of the UK company, manufactured in India of which we have supplied five million doses to the UK at the request of the government of UK,” said Shringla, pointing to the inconsistency in the rules announced by the British government. According to the new rules, Indian travellers who have received both doses of Covishield vaccine manufactured by Serum Institute of India will be considered unvaccinated and will have to self-isolate for 10 days. “We understand that this is being used under the national health system, and, therefore, non-recognition of Covishield is a discriminatory policy and does impact those of our citizens travelling to the UK,” Shringla added. Sources said India will take reciprocal action against travellers from the UK if its concerns are not addressed by October 4, when the new British rules will come into effect. The foreign secretary said he has been told that certain “assurances” were being given by the UK that the issue will be resolved. “We have also offered to some of the partner countries the option of mutual recognition of vaccination certificates... We have to see how it goes. But if we do not get satisfaction, we would be within our rights to impose reciprocal measures," Shringla said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-warns-uk-of-reciprocal-steps-over-vaccine-discrimination/articleshow/86412068.cms||---

Thus I am convinced that the material on record suggests it is a case of false promise to marry which apparently vitiates the complainant’s consent,” Justice Sandeep Shinde said on Monday. He rejected the plea for discharge by the man who was booked in January 2013 for rape and cheating. Earlier, the Dindoshi court too had rejected his plea. In the FIR, the woman said that they got close in 2012 while working in a hotel. She said the man exploited her physically and mentally and when she conceived, he convinced her to abort and promised to marry her after two years. Later he avoided her. On her December 28, 2012, complaint, the police suggested counselling. The man assured he would marry her. On January 6, 2013, she withdrew her complaint. On January 18, 2013, he told the counsellor he cannot marry her. The woman then renewed her complaint. In the HC, the accused’s advocate Raja Thakare argued that it was a case of breach of promise and not false promise of marriage. He said since the horoscopes did not match and being a case of astrological incompatibility, relations could not be furthered. But Justice Shinde said, “There is sufficient material to suggest that since inception, the applicant had no intention of upholding his promise to marry the complainant.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/hc-horoscope-mismatch-no-reason-to-back-out-of-marriage/articleshow/86412523.cms||Rosy Sequeira

The girl alerted neighbours in Dibbur village near Yelahanka, who succeeded in rescuing her mother from the noose, but were unable to save her 12-year-old sibling. According to Rajanukunte police, the incident took place around 6pm. Police identified the dead girl as Divyashree. Her mother Varalakshmi is battling for life in hospital. Varalakshmi was depressed after losing her husband Puttaraju to Covid-19 two months ago and also suffered from spine-related problems for the past two years. She decided to hang her children and herself on Monday evening. As Varalakshmi and Divyashree were getting ready to die by suicide, her younger daughter Mugdha rushed out of the house. The girl began screaming for help, drawing neighbours’ attention. They entered the house, brought down the woman and her elder daughter and rushed them to hospital, where doctors declared Divyashree dead on arrival. Varalakshmi was admitted to the hospital. Hemanth Kumar D, gram panchayat member, said she was depressed over the sudden demise of her husband and was unwell too. Her 12-year-old daughter was helping her with daily chores. Woman was not strong enough to hang kidsPolice suspect Varalakshmi might have convinced her children that they should all commit suicide as she was not physically strong enough to take care of them. “The woman was not strong enough to even hang her children. We suspect the arrangement was for all the three to hang themselves,” police said, adding that the younger girl appeared to have got scared an the last minute and rushed out of the house. Rajanukunte police have taken up a case of suspicious death and further probe is under way to find out if the elder girl hanged herself or was hanged by her mother. Mugdha is staying with her uncles.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/girl-flees-as-mom-tries-to-hang-her-sister-dies/articleshow/86412564.cms||---

Sources said the stretch will connect Old National Highway 48 and a bypass arm of the new National Highway outside Haveri town. Soybean, cotton, jowar, groundnut, maize and horticulture plants are grown in this 200-acre parcel of land between the highways. According to farmers, in the absence of a motorable road, it is very difficult to transport crops when the harvest season starts in a few weeks. Of the 2.5km stretch between the highways, about 1km of road is tarred. The rest meanders through agriculture fields and vanishes out of sight. Though the road, once ready, is set to benefit 70 farmers, only 10-12 have contributed for the project which is expected to cost around Rs 6 lakh. At least 10 farmers have pooled in between Rs 10,000 and 30,000. They have raised Rs 2 lakh so far and hope to the rest flows in through campaigns. A civil contractor from the town has provided road-building machinery free for the project, which took off two days ago. DC Shettennavar told TOI that he has taken note of the issue and said since the road comes under the city municipal council’s jurisdiction, he would direct its officials once again.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/haveri-farmers-pool-in-money-to-build-1-5km-road/articleshow/86412570.cms||Basavaraj Maralihalli
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Cheat visits station to gift jackets to cops, slippers do him in||BENGALURU: A 24-year-old man seeking to be in the good books of cops walked into a police station on Monday to meet an inspector, only to get arrested in connection with two cheating cases. Naveen Kumar, a resident of BHEL Layout and from Nagamangala, ostensibly was at the station to give jackets to cops as a social service. A bachelor living alone, he claimed to be a supervisor with a contractor carrying out cable-laying work for Bescom, police said. Naveen had met a couple of Hoysala staff on patrol near Channasandra Road, RR Nagar last week, saying he wanted to gift jackets to cops. They had advised him to meet the jurisdictional inspector. Accordingly, Naveen showed up at RR Nagar police station on Monday morning and was sitting outside the inspector’s chamber. Crime staffer Ravindra UP noticed Naveen and felt his gait and physique were familiar. “Then I looked down and saw his slippers. They had a red strap. Immediately, I realised he was the suspect who had cheated a woman outside a bank in RR Nagar,” Ravindra told his seniors later. Ravindra alerted the inspector and others about his suspicion. Naveen was detained and questioned, and he spilled the beans in no time. On August 12, a woman had filed a police complaint saying an unidentified man had cheated her of Rs 30,000 she wanted to deposit in the cash machine of a bank near Nimishamba Circle earlier that day. “A man standing outside the kiosk asked me how much I wanted to deposit. When I replied, he told me he was in need of the same amount of money, but was unable to withdraw it from his account as he had reached the withdrawal limit. He told me he will transfer Rs 30,000 to my account and asked me to hand over my cash instead of depositing it. He took my bank details and entered them in his mobile phone. Then he showed me a message on his mobile reading ‘Payment Out’ and told me the transaction was successful. Trusting him, I gave the cash to him,” the woman said in her complaint. Police collected CCTV footage of the kiosk that the suspect had entered earlier with a mask on. He wore red-strapped slippers. During a divisional crime meeting held by DCP (west) Sanjeev Patil, the CCTV footage was screened. “The body of the masked suspect matched with the person sitting outside the inspector’s chamber. The slippers, which the accused had worn on the day of the offence, confirmed our doubts,” an investigating officer said, adding: “We have cracked two cheating cases with Naveen’s arrest. He had conned another person in Vijayanagar earlier using the same trick. We recovered Rs 55,000 cash from him.” Naveen told police he visited the station so that he could make friends in the department and seek their help if he got caught in future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/cheat-visits-stn-to-gift-jackets-to-cops-slippers-do-him-in/articleshow/86412573.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Bescom, BBMP, building owner booked for culpable homicide||BENGALURU: Three months after an eight-year-old boy trying to retrieve a kite from the rooftop of a building sustained electric shocks and died of burns, Viveknagar police have registered a case under IPC sections 304 for culpable homicide not amounting to murder and 304A for causing death due to negligence against officials from Bescom, BBMP and KPTCL, and the building owner. The boy’s father had alleged the first floor of the building, where his son was electrocuted, was an illegal construction. On June 20, Shishil Singh, second son of Prakash Singh, was flying a kite near his house. It got entangled in a branch and Shishil went to the terrace of a neighbouring house, owned by Anish, to retrieve it. “Shishil sustained severe electric shocks while trying to pull the kite. We shifted him to St John’s Hospital; he succumbed on July 23 after battling for life for over a month,” Singh said in his complaint. Singh went to inspect the spot last week. “I realised Anish had illegally built the first floor. The high-tension wires pass very close to the terrace and that was how my son was electrocuted. Had the illegal floor not been built, he would not have died. I blame officials from Bescom, BBMP and KPTCL for the illegal construction and my son’s electrocution,” Singh said in his complaint. Police said they have issued notices to the parties mentioned in the FIR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bescom-bbmp-bldg-owner-booked-for-culpable-homicide/articleshow/86412583.cms||---

These are mostly in localities on Bengaluru’s outskirts. On Tuesday evening, an SUV was stuck on a slushy stretch of Sarjapur Road, prompting the driver to get off the car and get it towed. “I wish it never rains in Bengaluru because driving an SUV on many roads turns risky. Only ATVs might suit Bengaluru roads,” said the SUV owner, requesting not to be named. On Monday, a car got stuck on the rain-ravaged Belathur Road. Given the poor condition of roads in their areas, residents of Belathur, Konanakunte, Anjanapura, Kempapura, Nallurahalli and Hosa Road are hoping Bengaluru doesn’t see more rain. “Even a brief downpour is enough to turn most roads into slush tracks, with people finding it impossible to ride or drive on these stretches,” said Vishnu Bellandur, member of Save Bellandur, a federation of Bellandur Resident Welfare Associations. “We pay a lot of tax, but never have roads. BBMP’s favourite response is 110 villages are still under development,” rued Karthyayini Narayan, a resident of Nallurahalli. Prashanth Sanjeeva, a resident of Belathur and active participant at ward committee meetings, said, “Lack of coordination between civic agencies is there for all to see. During ward committee meetings, engineers of different agencies such as Bescom, BWSSB and BBMP promise to finish work and fix the roads, but they never keep their word.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/slushy-roads-after-rain-a-nightmare-for-motorists-on-bluru-outskirts/articleshow/86412587.cms||Nithya Mandyam
---||Bengaluru||Truck on track: Absconding driver arrested||BENGALURU: Government Railway Police (GRP) on Tuesday arrested the driver of a truck that was abandoned on the railway track near Hebbagodi between Heelalige and Carmelaram and hit by Mayiladuthurai Express coming from Mysuru. Around 8.30pm on Monday, the heavy goods vehicle (KA02AE9110) trespassed on the railway track between Carmelaram and Heelalige railway stations. A major accident was averted after the loco pilot of train 06232 Mysuru-Mayiladuthurai Express noticed the truck and applied emergency brakes. However, the locomotive hit the truck, but there were no injuries or casualties. Byappanahalli railway police said the suspect was supposed to move on a railway under bridge (RUB), but found it filled with rainwater. So, he took a diversion and tried to cross the railway track at a closed crossing. But the vehicle got stuck on the track, resulting in the accident. “This railway crossing is closed for nearly eight years. The suspect thought he could easily drive the vehicle across the track. The truck got stuck on the track and he fled the spot after noticing an approaching train,” a police officer said. Police said they identified the owner of the vehicle with the help of its registration number. Based on the information provided by the vehicle owner, police identified the driver and arrested him. No foul play as per initial probe: Official“There is no foul play or sabotage as per initial inquiry,” said an SWR official. Though it was an old railway level crossing, which was closed several years ago, sources said there was no fencing or vertical posts to restrict vehicles or trespassers. “If there was a fencing or vertical posts, the vehicle couldn’t have got on to the track. It’s a wake-up call,” said a source. However, Bengaluru divisional railway manager (DRM) Shyam Singh told TOI: “This is a clear case of trespassing. This level crossing was closed in 2013. The driver used an illegal way and accessed it. Hundred per cent fencing is not possible. There is no flaw on the part of the railways. We will create awareness among the public on not to tresspass on railway properties.” Meanwhile, Karnataka Rail Infrastructure Development Enterprises (K-RIDE) is now taking up doubling work on the 48-km Byappanahalli-Hosur corridor. It is also investigating if the truck belonged to any of the contractors involved in the doubling work. Amit Garg, MD of K-RIDE was not available for comments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/truck-on-track-absconding-driver-arrested/articleshow/86412592.cms||---

The two leaders, according to a statement, "underscored the strong and deep friendship between the United States and Canada".  They also discussed "their shared commitment to strengthening the resilience and competitiveness" of their economies and coordinating their pandemic response.  Trudeau's Liberals won Monday's snap election, but failed after a hard-pressed campaign to gain an absolute majority in parliament.  Days before Canadians went to the polls, Trudeau received an endorsement from former US President Barack Obama, who tweeted: "Justin has been an effective leader and strong voice for democratic values."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-congratulates-trudeau-on-canada-election-win/articleshow/86412606.cms||---
---||World||After 11th death at Rikers this year, 4 NY House Democrats demand closure of jail, release of inmates||NEW YORK: Two days after another inmate of Rikers Island was reported dead at the facility, four members of Congress from New York on Tuesday demanded the release of other prisoners and closure of the city's troubled jail complex.  In a letter Tuesday to governor Kathy Hochul and mayor Bill de Blasio, Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Jerry Nadler, Jamaal Bowman and Nydia Velazquez called conditions at the jail "deplorable and nothing short of a humanitarian crisis".  The demand followed the 11th death reported at Rikers Island this year. The city's Department of Correction said an inmate died Sunday at the jail after reporting he did not feel well and was taken to the infirmary. His death came on the heels of both Hochul and de Blasio announcing plans to try to improve conditions at Rikers Island, where longstanding troubles were exacerbated amid the pandemic.  The Department of Correction, the mayor's office and governor's office did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.  The jail has failed to provide inmates with basic services and protection against the spread of the Covid-19, the members said, and lawmakers on a recent visit to the facility found conditions that were "life-threatening and horrific," the House members said in their letter.  Lawmakers reported overflowing toilets and floors covered in dead cockroaches, feces and rotting food. State Assembly member Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas said inmates told her they felt like they were being treated like slaves and animals.  It was not immediately clear from the letter whether the four House members were calling for all inmates, including those being held for violent crimes, to be immediately released or for some to be transferred to other facilities.  Ocasio-Cortez's office said the congresswoman believed that inmates should be released. Messages seeking additional information from the offices of the other House members were not immediately returned.  Of the 11 inmates who have died at Rikers Island this year, at least five died in suspected suicides. Officials have said deteriorating conditions at the jail came amid a slowdown in court proceedings, leaving more inmates incarcerated while awaiting trial, and chronic staff shortages.  At one point this summer, more than one-third of the city's jail guards were on sick leave or medically unfit to work with inmates. Some guards missed shifts without any explanation.  De Blasio announced measures last week that included requiring jail guards to get a doctor's note if they miss work for more than one day or face suspension without pay. Hochul on Friday signed legislation that largely eliminated the practice of incarcerating people for technical parole violations. The Democratic governor also said she was asking the state parole board to immediately release 191 people and move 200 sentenced inmates to state facilities.  Michael Skelly, a spokesperson for the Correction Officers' Benevolent Association, representing the jail guards, dismissed the letter.  "Closing Rikers is a talking point and not a reality right now. We have 6,000 inmates. There are no new jails built yet," he said. "Where are they going to go?"  He encouraged members of Congress concerned about Rikers to use their power to expedite building new jails, plans for which have been met with community opposition.  Skelly said those jails won't open until 2027 at the earliest and combined they'd have a maximum capacity of 3,300 inmates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/after-11th-death-at-rikers-this-year-4-ny-house-democrats-demand-closure-of-jail-release-of-inmates/articleshow/86412626.cms||---

The assessment is spurred by two sizable seizures of heroin made recently off the Gujarat coast. The officers said the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan has given a ballast of urgency to the drug mafia. Officers of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), and the Gujarat Anti-terrorism squad (ATS) confirmed that concentrated efforts are being made to push heroin produced in Afghanistan into India. The officers said that the smugglers are likely to use the sea route via Iran. Read AlsoVijayawada-based shell company used as front to smuggle Rs 20,900 crore Afghan heroinA nondescript house on the outskirts of Andhra Pradesh’s Vijayawada has suddenly become the talk of the town after the seizure of one of the biggest consignments of heroin at Mundra port in Gujarat last week.The officers said that the druglords fear confiscation of the heroin stock by the Taliban. Apart from staggering financial losses, the druglords also face the prospect of summary execution if caught by the Taliban, the officers said. These factors are fuelling drug runs into India, the officers said. Sources in the agencies said that the possibility of more heroin ships being caught in Indian waters cannot be ruled out. “The DRI found about 3,000kg of heroin at Mundra port and the investigation is underway,” a senior NCB officer said. “The heroin was smuggled from Afghanistan, which is the biggest producer of opium. The country has labs to process opium into heroin.” Read AlsoBiggest drug haul: How 3 tonnes of heroin worth Rs 20,000 crore seized in GujaratIn what is touted as the biggest drug haul from Gujarat and perhaps India, the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) on Monday declared the seizure of 2,988kg or close to 3 tonnes of heroin from two containers at Mundra port. The operation had been underway from September 14.Such huge stocks were never dispatched by the drug mafia, said the officer. “Their current push shows how desperate they are to dispose of their stock of heroin so that the Taliban don’t punish them or seize the contraband,” he said. According to the United Nations, harvesting of opium provided about 12,000 jobs in Afghanistan in 2019. It is also believed that the drug trade accounted for up to 60% of the Taliban’s annual revenue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/taliban-takeover-forcing-heroin-surge-into-india/articleshow/86412627.cms||Ashish Chauhan
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Governor B S Koshyari & CM Uddhav Thackeray engage in letter war over crime against women||MUMBAI: A fresh letter war erupted between CM Uddhav Thackeray and Maharashtra governor B S Koshyari over the recent Sakinaka rape and murder on Tuesday. After the governor wrote to him suggesting a special two-day session of the state legislature be held to discuss atrocities against women, Thackeray in his reply listed crimes against women not only in New Delhi, where law and order “is a subject under the Central government” but in other BJP-ruled states such as Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Gujarat and urged the governor to write to PM Modi and union home minister Amit Shah to call for a four-day session of Parliament to discuss the crimes. A similar letter war had flared up in October last year between the two, with the governor writing to the CM on reopening of temples and the CM hitting back. A week ago, a delegation of BJP women activists led by Chitra Wagh had called on Koshyari to voice their concern over atrocities against women in the state and demand that a special session of the legislature be convened to discuss the situation. Following this, Koshyari wrote to the CM, saying it would be appropriate if a two-day session were organized. Thackeray wrote in his four-page response that “at a juncture when the opposition is demanding a special session over the law and order situation, your decision to support the demand is threatening parliamentary democracy.” He added the governor’s suggestion would “create new disputes.” Referring to the “deteriorating” law and order situation in New Delhi and BJP-ruled states, Thackeray said, “Our government has taken steps to ensure that Sakinaka-type cases do not recur. In fact, atrocities against women and rape are a blot on society. In my opinion, such atrocities are a matter of national concern, so the matter should be discussed at the national level. In the recent past, even New Delhi has witnessed a sudden spurt in cases of atrocities against women. Law and order in New Delhi is a subject under the Central government.” Thackeray wrote that recently, a nine-year-old Dalit girl was gangraped and murdered in Delhi and to destroy evidence, the main accused and his accomplice performed the girl’s last rites. “It is quite shocking that the incident took place in the city which is the seat of the entire Central cabinet. A similar incident took place in BJP-ruled Bihar: An MP raped his own colleague, and an offence was registered against him only after the intervention of the court. We must compare the swift action taken by my government and the situation in New Delhi and Bihar,” Thackeray stated. Mentioning Uttarakhand, Koshyari’s home state, Thackeray wrote, “You have been leading Uttarakhand for a long period. I was told the state has witnessed a 150% increase in cases of atrocities against women as per official data. Should we demand a special session in Uttarakhand?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-governor-cm-uddhav-engage-in-letter-war-over-crime-against-women/articleshow/86412832.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

The explosion occurred around 4.30pm in a second-floor flat in Ashrith Aspire in SBI Colony, Devarachikkanahalli, near BTM Layout. The fire spread to an adjacent flat in no time. Both flats were occupied by the same family. The younger woman’s husband survived the blaze with burns and is said to be stable. As residents of the apartment and neighbouring building rushed out, they found flames leaping out of flats 210 and 211, occupied by the same family. Soon the fire turned into a massive blaze accompanied by thick smoke and the flames were touching third and fourth floors of the apartment. The older woman, Lakshmidevi, who was taking a walk in the balcony of one of the flats, was stuck as the space was sealed with iron grills. She could not get into the flat which was up in flames. She was seen crying for help as flames engulfed her. Her daughter Bhagya Rekha, too, was stuck inside the other flat, while son-in-law Bheemsen Rao, 66, managed to come out. Rao sustained burns as he tried to get the women out in vain. Rao has been admitted to a private hospital and is said to be out of danger. Rao’s elder daughter is in the US, and the younger, a bank employee, lives with her parents. The daughter, Preethi, and her husband, Sandeep, were not at home when the fire broke out. Rao and Rekha had returned from the US only on Monday evening. Heard her screaming, called fire brigade, says neighbour“We heard a woman screaming for help and banging the grills of the balcony. All of us watched helplessly as she was charred to death within a minute,” said Ravi Chandran, who lives on the same road as Ashrith Aspire, the apartment where an LPG leak killed two women on Tuesday evening. Ravi Chandran, a corporate employee, told TOI he went to his verandah at 4.15pm for a tea break when he heard a blast and saw smoke coming out of two second-floor flats. He heard construction workers near the apartment screaming and at 4.20pm, he called the fire brigade emergency number 101. “Within 10 minutes, we saw flames flying out of the balconies and one woman running to the edge and screaming for help. Around 4.45pm, the fire enveloped her and within a minute, she was charred to death. She was talking on the phone and pleading for help,” he said. He added that the grills had no opening for the woman to get out and the net on the balcony to keep pigeons out may have added to the blaze, he said. “All of us standing outside saw this helplessly and began crying,” he said, adding that fire brigade personnel reached the spot around 4.55pm. Four persons who tried to enter the flat to save the women rushed out crying because of burns, Chandran said. The charred body was on the balcony till about 8pm as fire force personnel found it impossible to find their way into the flat full of smoke. Most residents of the apartment took refuge in the nearby Janhavi Enclave as electricity supply to their homes was cut off and rescue operations were under way. Two Ashrity Aspire residents Naveen and Karthik said they were in their flats and did not hear the explosion. They came to know about the fire via their WhatsApp group around 4.15pm. They began evacuating women and children from all the flats and took them to the basement. Naveen, who lives on the same floor but a different wing of the flat that caught fire, said they faced no problem due to smoke and there was no panic. “We’re waiting for the all-clear to go back to our flats,” he said. A former resident of the flat, who reached the spot on hearing about the fire, was shocked. “I’m not sure if this is the same aged lady I knew.

Upper caste members sought the money for purification rituals but the district administration intervened and warned them, villagers said. Police said the Dalits, belonging to the Channadasar community, did not want to file a case as it would disrupt the harmony in the village. The toddler’s family visited the temple on September 4 to offer prayers for his birthday. “When his father was praying, the boy ran into the temple,” said a youth from the village, near Hanamasagar, who did not want to be identified. “Following this incident, upper caste members held a meeting on September 11 and imposed fine of Rs 25,000 on the father to hold a homa-havana to purify the temple.” Members of the Channadasar community approached police and sought action against those who imposed the fine. District officials held a meeting on Setpember 18. Gangavati DSP Rudresh Ujjanakoppal and Kushtagi tahsildar M Siddesh were present at the meeting, along with other officials. “They warned upper caste members not to repeat such incidents in the future and took Dalits inside the temple,” said a villager. “All necessary action has been taken by the district administration. Our DSP, tahsildar, social welfare official and others visited the village. A case has not been registered, with consideration for the social fabric. Had the officials found intentional or intractable misconduct, they would have booked a case,” said Koppal deputy commissioner Suralkar Vikas Kishor. Kushtagi circle inspector Ningappa NR, however, said despite 3-4 days passing after the incident, Channadasar community leaders refused to register a case. “They requested us not to file an FIR. When we considered a suo motu case, they said harmony in the village will be disturbed. So we conducted an awareness meeting in the village and obtained undertaking letters from upper caste members,” he said. Maruti Channadasar, a resident of Miyapur, said issue has been resolved as upper caste members have apologised for their mistake. “We are all living in harmony now and there is no practice of untouchability after this incident,” he said. Gururaj Desai, a social activist in Koppal, said the Channadasar community may have been pressured not to file a complaint. “As the boy is minor and poor, police should register a suo motu case to teach a lesson to all,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/dalit-family-fined-25k-as-kid-runs-into-temple/articleshow/86413245.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Online gambling bill passed; industry worried||BENGALURU: In a move to put an end to online gambling and betting, the assembly passed a bill on Tuesday amid concerns raised by industry stakeholders. Home minister Araga Jnanen- dra, who piloted the Karnataka Police (Amendment) Bill, 2021, said the existing law was inadequate to curb online gambling as it was a non-cognisable and bailable offence. The bill seeks to prohibit all wagering, betting, gambling of all forms, except lottery and horse race. The CM said, “Proposed law does not prohibit online games that strictly comply with games-of-skill features. The government, however, will deal with operators and abettors who run games of chance camouflaged as games of skill. Skill games that involve risks of the player losing money would also invite action.” Min: New bill provides for higher penalty  Congres lawmaker Priyank Kharge said the government should form a committee with industry stakeholders and come out with a law that curbs online betting instead of a bill that won’t stand the test of law. The home minister said: “Despite police booking cases and arresting people involved in such activities, the latter used to get bail with ease and restart their activities. The new bill will address these shortcomings and make the offence cognisable. The bill also provides for higher punishment and penalty.” Jnanendra said the bill will allow the government to raid those involved in illegal gambling. Chief minister Basavaraj Bommai said the bill is just the beginning of an attempt to curb online gaming. “As of now, there is no effective law to curb these activities. Under the current legislation, police had to take court’s permission even to raid gambling centres, " he said. Congress MLA Ramesh Kumar said several people were falling prey to online cricket betting, especially during the IPL season. Since the handlers of online gambling are sitting in remote places, how effective will this bill be in curbing this menace, he asked. “Hundreds of families have been ruined because of online gambling,” he said. Congress member Sharath Bachegowda said online cricket betting involved the role of foreign handlers, who needs to be tackled effectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/online-gambling-bill-passed-industry-worried/articleshow/86413251.cms||---
---||India||Channi govt set to quick-fix issues neglected by Captain||NEW DELHI: Taking a prompt from repeated surveys conducted by the party in Punjab, the new Congress government under chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi is likely to prioritise reworking of power purchase agreements, resolving the sacrilege case and take action against drug and transport mafia in the state. The surveys commissioned by the party showed these issues remained uppermost in people’s minds, even as persistent nudging of Congress managers failed to elicit action from former CM Amarinder Singh, who in fact said he was addressing the issues. This became a reason why the party leadership finally decided to go for a change, top sources said. The surveys were done at regular intervals and the persistence of the perception about inaction on these four issues in recent months raised alarm in Congress in view of assembly elections in 2022. Well-placed sources said the leadership was against the removal of Singh as a corrective given his stature in Congress party as well as his proximity to the Gandhi family. The appointment of popular and maverick Navjot Singh Sidhu as state unit president recently was devised as a via media to correct the party’s image and also trigger action from the government. An 18-point agenda publicly announced two months ago for Singh to take action was another way of jolting him into dramatic action but sources said he preferred the normal procedures on key issues. Sources said the expectation from Channi and his cabinet is of expeditious action on these four high-priority issues besides sending out the message that the government is on top of the problems. “When we received a memorandum from over 55 MLAs in which they said that they will not contest elections unless the leadership was changed, we could not have ignored it. There were fears that many of them may join other parties ahead of elections. That’s when the party decided that it was time to move on,” a senior leader told TOI. What had further enraged the MLAs was that those who complained against the CM to the Mallikarjun Kharge-led three-member committee on Punjab affairs, faced action from the state unit. TOI had reported in August that the AICC had conveyed to then-CM to assure the MLAs of fair treatment and that the onus of settling the dissent lay with Singh. After the drama of Singh’s ouster, there is hope in Congress that the new cabinet can renew the party’s perception with people on key issues while its social engineering will deliver on mobilisation among key demographics. The party has high hopes from the sprawling Dalit community after the appointment of the first chief minister from the group in the form of Channi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/channi-govt-set-to-quick-fix-issues-neglected-by-captain/articleshow/86413250.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Family of four attempts suicide over land dispute in Kurnool||TIRUPATI: A family of four attempted suicide near Chagalamarri in Kurnool district late on Monday. The family was disturbed over a long legal battle and alleged police and political intervention. Incidentally, the chief minister’s office had intervened earlier this month after a selfie video of the family went viral on social media threatening to end their lives if the dispute was not resolved. The family had named a police official and alleged that he had threatened them with an “encounter” killing. It may be recalled that M Akbar Basha, a native of Kurnool district, along with his three family members, had shot a selfie video describing their land dispute and appealed to the state government for help. The dispute related to the ownership of 1.5 acres of land at Yerraballi village in Duvvur mandal of Kadapa district. After the selfie video went viral on social media, chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy directed officials of the district administration to intervene in the matter and resolve the grievance immediately. However, Akbar Basha’s family attempted suicide on Monday night alleging that no action was taken by the officials to resolve the land dispute. They were rushed to a local hospital at Chagalamarri and their condition is said to be stable. Meanwhile, Kadapa SP KKN Anburajan clarified that it emerged during a recent inquiry conducted by additional SP M Deva Prasad that in 2018, a Mydukur local court had ruled the land title in favour of Akbar Basha’s aunt Khasim Bee, and the dispute as such was resolved then.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/family-of-four-attempts-suicide-over-land-dispute/articleshow/86406235.cms||Sandeep Raghavan

Dheeraj is also the president of Bihar Policemen’s Association. The EOU sources said the assets are worth 544% more than his known sources of income. The searches were conducted after registering an FIR on Monday and procuring search warrants from a special court in Patna. When contacted, ADG (EOU) Nayyar Hasnain Khan said a large number of land deeds, bank passbooks and documents pertaining to investments in LIC have been recovered. “His brothers and other family members have no source of income. The joint family is dependent on Dheeraj. All the properties are amassed from the ill-gotten money earned by Dheeraj by misusing his position and power,” he said. “We have come to know that Dheeraj also owns around 20 trucks, buses and other vehicles,” Khan added. “These are additional recovery about which there was no prior knowledge. Their values are to be ascertained. These will be added to Rs9.47 crore worth of disproportionate assets (DA) unearthed,” the ADG said. Khan said Dheeraj has a present monthly salary of around Rs52,000, including allowances. As per the EOU, Dheeraj joined service as a constable in Nalanda district police on May 13, 1988 and presently he is posted in Patna. The raids were carried out on Dheeraj’s two-storey private residence at Mahavir Colony in Beur, Patna, his paternal residence at village Muzaffarpur at Sahar in Bhojpur, his second brother Ashok Kumar’s residence in Arwal, a four-storey and another five-storey building in the name of Dheeraj’s third brother Surendra Singh and a five-storey house in the name of his fourth brother Vijendra Kumar Vimal, all on Bhelai Road at Krishna Nagar, a mall-cum-residence of his fifth brother Shyam Bihari Singh and a cement shop in the name of his sixth brother Surendra Kumar Singh at Narayanpur besides nephew Dharmendra Kumar’s shop named Ashutosh Traders, all in Bhojpur.

Reviewing the arrangements for the nine-day mega festival, Jawahar Reddy directed officials to make the best efforts to ensure the Srivari Brahmotsavams are celebrated with spiritual fervour and in a unique manner. The EO directed the engineering and electrical departments to set up giant electrical and floral depictions of various mythological forms of Lord Venkateswara and Sri Mahavishnu at different pilgrim congregation points across Tirumala. The TTD had already announced that the Brahmotsavams would be held in ‘Ekantham’ inside the temple premises this year as well due to Covid-19 restrictions and no procession would be taken out on the four mada streets encircling the main temple complex. Additional EO AV Dharma Reddy listed the most important days of Brahmotsavams, which include dwajarohanam on October 7, Garuda seva on October 11, golden chariot on October 12, rathotsavam on October 14 and chakrasnanam on October 15.

---||Vadodara||Fungus eating into historic gates||Vadodara: The ornate Laheripura Darwaja (gate) faced structural damage as the tin roof collapsed on Monday. But the historic over four-centuries-old gate that acts as an entrance to the walled city is facing biodeterioration for the past several decades. In fact, not just Laheripura Darwaja, all the four gates that guard the walled city in four different directions including Gendigate, Panigate and Champaner Darwaja are facing deterioration. The biodeterioration is speeding up due to heavy vehicular pollution besides pollution caused by nearby hotels, shopping and residential complexes. A study carried out by professor Arun Arya from M S University’s Department of Environmental Studies and Sanjay Prasad Gupta from the Raipur circle of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) had revealed that microorganisms are spreading organic and inorganic acids on the walls of the historic gates. The duo had published a paper ‘The accelerating effects of the microorganisms on biodeterioration of Laheripura gate at Vadodara city under air pollution’ — in a book ‘Anthropogenic pollution: Causes and Concern’ in 2016. The stone surface of the Laheripura gate became blackish in appearance due to deposits of dust, dirt and dried micro vegetation. The deposit covered area seems to be very old due to the formation of secondary dull green, pale, white lichens, present all over the stone surface, the researchers had noted. Due to the deposits, the aesthetic beauty of the monument has been affected. “Moreover, these depositions are very harmful to the stone surface. It is necessary to remove these accretions from the surface,” the study states. “The atmospheric pollutants provide initial food to the microbes to settle. The microbes continue to grow on such stony structures,” said Arya. The lifespan of microbes is more. Some microbes survive for 20 to 30 years, some other microbes survive for 60 to 70 years. “They remain dormant in extreme heat conditions but whenever the conditions are favourable they start proliferating,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/fungus-eating-into-historic-gates/articleshow/86405053.cms||Prashant Rupera
---||Patna||Mukesh Sahani in touch with Owaisi, Rajbhar to contest UP polls||PATNA: The Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) chief, Mukesh Sahani, has started looking for alliance partners to contest the Uttar Pradesh assembly elections due early next year. Sahani met Suheldeo Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) chief and former minister in the Yogi Adityanath government, Om Prakash Rajbhar, at Prayagraj on Saturday. SBSP is part of the Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha (BSM). Among the other constituents, the BSM includes the AIMIM led by Asaduddin Owaisi, who has announced to field his party’s candidates on 100 seats. Reports filtering from UP said Owaisi and Sahani were also closeted with each other at a hotel in Prayagraj, while Chandrashekhar Ravan, who heads the Azad Samaj Party (ASP), had in-camera discussions with him on the political situation and the prospects of coming together. The VIP is among the three parties from Bihar which are bracing up to contest the UP assembly elections. The two other parties are the JD(U) with CM Nitish Kumar as its leader and the Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) led by former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi. The JD(U) might also contest 200 seats in UP. The Manjhi camp has been claiming to be in cahoots with the BJP after the death of LJP founder and former Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan, a well-known Dalit face in the country. The BJP is supposedly in need of a Dalit face, because the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief and former CM Mayawati has lost her political edge and is talking about “sarvajan” (all sections) support to stay in the fray. As announced by Sahani, the VIP will contest 165 assembly seats in the eastern UP districts, which constitute the Poorvanchal region. However, the figure initially put forward by Sahani is subject to a lot of ‘ifs and buts’ and might change in the future when the seat-sharing talks begin after the decision is made as to which alliance or morcha the VIP will join. Sahani, who is a Nishad (fishermen) caste leader and also the animal husbandry and fishery resources minister in the Nitish Kumar government in Bihar, is in the Bihar NDA as a partner of the BJP. He released 71,000 spawns of fishes in the Ganga on Friday to mark the celebration of 71st birthday of PM Narendra Modi and the next day reached Prayagraj on a political exploratory mission. Whether Sahani’s alliance with the Owaisi-Rajbhar axis will be of help to the BJP or to the VIP’s stakes is another matter, observers feel. The BJP is already in seat-sharing talks with the more strongly placed Nirbal Indian Shoshit Hamara Aam Dal (NISHAD) Party in UP. The Nishad Party that has a Lok Sabha MP has its base in the Poorvanchal region and claims the support of such caste and communities as Nishad (fishermen), Majhwar, Kewat (boatmen) and Mallah (boatmen).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/mukesh-sahani-in-touch-with-owaisi-rajbhar-to-contest-up-polls/articleshow/86407124.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Patna||Jitan Ram Manjhi questions Ramayana story||PATNA: The BJP suggestion that the Ramayana and the story of Lord Ram should be included in the school syllabus of Bihar, as has been done in Madhya Pradesh (MP), faced an immediate hurdle from within the state NDA, as former CM and Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) chief Jitan Ram Manjhi on Tuesday questioned the historicity and existence of Lord Ram itself. “I don’t consider the Ramayana to be a true story. Nor do I think that Lord Ram was a great man or a great historical person. I don’t consider the Ramayana story to be true,” Manjhi said when mediapersons sought his opinion on the suggestion made by BJP minister in the Nitish Kumar government, Neeraj Kumar Singh Babloo, that the teachings of the Ramayana should be included in the school syllabus in Bihar, like it has been done in MP. “When I was a child, I used to listen stories from the Ramayana or from the life of Lord Ram as narrated by my grandmother. If the teaching of the Ramayana or Lord Rama is included in the school syllabus, I or for that matter all others, would not need to listen to those stories from our grandmothers,” the minister told mediapersons on Tuesday. The RJD took a jibe at the BJP and asked it to look into its own NDA camp on the matter. “The BJP should first take note of what its own NDA partner thinks on it,” RJD spokesman Mrityunjay Tiwari said. The state BJP said the story of Lord Ram and the Ramayana could not be “erased from the life of the people of the country,” and also upbraided both Manjhi and the Congress led UPA at the Centre that was in power. “No one can erase the story of Lord Ram from the life of the people of the country, as it is a part of their faith. Manjhi also cannot deny the story of Lord Ram and the Ramayana,” state BJP spokesman Prem Ranjan Patel said. “Earlier, when the UPA was in power at the Centre, it had also denied the story of Lord Ram and the Ramayana, but the Archaeological Survey of India did the excavation work at the site at Ayodhya and found the remains to contain the evidence about the existence of a Ram temple there. Later, the Supreme Court gave its verdict in favour of the construction of Ram temple there,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/jitan-ram-manjhi-questions-ramayana-story/articleshow/86407185.cms||Abhay Singh

One side of the road was closed for traffic but the dust spread to other side as well,” said a shop owner in nearby complex.  Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) officials claimed that they did not receive any complaint about any issue created at the spot. It is mandatory for any developer to cover the spot of construction or demolition properly so that it does not create disturbance in adjoining areas. “I will inquire if there was any negligence while undertaking the demolition work. The work is being done by contractor. We did not receive any complaint,” said an official in South West Zone of SMC. “The building was old and weak. SMC is redeveloping the fire station and quarter complex in the same campus along with infrastructure for metro,” the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/majura-gate-fire-station-residential-quarters-razed/articleshow/86405302.cms||---

Choudhary is the cousin of Begusarai Sadar MLA Kundan Singh and Kundan is son of Begusarai municipal corporation Mayor Upendra Prasad Singh. He said the police team had recovered the weapon from the house of one Manjesh Kumar, who is Nandan Choudhary’s driver. “Two loaded magazines, 188 round of live cartridges, a motorcycle and a mobile phone were also recovered from Manjesh. However, during police interrogation he revealed that the weapon and all the ammunitions actually belonged to Nandan, who is a property dealer and had asked the former around a year ago, to keep the ammunitions with him,” the SP said, adding that Nandan is absconding after the raid. “Though police are investigating the case with all possible angles it’s only after the arrest of Nandan, that anything conclusive could be said in the case,” the SP said. The SP, however, said that the investigation done so far in the case finds no link with the MLA. The SP said he had constituted a special police team headed by Begusarai Sadar SDPO Amit Kumar to raid the place. Though the BJP MLA could not be contacted as his mobile phone remained constantly busy but the Mayor said he had no connection with the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/seized-ak-47-belongs-to-begusarai-mlas-kin/articleshow/86407351.cms||---

The rates are part of a festival scheme for those who avail of disbursement by end-October. As a result of this revised policy, salaried borrowers could see their interest rates come down by 45 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point) and creditworthy self-employed borrowers seeking loans above Rs 75 lakh would see their interest costs drop by up to 60bps. HDFC has traditionally been charging higher interest rates for self-employed borrowers. Keki Mistry, CEO, HDFC, told TOI that liquidity continues to be good and demand for housing remains strong. “Individual home loans in June were 79% higher than May and July was 14% higher than June and 64% higher than July of last year and the momentum continues to remain strong,” he said. HDFC is seeing demand is across the board including cities, where prices have been flat since 2017. “Several factors are pushing up demand. Property prices have generally not gone up in Mumbai and Delhi, while income levels have over the last three years. Also, interest rates are at an all-time low,” said Mistry. He added that there is also a feel-good factor with stock markets being at an all-time high, which has improved confidence. “The Covid factor increasing the demand for larger homes, due to multiple family members having to work from home continues to support demand,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/hdfc-home-loans-start-at-6-7-tied-to-credit-score/articleshow/86410359.cms||---

The victim Digatsinh Rathod, 35, consumed some poisonous substance in front of his wife Payal at their house in New Rajdeep Society on Monday night. While the couple had been quarrelling over the issue for the past many months, push came to shove when Payal approached the Mahila police station on Sunday and filed an application for complaint over the issue. She stated in her application that Rathod had been unwilling to buy a new phone for their son, who studies in Class III. A woman cop then called the couple on Monday evening and talked to Rathod, who said he was facing a financial crunch and it was not possible for him to spend on a phone. Rathod runs an auto garage and also rents out vehicles. Payal used to tell him to leave his phone at home so that their son could attend online classes, but Rathod argued that sans mobile his business would get affected. However, Payal remained unrelenting, which resulted in frequent fights between the couple. “We suspect that Rathod purchased some poisonous substance on the way back home from the Mahila police station and took the drastic step in front of his wife,” said an official from Rajkot Taluka police station. The deceased’s father Pravinsinh also told police that a new mobile phone for their son had been the reason for fights between the couple. Moreover, the fact that his wife approached police over this apparently minor issue also hurt Digatsinh who was feeling guilty over not being able to buy a new phone for his son.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/unable-to-buy-mobile-for-son-35-yr-old-ends-life/articleshow/86405511.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Generations of families choose to be clinical trials guinea pigs!||AHMEDABAD: They earned Rs 100 to Rs 200 picking up rags. So, years ago, when agents arrived in their locality and offered them thousands of rupees to take part in clinical trials, residents scrambled to take up the offer – Rs 5,000 was more than they’d earn after a month of hard labour. Currently, members from nearly half of the 250-odd families of the Lal Bangla-Nehrunagar locality in Hatkeshwar area in east Ahmedabad regularly volunteer to be guinea pigs for clinical trials for drug testing in humans for Rs 5,000-20,000 payout depending on the trial. Ironically, despite many reeling under health complications, lack of good job opportunities has lured even the second generation to risk their lives for survival's sake! The Makwana family is a case in point. Two decades ago, Shakri Makwana, who was recently widowed and left with the responsibility of single handedly raising her son, dared to sign up for a clinical trial. The widow decided it was worth the risk for a handsome payout of Rs 5,000 offered which she could use to educate her only son Sanjay. When nothing majorly untoward happened to her, an emboldened Shakri signed up for 15-odd trials over the years. Today, repeated experiments have taken a toll on her health. "She is not my healthy, happy mother. She began suffering constant dizziness, weakness, fever and even memory loss. She is a mere shadow of herself," says son Sanjay. Ironically, Shakri's ill health forced Sanjay to drop out of school and take up rag picking but Rs 50-100 per day was not enough to put food and medicine on their plates. So when an agent approached Sanjay to be part of a clinical trial, Sanjay signed up. "I needed money for my mother's treatment and also for my marriage," he says. Sanjay started going for trials in 2015. “I would get Rs 5,000 for each trial. I could never earn that much rag-picking. With the money I gathered from the trials, I conducted my marriage. Later my wife Jashi, too, started participating in the trials,” says Sanjay. He confesses his health has taken a major beating due to repeated drug experiments. “I would experience high fever, nausea and headaches following the trials. Earlier, I could walk for 6-8 km to collect plastic waste and rags. I constantly feel giddy and also suffer from fits,” he adds. Naresh Makwana and his father Prakash, who live in the locality, have undergone clinical trials near Gota. “My father began going for these studies and I joined later as we wanted to make a pucca house and get my sister Bela married,” says Naresh, who developed rashes on the skin and intermittent fever following the trials. His sister Bela, too, took part in the studies and suffers from gynaecological and gastro-related issues. “Due to my poor health, I am still unmarried at the age of 32,” she reveals. Lakshmi Vaghela, a local who volunteers for an NGO, says the locality which has residents mainly dependent on rag picking for a living is a fertile point to recruit poor people ready to test experimental drugs for a price. “It is tough for people to earn a livelihood. This enables agents of clinical research organizations to easily recruit them into taking part in clinical research which they call ‘study’,” says Lakshmi. According to Lakshmi, entire families have been caught in this trap. “There are around 80 to 100 persons in the locality who often undergo clinical research signing on the dotted lines but seldom being aware of possible health complications. Multiple generations have become involved in this as they cannot take proper jobs and reel under health complications,” she said. Like Lakshman Naikar who has become an insomniac, becomes breathless on doing lightest of chores and constantly complains of body pain. “I was a tailor and had migrated from Pondicherry to Ahmedabad last March f0r better prospects. However, due to the Covid-induced lockdown, I failed to get any business. When I was struggling for money, someone asked me to take part in a clinical trial for money. I went to the place he suggested, took part in the experiments, got money, and returned home. Since then, my health has been in shambles. I can barely move without my body hurting badly,” he says. Activists stressed that the government should provide jobs, education and healthcare to the poor so that the next generation does not fall into the same trap for a few thousand rupees.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/generations-of-families-choose-to-be-clinical-trials-guinea-pigs/articleshow/86407842.cms||Ashish Chauhan

The Centre is keen to address the concerns of a flood threat in the two states before the completion of the first phase of the project, sources said. A team of officials from the Central Water Commission (CWC), Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Odisha will be deputed to take up a study in both states. The Centre has also directed Odisha and Chhattisgarh to conduct public hearings in the identified villages that are expected to be submerged following the construction of flood banks to Sabari and Sileru, major tributaries of the Godavari. The flood banks have been proposed to prevent flooding from the Polavaram project backwaters. Meanwhile, the AP government has assured that it would not store waters in the project till the completion of the study in areas facing the flood threat. However, the Centre turned down Odisha and Chhattisgarh’s demand for a fresh public hearing to assess the flood threat when the Godavari receives a maximum inflow of 58 lakh cusecs instead of the present design of the Polavaram project that can release 50 lakh cusecs. The Odisha government referred to an IIT Roorkee report that states the Godavari would receive about 58 lakh cusecs of flood waters once in 500 years while the Polavaram project spillway was constructed to release only 50 lakh cusecs. “In such an event, there would be massive flood in Sabari and Sileru, resulting in submergence of vast extent of areas in Odisha,” said Odisha irrigation secretary Anu Garg. However, the CWC turned down this contention, stating it had conducted a comprehensive study on the anticipated flood level in the Godavari before giving its final nod to the design that would handle 50 lakh cusecs of water. In fact, the AP government promised to construct a flood bank to avert floods in the two states and pay compensation for relief and resettlement work. AP has proposed to take up work on a flood bank with a length of 30.2 km at a cost of Rs 378 crore. Similarly, a 29.12-km-long flood bank will be constructed at a cost of Rs 332 crore in Chhattisgarh. Polavaram Project Authority (PPA) CEO Chandraskhar Iyer brought the issue to the notice of Union jal shakti ministry secretary Pankaj Kumar that Odisha and Chhattisgarh were not conducting the public hearings despite repeated appeals. He said the construction of flood banks would be taken up soon after completion of the public hearings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/panel-to-address-polavaram-flood-threat-fears-in-2-states/articleshow/86406356.cms||Samdani MN
---||Business||‘Govts must accept what they don’t do well, like banking’||NEW DELHI: JP Morgan’s longest serving CEO Jamie Dimon is a regular visitor to India where his firm has 40,000 employees, most of them doing global work. Since the pandemic, he is back on the road and has made a couple of trips to Europe and is hoping to visit India in six to nine months. In an online interview with TOI, he shared his assessment of the global economic situation and India. Excerpts: How do you see the state of the US economy, particularly in light of (US treasury secretary) Janet Yellen’s statements, saying that there is a risk of default?In the US, the Delta variant is kind of a wet blanket, but the economy is doing quite well. The rest of this year is going to grow something like 5-6%. The table is set rather well, consumers are in very good shape, they have a lot of extra cash, they have paid down debt. Usually, when debt gets paid down, it’s a sign of a recession. This is more a sign of the pump being primed. The spend today is 20% over what it was pre-Covid. Travel is coming back up, albeit slower. Even if they spend at this level, confidence is going up equally. Companies are in very good shape. There is a lot of cash and a lot of capability. Capex is starting to go up again, because of the demand. The debt ceiling — we’ve had this before. It’s irresponsible on our part to even get close to it. No one assumes there will be a default. If we did, that would be bad, but I think they’ll get over that. So you don’t see any risks right now?There are always risks, but people sometimes overestimate the risk just like sometimes they underestimate them. Geopolitics has always been a risk. The biggest geopolitical risk today is China. But that won’t necessarily derail the economy. And while we are coming out of the Delta variant, if you have another deadly variant, all bets are off on that one. So, hopefully, that won’t happen. Which are the economies you’re bullish on? How do you look at China the way things are unfolding there?America is coming out of it…pretty good growth, which can go on for a while. I think Europe is probably six months behind us. For the rest of the world, you really can’t put it in one category because every country is different. But in general, the more developed markets look okay. China’s growth has slowed. But the real issue with China is people got to look a little bit more long-term, and they do a pretty good job managing their economy. The big fear in the market is inflation and the withdrawal of all the liquidity that is floating around...It is a legitimate concern. The world has embarked on massive amounts of quantitative easing and fiscal stimulus. They are powerful drugs into the system and drive growth in slightly different ways. We need growth. Growth is the antidote for everything. Inflation is probably a transitory piece. It is currently 3.5% or 4% and as they start to taper, you’ll read about it. It’ll be November, December, January, based upon the Delta variant. But if that happens, and inflation goes up, long rates will go to 3% or 3.5% over the next 18 months or so, we’ll be fine. Growth is far more important than that inflationary number or bond rates going up. The stock market anticipates healthy growth and earnings. The bond market may not anticipate that, and that may be because the flows of money and liquidity are so high — it’s like a tsunami coming over them. So, I expect rates to go up. I’ve been wrong on that one before. But we’ll see. Have your plans for India changed after Covid? Absolutely not. India has a great long-term growth capability. And how good that growth will be, will be predicated upon the seriousness and detail of your policies and the implementation of policies. JPMorgan invests for the long run. The bankruptcy code, taxes and reducing bureaucracy & building infrastructure and privatising are critical to growth. I still say that India has great long-term potential. We have 40,000 employees and we have built massive centres. We just finished one in Hyderabad, which will eventually have 8,000 people. The policy you implement over the next 10 or 20 years will determine the growth rate. A healthy rate of growth is good for all your citizens. The Indian government has announced a very ambitious asset monetisation and divestment programme that needs about $80 billion. Do you think there’s an absorption capacity for this?I do. It’s not the money, per se, it’s the regulations. It is the transparency, the ability to buy and sell freely. it is the consistency of law. It makes a lot of sense to sell a lot of assets. Governments should acknowledge the things they don’t do well. Like banking. If you start making loans for political purposes, they will be bad loans. I’m optimistic because your government has generally tried to do the right things, and this is one of them. India could attract a lot more foreign direct investment, if it does a lot of things properly around financial market transparency, international banks, etc. Bank privatisation is part of the agenda for the first time. How do you see this?It relates to what rules are imposed upon those banks. Can you operate them properly? Do you have constraints? It’s not just privatisation. Transparency, rule of law, ability to operate governance, accounting, all those various things — if they do it right, you could have very vibrant banks. People tend to think that’s just good for the wealthy. But it’s really good for the lower-income, jobs and wages go up with healthy economies. And then you can also afford a lot more social programmes. I’m very supportive of ways in raising minimum wages in the US, but if you don’t do it wisely, it will be worse in the long run. There’s a debate happening here on bitcoins and cryptocurrencies, whether they should be banned or regulated... How do you view this?I don’t really care about bitcoin. I think people waste too much time and breath on it. But it is going to be regulated. Governments regulate just about everything. I don’t know if it’s an asset. I don’t know if it’s foreign exchange. I don’t know if it’s a currency. I don’t know if it’s the securities laws, but they’re going to do it. And that will constrain it to some extent. But whether it eliminates it, I have no idea and I don’t personally care. I am not a buyer of bitcoin. I think if you borrow money to buy bitcoin, you’re a fool. That does not mean it can’t go 10 times in price in the next five years. But I don’t care about that. I learned a long time ago figure out what you want, do what you want and be successful yourself. I remember when beanie babies were selling for $2,000 a pop. We all know about tulip bulbs. We all know about internet stocks. Speculation happens in every market around the world, including in communist countries. So, I don’t know why there is a surprise with a lot of speculation, particularly when there’s as much liquidity in the system.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/govts-must-accept-what-they-dont-do-well-like-banking/articleshow/86410431.cms||Mayur Shetty

Today, those memories belong to a bygone era as the stadium lies in a sorry state, a reminder of the absence of quality sports stadiums and infrastructure in the city. Australia’s Mark Waugh made his first century (130) in the WC cricket match in Vizag city in February 1996. The stadium, which is under the control of the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC), has long been crying out for attention. A persistent problem in the monsoon is waterlogging, when a foul smell emanates from the section of the stadium under water. The Visakhapatnam District Cricket Association (VDCA) had been maintaining the stadium for several years during which it hosted international cricket matches. Following the construction of the ACA-VDCA cricket stadium at PM Palem in 2003, the VDCA entrusted the municipal stadium to the GVMC. Since the VDCA gave up control, the stadium has hosted a couple of major political meetings but no major sports events. Though the city does not have sports grounds, the municipal stadium has been neglected, forcing aspiring sportspersons to look elsewhere. While the civic body has spent large sums on the stadium’s renovation, little has changed on the ground. “If the GVMC agrees to give us the stadium, we will develop it with our own funds by upgrading the pavilion building and making the red soil stadium into green turf as per standards to promote and organise national football events in the stadium. Though we are ready to conduct the prestigious Santosh Trophy Senior Men’s National Football Tournament for 2021-2022, there is not a single suitable (green turf) stadium in the state. If the stadium is developed as a green turf one, it will be useful for conducting coaching, leagues, and a day academy. We have approached the civic authorities and are waiting for their response,” said Kosaraju Gopalakrishna, president, Andhra Pradesh Football Association (APFA). Cricket buffs in Vizag and its surroundings have seen legends such as Vivian Richards, Sachin Tendulkar and Mark Waugh playing in the municipal stadium. “As of now, VDCA has not taken any decision to develop the municipal stadium. No one from the GVMC has approached us for the renovation,” said K Parthasaradhi, secretary, VDCA, adding, “The stadium has a rich past, but is now in a dilapidated condition.” When asked, Y Srinivasa Rao of GVMC (sports wing) said the fate of the stadium depends on the decision of the newly-elected council body. “The renovation of the stadium requires a large amount of money,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/the-game-no-longer-goes-on-at-this-iconic-stadium/articleshow/86406294.cms||Nalla.Babu

Former Union minister and Patna Saheb MP Ravi Shankar Prasad, along with state information and technology minister Jibesh Kumar and minority welfare minister Mohd Zama Khan, virtually launched the new courses at C-DAC. Shankar, in his message, said, “It is a dream come true for me to see the setting up of the country’s 12th centre of C-DAC. When I was the Union IT minister, I had tried hard to get this centre in Bihar. This will create new opportunities for the youth of the state. Around 100 students belonging to the SC, ST, OBC and minority communities have been sponsored by the state government to receive high-end training in these emerging technologies at C-DAC Patna centre. This will enable them to avail better job opportunities.” Jibesh said it was yet another step in line with the campaign -- ‘Invest IT Bihar’, which encourages investors to invest in Bihar's IT sector. “The technically skilled youth with C-DAC certification will be an encouragement factor for investors because they will have access to highly skilled and employable labour in the state itself,” he said. Digha MLA Sanjeev Chaurasia inaugurated the ACTS by pressing the button. He praised the efforts of Prasad and state development commissioner Amir Subhani. He said people of the state are excelling in the field of IT and the C-DAC Patna centre with its new courses would provide the students grand opportunities here. Aditya Kumar Sinha, director of C-DAC Patna, said with high-end core research, they are initiating education and training programmes in emerging technologies through different courses. Certificates were distributed among the students for BRIDGE-DAC programme sponsored by the department of minority welfare and the department of IT for SC, ST and OBC students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/c-dac-launches-technical-courses-for-students/articleshow/86405963.cms||---

This is being done in tune with the ‘local goes global’ mission of PM Narendra Modi, and the steps being taken in this regard also have the active support of CM Nitish Kumar, he said at an exhibition (Vanijya Utsav) of the Bihar-based products having huge export potential, like silk fabrics, makhana-based products and Madhubani paintings being exported. The exhibition was organized by the Union commerce ministry under the guidance of its additional secretary Amrit Lal Meena on the Adhiveshan Bhavan premises. Among the participants were entrepreneurs, representatives of business and industrial organisations, exporters and importers, manufacturers and traders. Hussain said Bihar will also contribute to the Centre’s ‘Make in India for the world export’ project that has put the export target of US$400 billion. Some products from the state were being already exported, but the present aim of the state government is to increase the volume of export by accessing the market potential in 75 countries. Highlighting the emerging industrial scenario in the state, Hussain said the industries department has cleared proposals worth Rs35,019 crore, while the companies interested in ethanol production have proposed to produce 187 crore litres of it for supply. A decision was taken on the occasion to open and establish the regional centre of Indian Silk Export Council in the state. Efforts were being made to also have the regional office of the Directorate of Foreign Trade in the state in active consultation with the Centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/govts-blueprint-ready-to-create-export-hub-in-every-district-bihar-minister/articleshow/86405876.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Business||Did cos panic, make wrong moves amid Covid crisis?||By Raj BowenOver the past 12-18 months, as the Covid tsunami started rolling, the corporate world has displayed the classical ‘reptilian responses’ of fight, flight, and freeze. As business numbers started crashing, the first losers in the game were the ones who shed any semblance of culture and values, with immediate slashing of salaries and letting go the ‘least cost’ employees. The message in these firms was clear: “Do whatever it takes, recover the money outstanding from clients and close all pending business deals at whatever discount it takes”. These poor souls just killed their organisations’ future in one shot — a classic mix of fight (anger) and fright (fear & frustration). Employees waited to be repaid what was lost, once things started getting better. But when they realised this was not going to happen, the better (and now bitter) ones left. These organisations will struggle always to hire and grow talent, and many may not even survive. The second category almost took a call to ‘suspend business’, to wait and see what would happen. They let go of office spaces and stopped incurring virtually any cost they could think of — ‘invest’ became a dirty word in these organisations. These were the ones who ‘froze’ and, as things turned the corner, they are trying to pick up where they left off from. And to their dismay, they are realising that, while they hibernated, the world has moved on, including their best talent, their best (often the newer) employees, their best clients, and their competition. They may as well erase the slate and restart a new organisation from scratch. They can, at best, be pitied. But the message of hope and display of class and pedigree is being shown by many organisations, across sectors and in new, emerging businesses. These are the ones who will now take over from the ‘mediocrity-dominated’ past. And these are the organisations of the future and show some common characteristics: * Boosting loyalty: Right since the pandemic started, they gave clear instructions that no employee will be asked to leave and no one’s salary would be adversely affected. In fact, those who were fiscally strong, went ahead with compensation hikes, understanding that employee ‘family incomes’ may be dipping in many cases and a small support could mean a lot. These organisations, by default, strengthened their bonds of trust and loyalty. * Increased contact: The top team members increased their personal contact time with the junior-most levels — communicating constant messages of assurance and hope. (This is not the same as sitting through inane weekly review meetings, to see the business projections.) This had a dual benefit: The top leaders empathised with realities at the bottom, and the employees felt genuinely valued. What a payoff this was, a low-cost and high-value. * Sharing info: The leaders in these firms pulled together all team members and encouraged the sharing of ideas from everyone on what the organisation needs to do differently, to not only weather the storm but also come out winning. Again, this is not the same as the town halls or mini town halls called by the big bosses where the senior folks exercise their vocal cords while the rest wait for the meeting to end. * New structures: These organisations rapidly reorganised teams. This created a very vibrant cross-flow of teamwork. These organisations are being able to do far more together, without bothering for silo credits. This is ‘walking the talk’ about every employee being a bundle of talent, only if the structure supports the leverage and help these capabilities to grow. Unfortunately, most conventional structures are designed to stifle talent and feed the ego trips of senior managers. Again, this is not the same as organisations quickly promoting high-maintenance employees with fancy designation add-ons to further feed their egos, under the garb of growth. * Giving freedom: While reemphasising results accountability, these organisations gave awesome space and discretion to employees around how they felt best placed to do their work. Even in periods of pressure, this empowerment was not pulled back. In contrast, the losing organisations had the senior managers calling meeting after meeting, with the CEO even getting into micro details at each meeting — more control, more mistrust, more disengagement. * Learning anew: These organisations insisted that every employee self-learn something new during this period. It’s amazing what a high percentage of employees in such workplaces have upgraded their future-readiness with courses from across the globe — a real boon of online access. (Of course, many learnt art, music, cooking, etc, which surely helped to uplift the family time quality, this always pays off with uplifted worktime quality.) These organisations chose renewal over fight, fright, or freeze. They chose to respond rather than react. The mirror of these realities is a good indicator of which organisations are poised to ride the waves of the new normal while the others, at best, watch from the sidelines, if they are there. A hard look inside your organisation may be very useful — it may still not be too late.

Those arrested were identified as Dashrath Manjhi (28), Yadunath Rai (25) and Dashrath’s relative Salwa Devi (35) of Karnauti and Wakil Paswan (27) and Gautam Sahni (22) of village Bande under Patori police station area in Samastipur. They were sent to jail on Tuesday. The victim’s mother had lodged a kidnapping case against unknown persons on September 14. The girl had left home on a bicycle at around 4am to attend her coaching class at Patori in Samastipur district, bordering Mahnar. Vaishali SP Maneesh told this newspaper over phone that the girl’s cycle and her school bag were recovered on the confession of the arrested persons. Maneesh said Dashrath intended to rape the girl and roped in his four associates. He said the medical board, in its postmortem report, denied rape. “Dashrath and three others intercepted the girl outside the village between 4am and 4.30am on September 14. Her body was recovered the next morning,” the SP said. Maneesh said Dashrath and others strangled the girl with bare hands when she started screaming. He said Dashrath had told his associates that he wanted to kill the girl.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/5-held-in-vaishali-girl-murder-case/articleshow/86407300.cms||Debashish Karmakar

Kumar said railways has started admitting boys and girls at the Supervisor Training Centre at Samastipur, Basic Training Centre at Harnaut and Gaya Railway Colony at Mughalsarai. Admission is being given to trainees on the basis of marks obtained in matric examinations. Trains diverted: Railways has diverted at least seven special passenger trains from Wednesday onwards due to non-interlocking (NI) work to be carried out at Rampur Junction on Moradabad-Shahjahanpur section of the Norther Railway. “While Howrah-Kathgodam special passenger (03019/03020) will run via Lalkuan-Bareilly route, Dibrugarh-Lalgarh special passenger (05909) will be diverted to Shahjahanpur–Bareilly-Chandausi–Moradabad route on Wednesday,” the CPRO said.

---||Mangaluru||Forum expresses concern over school dropouts in DK||Mangaluru: Dakshina Kannada Federation of Education Resource Centres has expressed concern over the increasing number of school dropouts in the district. A recent survey conducted by the panchayats and MCC has revealed that the district has about 567 dropouts between the ages of 7 to 18 in 2020-21. The department of public instruction has so far managed to bring back around 157 children to continue their education. Efforts are on to bring the rest back. The federation members met Dakshina Kannada deputy commissioner K V Rajendra recently, and submitted a memorandum. Vatsala Naik, secretary of the federation, said that the survey outcome is shocking. “The issue needs to be addressed under the provisions of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009. Under section 9 of the RTE Act, it is the responsibility of the local bodies—be it the gram panchayat in rural areas, and municipal bodies in towns or cities, to ensure that all children compulsorily attend school. They should also maintain records of all school children, by conducting a survey. The district administration should direct local bodies in this regard,” they said. Denis D’Souza, coordinator at PADI, and part of the federation, pointed out that there is a tendency of students turning into child labourers after dropping out from school. “We suspect that many of them have become child labourers after dropping out of school, and the number of dropouts have increased. Therefore, we have also requested the labour department to look into the issue and conduct a survey across the district, to find out the reason why this is happening.” Denis said closure of schools for a very long time and financial crisis among families due to the Covid-19 pandemic, may have forced children to discontinue their education and support their families.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/forum-expresses-concern-over-school-dropouts-in-dk/articleshow/86407004.cms||---

Bhujbal on Monday conducted a meeting of senior officials of the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) and instructed them to immediately take up road repair work from Gonde to Vadpe, and further to Mulund. Senior officials of Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority, NHAI officials from Nashik and Thane districts, superintending engineer of Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation and Thane traffic police were present at the meeting held in Mantralaya. Bhujbal told the officials that if the roads coming under the toll plazas are not repaired by the given deadline, action will be taken against the toll companies. “The Mumbai-Agra highway is in a bad shape due to the heavy rainfall. There are also issues of traffic congestion on the highway between Vadpe to Gonde and Vadpe to Mulund,” he said. Bhujbal said considering the traffic congestion at the Mulund Toll Naka, the officials responsible for the upkeep of the road should visit the spot and personally look into the problems and give impetus to the necessary work. Meanwhile, officials from the company that operates the toll at Ghoti said that the road repair work in the ghat section of the Mumbai-Agra highway near Igatpuri and Kasara has begun. Four teams have been deployed on 18-km stretch to ensure that all the potholes are filled. They will continue to work till the rainy season endsS and permanent asphalting will be done thereafter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/road-repairs-on-mumbai-agra-highway-begin-oct-15-deadline-set/articleshow/86403571.cms||Santosh Sonawane

The opposition block is yet to declare its candidate for the council byelection, to be held on October 4, in case more than one candidate remains in the contest. Contacted over phone, Nazish told TOI that she would file her nomination papers around 11am on September 22 (Wednesday), which is the last day for doing so. Scrutiny of nomination papers will be held on September 23, while September 27 is the last date for withdrawal of candidature. “Nazish would file her papers as the JD(U) candidate but she would be the nominee of all the constituents of the NDA. Important leaders of all four NDA constituents, including CM Nitish Kumar, will be present during her filing of nomination papers,” Kushwaha told TOI. The byelection was necessitated following the untimely death of JD(U) MLC Tanweer. Serving as the in-charge of JD(U) minority cell, Tanweer died of Covid-19 on May 8 this year. A native of Gaya town, Tanweer was elected as the JNU Students’ Union president in 1991 as the nominee of NSUI, the student wing of Congress. He also served as state president of Youth Congress in Bihar. Tanweer was first elected to the Bihar Legislative Council as the Congress nominee in July, 2016. Later, he along with other three Congress MLCs, led by former BPCC chief Ashok Choudhary, split the Congress legislative party in the council. A few days later, all four joined the ruling JD(U) in March, 2018. Tanweer’s term as MLC was to complete on July 21, 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/jdu-fields-rozina-in-bypoll-for-council-seat/articleshow/86407052.cms||Madan Kumar

With the residents getting some respite from this year’s incessant rainfall and water finally receding from the paddy fields, the farmers need to use urea, but it has almost vanished from the market. Kaushal Kumar Jha, who hails from Mahrail village under Andhratharhi block of Jhanjharpur subdivision, told this reporter on Tuesday that urea was being clandestinely supplied to Nepal. Another farmer, Ramdev Yadav of Birsair village, alleged, “Farmers have to pay Rs 350 to Rs 400 for a bag of urea while the price fixed by the government is only Rs 262.” Recently, the district administration had reportedly raided some places in the border areas and initiated proceedings against the erring businessmen. This reporter tried to contact the district agriculture officer, but his cellphone was switched off.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/urea-shortage-hits-farmers/articleshow/86407176.cms||---

He said six more ropeways would be installed at different places in the state to promote tourism. “Earlier, the ropeway facility was available only at Rajgir. Today, I got an opportunity to inaugurate a new ropeway at Mandar Hills. We have decided to start ropeway facility at six other locations. All the proposed ropeways will be commissioned one-by-one to provide more facilities to the tourists visiting the state,” Nitish said. “Three of the proposed six ropeways would be installed at Rohtasgarh Fort, Mundeshwari Hills in Kaimur and Vanabar Hills in Jehanabad district. The other three would be installed at Dungeshwari Hills, Brahmyoni and Pretshila (the last two are religious places for Hindus) situated in and around Gaya town,” state tourism minister Narayan Prasad, who accompanied the CM, told TOI over the phone. The CM also travelled through the ropeway and went to the top of the Mandar Hills. He also prayed in the Jain Mandir located there for peace and prosperity for the people of Bihar. Accompanied by Deputy CM Tarkishore Prasad and some other ministers, the CM also inspected Sita Kund, located on the hills. He also inquired about the natives and the villages settled around the Mandal Hills. “I went to the top of the Mandar Hills for the first time today. Scenic beauty from the top of the hills was very attractive. Earlier, people had to spend nearly an hour to reach the hilltop. Now through the ropeway, they can reach there within a few minutes. The ropeway will provide more convenience to the tourists,” Nitish said. The CM further said the Paapharni pond and other tourist spots around Mandar Hills would also be developed and beautified. He said the places of archaeological importance of Banka district would also be developed. Water resources minister Sanjay Jha and rural works minister Jayant Raj accompanied the CM. They also enjoyed boat ride in the Orhni dam reservoir in Banka district and inspected its different areas through motorboat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nitish-inaugurates-ropeway-at-mandar-hills/articleshow/86406947.cms||Madan Kumar
---||Patna||Panchayat representatives in Bihar feel cheated, says Congress||PATNA: State Congress president Madan Mohan Jha said here on Tuesday that the party would distribute the copies of the document—“Journey of 16 years: From decentralisation to destruction”—prepared by its research wing on the panchayati raj system in villages across the state. Unveiling the document at Sadaquat Ashram, the state Congress chief said the very concept of “Swarajya” still remains unfulfilled. As a result, the representatives of the panchayati raj institutions are feeling cheated and dejected. Taking a swipe at the ruling NDA both in the state and at the Centre, the BPCC chief said the incumbent government had been working on the centralisation of power instead of decentralisation. “The objective of late Mahatma Gandhi and former PM late Rajiv Gandhi behind the panchayati raj system to empower villages has still remained unfulfilled,” he added. Speaking on the occasion, former union minister and Rajya Sabha MP Akhilesh Prasad Singh exhorted the workers of the party to match towards villages to take part in the upcoming election to the panchayati raj institutions in the state. He alleged that in most of the cases, the decisions taken by the powers that be either in Delhi or in Patna were thrust upon the representatives of the panchayati raj institutions. “The decision that affects that particular section or class should be taken by itself. But the present situation is vice versa,” he rued. Earlier welcoming the guests on the occasion, chairman of the research wing of the party Madhav Anand said that he has tried to show in the document as to how institutions have been ruined in the name of decentralisation of power during the 16 years rule in the state. Elaborating it further, Madhav said that the concept of ‘sushasan’ without ‘swashasan’ was a misnomer. He also raised questions over the use of EVMs in the panchayat polls in the state to elect representatives on four posts only. He also expressed doubts over the use of VVPAT at the polling booths in the panchayat polls. Speaking on the occasion, Congress MLC Prem Chandra Mishra expressed his concern over weakening of the panchayati raj system in the state. Though the Bihar Panchayati Raj (Amendment) Act 1992 empowers panchayats to devise policies for social and economic development, the same has never been delegated to them, he alleged. Former legislator Rishi Mishra, former MLC Lal Babu Lal, Nagendra Kumar Vikal and Prof. Shashi Kumar Singh were prominent among others present on the occasion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/panchayat-representatives-in-state-feel-cheated-says-cong/articleshow/86407550.cms||Ramashankar
---||Patna||FSSAI report: Bihar ranks lowest in ensuring food safety||PATNA: Bihar ranked the lowest among the large states in ensuring food safety in 2020-21, according to Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) report released by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on Monday. The overall score of the state was 35 whereas Gujarat topped with 75 points. The third edition of the State Food Safety Index ranked the states on five parameters of food safety, which included human resources and institutional data (20% weightage), compliance (30%), food testing facility (20%), training and capacity building (10%) and consumer empowerment (20%). The ranking is an effort of the Union government to galvanize the states to work towards ensuring safe food for citizens. The state has secured only 5 points each in human resources and institutional data and food testing facility, 2 in training and capacity building, 11 in compliance and 12 in consumer empowerment. The separate teams of experts for food testing and food & nutrition professionals, in addition to FSSAI officials, conducted the assessment and evaluation in each category. The teams examined the details received and also interacted with the states/UTs through web meetings. Mukesh Kashyap, the food safety inspector of Bihar, told this newspaper on Tuesday that there was an acute shortage of manpower in the state food safety unit. “There are only 14 food safety officers (FSO) in the state and some of them have to look after the maximum up to four districts at a time. Minimum two districts have been allotted to each of them for inspection to ensure the quality of food. Due to shortage of manpower, the overall marking was poor in food safety index,” he said. “The shortage of manpower, however, will be resolved soon as we have already taken approval for 105 posts of FSOs from the state government and all the vacant posts will be filled within 3-4 months. Once this problem is resolved, we would work towards ensuring healthy foods to our residents through our daily inspections. As there is no separate state food safety commissioner, we also lag on several parameters. There is no full-fledged designated officer in food safety unit,” Kashyap said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/fssai-report-bihar-ranks-lowest-in-ensuring-food-safety/articleshow/86405757.cms||Faryal Rumi

Action will be taken against all these 14 pharmacy shops, subject to replies. FDA assistant commissioner Pushpadas Ballal told TOI, “The state government directed to undertake the drive. Accordingly, our teams inspected 187 pharmacy shops between September 14 and 20. Registered pharmacists were found in 173 pharmacy shops. 14 shops had no registered pharmacists present during the visit. Our teams ensured closure of these 14 shops immediately. Showcause notice was also issued to these shops. They were given permission to resume operation after compliance of guidelines. We will initiate appropriate action against these pharmacy shops after receiving replies and investigation.” There are around 4,000 pharmacy shops in the district. FDA reportedly could not cover all of them due to lack of staff. Majority of the inspected shops were from Ramdaspeth, which is known as the medical hub of the district. Ballal said it is also mandatory for registered pharmacists to check each and every medicine before handing it over to the customer. “We conduct such special drives twice a year. We also check randomly to ensure presence of registered pharmacists at pharmacy shops throughout the year,” he said. Owners of a couple of pharmacy shops said such drives plays a very important role in the field of pharmacy. “This will ensure sale of appropriate medicines to the patient. Also, registered pharmacists are aware of chemical content and help the patient in getting medicines, in case they don’t have the ones prescribed by the doctor. They also check if any medical shops have opened without licence and registered pharmacist,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/fda-finds-7-pharmacy-shops-running-without-registered-pharmacists/articleshow/86410095.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

The festival will begin from October 7 with ‘kalash sthapna’. It will conclude on October 15 with ‘Ravan vadh’ ritual. The district administration has issued Covid-19 guidelines to be followed by the organisers during the pandemic. Patna DM Chandrashekhar Singh said the puja committees have been asked to avoid large gatherings in the pandals and follow Covid-19 protocols such as use of face masks and hand sanitisers. “Important events like Ramleela, Ravan vadh and Bharat milap, would be held this year on October 14, 15 and 16 respectively with precautions at Kalidas Rangalaya,” he said. “The SDOs and SDPOs will give permission to the organisers and committees to set up the pandals,” he added. Kamal Nopany, chairperson of Dussehra Committee Trust, Patna, told this newspaper on Tuesday that the effigies of Ravan, Kumbhkaran, Meghnad and Coronavirus will be made this year for Vijayadashmi. “We have decided to make small effigies as the celebration will be held at Kalidas Rangalaya instead of Gandhi Maidan. The Ravan effigy will be 15 feet high while that of Kumbhkaran will be 13 feet, Meghnad 11 feet and Coronavirus 10 feet high. Only 100 persons will be allowed to see Ravan vadh, but arrangements for its live broadcast will also be made,” he said. “On October 14, Ramleela will be played. All the artists will be from Bihar. Bharat milap act will be held on October 16 and only 400 people with passes or cards will be allowed. The preparations for the three events have already started,” Nopany said.

Officals said the leopard had killed two goats and two stray dogs in the past week. The leopard was wandering in Payanapalli and Panchaliyur villages in the Hosur forest range. Villagers first spotted the leopard with its two cubs on September 13, C Mahendran, forest ranger, said. Immediately, villagers informed the forest department. Officials tried to trace the leopard manually. Since their efforts proved futile, they set up automatic cameras in 10 main spots across the two villages. “The cameras will take snaps once the animal crosses them,” he said. The officials have also set up a trap in each village with a stray dog as a bait. Dharmapuri district conservator of forest A Periyasamy, Hosur forest range wildlife conservator K Karthikeyani, and forest veterinary assistant surgeon Dr. A Prakash were camping in the villages.

For the past one year, farmers inPunjab and Haryana have been picketing toll plazas on both state and national highways, and are not allowing concessionaires to collect toll tax from vehicles. Talking to TOI, BKU (Ambawata) district president Raj Kumar Tomar, said that this was just a “trailer” for two hours. If the government does not withdraw the new farm laws, they would make the plazas free of toll indefinitely from September 29. “People will have a free pass on Yamuna Expressway, like they have on toll roads in Punjab and Haryana, if the government does not take our demands seriously,” he said. When contacted, Maant toll plaza manager R B Singh said that they are trying to resolve the issue. “We have informed the higher authorities in this regard and will follow their directions,” he said, adding that this is “a law and order issue” and they “cannot do much”. According to reports, about 50 toll plazas in Punjab and Haryana have been rendered non-functional following farmers’ protests, resulting in an estimated daily loss of Rs 5 crore. For the past 8 months, toll plazas on Delhi-Chandigarh National Highway 44 have been converted into protest sites by farmers. In March this year, road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari said in a written reply to the Rajya Sabha that the National Highways Authority of India suffered a toll revenue loss of Rs 814.4 crore till March 16 on account of farmers' protests in three states. “Loss of revenue due to farmers’ protest has primarily occurred in the states of Punjab and Haryana as loss of Rs 487 and Rs 326 crore was recorded in the states respectively. However, Rs 1.4 crore loss was recorded at a few plazas in Rajasthan,” the minister had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/up-farmers-go-punjab-haryana-way-make-yamuna-expressway-toll-plaza-free-for-public-at-mathura/articleshow/86405703.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

During routine checking of a milk collection centre, the FDA officials had found adulterants like spray-dried whey powder, refined soyabean oil, unknown colourless liquid, whey powder solution etc. During the course of the investigation, the owner of the milk collection centre could now give a satisfactory explanation about why he had the adulterants to the officials. Subsequently, he named the two people who had provided him with the adulterants and the person who purchased the adulterated milk from him. Chandrashekhar Salunke, the joint director of FDA-Nashik, said the food security officers have been conducting the raids as per his instructions. Now that one case of adulteration has been unearthed, it could be possible that similar illegal activities are carried out in other collection centres as well. Against this backdrop, all food safety officers across the division — comprising Nashik, Dhule, Jalgaon, Ahmednagar and Nandurbar districts — have been instructed to be more vigilant and take action against those adulterating milk. Salunke said there are standing instructions to the food safety officers to check for adulteration in food products. The officers have also been instructed to make sure that the food products are prepared and stored in hygienic conditions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/milk-collection-centres-under-fda-scanner/articleshow/86403620.cms||Santosh Sonawane

On Tuesday, a fully-grown Neem tree was found being illegally cut for reportedly better visibility of a newly-opened shop. Due to timely intervention from members of NGO Green Vigil Foundation, corporator Sunil Hiranwar and officials of garden department of the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), the tree could be saved from getting fully chopped. After getting a tip-off from an alert citizen, Green Vigil members rushed in front of Premium Plaza in Dharampeth, where they found professional tree-cutters on top of the tree, in the process of chopping it. “They had already cut 14 branches of the 50-year-old Neem tree. When we tried to stop the felling, the tree-cutters fled the spot,” said Kaustav Chatterjee, founder of the NGO. On enquiry, the activists and NMC officials found that the tree was cut on orders of one Abhijeet Ingale who has recently opened a shop in the area. According to sources, NMC has taken his statement after carrying out the panchnama. “Though the shopkeeper maintained that the branches were being trimmed as they were coming in contact with an overhead cable, the ground reality did not seem so. If that was the case, he should have taken permission and cut only a small part which was touching the wire,” said sources from the spot, adding that the tree was being cut for better visibility of the shop. As per the given permission, NMC’s garden department will issue a notice and initiate necessary action. “Strict action should be taken in cases like these. There is enough awareness to know that cutting trees without permission is illegal. Shopkeepers can’t damage environment for their business growth,” added Chatterjee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/neem-tree-trimmed-for-better-visibility-of-shop/articleshow/86410123.cms||Manka Behl

The police identified the accused as Riyas, 24, and Rahul, 24. Both of them hail from Pachalloor in the district. The police said the catch was made during a vehicle inspection at Perunguzhi during the early hours of Tuesday. The police intercepted their two-wheeler on suspicion, and upon checking they found that the two accused were carrying 11.550 kilogram of ganja. The accused told the police that they were transporting the consignment to be handed over to peddlers in the Chirayinkeezhu region. The police have launched a probe to find out the individuals who were supposed to receive the contraband from the accused. They have also confiscated the two-wheeler on which the accused were travelling. The police said the ganja seized from the accused was worth around Rs 5 lakh. They procured the ganja at a cheap rate of Rs 5,000 per kilogram from Andhra Pradesh and sold it at a rate of Rs 40,000 per kilogram. Riyas and Rahul are habitual offenders who have been arrested for similar charges in the past. They are also involved in other criminal cases such as assaults and causing hurt. They were produced before the court and remanded in judicial custody. Youths wanted in chain snatching cases held: The Vilappilsala police have arrested two youths who are allegedly behind the back-to-back chain snatching cases reported under Aryanad and Vilappilsala police station limits on September 15. Police identified the accused as Arjun of Malayinkeezhu and Ajesh Lal, 22, of Maranalloor. Their arrests were recorded on Monday. Vilappilsala police said that the duo was arrested for snatching chain weighing one sovereign from Sujana (22) of Thinavila, at Mulayara near Vilappilsala. They were tracked down and arrested following an investigation based on examining surveillance camera visuals. Following the arrest, the youths admitted that they were behind snatching of 1.5 sovereign gold chain from Shailaja (42), an ASHA worker, at Meppattumala near Vellarada on the same day. They said that they first made a failed attempt of snatching chain at Neyyar on September 15 before committing the crimes at Meppattumala and Mulayara, respectively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/police-seize-12-kg-ganja-during-vehicle-checking/articleshow/86407940.cms||---
---||Nashik||2 held for killing monitor lizard||KOLHAPUR: Two snake catchers have been arrested by the Sangli forest department for allegedly killing and consuming the meat of an Indian monitor lizard. Dadaso Tukaram Pol and his son Harshal Dadaso Pol have been granted one-day forest custody by first class magistrate Kadegaon. Vijay Mane, deputy conservator of forests, Sangli, said, “A resident of Kadepur called Dadaso Pol to rescue the wild animal found in his house. As per law, the rescuers must communicate with forest officials before releasing the animal into its natural habitat. Instead of telling us, the snake catchers took the wild lizard to their house, killed it and probably ate it. We have booked both men under the Wildlife Protection Act and such crimes invite strict punishment.” The forest department has launched a helpline number — 1926 — for the common people to inform them on spotting any wild animal. The foresters have appealed to people to use the helpline number and avoid killing wild animals. The forest officials stated that the animal’s remains found at Pol’s farm were sent to a Hyderabad-based lab for testing. The test helped confirmed that they were that of the Indian monitor lizard. Earlier this year, in June, the Sangli forest department had registered a case against a so-called animal activist for illegally caging 37 wild birds as well as animals. The forest department had received a tip that several birds and animals had been kept in cages at the rescuer’s home after which officials had raided the premises. In total, 25 kites, an owl, a heron, an eagle, two storks, two monkeys and four tortoises were found on the premises.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/2-held-for-killing-monitor-lizard/articleshow/86403692.cms||---

He said Sunil and Kalanand belonged to Majhwara in ward number 13, Dhananjay to Chauri in ward number 3, Sunil to Gerari Mundmala and Naveen to Chikni, all in Araria district. He said Dhananjay was the car owner. The SHO said they were returning from a fair organised at Gerari Mundmala village on Anant Chaturdashi when the accident took place at around 4am. “It seems the car was at a high speed and the driver lost control of the steering wheels,” he said. He said there was no visible injury marks on their bodies. “It seems they were unable to escape out of the car and got drowned in the water. The car had turned turtle,” he said. The SHO said a few villagers spotted the four wheels of the car in the water at around 5am and informed the police. The bodies were taken out of the car. A crane was used to pull the car out of the water,” he said. Kumar said the bodies were handed over to their respective family members after postmortem. “The DM and Sadar SDPO also visited the hospital.

The health workers had stopped the vaccination drive across the rural area of the district to protest against the attack. Rajendra Bairagi, president of state zilla parishad health services employees union, said, “Our purpose of suspending the vaccination drive was achieved after the people, who attacked the medical officer, were booked by police. Serving the people is our top priority and as soon as the offence was registered on Monday evening we decided to resume the vaccination process.” The accused, who are residents of Paste village, had attacked the medical officer during the vaccination drive on September 17. The duo had assaulted the officer after the latter denied administering the vaccine to the former. They had not registered for getting vaccinated, nor did they collect the token at the vaccination centre for getting the jab. Still, they were forcing the medical officer to administer the vaccination. The incident led to suspension of the vaccination drive on Monday. Bairagi said their main demand was getting a police complaint registered against the suspects so that such incidents are not repeated in the district. “After the complaint was registered, the vaccination process resumed. Other than Sinnar rural hospital, vaccination process had stopped across the rural district. Around 1 lakh people are vaccinated in the rural areas every day,” said Bairagi. Meanwhile, police inspector Santosh Mutkule of Sinnar police station said a search has been launched to trace the two suspects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/vaccination-resumes-in-govt-facilities-across-rural-nashik/articleshow/86403652.cms||Santosh Sonawane

---||Nagpur||Wildlife crime cell begins in city, to provide real-time case data||Nagpur: In a first, wildlife wing of the state forest department opened wildlife crime cell at Van Bhavan in Civil Lines this week. The cell will provide real-time data to officials on past and present cases in the entire state. “With centralized data in place, the cell will be able to look into backward and forward linkages and monitor all cases. Now, officials will be able to get all details about the accused, conviction, legal status etc. Our first step will be data compilation,” said Sunil Limaye, principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF), Wildlife, Maharashtra. “At present, though officials register preliminary offences (PORs), but we don’t know whether these cases are being taken to the logical end. The crime cell will compile all such data and a deputy conservator or DFO rank officer with some staff from Maharashtra Zoo Authority will look after the cell,” Limaye told TOI. At present, Kerala is the only state where such a cell is in operation since 2017, with the support of NGO Wildlife Trust of India (WTI). It is assisted by a team headed by Jose Louies, chief, wildlife crime control division of WTI. Though Melghat Tiger Reserve (MTR) in Amravati too has a crime cell, it operates as a cyber cell on the lines of the police department by providing leads on wildlife criminals. Limaye said, “We are preparing an excel sheet format which will have comprehensive details about a crime like spot, GPS location, POR number, sections imposed, reason for death, conviction, acquittal etc. The data will have to be filled by officials at the range level. A meeting will be held every month to review the cases and division officials will be asked to explain reasons for deviation, if any.” Sources said the wildlife wing is also in the process of procuring a software — HAWK (Hostile Activity Watch Kernel) — for centralized information management system. The WTI is customizing this software for Maharashtra. Even if the forest department may be doing it now, there is no preventive intelligence. All information is scattered and a new incumbent joining the area doesn’t know about history of the crime. “The wildlife crime cell will also give an overview of all cases and help assess the performance of the officials. Our second step would be digitization of all cases. It will remove procedural mistakes in the documentation. For example, if an RFO is registering a POR in Thane, those manning the cell here will come to know about it immediately. The division-level officials will have access to the system,” said Limaye.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/wildlife-crime-cell-begins-in-city-to-provide-real-time-case-data/articleshow/86410189.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

Their five-year-old daughter, the sole witness to the murder in the early hours, was thrashed when she tried to save her parents.

The family is tight lipped about the matter. Police sources said Sameer had slept in their house on the night of the murder but was not there in the morning.

---||Mumbai||‘Backstabber’ Sharad Pawar can’t be guru, MVA deal for power: Shiv Sena’s Anant Geete||MUMBAI: In a major embarrassment to Shiv Sena, former Union minister from the party Anant Geete called the Sena-NCP-Congress MVA government an adjustment for power and said Sharad Pawar, who had “backstabbed” Congress to form his own NCP, can’t be a ‘guru’ for Shiv Sainiks. Pawar is considered a key architect of the MVA government, which ensured BJP was kept out of power in the state in 2019. In fact, many now consider him as acting as a remote control of the government. Sena was quick to distance itself from Geete’s comments. Spokesperson Sanjay Raut’s measured response was that it could be someone’s personal opinion, it wasn’t the view of the party. Speaking at a Sena event in his hometown of Raigad on Monday, Geete said: “Sharad Pawar cannot ever be our leader as this government (MVA) is a mere adjustment. Let people use as many accolades for Pawar but our ‘guru’ is only Balasaheb Thackeray. As long as this government is functioning, it will go on...when this alliance breaks, our home is Shiv Sena and we can’t go to their homes.” He added: “Pawar formed his party NCP by backstabbing Congress. If Congress and NCP can’t come together and become one, Shiv Sena also can’t always toe the Congress’s policy. Relations between Congress and NCP were not too cordial either. If they can’t come together, how can the Sena accept their ideology? The CM is from Shiv Sena but this is an MVA government. We have to think only about Shiv Sena.” Geete, a six-time MP, had lost Raigad to NCP’s Sunil Tatkare in the 2019 general elections. Tatkare’s daughter Aditi is a minister in the MVA government and the guardian minister for Raigad. Political observers said Geete was losing ground to the Tatkares in Raigad, and his vitriol was an attempt to regain lost ground ahead of the local body polls. Geete, who had been the Union minister for heavy industries, said he didn’t harbour any ill-intention for the MVA government. “In fact, I want it to succeed,” he said. Responding to Geete’s comments, Raut said: “I don’t know what Anant Geete has said. It may be someone’s personal opinion but it is not the statement of the party. There is a three-party government in Maharashtra. Sharad Pawar is a leader of the country. Sharad Pawar, Uddhav Thackeray and Congress have formed this government together. This government is going to last for five years.” Sunil Tatkare passed off Geete’s statement as an expression of frustration. “Geete is old. He was defeated. Geete’s statement on Pawar was out of frustration and is like trying to spit on the sun. Geete is buried under the burden of BJP. When such statements were made about the leader of his own party, his self-esteem had plummeted. In fact, in recent times, Geete’s political condition has become unbearable and unspeakable,” he said. Geete’s comments come soon after Pawar described Congress as “old zamindars”. Taking a jibe at Congress, Pawar had said zamindars used to have huge lands but the land parcels have shrunk. Their ‘havelis’ remain, but they aren’t capable of maintaining or repairing them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/backstabber-pawar-cant-be-guru-mva-deal-for-power-in-mumbai-senas-geete/articleshow/86412202.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Nagpur||HC discharges ex-Gadkari aide from irri scam case||Nagpur: The Nagpur bench of Bombay high court discharged Sanjay Kholapurkar, a former officer on special duty (OSD) with Union minister Nitin Gadkari, from offences related to the multi-crore irrigation scam. He had resigned from the OSD’s post after his name surfaced in the scam, particularly for alleged irregularities into Gosikhurd right canal (Ghodazari branch canal) construction. Prior to joining Gadkari, he was working as a superintending engineer (SE) at the Gosikhurd project. The petitioner was named as an accused in a scam-related case under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, after an FIR was lodged at Sadar police station by Maharashtra anti-corruption bureau (ACB). He filed an application with the special court hearing scam cases for discharge, but it was rejected. Kholapurkar challenged it in HC through counsel Shyam Dewani, contending that though he faced departmental inquiry and was held guilty of commission of offence of administrative and procedural lapses, the enquiry report exonerated him of criminal culpability. Kholapurkar’s application was strongly opposed by public prosecutor Kalyani Deshpande, who argued that as an SE, he was obligated to follow every rule and procedure, but failed to discharge it. She pointed out that the updation of work value at the Gosikhurd project was unwarranted and beyond his administrative power. She contended that even the Vidarbha Irrigation Development Corporation (VIDC) committee was empowered to update the work value only up to 5%, but the updation recommended and approved was 8.6%, with the result that the enhancement of the estimated tender value was Rs3.33 crore. Justice Rohit Deo, however, stated that if the material on record is scrutinized, it is insufficient to presume the commission of an offence. “The administrative or procedural lapses would not be sufficient even to raise strong suspicion of commission of offence in the absence of any material in the final report to prima facie suggest that the accused acted with dishonest or fraudulent intent, and he obtained any valuable thing or pecuniary advantage for himself or any other person, or misappropriated or converted any property entrusted to him or under his control,” Deo said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-discharges-ex-gadkari-aide-from-irri-scam-case/articleshow/86410218.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Nashik||M’wada crop damage: Less than 30% asessment done||Aurangabad: Crops grown on more than 14.7 lakh hectare in different parts of the Marathwada region have suffered damage following heavy rainfall in September, revealed the preliminary estimates. However, the government machinery has completed panchanamas of about 4.2 lakh hectare so far. As per the official data, roughly 20.2 lakh farmers in the region are estimated to have suffered due to the spells of heavy to very heavy rainfall that had submerged fields and damaged the standing kharif crops. With panchanamas being done of less than 30% of the affected area so far, lakhs of affected farmers are still waiting anxiously for the necessary formalities to get over in order to avail the compensation. While in Osmanabad and Hingoli districts, 100% of the panchanama work has been completed, the remaining six districts are lagging behind. Parbhani district has registered the lowest assessment of crop damage with just 14%. Latur has completed 45% of the work, followed by Aurangabad (38%), Jalna (30%), Beed (29%) and Nanded (27%). Aurangabad divisional commissioner Sunil Kendrekar could not be reached for his comments on the progress of crop-damage assessment in the region. Another senior divisional official said the districts with relatively lower crop damage have completed the panchanamas. “All district administrations have been told to expedite the necessary formalities and submit the final report on crop damage,” he said. Besides the damage to the crops, preliminary assessment of rain damage carried out by the revenue department has identified high-grade erosion of agricultural soil in more than 617 hectare in Aurangabad, Jalna and Latur districts. Expressing concerns over the slow pace of panchanamas, CPI functionary Rajan Kshirsagar said the government should make a separate record of flood-hit areas while assessing the rain damage. “Parts of Marathwada witnessed floods recently and should get more official help as per the standing norms,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/mwada-crop-damage-less-than-30-asessment-done/articleshow/86403734.cms||---

Their brothers, Rakesh and Rajesh, had been arrested for murdering a woman, 30, and her daughter, 8, during a robbery. Nine days later, the woman’s relatives surrounded their house. They wanted revenge. They set the house ablaze, the mother Rajo Devi, who survived, later said. Her daughters Gita, 22, and Monu, 20, died. On Monday, 11 years on, a special SC/ST court found the seven accused, including three women, guilty and sentenced them to life imprisonment for caste-based atrocities. “Police had initially registered an FIR under sections 302 (murder), 147 (rioting) and 354 (attempt to outrage the modesty of a woman) of the IPC along with sections of the SC/ST Act against 12 people,” special public prosecutor Anand Pal Singh told TOI. “In the chargesheet that was filed, the murder charge was dropped. Instead, seven persons were charged under sections 306 (abetment of suicide), 504 (intentional insult) and 143 (unlawful assembly) of the IPC.” News reports had in 2010 reported that the police had said it could be an “accident or suicide”. Rajo had told the court that the accused had come with kerosene canisters around noon that day. “They hurled abuses at my daughters and said they would not spare them,” she had said. “They locked the doors and assaulted them. No one came to our rescue, despite my daughters’ screams. They poured kerosene over my house and burnt it down … I knew them all. They were from my neighbourhood.” During the trial, statements of 19 witnesses were recorded. “That included the mother, the government doctor and policemen. On February 23, 2021, the court added the murder charges again,” Singh said. “However, the accused were given the benefit of the doubt for murder. But they were found guilty under the SC/ST Act and abetment of suicide.” The special court judge, Sandhya Chaudhary, on Monday referred to the Nirbhaya judgement to say that “a court should not be unnecessarily generous while handing out punishment. If an incident has been proven, the punishment should be severe.” In its order, the court sentenced the seven accused — Satish Chandra Madan, Sagar Bhandula, Sonia Kohli, Asha Sachdeva, Amarjeet Kaur, Bunty Malik and Vinod Kakkad — to life imprisonment under Section 3 (2)(v) of the SC/ST Act (a non-member of SC/ST communities perpetrating offence under the IPC against a member of an SC/ST community). They have also been convicted for abetment of suicide (10 years’ imprisonment), unlawful assembly (six months' imprisonment) and intentional insult (two years in prison). A total cash fine of Rs 1.07 lakh each has also been imposed. Singh said, “An additional Rs 3.57 lakh will have to be paid to the girls’ mother Rajo. She has not appeared in court for a while and has recently moved away from Moradabad.” The brothers Rakesh, who worked as a sweeper, and Rajesh were sentenced to life for murder by a Moradabad court three years ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/11-yrs-after-2-dalit-sisters-were-burnt-alive-7-get-life-imprisonment-under-sc/st-act/articleshow/86405800.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

In response to Munde’s tweet, Gadkari’s office said that the minister has directed the officials concerned to take stern action against the contractor and ensure that all the damaged panels are replaced at the earliest. Earlier, a group of local residents from Patoda in Beed district (the NH passes through this area) had raised their voice against the bad road condition here. Led by social activist Ganesh Dhawale, the residents had written a letter to Gadkari. However, they claim the letter received no response. In the letter, the residents had pointed out that cracks had developed on the new road between Ghumra Pargaon and Anapatwadi villages in Beed district. Expressing displeasure at the poor quality of the road works, they had also questioned the alleged silence of local public representatives. While directly exposing the road-related issue on social media, instead of having a formal communication with Gadkari — a senior functionary of her own party — Munde is doing a balancing act by also praising the Union minister. “I will also write a letter to the honourable minister … he will also not tolerate this... and will give prompt attention,” Munde tweeted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/pankajas-tweet-more-effective-than-residents-letter/articleshow/86403806.cms||---

However, the team did not agree that all the deaths were due to fever and the department has ordered a probe into the matter. The report on fever-related deaths has surfaced at a time when Meerut is witnessing a spurt in dengue cases, which increased to 231 with 26 fresh cases reported on Tuesday. Villagers claimed that Rajkumar, Binny, Bhagmal and Subhash died of fever in the last 48 hours while Omveer died four days ago. They were all suffering from fever. The villagers also said that many in the area had fever. However, Dr Ashok Taliyan, divisional surveillance officer, said, “One person who was suffering from fever was a teenager. His rapid test for dengue was positive but the ELISA test wasn’t conducted. We are categorizing his death as fever death. Apart from this, two people have died due to prolonged illness and one due to a heart attack.” Dr Akhilesh Mohan, chief medical officer (CMO),told TOI that the villagers told the health department team that all were suffering from fever. “But we have learnt that other causes too were involved. We have set up an inquiry to find out the exact cause of death. A medical camp is being set up here for voluntary health checkup for all,” said the CMO. The health department officials said a door-to-door drive is also going on in the city to detect accumulation of stagnant water. So far, 18 notices had been issued to people in various areas in whose homes larva and stagnant water were found. Mohan urged people to follow all necessary precautions and take steps to prevent stagnant water from accumulating in order to tackle the vector-borne disease. "Even after conducting awareness drives and urging people to follow precautions, larvae are still being found at homes. I strongly appeal to people to maintain a clean environment," he added||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/four-die-of-high-fever-in-48-hours-in-meerut-village-many-ill-villagers-tell-health-team/articleshow/86405840.cms||Ishita Mishra

He went missing on August 26 when he went to attend coaching class. Police said action would be taken against those who blocked traffic Alka Chaudhary, chief proctor, said, “Police have done nothing to trace the missing student in the last 26 days and time is running out. We were left with no choice but to stage a protest here." Nand Kishore Bhat, Karmchaari Association president, accused police of intimidating the student’s family and threatening them not to agitate. "Now, the SSP has sent an additional SP to look into the matter and a meeting will be held with the police brass. Only after that, we will see what needs to be done." The missing student’s father, Narayan Hari Sharma, confirmed that policemen threatened to put him in jail if he staged a protest. Havin Khan, a student leader, alleged, “Police keep coming out with new theories. They have not even procured the CCTV footage related to the missing student's movement and they claim he has left on his own will with no proof to back their claim." Denying the accusations levelled against police as “fabricated”, Suraj Rai, circle officer, Sadar, and additional SP, said, "When I met all these people at the principal's office, none came forward claiming police had threatened the student's family.” Preliminary probe revealed that the student disappeared a day after he was engaged as he was not willing to get married. He also formatted his mobile phone and left it at home before leaving. Rai said action would be initiated against all those who blocked the traffic. "We will send notices to all those identified, including a woman who was instigating students to jam the road,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/meerut-college-unites-to-protest-police-apathy-in-tracing-missing-student/articleshow/86405860.cms||Sandeep Rai

J S Sanal is the officer who has received the disciplinary action. According to police department authorities, the suspension order was issued based on a report filed by the special branch (rural district) on allegations of custodial torture of a 35-year-old man, identified as Sudheer Khan. As per the complaint, the police team led by J S Sanal took Sudheer into custody on Sunday from Poovar petrol pump when he stopped his motorcycle to relieve himself. The cops first asked him for his vehicle's documents and when he walked towards the vehicle to fetch them, the SI thrashed him on his back using the lathi (baton). The cops then took him to the station and assaulted him further, ignoring his claim that he was a patient suffering from neurology related problems. The police also refused his family members to enter the station and see him following which the local people gathered outside the station and launched a protest, which eventually led to a preliminary inquiry by the police .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/si-suspended-for-custodial-torture/articleshow/86407990.cms||---

A sum of Rs 57 lakh was recovered from him. “This so far is the biggest recovery in terms of money in a cyber fraud case in Bareilly,” Rohit Singh Sajwan, Bareilly SSP, told TOI. He said Ruksaad was trying to leave Bareilly with Rs 27 lakh cash but was tracked and arrested on Bhuta-Bisalpur state highway. Later, police recovered Rs 30 lakh from his bank account. Ruksaad is an aide of Robert Otujeme, a resident of Lagos city in Nigeria who was arrested on August 25. He was involved in several cases of cyber fraud and was living in India on an expired visa since 2011. Bareilly SSP Sajwan said, “Earlier, the Nigerian told us that he siphoned off over Rs 2.5 crore from the current account of Ganesh Ecotech Pvt Ltd, a Kanpur-based firm, through email spoofing. This amount was transferred to multiple accounts and all the account holders were promised 20% commission on the money. Our cyber cell identified some of the accounts in which over Rs 30 lakh were transferred. The banks froze those accounts on our request.” The SSP added, “During our investigation, we found that Ruksaad had transferred Rs 27 lakh in his current account and had withdrawn the money. He was trying to leave Bareilly with the money but we managed to arrest him. He was carrying a keypad phone and hiding his location like an expert.” Police expect further breakthrough in this case after two accused, Mehandi Hasan and his son, Arbaaz Khan, who are at large are nabbed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/nigerian-cyber-criminals-aide-held-in-bareilly-rs-57l-recovered/articleshow/86405850.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

---||Nagpur||Is it correct to dispense with NEET?||Doing away with the centralized exam could undermine the maintenance of national education standards, and pose several challenges to studentsBy Dr Vikas Mahatme To maintain the national standards in education and develop scientific temper in the country, it is necessary to have a centralized exam pattern. The central government has the power to determine the standards of institutions for higher education. The Bill titled ‘The Tamil Nadu Admission to Undergraduate Medical Degree Courses Bill, 2021’ (hereinafter referred to as the ‘TN Bill, 2021’) attempts to do away with the NEET Bill passed in Parliament and ensures that admissions to medical colleges will be done by the authority concerned of the state government, following the normalization method. This goes against the standards laid by central government as well as the mandate given by the Supreme Court (SC). In the case of ‘Christian Medical Vellore Association vs Union of India’, a three-judge SC bench rejected the challenge to the provisions of Medical Council Act, 1956 and Dentists Act, 1948 and regulations by which a uniform NEET examination was made mandatory for admissions in medical and dental courses. The apex court has time and again taken a stance in favour of national standardised exams. In its judgment, SC emphasised the importance to have a systematic centralised selection procedure for advancing educational standards in the country. The court stated that “at present, education is devoid of its real character of charity; it has become a commodity.” The court further said that professional education in India suffers with large maladies and that the regulatory framework created by the Medical Council of India (MCI) and Dental Council of India (DCI) is concomitant of conditions, affiliation and recognition. It added that providing a central examination in the form of NEET does not violate any rights. Bypassing the constitutional structureAccording to the 42nd constitutional amendment, ‘education’ as a subject was removed from the State List and was added to the Concurrent List. Entries 25 and 26 of List III, Seventh Schedule state that education will be subject to the Concurrent List. Another clause mentions that it will be the duty of Centre to lay norms for maintaining educational standards. In the current case, the state government is headed towards political goals, not policy goals. In pursuing them, it is contradicting Centre’s policy and SC’s stance. This would likely lead to a jurisdictional overlap between Centre and the state government. Basis of the BillThe TN Bill, 2021 was brought forth after the recommendations made by the AK Rajan committee. The report by the committee mentions that NEET undermined societal representation in MBBS and higher medical studies. However, questions can be raised on the reliability of the report as it has not yet been made public. The report derives its mandate from the responses recorded from 86,000-odd persons requesting to scrap NEET. It mentions that NEET “favoured the rich” and elite. Students having a rural background and/or Tamil medium, those whose annual parental income is less than ₹2.5 lakh, and socially disadvantaged groups like the Most Backward Classes (MBCs), Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) were most affected. It is contended that the state government is within its constitutional rights to grant reservations to disadvantageous communities. TN has already breached the 50% limit determined by SC. The state’s cumulative reservation stands at around 69%. Way outThe claim of the Rajan committee that NEET only caters to elite and urban society can be rejected by several modes. Many states have granted reservations to girl students who qualify NEET. The TN government can provide special reservations to students from disadvantaged groups. The power to grant reservation in educational institutions lies with state governments, which is already used by TN for OBCs. The report states that only the rich can afford coaching classes to get medical seats after NEET. To tackle this, government schools can impart subsidized, quality education. The ministry of social justice and empowerment has a free coaching scheme for SC and OBC students. Instead of doing away with NEET, the state government can combine NEET scores and high school results (after normalization), and allot seats according to the merit list so prepared. In this way, the so-called elitist nature of NEET will be subsumed by the students who perform well in high school examinations. The state government can also lay down minimum qualifying marks after Class XII as an eligibility criterion. The method of normalization is given in the TN Bill, 2021, but it disregards the development of scientific temper and national status of NEET. A national policy cannot be rejected because a tiny fraction of students are unhappy with it. Lastly, the state government can increase medical colleges, especially in areas where the population of disadvantaged groups is higher. TN already has 42 allopathic medical colleges, the highest in the country. The government can then provide reservations in the domicile category for these colleges. This would provide representation to disadvantaged groups and maintain the quality of medical education. NEET is a better alternative to state-controlled education as it has reduced the commercialization of education in the country. Before NEET or other centralized exams, it was easier to give donations (usually black money) and reserve seats in colleges and universities. Centre eliminated the use of black money in admissions. As for the high fees of private colleges, education loan can be provided to poor students. The colleges should be responsible for it and state government can facilitate it. This Bill will lead to a lobby of private medical colleges; politicians will work so that their wards get admission. I am not doubting the intentions, but there is every chance that this will happen. Has the government considered sentiments of students who used to appear for 15-20 exams? Detrimental, people-pleasing politics should not overrule public policy, especially in matters of education. The TN government must keep its education on par with the national standards and must not provide poor, unconstitutional alternatives. Implementing the TN Bill, 2021 is likely to cause major issues later.

Khekhra police station SHO said, “The woman told us that she found her morphed nude pictures pasted on the walls outside her house and at several places in her locality.

While the family has alleged the 24-year-old athlete was raped — and charges that deal with rape have been registered against the accused — police have said it was a case of "murder and attempt to rape". The family of the Dalit woman, who was killed and brutalised when she was on her way home from a job interview, met chief minister Yogi Adityanath during an event in Bijnor on Tuesday to seek a re-investigation. “The chief minister promised them protection and sanctioned Rs 5 lakh for the family of the deceased,” a statement by Moradabad DIG Shalabh Mathur said. “Following the demands of the woman’s family, an SIT has been formed to investigate the case.” The family had also handed over a memorandum to the DM, Umesh Mishra, addressed to the governor and the CM, demanding justice, on Saturday. Police had earlier said it had solved the crime — a rope, a shirt with two missing buttons and a slipper had led them to a daily wage labourer who lived near the train tracks where the woman’s body was found. “Shahjad, 26, has confessed to his crime,” Bijnor SP Dharamveer Singh had said. Police had then said that it was “attempt to rape” and the autopsy report had only found evidence of murder “and no other crime”. Based on the woman’s father’s complaint, the FIR still mentions rape charges along with those of murder, concealing evidence and offences punishable with life or other imprisonment. But the woman’s family has been contesting this line of investigation. When her body was found, her clothes had been pulled down. “She was a sportsperson. She was strong. It is difficult to believe that one man, a supposed drug addict, overpowered her by himself. More men could have been present,” her father said. “Her phone is still missing.” She was on a call when she was attacked, her cries and screams recorded by her friend on the other side. While the friend shared the audio clip with the police, the woman’s phone has not been found, even with Shahjad’s arrest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/yogi-orders-sit-probe-into-natl-kho-kho-players-murder-rape/articleshow/86405943.cms||Harveer Dabas

The opposition provoked the public and tried to set the state on fire through violent protests. The rioters burnt the premises of various innocent businessmen. At that time, I had clearly said if you burn the shops then your coming generations would have to pay the price for it.” Moradabad, considered a brassware hub of the country, has witnessed communal riots on multiple occasions in the past along with its neighbouring Sambhal and Rampur districts which had also witnessed riots during the anti-CAA protests. A roadways bus was torched and several private and government vehicles were vandalised in Sambhal and police had registered over 200 cases for violence. Similarly, violence was reported from Rampur district where mob attacked policemen and curfew had to be imposed in sensitive areas. Notices were served to 26 protesters in Sambhal and 28 in Rampur to recover the money from them for destruction of public and private property. After inaugurating two oxygen plants in Moradabad, Adityanath said, “Every BJP MLA in the state has completed development works of over Rs 1500 crore during their present tenure. In comparison, the opposition parties' MLAs have nothing to do with the development of the state. For them, their self-development and the development of the Saifai family is everything.” The CM further said, “I would like to assure you that BJP will always provide you better law and order to safeguard your right to live respectfully in the state. Every mother and sister will have safety and respect.” Taking a dig at the violence reported in Moradabad region during the anti-CAA protests in 2019, Adityanath shared a tweet from his official Twitter handle after his speech in Moradabad. “Remember, if you burn the properties of innocent businessmen in UP then you would have to pay which will be remembered by your coming generations,” he tweeted. Adityanath also laid the foundation stones of development works of Rs 275 crore in Sambhal where the entry of the leaders of Bharatiya Kisan Union was restricted by the police and district administration. He also visited Bijnor and laid foundation stones for a few projects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/yogi-says-opposition-attempted-to-burn-state-through-anti-caa-protests/articleshow/86405919.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

As per India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast, more rainfall is in store for the region that has already received surplus showers. A yellow alert has been issued by the Met department for most parts of Marathwada, including Aurangabad district, with chances of heavy rain at some places for next 48 hours till Thursday. A day after witnessing few drizzle spells, Aurangabad also reported occasional spell of light to moderate rainfall on Tuesday. A total of 15 circles from Jalna district, three from Parbhani and one from Beed reported heavy showers between Monday and Tuesday morning, whereas eight districts of Marathwada reported average 19 mm of showers. Shriniwas Aundhkar, director of city-based APJ Abdul Kalam Astro Space and Science Centre, said depression formed over Bay of Bengal and its influence on the weather system during the current monsoon would produce rainfall in Marathwada and some other parts of the state for at least three days. “The withdrawal phase of monsoon has not begun yet that takes place every year by around September 17. It means an extended monsoon is more than certain this year,” he said. With the latest showers, Marathwada , which had received bashing from rainfall during the first half of the current month, has received average 841 mm rainfall so far since June 1. The total rainfall received so far accounts for 133% of expected showers and 124% of the season’s quota received by the region every year during the stipulated four months of the rainy season till September.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/heavy-rain-again-in-parts-of-marathwada/articleshow/86403903.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Kirit Somaiya emerges as BJP’s unlikely one-man brigade against MVA govt||MUMBAI: Kirit Somaiya has emerged as BJP’s sabre-rattling knight at a time when his party continues to hem and haw on whether to take on the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi or leave the beleaguered three-party alliance to its fate. Somaiya turned a hero for his party activists when he was detained by Karad police early on Monday. He was on his way to Kolhapur in connection with allegations of financial irregularities he has hurled against NCP minister Hasan Mushrif. Somaiya was scheduled to visit properties owned by Mushrif in Kagal. Somaiya’s strategy to target MVA ministers Anil Parab and Hasan Mushrif on corruption and submit evidence to the Enforcement Directorate and Income Tax department is at variance with his party colleagues, who indulge in pure rhetoric against MVA, said BJP watchers. “Whatever the merit of Somaiya’s allegations, he appears clear and precise in his mission. On the other hand, Chandrakant Patil and Pravin Darekar (senior BJP functionaries) keep parroting worn-out lines which lack punch,” said a BJP functionary. “Somaiya has emerged as the BJP’s one-man brigade who can cut the MVA to size ahead of the Mumbai civic elections,” he added. The police crackdown on Somaiya has left the MVA government red-faced. Many in MVA felt by banning Somaiya from entering Kolhapur district, police turned him into a crusader eager to lock horns with the state government. The Sena was quick to try and keep CM Uddhav Thackeray out of the controversy. But Sena’s damage-control exercise lacked political savvy. Paying scant regard to the concept of collective responsibility, Sena MP Sanjay Raut said Thackeray had nothing to do with the action initiated by the home department, held by the NCP. Home minister Dilip Walse Patil stood by police, adding he had no knowledge if the CM was briefed. “This must have been embarrassing for the MVA as it showed chinks in its armour,” said a former civil servant. Interestingly, many in the BJP are flummoxed by Somaiya’s rise. He was denied a party ticket for the 2019 LS elections, and he is considered to be L K Advani’s protege. Somaiya was, under BJP’s post-2014 dispensation, relegated to the sidelines as new leaders arrived on the scene in Mumbai North-East, his constituency.  Somaiya’s loyalists claim his anti-Sena campaign may help BJP consolidate its mercantile-trader votebank in suburban Mumbai ahead of BMC elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-somaiya-emerges-as-bjps-unlikely-one-man-brigade-against-mva-govt/articleshow/86412301.cms||Ambarish Mishra

Officers of the Narcotics Control Bureau, the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, and the Gujarat Anti-terrorism squad confirmed that concentrated efforts are being made to push heroin produced in Afghanistan into India. The officers said that the smugglers are likely to use the sea route via Iran. The officers said the drug lords fear confiscation of the heroin stock by the Taliban. Apart from staggering financial losses, the drug lords also face the prospect of summary execution if caught by the Taliban. These factors are fuelling drug runs into India, they said. Sources in the agencies said the possibility of more heroin ships being caught in Indian waters cannot be ruled out. “The DRI found about 3,000kg of heroin at Mundra port and the investigation is underway,” a senior NCB officer said. “The heroin was smuggled from Afghanistan, which is the biggest producer of opium. The country has labs to process opium into heroin.” Such huge stocks were never dispatched by the drug mafia, said the officer. “Their current push shows how desperate they are to dispose of their stock of heroin so that the Taliban don’t punish them or seize the contraband,” he said. According to the United Nations, harvesting of opium provided about 12,000 jobs in Afghanistan in 2019. It is also believed that the drug trade accounted for up to 60% of Taliban’s annual revenue. The Taliban had in 2000, during their first stint in power, banned opium cultivation. After capturing power this year, they again announced in August that they will crack down on narcotics. A senior ATS officer said, “The Taliban had been getting money from the illicit drug trade before they came into power.” He added: “Now the opium producers are trying to push the drug into India.” India is not just a receiver of drugs but has also been a route for drug ships, the officer said. .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/afghan-heroin-surge-looms-for-india-cops/articleshow/86408081.cms||Ashish Chauhan

Srikrishna (47) was picked up for illegal retail trading in nine benami companies and for non-reporting of demat account of Karvy to exchanges. “The undisclosed demat account was opened in January 2019 and client securities worth Rs 1,500 crore were shifted to this account from pooling accounts. They were later pledged to the banks to obtain a loan of Rs 700 crore. The details of the demat account were not disclosed to the stock exchanges or during the audit which is against the law,” informed a CCS official. The investigators alleged that the accused had also resorted to illegal retail trading through the trading accounts of nine benami shell companies and also through two trading accounts of a city-based doctor-couple. “The doctor-couple were friends of Karvy CMD C Parthasarathy. They had Rs 2 crore investment in the two trading accounts and the accused caused them a massive loss,” CCS assistant commissioner of police (ACP) SV Hari Krishna said. The case was registered based on a complaint from IndusInd bank.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sr-karvy-executive-held-by-ccs-for-illegal-retail-trading/articleshow/86410364.cms||Mahesh Buddi
---||Aurangabad||Maharashtra: Rain water mars painting in prominent cave at Ellora||AURANGABAD: The downpour during September has resulted in rain water seeping into cave number 32 at the world-renowned Ellora Caves here for the first time ever, causing some damage to a painting. The science branch of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has stepped in to control the damage. Some damage due to rain water seepage has also been reported in cave number 33 and other places at the world heritage site in the past few days following the incessant rains. Known as ‘Indra Sabha’, cave 32 is a two-storey architectural marvel excavated in the ninth century. It is considered as the largest and finest of the Jain caves at the Ellora site. ASI superintendent archaeologist (Aurangabad circle) Milan Kumar Chauley on Monday said no incidence of rain water seepage had ever been recorded at cave 32 in the past. “Due to the heavy rains during the first half of September, there was profuse seepage in different caves at Ellora, causing damage to some of the paintings. At cave 32, our science branch has given support to the damaged and loose painting by using a special mechanical jack and waterproof foam sheet to remove the rain water,” he said. Chauley said the seepage at cave 32 has been communicated to the ASI headquarters in New Delhi. “The ASI top brass is expected to undertake a joint survey of the Ellora Caves shortly by involving different experts. The visit will study the current geological status of the world heritage site for the purpose of preservation and conservation,” he added. Khuldabad tehsil in Aurangabad district, where the Ellora Caves are located, has received an excess 240mm rain in September so far — 217% of the normal rainfall. The taluka has recorded 865mm rainfall during the current monsoon since June 1, which is 136% of the expected showers, official data shows. Dating back from the 6th to 10th century, the Ellora Caves comprise 34 monasteries and temples excavated side by side in the wall of a high basalt cliff. Besides being an architectural marvel, the heritage site also embodies the spirit of tolerance as it has sanctuaries devoted to Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism at one place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/rain-water-seeps-into-prominent-jain-cave-at-ellora-damages-painting/articleshow/86403941.cms||Prasad Joshi
---||Aurangabad||Rajani Patil gets RS ticket||Aurangabad: The nomination of former MP Rajani Patil by the Congress for the upcoming by-election to the Rajya Sabha from Maharashtra, over many other stalwarts, took many by surprise. The election was necessitated following the death of sitting MP Rajeev Satav due to post-Covid complications. Patil, a former MP of Lok Sabha as well as Rajya Sabha, was considered the party’s choice for the Maharashtra Legislative Council (MLC). The 62-year-old, who is currently the party in-charge for Jammu and Kashmir, has been picked by Congress leadership ahead of former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan, ex-MPs Milind Deora and Sanjay Nirupam. Pradnya Satav, the widow of late Rajeev Satav, was also among the top contenders for the RS seat. While Pradnya was considered the frontrunner for the ticket, Congress brass said she might be considered for another important responsibility. “Pradnya’s name was among top choices before the party. Within weeks of her husband’s death, she was promoted to the position of vice-president of Maharashtra Congress. Since Rajeev was very close to Rahul Gandhi, Pradnya is expected to have a bright future in Congress,” a senior Congress leader said. In another twist to Rajya Sabha poll to be held in October, the BJP has announced the candidature of Sanjay Upadhyay, party general secretary of the Mumbai unit, which means Patil will not witness an unopposed election to Rajya Sabha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/rajani-patil-gets-rs-ticket/articleshow/86375201.cms||---
---||Trichy||Highways dept finds encroachments in Gandhi mkt||Trichy: The state highways department, which surveyed and marked the boundaries of the department’s land at the congested Gandhi Market locality, has identified several encroachments in the area covering the Thanjavur Main Road. Owing to the continuing traffic bottlenecks on the stretch, the residents have urged the state highways to evict the encroachments and widen the road.State highways department officials said that they had taken a policy decision to survey the roads maintained by highways to mark boundaries to avoid encroachments. As a part of the exercise, the department examined the 2.2km long Thanjavur main road linking the Palpannai intersection on Trichy-Chennai NH with Palakkarai RoB. The actual width of the road varies between 7 metres and 9 metres at several locations, and the road becomes too narrow, while crossing past the congested Gandhi Market. The survey has exposed many encroachments on the state highways land, including a portion of the compound wall of the market. The department has marked their boundaries by placing a yellow stone written with HD (highways department) mark at multiple locations to prevent further encroachments.“Traffic congestion near Gandhi market is getting worse. Widening the narrow road to an extent will be a relief. The state highways must evict the encroachments,” H Ramachandran, a trader at Gandhi Market, said. The establishments seem to have encroached the highways land for over decades.Dozens of shops, flag poles with stone tablets, a sanitary complex, compound walls of private and public properties have been built on the highways land. Clearing encroachments will widen the road by 2-7 feet. “We do not have immediate plans for evicting the encroachers,” an official source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/highways-dept-finds-encroachments-in-gandhi-mkt/articleshow/86410402.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Ahmedabad||South African cartel using persons of Indian origin as drug mules||AHMEDABAD: The narcotics control bureau (NCB), which is investigating a case of cocaine smuggling by a South African national, said a certain South African drug cartel has become active in India and they use people of Indian origin who use their Indian surnames to smuggle drugs into the country, as agencies would be less likely to see them as suspects. “The case of Derick Pillay, who was caught with 4.2kg of cocaine worth Rs 20 crore at city airport, is a fresh example of the handiwork of this South African drug cartel, who have started using people of Indian origin for narcotics smuggling,” said an officer of NCB. Pillay lived in Johannesburg and when he landed here, he was wearing a T-shirt with a print of the tricolour and Mahatma Gandhi on it. He was supposed to go to Delhi to watch the Independence Day celebrations. The officer said Pillay had been visiting India for about four years and had been used to carry out recces by the drug mafia. “He was never a carrier. He had come earlier and to identify security loopholes at various Indian airports. After he gave the green signal, the carrier would land in India with the drug consignment,” said the officer.  On August 14, Pillay was nabbed from Sardar Vallabbhbhai Patel International (SVPI) airport by NCB officers, who recovered cocaine worth Rs 20 crore from him. The drug was concealed inside a protein supplement packet. NCB officers had known that earlier people of African origin were used to smuggle the drugs. “As the African cartel got more notorious, their modus operandi became known and the security agencies and cops would keep a close watch on them and nab them on their arrival. After that, they started hiring people of Indian origin to smuggle the drugs as they would be less likely to be seen as suspects,” he said. These carriers usually make journeys with connecting flights and land at smaller cities in India, from where they are instructed by their bosses to travel further accordingly. “An area of concern is that these drug smugglers have begun sending major consignments to the national capital region, which has been seeing higher levels of drug supply than Goa, Mumbai or Bengaluru, which were earlier more notorious for drugs,” said an NCB officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/s-african-cartel-using-persons-of-indian-origin-as-drug-mules/articleshow/86408175.cms||Ashish Chauhan

Weathermen have forecast thunderstorm with moderate rain at a few places in the delta districts for at least five days from Tuesday. However, several places in the state including the delta districts have been receiving intermittent rain in the last 10 days, with Trichy clocking 14.40 mm in the last 24 hours. Farmers from the district have raised kuruvai paddy in about 15,000 acres, a major portion of it in Lalgudi block where harvest has begun. But the rain has damaged standing crops in a few villages, said N Veerasekaran, state spokesperson of Bharatiya Kisan Sangam. Preparatory works for samba paddy cultivation has picked up pace. If the normal area of cultivation in Trichy is about 1.10 lakh acres, it is expected to cover about 80% of the area this time considering the current Mettur reservoir storage level. Farmers from rainfed areas such as Thuraiyur, T Pettai, Musiri have started preparatory works for cash crops such as cotton, maize, red gram on hundreds of acres. However, those from non-delta areas such as Manikandam and Thiruverumbur blocks are yet to start the process, joint director of agriculture M Murugesan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/rain-turns-boon-for-samba-crop-upsets-kuruvai-harvest/articleshow/86410395.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Sena min files Rs 100cr defamation suit in HC||Mumbai: Transport minister and Shiv Sena leader Anil Parab filed a Rs 100 crore defamation suit against BJP leader Kirit Somaiya before the Bombay high court on Tuesday for his social media posts making allegations in relation to construction of a resort in Ratnagiri. Referring to Somaiya’s tweets, Parab’s suit states that the 66-year-old BJP leader must also give an “unconditional apology.” Parab is seeking that Somaiya be permanently restrained from making any such “motivated, unverified, frivolous, bogus and malafide” claims against him while alleging a scam involving an alleged illegal construction on a land at Dapoli in Ratnagiri. The contention of the Sena leader is that he has “no connection whatsoever” with the construction as alleged by Somaiya. Parab’s contention is that Somaiya on September 12 also tweeted about an office on Mhada land in Bandra. Parab said he issued a legal notice to Somaiya on September 14, calling on him to delete “all tweets” and tender an apology but with no response, he filed the suit through advocate Sushma Singh. “The defendant (Somaiya) has a known political rivalry with the plaintiff. In addition, the defendant, for several years, has had a personal envy and grudge against the plaintiff (Parab),” said the suit. Somaiya has about 3 lakh 17 thousand followers on the social media platform, Parab added. The imputations made by Somaiya have “not only caused tremendous hurt and harm” to him but also to his family members and relatives, Parab said in his suit. The “baseless” posts have “caused damage and injury to his good name and reputation,” he said, seeking interim orders to restrain Somaiya.

---||Ludhiana||MC unable to recover water, sewerage dues||Ludhiana: After increasing the water supply and sewerage rates, the civic authorities are facing tough times in collecting the dues for this financial year. A small percentage of residents has come forward for the payment. Last year, the MC had collected yearly charges from the residents in September by offering them a 10% rebate. But this year the bills were sent for six months because the charges were increased, still the collection has remained low. Till September 30, people will get a 10% rebate. For this financial year, from April 1 to September 16, the civic body has recovered Rs 9 crore from the defaulters whereas the target is around Rs 100 crore. Only 30,476 people have paid while around 1.38 lakh bills were dispatched by the officials. Another reason for delay in recovery of dues is that the bills were distributed late. The officials claimed if authorities had allowed covering the households in 125 square yards area, then they would have recovered more.A total of 1.48 lakh consumers are exempted from the water supply and sewerage bills. Even after passing a resolution in the MC general house meeting to roll back the exemption, mayor Balkar Sandhu announced its continuation under pressure from the opposition parties. Though there are no written orders, officials claimed due to elections, the political bosses took the decision and once the polls were over, people will have to pay up even if they were under the exempted category. The civic body has taken a loan from the World Bank for canal-based water supply project, the condition for which was metered water supply.An official said there was at least 60% increase in the water supply and sewerage dues and this was the reason they sent bills for six months first and in the coming days people would come forward to clear their dues.MC superintending engineer Ravinder Garg could not be contacted for comments. Long pending duesIn MC records, the total pending amount keeps rising every year and at the moment it is Rs 465 crore. To end pendency, the mayor had formed a committee of councillors and officials to settle the dispute cases, but the panel could do nothing. A few meetings took place, but pendency has increased more. In the beginning of the present regime’s tenure, pendency was around Rs 350 crore, but it has now increased to Rs 465 crore.Senior deputy mayor Shyam Sunder Malhotra, who is among the committee members, said, “There is a need to update the pending amount as the figure is not this high. In the past few meetings, I tried to settle the disputes, but the effort did not bear fruit. There is a need to upgrade the entire system.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/mc-unable-to-recover-water-sewerage-dues/articleshow/86405991.cms||---

---||Trichy||Three hamlets may not be merged with Trichy corpn||Trichy: The public hearing organised for recording the opinions of village panchayats identified for merger with Trichy Corporation and Lalgudi and Musiri municipalities concluded peacefully on Tuesday. While most of the panchayats will be added to Trichy Corporation as per the expansion plan, the district administration is considering excluding three hamlets in different panchayats based on eligible exclusion criteria. After expansion, Trichy Corporation may add around 1.5 lakh population to the fold and may witness the wards surge to 88 from 65.District collector S Sivarasu informed that population density of 386 people per square kilometre and 75% of the workforce in the panchayats employed in non-agriculture sector were the key parameters considered for merging villages with the corporation. “We will examine the qualifying conditions to merge the villages. Many wetlands have been converted to residential plots, only eligible panchayats will be amalgamated,” the collector said. In Navalpattu panchayat, the villagers have placed a demand to exclude a hamlet from the merger. The south of Navalpattu has Elcot IT park and Tamil Nadu Housing Board properties, which is most likely to be added to Trichy city. A portion of hamlets in Punganur and Madhavaperumalkoil have also sought exclusion. “We have not excluded any villages so far. If the demand is reasonable and genuine, we will consider,” the collector said. The exclusion will not be entertained if any panchayat was marooned with hamlets added to the corporation. A portion of Adavathur panchayat in Manikandam block is likely to be added to the city while Panayakurichi panchayat earlier identified for the merger is likely to be excluded. Meanwhile, a section of villagers cited the loss of income through MGNREGA for women as a discouraging factor. “We have to pay higher water and property taxes. Our village already has all the basic amenities needed,” said T Arockiyaraj, a ward member of Kizhakurichi panchayat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/three-hamlets-may-not-be-merged-with-trichy-corpn/articleshow/86410413.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: All eyes on Huzurabad bypoll date, delay makes BJP jittery||HYDERABAD: Timing of the Huzurabad bypoll is proving to be crucial. While the ruling TRS is expected to make the most of the delay in the announcement of the poll schedule by the Election Commission of India, the BJP is keen on an early by-election. The TRS believes it can reach more number of voters with more number of schemes and freebies. While the state BJP leadership is trying everything in its ambit to ensure that the by-election is held as early as possible before the ‘sympathy factor’ for former minister Eatala Rajender burns out among the voters. Eatala had resigned as an MLA on June 1. Since then the constituency has been waiting for a by-election. He joined the BJP and is most likely to be the party’s candidate for the bypoll. Both the TRS and Eatala have been vigorously campaigning in the constituency for more than three months now. Except for making its presence felt through graffiti and banners with a few rallies, Congress has not been as visible as the TRS and BJP. Local leaders of Congress informed the party leadership that any further delay on the part of the party think-tank to announce its candidate may affect its electoral prospects. “We have told the party leadership that the contesting candidate from Congress has to be projected now as the TRS and BJP are way ahead in terms of campaigning,” said a senior Congress leader from Huzurabad. Though Congress had a formidable candidate in P Kaushik Reddy who had polled over 60,000 votes against Eatala in 2018 assembly polls, he joined the TRS and has even been recommended by the state cabinet for an MLC berth. The file is pending with the governor’s office. The think-tank of Congress is expected to meet on Saturday to take a final call on whether to announce its candidate or wait till there is clarity on the bypoll date. The talk in political circles is that the Election Commission may announce the bypoll schedule after Dasara and hold the election after Deepavali.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/all-eyes-on-huzurabad-bypoll-date-delay-makes-bjp-jittery/articleshow/86410486.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Hyderabad||Congress, TRS cadre clash outside Revanth Reddy’s residence in Hyderabad; 3 injured||HYDERABAD: The ongoing war of words over ‘white challenge’ between TRS working president KT Rama Rao and Telangana Congress president A Revanth Reddy took a violent turn on Tuesday when activists of the rival parties clashed outside the residence of the Malkajgiri MP in Jubilee Hills. Three activists of TRS Vidyarthi Vibhag (TRS student wing) were injured when they clashed with stones and sticks. Police booked cases under Section 324 of the IPC against Congress cadre. “No arrests have been made in the case,” Jubilee Hills inspector S Rajasekhar Reddy said. Trouble started when a group of TRS students’ wing leaders went towards Revanth Reddy’s residence. The TRS activists claimed that they were going to hold a protest at TPCC chief’s residence and burn his effigy when the Congress members attacked them. On seeing the TRS activists rushing towards Revanth’s house, Congress members tried to stop them, resulting in a clash.  Leaders of Congress and TRS lashed out at KTR and Revanth respectively in separate media conferences stating they were crossing the decency limits. TPCC vice-president Mallu Ravi said: “The voice of the opposition is being suppressed by TRS government. What is wrong in Revanth’s white challenge which is aimed at making Telangana state free of drugs? Instead, KTR chose to file a case against Revanth Reddy, which is nothing but a move to escape from undergoing drug test.” TPCC campaign committee chairperson Madhu Yashki Goud said: “If BJP is sincere in its allegations of corruption by KCR family in irrigation projects, then it should ensure that an impartial inquiry is done by central investigating agencies into the allegations against KCR family.” TRS legislators A Jeevan Reddy, G Balaraju and Gadari Kishore said the TPCC president should take up the challenge of getting funds for Telangana from the central government. They suggested that Revanth should submit evidence if he has to police and other enforcement agencies against drugs usage in Telangana. TRS MLA Jeevan Reddy said: “While KTR is the brand ambassador of progress and development in Telangana, Revanth Reddy is the brand ambassador for blackmailing. Complaints will be lodged in every police station against Revanth if he continues to make defamatory comments against KTR, and also tarnishing the image of Brand-Hyderabad and Telangana.” Government whip G Balaraju said: “Revanth should convince Rahul Gandhi to undergo the drug test as challenged by KTR.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cong-trs-cadre-clash-outside-revanths-residence-3-injured/articleshow/86408221.cms||Roushan Ali
---||Ahmedabad||HC quashes farmer status of WWII veteran’s widow||Ahmedabad: Following the objections registered by the state government, the high court has quashed an order passed by the Gujarat Revenue Tribunal (GRT) to issue an agriculturist certificate to the widow of a World War II soldier. The status of being a farmer was cancelled for another reason — the family in question is from Kerala, though the ex-Army man was domiciled in Gujarat after his military service ended in 1947. Moreover, the soldier had not completed five years in the Army. Besides, the high court in its order last week also observed that the widow is 82 years old and giving her the status of agriculturist at such an old age will not serve the objective of the government policy. The case involved Minakshiben Nair, whose husband Karunakaran Nair served in the Army between 1942 and 1947, and was a recipient of the star award. After retiring, he accepted a job with the Godhra municipality. The Gujarat government came out with a resolution in 2001 that it would grant agriculturist certificates to ex-Army personnel. Nair applied for the conferment of the farmer’s status in 2013. A year later, he passed away at 94. Nair’s widow pursued the petition, which was rejected by the district collectorate saying that she was not eligible for the status of agriculturist as the policy was for ex-servicemen of only Gujarat. The state did not consider her appeal either. This led her to the GRT, which in 2017 ordered that she be granted the status of agriculturist and that she could purchase agricultural land in Gujarat. The government approached HC against conferment of the status to the widow arguing that she did not meet the eligibility criteria. Justice A Y Kogje accepted the government’s contention and quashed GRT’s order. The court said that the ex-serviceman was gainfully employed in the municipality and had received salary and pension too. Therefore, granting of land or status of agriculturist to support finances did not apply in this case, the court said. “Additional factor is that the respondent is already 82 years old,” the court said. “…and at this age, granting of the status of agriculturist is definitely not going to serve the objective with which the Government Resolutions are passed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-quashes-farmer-status-of-wwii-veterans-widow/articleshow/86408240.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Schools stop online classes||Jaipur: The joint director of school education has written to CBSE Ajmer to take steps to ensure that Maharani Gayatri Devi (MGD) School and Subodh Public School resume online classes for students who failed to pay fees. Parents complained that students were barred from online classes for non-payment of fees. Abhibhavak Ekta Sangh, Rajasthan, a parents’ association, had approached the education department complaining against the two schools. Joint director of school education Ghanshyam Dutt Jaat wrote to CBSE to instruct schools to restart online classes for students who could not pay the fees. Manish Vijayvargiya, president of the parents’ association that filed the complaint said, “These private schools have been pressurising parents amidst pandemic to pay fees, which is against the order of Supreme Court that said schools cannot bar students from online classes. Both schools have barred students from online classes at a time when their half-yearly examination was on.” Both the schools have denied the allegations. MGD School principal Archana Mankotia said all the students were attending online classes and no one was barred. “We have not barred anyone from online classes and our half-yearly examinations are going,” said Mankotia. Subodh Public School principal Kamaljeet Yadav said online classes are continuing for students except for a handful who haven’t paid fees. “Some students haven’t paid fees since last year. They haven’t complied by Supreme Court order that mentioned 85% school fees has to be paid,” said Yadav. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/schools-stop-online-classes/articleshow/86410471.cms||---

Of these, the maximum were thefts cases (1,214), followed by violation of the orders of public servant (856), hurt / scuffle cases (517), obstruction on public way (227), forgery / cheating / fraud (220) and burglaries (215), among others.The report shows the crime graph in the city has been on the decline over the past two years. In 2018, as many as 6,001 cases under the IPC were registered, which reduced to 5,230 in 2019 and 4,808 in 2020.The police filed charge-sheet in only 62.1% of the cases reported the previous year.The NCRB has categorized cases under the IPC in five categories: offence affecting human body, offence against public tranquility, offence against property, offence against document and property marks and miscellaneous IPC crimes. Further, these categories are divided under different crimes.The city has always been on the target of vehicle-lifters. On an average, the city police bust at least three to four gangs of vehicle-lifters in a week. Of 1,214 theft cases in the previous year, 721 were of vehicle thefts and 493 of others. Of the 215 burglaries, 174 were reported at nighttime and 41 in daytime.Under the category of hurt, 517 cases were reported, including 433 of simple hurt and 84 of grievous.

Vehicle theft cases are high in the city. The police have been arresting the accused and recovering the stolen vehicles from them. Usually, the stolen vehicles are sold at cheap prices or used in other crimes like snatching, robbery and drug peddling.”“The imposition of curfew restricted people’s movement. Those who came out without a reason were booked for disobeying the orders of public servant and 856 such FIRs were lodged,” she added.“The police have been arresting the criminals and lodging them behind bars. This could be the reason that the crime graph is decreasing,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/crime-graph-falls-for-second-year-in-a-row/articleshow/86406040.cms||Payal Dhawan

Addressing a public meeting at Nizamsagar crossroad in Kamareddy as part of BJP state chief Bandi Sanjay Kumar’s ‘Praja Sangrama Padayatra’, he said: “Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has not fulfilled any of his promises, be it waiving loans for farmers or providing jobs. There will be no rest until the TRS family rule and corruption ends.”  The next election would be a fight between TRS and BJP, he added. Javadekar said that CM KCR managed government from his farmhouse and claimed people in the state were ruing electing TRS. “TRS government is not people’s government. It is all about KCR’s son, daughter, nephew and other family members. People in the state now want a change of guard and development,” he said.

---||Jaipur||Jaipur police suspect gang rivalry behind murder at Bani Park||JAIPUR: City police suspect the involvement of a local gang behind the grisly murder of Ajay Yadav (42). “It appears to be the handiwork of a local gang because the accused could not have travelled very far on scooters. The way a magazine dropped also indicate weapons were not in inexperienced hands,” an official said, adding Yadav may have drew the ire of many gangs in the city. “He was acquainted with top bosses of different gangs operating in Jaipur. We had learned that he had once provided help to a gangster and his aides. These gangs have no permanent friends or foes,” the official said, adding that Yadav grew due to his connections with people in the higher echelons of power which may have irked a lot of other gangs. Police said over a dozen gangs and their underlings are under the scanner after Yadav’s murder. “He was politically active too, he may have thrown his weight around which could have upset some people,” the official claimed. Yadav has nine cases in five thanas: Ajay Yadav was involved in nine cases filed at five different police stations including Bajaj Nagar, Bani Park, Sodala and Gandhi Nagar. As per his history sheet at Sadar police station, the first case was filed in 1997 at Sadar police station. He was exonerated in three cases while four are pending in courts. In 2016, Yadav was sent to judicial custody by Jawahar Nagar police station in a case related to an attempt to murder, arms Act and criminal conspiracy. The last case was filed against him in Sadar thana in 2018 when he was booked under Section 307 (attempt to murder), and 323 (causing hurt).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/police-suspect-gang-rivalry-behind-murder-at-bani-park/articleshow/86410496.cms||---

The Sena said in its mouthpiece Saamna that BJP was using Central agencies like the ED and CBI to put pressure on the Maharashtra government, but despite these tactics, the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in the state “was not falling,” and this had frustrated BJP leaders. Saamna said in the editorial that some BJP leaders thought the ED and CBI “are in their pocket” and used them to threaten political opponents. “Making a statement that you will have sleepless nights in facing the ED is nothing but arrogance. Who will have sleepless nights facing the ED we will see, but despite pressure from the Centre, the Maharashtra government is not falling. This is giving the BJP sleepless nights. (State BJP chief Chandrakant) Patil has threatened...Maharashtra minister Hasan Mushrif……with ED. Former MP Kirit Somaiya has made allegations against Hasan Mushrif.

As per sources, the control room radioed all Chetaks (mobile patrolling unit) to immediately mount a vigil on important checkpoints of the city to find the suspects involved in Yadav’s murder. “Vidhayakpuri’s Chetak team was also mandated to join the patrolling effort. Contrary to the stipulated directions, the team did not reach the area for patrolling,” an official said. Seniors officials later asked the team members about the reported negligence. The team replied that they were involved in a different work related to the investigation. Their reply failed to cut any ice and the staff was shunted out. Additional commissioner of police (crime) Ajay Pal Lamba confirmed that disciplinary action was necessitated due to reported negligence. Meanwhile, the control room ordered ‘Category A’ patrolling on city routes, especially over two dozen routes that lead to highways on western stretches of Jaipur. All cops were directed to keep their firearms. The incident, however, has exposed many security chinks. The murder took place in full public view amidst a swelling crowd at a bustling place. Till late Tuesday night, there was no clue of the accused. This is the second murder within 30 days that a person was was shot and killed in broad daylight.

This comes in the wake of all students of II PU getting promoted this year, bringing 2 lakh more to the admission pool. While some varsities like Bengaluru City University and Karnatak University have issued orders regarding increase in intake, affiliated colleges are still waiting for an order from respective universities. The higher education department issued an order on September 16 in this regard. Many colleges said they were waiting for universities to grant permission so that they could add more seats. The demand is more for BCom, BBA, BCA and other commerce courses. Humanities and science courses — going by the present trend — might not warrant seat increase on a big scale.

---||Jaipur||Jaipur: Garbage trucks not reaching most areas, trash is piling up, say councillors||JAIPUR: Despite sanitation workers withdrawing their strike, garbage collection vehicles are not reaching most parts of the city. Councillors of both the civic bodies are complaining about tonnes of garbage being piled up in their areas. Last week, sanitation workers of the company that lifted garbage went on a strike as their salaries weren’t paid. Though the issue had been resolved, the sanitation condition hasn’t improved in the city. Ward 9 councillor of JMCHeritage Raja Bishnoi said in 70% ward areas, no vehicle was going to lift trash for the last three months. Even when vehicles arrive, they don’t cover the entire ward. Ward 72 councilor Lalita Jaiswal said she receives calls from residents every day about vehicles not reaching their areas. In Amber, Chaura Rasta, Bapur Bazar, Govind Devji marg, Gangauri Bazaar, Shastri Nagar and Kachi Basti, vehicles arrive to lift garbage once in five days. Out of 750 garbage trucks which used to cover the entire city, the number has now dipped to 350. Ummed Singh Dheerawat of BVG company, which is responsible for garbage collection, claimed work was being done properly. “Work is ongoing efficiently with sufficient number of vehicles. In all wards, vehicles are going on time. We will look into it if there is a problem.” In JMC-Greater’s Vidhyadhar Nagar, Kho Nagoriyan and Jhotwara areas, vehicles hardly reach on time. In the last one month, more than 100 complaints have been filed by residents against garbage collection. Ward 62 councillor of JMC-Greater Nawal Kishore said most of the areas is not covered by the vehicles. “If we ask them the reason, drivers reply they are not paid or their vehicles are not functioning.” Narendra Singh and Suresh Jangid, councilors of different wards of JMC-Greater, also echoed similar problems. There have been cases in which colony members are paying the drivers to come to their lanes on time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/garbage-trucks-not-reaching-most-areas-trash-is-piling-up/articleshow/86410649.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Blame conservative mindset for low rural female literacy, say experts||JAIPUR: With almost 50% women in Rajasthan unable to read and write, the tall claims of the state being an education hub with the highest number of women universities and colleges have fallen flat. The significant gap of 23% in literacy levels among males and females further question the discrimination against women. We bring to you a five-part series on gender inequality in the desert state. Read on… Thinly populated areas, conservative mindset, poor economic conditions and failing policies are reasons behind the low literacy rate among women in the rural areas of the state, say experts. Formed in 1950, Rajasthan had the worst literacy rate of 8.5% in 1951 in the country. Even after 70 years, the state continues to lead the chart from the bottom with the worst literacy rate among its female population. According to a recent study conducted by the National Statistical Organisation on the survey report, Household Social Consumption (July 2017 to June 2018), almost every second woman in Rajasthan’s villages cannot read, write or perform simple calculations. On the contrary, the male literacy rate in the state is more than 80.8%, which is just 4% lower than the country’s overall literacy rate. Taboos linked to women’s education:The gender gap has a lot to do with the geography of the state. Desert covers more than 60% of the state, including nine districts. Hence, these areas are less accessible and are pulling the literacy rate down. “The sparsely populated areas combined with conservative mindset have deterred all social movements related to literacy programmes. Stories of oppression against women by invaders constitute a huge part of the oral history among the rural communities. This has turned practices which lead to the exposure of women to strangers into taboos,” said Rashmi Jain, head of the sociology department at Rajasthan University. According to the 2011 Census, Jaisalmer, Jalore and Sirohi have female literacy rates below 40%, while Kota, Jaipur and Jhunjhunu have more than 60% female literacy rates. Also, several villages in Mewat region have recorded less than 5% literacy rate among females in the 2011 Census. Effect on workforce:The literacy rate corresponds to poor sex ratio, low per capita income, poverty, poor enrollments in institutes and sustaining orthodoxy. The biggest casualty of the situation is the overall poor workforce in the state. The demographic and statistics wing of the state government said barely 12% of females were engaged in economic activities in urban areas, while 35.1% women were earning in the rural areas, which accounted for a total workforce population of 43.6%. However, Jhunjhunu with 75% rural population is an exception to come in the league of the top three districts. Jaipur and Kota have the highest density of schools and colleges per lakh population giving its populous upper edge in literacy over other worst-performing districts. Failing policies:KB Kothari, former policy and planner at the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), recalled that slight growth in the literacy rate continued in the country till 1991. “Thereafter, the union government along with state governments began tailormade literacy programmes to suit the social dynamics of the respective states with the help of international agencies,” said Kothari. Almost all literacy programmes in the state have failed to achieve their targets due to poor infrastructure, lack of accessibility, high pupilteacher’s ratio, overcrowded classrooms and declining funds for basic literacy programmes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/blame-conservative-mindset-for-low-rural-female-literacy/articleshow/86412512.cms||Shoeb Khan
---||Delhi||Delhi: Mixing dry and wet waste will cost you||NEW DELHI: Come January 1, residents of east Delhi will have to pay a fine if they do not segregate their household waste. Those who do not segregate the household garbage will face penalty action at the rate of Rs 200 per default starting from January 1, 2022, stated an order issued by East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) on Tuesday. For other violations, such as failure to dispose of construction and demolition waste properly, the penalty amount will go up to Rs 1,000 for residential and Rs 5,000 for non-residential areas, it added. For commercial, non-residential, institutional and industrial areas, fines will be imposed for violation of waste management norms from November 1 onwards. The penalty amount will range from Rs 500 (per default) to Rs 1 lakh depending on the nature of violation. EDMC commissioner Vikas Anand said that the civic body had implemented door-to-door collection of garbage in all 64 wards. “Now that the services are being provided, we expect the public to follow the norms strictly to avoid action. Implementation is more important to make east Delhi neat and clean and also, to improve the rankings in Swachh Survekshan,” he said. Failure to segregate and store waste in other categories, such as party lawns or marriage halls, will amount to a penalty of Rs 10,000 per default. For cinema halls, pubs and multiplexes constructed on less than 5,000 sqm area, the penalty will be Rs 5,000; and for non-residential entities on area less than 5,000 sqm, the fine amount will be Rs 500. The civic body had imposed user charges on commercial, institutional and industrial areas from July onwards. “However, we are not taking user charges from residential areas so far and expect people to fully cooperate with us in keeping the areas clean,” said a senior EDMC official. The east corporation has asked its waste generators to collect the solid waste in covered bins and hand it over to designated waste collection vehicles. The civic body on Tuesday also conducted awareness activities for all stakeholders, including RWAs, market associations, NGOs and industrial associations, to educate them on the importance of waste segregation at source. “This exercise will continue for the next one month,” said a senior EDMC official. The norms for segregation of waste at source will be implemented from December 1 for residential areas and from October 2 for commercial, non-residential, institutional and industrial areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mixing-dry-and-wet-waste-will-cost-you/articleshow/86410643.cms||Vibha Sharma

On Tuesday, Bodeli received over 5 inches of rain in eight hours, while Jetpur Pavi got 4.8 inches of rain. Water levels of the two major dams of the district – Sukhi and Rami – also increased. An alert has been issued for releasing 12,000 cusec waters from Sukhi dam since over 95% of its storage level has been filled. However, until late in the evening, the authorities had not started releasing water. In Bodeli town, water entered many houses in the low-lying areas and people had gathered on the banks of Orsang river to witness the river flowing in full spate.

---||Jaipur||JMC-Greater councillors speak out against mayor||Jaipur: Performance pressure on JMC-Greater mayor Sheel Dhabai is rising with majority of the councillors claiming that none of the promises made by her had been implemented. They said though 11 months have passed since the board was formed, none of the civic work is getting approval. When Somya Gurjar was mayor, Rs 1.35 crore worth of civic work was promised in every ward. But following her ouster, the new mayor hasn’t started anything. Soon after coming to power, Dhabai promised to improve sanitation facility in seven days, laptops for councillors, officers for councillors, two workers for each councillor, more equipment for sanitation workers, among other things. But all that has remained on paper. Ward 70 councillor Ramavatwar Guha (BJP) said the condition of corporation was degrading every day. “No civic work is going on since the formation of board. Routine work like sewer cleaning, garbage collection and garden maintenance work has also stopped in certain wards. Councillors will soon become agitated as the public will question them,” said Guha. On Monday, BJP councillors sat on a protest against their own board as no civic work was being done in their wards and nothing promised by Dhabai was implemented in four months after she came to power. Another BJP councillor and chairman of a committee said Dhabai is a dummy mayor working on the orders of the state government. “She is not capable of doing anything,” he said while refusing to be named. Not just BJP councilors, Congress councilors are also openly raising their voices against Dhabai although she was nominated by the Congress. Nawal Kishore Sharma, a Congress councilor, said they were not expecting laptops and other facilities from the corporation, but at least hoped to resolve civic problems in their wards. Ward 62 councillor Vijendra Saini said the current scenario was poor as if like there was no mayor at present.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jmc-greater-councillors-speak-out-against-mayor/articleshow/86410622.cms||---

G Naveen Kumar (41), a native of Bhadrachalam, works as an RMP at Laxmi Devunipally near Palvancha in Khammam district. “As his earnings were not sufficient to meet his expenses, Naveen hatched a plan to commit theft in buses.

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra ACB gets go-ahead for 2nd open inquiry against Param Bir Singh||MUMBAI: Maharashtra Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) on Monday received sanction to initiate an open inquiry against former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh on the complaint of inspector Bhimrao Ghadge alleging criminal conspiracy, destruction of evidence and corruption. This is the second open inquiry initiated by the ACB against Singh. In July, the state home department had given a go-ahead to initiate an open inquiry against Singh on charges of corruption levelled by police inspector Anup Dange. TOI tried to call and also texted Singh but there was no response. In June, the ACB had initiated these two discreet inquiries which have now been converted into open inquiries. A discreet inquiry is a preliminary probe in which the ACB attempts to corroborate a complaint received against a public servant. Reports of these inquiries are then forwarded to the concerned department where the public servant works, seeking a sanction to further proceed from inquiries to investigation. According to ACB manual, discreet inquiries have to be completed within three months. Based on the findings, either an open inquiry can be ordered or an FIR registered or the probe may be closed if the allegations turn out to be baseless. In March, inspector Bhimrao Ghadge of Kalyan police had lodged an FIR against Singh and 32 other officers alleging while he was probing a cheating case pertaining to KDMC officials, Singh, who was the Thane police commissioner then, misused his official position and submitted a closure report despite there being strong documentary evidence. Ghadge, who was posted in Thane police commissionerate in 2015-18, demanded an in-depth inquiry against Singh. In 2015, Ghadge himself was suspended by Singh on alleged corruption charges. Ghadge said Singh had framed him in a false case and got him arrested. He also alleged Singh had amassed assets by settling disputes and extorted money from builders and transport lobbies.  Now, the ACB wants to conduct an open inquiry where even Singh will be provided an opportunity to defend himself. Meanwhile, a team led by superintendent of state CID Manik Jagtap that had gone to Chandigarh to serve a bailable warrant against Singh to appear before Justice Chandiwal commission, returned to Mumbai on Monday without serving the order. Justice Chandiwal commission was set up by the state government to probe Singh’s allegations of corruption against former state home minister Anil Deshmukh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-acb-gets-go-ahead-for-2nd-open-inquiry-against-param-bir/articleshow/86412522.cms||Ahmed Ali

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Schools start classes, but keep buses off roads||HYDERABAD: While schools were ordered to reopen on September 1, most school buses haven’t taken to the roads yet. School managements, especially the private budget ones, want the state to waive off road tax until December 31 as well as extend validly of fitness. State is yet to take a decision. The managements claim they would have to shell out Rs 40,000-50,000 on each bus for pending dues and repairs. “Not even one per cent of schools have started school buses in the city. Across the state, about 5% may be providing transportation,” said S Srinivas Reddy, honorary president of Telangana Recognised School Managements Association (TRSMA). Reddy, who also owns a private budget school in city, said most schools were not running buses for fear of vehicles being seized for want of documents. TRSMA members had met finance minister T Harish Rao in first week of September and sought road tax waiver as well as extension of document validity till end of this year citing financial constraints. The state has already waived off road tax for all transport vehicles for two quarters from April to September 2020. “Many are finding it difficult to pay school fees. I don’t think they will be interested to pay transport fees in the current situation,” said TRSMA president Shekhar Rao. Some parents, however, said that it would be better if schools started buses as it would be much safer than public transport. “My son is in class 10 and we stay in Chandanagar. His school is in Kukatpally. I want my son’s school to start transport as early as possible so that he can travel safely,” said Maheshwari V, a parent. A few schools, especially those who discontinued online teaching and made physical classes mandatory, are plying buses. “Buses will ply on all routes and lunch/snacks will be provided in the school as always,” read a message from an international school.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/schools-start-classes-but-keep-buses-off-roads/articleshow/86408411.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

Samples will now be collected from 8am to 3.30pm, officials said on Tuesday. With the new robotic “smart lab” being functional since July 2020, over 50,000 individual tests are already being conducted in a day. The lab has a capacity to conduct over two lakh tests daily, officials said. Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya visited the lab on Monday and reviewed its functioning. Dr Subrata Sinha, head of the laboratory medicine department at AIIMS, said that earlier, the number of samples that could be collected and processed daily was comparatively limited, with 2,000 individual samples being processed in a day and each one being subjected to an average 20-25 tests. Samples of the outpatient department were earlier collected till forenoon and those with fasting used to give samples till 10.30am. “According to the recent order issued on September 18, because of our increased ability to process samples, we have increased the collection time till 3.30pm for all samples, and for those who require fasting, samples will be collected till 11.30am,” Dr Sinha said. “These will enable many more patients who have been advised investigations, including from the morning OPD, to give samples on the same day, thereby not requiring them to visit the facility another day.” On Saturdays, the timing at the old Raj Kumari Amrit Kaur (RAK) OPD is from 8am to 10.30am, and at the new RAK OPD, from 8am to 1pm. With the new robotic laboratory, results of more than 95% of the investigations are made available on the collection day. This particularly applies to investigations involving haematology (haemoglobin, blood counts etc) clinical chemistry (glucose, liver and kidney function tests etc) and serology (related to antibodies to infectious viral agents etc), he explained.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aiims-smart-lab-to-collect-samples-for-3-hours-extra/articleshow/86408460.cms||---
---||Ludhiana||Bouncing back, garment inc faces tax needles||Ludhiana: In a setback to the garment and textile manufacturers and consumers, from January 1, GST on the articles used by the industry, like yarn, fabric, cloth, will be increased to 12%. According to taxation experts and businessmen, this move will lead to an increase in the prices of garments and textile articles for end consumers and also hike the cost of investment for the businessmen. Presently, there are some input items on which 5% GST is applicable, but on the end products made out of these (like garments) the rate is 12% and businessmen have to claim the 7% difference of the GST as input tax credit (ITC) from the department. But with this new decision they will now pay 12% GST on their purchases too and this, they say, will increase their cost of investment. However, the GST authorities decided the new rules to counter the problem of bogus billing, which is being executed by gangs to take advantage of the 7% GST difference. Taxation expert NK Thamman says, “At present, GST on all types of fabrics is 5%. Similarly, GST rate is 5% on garments and made-up textile articles of sale value not exceeding Rs 1,000 per piece. The input material of some goods like yarn (other than natural yarns) attracts 12% GST, while most others have 5% GST. The units manufacturing these items are claiming refund of ITC due to this duty structure. This was leading to fraudulent refunds.”“The GST council had discussed correcting this duty structure in an earlier meeting too, but deferred the decision for an appropriate time. Now, in its 45th meeting held recently, it proposed to increase GST on all textile articles to 12% so that there will be no refund due to unutilised ITC. However, this move will increase the prices of garments and made-up textile articles for end consumers,” Thamman adds.Criticising the move, Harish Kairpal, finance secretary of the Knitwear Club, says, “We are with the government against its fight against bogus billing, but increasing GST by 7% on all the items that currently attract 5% tax will have serious repercussions on the garment and textile manufacturers. Our cost of investment will rise steeply and retail consumers will also suffer as rates of garments and textile articles will be increased due to this tax difference. We urge the GST council to find some other way to check bogus billing problem.”According to Narinder Mittal, general secretary of Ludhiana Business Forums, “Increase in GST by 7% will prove to be a big setback for the industry as we are already facing severe fund crunch due to lockdowns. Just when the garment and textile manufacturers were hoping for some relief from the government for revival, we have been given a shock.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/bouncing-back-garment-inc-faces-tax-needles/articleshow/86406223.cms||Mohit Behl

While police completed investigation, neighbours alleged that the minor was subjected to physical abuse.Agriculture University assistant professor Kirti Singh from Begusarai, who lives in a rented accommodation in Sriram Colony under Borekheda police station, rushed the girl to a private hospital in the city on Thursday morning where doctors referred her to Government Maharao Bhimsingh Hospital. However, the assistant professor allegedly hired another ambulance and took her to Delhi. She claimed that she took the step to ensure better treatment in the national capital as her husband was a senior officer at the DRDO. She said, "I am shocked as the girl was not just a domestic help, but was like my daughter. Despite best efforts I could not save her life."The police wrapped up the investigation with statements from the minor’s father and the teacher. The investigation revealed the girl’s parents had sent her along with Kirti Singh to Kota for treatment and did not level any allegation, Borekheda police station SHO Mahendra Meena said.Meanwhile, Yogendra Singh, a neighbour Kirti Singh, submitted a report to the city superintendent of police (SP) demanding fair probe into the case on Saturday.Singh alleged that he heard screams of the minor from teacher’s house on Wednesday night while bhajans were being played on high volume.However, the police refuted the allegation of torture and said the minor died a natural death due to prolong illness.Kirti Singh said, "Nobody came to my rescue when I was taking her to hospital.

---||Mumbai||Governor’s suggestion will create new disputes: Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray||MUMBAI: After a delegation of BJP women activists met governor B S Koshyari to highlight crimes against women and suggested a special legislature session be convened, he wrote to CM Uddhav Thackeray, saying it would be appropriate if a two-day session were organised. Thackeray wrote in his four-page response that “at a juncture when the opposition is demanding a special session over the law and order situation, your decision to support the demand is threatening parliamentary democracy.” He added the governor’s suggestion would “create new disputes.” Referring to the “deteriorating” law-and-order situation in New Delhi and BJP-ruled states, Thackeray said, “Our government has taken steps to ensure that Sakinaka-type cases do not recur. In fact, atrocities against women and rape are a blot on society. In my opinion, such atrocities are a matter of national concern, so the matter should be discussed at the national level. In the recent past, even New Delhi has witnessed a sudden spurt in cases of atrocities against women. Law and order in New Delhi is a subject under the Central government.” Thackeray wrote that recently, a nine-year-old Dalit girl was gangraped and murdered in Delhi and to destroy evidence, the main accused and his accomplice performed the girl’s last rites. “It is quite shocking that the incident took place in the city which is the seat of the entire Central cabinet. A similar incident took place in BJP-ruled Bihar. A Member of Parliament raped his own colleague, and an offence was registered against him only after the intervention of the court. We must compare the swift action taken by my government and the situation in New Delhi and Bihar,” Thackeray stated in his letter. Quoting from the recent National Crime Records Bureau data, the CM wrote, “Uttar Pradesh has witnessed a massive spurt in atrocities against women, but so far no one has demanded a special session of the state legislature. The situation in Jammu and Kashmir is more or less similar, but so far there is no demand for a special session. In neighbouring Gujarat, as per the police report, 14 women are raped every day, and 2,908 women are missing from Ahmedabad,” Mentioning Uttarakhand, Koshyari’s home state, Thackeray wrote, “You have been leading Uttarakhand for a long period. I was told the state has witnessed a 150 per cent increase in cases of atrocities against women as per official data. Should we demand a special session in Uttarakhand?” Thackeray further stated, “After the Sakinaka rape and murder, my government has taken stringent measures to tackle atrocities against women. While the case has been fast-tracked, specific instructions have been given to the law-enforcing agencies to set up a Nirbhaya squad in each police station in the city. The state government is functioning as per provisions of law.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/governors-suggestion-will-create-new-disputes-in-mumbai-cm/articleshow/86412548.cms||---

After the government issued orders for construction of 52 foot overbridges in 2018, three foot overbridges were constructed under public-private partnership (PPP) but did not serve the purpose as they were set up in areas where there was very less or no pedestrian movement, officials said. Foot overbridges set up near Muffakham Jah College of Engineering and Technology on Road No. 2 of Banjara Hills and near Shilparamam at Madhapur are among the three foot overbridges which were set up under PPP model. Later, 36 foot overbridgeswere taken up in the first phase at an estimated cost of Rs 120 crore but most of them are not completely functional. “After conducting a survey of the areas where these foot overbridges are planned, it has been decided that about 10 foot overbridges will be completed by this year-end. Another 15 foot overbridges will be completed next year,” said M Devanand, GHMC chief engineer (maintenance). Infinity Mall near Chandanagar, ESI Hospital at Erragadda, NSKK at Balanagar, Neredmet crossroads, Central Mall at Panjagutta, GVK Mall at Banjara Hills, Swapna theatre at Katedhan, St Anns, Secunderabad, St Anns, Tarnaka and My Home Jewel at Miyapur are the 10 areas where the FOBs will be constructed by December. “Each of these foot overbridges is being constructed at an estimated cost of Rs 2.5 crore to Rs 3 crore. While all the foot overbridges have a lift, some of them will also have escalators,” said Devanand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ghmc-all-set-to-get-10-fobs-ready-by-end-of-december/articleshow/86408448.cms||Moulika.KV

The husband of the woman also alleged that after finding that she was not wearing any gold jewellery, the men attempted to kidnap her. The attackers escaped after they realized the presence of a police patrolling vehicle. Subina, 33, who suffered physical assault and also went through the mental trauma, was admitted to the MCH and was discharged on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the husband of the victim, Navas, alleged that though the officers in the police patrolling vehicle knew that a serious crime had taken place, they did not take any effort to chase the culprits or take his wife to the hospital. He also said that even on Monday morning a policeman from Thrikkunnappuzha station had rang him up and asked whether the victim could be brought to the station for recording her statement and also asked him whether they knew the attackers earlier. The incident happened just 2km away from her home. Meanwhile, the Thrikkunnappuzha CI said that police have registered a case for attempt for robbery and are examining the CCTV visuals in the region. He also said that the woman did not appear to have any injury and she was taken home by her brother who happened to come by that way at that time. He also said that in the complaint given by the husband there was no mention about the kidnap attempt. He said that the culprits seem to be youngsters and they were using a new-generation bike. “We are hoping to identify them from the CCTV visuals,” he added. Navas, a cancer patient, is an auto driver and Subina has been working in the MCH for six years now. She has been working in the Covid ward ever since the pandemic had broken out. The couple has two daughters. Navas said she had left for home after work on her scooter after 11.15pm. She was chased by the two men in a bike and when they came near her vehicle around 11.45pm and one of them hit on her head. The helmet she was wearing prevented an injury but she lost control of the vehicle and the scooter rammed an electric post and she fell on the road. One of them came and held her by the neck and asked her to give them all the gold jewellery. When it was found that she was not wearing any gold jewellery, she was dragged towards their bike. However, she managed to escape from their clutches and ran to the gate of a nearby house, he said. He also said that by this time the light of a police vehicle was visible and the attackers fled the scene. He also said that despite telling the police that the attackers escaped only a few moments earlier they did not bother to chase the vehicle down. They also said that they will investigate about the incident the next day. Navas later on went to Thrikkunnappuzha station and filed a case by 3am on Tuesday. Even after getting discharged, Subina is reeling under the trauma of the attack. Meanwhile, after taking a suo-motu cognisance on the attack on the woman health worker, the state human rights commission has asked the state police chief to file a detailed report within two weeks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/bike-borne-men-attack-nurse-in-alp/articleshow/86408525.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The two tahsildars had conducted the inquest of two accused, C Chennakeshavulu and Jollu Shiva, both allegedly minors.

The tahsildar said that both the cops were at a private hospital in Gachibowli during the video call. Ramesh said that ACP V Surender instructed him to write the names of the persons present at the time of exchange of fire in the inquest report.

The civic body even passed a circular at a house meeting to please traders. However, a month later, the traders say they are still waiting for relief, as increased rates are still charged online, in addition to late charges. Shopkeepers said that they were unlikely to get any relief unless the administrative wing formally approved the proposal. “Many traders in our market were keenly waiting for the announcement to roll back the rates, and after a lot of persuasion, the deliberative wing took action. But whenever we tried submitting the fees online for renewal of trade licenses, only the hiked rate chart was visible. On contacting, the officials gave the same excuse that changes will happen in two days, but the proposal was passed on August 11,” said Nitin Gupta, president of Kamla Nagar Traders Association. “The problem is that the penalty is increasing for the delay in renewal of trade license, which is why we are keen to deposit the fees on time,” said another trader. Leader of house Chhail Bihari Goswami said that they will highlight the issue in the House meeting on Wednesday and get the proposal notified soon. “We also heard issues faced by traders, and will ensure that it is notified soon,” he said. As per increased rates for obtaining trade and storage licenses, the fee was defined on the basis of area and location of premises or shop. For example—for granting and renewing trade licenses for business activity in the A and B category (defined based on property tax categorisation) that is spread over an area of 10 square metres, the proposed fee is Rs 3,450 instead of the present Rs 500 per year. The maximum fee amount can go up to Rs 57,500 per year in A and B category, in C and D, it will be Rs 46,000, and for E, F, G and H, it will be Rs 34,500. But after the strong resistance from traders, who suffered huge losses due to the Covid pandemic, the proposal was rolled back.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/17-fold-trade-fee-hike-rolled-back-only-on-paper/articleshow/86410808.cms||Vibha Sharma

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Kin of those who died of Covid but denied certificates can appeal to medical board||JAIPUR: People whose kin died of coronavirus but did not get death certificates declaring ‘Covid-19’ as the cause will have an opportunity to make corrections. The state government has constituted a four-member medical board for hearing disputes related to Covid deaths. Such boards have also been constituted at the district levels under district collectors. The state-level board will hear complainants whose applications were rejected at the district level. The actual number of Covid deaths may increase if the board decides in favour of the applicants. Corrections in death certificates declaring Covid as the cause will help kin of victims, especially widows and orphans, claim compensations announced by the state government during the pandemic. “The state-level board on Covid deaths will hear those complaints which are rejected at the district level,” said Dr Ajit Singh, member of the state-level board. The state-level board’s chairman will be Dr Raman Sharma, senior professor (medicine) from SMS Medical College, with members Dr Ravi Prakash Sharma, director AIDS control society as member, Dr Pravin Aswal, state nodal officer of integrated disease surveillance programme as coordinator and Dr Ajit Singh, superintendent RUHS Hospital. The boards at state and district levels have been constituted on the basis of guidelines issued by the Centre. Health department officials said there were some technical issues due to which certificates of Covid deaths were not issued to those patients whose RTPCR test showed negative result but HRCT showed Covid infection. While the government accepted Covid deaths of those who tested positive in RT-PCR., some of those who received Covid treatment on the basis of HRCT and died later are yet to be declared as Covid victims. Also, in some cases, doctors wrote cardiac failure, cardio-pulmonary failure, pneumonia etc as causes of deaths and these people also faced problems in getting Covid death certificates. According to the health department report, the number of deaths in the state due to Covid is 8,954, which may increase in case the district and state boards on Covid deaths decide in favour of the applicants. Dr Shalini Rathore, incharge Covid at Mahila Chikitsalaya in Jaipur said, “Those who died of Covid require Covid death certificate for claiming insurances. Those patients who died at our hospital and had tested positive by RT-PCR for Covid, we have issued them Covid death certificates.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/kin-of-those-who-died-of-covid-but-denied-certs-can-appeal-to-med-board/articleshow/86410743.cms||Syed Intishab Ali

---||Ahmedabad||‘Wouldn’t have come to Gujarat for studies’||Ahmedabad: The students of super-speciality courses in medicine on Tuesday told the Gujarat high court that had they known that they would have to furnish Rs 50 lakh bonds, they would never have come to Gujarat at all because they belong to the all-India quota. The court was hearing their pleas seeking directions to the state government to release the documents withheld by different medical institutes after the dispute over bond. More than 50 super-speciality students have approached the HC demanding immediate release of their documents, which have been retained by the medical institutes insisting that they should either submit bonds of Rs 50 lakh or serve the government for three years. Justice Bhargav Karia, who was hearing the case, told the state government that he has not come across any rule that empowers the government authorities to withhold the students’ documents. Appearing for the students, senior counsel Mihir Joshi submitted that the state government’s resolution regarding bond existed since 2014, but the government never asked for it. “Had we known about bond at the time of admission, we would have taken admission in other states because we are from All India Quota,” he submitted for the students. He added that there was no condition of submitting bond placed at the time of admission. The government has withdrawn this condition of the All India Quota for the undergraduate and postgraduate courses in medicine. The state government submitted that it has undertaken from 45 litigants that they would abide by the court’s order over submitting bonds. It also said that there is no other way for the university to compel the students to fulfil the condition and recover the money from them, and the government is not forcing them for tendering services in rural areas. The institutes would return documents as soon as the students give bonds. The judge said that the government can take any other recourse to recover money, but by withholding documents, it cannot jeopardize the careers of students of super speciality.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/wouldnt-have-come-to-gujarat-for-studies/articleshow/86408549.cms||---

---||Delhi||Covid Coughs Up New Problem: A Greater Vulnerability To TB?||New Delhi: Is low immunity and lung damage caused by Covid-19 predisposing some people to get tuberculosis? Many doctors are raising this concern as there has been a significant surge in diagnosis of the bacterial infection over the past few months. Dr Jugal Kishore, head of community medicine department at Safdarjung Hospital, said detection of TB has nearly doubled. “It’s possible that many patients who had TB are coming to hospitals now and getting tested, hence the increase in detection. But we cannot rule out the role of steroid use for Covid-19 management. It reduces immunity and predisposes those with latent infection to get active TB,” he added. According to World Health Organisation (WHO), 2-3 billion people in the world are latently infected with mycobacterium tuberculosis. It means the person has infection, but not the disease because his/her immune system is able to fight the bacteria to stop it from growing. WHO says 5%-15% of people suffering from latent TB are at risk of reactivation of TB. However, a recent study showed that for patients being treated with steroids, the risk of TB reactivation increased from 2.8 to 7.7-fold. “It’s recommended that all Covid patients who have recovered should be followed up for early detection and treatment of TB through DOTS centres. Otherwise, we may fail in the national tuberculosis elimination programme,” said Dr Kishore, who is also vice-president of Indian Association of Epidemiologists. AIIMS doctors said there was a significant increase in extrapulmonary TB cases, meaning the bacterial infection was affecting organs other than the lungs. Similar trends were observed in big private hospitals too. “Post Covid-19 second wave, we have 30%-40% detection of TB, many of them extrapulmonary,” said Dr Vikas Maurya, director and head of pulmonology department at Fortis Shalimar Bagh. He added that they had seen multiple members of the same family testing positive for TB. The increase in TB cases in the country was highlighted by public health experts in July too. The Union health ministry had then clarified that TB screening for all Covid-positive patients and Covid-19 screening for all diagnosed TB patients had been recommended. “States/UTs were asked for convergence for better surveillance and case finding of TB and Covid-19 as early as August 2020,” the health ministry stated. A statement issued by the ministry added, “Due to the impact of Covid-related restrictions, case notifications for TB decreased by about 25% in 2020. But special efforts are being made to mitigate this impact through intensified case finding in OPD settings as well as through campaigns by all states. Moreover, there is not enough evidence currently to suggest that there has been an increase in TB cases due to Covid-19.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/covid-coughs-up-new-problem-a-greater-vulnerability-to-tb/articleshow/86408541.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha
---||Pune||Pandemic, rise in energy costs boost solar power||Pune: Industry observers and experts have said the post-pandemic tightening of purse-strings by industries was driving a boom in rooftop and remote solar power systems. However, experts added that MSMEs, which constitute the vast majority of industries in the state and the country, should be incentivized to use solar power more. “Large companies can invest in a rooftop power plant or set up a plant remotely and feed that power into their grid. However, MSMEs often don’t have a lot of rooftop space, even though they are setting up solar power systems. Smaller companies can come together and set up plants remotely, but the authorities must also ease rules on open access,” said Prashant Girbane, director-general of the Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industry, and Agriculture (MCCIA). Last week, automaker Tata Motors announced a partnership with its sister concern Tata Power to set up a 3MW plant at its passenger vehicles factory in Chikhali. The partners in the project added it will generate 45 lakh kWh of power every year, reducing its carbon footprint by around 3,438 tonne per year. “In the past two to three months, we have seen enquiries shoot up by more than three times, and around 40% of the enquiries are coming from companies in Maharashtra,” Mayur Misra, chief executive officer of Corrit, a Gurgaon-based firm for solar power projects, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pandemic-rise-in-energy-costs-boost-solar-power/articleshow/86408532.cms||Shiladitya Pandit
---||Mumbai||Mumbai hits 1 crore-mark in Covid tests, majority RT-PCR||MUMBAI: Mumbai on Tuesday completed one crore tests to detect the novel Coronavirus, achieving one of the best testing rates for a city in India. Mumbai accounts for nearly one-fifth (17.5%) of all tests carried out in Maharashtra since the pandemic began in March 2020. The state has done 5.70 crore tests in all. BMC officials said the city has a testing rate of 7.15 lakh per million population; Delhi and Bengaluru are ahead of Mumbai though (see graphic). “We have crossed two milestones this month so far. Earlier in the month, we completed 1 crore vaccination doses and on Monday we crossed the 1 crore mark in corona tests,” said BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare. Delhi has carried out 2.68 crore tests in the same period, but BMC doctors maintain that the public health department has focused on targeted testing based on surveillance and used the gold standard RT-PCR test instead of randomly administering rapid antigen tests. Of the one crore tests done, 58.17lakh were RT-PCR and 42lakh antigen. “We manage between 35,000 to 40,000 tests a day at present, but we plan to increase our daily testing capacity gradually,” said BMC additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. Covid-19 testing in the city started on a low scale; less than 100 tests were being carried out at Kasturba Hospital in a day. Gradually, testing started at KEM Hospital, Haffkine Institute, National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health before private players were allowed to test. The city’s testing network has grown to 120 laboratories, including 82 private and 37 government or BMC-owned. In addition, BMC has 260 sites with walk-in facilities for free testing. “Mumbai now has capacity to carry out 1.7 lakh RT-PCR tests and 70,000 to 90,000 antigen tests every day,” said BMC’s Dr Pranita Tipre. While a lion share of the city’s tests are carried out at private laboratories, an official said it was because the BMC continued to outsource a bulk of their samples. BMC has tied up with private players that collect samples from peripheral hospitals, dispensaries, maternity homes and deliver the reports within 24 hours. Citizens, though, have often protested that the report is not conveyed through email or any digital medium and have to be collected physically. A new dimension is the at-home tests. Till August, over 18,000 self testing kits had been used in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hits-1-crore-mark-in-covid-tests-majority-rt-pcr/articleshow/86408695.cms||Malathy Iyer

This triggered the fears of degradation in the water among lake enthusiasts. On Monday, the fish deaths were attributed to the low cloud cover that led to a depletion in the oxygen content in the water due to the lack of sunlight.As the deaths persisted on Tuesday, environmental activists suspected that the poor quality of water was responsible for drastic reduction in dissolved oxygen at the lake. “I am horrified to see the fish floating dead on Tuesday. The water turned blackish,” said Somendra Mohan Ghosh, an environment activist and a lake-enthusiast.

---||India||Govt estimates record kharif output||NEW DELHI: Against the backdrop of improved monsoon rainfall and increased acreage of summer sown crops, the agriculture ministry on Tuesday estimated record output of kharif foodgrain, including paddy, and pegged its target for the entire 2021-22 crop year closer to the all-time high production figures of 2020-21. Though the estimates will be fine-tuned later, the first one for the current crop year on kharif crops estimates it to be around 150 million tonnes (MT) on better rice output of 107 MT which would also be a new record. Overall, for both kharif and rabi put together, it set the target of 307 MT of foodgrain for the current crop year which is merely a million tonne less than the record output in the previous year. The kharif acreage, specifically that of paddy and pulses, has already recovered thanks to the good rains in September, specifically in areas which suffered large deficits in July and August. The ministry released its 2021-22 target and first estimate for the current year at the national conference, chaired by agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar, on rabi crops. The objective of the conference was to review and assess the crop performance during the preceding crop season and fix crop-wise targets for rabi season in consultation with state governments whose representatives attended the meet. Addressing the conference, Tomar said the Centre was fully committed to support states to increase production and productivity and to face the challenges posed by climate change and rainfed agriculture. He urged states to use water, electricity and fertilisers judiciously and to use Nano-urea which is less costly and beneficial for land fertility. “Idea was to discuss how to ensure supply of critical inputs and facilitate adoption of innovative technologies with a view to enhance production and productivity of the crops with focus to increase production of oilseeds and pulses. Special campaign will be launched to increase production of oilseeds in Rabi season with focus on mustard, sunflower and oil palm,” said an official. Special campaign for mustard will be launched in 11 major rapeseed and mustard growing states. It was decided that only new varieties having yield potential with more than 20 quintal per hectare will be distributed as seed mini-kits to popularise new varieties and increase productivity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-estimates-record-kharif-output/articleshow/86414194.cms||Vishwa Mohan
---||Kochi||Regular cruise services to begin today||Kochi: Giving a major push to the tourism and other commercial sectors in Kochi, the tourism department and a private cruise vessel company is starting regular domestic cruise services to the city. The private cruise company will operate vessels in Mumbai-Kochi-Lakshadweep sector twice a month for the next one year while the tourism department will take steps to tap its tourism potential. Luxury liner ‘MV Empress’, owned by Cordelia Cruises, with 1,200 travellers will anchor at the Cochin Port on Wednesday. “Cordelia Cruises has scheduled their voyage for the next 12 months and their vessels will call at Kochi twice a month. If the passenger turnout is good, they plan to schedule weekly services connecting Mumbai-Kochi-Lakshadweep sector,” said deputy director of tourism department Abhilash Kumar T G. “The major advantage of the domestic cruise service is that at least a section of passengers would disembark in Kochi and visit various tourist destinations in Kochi and other parts of the state. Around 200 passengers who arrive by MV Empress will not rejoin when the vessel leaves for Lakshadweep on Wednesday afternoon. Some of them will be returning when another cruise liner of the same company calls at Kochi, while the remaining batch would go to their destinations on their own after visiting various tourism spots in the state,” Kumar said. “We are taking all the possible measures to attract more such vessels to Kochi,” he said. According to the agencies associated with cruise tourism, around 800 passengers from Kerala will embark the ship when it leaves for Lakshadweep on Wednesday evening. Those from Kozhikode and Malappuram districts constitute a major chunk of the passengers who are to board the vessel from Kochi. “Starting cruise services is a welcome move. It will have a cascading impact on all the sectors in Kochi and the state. The most important factor is that around 800 passengers are embarking from Kochi. This will open up the possibilities of starting home porting services (vessels docking and originating from Kochi) from Kochi in the near future,” an official with Cochin Port said. “It was in February that Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the modern cruise terminal at Cochin Port. We already have another cruise terminal. So, there won’t be any difficulties in starting cruise vessels originating from Kochi,” he said. Around 150 tourists disembarking in Kochi will be taken to various tourist destinations in Fort Kochi, Mattancherry and Marine Drive before boarding the vessel. “It is the maiden voyage of the ship. So, we have to arrange everything in such a manner that the vessel can return in the afternoon. In the near future, an elaborate plan by incorporating other destinations can also be prepared,” said Sanjeev Kumar, CEO of Voyages Kerala, the tour agent of the Kochi sight-seeing of the trip. “Then, we may be able to provide a houseboat cruise for them as well,” Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/regular-cruise-services-to-begin-today/articleshow/86406397.cms||M K Sunil Kumar
---||Kolkata||UK holiday plans fall flat for Kol families jabbed with Covishield||Kolkata: Families in Kolkata, who had plans to visit relatives and friends in the UK during the Puja vacation, are extremely disappointed over the Boris Johnson government’s decision not to recognise Covishield Covid-19 vaccine that is administered in India, though it is the same as the AstraZeneca vaccine given in the UK. The travel trade community, too, is bewildered at the discriminatory attitude and says that it will not only discourage Indians from travelling to the UK during the Durga Puja and Christmas holidays but also adversely impact the sustainability of the direct Kolkata-London weekly flight operated by Air India. Public relations executive Nabamita Adhikari, who is all set to travel to London on October 10 with her children Aaradhya and Aaditri, is absolutely distraught. “We have booked tickets for the Disney’s hit West End musical Aladdin at London’s Hammersmith. But now, despite being vaccinated, we have to stay in home quarantine for 10 days. This is ridiculous,” fumed Adhikari. Retired bank executive Tapan Roy, who was planning a trip to London to visit his sons Somak and Subhayu, is also bewildered with the decision of the UK government. He has questioned how the UK can deny recognition to a vaccine that is approved by the World Health Organisation. “This smacks of a racist approach towards a developing nation. For anyone travelling to the UK for a couple of weeks, getting quarantined for 10 days does not make any sense,” he said. Travel Agents Federation of India chairman (east) Anil Punjabi is planning to submit a memorandum to the British Deputy High Commission in Kolkata, demanding a change in the policy. “There are so many Kolkatans, who have relatives and friends in the UK. The VFR traffic is huge. Everything will be jeopardised by this. Even the future of the Air India London-Kolkata flight now hangs in balance,” he said. Travel Agent Association of India chairman (east) Manav Soni feels that the UK government can at least waive the quarantine requirement after a Covid test on arrival. “Once the report is negative, a traveller should be allowed to exit the quarantine,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/uk-holiday-plans-fall-flat-for-kol-families-jabbed-with-covishield/articleshow/86408618.cms||Subhro Niyogi

---||Pune||MahaMetro now focuses on precautionary pocket tracks||Pune: The Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited (MahaMetro) has shifted its focus to expediting construction of pocket tracks in parts of the two corridors coming up in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad. A pocket track serves the same purpose as the shoulder lane of a high-speed expressway — it is used in the event of a mechanical failure or breakdown of a Metro rake. One such pocket track is coming up on the Vanaz-Ramwadi corridor — just ahead of the Regional Transport Office (RTO) Chowk towards Pune railway station — parallel to the main viaduct. Another track is coming up at the College of Agriculture depot. These tracks are being constructed in addition to the stabling lines coming up on both ends of each corridor, which will be used for the rakes’ maintenance. “Pocket tracks are usually constructed as a precautionary measure — if a rake on the main track faces a mechanical or technical snag, it can be moved to the pocket track for repairs so that main line remains clear,” a MahaMetro official said. The official said both corridors — fully elevated Vanaz-Ramwadi and elevated-underground PCMC-Swargate — will have this facility. “The pocket track near RTO Chowk has been aligned and we have started launching girders to lay the tracks. A special arch-like beam structure has been installed to support this pocket track in this stretch, which comes on the Vanaz-Ramwadi route,” the official explained. Hemant Sonawane, general manager (public relations) at MahaMetro, said all necessary steps were being taken to ensure smooth operation of rakes, and their parking and basic maintenance. “The stabling lines are coming up at PCMC, Vanaz, Swargate and Ramwadi. All the work is at an advanced stage; we are now pushing to expedite the remainder. The facilities will be utilized for maintenance, repairs and basic checks of rakes,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mahametro-now-focuses-on-precautionary-pocket-tracks/articleshow/86408607.cms||Sarang Dastane

---||Nagpur||Demand for booster dose growing amongst medicos||Nagpur: The demand for the third dose of Covid-19 vaccine is now getting strong amongst the healthcare workers in Vidarbha. Many of them will complete six month period after their second dose by September-end and early October. As many countries like UK have already started administering the third dose to healthcare workers; doctors in Nagpur are also keen to get the jab to maintain the antibody level. “There is no harm in taking a booster dose. The problem is limited supply and a lot of people still have not received the second dose,” said infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde. “I think third dose is the only way we would be able to defend better against the Delta variant. Now onwards, delta will dominate the world. Initially, third dose can be offered to those who haven’t developed natural infection,” he added. Dr Shinde said that UK will offer third dose of Covid vaccine from September 2021 to adults above 16 years who are immunosuppressed; people living in residential care homes, all adults above 70 yrs of age, all frontline and health care workers, and all those who are clinically extremely vulnerable. Experts told TOI that the demand for the third dose will come from the other sections of society in next two months. Front line workers, senior citizens will also complete six months post second dose by December this year. Many of them may ask for the third dose for safety. “The government should form a policy to deal with the demand of booster dose which is going to escalate in future. It may make the third dose voluntary or paid for those who need it. But, we can’t ignore this demand anymore,” said Dr Ramakant Patil from Akola. An important trial of mix-and-match of Covaxin’s nasal vaccine and injectable vaccine is under way in Vidarbha which can be a game changer. Experts said that a nasal vaccine after six months of second jab can offer a good protection. “Nasal vaccines create local antibodies. Virus is neutralized before it enters the body. In this way, they can stop all breakthrough infections. Hence, we must expedite this process,” said Dr Nitin Shinde. Vaccination is going on in full swing across the country and in Vidarbha too. Government sources said that they are still some pockets in Vidarbha where vaccination is yet to achieve the expected coverage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/demand-for-booster-dose-growing-amongst-medicos/articleshow/86408648.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Ahmedabad||Ford adieu: Give government jobs if needed, says Jignesh Mevani||AHMEDABAD: The independent MLA from Vadgam, Jignesh Mevani, pushed for government jobs for workers currently employed at the passenger car manufacturing plant of Ford India Limited in Sanand. Mevani met the representatives of Karnavati Kamdar Ekta Sangh (KKES), a union of about 850 workers employed at the American automobile giant’s Sanand facility. Ford Motor Company recently announced its exit from its India operations and will shut down the car manufacturing plant by December 2021. “Thousands of workers will be left jobless after the plant shuts down and this comes at a time when unemployment is at its peak,” Mevani told TOI. “The company must ensure that all workers get jobs. If the plant is sold off to another private player, the incoming company must absorb all employees at the same salary and benefits.” A Ford India spokesperson said, “We remain committed to working with the unions and other stakeholders on measures to help balance the impact and care for those directly affected by the restructuring. We have started discussion with the union.” According to Ford India Limited, about 1,600 persons are employed at the Sanand facility. “The state government must step in and help workers get government jobs if private jobs cannot be ensured,” Mevani said. “When inflation is rising, the survival of several families will be at stake.” Mevani added: “This is also a reflection of weak labour laws in Gujarat where even minimum wages are not ensured for workers.” In the past, KKES has made representations to the state government seeking employment and job security. “Survival of all the workers and their families will be at stake if workers lose their jobs. We’ve made representations about the issue to the labour commissioner at Khanpur, Ahmedabad, in addition to the state labour department,” said Anil Zala, vice president, KKES. “We have also sent an email to the chief minister. However, we are yet to get any response.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ford-adieu-give-government-jobs-if-needed-says-mevani/articleshow/86408660.cms||Niyati Parikh

Fishermen are reeling under severe crisis with lockdown, fuel price hike, weather warnings and poor landings. While traditional boats could go fishing for nearly 130 days this year from January, the larger boats have only started going since August. Unlike in other districts, Kochi has been strictly following the alternate day principle for larger boats to ensure sustainability and a fair catch for all. The Kerala sardines are still missing at the landings. Several fishermen said that they have been getting juveniles in their nets. Officials said that while they could sympathize with the fishing community, they have been booking cases against landings which are below the fixed minimum legal size (MLS). “We know that some of our counterparts are catching and selling it in other states’ harbours. Much of the catch is going to the fishmeal industry,” said a fisherman. “Fuel prices of both diesel and kerosene have also affected the entire sector, especially the traditional sector. The only good news in all these days is that we are getting better prices when compared to earlier days,” said Anthony Kurishinkal, a fisherman at Chellanam. Most boat owners say that they cannot afford 10 to 15-day fishing operations. “We will need at least 3,000 litres of diesel, food and ration for 20 plus workers, wages etc. Even if we set off, we have no guarantee of a good catch. All we are getting is marine shrimps,” said P P Gireesh of trawl net boat operators’ association. “For the last few days, there have been better landings. Many systems have to be put in place before implementing the auctioning system, which has been affected due to Covid. Right now, high-value fishes for export are being sold at fair prices for fishermen,” said fisheries joint director Saju M S. The government should have discussions with them before implementing the auction and management bill, said Charle George, state president of Kerala matsya thozhilali union.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/fisheries-sector-reeling-under-severe-crisis/articleshow/86406409.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

PMRDA officials said the land acquisition process was nearly complete for the corridor and that the Pune Municipal Corporation has given an in-principle approval to the University flyover plan, clearing the decks for the project’s concessionaire — Tata-Siemens — to begin the project. “The project will have to be completed in three years and four months from the commencement date,” a PMRDA official said. Once the commencement date is announced, work will begin simultaneously at eight locations along the 23.3km route, officials said. An official close to the development said pre-engineering work and geotechnical investigation have been completed, while 70% of the work sites have been barricaded; soil testing, structural design and work at the casting yard too has begun. The corridor will connect Mann, near the Hinjewadi IT park, to Civil Court in Shivajinagar. Officials said it would take 40 minutes to complete end-to-end commute on the route, which will comprise 23 stations. The concessionaire will execute the project on a design, build, finance, operate and transfer basis for an initial concession period of 35 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmrdas-project-start-date-announcement-this-week/articleshow/86408645.cms||Nisha Nambiar

---||Ahmedabad||Dengue cases in Ahmedabad quadruple this year||AHMEDABAD: Blame it on the erratic monsoon this year, or reduced immunity after the second wave of Covid-19, but Amdavadis are falling prey to the vector-borne diseases. The data from Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) revealed that the cases have quadrupled compared to 2020. In 2020, there were 432 dengue cases in the city and 923 chikungunya cases. From January 1 to September 18 this year, the city has recorded 1,125 dengue cases and 592 chikungunya cases. For the same period last year, the numbers were 255 and 196 respectively. Dengue cases rose four-fold, whereas chikungunya cases rose two-fold, revealed the analysis. “A total of 436 malaria cases were registered in the same period last year, which rose to 627 this year. The city reported 618 malaria cases in all of 2020. There were 35 falciparum cases in the Jan-Sept period last year, which rose to 53 this year,” said an AMC health department official. The number of cases of waterborne diseases also increased in this period, AMC figures show. In all, 1,464 cases of typhoid registered in the January to September period this year, against 965 cases last year. “We have carried out indoor spraying at 1,76,358 residential and 6,808 non-residential units,” said the official. The city-based hospitals and clinics share the similar experience. Dr Rajnish Patel, additional medical superintendent of Civil Hospital, said that the hospital has witnessed about 128 cases of vector-borne diseases in September, which is about 30% higher compared to August. “The severity of the cases is higher compared to the last year,” Dr Patel said. General practitioners said that this year, the rise is primarily seen in chikungunya compared to dengue. Viral fever is also observed in several patients. “Severe drop in platelets is one of the tell-tale signs of dengue. If the patient comes with more than one day of fever and body pain, we suggest them tests for both dengue and chikungunya,” said a city-based physician. The experts advised citizens to be on guard for at least a fortnight as the new spell of rains may further increase mosquito density in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/dengue-cases-in-city-quadruple-this-year/articleshow/86410992.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Telangana HC stays auction of 11 acres at Puppalaguda||HYDERABAD: Making it clear that the state cannot auction a piece of land over which it has no title, the Telangana high court on Tuesday stayed the ensuing auction of a 11-acre plot at Puppalaguda village in Gandipet mandal of Rangareddy district. TSIIC has prepared a schedule for the auction of 95 acres, including the 11-acre land parcel located in survey number 301, at Puppalaguda on September 28. P Nanda Kumar of Lakshmi Engineering and Constructions Company had filed a petition challenging the inclusion of their 11-acre land in the auction. A bench of Acting Chief Justice M S Ramachandra Rao and Justice T Vinod Kumar heard the plea and stayed the auction in respect of the plots that fall under survey number 301. State counsel Harender Pershad said the plots scheduled for auction fall within 302 and 303 survey numbers also. The bench wondered as to how a single plot in a village spreads across several survey numbers. “Do not rely on the jugglery of numbers. You are playing a mischievous game,” the bench warned the state counsel, while issuing notices to the state, industries department, TSIIC and HMDA. Appearing for the petitioner, senior counsel Yamarthi Chandrasekhar informed the court that they had purchased the parcel of land in 2006 from the legal heirs of Navalmal Rizwani, a refugee who left his Sindh residence in Pakistan during the Partition and settled in Hyderabad. The central government had brought in the Displaced Persons (Compensation & Rehabilitation) Act, 1954, to allot alternative properties to such people in lieu of the properties they had left behind at the time of leaving their previous place of residence. The properties of those who left for Pakistan from Hyderabad at the time of the Partition were kept aside to compensate the incoming refugees. The Centre had created a compensation land pool for meeting the needs of refugees. After verifying the claim made by Rizwani, the Centre had through its regional settlement commissioner at Bombay (now Mumbai) and deputy custodian at Hyderabad allotted 41 acres of land in survey number 301 of Puppalaguda in Rangareddy district. “The property we bought from the legal heirs of Rizwani was part of this land. The President had granted Sanad (an ordinance-like document conveying title) to Rizwani and it was also registered in August 1955. The state is now trying to transfer the title of our land to TSIIC in an illegal way,” Chandrasekhar said. The bench questioned the state counsel as to how the state was proceeding further without any title in its favour. The regional settlement commissioner, representing the President under the Act, conveyed the title in this case. It appears prima facie state has no case. “How can a custodian of the land claim title over the land?” the bench asked. A Satyasiri, the advocate on record, pointed out that while the state has authorised TSIIC to auction 40 acres of land at Puppalaguda, it was now proposing to auction 95 acres, contrary to the state’s authorisation. Expressing doubts over the statement of the state’s special counsel Harender Pershad that their land was in a different survey number, the bench said that the petitioner’s land in survey number 301 covers plots 25, 26, 28, 29 and 30 of the TSIIC auction notification. It stayed the auction of these plots and adjourned the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-stays-auction-of-11-acres-at-puppalaguda/articleshow/86412612.cms||---

The court said it has repeatedly brought the delay to the notice of the CID, and for no fault of victims, trial in the 12-year-old case is getting delayed. No one appeared for the state on Tuesday. On the last date, too, the court had come down on the state CID for the delay in the 2003 custodial death case trial. Dismissed API Sachin Waze is one of the accused. He was not produced as he is hospitalized following a heart bypass surgery at Wockhardt Hospital in Mumbai, his lawyers Raunak Naik and Sudeep Pasbola informed the court. The trial has been stalled since 2018 after special public prosecutor Dhiraj Mirajkar was abruptly removed; no appointment was made since. A software engineer, Yunus was arrested in the 2002 Ghatkopar BEST bus blast case. Waze and his team had claimed that Yunus had escaped. But in 2017, an acquitted co-accused, a doctor who teaches forensics in a medical college, told the court he had seen Yunus being brutally assaulted in custody and vomiting blood on January 6, 2003. On Tuesday, the court noted Waze was on bail in this case but in judicial custody in another. Two other accused, on bail, were present. One was on bail, but sought exemption from personal appearance. Chief public prosecutor J V Desai said a proposal for appointment of a special public prosecutor was “under process before the law and judiciary department, government of Maharashtra’’. The file was approved by the additional chief secretary (home) and is now pending before the law and judiciary department. Irfan Shaikh, deputy superintendent of police, state CID submitted the process for appointment of an SPP was on and that the progress report would be submitted by the next date, “without fail”. The court said, “The record reveals that despite repeated notices and letters to the police officers as well as the prosecution, there is no concrete process...Still considering the assurance by state CID/ chief PP, the matter is adjourned till the next date.’’ Advocate Chetan Mali for original complainant, Yunus’ mother Asiya Begum, was present and submitted that a special leave petition is pending before Supreme Court challenging non grant of prior sanction to prosecute and a petition is pending before Bombay high court on removal of SPP Mirajkar. The HC petition is scheduled for hearing on Wednesday, said Mali. The court directed him to file a status report on the petition before HC and the SLP while adjourning proceedings to October 20.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-no-spl-prosecutor-yet-in-khwaja-yunus-case/articleshow/86412623.cms||Swati Deshpande

For the second time in a row, NU administration failed to appoint a dean for its interdisciplinary studies faculty. According to NU officials, the interviews for both posts were conducted on Saturday. In the absence of vice chancellor Subhash Chaudhari, who is on leave, pro-VC Sanjay Dudhe headed the interview panel. The panel interviewed 16 candidates, who were told to come with a presentation on their vision and mission to develop the university. After the interviews, Vijay Khandal, working as librarian at Datta Meghe Institute of Medical Sciences (DMIMS), was appointed on Monday. It was, however, opposed by other candidates. As far as appointment of interdisciplinary studies dean was concerned, the university again did not find any suitable candidate for the post. It means ad-hoc dean Rajashree Vaishnav would continue to be at the helm of affairs until the next interview process. “Only three candidates appeared for the dean’s interview. None of them were found to be suitable by our panel,” Dudhe told TOI. He informed that the last interview for the same post in August second week was cancelled as the expert panel for conducting those could not be constituted in time. After the Knowledge Resource Centre director’s interviews, many candidates complained they were not allowed sufficient time for showing their presentation, while “some favourites” were granted more time. The pro-VC however denied the allegations, clarifying that they started the process at 11am and finished at 5.30pm. “We, of course, granted more time to candidates whose presentations were found to be innovative and impressive. But it was wrong to say that we had not offered an opportunity to remaining candidates. If we had granted one hour to each of them, it would have taken two days to finish the process,” he said. NU officials however told TOI that the director’s appointment was already fixed as he was not only a qualified and highly experienced candidate, but also had support from the political outfits in the university. According to them, for all appointments in NU, the candidates are already fixed, and the interview process is conducted as a “mere formality”.

---||Hyderabad||State told to heighten dengue vigil amid more severe serotype-2 cases||Hyderabad: Doctors have advised people to exercise caution in the wake of the Centre’s recent alert to Telangana and Andhra Pradesh over the occurrence of the serotype-2 dengue cases. According to World Health Organization (WHO) data, there are four varieties of dengue — serotypes 1 to 4 at play. Every year, around 40 million people get infected with dengue all over the world. The prevalence of serotype-2 has been growing over the previous decade. “The occurrence of serotype-2 is presently at 35%. This is more severe than other varieties of dengue fever,” said Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) certified researcher Dr Kiran Madala. In serotype-2 dengue infections, platelets drop rapidly and the body’s immune response is hyperactive, resulting in a cytokine storm which can damage the organs. This variant of dengue also impacts the kidneys. “The chances of dengue mortality may be higher in serotype-2 cases than in other types, albeit the total mortality rate in dengue is less than 1%,” Dr Kiran explained. The types of dengue are distinguished by the variety of protein delivered by the disease-causing virus. Each serotype includes five subtypes. Dengue virus spreads through the bite of an infected aedes mosquito and produces a wide range of illnesses ranging from mild asymptomatic disease to fatal dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS). So far, Telangana has not officially registered any dengue deaths. Though the Centre has issued a warning about the increased number of cases among children, officials say this is due to cases in states such as UP and Bihar, and there is no outbreak among children in Telangana. While active surveillance is being undertaken in the state, officials say that people must make sure that there is no larva breeding in their homes and no water retention areas. Interestingly, each individual can be infected by a dengue-causing virus four times in their lifetime. According to current WHO estimates, one in every five people worldwide can become infected during the peak of the season in a year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/state-told-to-heighten-dengue-vigil-amid-more-severe-serotype-2-cases/articleshow/86408760.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Hyderabad||Amid climate change, farmers slipping out of insurance cover||HYDERABAD: At a time when the effects of climate change are becoming more pronounced than ever, a higher number of farmers, who constitute one of the high-risk categories find themselves left without crop insurance cover. Lack of availability of covers that meet farmers’ unique requirements coupled with existing lacunas in the country’s flagship crop insurance scheme -- Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna (PMFBY) -- are leaving farmers exposed to the vagaries of nature. As per industry estimates, around 30-40% of farmers take crop insurance every year and around 90% of the industry premium comes under the PMFBY. In PMFBY, which was introduced in 2016, farmers have to pay a premium ranging between 1.5%-2% with the remaining premium shared between state and Centre. When this scheme was launched, it was a mandatory cover for loanee farmers and optional for non-loanee farmers. In the latest guidelines, PMFBY cover has been made optional for all farmers. Currently, 58% farmers are loanees. Saurabh Bhalerao, associate director & head, BFSI research, CARE Ratings, pointed out that gross premium underwritten by general insurers in crop insurance has reduced by 12.4% in the four-month period ended July 2021 to Rs 4,221.3 crore as compared to Rs 4,817 crore in the corresponding period of last year. “As anecdotal data suggests, as the crop insurance scheme has been made optional, farmer enrolment has reduced. Another reason that can be attributed to lower crop insurance is reportedly the mismatch between digital records and land ownership claims made by the concerned farmers as this mismatch prevents farmers from availing crop insurance,” he said. In fact, Punjab never implemented PMFBY whereas Bihar and West Bengal withdrew in 2018 and 2019 respectively. Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Jharkhand have also not implemented the scheme in 2020. In the last monsoon session, a parliamentary panel had submitted a report stating that the financial constraints of the state governments and low claim ratio during normal seasons are the major reasons for non-implementation of PMFBY by these states. “While some states have come up with their own crop insurance schemes or have rolled out assistance programmes, some of the states that paid a premium for two or three crop cycles and did not face any calamity … withdrew from PMFBY. This is short sightedness,” an official of a public insurance company said. CA Srinivasan, vice-president, speciality business, Alliance Insurance Brokers, pointed out that when PMFBY was launched, the aim was to bring at least 80% of the cultivable area under crop insurance but in the last few years, the coverage has shrunk. “Often because of the delay in the release of funds, the insurers would not get premium on time…This inordinate delay in remittance of premium and claim settlement has led to farmers having apprehensions about continuing with the scheme,” he said. Srinivasan added that even private insurers have started dropping out of PMFBY because of delays in release of premium subsidy by the state and central governments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/amid-climate-change-farmers-slipping-out-of-insurance-cover/articleshow/86412620.cms||Swati Rathor

The merit list will probably be the last for this year’s admissions on Wednesday. Joint deputy director of education, Pune region, Meena Shendkar said, “This special round is conducted for students who have not been allotted any college in the first three rounds. After the merit list is announced, it will be mandatory for them to take admissions.” New entrants to the CAP process have also registered for this round. This year, the number of FYJC registrations has reduced and yet at the end of three rounds, 70,000 seats still remain vacant. In the first three rounds, only 43,074 students confirmed their admissions, the lowest in the past two to three years. The students registered for the special round between September 17 and 20 and on Wednesday, the merit list will be announced at 10am. Admissions under various quotas such as minority, management and in-house quota will take place parallel to CAP. “We will see the response to these rounds and decide whether we need to conduct one more such round based on the number of applications, number of allotments and the vacancy. Once that ends, we will start with the first-come-first-serve (FCFS) round. A detailed schedule will be sent in time,” Shendkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cap-panel-to-put-out-special-round-merit-list-today/articleshow/86408771.cms||---
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Teachers plan to mail postcards on reopening primary schools to CM Uddhav Thackeray||PUNE: Maharashtra State Primary Teachers Committee (MSPTC) has decided to start a postcard campaign urging the state government to reopen schools for students from Std I to VII. The committee has told students, parents and teachers to send postcards to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray urging him to reopen the primary schools. Teachers in rural India have said the school closure is affecting students in primary classes the most as many are first-generation learners and due to no support of family during online classes, they do not even know how to read or write the alphabet. “As of now, malls, bazaars and tourist places everything has opened for the public and children are also seen in the crowd but schools are still closed. Students are suffering due to a lack of physical school reopening. It is important to reopen schools for the students’ mental, emotional and social well-being. We have requested people to ensure that the postcards are not derogatory as our aim is to urge the CM to take a positive stand in reopening primary schools. We have urged teachers to buy the postcards and distribute them among parents and students,” Vijay Kombe, general secretary of the committee, said. A teacher from ZP school in Khed taluka said the students who are in Std II this year are completely blank. “When they joined in Std I, the pandemic had started and hence there was no school.,Now, they are in Std II where they are supposed to learn tougher things. But, when these students cannot even recognise numbers or letters, then how can we teach them words, sentences or basic mathematics. When they enrol in Std I, we hold their hands and make them write. But now they have no clue. The same is the case with the students who have joined the Std I now. There is a need to immediately reopen school or we are failing our children in their basic right to education,” the teacher said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/teachers-plan-to-mail-postcards-on-reopening-primary-schools-to-cm/articleshow/86408736.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: LH Hiranandani hospital writes to govt seeking booster shot for health staff||MUMBAI: Powai’s LH Hiranandani Hospital is the first in the city to write to the corporation and state demanding booster shots for healthcare workers. TOI reported last week how several healthcare workers and politicians were skirting Co-Win to take the third shot, fearing a depletion in their antibody levels. A third booster shot against Covid-19 has not been allowed by the Centre yet. The policy instead emphasises on universal vaccination of citizens. However, some western countries have approved a booster shot for those immunocompromised and for healthcare workers. “It’s almost six months since health staff took a second jab. In over 80% of health workers, by now the efficacy of vaccine taken has reduced considerably and among many it has become nil as on today,” said Dr Sujit Chatterjee, CEO of LH Hiranandani. He added that while the Centre’s policyis understandable and even logical, those on the frontlines must be protected. “The booster jab can be restricted only to health workers, which is a tiny portion of the total population,” he said. Hospital heads support the idea of a third shot but have decided to wait for a decision from the Centre. The issue of taking booster shots was also discussed by the Association of Hospitals (AOH). Dr V Ravishankar, COO of Lilavati Hospital, said the AOH won’t approach the government for booster shots at the moment. “The need for a third shot is still being studied. Healthcare workers are measuring antibody levels but there is also something called cell-mediated immunity that must be considered. Most countries have recommended a third shot mainly for those with immune deficiencies,” he said, adding that hospitals are watching the emerging evidence closely. The head of a private hospital said several have taken the third shot after measuring their antibodies. Israel’s experience—where despite 78% of the population over 12 years being vaccinated, the country reported high infection rates—has given rise to concerns about breakthrough infections. Closer home, Dr Hemant Deshmukh, dean of KEM Hospital said breakthrough infections among health workers are being reported, but they are a handful.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hiranandani-hospital-writes-to-govt-seeking-booster-shot-for-health-staff/articleshow/86408770.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: As Michael Lobo dithers, BJP rushes Devendra Fadnavis to keep him on board||PANAJI: With an eye on securing as many seats as possible in Bardez, BJP’s election in-charge for Goa, Devendra Fadnavis, met ports minister and Calangute MLA Michael Lobo at his residence on Tuesday. The former Maharashtra chief minister was accompanied by state party president Sadanand Shet Tanavade, and the meeting went on for nearly an hour. Fadnavis brushed aside speculations of Lobo being upset following a meeting with the Calangute MLA and his wife, Parra sarpanch Delilah (R). He said that speaking in the interest of the party does not mean the person is upsetPolitical observers say that the meeting was aimed at pacifying Lobo, who is yet to be given the responsibility to take major decisions for the taluka, a job he has been coveting. The Calangute MLA said that he has informed Fadnavis that his wife Delilah, who is Parra sarpanch, would contest from Siolim constituency. The Calangute MLA has been working in the neighbouring constituency for quite a while now. While Lobo said that “Fadnavis did not react positively or negatively”, Fadnavis said that “the party would take the right decision at the right time”. Fadnavis’ visit to discuss the situation in Bardez has triggered speculations among political circles in the backdrop of questions raised over Lobo continuing with BJP. A political observer said that if Lobo quits BJP, the party has reduced chances of winning maximum seats in Bardez, as the Calangute MLA wields influence in most of the seven constituencies, including Mapusa, Saligao, Siolim, Porvorim and Calangute. In 2016, when Lobo was unhappy, former chief minister Manohar Parrikar had visited his house to pacify him and to convince him to continue in BJP. “It is important for BJP to win at least six out of the seven constituencies in Bardez to form the government, and if Lobo is not with the party, it will be a difficult task for BJP,” a political observer said. Lobo had recently announced that Congress and AAP have approached him to join their parties. He had said that Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal had sought to meet him, but that till date, he had not given him an appointment. “There is nothing wrong with talking. It is up to that particular individual, MLA or minister, to take a decision in the interest of the people of the state,” he had said.  For the zilla panchayat elections held last year, Lobo had shown his strength by winning the Socorro ZP seat and defeating Porvorim independent MLA Rohan Khaunte’s candidate. He was also instrumental in giving BJP control of Socorro panchayat, which was seen as a setback for Khaunte. A senior BJP functionary said that Lobo wants to play an important role in selecting candidates for Bardez. At one point, BJP had entrusted Lobo with the task of expanding the party’s base in the taluka, but had asked him to stop when they realised that he was trying to make personal inroads. Lobo has told the party that new faces should be given a chance in the 2022 assembly elections, or the party will see the results of the 2017 assembly polls repeated in 2022. In the run up to the 2017 polls, Lobo had similarly demanded that some candidates be changed. Fadnavis said that the meeting was to understand the ground situation before taking a decision. “There is a good situation in Goa for BJP to form the government, and we need to fine tune (issues) after understanding the ground situation,” he said. When asked if Lobo told him about his being upset with senior party leaders, Fadnavis said that there is no question of anyone being upset and “if someone speaks in the interest of the party, that does not mean the person is upset”. “We have raised the issue of the people of Goa. We have to express the people’s feelings to the government of the day,” Fadnavis said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/as-lobo-dithers-bjp-rushes-fadnavis-to-keep-him-on-board/articleshow/86410928.cms||---
---||Navi-mumbai||Maharashtra has just 10 days of blood stock, to rev up donor camps||PUNE: The State Blood Transfusion Council has stated that Maharashtra is left with blood stock that can last up to 10 days and has requested collectors and commissioners to help organize camps and mobilize donors to replenish the depleting reserve. A council official said it had around 40,000 blood units in the 350 blood banks across the state. “This can last for 8-10 days as against the usual buffer of 15-20 days,” the official said. The council has attributed the situation to the decline in blood donation camps, lower footfall of donors due to the pandemic and social organizations’ failure to organize such events amid Covid-induced restrictions. The council has requested collectors and commissioners to help the public health department organize blood donation camps in adherence to the Covid protocols. “More blood donation camps with the local authorities’ help will replenish the depleting stock in the blood banks of the state. We need to have such camps frequently and not just once,” said State Blood Transfusion Council assistant director Dr Arun Thorat. Blood donation camps that were announced earlier had witnessed a huge response. “Response to the camps held recently was relatively low, with the collection going down to 50 units from 100 units in the past,” said a blood bank official. Another coordinator of blood donation drives said social media was the only platform to reach out to people and many were apprehensive about donating blood following the pandemic. The council has also reached out to NGOs and social organizations to help and increase the number of blood donation drives. An official said the prolonged closure of offices and educational institutions had also reduced the frequency of such drives. Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh has already announced a blood donation drive in Khed on Wednesday. The council official said the “replacement donor” theory adopted by hospitals should be stopped and the health hubs should instead plan blood donation drives. Some hospitals have been conducting blood donation drives to replenish the stock. Dr Sanjay Patil, chairperson of the Hospital Board of India’s Pune chapter, said, “The Indian Medical Association had reached out to several Ganesh mandals to conduct blood donation camps. But people’s response to such initiatives was minimal because of the pandemic. We are planning to conduct more drives in the near future.” Dr Patil said with dengue patients needing more blood platelets and elective surgeries resuming, there was definitely a growing demand for more blood units.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/maharashtra-state-has-just-10-days-of-blood-stock-to-rev-up-donor-camps/articleshow/86414688.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Visitors won’t be able to enjoy the beauty of the architectural marvel, mural paintings and other historical objects inside the 453-year-old Jewish Synagogue and 476-year-old Dutch Palace in Mattancherry. The synagogue remains closed due to the Jewish festival ‘Sukkot’. Moreover, the road leading to the monument has been dug by the Cochin Smart Mission Ltd (CSML) to lay underground cables and later to pave the stretch with stones. Shopkeepers are unhappy with the slow pace of work. “Hundreds of tourists reaching Kochi in the cruise ship will flock to Fort Kochi and Mattancherry on Wednesday. But the road leading to the synagogue is in bad condition due to the ongoing works. Though the drainage works in Jew Town had started in February this year, it has not been completed so far. Also, many allied works are pending. There is lapse in work at Mattancherry Jew Town, which is an important tourism destination,” says Junaid Sulaiman, secretary of Kerala handicraft welfare association, Jew town. Meanwhile, a CSML spokesperson said the current works on the road leading to the synagogue was not part of the beautification project initially. “The work was taken up considering the importance of the area. The work got delayed due to shortage of underground cables. We will complete the works by September 30,” said a CSML spokesperson. While Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) officials said they have not received any approval from the state archaeology department to open the Dutch Palace. “We are ready to open the palace. Since it is a closed environment, we are awaiting permission from the state archaeology department. We have written to the department seeking clarity on opening museums. Once it is opened, only those vaccinated with both doses will be allowed to enter the monument,” said an ASI official. Fort Kochi councillor Antony Kureethara said archaeological monuments should be opened to revive tourism in the area.  “All stakeholders, including government officials, should come forward to open up all the structures related to tourism. Visitors travelling to the area by vehicles without entering the monuments, will not bring any good to the tourism sector,” Kureethara said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/synagogue-dutch-palace-wait-for-nod-to-reopen/articleshow/86406524.cms||T C Sreemol

ELMCH principal Prof MM Faridi said that Mishra was impressed by the innovative technology during his visit to the college on Tuesday and told him that sharing it with other countries will benefit medical science. ELMCH has developed simulation games to inculcate both basic and complex medical skills in students. Various medical skills—from administering injections to putting catheters and incubation—have been incorporated in 3D animation games on which students can learn and practice skills on dummy patients with various medical conditions requiring different treatment approaches. “Students later try the skills on silicon mannequins with electronic circuits that alert them if any procedure is going wrong,” said Prof Faridi and added, “ELMCH is the only hospital using this technology at present.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/indian-envoy-lauds-eras-tech-teaching-tool/articleshow/86410987.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Unleashing a raft of poll promises on Tuesday, Kejriwal said if AAP forms the government in Goa, they would provide a monthly allowance of Rs 5,000 to mining and tourism-dependent families till the sector restarts and would help provide one job to each unemployed youth per family, and till they gain employment, the state would provide a monthly dole of Rs 3,000. Elections for the 40-member Goa assembly are expected early next year. He also said that a ‘skills university’ would be established in Goa to train unemployed youth to make them employable. “At present, government jobs are reserved for Goans and there is a 15-year domicile requirement,” he said. AAP promises Rs 3k a month to unemployed Goan youth“Private jobs are not reserved for Goans. We will bring in a law to also reserve 80% of jobs in the private sector for Goans,” he said. “Some youth told me how the government engages outside agencies, who get people from out of Goa. There is also the fear that the same may happen in the mining sector once operations resume. That is why we will reserve these jobs for Goans,” Kejriwal said. He said 20% of the jobs would remain open in case some specific expertise is required and a person trained in it is not available in Goa. “We will make arrangements to provide a job to one unemployed youth from every household in Goa. Till the time the youth does not find employment, he or she will be provided assistance of Rs 3,000 per month,” Kejriwal promised. “Because of Covid, tourism has been badly hit in Goa, and many families are finding it hard to make ends meet. Till the time the sector resumes full-fledged operations, these families will be provided an allowance of Rs 5,000,” he said. Those dependent on mining have also lost employment due to the mining closure in Goa, and are on the verge of starvation, he said, adding that these families will also be provided Rs 5,000 per month until mining resumes. “Many youths told me that you need to have contacts with an MLA or minister here to bag a government job. Without bribes or money, one cannot get a government job in Goa. We will stop this,” he said. “The common youth of Goa will have a right to these jobs, without having to pay or use contacts. We will make the entire system transparent and accountable. Government jobs will be allotted on merit,” Kejriwal said. He also said many Goans are forced to leave the state in search of work, but this can be changed. “Sectors like tourism provide infinite possibilities to generate employment if the government has the will to do it,” Kejriwal said. “As per some statistics, 50% of the youth in Goa are unemployed, and the government here has said that it is because they do not have requisite skills. It is the government who has to give them the skills and prepare the youth for jobs. We have started a skills university in Delhi, we will establish such a skills university in Goa. The university imparts skills to youth after Class XII and tie-ups with industry help them find employment,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/kejriwal-doles-for-jobless-80-quota-for-goans-in-pvt-sector/articleshow/86411024.cms||---

Ella said the company is trying to tackle this by increasing its filling capacity at its Chiron Behring facility at Ankleshwar in Gujarat and that Covaxin supply is set to increase to 5.5 crore doses in October. “We are supplying 3.5 crore (doses) this month and next month we will definitely be supplying 55 million doses,” Ella said on the sidelines of a two-day conference organised by the Union ministry of commerce & industry, Directorate General of Foreign Trade, Telangana government and Pharmexcil here. Pointing out that while earlier it was constraints in drug substance manufacturing that had hobbled Covaxin output, Ella said that now constraints in filling capacities are coming in the way of quick ramp-up. “We are facing a problem of filling capacities so we have now increased filling capacity in Gujarat plant. Earlier filling capacity was there but bulk drug substance was less, now drug substance is more but filling capacity is less…so (the situation is) changing…,” Ella said. He also pointed out that though the output from the Bengaluru facilities, which are owned by its affiliate Biovet, will be less in September, it will increase in October as the company has got the licence (for Covaxin manufacturing at the second facility) one week back. “Bengaluru is catching up very well... We have two facilities in Bengaluru. One is fully ramped up. The second one next month that also will be there...but the first one we are already producing 2-2.5 crore from there…,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/filling-capacityhurdle-now-hitscovaxin-output/articleshow/86408773.cms||Swati Bharadwaj

Students allege that details like unfilled vacancies of SC/ST students are not published on websites of many institutions, and SC/ST seats are being filled by conducting spot allotment simply by issuing short notice of one day in local pages of print media. Adishakthi Summer School, a tribal welfare organization, has written to the governor and education minister seeking action. “Though a mandatory reservation is ensured in the prospectus, the procedure for filling vacancies relating SC/ST is kept vague or not transparent. No autonomous colleges in Ernakulam are following SC/ST special allotment procedure in a transparent way, as followed by the Mahatma Gandhi University (MGU). Unfilled vacancies of SC/ST are not published on their website, while every other matter relating to college admission is published on their website. As the procedure followed is not transparent, the opportunity for aspiring students, especially scheduled tribe students, are denied the opportunity of availing mandatory reservations,” said Mary Lydia, coordinator of Adishakthi Summer School. A majority of the tribal students are hailing from faraway places like Wayanad, Attapady, Idukki and other forest areas. By not publishing the number of seats remaining for SC/ST on the website transparently, the constitutional rights of several SC/ST students, especially adivasi students, are being denied by institutions. The letter to the governor, who is the chancellor of state varsities, and education minister, seeks to issue necessary guidelines to all autonomous colleges to reopen the final phase of spot allotment publishing the data relating to SC/ST on the website if the allotment procedure was concluded without following the rules. Lydia said that SC/ST special allotment that would ensure statutorily mandated reservation for dalit and adivasi students was carried out properly only in Calicut University and MGU. However, SC/ST students are not granted adequate time to register and complete their applications. “The time frame often is as little as 36 hours. Such a short window makes it infeasible for students hailing from remote areas and vulnerable backgrounds to participate in. Hence the government should issue a directive to the universities to conduct the registration process for at least 5-7 days,” she said. Another issue raised by tribal students is the conversion of SC/ST seats to the general category practiced by universities and autonomous colleges. “It is unconstitutional and takes opportunity away from already vulnerable students from pursuing higher education. We request the government to give directives to all universities and autonomous colleges to not convert SC/ST seats to other categories till the last stage of the admission process,” said Lydia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/tribal-students-struggling-to-get-admission-in-colleges/articleshow/86408805.cms||---

A council official said it had around 40,000 blood units in the 350 blood banks across the state. “This can last for 8-10 days as against the usual buffer of 15-20 days,” the official said. The council has attributed the situation to the decline in blood donation camps, lower footfall of donors due to the pandemic and social organizations’ failure to organize such events amid Covid-induced restrictions. The council has requested collectors and commissioners to help the public health department organize blood donation camps in adherence to the Covid protocols. “More blood donation camps with the local authorities’ help will replenish the depleting stock in the blood banks of the state. We need to have such camps frequently and not just once,” said State Blood Transfusion Council assistant director Dr Arun Thorat. Blood donation camps that were announced earlier had witnessed a huge response. “Response to the camps held recently was relatively low, with the collection going down to 50 units from 100 units in the past,” said a blood bank official. Another coordinator of blood donation drives said social media was the only platform to reach out to people and many were apprehensive about donating blood following the pandemic. The council has also reached out to NGOs and social organizations to help and increase the number of blood donation drives. An official said the prolonged closure of offices and educational institutions had also reduced the frequency of such drives. Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh has already announced a blood donation drive in Khed on Wednesday. The council official said the “replacement donor” theory adopted by hospitals should be stopped and the health hubs should instead plan blood donation drives. Some hospitals have been conducting blood donation drives to replenish the stock. Dr Sanjay Patil, chairperson of the Hospital Board of India’s Pune chapter, said, “The Indian Medical Association had reached out to several Ganesh mandals to conduct blood donation camps. But people’s response to such initiatives was minimal because of the pandemic. We are planning to conduct more drives in the near future.” Dr Patil said with dengue patients needing more blood platelets and elective surgeries resuming, there was definitely a growing demand for more blood units.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-state-has-just-10-days-of-blood-stock-to-rev-up-donor-camps/articleshow/86410979.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, who held a review meeting on the RTC and electricity department, asked the officials to come up with proposals on enhancement of charges. The government has not revised the electricity tariff in the last seven years after formation of the state. The power distribution companies generally submit their aggregate revenue requirement (ARR) to the Telangana State Electricity Regulatory Commission (TSERC) in November every year and any hike will come into effect from the next financial year. But, the discoms may seek the permission of the TSERC to permit them to increase the tariff immediately. Both the Telangana Southern Power Distribution Company Limited and Telangana Northern Power Distribution Company Limited have been facing a huge revenue gap due to rising power cost and losing revenue towards power subsidies for agriculture and other sectors. Senior RTC officials told the CM that the corporation was facing severe financial losses. Due to the pandemic and lockdowns, RTC’s losses touched Rs 3,000 crore in the past one year. While all the 97 depots are in losses, in Hyderabad alone, the losses swelled to Rs 90 crore a month. Officials recalled the government had announced on the floor of the assembly in March 2020 that RTC fares would be hiked. “But, the fares have not been increased due to Covid-19. The diesel prices increased by Rs 22 in the past one year and as a result, the RTC is saddled with Rs 550 crore additional burden annually. Similarly, bus tyres and spare parts’ rates have also gone up. The overall additional burden is about Rs 600 crore for the corporation,” officials explained. KCR said the government wanted to turn the corner for the RTC and began efforts in this regard two years ago but there was no improvement due to the pandemic, lockdowns and rising costs of fuel. He said the government would take every step to put RTC back on track. Ministers KT Rama Rao, Puvvada Ajay Kumar and G Jagadish Reddy, RTC chairman Bajireddy Govardhan, chief secretary Somesh Kumar and RTC MD VC Sajjanar were present. Senior RTC officials told the CM that the corporation was facing severe financial losses. Due to the pandemic and lockdowns, RTC’s losses touched Rs 3,000 crore in the past one year.

---||Hyderabad||Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Tamil Nadu high on drug-resistant bacteria in aquaculture: Report||HYDERABAD: A two-decade analysis of anti-microbial resistance from aquaculture and fisheries in Asia shows Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Tamil Nadu have emerged as multi-drug-resistant hotspots. The other hotspots of multi-drug resistance in freshwater environments include eastern Turkey, Yangtze river in China, Poyang lake, Mekong river and its delta in southern Cambodia and Vietnam. In the latest edition of Nature, researchers analysed 749 antibiotic-resistant bacteria from aquatic animals in Asia with help of data extracted from 343 articles published from 2000 to 2019. “We found concerning levels of resistance to medically important antimicrobials in food-borne pathogens. In aquaculture, the percentage of antimicrobial compounds per survey with resistance exceeded 50% between 2000 and 2018,” the research says. Researchers mapped anti-microbial resistance at 10-km resolution and found resistance hotspots along major river systems in Asia and the coastal waters of India and China. The study was conducted by Centre for Diseases Dynamics, Thomas P. Van Boeckel of Economics and Police based at New Delhi, Spatial Epidemiology Laboratory of Université Libre de Bruxelles and Institute for Environmental Decisions based in Zurich. The aquatic food industry has emerged as one of the largest consumer of anti-mirobial drugs. Certain species of fish like catfish are found to be associates with more anti-microbial use rate per kilogram when compared to humans and terrestrial animals. The study suggested calling up surveillance to strengthen epidemiological evidence on anti-microbial resistance. “The analysis done by researchers revealed startling facts. It is a big wake up call. The central and state governments should come up with aquaculture and fisheries interventions to mitigate the impact of anti-microbial resistance as suggested by experts,” marine biologist Dr Duggaraju Srinivasa Rao said. “Catfish is illegally cultured and sold as murrel fish. Most of the hotels serve catfish in the name of Apollo fish,” Rao added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ap-among-global-aqua-anti-microbial-resistance-hotspots/articleshow/86412625.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy
---||Pune||Pune: Rs 50 lakh for kin of daily wagers who died on Covid-19 duty||PUNE: The general body of the PMC on Tuesday approved the proposal to provide a compensation of Rs50 lakh to the kin of the workers on contract and daily wagers who lost their lives on Covid-19 duty. “Though the civic staffers were already the beneficiaries of the compensation, the benefit will now be extended to the workers on contract and daily wagers as well. The maximum compensation should be based on the state and Union governments’ guidelines,” stated the proposal. The corporators were unanimous that the daily wagers and contractual workers had toiled in the time of the pandemic by risking their lives. They said such workers deserved the compensation even if they were not direct employees of the civic body and a special provision should be made to accommodate them as the beneficiaries. The demand was unanimously approved by all parties in the civic body. A Pune Municipal Crporation (PMC) official said the civic administration had already started the insurance scheme for its staffers. Civic data revealed that 47 staff members had succumbed to the Covid-19 pandemic. Some of their dependents have already received the compensation. “The process for others is still underway,” the official said. Along with the PMC’s help, assistance from the state and Union governments would also be made available to these family members, the official said. Another PMC official said the staff members were working at civic hospitals, ambulances and flu centres during the pandemic. The official added that around 16,000 people were directly or indirectly working in the mitigation of Coronavirus outbreak. The PMC in its scheme has also given the option of providing job to one of the family members of the staffer who succumbed to Covid. The official said the staff members had earlier conducted a survey of likely positive patients. Over 900 teams were formed for door-to-door survey of positive patients. The teams included health officials, teachers and conservancy staff. Their target was to reach out to every household in the city and check the health of residents. In other decisions, the elected members demanded funds for the 23 villages merged with the PMC limits. They also raised the issue of poor civic infrastructure management in these areas. Commissioner Vikram Kumar informed the GB that funds had been diverted for water supply, garbage disposal and paying electricity charges. “The process of recruitment for health department, education department is on the cards. The civic administration will take under its possession primary health centres and schools. They will be handed over to the PMC free of cost,” he said. A memorial for Corona Warriors will be built in the PMC areas. It will highlight the work carried out by the various people, including health workers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rs-50l-for-kin-of-daily-wagers-who-died-on-corona-duty/articleshow/86408820.cms||---

The government is planning to hold the session for at least one week. This session is significant as the assembly is convened after six months, especially after Nagarjuna Sagar by-election and after the exit of former minister Eatala Rajender from TRS. Both ruling TRS and opposition parties will hold preparatory meetings before the session. The TRS wants a full-fledged debate on Dalit Bandhu scheme, which was launched in four mandals in four assembly constituencies apart from Huzurabad and Vasalamarri village, CM K Chandrasekhar Rao’s adopted village. The opposition parties have been demanding a similar scheme for BCs by depositing Rs 10 lakh each in the beneficiaries’ accounts. The TRS leadership is getting ready to counter the parties by asking them to implement such schemes in Congress and BJP-ruled states first. TRS sources said the government would make a statement or hold a discussion on water sharing issues with AP and row over alleged illegal projects taken up by AP. There are a couple of ordinances which need to be approved by the legislative assembly. “The government is ready for a debate or discussion on any issue,” a government whip said. The opposition parties are likely to corner the government on the minor girl rape and murder in Saidabad. The parties are also likely to raise the issue of Kokapet land auction and the drugs case. Interestingly, the legislative council session will be held without a full-fledged chairman. MLC Bhoopal Reddy has been acting as pro-tem chairman.

Virologists say many people opt for home remedies or pop paracetamols without knowing that viruses can cause long-lasting damages to the heart and can be life-threatening if not reported early. “Virus can damage the myocardial cells and attack the conductivity of heart. Currently, more cases are being seen due to the Covid-19 scenario as this virus has a higher level of impact,” said Dr Ranga Reddy Burri, infection control and prevention specialist. Experts have identified viruses like adenovirus, rubella, influenza, parvovirus, dengue and coronaviruses as those that can potentially cause myocarditis. Cardiologists across the city’s government and private sector admit seeing more patients with damages to the artery, the heart muscles and electrical circuit of the heart, all caused by viruses. Hospitals are seeing between 5-10 cases each month of the heart getting affected post viral fevers. “Viral fevers can affect the heart muscles, arteries of the heart, valves, pulmonary artery (supply blood to the lungs) and conduction system of the heart,” said Dr Ravikanth Athuluri, consultant interventional cardiologist, Yashoda Hospital, Somajiguda. He said people should never neglect any symptoms like chest pain, blackouts and breathlessness. “In some cases, the symptoms after a few days should be taken as a warning sign. Any symptom which is alarming, like feeling choked, should also be reported to the doctor at the earliest or sudden loss of consciousness should immediately be reported,” added Dr Ravikanth. Doctors at the state-run Gandhi Medical College and Hospital said some of the viruses are cardiotropic in nature and they have a tendency to affect the heart muscles. “Viral fevers affecting the heart are called viral myocarditis and they have increased a bit due to Covid-19 as it also has a tendency for clot formation,” said Dr Nitin Kabra, professor and head of department of cardiology, Gandhi Medical College. Doctors and virologists warn that persons having viral fever should be careful in the first 48 hours while taking adequate amount of fluids and must not exert themselves. Exercising or even walking at this time can lead to increased pressure on the heart which in turn can affect the heart function, doctors say. Clot formation issues associated with viruses like MERS, hepatitis, Covid-19 and other coronaviruses may lead to venous thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, etc. “However, just 2 or 3 out of 100 patients may land into the condition but when they do, it can be life-threatening,” added Dr Kabra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/viruses-can-trigger-heart-damage-experts/articleshow/86408844.cms||Amrita Didyala

Number of female beneficiaries was higher than males, probably for the first time since launch of Covid-19 vaccination programme. NMC and ZP conducted special vaccination drive for women on Tuesday in the district as per directives of guardian minister Nitin Raut. It was a part of preparations for the projected third wave. Main motive behind the drive was to ensure that entire family, especially children, will be safe once even women are inoculated. Also, if women have completed two doses, they can take care of their children if the latter are infected. Average daily vaccination of the district in last 15 days was 19,829. On Tuesday, 27,733 took the jab for an increase of 40%. The data is as per central government portal. The district information office (DIO) could give bifurcation of 27,262 beneficiaries. As per DIO, 14,752 (54.11%) of total beneficiaries were women, 12,506 (45.87%) were men, and four were from others category. Sources from NMC and ZP told TOI it was probably the first time since launch of vaccination on January 16 that number of women was higher than men in a day. It is also evident from the data, as 34,92,303 total doses have been completed in the district as on Tuesday. Of total doses, first doses were 25,07,311 and second doses were 9,84,992. Of total doses, male beneficiaries were 18,24,735 (52.25%), females 16,66,980 (47.73%) and others 588 (0.02). Overall, women are lagging behind men in vaccination in the district. As a part of the special drive for women, NMC and ZP reached out to residential localities to find unvaccinated women. NMC chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Chilkar told TOI, “We engaged 762 ASHA workers who visited door-to-door in few localities and identified areas where women in large numbers are yet to be vaccinated. Our team went to around 46 localities and inoculated groups of women in their areas itself.” Dr Chilkar added some women themselves turned up at the vaccination centres on hearing of special vaccination drive organized for them. “Females were given special preference at centres.” The special drive was only for one day. Dr Chilkar also said, “NMC will facilitate vaccination for women in their localities if we get high numbers in a particular area. Already, NMC teams are visiting slum areas and inoculating all people who are yet to take first dose,” he said. The ZP engaged its team, Anganwadi sevikas, women self-help-groups, public representatives etc to identify women who are yet to take the jab, and vaccinated them on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/vax-nos-rise-by-40-on-tue-due-to-womens-special-drive/articleshow/86408868.cms||Anjaya Anparthi

The AP government has recently written a letter to Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) demanding that the board install telemetry at locations near Nagarjunasagar upstream areas where Godavari water is being diverted to Krishna by Telangana and share the water between the two states. Rejecting AP claims, Telangana government engineer-in-chief (irrigation) C Muralidhar in a letter to KRMB chairman on Monday said that AP had no right to demand installation of telemetry at the diversion sites as per the Krishna and Godavari water tribunals. “All the schemes mentioned by AP were contemplated by the united AP government and these areas would have been provided with irrigation facilities from Krishna through the Srisailam left canal system proposed with 150 tmcft up to Munneru valley by gravity. Nandikonda joint project report of 1954 contemplated one lakh acres irrigated through lift from Nagarjunasagar left canal after main Nagarjunasagar project power house is completed,” Muralidhar said. He further said, “AP government deliberately ignored Nandikonda project and preferred areas outside the basin even though they were not part of Krishna basin.” As per the KWDT-1 and riparian states agreements, all the states were at liberty to divert their part of Godavari share to any other basin and in lieu of their share, and no other state could raise a claim over such diversion, Muralidhar pointed out. “The Telangana areas which are being served by Godavari water is not provided irrigation facilities by Krishna water. But diversion being made by AP is to areas already irrigated by Krishna,” the engineer-in-chief said. Claiming that AP government’s demands were baseless, he said, “No deduction of share in Krishna arises and allegation made by AP is misleading and incorrect as they are neither replacing the existing irrigation by Krishna nor are they using surplus water of Godavari.” Telangana government engineer-in-chief, C Muralidhar, rejected AP government’s claims and in a letter written to KRMB, he dais AP had no right to demand installation of telemetry at the diversion sites as per the Krishna and Godavari water tribunals||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-ap-clash-over-diversion-of-godavari-water-to-krishna-basin/articleshow/86411058.cms||Koride Mahesh

The MLAs were suspended after the state government accused them of misbehaving with the presiding officer in the speaker’s chamber. The assembly passed a resolution by a majority vote for their suspension. The ECI directed that a separate polling party as well as a separate ballot box along with requisite number of ballot papers for the electors be arranged. The polling station will be open from 9 am to 4 pm even if all MLAs cast their vote before 4 pm. After the close of polling, the ballot box will betaken to the counting centre under security and counting of votes is to be taken up only after mixing these ballot papers with the rest of the ballot papers from the main polling booth.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-spl-booth-for-12-suspended-mlas-to-cast-rs-bypoll-vote/articleshow/86412638.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: ‘Reluctance among vaccinated to donate blood a worry’||PUNE: Experts have expressed concerns over the fact that many citizens were not coming forward to donate blood after getting vaccinated against Covid-19. The experts said a vaccinated person can donate blood 14 days after receiving the first or the second vaccine dose. Rise in elective surgeries after the decline in Covid cases, a steady flow of pregnant women needing transfusion for obstetric reasons, and the spurt in dengue cases necessitating platelet transfusion have collectively led to an increased demand for blood and related products across the state. “The earlier government guidelines allowed blood donation only 28 days ater full vaccination with both doses. The latest government guidelines, released in May, allow vaccination 14 days after either taking the first or the second dose. At a time when the vaccination numbers, especially with the first dose, are soaring across Maharashtra, there is less awareness about the revised guidelines among the vaccinated people, resulting in very few turning up for blood donation,” said pathologist Atul Kulkarni, director of Jankalyan Blood Bank in Pune. Usually, colleges, IT firms, industries, and social organizations are among the main contributors. “The colleges are still closed. IT firms and industries have just started gearing up and streamlining their work. As a result, holding blood donation camps may not be their prime focus. Besides, awareness among the vaccinated people is also low about when they can donate blood,” Kulkarni said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mumbai-reluctance-among-vaxxed-to-donate-blood-a-worry/articleshow/86411071.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Delhi||NHRC’s notice over welfare of transgenders||New Delhi: National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has issued a notice to the secretary of Delhi government’s social welfare department on the basis of a complaint against not initiating proposed welfare measures for transgender people in the capital. NHRC has sought an action-taken report from the department within six weeks. The complainant, Dr Aqsa Shaikh, associate professor of the community medicine department at Hamdard Institute of Medical Sciences and Research of Jamia Hamdard in Delhi, alleged that the social welfare department had conducted meetings for implementation of the welfare schemes for transgender people under Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act 2019, but no action had been taken since the last meeting in February. At the February 12 meeting, it was proposed to issue an order for the formation of a transgender welfare board, she said. Among other decisions taken in the meeting were formulation of a policy for transgender people, creation of separate toilets in government buildings for them and placing draft state rules in the public domain for inviting comments or observations, added Dr Shaikh. The complainant, who had attended a few meetings as a representative of the community, sought intervention of the commission regarding action on the proposed welfare measures, especially setting up the state transgender welfare board, building transgender toilets and providing healthcare facilities to such people. Dr Shaikh told TOI, “People with non-binary identity do not feel safe or comfortable in going to the toilets meant for men or women. They feel threatened by the presence of others in the toilets. Such places are also a source of harassment for transgender people.” On healthcare facilities, she said, “According to the 2019 Act, the state has to provide gender-affirmation surgeries. We have been demanding gender-affirmation services and separate wards or reserved beds for transgender people in the government hospitals.” Claiming that transgender people are not a “priority group”, Dr Shaikh said, “The community is often ignored as they are not a pressure group or vote bank for any political party.” The Act mandates appropriate governments to take welfare measures for transgender people, the complainant pointed out. “It has been more than six months since the last meeting, but no action is visible. This is an impediment to transgender people’s welfare in Delhi.” Taking cognisance of the complaint, NHRC said, “Let a copy of the complaint be transmitted to the secretary, department of social welfare, Delhi government calling an action-taken report on the issue within a period of six weeks.” A Delhi government official said both the 2019 Act and Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Rules, 2020 were already in place. As far as the welfare board is concerned, the department is awaiting the Union home ministry to issue a notification empowering the lieutenant governor to frame the rules.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/nhrcs-notice-over-welfare-of-transgenders/articleshow/86408889.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

Also, in general medical practice, these are largely clubbed as viral fevers and not investigated because they are known to be self-limiting and not life-threatening. But doctors have been left perplexed by delay in recovery and inability to pinpoint the cause. In many cases, these fevers continue for over 15-20 days without any signs of improvement. “While generally these kinds of fevers are categorised as viral fevers and tend to self-limit within a few days, we are now seeing some cases which are not recovering as expected. There are cases where a patient has been on paracetamol for over a week and still not recovered. They seem to be taking longer than usual to recover,” said a doctor from the state-run Fever Hospital, adding that majority of the cases did not require hospital admission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-tests-to-crack-fever-mystery/articleshow/86408852.cms||---

---||Lucknow||After ‘visarjan’, monumental clean-up in Lucknow||LUCKNOW: With Lucknow Municipal Corporation yet to begin cleaning of pollutants left behind in the Gomti after immersion of Ganesh idols, a group of volunteers has taken up the task to pick idols floating in the river and remove waste accumulated along the banks. The group took the decision after visiting the Gomti ghats where they found garbage strewn all over the bank and deposited in the puddles along the shoreline, threatening flora and fauna of the river. A lone artificial pit created earlier was also full of trash.The entire area was reeking of a foul smell. A view of Jhule Lal Vatika where idols and puja items lay strewn after immersionSuch a situation, the volunteers said, has been created because the LMC did not make artificial ponds or pits for the land immersion of idols this year, resulting in most devotees performing the ritual directly in the river, while some using an old artificial pit created earlier. Also, no one from the civic body has come so far to clean up the banks even two days after the conclusion of the Ganesh Puja, they added The group, comprising 25 members of Swachh Paryavaran Andolan Sena (SPAS), hired three boats, bought some nets and started fishing out idols floating or submerged in the river. They also brought paraphernalia to collect waste and clear hyacinth from the banks “In two days, we have taken out around 1,000 small and medium size idols from the river water near Jhulelal Vatika and respectfully performed their land immersion. Some tiny idols were placed around a tree in the compound of a temple located on the banks,” said Ranjeet Singh, the team leader and former corporator of Mankameshwar Ward under which the area falls. All team members arrive at around 5am and devote four hours daily for the noble cause, he added. “We will continue our campaign till the entire area is cleaned and also ask LMC to make provision for artificial pits for idol immersion during Durga Puja next month,” said Jeet Sharma, a SPAS member. The practice of land immersion of idols in Lucknow started in 2019 on the direction of the high court, which took a serious view of alarmingly high pollution levels in the rivers in the state. The practice was carried out successfully for two years, but this time LMC failed to comply with the court order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/after-visarjan-monumental-clean-up/articleshow/86411032.cms||Pranchal Srivastava

The chairperson said that the nomenclature ‘Dalit’ does not find mention in the Constitution of the country or any statute and moreover, the Union ministry of social justice and empowerment has already directed all chief secretaries of the state governments and Union territory administrations on this issue. She said the Madhya Pradesh high court bench in Gwalior had passed an order on January 15, 2018, in a public interst litigation ‘Dr Mohan Lal Mahor Vs Union of India & Ors’ and had directed that “the central government/state government and its functionaries would refrain from using the nomenclature ‘Dalit’ for the members belonging to scheduled castes and scheduled tribes as the same does not find mention in the Constitution of India or any statute”. The chairperson said that the Union ministry had directed all the state governments and Union territory administrations to use the word “scheduled caste” instead of “Dalit” for the persons belonging to scheduled castes. Earlier, the Punjab state commission for scheduled castes in a letter on September 13 addressed to chief secretary Vini Mahajan had also recommended to rename the villages, towns and other places which are presently named after castes and not use derogatory names such as Chamarheri etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/dont-use-word-dalit-to-identify-any-person-punjab-sc-commission/articleshow/86408854.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Your left hand knows what your right hand did!||AHMEDABAD: As the famous adage goes, the left hand shouldn’t know what the right is doing — if the context is of charity or noble deeds, indicating its utmost private nature. But a study carried out by researchers at IIT Gandhinagar (IIT-Gn) claim that the left hand indeed knows what the right is doing! Goldy Yadav, who got her PhD degree from the institute during the recent convocation, got it in Cognitive Science discipline with title ‘Interlimb Generalization of Newly Learned Motor Skills’. “My earlier work was focused on cognitive science and brain functions. My doctoral work expanded the scope to understand whether the skills learnt by one side of the body (only hands were tested) can be transferred to the other side,” said Yadav, who is now a post-doc research fellow in Belgium. Skill acquisition, primarily motor skills, gives an insight into how the human brain functions, said Yadav. The study consisted of right-handed individuals who were taught new skills, like making highly accurate movements in a short amount of time on a computer-tablet setup. “When we ask a right-handed person to do the task with left hand, it’s generally a speed and accuracy trade-off. But during our trials, we observed robust and symmetric inter-limb transfer across the arms in contrast to an asymmetry observed in a number of motor adaptation studies. Interestingly, neither the magnitude nor the directionality of transfer was affected by task level variability,” she said. Prof Pratik Mutha, a senior faculty at IIT-Gn and Yadav’s research guide, said that the study has implications for stroke or paralysis patients who have lost control over one side of the body. “The conventional approach focuses more on the immobile limbs by stimulating it. But one can’t train it much. But if we apply the learning from the study, we can train the unaffected side and can improve the recovery rate,” he said, adding that an insight into how we learn these skills can also help in strategizing the rehabilitation programmes for those with locomotor issues.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/your-left-hand-knows-what-your-right-hand-did/articleshow/86411036.cms||Parth Shastri

---||Pune||Many children get dengue, 20% need hospitalization||Pune: A number of children below 15 years are getting diagnosed with dengue and the main complaints among the most are pain behind the eyes and bi-phasic fever — breaking and then returning after one or two days. Hospitals across the city have noted a considerable rise in dengue-affected children being rushed for admission following drop in platelet counts. Doctors advised parents against freaking out over plummeting platelet counts, which usually start improving within 10 days. The dengue illness is often mild in children and most recover faster than adults. “Besides adults, dengue is afflicting many kids in Pune. Most complain of high-grade fever, initially with headache and body pain. Pain behind the eyes and bi-phasic fever, both classical dengue symptoms, are being seen in most kids, which is not very often seen in adult dengue patients these days,” said senior paediatrician Pramod Jog, also a member of the state’s paediatric Covid task force. Although most kids recover at home with doctors’ and parents’ care, about 10-20% of children diagnosed with dengue are needing hospitalisation because of complications like severe dehydration and terrible drop in blood pressure — medically termed as dengue shock syndrome. “There is a very atypical picture of dengue this year. About 10-20% of kids are needing hospital care, including paediatric intensive care,” said Jehangir Hospital’s chief paediatrician Sanjay Bafna. Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital’s paediatric intensivist Sumant Patil said, “About 40% of our paediatric ICU beds are occupied with kids diagnosed with dengue. Most of them have dengue shock syndrome.” In classic dengue fever, there is a biphasic fever pattern. Doctors advised parents to monitor the kids if they have bi-phasic fever because the second bout of fever may land kids in complications. During the first phase, there is an abrupt onset of fever for two to five days with nausea, chills, body ache and retro-orbital (behind the eyes) pain. “The initial abrupt high-grade fever goes down on the fourth or fifth day and comes again after one or two days. This is called biphasic fever,” Jog said. Parents have to be careful when the kids get fever for the second time. “This is when the body’s immune reaction may get triggered. Parents often become lax when the first bout of fever subsides with paracetamol. They need to be vigilant when the child gets the second bout of fever,” Jog said. Tracking the child’s white blood cell count on a regular basis becomes very crucial when the child gets a fever for the second time after a small break of one or two days. “White blood cells in the child’s blood go down before the drop in platelet count. Hence, we have to check the child’s complete blood count (CBC) serially almost every day at this stage and keep a chart of it, especially when a child comes with fever for the second time,” Jog said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/many-children-get-dengue-20-need-hospitalization/articleshow/86408890.cms||Umesh Isalkar

Police have arrested the accused who knew the family. During interrogation, the man confessed that he raped and murdered the girl under the influence of alcohol. Locals have demanded capital punishment for the accused. According to police, the girl went missing at 3pm on Monday and a massive hunt was soon launched by her family and villagers to locate her. The victim was found murdered late in the evening. “During investigation, it was found that Dinesh (25) had come to meet the girl’s mother. He claimed he considers her mother as his sister. When he had to return, he asked the family to send somebody with him so that street dogs did not attack him. The family sent their daughter along. The girl then went missing,” said a senior police officer of Nagaur on Tuesday. Since the girl was last seen with the accused, he was thoroughly interrogated. “It was found that he was under the influence of alcohol and that he first raped the girl and later killed her. He confessed that he killed the girl to ensure that the rape did not come to light,” said the officer. Preliminary investigation suggested the accused used to supply DJ sound systems for marriages and parties. Meanwhile, locals have demanded capital punishment for accused.

---||Pune||Study: Covid symptoms in kids changed in 2nd wave||Pune: Researchers from BJ Government Medical College and Sassoon General Hospital observed in a recent study that Covid symptoms in children underwent changes during the second wave of the pandemic. In a study conducted among 84 children infected with severe Covid, researchers found that the clinical symptoms of Covid-19 in kids were now wider than previously described, often with nonspecific signs and manifestations, including a wider prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms. These signs should raise suspicion of Covid while diagnosis, senior researchers stated. Lead researcher Dr Rajesh Kulkarni, department of paediatrics, BJ Government Medical College and Sassoon General Hospital, said, “We found a few children with unusual symptoms like seizures, loss of taste and smell during the study. Until the first wave, only a concurrent fever, cough, cold or unexplained tiredness was a tell-tale sign of Covid in children.” He said flu-like illnesses and Covid were at times difficult to differentiate in children because of common symptoms such as fever, cold and cough. The study enlisted some major symptoms during the second wave that clinicians could watch out for while trying to diagnose Covid among children. Dr Kulkarni said, “In the second wave, incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms, like vomiting and loose stools, was slightly more. Loss of smell and taste, common in adults, appeared to affect some kids in the second wave. Also, hardly much of Covid was known during the first wave. It was mainly considered as a respiratory illness that could worsen into pneumonia. With the second wave, it became known that Covid could manifest as a multi-system disease, including in children.” Another unusual finding of the study was that unlike western countries, where obesity was an associated risk, severe acute malnutrition with anaemia in children could also be a risk factor for severe Covid. “Nearly 12 malnourished children in the study developed severe Covid,” he said. “Nearly 24 children in the study had comorbidities. Vaccination could prevent severe disease in children with comorbidities. High index of suspicion and early aggressive management could prevent morbidity in such children,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/study-covid-symptoms-in-kids-changed-in-2nd-wave/articleshow/86408882.cms||Neha Madaan

Third additional chief judge Kalyan Chakravarthy of Hyderabad city civil courts issued the ex parte injunction order to this effect on Tuesday while hearing a civil suit filed by the minister. The judge issued notice to Revanth Reddy and sought his reply by October 20 on the contentions raised by KTR. Arguing for KTR, senior counsel S Niranjan Reddy said that the statements made by Revanth were in bad taste. “They are an insult to the young minister who has emerged as a role model for the youth. It is okay if the opposition leader confines his criticism to the political spectrum, but it is unfair on his part to make personal and baseless attacks,” Reddy said.

The jathedar led a ‘nagar kirtan’ (religious procession ) from Gurdwara Darbar Sahib, Kartarpur Sahib, Pakistan, up to Zero Line at Indo-Pak border, Dera Baba Nanak in Gurdaspur district, on the eve of the death anniversary of first Sikh master Guru Nanak Dev. Speaking to TOI over phone from Kartapur Sahib, a local resident Babar Jalandhari said that the Akal Takht jathedar and PSGPC office-bearers were sitting in attendance of Sri Guru Granth Sahib installed in the golden palanquin placed inside a special bus given to Gurdwara Darbar Sahib by PSGPC. Panj Payaras (five beloved ones) led the nagar kirtan up to Zero Line. “It took nearly one hour to cover a distance of around 4.5 kilometers from Gurdwara Darbar Sahib to Zero line,” he said. Sources said PSGPC president Ameer Singh and former presidents of Pakistan’s Sikh body including Satwant Singh and Bishan Singh, held a meeting with Harpreet Singh to discuss various religious issues. PSGPC follows Pal Singh Purewal authored NC which was released in 2003 by the Akal Takht whereas Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee follows the amended version of NC. It leads to much confusion among Sikhs across the world because of differences in dates of various Sikh religious occasions. Sources said PSGPC had offered to resolve the NC issue by convening a meeting of Sikh bodies in Pakistan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pak-sikh-religious-leaders-meet-akal-takht-jathedar-to-discuss-religious-issues/articleshow/86408909.cms||Yudhvir Rana

Complainant Shardanand Uniyal, who suffered fractures in both hands, accused the contractor concerned of not covering dug-up roads after laying a water pipeline at the site. The DM not only ordered the Gurugram-based company , entrusted with the construction work on the Balbir road, to pay Rs 2 lakh as compensation to the complainant but also asked the firm to bear his treatment cost. The contractor has been issued a warning that he will be blacklisted in case the roads are not repaired within two days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/biker-gets-hurt-on-bad-road-construction-firm-to-pay-rs-2l/articleshow/86406599.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||Failure to prove place of rape enough to reject prosecution’s case: HC||Nagpur: Acquitting two Gadchiroli farmers from rape charges, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court ruled that prosecution’s failure to prove the place where the assault took place is sufficient to reject its case against the accused. “Once the court feels convinced that the incident did not take place at the purported place of incident, the evidence of witnesses, who deposed about the spot, is obviously rendered unreliable. In some cases like the present one, failure to prove place of incident can be a sufficient ground to throw out prosecution’s case,” a division bench comprising justices Vinay Deshpande and Amit Borkar held. “Once evidentiary value of spot panchnama extinguishes, in the facts of present case, prosecution’s failure to prove place of incident knocks out the very bottom of its case,” the bench added, before allowing two petitions by the accused challenging their conviction by the Gadchiroli sessions court. The incident took place on January 24, 2014, when the survivor was going to her parental home with her husband at Lekurbadi village. As they failed to get the bus, they started returning to home on foot. On the way, they were allegedly accosted by the accused — Moreshwar Halami and Suresh Dakhane — along with a juvenile in conflict of law. When her husband tried to save her, they thrashed him and he fled to seek help from other villagers. The accused then dragged the woman to a nearby nullah and committed the heinous act till she fell unconscious. By the time her husband returned with the villagers, the accused had fled. Next day, she was taken to Malewada Hospital as her face was badly swollen due to the thrashing and she could not eat. She disclosed the incident to the doctor, who informed police after which an FIR was lodged. The sessions judge convicted both the accused under sections 376-D, 341, 323 of IPC and the Atrocities Act and sentenced them to 20 years of rigorous imprisonment, along with Rs10,000 fine. Both challenged the verdict through counsels Amit Band and AD Ramteke. Justices Deshpande and Borkar observed that the survivor’s unnatural conduct of not informing police about the incident and giving her statement only after being informed by the doctor was doubtful. “Absence of mud on her clothes, visiting doctor a day prior to the incident with swollen face, chest and stomach, and claim of spot panchnama recording on next day in her presence despite the fact that she was admitted to the hospital on the same morning, renders her testimony unsafe to accept.” The judges noted that once they rejected her testimony, the statements of her husband and daughter as witnesses cannot be accepted. “She had not named the second accused in her FIR. There is no evidence in the form of chemical analysis, which would implicate the petitioners. It would not be safe to sustain their conviction on statements of the survivor and her family members. It is a case wherein the petitioners deserve benefit of doubt,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/failure-to-prove-place-of-rape-enough-to-reject-prosecutions-case-hc/articleshow/86402268.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Pune||‘Activist’ among duo booked for extortion attempt of Rs 50 lakh||Pune: A “social activist”, who also claims to be a lawyer, and his aide have been booked by the city police after a prominent builder lodged a complaint, accusing them of attempting to extort Rs50 lakh from him. The builder (59) also alleged that the duo had threatened to destroy his reputation by running a campaign against his project at Fatimanagar. Inspector (crime) Shailesh Shanke of the Shivainagar police said, “We got the main suspect’s claim of being a lawyer verified and found he had no such qualification. We have booked him for forgery apart from the extortion-attempt related charges. Both the suspects are on the run and our teams are searching for them.” He said in his complaint that it all started in December 2019 when the ‘activist’ booked a shop in his commercial-cum-residential project at Fatimanagar and paid the initial booking amount. “The ‘activist’ later showed no signs of paying the remainder of Rs50 lakh and went on to illegally occupy the shop,” the complaint stated. Shanke said, “When the builder started demanding the money, the ‘activist’ and his aide started threatening him and, in turn, asked him to pay them Rs50 lakh. They said they would launch a campaign against his project and destroy his business reputation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/activist-among-duo-booked-for-extortion-attempt-of-rs-50-lakh/articleshow/86408915.cms||Gitesh Shelke
---||Hyderabad||Students in limbo over new UK jab rules||Hyderabad: The new United Kingdom international travel rules, which do not recognise Indians who have got both shots of Covid-19 vaccine as ‘fully vaccinated’ has come as a big blow to the students. On September 17, the UK had announced new rules for international travel to replace the current system of red, amber and green. As per the new rules, the UK government only considers fully vaccinated to be those who have been vaccinated under an approved vaccination programme in the UK, Europe or the US, or who were vaccinated in 17 other countries, including Australia, Israel, Japan and Singapore. Thus, even fully-vaccinated Indians have to undergo a 10-day quarantine and Covid-19 test pre-departure and on day 2 and day 8 on arrival in the UK. Terming it as a biased rule, many local students admit that they are in a limbo over the rule imposed by the UK government. “It is extremely demeaning to know that while vaccinated students from other countries are freely moving around and engaging in various induction programmes, Indian students have to undergo a 10-day quarantine period. There is no clarity if we would be asked to re-vaccinate ourselves or if we’d be allowed to visit various public places even after our quarantine period concludes,” said Anita V (name changed), a master’s student at University College, London. Many others are worried over the accommodation and Covid-19 test costs. “I have to spend almost Rs 1.10 lakh towards accommodation for 10 days. Each test costs almost Rs 14,000 and has to be taken twice during the 10-day period. All this is an additional cost,” said a master’s student of University of Westminster. Experts are hopeful that the governments of both countries will discuss this soon. “It is disappointing that as of now, people vaccinated in India are being tagged under the ‘unvaccinated’ category. So, essentially it means a status quo for Indian students as even now, they have to quarantine at home in the UK or at the university campus for 10 days. But, the students can still travel without any restrictions, which is a welcome development,” said Piyush Kumar, regional director (South Asia), IDP Education, an overseas education consultancy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/students-in-limbo-over-new-uk-jab-rules/articleshow/86408888.cms||Preeti Biswas

The entrance exam, which is conducted to give admissions into BEd seats, used to draw about two lakh applications in united Andhra Pradesh. Aspirants were ready to pay hefty amount for management quota seats. But now things are pretty different as EdCET-2021 hardly received 15,600 applications for more than 30,000 seats available at the BEd colleges. Of these applicants, only some 13,619 (87.09%) aspirants turned up to the examination conducted on Tuesday (September 21). Even if all the appeared students qualify and join the course, nearly 60% of the total seats will remain vacant. Limited opportunities in the private schools and no regular recruitments from the state government have triggered this trend. Increasing the duration of BEd course to two years has also affected the enrolment. The private schools are supposed to hire only qualified BEd/DEd teachers. But several of them are not following the norms, affecting the employment opportunities of BEd graduates. Things have deteriorated for the teaching professionals with the onslaught of the Covid-19 pandemic in the last one-and-a-half year. This might have also affected the morale of the BEd aspirants. Principal of the Ushodaya College of Education, S. Venkata Vasu, said that lack of communication and awareness due to Covid-19 and limited exam centres might have contributed to the dip in the application numbers this year. “There has also been confusion regarding the management quota seats,” said Vasu. APEdCET-2021 convenor Prof K Visweswara Rao said that the highest percent (91.53%) of attendance was recorded in Kurnool district on Tuesday, followed by Srikakulam (90.79%), Vizianagaram (89.64%) and Anantapur (88.74%). “All Covid-19 precautionary measures were implemented at all test centres. The exam went off peacefully without any untoward incidents. As many as 71 observers were appointed to monitor the examination proceedings,” said Prof Visweswara Rao. The AP EdCET-2021 was conducted in 69 test centres spread over 34 cities on Tuesday. Earlier in the morning, Andhra University Vice-Chancellor Prof PVGD Prasad Reddy, who is also the chairman of EdCET-2021, selected SET-1 question paper for the exam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/seats-far-outnumber-bed-applicants-in-ap/articleshow/86406634.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Tribals to get homes on land owned by Force One in Aarey Milk Colony||Mumbai: The tribal residents of three adivasi padas will be provided alternative accommodation on five acres of Force One land in Aarey Milk Colony. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday approved the plan to shift the adivasis to the Force One land. The non-adivasi residents will be provided tenements meant for Project Affected Persons (PAPs). While the Maharashtra Housing Area Development Authority will build the houses for the tribals, the Slum Rehabilitation Authority will provide the PAP tenements. After the 26/11 terror attack on Mumbai, the then state government decided to set up an elite counter-terrorism force on the lines of the National Security Guards. The Force One was initially provided land at Kalina, Santacruz. However, the land was insufficient for training purposes. The government then allotted 98.6 acres of Aarey Milk Colony land to the force. Shiv Sena MLA Ravindra Waikar, who represents Jogeshwari assembly constituency that includes the Aarey Milk Colony, said there are three adivasi padas – Chafa 1, Chafa 2 and Kelti pada – in the vicinity of the Force One land. “Owing to the presence of these padas, the force cannot use the area for its firing range. Since 2012, I have been urging the government to shift them elsewhere,” he said. As per a 2016 survey, there are 418 households in the three padas of which 315 are adivasis, 92 non-tribals and seven temples. Four rooms are closed. Waikar said there will be an exchange of land wherein tribals will be rehabilitated on five acres of Force One land and the padas taken over by the security force for their firing range. The adivasis will be provided 400-500 sq feet independent homes. However, many grow vegetables and sell fruits. They are unlikely to be given any land for cultivation. Waikar said they may be provided employment. In the past, tribals have opposed any kind of survey and takeover of their land by Force One. “Around 32 acres is cultivated by us. We are strongly opposed to any relocation. Government is not holding any discussions with us and simply taking decisions on our behalf,” said a local tribal resident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-tribals-to-get-homes-on-land-owned-by-force-one-in-aarey-milk-colony/articleshow/86412659.cms||Clara Lewis

Overall, Vidarbha recorded nearly 200% more rains than the normal for the day. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a yellow alert for Nagpur district for two days. Nagpur was the second wettest in the region after Bhandara, which recorded more than 34 mm rainfall on Tuesday. The lowest rainfall was received in Akola at 08 mm. Vidarbha, in total, recorded 15.8 mm rains — 199% more than the normal of 5.3 mm, shows the data of Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC), Nagpur. According to the met department, the cause of heavy showers was a low pressure area developed over southern parts of Gangetic West Bengal and neighbourhood with a cyclonic circulation extending upto 5.8 kilometers above mean sea level. “A trough was also running from cyclonic circulation with the above low pressure area to Telangana across interior Odisha,” the officials added. The IMD has forecasted torrential rains for Vidarbha from September 21-24, warning of lightning and heavy rains at some places. The department also warned of high water levels in the dams. “The gates of dams can be opened anytime considering the flood situation.

Manish Shah was hospitalised due to Covid-19 in June 2020. Later, 16 teeth along with his jaw had to be removed after he was infected by black fungus in November. Shah lungs have been transplanted into a 46-year-old patient in Kolkata whose lungs were heavily damaged by coronavirus. It is also the first interstate lung transplant from Gujarat to eastern part of the country. “My husband won the battle against Covid and had recovered from MM too. We knew the painful condition of Covid patients and hence, we agreed to donate the lungs,” said Mona, wife of deceased Shah. On September 16, Shah complained of pain in his hand and head. He was shifted to the hospital for examination and after his condition did not improve, doctors at the United Green Hospital performed angioplasty and placed a stent in his heart. However, within an hour he lost consciousness and doctors diagnosed brain haemorrhage. A surgery was performed to remove a blood clot in his brain, but on September 19 they declared him brain dead. Soon, alerted by the doctors, Nilesh Mandlewala of Donate Life convinced the family to donate his organs. “The family was very kind and agreed to donate the organs. It is the first case of organ donation by Covid-19 patient. All the organs were examined by nodal agencies and were in good condition,” said Mandlewala. Both lungs were transported around 1,625 km away to Kolkata by air in 190 minutes and transplanted in a patient who was on ECMO support for over 103 days. “Manish fought a long battle with Covid and MM. Even in death he gave life to six people,” said Jatin Shah, a cousin of the deceased and senior Surat Urban Development Authority (SUDA). One kidney was donated to 44-year-old resident of Vadodara and another to a 29-year-old resident of Ahmedabad, while the liver was donated to 21-year-old Vadodara resident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/covid-mm-survivors-lungs-give-life-to-kolkata-patient/articleshow/86405383.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

Within a week of the report being published in these columns on September 14, officials of the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) initiated works to complete the civic works and lay the road. Syed Shamsuddin Maghrabi, the citizen reporter who highlighted the issue said, “The road which was left unattended by the civic staff was causing several problems not just to the motorists but also pedestrians in the area. I would like to thank TOI for publishing the grievance and bringing it to the attention of the officials.” Thanking the officials for acting on the report, another resident of the area Sudhansh Kumar said, “They have started the repair works before Ganesh immersion. Most of us were worried that the slow pace of work would cause accidents on the stretch during the immersion processions.” The Mallepally corporator Zafar Khan, who acted immediately on getting the road repaired after the issue was published said, “We had completed laying the road before the immersion day.

According to police, Shakeel was allegedly kidnapped and murdered by his wife’s ex-husband, step-father, brother-in-law and another person in 2010 for marrying her. Additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav acquitted Bijender, Pawan, Taslim Ahmed and Salim in the case and said there were no eyewitnesses in the matter and the body and weapon of offence were not recovered. “The deceased was also involved in various criminal activities. The submissions put forth by defence counsel(s) that the deceased might have been abducted and murdered by his rivals seem probable on this count,” the court said. It added that there was no direct evidence against them, and the case propounded by police was entirely based on circumstantial evidence.

---||Goa||Goa: Hired during second wave peak, Covid workers yet to be paid||PANAJI: A majority of the 430 multi-tasking staff (MTS), who were hired at the height of the second wave of the pandemic and given the arduous task of serving in Covid-19 wards, have not received their first salary even five months later. “We were hoping that we would get paid at least before Ganesh Chaturthi, but barring 40, the rest of us are yet to receive our salaries,” said an MTS posted at GMC’s superspecialty block where Covid-19 patients are treated. MTS were hired for a monthly salary of Rs 17,000. A 25-year-old Satish Naik, who was jobless after completing a course in electronics at ITI, said he decided to work as an MTS in the hope of getting a steady job. “At the time of hiring, we were told that we would be posted in Covid-19 wards. I agreed as I had failed to find regular employment for the past several years. I lifted bodies, placed them in body bags, shifted patients to different wards, and segregated waste, but here I am, still having to beg from others for my daily expenses,” he said. Naik said that when he joined in May, he was posted in Covid-19 wards with nine other MTS. Within days, however, seven quit as they were rattled by the sight of people dying. “During our shift, we had to handle two to three bodies everyday and had to then shift them to a morgue. It’s scarier during the nights, and some could not handle the work,” he said. A colleague of Naik’s who lives in Sattari, said their services haven’t received due recognition when many others were terrified of helping Covid-19 patients. ‘Parents are poor, won’t be able to find another job’“I haven’t even paid the vehicle owner who drops and picks me from the GMC daily,” he said. “Despite not getting paid, I chose not to quit the job as there is no going back for me. My parents are poor. I won’t be able to find another job.” Their contract, he said, was of a six-month duration and extendable by another six months. “There is no guarantee that we will have our jobs next month. We haven’t been paid so far. It is not difficult for them to send us home. We had approached the GMC’s accounts office regarding our salaries but haven’t got a clear answer,” he said. Sangeeta Chodankar, an MTS, does clerical work although she has an MCom, while her colleague has a BA. Both are still awaiting their salaries. Dattaram Sardessai, director of administration at the GMC, said he has already processed the salary papers of all newly recruited MTS and had submitted them to the directorate of accounts prior to Ganesh Chaturthi. He said he was unaware that the MTS were still not paid. “I will have to check. Nobody has approached us so far over non-payment of salaries,” Sardessai said.

---||Hyderabad||‘Merger will bring SCB areas on par with rest of the city’||Hyderabad: Better roads, regular drinking water supply and relief from overflowing drains are some of the primary civic benefits that TOI readers are hopeful of achieving, if the civilian areas under the Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) are merged with the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation. Responding to TOI’s call for their opinion on the merger – the demand for such a move has been gaining momentum of late – majority of the readers said that it should be rolled out without further delay. While some argued that the lack of funds with the SCB has adversely impacted development of areas under its purview, others rued how the belt has fallen behind the rest of the city, when it comes to healthcare and educational infrastructure – both of which, they feel, can be resolved post a merger. Securing permissions, especially for construction purposes, is also a hassle, said a few readers, claiming that SCB officials are highly inaccessible and the process itself is long drawn. The cap on floor space index (FSI) is also a deterrent for many as the board does not allow for high-rises or buildings beyond a certain height. But even as some complain about the closure of defence roads and lack of public parks in the SCB zone, many in favour of the board continuing to operate independently say that it has one of the greenest parts of the city offering a clean and healthy environment to residents to live. Point of view No water, basic infra The Cantonment area lacks basic infrastructure and has no adequate drinking water supply. There are frequent power cuts and colony roads are full of potholes with no proper street lighting. The drainage system is lousy, and it takes only a few heavy spells of rain for the area to get flooded. Through all of this and more, SCB continues to be a mute spectator. Most of the colonies in these areas are self-governed by colony residents as SCB does not have either the manpower or funds to cater to the needs of residents. It is high time SCB merges with GHMC so that developmental works restart in and around Secunderabad. -- K Vinaya Kumar Lack of accountability None of the elected members of the Cantonment are bothered about open nalas passing through its areas. These drains flowing through Bapujinagar and colonies of New Bowenpally pose a serious threat to the health of locals. The cantonment funds are not being properly planned /used for the development of the colonies and there is no accountability. The civil contracts being executed are not up to par with GHMC. Cantonment authorities are not in a position to develop the roads or increase connectivity for the growing population of the area. There is poor development of parks in the Cantonment areas as well. In view of all this, I sincerely feel the government must merge the SCB area with GHMC without further delay. -- J Hanumantha Rao Illegal closure of roads Just a drive through the SCB areas will tell you the backwardness and filthy conditions that residents are in. There is no proper planning of roads and basic amenities and no official to check encroachment of government land. Open drains and dilapidated buildings are the order of the day. There is also the issue of illegal closure of civil roads. And these are just a few of the grievances. This gesture to merge Cantonment with GHMC is a ray of hope for development of the localities and should be implemented as taxpayers of these areas are deprived of basic infrastructure and amenities. -- Raghu Pranay No parks, CCTVs Merging the Cantonment’s civilian areas with GHMC would be a great move as the SCB is showing no interest in developing these pockets and providing facilities like CCTV cameras, regular cleaning of streets, fixing overflowing drains, restoring public parks etc. The restriction on civilians from entering military areas is causing a lot of difficulty for commuters too. Therefore, for the betterment of the area and development with proper facilities, a merger is the best solution. -- Aparna R GSMC could be a solution? Areas beyond Tank Bund have been completely neglected when compared to the phased development of pockets around Hyderabad. Thanks to the IT boom, more attention is now being given to the western corridor and not areas in SCB like Kapra, Sainikpuri, Neredmet, Malkajgiri and others. It is time that SCB gets merged with GHMC. At least after that, areas under SCB and beyond can be developed. Ideally another body, like a Greater Secunderabad Municipal Corporation (GSMC), would go a long way in taking care of Secunderabad and beyond. -- N Nagarajan Complaints unattended While urban discipline is imperative for citizens to enjoy uninterrupted civic facilities, the SCB has always been besieged with administrative problems, thus lagging in providing minimum basic facilities. Besides, SCB has not been doing enough to increase green spaces, lifting garbage regularly and plugging overflowing drains. Developmental works are all perpetually in a standstill mode and despite complaints, issues of people remain unattended here. Further, land sharks here are controlling vacant lands here, creating social unrest and SCB is unable to put an end to this malaise. Resource mobilisation and allocation year after year is also very poor. In view of mounting problems faced by SCB even after revamping the administration, it is imperative to merge it with GHMC to bring development in areas under it on par with the latter with the help of experienced manpower and engineers. -- Srinivasan Ramaswamy Hassle of permissions People living in Cantonment are facing a lot of problems. For example, constructing a house and getting permission for it is a huge task. Then there is the problem of drinking water, even though we are paying more than residents of GHMC areas. There’s also no streetlights, no sanitisation etc. Government benefits like free water are applicable only to GHMC areas. -- V Yadagiri No hospitals, institutes Town planning is the worst in Cantonment. The rules are more stringent and the process of getting things done is very time-consuming. Educational institutions, infrastructure, grounds, stadiums are not developed and accessible to common people. Health infrastructure too is not available here as much as it is available within GHMC. We don't have flyovers, wide roads or other basic facilities. If merged with GHMC, metro rail services can be extended by connecting it to pockets like Quthbullapur, Medchal, Shamirpet, Malkajgiri etc. In all, a merger will lead to overall development of this part of the city. -- Ambala Srinivas FSI restriction The first and foremost benefit of the merger will be with regard to drinking water supply and the FSI rules for construction. Apart from that we can of course expect more slip-roads and soother traffic. We welcome this proposal. -- Venkatapathi Raju Kosuri Relief from taxes We are suffering a lot with the Cantonment board as our living standards are much poorer when compared to GHMC. We would be very happy if the two are merged as it would bring relief in terms of civic amenities, taxes, accessibility and much more. -- R Damodar Mutation a tough task I have been waiting for the mutation of my property, for reconstruction, for the past four years. There is no active response from SCB. They are trying to delay the process until they receive a bribe. The house is in a bad condition. We would not have faced such a problem if we were residing in the municipality. -- M G Alexander Accessibility easier in Cantt I personally feel a merger with GHMC is a bad idea. Accessibility to officials is easier in SCB and officials here are better than their counterparts in GHMC. Having dealt with GHMC officials (in my professional capacity), I feel they are poor at addressing day to day issues like sanitation, garbage clearance, mosquito menace etc. -- P V S Rao High on green, low on corruption Merging SCB with GHMC will be of little help. The GHMC, as of now, is overburdened. When it is failing to cater to the needs of people within its own jurisdiction how can one expect it will serve the people of the SCB area as well? Storm water drains and sewerage are the two biggest problems the city has been facing over the years. Floods during the rainy season have become common. Every year the corporation cites one reason or the other to wash its hand off the matter. There is also more corruption in GHMC. The ultimate of officials there is to fill their coffers. Also, the rate of citizen participation in SCB is highly commendable. As is the case with officials who are working sincerely to maintain the greenery of the area. -- Dr N Ashok Kumar GHMC areas also lack infra It is not like every area under the GHMC has great amenities and civic infrastructure. So, merging SCB with it is not a solution. Instead, what we need to do is make the officials in SCB accountable and ensure they discharge their duties diligently. For instance, there are a lot of multi-storied buildings in SCB that have been constructed without permission. Many have even encroached on the nallas. The concerned officials are ignoring this and not taking action. If they do take proper steps and fine these offenders, they can generate a lot of funds that can then be used to serve the residents in a better way. -- M Surender Kumar||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/merger-will-bring-scb-areas-on-par-with-rest-of-the-city/articleshow/86409564.cms||---

Unfortunately, the forest department fails to project the same level of enthusiasm shown by humans in lion protection as it is yet to repair the fencing on this busiest railway track that had been damaged during the Tauktae cyclone in May. “On September 16, loco pilot S K Sinha spotted four lions on the track between Savarkundla and Mota Liliya sometime around 7.50pm amid the darkness and immediately applied emergency brakes. His alertness and timely action saved the lions,” a statement issued by the railway said. Bhavnagar division of western railway stated that its crew have saved lives of 75 lions since April 2020 by halting trains for hours on this section that has maximum frequency of goods trains owing to the Pipavav port. Nearly 25 trains pass by this route in a day, even amid restricted speed, most of them being goods trains as well as many double decker trains. According to railway authority, there were 52 incidents in 2020-21 and 23 in 2021-22 (till September) of lions trespassing the tracks or were seen close to the tracks. However, according to forest department sources, the fencing it had erected around the railway track to prevent lions straying into train path got badly damaged during the recent cyclone on a 8 to 10 km stretch which has made lion incursions easy on the track.  D T Vasavda chief conservator of forest (wildlife division) told TOI, “I have asked my staff to give me a report about the cyclone damage and based on that we will repair the fence.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/alert-loco-pilots-saved-lives-of-75-lions-in-last-18-months/articleshow/86405546.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

An adult crocodile had crawled up right to the ornate door of the Laxmi Vilas Palace at about 2am. The eight-foot-long reptile growled as it looked for the way out of the place.  “A security guard spotted the crocodile and informed us. We rushed to the spot immediately and began the rescue operation,” said a forest official. The team had to rescue the crocodile with care to ensure that it didn’t climb the steps of the palace from the northern side. It took the volunteers half-an-hour to rescue the crocodile.  “It had ventured out of Vishwamitri River that flows behind the palace. The river water is flowing very fast due to the rains so the reptile must have got out and was looking for some other waterbody,” the official added. During monsoons, many crocodiles venture out of Vishwamitri River and migrated to nearby ponds. Forest officials said that sometimes the younger crocodiles also migrate to other locations. In another incident, the Gujarat Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (GSPCA) rescued a crocodile from residential area in Kalali on Monday.The five-and-a-half-foot long reptile had ventured into an artificial pond at an under-construction site. The volunteers first emptied some water from the pond and then rescued the crocodile. Earlier, a three-feet-long crocodile had ventured into Khaswadi crematorium and it was rescued by the GSPCA and Wildlife SOS volunteers. Two days ago, a three-feet-long crocodile was rescued from an artificial pond made for Ganesh idol immersion in Navlakhi Compound.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/crocodile-knocks-on-vadodara-palace-doors/articleshow/86405067.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Readers Corner-Call friends, relatives every Sunday||By H V N Raj When we buy a new vehicle, we are given three-four vouchers for free service, for the next six months or so. We invariably remember this, block the date, book the slot and take the vehicle to the garage for servicing. Even though a vehicle is a materialistic thing, we are concerned enough to take it for service regularly. Then why is it that we are so careless about our mind and body? Why do we ignore getting regular health checkups and wait for things to go south to rush for medical help? Is prevention not better than cure? This is the first and most important new normal that I have embraced -- regular health checkups for me and my family -- in this post pandemic world. There are other things that I have adapted too. Helping others whenever I can, maintaining a daily routine, getting adequate sleep, being physically active, practicing relaxation exercises like meditation etc. One of the most important practices of all, which I adopted as the new normal is making personal calls to all elders in the family (brothers, sisters and their families) and even the youngsters -- relatives and friends -- every Sunday without fail and asking about their well-being. This has brought all the family members and friends closer. Lastly, taking inspiration from my son-in-law, me and my wife have painted the walls of the house to give it a new look, which made us look towards the brighter side of life.

---||Lucknow||11 dengue cases: Highest single-day spike in Lucknow||LUCKNOW: In the highest single-day spike this season, 11 confirmed and 15 suspected cases of dengue were reported in the city on Tuesday. With these cases, the tally of confirmed dengue cases in the district has reached 193 this year. Of these, 120 (62%) have been reported in September alone. The number does not include suspected cases, many of which are being reported at private hospitals. The surge witnessed in the past three days has come after Thursday’s heavy downpour which left many areas heavily waterlogged. Water accumulation has not been cleaned in many localities and has turned into a safe haven for mosquitoes. Health authorities fear that if immediate action is not taken by civic agencies, cases of mosquito-borne disease may rise further. The new cases were confirmed through ELISA test at Balrampur hospital. The patients are from Balaganj, Triveninagar, Takrohi, Khadara, Para, Aashiana and rural areas. Two patients were admitted due to low platelet count, but are stable. Other patients including a seven-year-old and three teenagers were given medicines and are recuperating at home, said a senior official at the hospital. Besides, 15 suspected cases—11 at Lokbandhu hospital and four at SPM Civil hospital—tested positive for dengue through the ‘card test’. Their samples have been sent for confirmatory ELISA test. Two patients at Lokbandhu hospital were serious, while others were sent home with medication. Aedes larvae found in 29 houses:Health department teams found larvae of Aedes aegypti mosquito, the carrier of dengue virus, at 29 houses in its ongoing drive in Faizullaganj, Alamnagar, Daliganj, Niralanagar and Aliganj localities. At most places, larvae were found in flower pots, broken objects on the roof and in coolers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/1-1-dengue-cases-highest-single-day-spike/articleshow/86411143.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 1st free memory clinic for patients with dementia||MUMBAI: The city’s first free memory clinic for patients with dementia was inaugurated at BMC-run KEM Hospital in Parel on the occasion of World Alzheimer’s Day 2021 on Tuesday. In the near future, the hospital plans to set up a day-care facility for dementia patients where their caregivers could drop them off for the day. “Families are small these days and caregivers of Alzheimer’s patients at times find it difficult to attend work. Such a day-care would help affected families,’’ said BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani at the opening of the memory clinic. The clinic will focus on the much-needed rehabilitation for senior citizens diagnosed with dementia, said KEM Hospital’s head of neurology Dr Sangeeta Rawat. At present, such patients who visit public hospitals are only given medications. “The much-needed mental rehabilitation in the form of memory games or puzzles and physiotherapy has been missing. We will now be able to offer it to patients with dementia,’’ said neuro psychologist Dr Urvashi Shah. KEM Hospital treats 10-15 new patients with dementia every week. “We will have around 200 patients following up with us,’’ added Dr Rawat. A memory clinic has experts from various specialties to diagnose and offer “holistic’’ care, including medication, psycho-education, psycho-social support and physical rehabilitation. Due to the growing burden of dementia in society, the doctors felt there was an urgent need to set up a memory clinic in the public system. The Dementia India Report 2010 estimated that the burden of dementia would grow by 80% from 2.77 lakh in 2006 to 5 lakh in 2021. An estimated 5 million patients in India suffer from dementia and there are fears that the number could double by 2030. KEM hospital dean Dr Hemant Deshmukh said the memory clinic is a much-needed intervention for dementia. “We will not only look at setting up a day-care centre but even carry out interventions in old age homes,’’ he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-1st-free-memory-clinic-for-patients-with-dementia/articleshow/86411174.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Termination of rape survivor’s pregnancy stuck||Lucknow: A 14-year-old Dalit rape survivor from Lakhimpur Kheri, whose unwarranted pregnancy was ordered to be terminated by the high court on September 14, was on Tuesday referred to Queen Mary’s Hospital in Lucknow. Examined by a team of doctors at the district women’s hospital in Lakhimpur Kheri on Tuesday, the minor was found to be 22 weeks, 3 days pregnant with complications. She was expected to reach Lucknow by late Tuesday night. The girl, allegedly raped by a relative who is now in jail, was found to be 16 weeks pregnant in August when she complained of stomach ache and was taken to the doctor. “An FIR was lodged in the case. After we approached the high court, the order to medically terminate the unwarranted pregnancy was given. Since the family’s financial condition is unsound, the court further observed that all treatment and procedures will be done free of cost,” said lawyers Haider Rizvi, Nadeem Murtaza and Aditya Vikram Singh. A court-appointed medical board gave details of the pregnancy and said the minor is physically weak. TOI has a copy of the report. The court had also said that the unwanted pregnancy was a cause of constant trauma for the girl. “Since the September 14 order, we kept asking the Kheri chief medical officer to form the team for investigation, but things got delayed. Every day counts for the girl now. If the hospital had informed us it was inept in following through with the process, we could have sought a pregnancy termination order for Lucknow and not wasted time,” said Rizvi. When TOI spoke to KGMU vice-chancellor Lt Gen (retd) Dr Bipin Puri and Queen Mary’s Hospital medical superintendent Prof SP Jaiswar, they assured full cooperation in the case. “Since it is a medico-legal case, we will have to follow protocol and get examination done at our facility too. We will do our best possible to help the girl,” said Dr Puri.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/termination-of-rape-survivors-pregnancy-stuck/articleshow/86411195.cms||Yusra Husain

Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, said the consistent supply of vaccines gave the much necessary boost to the vaccination drive in September. He said the Pune district was getting a healthy number of vaccines compared to other districts because of its consistent performance. The district is inching closer to administering one crore doses. Till Tuesday, the total vaccine doses administered in the district was 98.99 lakh. Of them, 68.81 lakh were first doses and 30.17 lakh were the second. “Our instructions are clear to all the units — exhaust vaccines at the earliest to get the new stock. Now that Pune rural is exhausting and vaccinating more number of people, we are allotting them more doses. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) comes second,” Deshmukh said, adding that Solapur and Satara districts under the Pune circle of the state health services had also improved their vaccination count.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/over-1-lakh-beneficiaries-get-jabs-in-pune-district/articleshow/86408961.cms||---

The IMD said Pune city is likely to experience light to moderate rainfall, with heavy spells in the ghat section of the district till Thursday, after that partly cloudy conditions with isolated very light to light rain will persist. Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather forecasting at IMD Pune, told TOI that a trough from cyclonic circulation over east Rajasthan to northeast Arabian sea across Gujarat was affecting weather in Maharashtra. “This is causing vigorous monsoon conditions in north Konkan and north Madhya Maharashtra. The system is likely to persist for three days,” Kashyapi. In addition, other systems causing rains include a monsoon trough to the south of its normal position and strong westerly winds blowing from the Arabian Sea, pulling moisture into Maharashtra. Further, Kashyapi said a low-pressure area over the southern parts of Gangetic West Bengal and neighbourhood, with the associated cyclonic circulation extending up to middle tropospheric levels tilting south-westwards, was causing rains in Vidarbha. “This system is likely to weaken in a few days and move west-north-westwards as a cyclonic circulation across north Odisha, north Chhattisgarh and north Madhya Pradesh in the subsequent three days,” Kashyapi said. “By 1pm on Tuesday, huge masses of clouds were seen over Mumbai, which travelled towards Pune. So, there are chances of light to moderate rains in Pune city. Rains in Maharashtra, however, will lose steam after Thursday,” Kashyapi said. For September 22, heavy rain at isolated places has been forecast for Palghar, Mumbai, Thane and Raigad; thunderstorm accompanied by lightning/gusty winds and heavy rain at isolated places in Dhule, Nandurbar, Aurangabad, Jalna, Parbhani, Beed, Hingoli, Nanded, Latur, and Osmanabad; and a warning of thunderstorm with lightning, gusty winds and heavy rain at isolated places in ghat areas of Nashik, Pune and Satara.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/heavy-rain-alert-in-parts-of-state-today-lull-from-friday/articleshow/86421278.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Soon, get permission to cut trees online||PANAJI: After the high court of Bombay at Goa expressed shock that tree authorities for North and South Goa had not met since their constitution in 2012, the authorities held a joint meeting based on court directives. A compliance report, as directed by the court, was filed, where it has been stated that the forest department is in the process of developing a dedicated online portal for applications seeking permissions for tree felling across Goa. However, the state has told the court that it is not feasible to carry out a tree census in Goa as directed by the court, as it is a ‘herculean’ task and Goa’s climate leads to dense vegetation growth within a short time. “Once the online portal is operational, the entire process of tree felling (permissions) will be online,” it said. Presently, the forest department on a regular basis is uploading the permissions granted for tree felling on the forest department’s website,” reads the compliance report submitted by member secretaries of the tree authorities, Santosh Fadte and Prem Kumar R. In July, the high court had directed the state to comply with all provisions related to the duties of the tree authority under the Goa, Daman and Diu Preservation of Trees Act. The court was hearing a public interest litigation filed by Living Heritage Foundation, that had sought the revival of the tree authority and the carrying out of a tree census. About the census, the tree authorities have said in the compliance report that the Forest Surveys of India, a body of the Union environment ministry, has already surveyed the forest and tree cover in Goa. As per the 2019 report, Goa’s forest cover increased from 60.2% during the previous survey year to 60.4%. “In order to plan and carry out a census of trees over an area of approximately 2,487sq km is a herculean and voluminous exercise, requiring a large number of technical/skilled manpower, logistics, IT equipment, funds etc,” the compliance report reads. If a census is taken up, it will be difficult to arrive at a fixed figure of trees as the growth of a tree is a continuous process, the report states. “It will keep on changing after every year, and therefore the tree census shall have to be carried out at regular intervals, which is an enormous task in terms of time and resources. Further, climatic conditions of Goa facilitate quick growth of forest-like vegetation as it is a high rainfall zone,” reads the report. The Forest Survey of India already has records of trees outside of forest areas, the report states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/soon-get-permission-to-cut-trees-online/articleshow/86411169.cms||---

---||India||No change in DoB at fag end of service: SC||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday held that a person cannot claim as a matter of right to get his or her date of birth changed if the application is made after inordinate delay and more particularly when it is made at the fag end of service or when the employee is about to retire on attaining the age of superannuation. A bench of Justices M R Shah and A S Bopanna said the plea for change in date of birth by an employee can be rejected in such cases even if there is “cogent evidence” as allowing such plea could result in a chain reaction and others below him, waiting for years for their promotion, would get affected. Referring to various judgements delivered by the apex court on the issue of change in date of birth, the bench said, “The law on change of date of birth can be summarised as under: (i) application for change of date of birth can only be as per the relevant provisions/regulations applicable; (ii) even if there is cogent evidence, the same cannot be claimed as a matter of right; (iii) application can be rejected on the ground of delay and more particularly when it is made at the fag end of service and/or when the employee is about to retire on attaining the age of superannuation.” The court set aside the order of the Karnataka HC which had allowed the plea of a government employee for change in date of birth which he had sought 24 years after joining the service. The employee had sought change of date of birth from January 04, 1960 to January 24,1961.He had first filed a suit in lower court which was rejected but the HC passed order in his favour and his service got extended by one year. The HC granted him relief on the ground that he was not aware of the rule that he had to apply for change of date of birth within three years after a 1974 law was adopted by the organisation in 1991.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-change-in-dob-at-fag-end-of-service-sc/articleshow/86414264.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary
---||Nagpur||Foam floats down with rain near Chanda mine, power plant; greens blame high pollution||Chandrapur: Atmospheric pollution at the higher level during dense cloudy conditions triggered a weird phenomenon of foam pouring down along with rain near Durgapur opencast mine, on the outskirts of the city on Tuesday afternoon, said experts. There was panic for some time among the people as they had never witnessed such a weird phenomenon. Flakes of foam continued to pour down with rain for nearly an hour. Environment experts have blamed excessive emission of pollutants from the stacks of Chandrapur Super Thermal Power Station (CSTPS) for the foam downpour, and have formally lodged a complaint with the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) here. Dark clouds loomed over the city and around since early in the morning on Tuesday, and it started raining heavily at around 10am. Many workers in WCL Durgapur mine, located around 4km north of the city, and commuters along Durgapur road witnessed the weird phenomenon of foam flakes floating down with rain at around 2pm. Thousands of balls of foam came floating down like parachutes in the rain. The downpour of foam continued for around an hour, till the rain lasted. The bubbles in the foam were so thick that they did not dissipate immediately after touching the ground, but remained intact for several minutes, said a witness. Environmentalist proffessor Yogeshwar Dudhpachare rushed to the spot on getting information and video recorded the event. “I smelled and tasted the foam. It was oily and salty in taste. We took a sample of foam to the MPCB office and filed a formal complaint about the weird phenomenon,” he said. He claimed CSTPS is just two kilometers from the place and it is likely that emission from its stack might have triggered the weird phenomenon. Professor Dr Sachin Wazalwar claimed that the phenomenon might have occurred due to surfactant effect of chemicals mixing with the clouds. The chemicals released due to incomplete combustion or recombination of gases may also cause the surfactant effect, leading to the downpour of foam from clouds. Surfactant effect or micelle formation may be caused due to many factors which are released through industrial stacks. It is unlikely anything else from the surface would have gone to such heights to mix with clouds, he said. Regional officer, MPCB Chandrapur, Ashok Kare claimed that a team of two field officers and a scientist has been rushed to the spot to collect sample foam for chemical analysis. Proper investigations would be carried out into the odd phenomenon and its cause, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/foam-floats-down-with-rain-near-chanda-mine-power-plant-greens-blame-high-pollution/articleshow/86409012.cms||Mazhar Ali
---||Ahmedabad||Urgently protect pride of Asia: Gujarat high court||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Tuesday said that Asiatic lions are not only the pride of Gujarat, but of entire Asia and prompt measures are expected from the government to protect the wild cats. The court urged all authorities operating in the Gir sanctuary to look after the lions’ safety. The bench of Justice N V Anjaria and Justice A P Thaker called for the protection of the big cats. The court was seeking a reply from the railways and the state government on the proposed project of gauge conversion of tracks in the Gir sanctuary. The court sought a reply in response to amicus curiae Hemang Shah’s report and his demand for the cancellation of the proposal to allot 150 hectare forest land to the railways for the upgrade of tracks to broad gauge and their electrification. Asking the railways to make its stand clear on the proposed project in the sanctuary, the high court sought details about the existing railway lines and the frequency of trains. The court also wanted to know the number of passengers ferried daily and the accidents involving lions and trains. The railways will also have to state the possible effect of the track upgrade on wildlife, particularly lions. The court has been hearing a suo motu PIL for the conservation of lions in and around the Gir sanctuary. This is in the backdrop of the state government informing the assembly three years ago that 184 lions had died in the previous two years. During the hearing, the bench said: “Asiatic lions are not only the pride of Gujarat, but the pride of entire Asia. Prompt measures are expected from the government to protect the wild cats.” It went on to say: “We reiterate that such measures are expected not only from the state government but also from all authorities which operate in the sanctuary area.” The amicus curiae has filed an application taking exception to the proposals of track conversion and electrification, laying down of oil and gas pipelines through the Gir sanctuary buffer zone, and laying fibre optic cables. The application, filed earlier this year, cited news reports and demanded the immediate withdrawal of the projects. The high court inquired with the state government about its stand on gauge conversion and electrification. The government pleader submitted that the proposal is at a nascent stage. The railways had only placed the proposal before the State Board for Wildlife (SBWL), which forwarded it to the state government. The proposal has been returned to the SBWL for reconsideration because certain issues were not addressed at all. “The state is protector of the lions. It is responsible for the sanctuary. The state government’s opinion (on the railways’ proposal) is absolutely mandatory,” the government pleader assured the court. “The proposal will go to the Centre only after every aspect is minutely considered. But we have not taken an opinion because the stage has not come.” The pleader added: “Till the SBWL reconsiders our remarks, it will not move forward.” The high court has asked the state government and the railways to file affidavits on the subject by October 12.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/urgently-protect-pride-of-asia-hc/articleshow/86409034.cms||---

---||Delhi||9-year-old’s rape-murder: Delhi court’s no to daily hearings||NEW DELHI: Citing huge pendency of Pocso cases, a Delhi court on Tuesday said it would not be possible for it to hear on a day-to-day basis the case of alleged gang-rape and murder of a nine-year-old dalit girl that had taken place in Delhi Cantonment. Additional Sessions Judge Ashutosh Kumar dismissed the plea moved by police seeking expeditious hearing in the matter. The court said there were about 620 pending cases, including this one, and several accused in those matters were in judicial custody. Police had submitted that the girl allegedly suffocated to death during sexual assault by the accused, Radhey Shyam, a crematorium priest, and the body was forcefully cremated to wipe out evidence. Four people were chargesheeted under IPC, Pocso Act and SC/ST Act. The court, however, added that the matter would be decided expeditiously. “In view of the huge pendency before this court and submissions of the defence counsel that he has to attend to other matters, day-to-day hearing will not be possible,” the judge said. The chargesheet was filed by police in this case within 30 days, as directed by Union home minister Amit Shah. Additional Public Prosecutor Yadvinder Singh, appearing for police, said fast-tracking the case would bring justice to the victim’s family. Advocate LK Verma, appearing for Shyam, opposed the police’s plea saying arguments on charges could only begin after evidence of rape of the minor girl was submitted in the supplementary chargesheet. “There are so many Pocso cases. Why is police trying to fast-track this case only? The chargesheet was filed within a month, but rape is yet to be proved. The accused deserve a fair trial too,” he said. The lawyer further stated he would not be able to come to the hearing daily as he also had to attend to other cases. Meanwhile, the court also sought a reply from the DCP concerned and jail authorities on an application moved by Shyam alleging physical assault on him in jail and while he was being brought to court in the police van. The application sought the court’s directions to the investigating officer and jail authorities to provide protection to him in jail and a separate police van during court production. “The life of the applicant (Shyam) is in danger as some co-prisoners beat him in jail as well as while travelling to the court in the police van. He is regularly threatened to be killed,” alleged the application.

The victim, Ajay Yadav, was a history-sheeter as per the Sadar police station and enjoyed considerable political patronage. He was killed on the spot while his aide, who was accompanying him, fled in a hail of bullets. DCP (west) Richa Tomar said one bullet hit Yadav’s arm while another was lodged in his thigh. Five shells of different calibres and a magazine lay scattered in a 50-metre area around the crime scene. As per police and locals, the incident happened as follows. Yadav was sitting in his Scorpio SUV after meeting his friend Rohit. His SUV was parked alongside a cluster of tea and snack shacks. Yadav frequented these shops for chatting with his friends and locals. At least six heavily armed men on two scooters arrived shortly after 1.10pm. Together they charged at the vehicle, firing multiple rounds which shattered the SUV’s glass windows. As the volley of gunshots rang out, Yadav and his friend Saurav fled to different directions. The firing now spilled out into the streets as the accused chased Yadav and fired intermittently. With a bleeding arm, Yadav desperately tried to hide behind rows of benches and chairs before assailants outran him. They caught him by his clothes and dragged him about 10 metres to an iron bench behind a tea shack where they killed him with a heavy stone. His head was found buried about threeinch deep into the muddy soil. Police suspect one of the assailant’s firearms may have jammed due to which the magazine fell to the ground. Yadav was taken to a hospital where he was declared dead.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/history-sheeter-shot-and-killed-with-stone-near-bani-park-colony/articleshow/86411249.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Death better than life with tarnished image, says Narendra Giri’s suicide note||LUCKNOW: The 14-page handwritten suicide note recovered from the room in which the body of Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad (ABAP) president Mahant Narendra Giri was found on Monday, has thrown up some unanswered questions about the circumstances under which the seer breathed his last. In the suicide note, purportedly written by Mahant Narendra Giri, the seer specifically accuses his disciple Anand Giri, and two others, Adhya Tewari and his son Sandeep Tewari, of subjecting him to mental harassment and forcing him to end his life. The note urges Prayagraj police and administrative officials to ensure that the accused get punished. The page 5 of the suicide note states that on September 13, Narendra Giri was planning to commit suicide but could not muster courage. He was under extreme mental stress after he was “informed from Haridwar” that Anand Giri was planning to upload on social media his morphed video clip with a girl or a woman in an objectionable condition. “ Sachchai to logon ko baad me jayegi lekin main to badnam ho jaunga, isiliye main atmahatya karne jaa raha hoon jiske zimmedar Anand Giri , Adhya Tiwari aur unka ladka Sandeep Tiwari honge (Truth will eventually prevail but by then my image would get tarnished. Therefore, I am going to commit suicide and Anand Giri, Adhya Tewari and his son Sandeep Tiwari would be responsible for it),” the suicide note reads. Last paragraph on page number 8 speaks about two transactions of Rs 25 lakh each involving some Aditya Mishra and Shailendra Singh. On page 9, the seer has written that he is taking the step on his own will. “Anand Giri ne mere upar asatya, mithya aur mangadhant aarop lagaye, tab se main maansik dabaav mein jee raha hoon (Ever since Anand Giri levelled fake allegations against me, I am living under mental stress),” the seer wrote and added that whenever he was alone, he thought of commiting suicide. A major portion of the suicide note speaks of the Mahant’s wish on who should get which part of the mutt’s property. Narendra Giri also expressed his ‘last wish’ regarding his ‘samadhi’ which should come up next to that of his ‘ guru’ (mentor). The note says that a lemon tree be planted near his samadhi. In the letter, the seer named his disciple Balbir Giri as the new chief of ABAP. The note, written on the official letter head of the ABAP president Mahant Narendra Giri, starts with a blank page. The second sheet marked as (2) carries the date ‘13-9-2021’ which has been cut and ‘20-9-2021’ is written above it. While the entire note in written in dark ink, some corrections have been made with a different pen. Every page of the note has ‘Mahant Narendra Giri’ written at the bottom of the page.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/death-better-than-life-with-tarnished-image-narendra-giris-suicide-note/articleshow/86411241.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Bus catches fire, close shave for 35 passengers||PUNE: Around 35 passengers on board a private bus to Mumbai from Mahabaleshwar had a narrow escape when it suddenly caught fire near the Ozarde village in Lonavla early in the morning on September 19. “The driver realized there was a snag as a fire broke out in the engine compartment of the bus. He stopped the bus on the service lane and all the passengers were told to get down from the bus,” superintendent of police (HSP) Sanjay Jadhav told TOI. Within minutes the entire vehicle was in flames. Police and the fire brigade were informed about the incident, but the bus had completely burnt by the time the flames were doused. “The fire brigade and ambulances reached the spot. A fire brigade team doused off the flames within 20 minutes. No one was injured in the accident,” he said. “Prima facie inspection revealed that the fire broke out after a short circuit in the engine section,” Jadhav said. The officer said the short circuit posed questions on the maintenance aspect of the buses. “It is important to maintain the long distance buses frequently as they cover many kilometres each day. Many private buses have been off roads for months together because of the lockdowns and only recently has the transportation started. The cost of bringing a bus back on the road in perfect shape is between Rs1 lakh and Rs1.5 lakh. With many transporters facing severe losses, many of them have ignored the maintenance aspect, which is dangerous,” a Pune-based private bus operator said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bus-catches-fire-close-shave-for-35-passengers/articleshow/86409040.cms||---

As per the rules, the authorities are supposed to reserve 7% quota for SC candidates. The PIL was filed by Banaskantha Jilla Dalit Sangathan pointing out to the Board’s recent recruitment advertisement for a total of 1,382 posts of armed and unarmed police sub-inspectors, sub-inspectors and intelligence officers. Petitioner’s advocates Nirali Oza and Anurag Rathod pointed out that of the 1,382 posts, only 71 were reserved for SC candidates. Only one post has been reserved for SC as against total 300 vacancies for unarmed PSIs, only two posts for SC candidates as against total 72 vacancies for posts of armed PSIs.

Petitioner Sadukar Hatwar had prayed for declaration of Sawarkar’s victory as null and void under Section 100(1)(d)(i) of the Representation Act. He contended that the MLA’s nomination was improperly accepted by the returning officer. He alleged that Sawarkar, in his affidavit, had suppressed the names of his dependents, their assets, his assets and liabilities, bank account numbers, mortgage of properties and various loans. Justice Pushpa Ganediwala however, clarified that the petitioner’s pleadings do not satisfy stringent requirements of Section 83(1)(a) of the Act, on the backdrop of law laid down by the Supreme Court. “This petition needs to be nipped in the bud, being a vexatious litigation, without having any cause of action. It stands rejected under Order 7 Rule 11(a) of the Code of Civil Procedure with costs.” The judge pointed out that there are no details regarding the source of the petitioner’s information and data, and no reference is made to any official source for such figures, thereby showing the vague nature of pleadings, which do not state any material facts. “Upon traversing the entire petition and applying requirements of law, this court has come to the conclusion that cause of action has not been made out by the petitioner even for considering going to trial. The failure to place even a single material fact amounts to disobedience of the mandate of Section 83(1)(a),” the judge said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-dismisses-plea-against-kamptee-mlas-election/articleshow/86409051.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

---||Nagpur||Feeling ditched by state govt, resident doctors to go on strike on Oct 1||Nagpur: Resident doctors in the government medical colleges across the state were assured about the tuition fee waiver by the State government during the second wave of Covid-19. But, the government has still not waived off any fees. Many resident doctors who worked hard during the Covid-19 have already completed their PG and still awaiting the fee waiver. The Central Committee of the Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) has decided to resort to a state-wide strike on October 1. “Medical education minister Amit Deshmukh had assured about the tuition fee waiver, special Covid allowance and better hostels for the resident doctors in July and August. We have been following up the demand since then. But virtually, no progress has happened in this issue in last 45 days,” said Dr Dnyaneshwar Dhobale Patil, President of central committee of MARD. Resident doctors told TOI that the medical education ministry has given in-principle approval to their demands subject to the approval from the Finance ministry headed by Ajit Pawar. The delegation of resident doctors met Pawar in August. “Finance minister had assured us that he will clear the file as soon as he receives it from the medical education department. But, the file is still not reached the finance department. This made us think that the government is deliberately delaying the just demand of Covid warriors just because the pandemic is well under control now and our services are no more needed,” said Dr Dhobale. The central committee has decided to send one last reminder to the government this week and then resort to a state-wide strike on October 1. Resident doctors are considered as backbone of the government hospitals in state. As they have lost their academic years, studies and practical exposure during last two years due to Covid-19 pandemic, they are demanding tuition fee waiver. Meanwhile, entire batch of resident doctors has completed their post graduation (PG) and pass-out from the university. “We don’t know how we will be getting the benefit of fee waiver as we have already completed our PG. This is an insult to the Covid warriors,” said a MARD member who has recently completed MD pediatrics.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/feeling-ditched-by-state-govt-resident-doctors-to-go-on-strike-on-oct-1/articleshow/86409120.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

The group not only abused Prasad Ranjan, who is the nephew of Deshabandhu Chittaranjan Das, and his wife, but also broke their household items, apparently in an attempt to intimidate them. Prasad and Malabasree, who has retired from the state I&C department, were visiting her father’s place near Asutosh College in Bhowanipore when the incident took place. The extortion attempt, as claimed by Das, lasted for close to three hours. “Despite cops from the Bhowanipore police station reacting immediately and sending a force, the group continued to hurl abuses at me. The police asked me to go inside the house and that infuriated the group members who foul-mouthed the cops as well,” claimed Prasad Ranjan. “The local police will take necessary action,” said joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma.  According to Prasad Ranjan, he and his wife were at his in-laws’ home when the doorbell rang around 9am. “My wife opened the door and before she could react, three transgenders pushed her aside and barged in. They even shut the door behind them. Then they asked us to show the baby. I was taken aback. I tried telling them that I was an aged person and both my son and daughter were settled in other cities. My wife, unaware of their plans, asked them whether they were talking about our grandchild, who was born in Mumbai. The moment she said it, they pounced on it and demanded Rs 51,000. They demanded we give them our daughter’s current address or that of her in-laws, who live in Kolkata. When we refused, they started threatening us and then, went inside the dining room, where they hurled bowls and kettles to intimidate us. This was a rude shock for me,” he said. He called the police. “The cops responded but that angered the group even more. They now threatened assault and used using abusive language. The cops asked me to go inside, promising to remove them. It took the cops close to one-and-a-half hours to bring the situation under control. As a descendant of the Das family, which has made innumerable contributions to this nation, this was something that we were not ready for. I believe it was just an attempt at extortion before the Pujas. They thought senior citizens would give in to their hooliganism,” Prasad Ranjan said. A senior officer of Kolkata Police said they are aware of the issue but could seldom act like that in other extortion cases. Sometimes, the transgenders ganged up and created trouble outside police stations, he said. “Once a gang of 200 transgenders raided the Lake police station, when the officers had interfered in a similar case. But such cases can be handled if people lodge complaints,” said the officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/transgenders-hold-south-kolkata-family-to-ransom-demand-rs-51000/articleshow/86409113.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

---||Mumbai||Gangster Ashwin Naik, 7 others acquitted in 2015 extortion case||Mumbai: A sessions court on Tuesday acquitted alleged gangster Ashwin Naik and seven other accused of all charges in an extortion and organised crime case lodged against them by a builder in 2015, with the Dadar police.Naik’s counsel Prakash Shetty argued that there was no evidence of any extortion as alleged and it was “a totally cooked up case”. Special trial court judge R R Bhosale in his verdict said, “The accused — Ashwin Naik, Pramod Keluskar, Prathamesh Parab, Janardan Sakpal, Rajesh Tambe, Avinash Khedkar, Milind Parab and Suraj Pal — are acquitted of the offences under IPC sections 364-A of IPC (kidnapping for ransom), 384 (extortion), 387 (extortion with fear of death) and criminal conspiracy as well as under the Arms Act and the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act.” All the accused were in prison during trial and shall be released forthwith, if not required in any other case, directed the court. The prosecution case argued by special public prosecutor J V Desai was that Naik would threaten developers wanting to carry out construction in Dadar of dire consequences unless they paid him money. In his complaint to the police, the builder said that fearing Naik, none of the developers ever approached police. He said Naik had demanded Rs 50 lakh from him and 6,000 sqft space in his proposed construction. Shetty, however, argued that it was a “false case foisted on the accused by the builder to grab the plot of land under the occupation and possession of Naik’s family and to put him behind bars.” The reasoned judgment will be available later. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/gangster-ashwin-naik-7-others-acquitted-in-2015-extortion-case/articleshow/86412672.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Nishad Party announces trust in Phoolan Devi’s name||LUCKNOW: In his bid to claim Phoolan Devi’s legacy in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh, Nishad Party president Dr Sanjay Nishad visited the ‘Samadhi Sthal’ of the ‘bandit queen’ in Mirzapur’s Chaubeghat area on Tuesday. He also announced setting up an international trust in the name of former Samajwadi Party MP, who hailed from the Nishad community. “I would also appeal to the central and the state governments to order a highlevel inquiry to ascertain the status of her property after her death. Her mother lives in a pitiable condition in Jalaun,” said the Nishad Party chief. Phoolan Devi was shot outside her residence in Delhi on July 25, 2001 when she was the SP MP from Mirzapur. The political parties observe July 25 as her `Shahadat Diwas’ every year. However, the functions held in her memory this year had been different as the political parties did not merely stop at that. While the Nishad party chief said that a self-defence training centre for women would be set up in Mirzapur once the party comes in power, the Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) had planned to install 18-feet statues of the late leader in 18 districts on her 'martyrdom' day. The police, however, foiled the plan and seized dozens of statues brought from Bihar by party workers. Later, party president Mukesh Sahni, a minister in the NDA government in Bihar, said that the party would install the statues once it comes to power in the state. The party referred to her as a ‘Veerangana’ (brave woman) and took a line, “Phoolan abhi zinda hai, hamare aur aapke vichaaron mein, Mata Bahno ke sangharshon mein.” The pamphlet that the VIP had printed on her ‘Shahadat Diwas’ mentioned that she was put to non-stop harassment by a ‘specific community’ in the village but she “did not bow down” and eventually made her way to the parliament. The Nishad-centric parties also harp on the fact that the Time Magazine had put her as the fourth most revolutionary woman in the world in the list of 16 women.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/nishad-party-announces-trust-in-phoolans-name/articleshow/86411280.cms||Neha Shukla

Majority of the students in government schools continue to struggle to get access to computers and mobile phones to participate in their lessons. Taking cognisance of the situation, an academic from The Netherlands has set up information and communication technology (ICT)-enables spaces at seven government schools to provide children in villages access to digital learning tools. Arti Gupta had initially launched two ICT centres in Muttatti and Hyknur in T Narasipura taluk two years ago as a pilot project. The initiative was subsequently extended to five more schools, including the government higher primary school, Varakodu. The ICT centre has five computers, connected to internet. Project head of Pratham Mysore Jagadish said that Arti had conceived of the idea of learning spaces. “A year-and-a-half ago, Arti visited five government schools, and decided to set up the ICT centre at the Varakodu school after considering the many parameters including the facilities and interest among the schoolteachers,” Jagadish said. Pratham Mysore is the implementation and monitoring partner under the ‘Learning Space’ initiative. “Curiosity, collaboration and creativity are the ideas behind the initiative. The facilitator helps the students lead their lessons using the digital modules,” Jagadish added. In addition to helping rural students participate in online classes, ‘Learning Spaces’ provides books, and endeavours to improve creativity and critical thinking among students by providing them with puzzles and other similar activities. An effusive Arti Gupta said that the environment that the headmaster of the Varakodu school Narasimha Murthy had created for the children left her spellbound. “Learning Spaces is about providing the right environment so children flourish, and an enduring association with Narasimha Murthy seemed natural,” she said. Murthy said that the school in Varakodu had a strength of 150 students in classes from I to VII, taught by seven teachers. “Our goal is to familiarise the students with digital learning. Nearly 50 students from private schools joined out institution owing to the various initiatives undertaken here,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/ict-enabled-spaces-help-govt-school-students-bridge-digital-divide/articleshow/86406909.cms||Shrinivasa M

The rally had begun from Assam and reached UP’s Maharajganj district on September 15. The CM praised SSB for its work of patrolling India’s border with Nepal and spoke about the importance of celebrating India’s independence so that the youth is aware of the sacrifices made by freedom fighters. NCC cadets participate in 'Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav' programme on Tuesday“SSB should not be looked at as just a force but recognised for its services in protecting the country and also maintaining relations with local people. It has been patrolling the Indo-Nepal border since 2001. UP shares a border of around 600km with Nepal. SSB has established itself as a capable force and has focused on human intelligence,” the CM said. With ‘Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav’ being celebrated all year, Yogi said it was necessary to explain to the current generation what the cost of independence has been. Expressing gratitude to freedom fighters, he said that everyone must derive inspiration from their sacrifices. “Under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, we are also organising the centenary celebrations of the Chauri Chaura incident combined with that of the 75th year of independence. Special programmes are being held at all sites connected with the independence movement,” the CM said. He also mentioned how, meeting the PM’s target for each state to sign an MoU with another to strengthen cultural relations, UP had signed MoUs with Maharashtra, Assam, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh. “These MoUs will help in realising the PM’s dream of a unified India. Now, on national festivals, cultural teams from each state visit each other and have also come to UP,” he said. The cycle rally will cover a distance of 2,384km from Tezpur in Assam to Delhi’s Rajghat, where it will reach on Gandhi Jayanti. The cyclists have crossed West Bengal and Bihar. On its UP route are Basti, Ayodhya, Barabanki, Unnao, Mati, Akbarpur, Auriya, Etawah, Shikohabad, Tundla, Kosi Kalan, Faridabad and Ghitorni.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cm-flags-off-cycle-rally-lauds-ssb-for-protecting-borders/articleshow/86411322.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Covid man gets new lungs in night-long operation||KOLKATA: Lung transplant made its debut in eastern India after doctors in Kolkata carried out a double lung transplant procedure on a man (46) in an operation that started late on Monday and continued till Tuesday dawn. The recipient was an executive at an IT major, who contracted the novel coronavirus in June and was subsequently, shifted to Medica Superspecialty from another hospital with severe Covid pneumonia. As his condition did not improve even after 90 days on ECMO, the hospital, in consultation with his family, registered his name for lung transplant with National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organization (NOTTO) and Regional Organ and Tissue Transplant Organization (ROTTO). NOTTO on Monday shared the details with ROTTO when Manish Shah, a 52-year-old patient at United Green Hospital, Surat, was declared brain dead. Medica, which was waiting for a matching lung, applied for the organ when ROTTO offered it. A seven-member team from Medica flew to Surat on Monday morning, retrieved the organ and flew back at night. The transplant started around 10.30pm and it took almost seven hours to complete. The patient was finally wheeled out of the OT around 10.30am on Tuesday. Medica vice-chairman and cardiac surgeon Kunal Sarkar, who also heads Medica Institute of Cardiac Sciences, said, “Lung transplant on a Covid patient is high-risk and challenging. Post-Covid lung transplant is one of the most stringent surgical challenges. Our team was equal to the task. We have covered some distance, but still have some way to go.” The procedure was carried out by an extensive team from cardiac surgery and cardiac critical care that included doctors Kunal Sarkar, Saptarshi Roy, Arpan Chakraborty, Dipanjan Chatterjee, Mrinal Bandhu Das, Tripti Talapatra, Ashutosh Samal, Soumyajit Ghosh, Shravan Kumar, Writuparna Das, Saibal Si and Hirak Suvra Majumder, and were assisted by Deblal Pandit, Saibal Tripathy and Soumalya Mitra. “Having the experience of running the largest ECMO programme of India, and all of Asia, we are familiar with the difficulties of severe Covid. For those who do not respond to ECMO, lung transplant is an option. We hope our recipient makes a satisfactory recovery,” said ECMO specialist Arpan Chakrabarty and cardiac critical care specialist Dipanjan Chatterjee. “Our sincere thanks to the state for supporting the transplant programme. We are also thankful to Donate Life, police and CISF personnel in Surat as well as Kolkata,” said Medica chairman Alok Roy. Surat NGO Donate Life counselled the family of the deceased to donate his organs. It helped ferry the organ till Surat airport. “We are happy to have played a small role in facilitating eastern India’s first lung transplant,” said Nilesh Mandlewala of Donate Life.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/covid-man-gets-new-lungs-in-night-long-op/articleshow/86409146.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The board started offline admissions as per the directions of the high court, but still set a few rules to control corporate junior colleges from creating unhealthy competition among students. The BIEAP in its admission notification directed the colleges to sell applications from Monday and complete the admission process by September 27. Classes start from September 28. Board stated that every college should follow rule of reservation and provide seats to SC, ST, BC communities and girls on top priority. Many colleges, mainly corporate colleges, give admissions for MPC and BiPC courses and ignore arts courses. But the board directed that every college should have MEC, CEC and HEC courses to continue their recognition. To control overcrowding in classrooms, the board has set a restriction of accommodating only 80 students per section and a maximum of nine sections per course. The board said action would be taken against those colleges which ignore the board’s guidelines. Meanwhile, many corporate colleges have completed the admission process and started online classes for the MPC and BipC courses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/bieap-set-to-effect-admission-norms/articleshow/86406868.cms||Venu Lanka

Rawat said history had been made in Punjab when a Dalit person was appointed the chief minister. “I pray to God and Ganga to get a chance in this lifetime to see a Dalit person appointed the chief minister in Uttarakhand as well. We, as a party, will work in that direction,” he said. Charanjit Singh Channi took oath as the chief minister of Punjab on Monday, becoming the state’s first Dalit CM. As the Congress’s in-charge of Punjab, Rawat played a key role in settling political drama that ensued in the state following Amarinder Singh’s resignation. In the Himalayan state of Uttarakhand, Hindus form 83% of the population, comprising mostly Thakurs and Brahmins. Understandably, the state has till now had either a Brahmin or a Thakur chief minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/wish-to-see-a-dalit-cm-in-uttarakhand-too-after-pb-harish-rawat/articleshow/86406857.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Pune||PMC repairs pipeline of Bhama Askhed project||Pune: The civic administration fixed pipeline leakages at two locations and repaired the pumps at the Bhama Askhed water project during Tuesday’s day-long closure. The eastern parts of the city, such as Lohegaon, Dhanori, Vadgaonsheri and Kalyaninagar, are being supplied water from the Bhama Askhed project since the past few months. A closure was announced on Tuesday for repair and maintenance work. An official from the PMC’s water supply department said that since the Bhama Askhed project was commissioned early this year, the functioning of the pipeline network, water turbidity and other infrastructure is being closely monitored. “During the previous closure, it was found that some works pertaining to pumping were necessary. Some leakages were also identified in the pipeline which carries water to the city. The closure was planned on Tuesday after the Ganesh festival. All the works were minor,” said the official. PMC sources said water supply to some areas in the city’s eastern parts is expected to improve by next month as the construction of one more overhead tank is in its last phase. Local MLA Sunil Tingre said the civic administration has been asked complete work on overhead tanks and distribution lines so that water from the Bhama Askhed project can reach maximum targeted areas. “A meeting will be held soon to review the progress made so far,” said Tingre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-repairs-pipeline-of-bhama-askhed-project/articleshow/86409115.cms||---
---||Pune||Three Pune mountaineers scale Mount Manda-1 in Uttarakhand||PUNE: Three mountaineers from the city have scaled Mt Manda-1, a 6,510-metre-tall mountain, which is known to be one of the most technically challenging climbs. Teams from Giripremi, a mountaineering group in the city, had tried climbing the mountain in 1989 and 1991, but couldn’t scale it. After a long wait of 32 years, Giripremi’s younger generation of mountaineers — Sumeet Mandale, Vivek Shivade and Pawan Hadole — managed to scale the mountain on September 18. Mt Manda-1 is one of the Manda group’s three peaks located in the Kedar Ganga Valley in Uttarakhand. It is one of the most challenging peaks in the Indian Himalayas and has witnessed fewer climbing expeditions. Umesh Zirpe, the mentor of the team, who was at the base camp monitoring the expedition, said, “Our younger generation of mountaineers managed to scale the mountain after battling the challenges such as rockfalls, hard ice and snow coupled with crevasses and a steep climb, among others.” Mingam Sherpa and Nim Dorje Sherpa accompanied the mountaineer’s team from Giripremi. The team reached the summit via the north ridge route, which is considered as a knife edge route where climbing gets difficult because of the narrow corniced ridge at the top and steep slopes running down in the valley. Zirpe added, “Mt Manda-1 is a challenging mountain. It challenges the mountaineers on different levels. Reaching the summit of Mt Manda-1 marks the historic moment in Indian mountaineering history as the first successful ascent from this difficult north ridge.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/three-pune-mountaineers-scale-mount-manda-1-in-uttarakhand/articleshow/86409157.cms||---
---||Delhi||2 fallen trees get new lease of life||New Delhi: Two trees, which had fallen following rain in Vasant Kunj, got a new life on Monday after the intervention of an NGO and locals. The residents dug deep pits near the fallen trees and moved the trees into the pits with hydra cranes. A metal pole was erected to support the trees and soil was spread around them. According to the residents, two Pilkhan trees on the same road fell around a week ago. Verhaen Khanna, founder of New Delhi Nature Society that saved the trees, said, “As the trees were blocking the road after they fell, the authorities had cut the parts blocking the road but we rescued the remaining parts of the trees. The trees fell due to concretisation, hot tar poured on top of roots and rain. With the help of residents of the area and from our resources, we arranged for soil, a hydra crane and labourers for the work.” He added it took several hours to remove the concrete and tar from around the trees. For saving the tree, the first step was digging deep pits near the fallen trees. In the second step, a hydra crane raised the trees and shifted them to pits. A metal rod was cut into two pieces and both were erected around the trees to give them support. Lastly, the soil was put around the trees to provide balance and to make them sturdy. “Some of the trees were still intact inside the ground, and so, these trees can now live a longer life,” said Khanna. Bindu Kapurea, a resident of the area, said the trees were saved due to community efforts as the residents helped the NGO in arranging labourers and soil for the work. Though these two trees were pulled upright, the NGO claimed more concretised trees on the road were at risk. Khanna said, “Nearly 20 trees on the same road are concretised in violation of National Green Tribunal orders. An NGT order had stated that no concretisation can be around a 1-metre radius of a tree in order to allow it to have room to grow while also receiving sufficient water to flourish. However, putting cement and tar around the trees causes them to fall, and somebody can get hurt.” An official of Delhi Development Authority said such trees on the road will be deconcretised. A forest official of west division said, “Instructions have been given to the area in charge to identify concretised trees in their jurisdiction. When they submit a report, appropriate action will be taken.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/2-fallen-trees-get-new-lease-of-life/articleshow/86411313.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

Out of the record maintained for 10 rivers flowing through districts under Nagpur division by state’s water resources department (WRD), only two — Bagh and Bawanthadi — in Gondia are flowing above the danger mark. Two out of seven gates of the Nand dam and three of the Vadgaon project in Nagpur district have been opened 0.15 and 0.10 meter, says a note from the WRD. So far none of the gates of Totladoh dam on Pench river have been opened. It is a large irrigation project of the region catering to drinking water needs of the city. The water level in Totladoh is at 83.39% and Chaurai dam, also on the Pench river on Madhya Pradesh side, has 93.30% water. Once Chaurai dam gets full the run off will be released to Totladoh in Maharashtra after which its gates may have to be opened, said sources. The IMD warning is from September 21 to 24. Elsewhere in Nagpur division, gates of Bor, Lower Wardha in Wardha and Gosikhurd dams at Bhandara have been opened. At the Bor dam, 13 have been opened till 4.5 meters. Even Lower Wardha’s 13 gates are opened at a height of 0.3 meters. The Gosikhurd dam has 21 gates opened at 0.50 meters. At the same time, 24 gates of the Mendigatta barrage in Telangana are opened, says the note In Amravati division, three gates of the Upper Wardha dam, a large project in Amravati district, have been opened apart from Bembla and Wan in Yavatmal and Akola districts respectively. The Khadakpurna project in Buldhana, which is a drought prone area, also has its five gates open. However, there is no flood like situation anywhere in the division, said divisional commissioner Piyush Singh. It has been learnt through regional metrological centre that Wani taluka in Yavatmal received 85mm rainfall which is taken as excessive downpour. According to RMC sources there was light to moderate rainfall in Amravati, Washim and Buldhana. Vijay Jawandhia, a farm activist from Wardha, said the rains have already taken a toll on the soyabean crop and cotton is also at stake. Officials of the agriculture department too expressed concern that continuing rains may hamper soyabean crop.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/many-dam-gates-opened-after-rains-across-region-soya-cotton-at-stake/articleshow/86409173.cms||Shishir Arya

Navtej Nalwa of Nalwa Labs, a lab named in the FIR filed in the case, also approached the court on Tuesday seeking anticipatory bail. The HC will now hear the case on Wednesday. Mallika and Sharat Pant, the couple who own Max Path Labs and had earlier been granted protection from arrest by the high court, have been missing since the issue of NBWs against them. Weeks later, on September 9, the court declared the duo “proclaimed offenders”, meaning they may be arrested by any police officer without any order from a magistrate and without a warrant. On Tuesday, the lawyer representing the duo challenged addition of section 467 (forgery) of the IPC (forging documents) to the FIR, “since none of the charges earlier carried a punishment of more than seven years and therefore the court wouldn’t have agreed to their arrest.” Nalwa meanwhile sought protection from arrest on the grounds of having coorperated in the investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/kumbh-accused-ask-for-relaxations-in-hc/articleshow/86406889.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Kolkata||Alzheimer’s progress can be slowed down with therapy if detected early, say experts||Kolkata: If detected early, the progression of Alzheimer’s disease can be slowed down by medications and therapies though there is no treatment for the condition. But factors, such as lack of awareness among people as well as healthcare professionals and absence of diagnostic tools, had been constraints in catching the disease young, said doctors and activists working on this cognitive health condition. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday, which was observed as World Alzheimer’s Day, appealed on Twitter to all government and private health utilities and NGOs to work together and raise awareness about the disease. Howrah bridge was also lit up in blue at night as part of the awareness programme by Alzheimer’s And Related Disorders Society of India (ARDSI) Kolkata. “Diagnosis of dementia is a challenge as people are not aware of the symptoms. During a study, we tried to cover 1 lakh households in Kolkata. The families would say there was no one suffering from it. But when we assessed, we found some of the elderly members with the symptoms,” said Bangur Institute of Neurosciences neurology professor Atanu Biswas. Doctors advise seeking professional help if a family member develops forgetfulness even though it could be something other than dementia. Alzheimer’s is a progressive disorder that causes brain cells to degenerate. It is the most common cause of dementia, resulting in decline in the affected person’s social skills, thinking and behaviour. It ultimately halts the person’s ability to function independently. Healthcare experts said like many other ailments, there was a rise in the number of people suffering from dementia, age and sedentary lifestyle being major risk factors. “Some biomarkers at research level and modern imaging techniques can now pick up changes in the brain function that might help in early diagnosis. Early diagnosis can help slowing down the disease progress through preventive therapies,” said Biswas. “Someone or the other is developing this condition every three seconds across the globe. We are currently working with 7,500 people suffering from dementia in Kolkata with care support, 70% of whom were referred to us by doctors,” said ARDSI Kolkata secretary Nilanjana Maulik. One of the 24 ARDSI chapters across India, the Kolkata unit runs a daycare centre and a clinic and provides home companions for the affected. They also train families in how to care for the ailing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/alzheimers-progress-can-be-slowed-down-with-therapy-if-detected-early-say-experts/articleshow/86409206.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Kozhikode||Love jihad: Speak up, Muneer tells CM||Kozhikode: Lashing out at CPM and the government over the narcotic jihad row, senior IUML leader MK Muneer said that CM Pinarayi Vijayan has the responsibility to speak up if ‘love jihad’ is going on in state especially since CPM has, in a party note, said that there are extremists activities going on in some professional colleges. Addressing the media on Tuesday, he claimed the statements made by CPM and its leaders on the issue were dangerous and amounted to casting aspersions on a community. “They said that one community was carrying out extremist activities after sneaking into professional college campuses. Then, it is the responsibility of the CM, who is also handling the home portfolio, to tell the public in which college was it taking place and who was carrying out such extremist activities and we will also help in weeding out such activities if at all it is happening,” he said, adding that that no other political party was ‘as communal as CPM’. Muneer said that making statements without clarity and hiding some information would only serve to create discord between communities. “We should examine if it will be helpful for the state if those who are supposed to take all communities together are trying to create a wedge between communities for political gains,” he said. Muneer said that as the statements which have come out from CPM leaders A Vijayaraghavan and VN Vasavan were same in tone, the chief minister should tell where extremism, ‘love jihad or narcotic jihad’ are taking place. Meanwhile, CPI state secretary Kanam Rajendran pooh-poohed the ongoing reconciliation attempts made by the Congress, following the ‘narcotic jihad’ statement made by Pala bishop Mar Joseph Kallarangatt, by saying that the incident has become a perfect example of how an issue can be worsened through talks. Kanam said that love and marriages have been going on ever since the advent of humans and it was wrong to give it religious colours. “All religious leaders should strive to ensure religious amity. Kerala did not have such problems. That peaceful atmosphere got disrupted following his (Pala bishop’s) statement. So let him examine if that was correct. After that the government will look into it,” he said. KPCC president K Sudhakaran said the stand taken by Kanam against holding reconciliation talks was shameful. “Any other government would have convened an all-party meet to bring about reconciliation. There is no point in taking steps after the issue gets out of hand,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/love-jihad-speak-up-muneer-tells-cm/articleshow/86409226.cms||---

The cuts introduced in the municipal budget should be withdrawn and 100% budget provision should be utilised for local work, the corporators said at the GB meeting on Tuesday, adding that the revenue committee formed for monitoring the expenditure on civic work should be scrapped. The elected members from the BJP, NCP, Congress, Shiv Sena and the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena expressed concern over the pending civic projects due to fund crunch. “The income has gone up during the last few months. But the cuts are still in place. The revenue committee is causing procedural delays. This is hampering the development work,” echoed the members. They said that the fund shortage was witnessed due to Covid-19 last year. Many projects have been left incomplete. “The final decision on the corporators’ demands will be taken on Thursday.

---||Lucknow||BJP hastens booth mobilisation, to hold ‘panna pramukh’ training||Lucknow: BJP is planning to hold special training sessions for ‘panna pramukhs’ — key functionaries of a well-oiled organisational machinery — after completing appointments by month-end, in what marks the party’s move to step up mobilization of grassroots workers ahead of assembly elections. Sources said, the party is expected to hold the training session spanning over three days in the second week of October. The move attains political significance since BJP, in the past, would conduct the exercise closer to polling day. “This time, the task is being planned relatively earlier to escalate the process of strengthening the party at booth-level,” a top state BJP leader told TOI. A ‘panna pramukh’ is essentially appointed from among voters in the respective list. Each of 1.63lakh booths in UP has around 15 to 20 pramukhs, who help BJP in marshalling at least 60 voters in their respective areas. “They will coordinate with voters and motivate them to exercise their franchise in large numbers,” the BJP leader said. Experts said, BJP’s electoral performance rests on a higher voter turnout – a key reason behind party hastening activities at the booth level, while gearing up to take on a belligerent opposition. The move is also seen as party’s attempt to get a grassroots feedback to dispel possible anti-incumbency, while charting out a corrective course vis-a-vis implementation of government welfare schemes. “Earlier, feedback was gathered by booth-level committees. We need to raise micro-level planning with help of panna pramukhs,” the BJP leader said, asserting that the move will help in dissipating the “false narrative” wheeled out by the opposition. The development comes close on heels of the ‘Booth Vijay Abhiyan’ flagged off by party national president JP Nadda on September 11. Sources said that BJP will seek to harp on the popularity of PM Narendra Modi and CM Yogi Adityanath, while aggressively disseminating measures taken by the ruling party in preserving the cultural heritage and spiritual prosperity of UP. The legacy of former PM and party stalwart Atal Bihari Vajpayee is also proposed to be invoked by BJP, while executing the grassroots campaign. At the same time, sources said, party functionaries have been directed to expose the “casteist” and “community appeasement” driven politics of the opposition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-hastens-booth-mobilisation-to-hold-panna-pramukh-training/articleshow/86411381.cms||Pankaj Shah

---||Visakhapatnam||Southwest monsoon ends with 21% excess rainfall in Andhra Pradesh||VISAKHAPATNAM: Most of the districts in state have received excess rainfall so far, thanks to low pressures and depression over Bay of Bengal in September. The southwest monsoon (June 1 - September 20) in AP ended with 21 per cent excess rainfall. Only three districts, Nellore, Prakasam and Kurnool, received rainfall deficient by 8 per cent, 5 per cent and 2 per cent respectively in this period. Yanam of Puducherry (Union Territory) recorded 3 per cent deficiency. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) officials said the southwest monsoon covered the entire Andhra Pradesh on June 10, five days after it arrived over the Rayalaseema region of the state. From June 1 to September 20, state recorded 553.7 mm rainfall as against the normal 458.6 mm, which translates to an excess of 21 per cent rainfall. Among all the 13 districts in the state, Chittoor received 50 per cent excess rainfall (582.7 mm against normal 387.7mm), followed by Kadapa (34 per cent excess with 475.1 mm against normal 419.9mm), Guntur (33 per cent excess with 656.6 mm against 495.1 mm) and Anantapur (27 per cent excess with 369.9 mm against the normal rainfall of 291.9 mm). The IMD officials said four to five districts in the state didn’t receive good rainfall till mid-August as the southwest monsoon subdued in parts of the state. The formation of the low-pressure areas over the Bay of Bengal activated the monsoon. Speaking to TOI, director of IMD - Amaravati, Stella S, said the upper air cyclonic circulations over west central and north west Bay and low pressures and depression over the Bay of Bengal triggered good rainfall in many parts of the state in August and September. Rayalaseema region comprising Anantapur, Chittoor, YSR Kadapa, and Kurnool districts recorded 452.1 mm of rainfall as against the normal 361.1 mm. The coastal Andhra Pradesh and Yanam region comprising nine districts and part of Pudducherry (UT) received 627.4 mm rainfall as against the normal 527.2 mm, she added. IMD predicts southwest monsoon will withdraw by October 15.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/sw-monsoon-ends-with-21-excess-rainfall/articleshow/86406897.cms||Nalla.Babu
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Central Railway’s new recruits ‘Surya’ & ‘Simbha’ to sniff out drug menace||MUMBAI: In a first, the Central Railway’s Railway Protection Force (RPF) has decided to train two dogs from its squad to trace illegal drugs that are smuggled into Mumbai through long distance trains from various parts of the country. The Mumbai division recently procured three-month-old puppies — Ranjar, Surya, Snuffy, Bagheera, Simbha, Bond, Raja, Ruddy and Bolt. Of these, Bagheera (Dobermann) is a tracker while the other eight (Labrador) are sniffer dogs. The RPF has zeroed in on Surya and Simbha to be trained for tracing illegal drugs. “Those who smuggle banned substances rarely keep their stock near their berth to avoid arrest. Snifferdogs capable of sniffing such banned drugs will be able to trace the accused too,” said an RPF official. RPF has been vested with powers to arrest, investigate and prosecute under the Railway Property (Unlawful Possession) Act and the Railways Act. The RPF has been empowered by the Union government since 2019, under the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985. CR senior divisional security commissioner for Mumbai Jitendra Srivastava said, “Till now, the dog squad was trained to sniff explosives to thwart any terror attack. Now, however, we will send two Labrador dogs for training to equip them with the ability to sniff contraband drugs too.” “These dogs will be sent for 8 months of training to Delhi and Pune, and will then be deployed at CSMT and LTT stations,” he added. Srivastava said there has been an uptick in smuggling of illegal drugs, particularly from the eastern part of the country. RPF has attributed this trend to lack of employment opportunity due to COVID-induced lockdown. Since January 2021, there have been seven instances of RPF confiscating ganja, of which four consignments were traced in Konark Express which originates in Bhubaneshwar. A total of 40kg of ganja valuing Rs 5 lakh was seized since April in this train but arrest was made only in one case. “There are ganja growing areas, particularly in naxal-infested areas of Orissa and Andhra Pradesh from where the stock is supplied to Mumbai by train. Bhubaneshwar Express is the preferred mode of transport,” said a source. The sniffer dogs will be trained to sniff out different narcotic and psychotropic substances, including marijuana, methamphetamines, cocaine, heroin, MDMA and PCP, among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-crs-new-recruits-surya-simbha-to-sniff-out-drug-menace/articleshow/86411409.cms||Manthank Mehta
---||Nagpur||Covid admissions restart in private hospitals after two months||Nagpur: A couple of big private hospitals have restarted their Covid wards following constant queries for admission from positive persons in the last couple of days. Two unvaccinated persons with severe Covid were admitted at one private hospital last week. Private hospitals had shut down their Covid facilities completely after June this year to focus on regular patient care. The flow of Covid patients too had significantly declined at that time. As per the Nagpur civil surgeon’s data, the district had 336 patients under treatment by June end. Of these, 145 were admitted to government and private DCHs as well as CCCs. The admissions dropped to 66 by July end. In August, the admissions further declined to below 50 and only three private hospitals out of the over 150 had a patient each. On September 21, 76 patients were under treatment. Of them, one or more patients were admitted to five private hospitals. Last month, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) enforced compulsory institutional isolation of asymptomatic Covid patients. Those developing symptoms or having comorbidities are transferred to AIIMS Nagpur where now 13 patients are admitted. Many more have been discharged in the last two weeks. The admissions at MLA hostel CCC has surged to 24. Though the NMC has exempted pregnant and bedridden persons from institutional isolation, teenagers are asked to shift to the MLA Covid care centre (CCC). A woman had to accompany her son to the CCC. However, a 15-year-old’s parents moved him to a private hospital. MLA CCC staff told TOI that two more teenagers shifted to paid quarantine centre following the consent of their zonal medical officer. Some hospitals, who previously ran Covid wards, said they are not sure of admitting asymptomatic persons under the existing norms. As per guidelines, dedicated Covid hospitals can admit only mild to severe patients. Dr Harshvardhan Bora, internal medicine expert at Kingsway Hospital, said they had four patients recently. “Two unvaccinated patients had to be put on non-invasive ventilator as their oxygen level dropped. One of them took discharge against medical advice. The vaccinated ones didn’t have much problem,” he said. Dr Mohan Nerker, one of the directors of Seven Star Hospital, said many patients of respiratory infection are reporting negative in RT-PCR test. “There were a couple of queries for Covid admissions but we are yet to restart. Recently, there was another query from a positive couple having US travel history. They were vaccinated so had less severe Covid and they recovered at home. Another vaccinated city couple is being treated at home,” he said. Dr Nerker said though spike in cases has been reported in Mumbai, Delhi, Pune and Kerala but the severity is not like the second wave. “As per our knowledge, vaccinated patients are not staying for longer periods in hospitals,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-admissions-restart-in-private-hospitals-after-two-months/articleshow/86409237.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

---||Delhi||September rain record since 1944 may fall in Delhi as Met issues orange alert for today||NEW DELHI: The capital received a spell of light rain on Tuesday, adding another 3.6mm to Safdarjung’s September’s rainfall total and taking the monthly figure to 408.3mm. The IMD meanwhile issued an ‘orange’ alert for Wednesday, forecasting moderate showers in parts of Delhi, which could also lead to waterlogging in places. Wednesday’s shower is expected to see Delhi cross the all-time September rainfall record of 417.3mm, which was recorded all the way back in September of 1944. The IMD, in its seven-day forecast on Tuesday, said rain was expected to continue across Delhi till Monday, with moderate spells expected on both Wednesday and Thursday. “The intensity will drop on Friday, with only a drizzle expected in some places, but light rain will return for Saturday and Sunday,” said a Met official, stating Delhi was on track to beat the record for September rainfall. For this monsoon overall, Safdarjung has received 1,164.7mm of rainfall between June 1 and September 21, making it the third-highest monsoon ever recorded in the city and the highest since 1964 when Delhi received 1,190.9mm — another record that may break in the coming days. Between 8:30 am and 8:30 pm on Tuesday, Safdarjung recorded 3.6mm of rainfall, while Lodhi Road, Ridge and Pitampura stations received 1mm, 17.6mm and 7mm of rainfall, respectively. No rain was recorded at other stations, IMD data showed. The capital had a maximum temperature of 35.6 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, with the relative humidity oscillating between 55% and 89% in the last 24 hours. The IMD forecasts the maximum temperature to drop to around 32 degrees on Wednesday, with moderate showers expected in most places. The IMD classifies rainfall as ‘moderate’ when it is between 15.6 and 64.4mm. The air quality remained in the ‘satisfactory’ range on Tuesday, with an overall air quality index (AQI) reading of 83, according to the Central Pollution Control Board. SAFAR, a government air forecasting body says despite the rain, air quality is expected to remain in the ‘satisfactory’ range in the coming days. “Delhi’s AQI is in the satisfactory category as local pollution with dust uplifting dominates under low ventilation. With the presence of light rain, AQI is going to be in the satisfactory category,” said SAFAR on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sept-rain-record-since-1944-may-fall-as-met-issues-orange-alert-for-today/articleshow/86411392.cms||---

The bench of Justice Revati Mohite-Dere released the operative part of the order stating that the applicant (Purandare) be released on bail on executing a personal release bond of Rs2 lakh and one or more sureties in the like amount. Further, she should attend the (Shivajinagar) police station concerned once in three months on the first Saturday of a month between 11am and 1pm till further orders and should not tamper with proof or try to influence or contact the complainant, witnesses or any person concerned with the case, the court said. It said the applicant should not leave India without the trial court’s permission and should deposit her passport with the trial court. A full text of the order is to be released in due course. This was Purandare’s second attempt at securing bail. Her lawyer, Tanveer Khan, told TOI, “The bench allowed our bail plea primarily on grounds of parity with a similar relief granted earlier (on August 17) in the same case to co-accused Hemanti Kulkarni and on the merits of the plea.” Hemanti is DSK’s wife and Purandare’s sister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bail-for-dsks-sister-in-law-in-economic-fraud-case/articleshow/86409262.cms||Vishwas Kothari

The chief minister said, “Giving communal tint to social evils and painting terrorist organisations in good light will weaken the social fabric.” While commenting on giving good light to terrorist movements, he was referring to the support pledged by a section of people towards Taliban fundamentalists. Speaking after inaugurating the centenary celebrations of “Swanthatryam Thanne Amritham” at the Ayyankali Hall here on Tuesday, the CM said the society now needs a generation which can think secular and progressively. “However, there is a tendency to give communal colour to several social evils. Such attempts should be nipped in the bud,” he said. “It is not right to give the impression that people acting against the interests of society belongs to any particular community or religion. Such attempts will not do any good and it would create a divide in the society in resisting such evils. It is also important to note that giving a good light to the terrorist movements would also disintegrate society’s unity,” the CM said. Later, speaking after inaugurating a party local committe office in Palakkad online, Vijayan again hit out at the Pala bishop. He said it was the most unfortunate statement that has come from a person holding such a position. There has been an attempt to support and oppose this with ulterior motives. Whoever is trying to create a communal divide will be seriously dealt with, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/do-not-give-communal-tint-to-social-evils/articleshow/86409351.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Aunt of minor rape survivor supports accused, but he gets 15-year RI sentence||MUMBAI: Even as the aunt of an 11-year-old sexual assault survivor submitted an affidavit in court in support of the perpetrator, a 32-year-old school sweeper, claiming after he was held guilty that it was a case of mistaken identity, a special Pocso court sentenced him to 15 years’ rigorous imprisonment for repeatedly raping the girl and threatening to kill her in 2015. After the child’s mother and sister died and her father abandoned her, she was raised by an aunt. The aunt, the complainant, earlier testified against the accused alongside the survivor. He was found guilty on August 18 but was sentenced on Thursday as he moved pleas, including one for a “narco-analysis test to bring out the truth”. The court rejected his plea. Refusing to accept the aunt’s belated plea in his support, the court said she had stopped keeping track of the case after deposing as a prosecution witness in 2019, so filing the plea after he was held guilty cannot be mere coincidence. The court said after tragedies in her family, the child was left at the aunt’s mercy. “When the victim is living at the mercy of her aunt, who happens to be the complainant, but files an application for discharge of the accused, it cannot be accepted as the victim’s voluntary statement. The application is filed after he was held guilty and judgment was suspended for hearing on the point of sentence,” the court said. It said claims in the affidavit were not a “compromise” . “Neither complainant nor victim was produced in court for verification of contents of the affidavit…” it said. He was out on bail since 2015 and was taken into custody after he was held guilty and was fined Rs40,000. The aunt had complained to police in March 2015, after the child revealed that he was raping her during school recess. The aunt often saw abrasions on the child’s body and asked her about it. Initially, the child gave excuses, but on March 25, 2015, when she returned from school limping, she confided about being sexually assaulted many times. She said she kept mum as he threatened to kill her. The accused claimed he was falsely implicated by a man who wanted to close the school and develop a commercial establishment there. The court said there was no evidence to prove the claims.

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: ED to grill Atiq Ahmad in Sabarmati jail, wife summoned||LUCKNOW: Enforcement Directorate (ED) personnel are likely to question don-turned-politician, Atiq Ahmad, at Sabarmati prison, where he’s currently lodged, if his wife, Shaista Parveen, ignores a third summon for recording her statement on benami properties. On April 10, ED registered a case under Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against jailed gangster, Atiq Ahmad, who along with his son, Umar, has 195 criminal cases lodged against them. ED sources confirmed it has tracked down 16 real estate firms with dubious transactions linked to Atiq, his son and wife and sought personal appearance of his wife for questioning. “After she ignored two summons, we have issued a third,” said an official. ED officials said, after registration of the case, auditors of the don’s companies were summoned, but they too refused to cooperate. Later, summons was issued to Umar Ahmad, who too spurned the summons, said the officer. Umar was then charged under Section 174 IPC for disobedience of a public servant’s order, but this too was ignored.

---||Bhopal||DEN-2 virus threat looms, 9 more dengue cases found in Bhopal||BHOPAL: Nine more cases of dengue were diagnosed in the state capital on Tuesday. The total number of cases this season is about 275. The new cases, come at a time when the Union ministry of health and family welfare indicated prevalence of serotype II in Madhya Pradesh. However, district malaria officer (DMO) told TOI that serotype I is prevalent in Bhopal. Knowledge of the serotype is linked to understanding secondary infections. These are associated with elevated risks of severe disease outcomes, according to experts. Dengue infection is caused chiefly by four viruses known as serotypes – DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3 and DEN-4. According to experts, DEN-2 virus is the most threatening of the four viruses. A four-year cyclical spurt in dengue cases is anticipated by some epidemiologists. “For a common person, the most important thing, once infected with dengue is to avoid the second bite. A second bite can lead to hospitalisation and require more accelerated treatment protocols. The ideal way is to use a mosquito net and avoid further risk,” said a health department doctor, who is credited with controlling the vector-borne outbreak. Bhopal, like other districts of the state, had seen a spike in dengue cases in 2018 and 2019. The lockdown and pandemic kept dengue under control in 2020. According to reports, in light of the forthcoming festival season, in Delhi a high-level review meeting on the dengue situation took note of the high-test positivity and ordered the states to prevent mass gatherings. It includes Madhya Pradesh along with Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Kerala, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Telangana are among the states reporting dengue cases of serotype II. When contacted, NVDSP did not respond on deployment of rapid response teams for prompt investigation, fever surveys, vector control measures and contact tracing apart from ensuring adequate stocks of blood platelets and other components in blood banks. First, primary and secondary infections are distinguishable based on their antibody responses. The ability of all DENV serotypes to utilise pre-existing heterotypic Flavivirus antibody to enhance infection unique feature of dengue. This distinguishes it from all other flaviviruses, according to experts||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/den-2-virus-threat-looms-9-more-dengue-cases-found-in-bhopal/articleshow/86407000.cms||Jamal Ayub
---||Delhi||Click to submit PhD thesis as Delhi University makes process online||NEW DELHI: To smoothen the PhD thesis submission and the evaluation process that follows, Delhi University aims to go fully online. The online portal, which is likely to be launched within the next two months, will contain details of each student enrolled for doctorate courses, including the six-month progress reports of each scholar. DU has also amended an existing ordinance by which faculty members or supervisors will be required to submit the list of viva-voce examiners before or on the day of the thesis submission. According to senior university officials, this change will come into effect from next week. Under current norms, the examiners’ list for the viva process can be submitted within a month of the thesis submission. In several instances, this has led to delays and increased pendency of the results, DU officials said. D S Rawat, DU’s dean of examination, told TOI, “While the viva examiners’ list is expected to be submitted within a month of students submitting their thesis, what often happens is that the lists are not sent to the examination branch. The process of getting the examiners’ list cleared is also a lengthy one. If the names are not sent in time, then it becomes difficult to follow up the long-pending cases and students are left in a lurch about when their vivas will be conducted.” Rawat added, “The new PhD thesis submission form will have space for the examiners’ list and it means that the examination branch will be able to forward the thesis as soon as it is submitted because the examiners’ list will have to be submitted at the same time. Once the online portal is launched, the scholars will also be able to track the progressive stages of their course work.” Officials also pointed out that the entire exercise would be made paperless, which would greatly reduce the cost incurred by students for printing copies of their thesis at the time of submission. Providing an estimate of the volume of printing that is involved, Garvit Rai of Daljeet Photocopy Service in North Campus revealed for TOI, “For each student, we usually print eight or nine copies of their thesis. Each copy has a minimum of 300 pages and sometimes even 500 pages.” Once the online portal is implemented, progress reports and recommendations given by the advisory committees to students will also be available on the platform. “Everything will be automated and human intervention will come down,” claimed Rawat. “Once the final examiners’ list is approved by the vice-chancellor, the panel will receive emails, to which they have to respond within nine days, failing which new mails will be sent to the standby examiners.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/click-to-submit-phd-thesis-as-du-makes-process-online/articleshow/86411487.cms||---

A circular issued by the board on Tuesday said, “Keeping in view the pandemic’s impact on students, CBSE — as a special measure for the academic session 2021-22 — has decided that neither the examination fees nor the registration fees will be charged by the board from students who have lost both parents or surviving parent or legal guardian/adoptive parents due to Covid-19.” The schools have been told that while submitting the LOC, they should provide the details of these students after verifying the genuineness. The last date for paying registration fees without late charges is September 30. Along with the late fees the deadline is October 9. Meanwhile, students in Delhi — mostly studying in Delhi government schools — have started a postcard campaign, asking the government to pay the fees. On Tuesday, around 200 postcards written by the students from different parts of Delhi were submitted at the lieutenant governor’s office. In 2019, Delhi government had paid the fees of both class X and XII students.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Accused tried to bribe nine-year-old victim’s parents not to report matter, cops claim in chargesheet||NEW DELHI: The men accused in the case of alleged gang-rape and murder of a nine-year-old Dalit girl, whose body was forcefully cremated in Delhi Cantonment, took advantage of the poverty, illiteracy and the affiliation of the victim’s parents to the oppressed section of society, and tried to bribe them to not report the matter, Delhi Police has claimed in its chargesheet. Police claimed that the statements of the mother, recorded under Section 164 CrPC, and several other witnesses mentioned that an alleged middleman, Naresh, tried to offer the victim’s parents Rs 20,000 to silence them, but they refused. Radhey Shyam, the 55-year-old crematorium priest, threw his mobile phone, footwear of the girl and the bedding on which he had allegedly raped the minor into the pyre to destroy evidence. Traces of the mobile phone were found in the ash. The parents were threatened by the accused — Shyam, Kuldeep Singh, Salim and Laxmi Narayan — and confined to the crematorium. “The four accused threatened the parents and by taking advantage of their poverty, illiteracy and their affiliation to the oppressed section of society, they managed to oppress their thought process and forcefully cremated the deceased,” the chargesheet stated. The chargesheet also quoted the mother’s statement recorded before a magistrate that Shyam allegedly used to take massages from her daughter. The accused allegedly threw water on the girl’s clothes to make people believe that she died because of electrocution while drinking from the cooler. Police had recently told a court that the girl was allegedly suffocated to death during sexual assault by Shyam. It was further alleged that the victim’s mother was called by Shyam to the crematorium, where her daughter was lying on a bench. The girl’s hands had bruises and wounds on the elbows of both hands. The mother alleged that when she reached there, the accused were cooking non-veg and were drinking liquor in the hall. Police said bottles with liquor labels were seized from Shyam’s room. “She pleaded with them to take her to a hospital, but they did not. She also pleaded with them to call police, but Radhey Shyam and the others did not allow that. She wanted to touch and check the body of her daughter, but Shyam did not let her do that. She told them that they had raped and murdered her daughter and that’s why they were not letting her check and touch the body. Still, they did not let her come near the body,” the mother’s complaint mentioned. When the mother pleaded with Shyam to give the body of her daughter, he did not pay any heed. He told her that the body had to be cremated, else it would become a police case and doctors would take out all the organs. They allegedly threatened her and Shyam put the body of her daughter on the pyre and set it alight. Police further said there was “no electric current” in the water cooler’s body. The FSL report stated, “No biological fluid, DNA trace or sample was found on the body of the water cooler, which clearly suggests that the deceased was not electrocuted. In case of electrocution, DNA traces would be present.” Police further claimed that Shyam was addicted to porn, which was revealed from the history of his mobile phone, and he had shown sexually explicit content to the victim several times. (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/accused-tried-to-bribe-victims-parents-not-to-report-matter-cops-claim-in-chargesheet/articleshow/86409364.cms||Usha Das
---||Dehradun||Narendra Giri death: Accused disciple globe-trotting sadhu once held in Oz for sexual harassment||HARIDWAR: At 15, Anand Giri decided to “renounce” worldly pleasures and turn into a sanyasi. His search for a guru to give him ‘deeksha’ (blessings) as he embarked on his spiritual journey brought him to Haridwar where he met Narendra Giri, a mahant of Niranjani akhara, in 2000. Over the years, Anand, a scholar of Vedas and Sanskrit from Rajasthan's Bhilwara district, came to be known as Giri’s closest disciple. But in 2020, the guru-shishya duo parted ways following years of disagreements and a bitter dispute over mutt property. On Monday, Anand was arrested after Giri, the head of the influential Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad, was found hanging in UP’s Baghambari mutt — that belongs to Niranjani akhara — with a suicide note alleging blackmail by his former disciple and two others. Anand, now 35, has been booked for abetment of suicide. “Their relationship had turned bitter in the last decade, leading Giri to expel Anand from the Baghambari mutt last year. But after Anand offered a public apology and others intervened, he was reinstated,” said a seer in Haridwar. As Giri rose in stature in the past decade — from mahant to chief of the Akhara Parishad, the apex body of 13 akharas in India, in 2016 — so did his disciple. Often, he was seen riding luxury cars. Anand’s trips abroad, too, became frequent in the past decade. He would fly business class. In one such trip to Australia in 2018, Anand was arrested for allegedly sexually harassing a woman he was teaching yoga to. Last year, a photo of Anand circulated online in which he was flying business class and “drinking”. He later said it was apple juice. His lifestyle was a bone of contention between him and Giri who accused him of damaging the akhara’s reputation. Giri was also upset that Anand had not cut ties with his family, said a seer. “He was a sanyasi, but he didn’t take sanyas in the true sense,” the seer told TOI, adding that Anand was married and had children. The two were embroiled in a bitter property dispute, with Anand opposing Giri’s decision to sell land of Baghambari mutt to individuals. Things came to a head when Giri accused his disciple of financial irregularities. “The Akhara Parishad chief suspected that Anand had used mutt money to build his own ashram in Haridwar where he housed his family,” said a seer. Once Anand was expelled from the mutt, he was quoted in media reports this year claiming to have videos and other evidence of sadhus, including Giri, engaging in “immoral activities”. But things seemed to have settled down in May this year when a compromise was made between the two in Lucknow in the presence of a former MLA from the Samajwadi Party SP, another leader from the BJP and a senior police officer. According to police, the accused has claimed that he has been framed by people angry over his opposition to sale of the mutt land to private individuals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/narendra-giri-death-accused-disciple-globe-trotting-sadhu-once-held-in-oz-for-sexual-harassment/articleshow/86406987.cms||Sheo S Jaiswal
---||Goa||Goa: Five fatalities in four road accidents in 24 hours||PANAJI: A total of four fatal road accidents over a period of 24 hours have claimed five lives and left one injured. While two of these accidents involved two-wheelers, the rest involved four-wheelers. All four cases were that of self-accidents according to the traffic cell. The traffic cell as well as road safety activists have called for immediate measures to curb road accidents in the state. “People must follow traffic rules and comply with speed restrictions. Goa’s roads are not designed for speeding and there is a need to comply with speed limits,” said DySP traffic, North Goa, Salim Shaikh. Despite the potholed and dilapidated condition of several of the state’s roads, Shaikh said that these accidents took place due to reasons other than road engineering. He said that the winding Arpora road where one car met with an accident measures only 5m and the traffic cell is now proposing to the PWD to build a crash barrier there, install signage and widen the road. The other car accident that took place at the Bambolim road. There was negligible traffic at the time of the accident and the stretch is wide. However, it is suspected that the driver of the car was drunk, which has prompted the traffic cell to restart the use of alcometers, which were suspended due to the pandemic “It is high time. We cannot see life perishing on the road due to drunken driving. We will also step up on booking speeding cases now on,” he said. Road safety activist Roland Martins said that there is a need for proper barricading near all water bodies and awareness programmes for motorists, especially tourists, on what to do when trapped inside a drowning vehicle. He also stressed on the need for wearing of seatbelts by rear-seat riders to ensure that what happened to the Bambolim accident victim doesn’t reoccur. “Driving in Panaji is not the same as in Canacona and Pernem is not the same as in Valpoi. Though there are higher two-wheeler fatalities reported in Goa annually, this is a serious wake-up call for those travelling in a car who feel road safety doesn’t concern them,” he said. A road safety activist from Ponda Pramod Sawant said that this does not mean that road engineering may be overlooked. “We lack infrastructure like proper street-lighting and signage warning motorists about cattle zones, speed bumps, etc, which when added to poor road engineering makes for a dangerous mix for two-wheeler riders. Night patrolling is necessary in the coastal belt and interior village areas to keep a watch on rash and negligent drivers,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/five-fatalities-in-four-road-accidents-in-24-hours/articleshow/86409382.cms||Nida Sayed

For the first time, black granite stones are being shipped from quarries in forested Kollegal region on the Karnataka-Tamil Nadu border for building the plinth, besides sourcing sculpted stones from Mirzapur and pink marble from Bansi Paharpur in Rajasthan. Temple Trust member Anil Mishra, who attended the ceremony, said, “Lord Vishwakarma was worshipped amid Vedic chants before installation of the first stone for erecting the 'garbh griha'. Supply of stones has already begun from Kollegal and Mirzapur.” More than 2 lakh bricks collected by VHP from across India during the three-decade-old temple movement will now be used for temple construction, said top sources in the Trust. Since 1989, more than 3 lakh bricks bearing Ram’s name were mobilised with a pledge to use them for the temple, but later stashed at Ramjanmabhoomi Nirman Karyashala. These will now be shifted to the temple construction workshop. Talking to TOI, temple Trust member, Anil Mishra, said, “One lakh stones were laid during the 1989 ‘shilanyas’ by kar sevaks at Ramjanmabhoomi.” According to Mishra, “At least 2 lakh remain at the old workshop, which will be shifted to the construction site. The bricks bear testimony to the faith of crores of Indians.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/granite-from-ktaka-to-raise-temple-plinth/articleshow/86411537.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Extension for 448 Special Tiger Protection Force, 1 SGNP posts||Mumbai: The state revenue and forest department has granted a one-year extension for 448 posts created for the Special Tiger Protection Force (STPF). The STPF was set up last year for one year for the Tadoba-Andhari, Pench, Navegaon-Nagzira and Melghat tiger reserves.It is estimated that there are over 350 tigers in Vidarbha, resulting in increasing man-animal conflict in the region. This year so far, there have been 25 deaths reported on account of tiger attacks. As against this, a single temporary post of assistant forest guard sanctioned in 1995 for Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) has been approved for continuation. The post was created on the directions of the Bombay high court following a public interest litigation against increasing encroachment of forest lands and the need to remove these encroachments. Last year, officials of SGNP had informed the court that they are unable to carry out rehabilitation of the eligible slum dwellers as they neither have the expertise for it nor the requisite tenements. The park is dependent on the revenue department for the allotments. Sunil Limaye, additional principal chief conservator of forests, said the two appointments are completely different. In case of the former, it is a central government scheme and 60% of the funds are provided by the Centre. In case of SGNP, the encroachments are a mix of those eligible for free housing and those who are ineligible. “We need more than 12,000 tenements to shift those who are eligible. More than staff, we need the tenements so that the residents can be shifted and the forest restored,” he said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-extension-for-448-special-tiger-protection-force-1-sgnp-posts/articleshow/86412708.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Incompatible horoscopes no excuse to resile from marriage promise: Bombay HC||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Monday refused relief for a Badlapur resident who took the pretext of incompatible horoscopes to resile from his promise to marry the woman he was in a relationship with. “It is apparent that that applicant under the guise of astrological incompatibility of horoscopes avoided the promise. Thus I am convinced that the material on record suggests it is a case of false promise to marry which apparently vitiates the complainant’s consent,” Justice Sandeep Shinde said. He rejected the plea for discharge by the man who was booked by Borivli police in January 2013 for rape and cheating based on the woman’s complaint. Earlier, the Dindoshi court too had rejected his plea. In the first information report, the woman said that they got close in 2012 while working in a hotel. She said the man exploited her physically and mentally and when she conceived, he convinced her to abort and promised to marry her after two years. Later he avoided her. On her December 28, 2012 complaint, the police suggested counselling. In the presence of his parents, the man assured he would marry her. On January 6, 2013, she withdrew her complaint. On January 18, 2013, he told the counsellor he cannot marry her. The woman then renewed her complaint. In the high court, senior advocate Raja Thakare, for the accused, argued that it was a case of breach of promise and not false promise of marriage. He said since the horoscopes did not match and being a case of astrological incompatibility, relations could not be furthered. But Justice Shinde, in his Monday’s order, said, “There is sufficient material to suggest that since inception, the applicant had no intention of upholding his promise to marry the complainant.” He prevailed upon her to withdraw her complaint by promising to marry her, the judge added. Agreeing with prosecutor Sharmila Kaushik, Justice Shinde noted that had the man’s intentions been bona fide and true, he would not have written to the counsellor within 12 days after withdrawal of complaint and resiled from his promise to marry her. The judge also noted that the “guise” of incompatible horoscopes was taken to avoid marriage. The HC then concluded that the man’s plea deserves no consideration as facts on record disclose ingredients of rape.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/incompatible-horoscopes-no-excuse-to-resile-from-marriage-promise-in-mumbai-hc/articleshow/86411545.cms||Rosy Sequeira
---||India||Covid: Mumbai hospital eyes booster shot for health staff||MUMBAI: Powai’s LH Hiranandani Hospital is the first in the city to write to the corporation and state government demanding a booster shot for healthcare workers. TOI had reported last week how several healthcare workers and politicians were skirting Co-Win to take the third shot, fearing a depletion in their antibody levels. A third booster shot against Covid-19 has not been allowed by the Centre yet. However, some western countries have approved a booster shot for those immunocompromised and for healthcare workers. In India, the Centre has said the booster shot is not a priority and the policy would focus on universal vaccination of citizens. “It’s almost six months since health staff took a second jab. In over 80% of health workers, by now the efficacy of vaccine taken has reduced considerably and among many it has become nil as on today,” said Dr Sujit Chatterjee, CEO of LH Hiranandani. He added that while the Centre’s priority of completing administering of second doses to cover the maximum population is understandable and even logical, it needs to be seen that those on the frontlines are protected. “The booster jab can be restricted only to health workers, which is a tiny portion of the total population,” he said. Several hospital heads that TOI spoke to support the idea of a third shot but have decided to wait for a decision from the Centre. The issue of taking booster shots was also discussed in a recent meeting of the Association of Hospitals (AOH), which includes Mumbai’s major trust-run hospitals. Dr V Ravishankar, COO of Lilavati Hospital, said the AOH won’t approach the government for booster shots at the moment. “The need for a third shot is still being studied. Healthcare workers are measuring antibody levels but there is also something called cell-mediated immunity that must be considered. Most countries have recommended a third shot mainly for those with immune deficiencies,” he said, adding that hospitals are watching the emerging evidence closely. The head of a private hospital said several have taken the third shot after measuring their antibodies. Hemant Deshmukh, dean of KEM Hospital, said breakthrough infections among health workers are being reported, but they are a handful. “If our hospital laboratory is detecting an average of four or five positive cases daily, one or two would be of breakthrough infections,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/covid-mumbai-hospital-eyes-booster-shot-for-health-staff/articleshow/86414297.cms||---

Forest veterinary doctor Sukumar, along with two other veterinarians, performed the autopsy on the spot in the presence of district forest officer (DFO) T K Ashok Kumar, other forest officials and representatives of NGOs on Tuesday. Sukumar said the tiger might had died at least five to seven days ago. The internal organs of the animal, he said, were eaten by maggots. “We did not find any fighting or bullet injuries on the carcass. It’s skin, 18 nails and all the teeth were intact. This isn’t a case of poaching. We don’t suspect any foul play behind the animal’s death.” He said they had collected scat from the animal’s rectum and food materials from the colon to see if the tiger was poisoned to death. “We couldn’t collect samples of any vital organs, as they were eaten by maggots. The collected samples will be sent to the forensic science laboratory for testing to ascertain the cause of death.” He said they could confirm the gender of the animal only after DNA analysis. As per the standard operating procedure of the National Tiger Conservation Authority, the carcass was cremated inside the reserve forest after the postmortem on the day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/coimbatore-tiger-found-dead-in-sirumugai-forest/articleshow/86409433.cms||A Subburaj

---||Delhi||Reading drive helps spread the word at childcare institutions||New Delhi: A reading drive by Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR), which has been going on for close to four weeks at childcare institutions (CCIs), has managed to teach letters to more than half of the children living there. The number of children being able to read paragraphs is now nearly three times more than the same during the launch of the programme in August. However, the improvement has been marginal when it comes to comprehending a story and answering questions. The campaign, launched on the lines of Mission Buniyaad of Delhi government schools, seeks to ensure that foundational literacy and numeracy of the children are class- and age-appropriate. Its pilot project is being carried out at CCIs of South and Southeast districts. Four mentor teachers of Delhi government schools are guiding the teachers at the shelter homes to implement the programme. The first stage covers teaching the foundation of Hindi and mathematics. DCPCR chairperson Anurag Kundu said, “There is improvement in children at initial level (beginner/letter). At the paragraph level, it is nearly three times. At all other levels, there is only marginal improvement.” Bhavna Sawnani, one of the mentor teachers, said the advanced level referred to reading a story, comprehending it and answering the questions based on it. “The children we worked with were from different age groups and backgrounds, and each one of them has gone through different traumas and circumstances. Those factors actually influence their learning,” said Sawnani. These children at the shelter homes are attached mostly to aided schools and attending online classes. “Attending online classes will not make sense for those who are below the paragraph level as they will not be able to understand and read. That’s why we are working at all levels,” she said. To make the campaign effective, an online refresher training for the teachers at these institutions was facilitated by the mentor teachers. This also helped CCI teachers share their challenges and get the doubts cleared.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/reading-drive-helps-spread-the-word-at-childcare-institutions/articleshow/86409418.cms||Shradha Chettri

Revchand’s 90-year-old paralysed mother Khemonbai, who was asleep in another room, was the sole survivor. While police are waiting for the report of the ongoing post mortem, they are not ruling out the possibility that even Revchand was murdered. The noose around Revchand’s neck was drawn over the door and tied to the window grill. The manner in which the noose was tied raised suspicion whether it was Revchand or someone else who was behind the murders. SP Vishwa Pansare said Revchand had a slanting ligature mark on the neck, which is a tell tale sign of hanging, but still cops will go by the opinion of the forensic experts. “The noose around Revchand’s neck is a matter of investigation. We are yet to come across any motive behind the crime,” said Pansare. “There were blood stains on the body and inner vest of Revchand, which indicate he may be involved in the murder,” said the SP, adding some mobile phones have been seized from the place. “We will ascertain the last call details and other analysis of the mobile phones for any relevant clues,” he said. The deaths came to fore when Revchand’s driver came to fetch some keys. Since no one was responding to his knocking, he peeped inside the window to see the bodies on the bed with blood around. He immediately raised an alarm. Cops said the preliminary findings say Revchand ended his life after murdering wife and two children with an iron rod which is generally used in tractors. The victims were probably killed in their sleep as they remained in resting position on the bed, said a cop. The blood-smeared weapon was found in the verandah of the house. Police are trying to ascertain whether Revchand, who owned a tractor and three pickup vans, used automobile spare parts from his own vehicle. The sole survivor in the house was Revchand’s mother, who is paralytic and bed-ridden. Police are still groping in the dark over a motive behind the crime. Offences of murder and accidental death were being registered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/transporter-ends-life-after-murdering-wife-two-children-in-gondia/articleshow/86409409.cms||Soumitra Bose

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Narcotic jihad: Suresh Gopi backs Kerala govt’s stand, BJP differs||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Actor-MP Suresh Gopi has once again put the BJP state unit in a fix by openly supporting chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and his government’s stand on Pala bishop’s controversial statement on ‘narcotic jihad’. “Chief minister need not react to all developments. A good sense prevails in the government. Chief minister and the ministers understand things in the right sense. Government is doing everything that is required in this regard. I don’t think I have to find fault with the state government every now and then. I will react only if the government’s intervention goes against the interests of the country,” Gopi told television reporters here on Tuesday. Vijayan, who initially questioned the rationale and basis of Pala bishop’s statement, however did not react to the opposition parties’ allegations that government was not taking a proactive step to douse the controversy. Media persons sought Gopi’s reaction to CM’s statement that government was not obliged to react to statements made by those occupying responsible positions. Talking to media persons at Kattappana in Idukki on Tuesday, Gopi reiterated that there was no need for the chief minister to react on each and every issue. Meanwhile, BJP state president K Surendran said that BJP stuck to the demand for an all-party meeting on the isssue raised by the bishop. “Both the ruling and opposition parties should clarify their stands on what Pala bishop said. The attempts to suppress the bishop’s right to raise issues that he thinks important should be resisted. The government and opposition should approach the issue with an open mind,” Surendran said. He however, refused to comment on Gopi’s reaction on the issue. BJP state general secretary George Kurian said the state government was taking a passive attitude against the rising misuse of narcotics. “Narcotics business is used to fund terrorism and the money thus made is used against the country. The son of a senior CPM leader is languishing in jail in a narcotic case. The state government is afraid that more investigation into narcotic deals would bring out more evidence against that leader’s son,” he said. Kurian reiterated BJP’s demand that state government should bring a piece of legislation against ‘love jihad’. “The fact that the term love jihad has not been defined as per law doesn’t mean the activities it refers to do not exist. It should be remembered that the Constitution has not defined religion per se,” he said. Kurian said it would be wrong to say that BJP was taking a stand against love marriage between people of different religions. “We are not against love or love marriage. We are against the practice of luring girls in the name of love with an intention to trap in marriage, only to be recruited to terror agencies later,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/narcotic-jihad-suresh-gopi-backs-govts-stand-bjp-differs/articleshow/86409483.cms||---

The youth managed to control his motorcycle or he would have fallen and his injuries could have been fatal. The youth was given 10 stitches at a private hospital, where he is undergoing treatment. Newly-appointed DCP (Kalyan region) Sachin Gunjal, who ordered a probe, said, “I have sought a report. Action will be taken depending on its findings.” On Monday evening, at Tisgaon naka, Nilesh Kadam and his friend Bhupendra Dhukre (25) were headed towards Ulhasnagar to buy firecrackers. Kadam told TOI, “When I reached the naka, on seeing a tempo, I took a left, when a cop posted there hit me with the lathi on my head.” Kadam said, “Fortunately, I controlled my motorcycle.

---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Students to be given degree after they plant sapling, says higher education minister Mohan Yadav||BHOPAL: In an initiative for environmental cause, the higher education department has decided to give degree and marksheet to students after they plant a sapling. Higher education minister Mohan Yadav told TOI on Tuesday during an exclusive talk. Yadav said that the objective of higher education is not just the academics but also to teach students about the tradition and culture. Q: The higher education department has taken several new initiatives. What are they?Yadav: Students will be given a degree and marksheet after they plant a sapling. This will inculcate a habit of respecting and conserving the environment. Institutes should compulsorily get their entry on the All India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE) portal. Its monitoring will be ensured at the directorate level. With this, changes can be brought in the GER of the state. Universities have been asked to adopt a village in their respective areas. Q: Colleges have been opened. What instructions have been given to colleges to follow Covid guidelines?Yadav: We have instructed the colleges to follow Covid guidelines in toto. We have started college with 50% attendance strength. As the students are of above 18 years of age they have been asked to submit certificate of at least first dose of vaccination. This is to ensure that students coming to the campus are vaccinated and safe. Q: Is it true that the state government is planning to change the name of vice-chancellors?Yadav: It is completely true. Vice-chancellors will be known as Kul Guru. We will put it in the cabinet soon. We have got informal approval also. Kul Guru is a term which has been in use for the past several years in our tradition. We just want our students to continue that tradition. I think this will also help in generating higher respect for prestigious positions like VC. Q: Controversy erupted over adding topics like Ramcharitmanas or engineering of Ram Setu in academics?Yadav: I do not understand the logic of creating any controversy on these topics. First of all, this is not mandatory for students to study. It is optional and available for any student of any stream to study. Besides, even if it is added I do not think there is any harm for students to study such a great legacy of Indian culture. Q: There is a dearth of teachers in colleges. What steps has the department taken in this regard?Yadav: We have decided to recruit more teachers through PSC. We are working on it and the vacancies will be issued soon in the near future. We will be able to fill the majority of the posts in the colleges in the near future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/students-to-be-given-degree-after-they-plant-sapling-min/articleshow/86407028.cms||Ramendra Singh

Her family members claimed that she had consumed poisonous substance due to a married man who had dated her and recorded her private videos, but police weren’t registering an FIR against him. Senior officials said they were questioning the suspect while a written statement from the victim’s family was still awaited. The woman, who was a Delhi University graduate, was found unconscious by her family in her room and taken to Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital where she died during treatment. The medical examination revealed that the woman had consumed some medicines that probably led to her death. Her family claimed Sumit, the suspect, had lied to the woman about his marital status. Family members said they had written to senior police officers demanding action against Sumit, who, they alleged, had been harassing them for months. “Her family has alleged that police are delaying action in the case. The woman’s younger sister even wrote to Delhi Police alleging that her sister consumed some medicines and told her that Sumit used to beat her, recorded her private videos and even threatened to upload them on social media,” said an officer. “Her father, who runs a footwear store, said his daughter had left Sumit this year and told him that he was married and cheated her,” the officer added. The family has also alleged they received several texts and calls from Sumit after she stopped living with him. Sumit even sent them her private photos and videos, the officer quoted her father as saying. Hours before the incident, the woman reportedly told her family that Sumit was in touch with an MP. The woman hasn’t left a suicide note, police said. Deputy commissioner of police (west) Urvija Goel said the woman’s family members were yet to give any written statement against Sumit. “Initial probe has revealed that Sumit lives near the woman’s house and has been married since 2013. We are questioning him,” Goel said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/23-year-old-kills-self-kin-say-she-was-being-blackmailed-allege-inaction-by-police/articleshow/86409485.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Dehradun||Locals opposed to new 4-km-long road, say it’ll destroy historic ‘Kipling Trail’||Mussoorie: The announcement of a 4-km-long road to connect Rajpur toll to Thalanigad village has drawn stiff opposition from local residents who said the project would damage the rich biodiversity of the region as well as destroy a “historic trek route”, commonly known as ‘Kipling Trail’ after author Rudyard Kipling. Chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami had recently announced construction of the road which would fall on the Rajpur-Jharipani trek route. The stretch was once the main route to reach Mussoorie before a motorable road to access the hill town was developed. It is also known as the Kipling Trail as Kipling took this stretch when he came to Mussoorie in the 1880s. Reenu Paul, president of the Rajpur Community Initiative, said, “Rajpur-Jharipani is a historic trek route, but if this road is constructed a part of this trek route would be merged with the road. It seems that this road is being proposed so commercial establishments and houses can be built near Thalanigad village.” Residents also argued that the area in which this road is proposed lies in the catchment of Rispana river and is also rich in biodiversity. “This would damage the catchment of Rispana,” said Kumud Shivpuri Taimni, a Rajpur resident. Paul suggested that another road has already reached nearby Chamasari village through another route and it would be better to connect Thalanigad through that road rather than damaging the historic trek.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/locals-opposed-to-new-4-km-long-road-say-itll-destroy-historic-kipling-trail/articleshow/86407076.cms||Anmol Jain

The report of the subcommittee, headed by IUML leader and former PWD minister MK Muneer, will be discussed by UDF at a meeting scheduled on Thursday Muneer told the media in Kozhikode on Tuesday that the project was not feasible and would put a huge financial burden on the state and also the future generations. The report is said to have pointed out that the project is expected to have huge cost overruns than the currently estimated figure of Rs 63,000 crore and will not be financially viable. It has also been said that as the Silverline project is going to use standard gauge, it cannot be integrated into the existing rail infrastructure of the country. Muneer said the state government has not even convened a meeting by inviting opposition parties to discuss the project. “The haste in which the government is trying to implement the project has raised suspicion if it has other intentions behind implementing a standard gauge project,” he said. He added that there were many alternative proposals for mass public transit like the suburban rail proposed by the earlier UDF government. Silverline is an ambitious project that aims to cover a distance of 530km from Kasaragod to Thiruvananthapuram in less than four hours. The project is facing criticism from a section of activists and the public over the huge costs involved amid fears of causing environmental damage. The project will require 3418 acres, including both railway and private land. Of the estimated project cost of Rs 63,941 crore, Rs 11,535 crore has been estimated for overall compensation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/k-rail-project-unviable-udf-subcommittee/articleshow/86409545.cms||---

The head constable identified as Ashwin Makwana, came under the scanner when locals of Shapar Veraval found him and the woman having private moments in the car on Shapar-Dholra road on Tuesday morning. The duo did not come out of the car, so the locals started recording the videos and informed the police. Makwana had a verbal altercation with the people and later when cops arrived, he argued with them as well. By Tuesday afternoon, the videos recorded by the locals became viral in the region. Police said that Makwana was brought to the police station where he was not able to stand nor was he able to speak properly. He later told cops that he had consumed alcohol. Police said that on Tuesday morning when Makwana was not on duty, he got drunk and took off in a police vehicle. He later picked up a girl and they headed towards Shapar-Dholra Road where they were later apprehended. “We have registered two different offences against Makwana. One is under the prohibition law and the other is for indulging in an obscene act in public and taking away government vehicle,” said deputy superintendent of police Pratipalsinh Zala. The woman, who later claimed to be a relative of Makwana, was also booked for the obscene act in public along with the cop.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/drunk-cop-runs-away-with-police-car-held-for-obscene-act/articleshow/86405671.cms||---

NIT-K has been developing electric vehicles indigenously and putting them to use in a big way, especially two-wheelers, to make the campus eco-friendly by reducing air and sound pollution. Now, alumi from 1970 and 1981 batches have come forward to give a further push to EV revolution in the campus. The NIT-K team has released some micro e-mobility vehicles like e-scooter, mini-scooter, e-bike of VidhYug series primarily for campus usage. E-cycle from the same series has been christened as VidhYug 3.0. Panduranga Vittal K, professor of electrical and electronics engineering department of NIT-K, and former dean alumni affair, told TOI that several alumni have shown interest to fund the EV venture. “The alumni will fund each EV project. This apart, they have also planned to fund several other projects at NIT-K,” he added. Pruthviraj U, assistant professor, WR and OE, NIT-K, said e-cycle VidhYug 3.0 was developed as a pilot study with funding from 1981-batch alumni. Explaining its features, Pruthviraj said the e-cycle was powered by a brushless DC motor initially (in the pilot stage). It will run on lithium-ion battery. Typical motor power and battery is 250W and 36V. Additionally, IRIS (integrated resource and information sharing, a system developed by NIT-K students) system has been integrated to the e-cycle. Its GPS module will enable the users to track its location within the campus. Also, students will be able to unlock and use the e-cycle by scanning the QR code. This code will also help in knowing the user and the usage (in hours). Further, brushless DC motor is planned to be replaced by switched reluctance hub motor. At present, one prototype has been developed. Keeping in mind the charging requirements, a solar farm is planned to be built, complete with solar-assisted EV charging stations to encourage the acquisition and use of plug-in vehicles. “The 1970-batch alumni have assured us Rs 18 lakh donation to support this venture,” said Pruthviraj.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/nit-k-to-get-alumni-push-for-evs-at-campus/articleshow/86406861.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

Mohammed Mukthar, partner, Reem Traders, told TOI, “Not only the Afghan crisis, there are several other factors that are responsible for the rise in the prices of dry fruits. For instance, the price of American Almonds which was around Rs 650-700 per kg has increased to Rs 900-950 in the retail market. During Covid, several international vessels were stranded that led to a major supply delay.” “Though a bumper crop of raisins has been reported, Indian traders have increased its price by around 10%. The price of broken cashew (4-piece and 8-piece) that is used for garnishing and has high demand in the sweet and confectionery industry has also increased by an approximate 15%. Hence, for the festive season, corporates may either have to increase their budgets or will have to gift lesser quantities. However, we are confident that it is going to be a good year,” he said. On the impact of the Afghan crisis on the industry, Ahmed Hussain, partner, expressed confidence that the import issues will be sorted out at the earliest as currently it is only about the bank transactions. A policy may soon be put in place, he said. Further he explained, the season’s crop had already arrived in India before the Afghan crisis broke. “Imports continue to arrive by road through the Wagah-Attari border, but in lesser quantities. However, of late, there is a delay in customs clearance. Though Afghan dealers are willing to sell their products, we have put business on hold and are hoping that the banking issue is settled,” he said. India mainly imports figs from Afghanistan that are sold in a huge volume. Apricots are imported mainly from Turkey and Afghanistan. Though India grows raisins in large quantities, the quality of Afghan raisins is superior because of the soil and weather conditions. Among super premium products, pine nuts are imported. A lot of medicinal herbs and asafoetida come from Afghanistan, Mukthar said. Shazil Lafrulla, MD, Sheen, a dry fruit wholesaler in Bengaluru said, with Covid-19, the demand for dry fruits saw a rise. “The current issues due to the Afghan crisis could be a temporary one. Though the prices have shot up by 20 %, we are hoping for a good festive season,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/ahead-of-festive-season-dry-fruit-dealers-worried-over-rising-prices/articleshow/86407019.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv

The letter, according to Bhatt, was for information and record of BCG that the new constitution has come into force from September 16. The chairman of BCG had stayed the extraordinary general meeting that was called last week to discuss and adopt the new constitution. However, the BBA went ahead and adopted the constitution in a meeting that turned into a stormy affair and several members walked out if it to protest the new constitution. Despite the ruckus, the bar association had declared that they had adopted the new constitution. The meeting had been stayed as one of the members Harshad Parmar had appealed to BCG that the office-bearers are serving an extended term in absence of election due to the pandemic and they cannot take any policy decision during this term. The bar council had stayed the meeting and had asked the BBA to respond to it on October 3. The association did not pay any heed to the order and went ahead with the meeting as it stated that the BCG cannot have jurisdiction over it as BBA is an independent and autonomous body.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/fuel-added-to-fire-in-bcg-bba-tussle/articleshow/86405078.cms||---

BJP members have alleged there was “favouring” of contractor for the project. Prabhakar Shinde, BJP group leader (BMC), plans to move the Bombay high court against the panel’s decision to clear the contract without giving his party members a chance to speak. TimesViewThe BEST committee cleared eight proposals worth Rs 120 crore in three minutes on Tuesday. It should ideally place every single proposal for detailed discussion and scrutiny before clearing it as it involves crores of rupees of public money. There should be no room for doubt nor any allegations of proposals being hurriedly cleared for vested interests, and every panel member must be taken into confidence.Senior BJP panel member Sunil Ganacharya told TOI, “BEST could have saved Rs 35 crore on the contract had it awarded the same to a vendor suggested by ASRTU (Association of State Road Transport Undertaking) which would have implemented the project at 7 paise per ticket. Instead, it went for the tendering process to finalise rates at 14 paise per ticket.” He said he was not allowed to speak/protest at the online meeting in which panel chairman Ashish Chemburkar cleared the proposal “in haste”. Shinde alleged the BEST administration had ignored international companies. “Due to the criteria set for a particular contractor, only 3 out of 20 interested bidders participated in the tender. Companies with an annual turnover of over Rs 3,000 crore were disqualified by showing bogus reasons,” he said, adding that “the BEST committee cleared 8 proposals worth Rs 120 crore in three minutes. This is a record for corruption.” Chemburkar denied all charges on behalf of BEST, saying the administration had followed “due diligence”. “Of 20 bids, three were qualified for technical bids and those who failed to submit proper documents and fulfil certain criteria were disqualified,” he said. Incidentally, BMC opposition leader Ravi Raja, who is from Congress, supported the BEST administration, saying all his apprehensions regarding the contract were addressed by BEST and he had no objection to the contract. When contacted, BEST general manager Lokesh Chandra said ASRTU’s suggestion of the vendor did not fulfil the criteria/requirements. “Had we gone for an ASRTU vendor, the commuters would have paid more hidden charges for the digital tickets. Besides, the contract which was finalised also involves providing a detailed commuter-friendly app — which will help one book tickets from home before boarding the bus, check for crowding/seat availability in buses, plan routes, and also a security feature of SOS button for women commuters in distress. The pressing of the SOS button in the app will alert the BEST control room and the police to take necessary action,” he said, adding that the agency which won the bids will provide the detailed app. The GM said the agency will also provide smartcards which will comply with the National Common Mobility card — one card for all modes of transport like buses, Metro, Railways, etc. “The firm will be monitored periodically for six years and if there is any fault, we can always penalise it during the contract period,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bjp-cries-graft-as-best-panel-oks-rs-85-crore-digital-ticketing-tender/articleshow/86412722.cms||Somit Sen
---||Coimbatore||Tamil Nadu: Tirupur researchers stumble upon fifth century sculptures||COIMBATORE: Independent archaeological researchers from Tirupur have stumbled upon two stone sculptures, which were abandoned and covered by bushes for years, in Anjur village on the western bank of Noyyal River at Kodumudi circle bordering Tirupur and Erode districts. The sculptures depicting women in dancing postures holding white fly whisks (ven saamaram) are estimated to be from the fifth century AD. Going by the stone carving and design, they are rare sculptures. According to S Ravikumar, director of Virarajendran Archeological and Historical Research Centre in Tirupur, it was Anjur Pandeeswarar temple administrator Thangamuthu who alerted them about the sculptures. Subsequently, Ravikumar, K Ponnusamy and Sakthiprakash visited the village recently and found the sculptures, which were covered by thorny bushes, behind Kottravai Temple. “Since the sculptures were found on the rear side of the 10th century temple, we can assume that the women depicted were thvarapalagai,” Ravikumar said. He said one the sculptures was 150cm high and 45cm wide and the woman was seen placing her left leg straight and right leg in a bent posture. “In her right hand, she is holding the ven saamaram. Her left hand is kept on her thigh in ‘uru haistha’ sign. The woman is wearing a ‘idaikachu’ dress and on the right side of the dress there is a purse for keeping pooja materials. She is wearing the ‘kuzhai’ type earrings and her neck is adorned with kandigai and sarapalli-type ornaments." The other sculpture is 120cm high and 60cm wide and the woman is seen with both her legs in straight posture as in ‘cadhura nadana’ (square dance) sign. She is holding the ven saamaram on her left hand. Archaeological expert and former assistant commissioner of state archaeological department R Poongundran, who examined the sculptures, said, “Both the sculptures with the bodies of women in slightly bent posture could belong to the late fifth century AD.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/5th-century-stone-sculptures-found-near-temple/articleshow/86409510.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: Over 350 die trying to cross railway tracks in 9 months||NEW DELHI: It was around 11.50 am on Tuesday when Sarai Rohilla (railways) police station received a call that a body was lying on the track in Mangolpuri. A police team reached the spot and found the body of a 45-year-old man with his head crushed. Officers said the man was crossing the track and was hit by a train that was going to Old Delhi railway station. According to recent data of Delhi Police, 358 people died till September 15 this year while they were crossing railway tracks in the city. “They included 329 men and 29 women. Last year, 410 people, including 42 women, died,” the data shows. An officer said most of them were factory workers and residents who lived in slum clusters near railway tracks. “Most of the bodies were recovered from the tracks situated in Sabzi Mandi (78), followed by Sarai Rohilla (75), Delhi Cantt (64), Hazrat Nizamuddin (51), Old Delhi (50), Anand Vihar (32) and New Delhi (8),” the data shows. “Most of the time, we recover bodies in the morning or evening. It is the time when workers go to factories or return homes using railway tracks,” the officer added. According to the data, 257 bodies were identified and 102 remained unidentified this year. Only one suicide case was reported. “We follow proper Covid guidelines while handling unidentified bodies,” the officer claimed. On Tuesday, when the TOI team visited the Nangloi railway station around 2.40 pm, about 50 schoolchildren, who were returning home, were seen crossing the tracks. Barely metres away, there was a foot overbridge (FOB), but few people were using it. Ashish (40), who lives in the station block area, was among those who were crossing the tracks. “For the last 30 years, I have been using this track to cross. I am not the only person. Everyone here uses the same route,” he said. Aslam, who works in an office, was also walking on the rails. When he was asked why he takes so much risk, he replied that he crosses the tracks only after a train passes the station. “I ignore FOB as it involves a long walk,” he said. Govind, who lives in Prem Nagar, said he was having leg pain so he avoided using FOB. Some people said that these tracks were shortcuts for them to reach another part of the city. According to officers, they registered more than 20 cases of trespassing at the Nangloi railway station last month. “There are half a dozen schools in this area. Every morning, children cross the tracks to reach their schools,” an officer added. Deputy commissioner of police (railways) Harendra Kumar Singh said most deaths took place while people were crossing the tracks. “We take various steps to avoid such accidents. We educate people, patrol the tracks to the best possible extent,” he stated. Another official said it was not possible to man 130 kilometres of tracks. “People use unmanned tracks to cross, which sometimes results in casualties. Some people also remain preoccupied with their mobile phones and become victims of train accidents.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/fatal-error-over-350-die-trying-to-cross-railway-tracks-in-9-months/articleshow/86409524.cms||Abhay Singh

In 2017-2018, Uttarakhand exported products worth Rs 10,836 crore and the amount increased to Rs 15,914 crore in 2020-21. Dhami said that objective of the commerce festival was to focus on economic development and to promote exports from India. “Despite the difficult geographical conditions and transportation constraints, Uttarakhand is growing rapidly in terms of exports year after year,” the CM said. Automobile and pharma units have emerged as the largest exporting sectors in the state, he said. “Apart from this, Uttarakhand exports flowers, items that involve agricultural and food processing, organic products, aromatic-medicinal plants, biotechnology products and handicrafts,” he said. Dhami added that Uttarakhand had become a preferred investment destination in North India due to its progressive policy framework, availability of quality manpower and good law and order. “The manufacturing sector contributes more than 36 per cent to the state’s GSDP,” the CM said, adding that the government is also focusing on improving the service sector’s contribution to its economy and the tourism sector has been given industry status. Uttarakhand is one of the top states in the Business Reform Action Point Rankings conducted by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/uttarakhand-doubled-exports-in-last-5-yrs-cm-dhami-at-commerce-festival/articleshow/86407144.cms||Kautilya Singh

Police from across the state usually send puppies to the city to train them in tracking murders and other crimes, narcotics, and explosives. Separate training is provided in these three areas and the duration of each course is six months. Each sniffer dog is handled by two handlers. The two-year-old female Doberman breed was sent to the centre six months ago. The dog was named Roony and provided training in detecting narcotic drugs, especially marijuana. Following the passing out parade, detective dog training centre sub-inspector Kamaraj and the dog handlers took Roony to the office of city police commissioner Deepak M Damor, who handed over the certificate to the dog handlers. Presently, two sniffer dogs each from the Trichy and the Nilgiris police, one each from the Thiruvarur police, Erode police and Salem central prison are undergoing training at the centre. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/sniffer-dog-roony-gets-1st-posting-after-completing-training/articleshow/86409557.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Waqf board plea in HC over Central Vista||New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Tuesday granted time to the Centre to respond to a plea by Delhi Waqf Board seeking the preservation and protection of its heritage properties likely to be impacted by the ongoing Central Vista Redevelopment Project. The board has sought the preservation and protection of six of its properties in the area within which the redevelopment work was ongoing. The properties are Masjid Zabta Ganj at Mansingh Road, Jama Masjid at Red Cross Road, Masjid Sunehri Bagh Road Near Udyog Bhawan, Mazar Sunehri Bagh Road behind Moti Lal Nehru Marg, Masjid Krishi Bhawan inside Krishi Bhawan Compound and Masjid Vice President at the official residence of the vice president of India. Solicitor Tushar Mehta, representing the central government, told Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva that he would take instructions on the board’s petition in a week after which HC posted the matter next on September 29. The wakf board urged that assurance may be given by the solicitor general with respect to the protection of the properties till then. “Why should he give an assurance? This is an indirect stay. The project is continuing in a particular fashion. There is a timeline. They would have taken it (the structures) into account,” the court said, adding that a stay on the project has already been refused by the Supreme Court and the high court. Senior advocate Sanjoy Ghose, representing the board, said that his client, in no manner, intended to impede the ongoing project but merely sought a “clarification that the government would honour the integrity of these places of worship.” He said that one of the structures even housed the remains of Dr Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed, the fifth President of India and the father of former high court judge Badar Durez Ahmed. “The waqf properties, subject matter of the present petition, are all more than 100 years old and are continuously being used for religious purposes. It is not the case that the government buildings were built first and thereafter these properties came into existence. On the contrary, these properties were well in existence when the Government buildings were constructed around them or in the vicinity,” said the petition filed through lawyer Wajeeh Shafiq. It said that the representations sent by the board seeking assurance about the properties had not been responded to in spite of the expiry of over two months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/waqf-board-plea-in-hc-over-central-vista/articleshow/86409628.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Bhopal||Union minister L Murugan files papers for Rajya Sabha bypoll in Madhya Pradesh||BHOPAL: Union minister of state for information and broadcasting, L Murugan, on Tuesday filed his nomination papers for the Rajya Sabha byelection from Madhya Pradesh. He is expected to be elected unopposed as Congress has said it won’t field any candidate. Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Union minister Prahlad Patel, BJP state chief Vishnu Dutt Sharma and other party leaders accompanied Murugan to the assembly where he submitted the papers to returning officer and principal secretary of assembly, Awadhesh Pratap Singh. The RS seat fell vacant after Thawar Chand Gehlot was appointed Governor of Karnataka in July. Murugan was made a Union minister in the cabinet reshuffle that month and this necessitated his election to Parliament in six months. Earlier this month, the Election Commission announced that bypolls to seven Rajya Sabha seats, including one in MP, would be held on October 4. The last date for nomination is September 22. BJP named Murugan, a former Tamil Nadu party chief, as its candidate on September 18. MP BJP president V D Sharma welcomed his nomination, saying the BJP leadership has decided that Madhya Pradesh “would give strength to Tamil Nadu”. “I am very grateful to the central leadership, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah and party national president J P Nadda for this decision. Madhya Pradesh is fortunate to have Murugan ji as party candidate for Rajya Sabha. A Scheduled Caste leader, he has worked in Tamil Nadu to nurture nationalist ideals and has played an important role in the expansion of the BJP organization,” said Sharma. Murugan thanked the BJP leadership for giving him an opportunity to enter Rajya Sabha and said there is no difference between the culture of South and North India. Sharma hit out at Congress, saying: “Congress is terrified that if it fields any candidate, then the remaining MLAs might go here and there. Kamal Nath ji has captured the entire organisation. He feels that if someone else fights the bypoll, he will be highlighted,” said Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/murugan-files-papers-for-rs-bypoll-in-state/articleshow/86407193.cms||---

With the United States relaxing the travel ban in November for air travelers from 33 countries including China, India, Brazil and most of Europe who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19, parents are planning their maiden trip to campuses where their wards have recently started classes. The frenzy to fly out to the USA is higher among parents of freshmen who have gone for their undergraduate education. “My daughter completed her first year online from home. But flew out in February and is now in the second year. But as soon as the travel ban is lifted, we are leaving for the US to be with her,” said Sarkar. The White House said on Monday that it was easing the tough pandemic-related restrictions that started early last year. While a precise start date for the new rules is not out, the White House stated that they would be eased from “early November”; many details of the new policy are still being decided. “The US Consulate must resume B1, B2 visa applications so that parents who want to visit their children can do so. Many students would be graduating in December and parents will definitely not want to miss being a part of their convocation,” said international education counsellor Karan Gupta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-parents-make-plans-to-visit-wards-as-the-us-relaxes-travel-ban/articleshow/86411780.cms||---

This is because the All Kerala Rice Millers Association did not enter into agreement with Supplyco, the nodal agency for paddy procurement, citing that some of the agreed demands were not included in the agreement. There are 49 rice mill owners who had agreed to procure paddy from farmers and process it as rice and return it to Supplyco for a fixed processing charge. But three rice mills, who are not members of the association, entered into agreement with Supplyco on Monday. Meanwhile, the farmers organizations have alleged attempts by some officials of Supplyco and the private rice mill owners to delay paddy procurement and force the farmers to sell their produce at a lower price in the open market. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/procurement-of-paddy-delayed/articleshow/86409611.cms||---

---||Delhi||Why You’re In Driving Seat In Fight Against Pollution||New Delhi: With winter approaching, Delhi government’s transport department is gearing up to put polluting vehicles off the roads of Delhi. If your vehicle doesn’t have a valid Pollution Under Control Certificate, it is a good time to get one. The transport department issued a notice on Sunday warning vehicle owners that if caught driving a car without a valid PUCC, they would not only be left poorer by Rs 10,000, but also have their driving licence suspended for three months or face imprisonment up to six months.“The Graded Response Action Plan for fighting air pollution is expected to be implemented from mid-October and the notice to vehicle owners is part of our plan to ensure there are no polluting vehicles on the road in the winter. The notice gives motorists ample time to get the PUCC,” an official said.The department prosecutes vehicles without PUCC or are visibly polluting throughout the year, but special drives are carried out during the winter months. Extensive drives are likely to begin soon and besides implementation across the city, there will be focused drives at pollution hotspots, according to the official.Last year, at least one enforcement team each was deployed permanently at the city’s pollution hotspots identified by Delhi Pollution Control Committee, among them Anand Vihar, RK Puram, Jahangirpuri, Vivek Vihar and Mayapuri.While the department’s notice has sent car owners rushing to PUC centres, glitches are also being reported. “The rush isn’t as great as in May last year,” said the official. “A large number of vehicles in Delhi now are Bharat Stage IV compliant and are required to get a pollution check done only once a year, unlike every three months earlier.”The official said that while the Union ministry of road transport and highways had extended the validity of motor vehicle documents such as a driving licence and permits till September 30, Delhi government’s transport department hasn’t made an exception for the PUCC, keeping in mind Delhi’s fight against air pollution. “Vehicle owners should not be under the impression that they will be spared if they do not have a PUCC for their car,” he said.While the department has cracked down on polluting vehicles in the last few years, the Covid pandemic has resulted in the number of errant vehicles coming down. The number of vehicles penalised for not carrying a valid PUCC increased from 9,221 in 2016 to 14,938 in 2017, 15,785 in 2018 and up to 16,497 in 2019. The figure halved to 8,237 last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-youre-in-driving-seat-in-fight-against-pollution/articleshow/86407320.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Bhopal||No work gets done in MP without give & take: Nath||Bhopal: PCC chief Kamal Nath launched a scathing attack on chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan for his instructions to state officials on good governance. During the collector-commissioner conference held on Monday, the chief minister had told the bureaucracy that his policy towards corruption is of ‘zero tolerance’. Taking to Twitter on Monday, Nath said, “In the Shivraj-led government in Madhya Pradesh, ‘suraj’ (good governance) means that no work is done without a give & take deal and all work gets delayed. It is surprising and shameful that a chief minister for 16 years is having to give a lesson on good governance to officials of the state and having to say that ‘I know who has taken bribes, I will not spare them’.” Nath also reacted to Chouhan’s statement that his government is in full form for developmental works. “The chief minister is saying that now the government has to be in full form for development and public welfare. Then Shivraj ji, in what form were you in the past 16 years, even in 16 years you could not come in full form?” he tweeted. Speaking about his 15-month government in the state, the former chief minister said, “People are witness to how we destroyed the mafia in our full form government of 15 months, while even after 16 years, you are still asking officials to take action against the mafia, illegal mining and against criminals? This reveals your failure and helplessness.” Nath said, “In MP, corruption is not just in the PM Awas Yojana, today corruption is at its peak in implementation of each and every scheme, in every department and in every district where no work gets done without some dealing”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/no-work-gets-done-in-mp-without-give-take-nath/articleshow/86407270.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Pandemic manpower crunch hits Kolkata Municipal Corporation’s desiltation drive||KOLKATA: Residents who suffered one of the worst inundations in a decade could have fared better had Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) taken up the regular desilting of sewer lines that is necessary to clear clogged drains. KMC sewerage and drainage department officials conceded a massive desilting work that was initiated in 2015 and continued till 2019 came to a halt last year due to the pandemic. In fact, the desilting scheme had extracted 8.5 lakh tonnes of silt from across the city in five years (2015 to 2019). “From 2010 to 2014, KMC had extracted only 1.8 lakh tonnes of silt. Extraction of record silt during 2015-19 led to an improved drainage capacity which ultimately reduced the waterlogging woes,” said Tarak Singh, a member in the KMC board of administrators (BoA) overseeing the civic body’s sewerage and drainage network. However, the pandemic changed the course of the drive for the past two years. “We couldn’t afford to rope in our manpower or machines required to conduct a thorough desilting of our sewer and drainage lines in past two years due to the existing pandemic. Otherwise, there could have some relief from inundation in various pockets of the city,” said a KMC drainage department official. In fact, sources in the KMC headquarters maintained that most of trained members of a central manual sewer cleaning gang had gone back to their families in Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha last year after a complete lockdown was declared across the country.  “This 250-member strong gang assists our department in locating clogged sewer and drainage lines and accordingly we take up extensive desilting progammes at the onset of winter so that we can give relief to residents during monsoon. However, without the help of this gang, the desilting programme took a backseat,” the civic official said. This gang apart, the KMC drainage department has 450 drainage department labourers in 10 boroughs who often assist in cleaning of manholes. These labourers couldn’t be roped in during the peak of the pandemic, said a civic official. “Besides, without the help of trained manpower, the civic body couldn’t press into service effective machines like jetting cum suction, gully-pit emptier and bucket machines, among others, which would have given relief to citizens even after heavy showers,” said a KMC drainage department official. The KMC official expressed concern over the heavily clogged canals that bear the load of city’s storm water. “We have a 134-km long canal network that is being shared jointly by KMC and adjoining municipalities and municipal corporations like BMC, south Dum Dum and Rajpur-Sonarpur, among others. Once the rain becomes heavy and uniform, the canals fail to bear the load,” the civic official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pandemic-manpower-crunch-hits-kmcs-desiltation-drive/articleshow/86407312.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Chandigarh||As water level swells, Chandigarh opens Sukhna floodgates||CHANDIGARH: As water in Sukhna lake approached the danger mark of 1,163 feet, the UT engineering department opened floodgates on Tuesday. Rain over the last few days increased water level at Sukhna lake. One of the three floodgates was opened on Tuesday morning when the water level reached 1,162.65 feet. The gate was closed after some time when the water level reduced. UT chief engineer C B Ojha said the gate was opened as a precautionary measure to prevent a flood like situation in areas like Baltana and Zirakpur. Earlier, the gates were opened on August 14 and August 9 this year. The two floodgates had to be opened in August last year after water level of the lake crossed the danger mark. Before this, on September 24, 2018, incessant rain in the catchment area forced officials to open the two floodgates. At the time, the gates were opened after 10 years. After opening of the floodgates, Sukhna Choe carries the excess water to Ghaggar river. Last year, floodgates were opened when the water level reached 1,163.4 feet and a current led to flooding in Baltana area of Mohali district. To prevent a repeat of such a situation, authorities decided to release water in small amounts, sources in the department said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/as-water-level-swells-ut-opens-sukhna-floodgates/articleshow/86407274.cms||---
---||Kochi||SAAC panel to visit Bishop Moore College for assessment||Thiruvananthapuram: The State Assessment and Accreditation Centre (SAAC) set up under Kerala state higher education council is all set to become fully operational. A panel of experts deputed by the centre would pay its first visit as part of the accreditation and assessment to Bishop Moore College, Mavelikkara, on September 23 and 24. After years of deliberations, the state higher education council had set up SAAC in 2019, on the lines of National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) instituted by the University Grants Commission (UGC) to rank higher education institutions based on their academic excellence as well as infrastructure facilities. After initial dilly dallying, the former LDF government had declared SAAC validation mandatory for higher education institutions if they wish to branch out further. A team chaired by Prof Renganath H Anne Gowda, former director, former director, NAAC, would visit Bishop Moore College, which has completed the formalities for the SAAC validation. Other members in the visiting panel are MG University vice-chancellor Prof Sabu Thomas, Kannur University former VC Prof Michael Tharakan and former professor of Calicut University Prof Fathimathu Zuhara. Unlike NAAC that evaluates the competence of institutions on a seven-points scale, the SAAC would evaluate colleges using a 10-points scale. The additional points adopted by SAAC include scientific temper and secular outlook, equity and excellence and social inclusiveness. The additional criteria would look into the minority, non-minority representation, gender distribution, qualification and salary of teaching and non-teaching staff, adversity factors and achievement gap. While assessing the scientific temper and secular outlook of the institution, the evaluators would look into the role played by the particular institute in strengthening and promoting secular outlook and constitutional values. The attempt to gauge the scientific temper and secular outlook of institutions as part of the academic assessment process had invited criticism from a section of academics, who said it would be hard to make an objective assessment on such matters. “At least a dozen leading colleges in the state have applied for the assessment and accreditation by SAAC. We hope to complete the ranking of at least 10 institutions by October,” said the higher education council member secretary Rajan Varughese. A survey conducted by the council had found out that there are 1,500 odd higher education institutions in the state. Of these, several institutions have not been assessed and accredited by any agencies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/saac-panel-to-visit-bishop-moore-college-for-assessment/articleshow/86407341.cms||B S Anilkumar

A division bench of justices M Duraiswamy and K Murali Shankar ordered notice to the state government on the petition filed by T Ponprakash, of Tirunelveli district. The petitioner stated that he joined the judicial service as a civil judge in 1991. He was promoted as a principal district judge of Ramanathapuram district in 2014. Thereafter, he was transferred and posted at the family court in Dindigul district in 2015. He stated that he was suspended from service in 2016 and subsequently a charge memo was issued to him with 12 charges raising an allegation against him for corruption and misuse of power. He stated that he was not permitted to retire on superannuation in 2017, due to the pendency of the disciplinary proceedings. After the completion of the proceedings, the inquiry officer held that only a part of the first charge, part of the fourth charge and charge number nine were proved, out of the total 12 charges. The alleged charges pertain to receipt of a gold ring in the name of head clerk of Ramanathapuram principal district court, receipt of pant and shirt from advocate association while inspecting the munsif court at Kamuthi and receipt of the wifi modem while inspecting the munsif court at Ramanathapuram. Accepting the findings of the inquiry officer, the administrative committee of the Madras high court concluded that he was found guilty of serious misconduct and recommended major punishment of dismissal from service and the same was followed by the full court. The government by GO dated February 8, 2020, had dismissed him from service.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/dismissed-former-judge-challenges-punishment/articleshow/86409687.cms||---
---||Nagpur||WHO strengthens air pollution norms to save millions of lives, fight climate change||Nagpur: For the first time in 15 years, the World Health Organization (WHO) has revised its Global Air Quality Guidelines aiming to save millions of lives across the world and combat climate change. Attributing around 7 million pre-mature deaths every year to ambient and household air pollution, the WHO has recommended new air quality levels to protect the health of populations by reducing levels of key air pollutants, some of which also contribute to climate change. WHO said there has been a marked increase of evidence that shows air pollution is affecting different aspects of health. After a systematic review of the accumulated evidence, WHO has “adjusted all the air quality guidelines levels downwards.” Setting a threshold for key air pollutants, WHO’s new guidelines recommend air quality levels for six pollutants, where evidence has advanced the most on health effects from exposure. Compared to 2005 levels, the latest recommended annual level for particulate matter (PM) 2.5 has been halved. From 10 micrograms per cubic meter (mpcm), it is now 5mpcm for all the countries. When it comes to 24-hour guidelines, the level has been reduced to 15 from 25 mpcm. In case of PM10, the annual new level is 15 mpcm against the previous 20 mpcm while the 24-hour latest level is 45 mpcm against the earlier 50 mpcm. Stating that the health risks associated with particulate matter equal or smaller than 10 and 2.5 microns in diameter are of particular public health relevance, WHO in a release stated, “Both PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀ are capable of penetrating deep into the lungs but PM₂.₅ can even enter the bloodstream, primarily resulting in cardiovascular and respiratory impacts, and also affecting other organs. PM is primarily generated by fuel combustion in different sectors, including transport, energy, households, industry, and from agriculture.” Apart from particulate matter, WHO has also issued revised levels for toxic greenhouse gases which have been a major culprit in rising global warming. Sulphur dioxide, which is largely emitted from coal-fired power plants, should now be at 40 mpcm while carbon monoxide, ozone and nitrogen dioxide are to be at 4, 60 and 25 mpcm respectively. The organization added that air pollution was one of the biggest environmental threats to human health, alongside climate change. “Improving air quality can enhance climate change mitigation efforts, while reducing emissions will in turn improve air quality. By striving to achieve these guideline levels, countries will be both protecting health as well as mitigating global climate change,” the organization stated. Though these guidelines are not legally-binding, almost 80% of deaths related to PM2.5 could be avoided in the world if the current air pollution levels were reduced to those proposed in the updated guideline. As per data, over 90% of the world’s population live in areas that exceed the WHO limits. Unfortunately, for South Asia, this is approximately 100%. According to Greenpeace, at least 79 of the world’s 100 most polluted cities breached the WHO’s annual PM2.5 levels of 2005. “Moreover, last year, PM2.5 breached 2021 annual mean levels in all the world’s biggest 100 cities, in some cases by more than fifteen-fold,” the Greenpeace analysis said. The organization’s researchers estimate that 57,000 pre-mature deaths in New Delhi during 2020 can be attributed to air pollution. The analysis done by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) highlights that nearly 2 million lives could have been saved in India annually if the WHO’s earlier guidelines were implemented. “It’s been more than a decade that India notified the national ambient air quality standards in 2009 and lot of new evidence on impact of different pollutants on human health at lower pollution levels have come into existence, necessitating Indian government to revise the standards similar to WHO’s action. The good thing is that India is already working on revising the standards, we just need to make sure we make use of evidence gathered by WHO and others on increasing and severe health impacts of pollutants at lower levels and try to aim towards moving closer to WHO prescribed levels for pollutants,” said Sunil Dahiya, analyst at CREA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/who-strengthens-air-pollution-norms-to-save-millions-of-lives-fight-climate-change/articleshow/86427815.cms||Manka Behl

Though the youths dived into the pond, smashed windowpanes and managed to drag out the quartet trapped inside, the car could be pulled out of the pond only on Tuesday morning — six hours later. The accident took place at Subhash Nagar in Anandapur at 10pm on Monday. Akash Roy alias Sunny was driving a red hatchback. Three of his friends — Rahul Gupta, Vicky Choudhary and Puja Thapa — were in the car. All four are in their early 20s and stay in Kasba and Mukundapur. They were headed to a Tagore Park pub when Roy misjudged a turning on a narrow lane from the Anandapur Service Road owing to heavy waterlogging and car fell in the pond face down. An officer said: “When their car reached Netaji Sporting Club at Anandapur, the occupants got confused as there was heavy waterlogging. They took a dead-end road instead of the adjoining road that led to the bar. This bylane ended up at the pond. Although this pond is barricaded, its main gate was open. Roy stuck to the road but drove directly into the pond.” The splash drew Mintu Sarkar, who stays right on the edge of the pond, out of his three-storey house. “Three of my other friends — Rajesh Shaw, Rithi Das and Subho Das — also came out. We realized that we needed to rescue the occupants. For the first few minutes, we could see the occupants crying for help as the car was sinking. We initially thought to tow out the car but realized that we had no equipment. The four of us jumped into the water. It was raining but we kept calm. At least 50-60 locals came out and they all lent a hand in rescuing all four," said Sarkar. Das said, “We could see the occupants screaming desperately. We did take a while to break open the lock - especially since it was raining, the water level was higher than normal, and the car had landed in that part of the pond where we usually do not swim. The elders here say that it is deep but at that moment, it seemed deeper. But had we waited for the police and fire department, it would have been late.” Police said all four trapped in the car escaped with no injuries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/youths-rescue-four-after-car-plunges-into-pond/articleshow/86407356.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Government augments district coordination committees||Thiruvananthapuram: With agencies such as PWD, KIIFB and RKI undertaking multiple infrastructure projects and the lack of coordination between them delaying the execution of such projects, government has decided to augment district coordination committees by christening them as the inter-agency linking body. As per the GO issued in this regard last week, in addition to district coordination committees chaired by collectors that have been put in charge of all public work projects in the district, two state-level nodal officers were appointed for smoothening the task, putting them in charge of seven districts each. “Mission mode implementation of these projects is vital to reap the envisaged benefits of investments. But, it is seen that the progress of projects is affected due to the delay in making land available, land acquisition, utility shifting, survey, demarcation and lack of sufficient coordination between various authorities,” said the order issued by PWD secretary Anand Singh. Land acquisition being the primary challenge, the committees have been asked to review the progress of land acquisition works of various projects and inform stakeholders on the follow-up action required. The committees would also be the link between various authorities involved in the project, and will be responsible for ensuring that permissions and approvals are granted by authorities, especially utility providers for seamless implementation of the project. It will be the responsibility of the committees to ensure that permission for cutting roads (in case of some projects) is given and those are restored in a time-bound manner. The committees will review and monitor overall implementation of the project, identify constraints and gaps in the project, and report progress to departments concerned. The committees were asked to take the help of MLAs in addressing issues on field during project implementation and develop district-level infrastructure transformation plans. The committee would include district development commissioner, deputy collector (land acquisition), deputy collector (land acquisition NH), project director NHAI, executive engineers of all PWD wings, project management unit Kerala road fund board and other infrastructure departments. It has been asked to involve all MLAs at the meetings of the committee. While DDC or the sub-collector will be the nodal officer for the committee, the executive engineer of PWD (roads) will be the convenor of the committees. The PWD minister and PWD secretary will take part in the meetings of the committees of each district once in two months. Also, RBDCK MD S Suhas and CEO of KRFB and project director KSTP S Sambasiva Rao were appointed as state-level nodal officers for overall supervision of the projects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/government-augments-district-coordination-committees/articleshow/86409742.cms||KP Saikiran

A division bench of justices M Duraiswamy and K Murali Shankar sought a response from the government on the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by R Suresh Kumar of Ramanathapuram district. The petitioner stated that there is an anomaly in the rules pertaining to qualification of PG assistants in the appointment at government and private schools, which are recognized by the government. He stated that the Tamil Nadu Recognized Private Schools Regulation Rules, prescribes the qualification as a masters degree in the subject in which the appointment is to be made. However, the state government had brought in amendment to the rules, in 2020, stating that people with bachelors and masters degrees in the same subjects would be appointed to the post of PG assistants at government schools. He stated that the capability of imparting education by teachers who have bachelor and masters degrees in the same subject would be higher when compared to those who have masters degree in one subject and bachelors degree in another subject. Though the government thought it fit to make such amendments for appointments in government schools, the same was not considered with respect to the educational qualification for the appointments made in recognised private schools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/amend-qualification-rules-for-pg-assts-plea/articleshow/86409695.cms||---

The government has decided to initiate a probe against the major archbishop of Syro Malabar Church and the head of archdiocese of Ernakulam-Angamaly after the high court dismissed the cardinal’s all seven petitions appealing against the lower courts’ orders. The Thrikkakara magistrate court and the Ernakulam sessions court had found improprieties in the sale of 60 cents of land in Kochi. The high court had directed the government to conduct an investigation into the matter through its investigating agencies so as to satisfy itself whether the settlement deed executed in 2007 was executed with respect to any government land or poramboke land. The court asked the government to set up a team possessing adequate knowledge in civil and criminal laws. The seven-member team is headed by assistant commissioner (land revenue) Beena P Anand, and also include district registrar (general), Ernakulam, Aby George, assistant commissioner of police, traffic west (Kochi) Vinod Pillai, senior superintendent (revenue department) S Jayakumaran, revenue inspector G Balachandran Pillai and senior clerks (revenue department) Shibu M and Manoj V M. The team has been asked to submit their report with the findings and recommendations to the government urgently. The case relates to the sale of 60 cents of property near Bharat Mata College, Thrikkakkara to a real-estate broker. The court issued the order based on a complaint filed by Joshy Varghese, a member of a church under the archdiocese. Varghese had alleged that the sale deed of the property was finalised without even receiving any payment and the property that belonged to the Ernakulam-Angamaly Archdiocese was sold without communicating with any of the church committees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/land-deal-govt-announces-probe-against-alencherry/articleshow/86407372.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Hawk eye on large construction sites to dust out winter pollution||NEW DELHI: Large construction sites, or those occupying over 20,000 sq metres, will have to be extra careful this winter. Pollution monitoring agencies will specially focus on them to see they follow the norms for controlling dust, whose contribution to the total PM10 pollutants in Delhi touches 31% in winters. Construction agencies have been given 15 days by environment minister Gopal Rai to adopt the dust guidelines, but the government may also be looking to incorporate suggestions made by a dust management committee into the winter action plan. This could make it mandatory for large construction sites to install live pollution reading sensors to provide real-time data monitored by Delhi Pollution Control Committee. In August first week, the dust management panel comprising experts from IIT Delhi, The Energy and Resources Institute and DPCC submitted a plan recommending the issue of warning to construction projects if the PM10 and PM2.5 levels at the site were over 25% of the air quality readings at the nearest monitoring station. It suggests that if corrective action is not taken within 24 hours of the first warning issued, the construction site should be shut down, alongside penalties imposed. A government official said possible penal measures for contravention of the norms will form part of the winter action plan, which will be ready before September 30. “Once the plan is finalised, we will look at other aspects of controlling dust pollution,” said the official. Tuesday was the last day for agencies to submit suggestions for winter action plan, with the government official revealing that Rai and the environment department will now go through the proposals submitted. A DPCC official said in addition to the plan, an online portal was also being developed to monitor construction sites. “The aim is to make this portal operational by October. It will help us monitor and act on dust pollution from construction and demolition waste,” the official said. In a meeting last week, Rai met private construction agencies and asked them to hold review meetings at their construction sites to ensure Delhi government’s 14-point guideline on dust management was followed. He warned them of action if they were found violating the guidelines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hawk-eye-on-large-construction-sites-to-dust-out-winter-pollution/articleshow/86407346.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

---||India||Mahant’s accused disciple was held in Australia for ‘sex harassment’||HARIDWAR: At 15, Anand Giri decided to “renounce” worldly pleasures and turn into a sanyasi. His search for a guru as he embarked on his spiritual journey brought him to Haridwar where he met Narendra Giri, a mahant of Niranjani akhara, in 2000. Over the years, Anand, a scholar of Vedas and Sanskrit from Rajasthan’s Bhilwara district, came to be known as Giri’s closest disciple. But in 2020, the guru-shishya duo parted ways following years of disagreements and a bitter dispute over mutt property. On Monday, Anand was arrested after Giri, the head of the influential Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad, was found hanging in UP’s Baghambari mutt — that belongs to Niranjani akhara — with a suicide note alleging blackmail by his former disciple and two others. Anand, now 35, has been booked for abetment of suicide. “Their relationship had turned bitter in the last decade, leading Giri to expel Anand from the Baghambari mutt last year. But after Anand offered a public apology, he was reinstated,” said a seer. As Giri rose in stature in the past decade — from mahant to chief of the Akhara Parishad, the apex body of 13 akharas in India, in 2016 — so did his disciple. Often, he was seen riding luxury cars. Anand’s trips abroad too, became frequent in the past decade. He would fly business class. In one such trip to Australia in 2018, Anand was arrested for allegedly sexually harassing a yoga student. Last year, a photo of Anand circulated online in which he was flying business class and “drinking”. His lifestyle was a bone of contention between him and Giri. Giri was also upset that Anand had not cut ties with his family, said a seer. He was married and had children. The two were embroiled in a bitter property dispute, with Anand opposing Giri’s decision to sell land of Baghambari mutt. Things came to a head when Giri accused him of financial irregularities. “The Akhara Parishad chief suspected that Anand had used mutt money to build his own ashram in Haridwar,” said a seer. Once Anand was expelled, he was quoted in media this year claiming to have videos of sadhus, including Giri, engaging in “immoral activities”. But things seemed to have settled down in May this year when a compromise was made between the two in Lucknow in the presence of a former MLA from the Samajwadi Party SP, another leader from the BJP and a senior police officer. The accused has claimed that he has been framed by people angry over his opposition to sale of the mutt land to private individuals.

A division bench of justices M Duraiswamy and K Murali Shankar was hearing a public interest litigation filed by P Rajasekaran, secretary of Thenkarai Vivasayigal Sangam. The petitioner stated that the total extent of the Periyakulam irrigation tank is nearly 350 acres and it is fed with water from the Sothuparai dam through the Raja Vaikkal. When the Periyakulam tank reaches its full capacity, water is also fed to the subsidiary tanks such as Pappipatti and Thamaraikulam tanks. This water is not only used for agricultural purpose but also stored in these tanks, which has played a vital role in increasing the groundwater level in the area. He stated that several people have encroached the water catchment area inside the tank they are also closing the vent to prevent the water flow from the Sothuparai dam to the Periyakulam tank.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/plea-to-remove-encroachments-inside-tank-in-theni-district/articleshow/86409738.cms||---

Aiming to attract more enthusiasts, the ministry said besides a cash reward, a “name plaque” will be installed on the iconic structure mentioning the winner’s name. The government plans to develop the Nav Bharat Udyan (New India Garden) on 22.22 hectares along the Yamuna and it has set the target to complete it in 2022 to commemorate the 75th year of India’s independence. This is the second time the central public works department (CPWD) under the ministry has called for entries. Though in the earlier round, it had received several entries, the ministry claimed none of them met their expectations. “This is the first time we have included the provision to put the name of the individual winner, a group or a firm on the structure. That will have more value rather than just a cash prize,” said an official. According to the plan, the garden will be open to the public and it is being designed to have infotainment facilities such as sphere of unity, milestones walkway, journey of India, tech dome and open-air theatre, to showcase India’s rich historical and cultural heritage, scientific achievements and symbolise unity in diversity. The maximum permissible height at the proposed site is 134 metres from the present ground level. While addressing a webinar last week, Union housing and urban affairs secretary, Durga Shanker Mishra had said the structure should be such that one can see the India Gate and the entire Central Vista from there. The government announced Rs 5 lakh for the first prize and Rs 1 lakh each for five commendation prizes. “If design elements from various entries are selected, the prize money shall be equitably distributed to all the concerned participants,” the public works department said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/design-competition-for-iconic-structure-on-yamuna-bank-centre-invites-nris-architects/articleshow/86409774.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Neighbourhood still under water? Blame it on use of banned single-use plastic bags||Kolkata: Apart from heavy rain, the flooding of the city and its suburbs, experts said, was largely man-made. Kolkata is paying a high price for its citizens’ habit of throwing away plastic bags and other single-use plastic products. Despite the ban on plastic bags below the thickness of 50 microns, single-use plastic bag is the biggest threat to Kolkata’s drains. Single-use plastic is the only reason why water takes an inordinately long time to recede from different neighbourhoods despite massive desiliting drives. “This is particularly alarming when successive reports of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has been alerting on frequent inundation of the city and its suburbs because of the increasingly erratic rainfall,” said Ajaay Mittal, a climate-reality leader and director of Earth Day Network, India and South Asia. A recent drone survey carried out by Sadhan Ghosh of Jadavpur University and his team found how piles of thin plastic bags have assumed an alarming proportion in the city and its fringes and how they are going down the drain and ending up at landfill sites. “It is an understatement to say that the situation is alarming. Plastics are choking drains and polluting rivers. Microplastics (the miniscule plastic particles) are entering our food chain through fish and meat with an inevitable carcinogenic impacts on health,” said Ghosh, a waste-management expert and president of International Society of Waste Management, Air and Water. The drainage pumping stations were worst hit by plastic bags. “Apart from plastic bags, chocolate wrappers, plastic sachets of gutka and paan masalas are even more dangerous. They are slipping through the gully pit covers and gratings and getting into the underground sewerage system,” said a KMC drainage department official. In 2018, when Firhad Hakim became mayor, he decided to take a tough stand on the use of single use plastic bags. “It worked. Overnight the traders stopped using plastic bags. But it somehow fizzled out when the mayor decided to take a little more time to crack down fearing livelihood loss,” said Narayan Jain, former president of Concern for Calcutta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/neighbourhood-still-under-water-blame-it-on-use-of-banned-single-use-plastic-bags/articleshow/86407396.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Coimbatore||Min: Govt working to bring industries to all parts of state||Coimbatore: Industries minister Thangam Thennarasu on Tuesday said the state government was working for the uniform growth of industries and would take efforts to develop the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in the district. He was in the city to attend a conclave that was organized by Tamil Nadu Industrial Investment Corporation Limited (TIIC) and the district chapter of the Confederation of Indian Industry. Thennarasu said industries were presently interested in setting up units in and around Chennai. “We want to change that and bring industries to all parts of the state. The government is also taking efforts to encourage and support MSMEs in the state.” The minister met industrialists in the district and sought to know their requirements and demands from the state government. M V Ramesh Babu, president, Coimbatore District Small Industries Association, said the defence ministry was willing to set up a state-of-the-art testing infrastructure for the defence sector in the district. “We have requested the minister to provide 25% of the financial assistance from the state government to set up the same, the project cost of which is pegged at Rs400 crore.” Upon the commission of the centre, he said, the defence component manufacturers in the district wouldn’t be required to send their components for testing to Nasik or Pune. “We have asked him to kickstart container manufacturing in the state as that will help meet the shortage of containers for export companies,” Ramesh Babu said. The industrialists have also asked the minister to include the district in the bilateral air space agreement to enable easy access to foreign airlines and speed up the land acquisition for the airport expansion. They urged the minister to promote the use of foundry sand, which now remains unused, for road construction and making solid block and pavers, as the same was non-hazardous. Since meeting the growing housing demand for guest workers has become a challenging task, it was suggested at the conclave to create employee townships under the public-private partnership mode as a satellite city to improve their standard of living.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/min-govt-working-to-bring-industries-to-all-parts-of-state/articleshow/86409727.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

In a letter to the CM, Venkatesan said that the affected projects include the 160km Madurai – Tuticorin line and 102km Vanchi Maniyachi – Nagercoil section. The other projects are the formation treatment of the 11.5km Virudhunagar – Vanchi Maniyachi section, the 23km Peralam – Karaikal new line, gauge conversion of the 37km Thiruthuraipundi – Agasthiyampalli, embankment flattening work in the 9km Nagapattinam – Velankanni section and gauge conversion of the rest of the 90.4km Madurai – Bodinayakanur stretch and Pattukottai goods platform works. “These projects are held up due to delay in granting permission for soil quarrying by district collectors of Tuticorin, Kanyakumari, Tirunelveli, Virudhunagar, Madurai, Theni, Thanjavur, Nagapattinam and Tiruvarur,” he said and attributed the bottlenecks created by the previous AIADMK regime. It is understood that the Madurai bench of the Madras high court had directed district collectors to ascertain the composition of minerals in the soil by sending the soil to a lab determined by the respective department. “So far, such labs have not been determined,” he said. Further, according to the collectors, the Tamil Nadu government has to issue necessary direction on various directions of the court which has not yet been issued. “It is painful that the above projects which are vital to the development of Tamil Nadu are lingering for want of a decision by the Tamil Nadu government including the determination of the lab,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/mp-tells-cm-to-allow-soil-quarrying-for-ongoing-rly-projects/articleshow/86409763.cms||---

The couple's four-year-old son Neel, who was on the bed, survived. The incident took place around 4.30pm on Tuesday when 38-year-old Raja Das, a car driver by his profession, got electrocuted after he touched the electric switch board to plug in his cell phone charger in the waterlogged room on the ground floor of a government housing complex at Khardah's Patulia near Rahara.

---||Chandigarh||Haryana ministers received SUVs during lockdown||CHANDIGARH: The Haryana ministers have made the most of the lockdown period. When the offices were closed and the movement restricted, SUVs and Mercedes E200 were bought for chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, his cabinet colleagues, and the leader of the opposition. All this came to light in Bhiwani resident Brij Pal Singh Parmar’s RTI (Right to Information) investigation into the government’s expenditure on refuelling the cars allotted to the CM, deputy CM, ministers, ministers of state, and the LoP. Parmar said: “If the government had closed down everything for four months of the lockdown this year, where was the need to travel? Why so much expenditure on cars when people were dying for want of medicines and oxygen? The government released not even a penny to schools under the Right to Education Act in this period.” Parmar had sought details of thes expenses between January and July. The cars allotted to minister of state (Mos) Om Parkash Yadav covered the maximum distrance, which was 1,16,456 kilometres and guzzled fuel worth Rs 11,56,360. Deputy speaker Ranbir Gangwa logged 1,07,988 kilometes with fuel worth Rs 10,99,656, to stand second. Next to them were Ranjeet Singh Chautala (91,952 km) Mool Chand Sharma (88,090 km) Anoop Dhanak (83,624 km) Kamlesh Dhanda (80,950 km), while the other cars travelled less than 70,000 km.

---||Mangaluru||Resume KSRTC bus services to Talapady for students: Forum||Mangaluru: With educational institutions in Dakshina Kannada commencing offline classes for grades six to 10 and PU, city buses between Talapady and Mangaluru witness a huge rush during peak hours. Following this, Sahayathri, a forum of daily commuters from Kasaragod have appealed to the Karnataka chief minister and the Dakshina Kannada district administration to resume KSRTC bus services between the Kerala border in Talapady and Mangaluru. Sahayathri member Kishor Yenankudlu told TOI that government buses from Kerala have been operating between Kasaragod and Talapady, but KSRTC bus services from Mangaluru division are yet to commence. “Due to lack of sufficient number of buses, students from Kasaragod are made to travel in packed city buses from Talapady to Manglauru. At least for the convenience of students from border areas, KSRTC should operate buses between Talapady and Mangaluru,” he said. Before the pandemic, KSRTC buses from Karnataka and Kerala were operating between Mangaluru and Kasaragod at three-minute intervals. After the first lockdown, bus services on the route were suspended. Later, in June and July this year, KSRTC buses from Mangaluru depot were operating between Mangaluru and Talapady. However, since Covid-19 cases increased in Kerala, the services on the stretch were suspended again and only city buses are operating between Mangaluru and Talapady. Students and daily commuters from Kerala are now allowed with RT-PCR negative reports, and they should repeat the tests once in seven days. To a tweet made by Sahayathri, the @KSRTC_Journeys (Karnataka SRTC) has replied: “Your complaint has been registered and has been sent to the department concerned.” When contacted, DK deputy commissioner Dr KV Rajendra, said it is not possible to commence bus services between Mangaluru and Kasaragod now considering the Covid-19 spike in Kerala. “We cannot allow KSRTC buses on Mangaluru - Kasaragod route until the positivity rate in Kerala reduces considerably. However, we will think about providing bus services between Talapady and Mangaluru only for students during peak hours,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/resume-ksrtc-bus-services-to-talapady-for-students-forum/articleshow/86406995.cms||---

For this reason, political parties want to have a majority in the Senate. The current executive of PUTA, backed by the Goyal group, may be in the electoral fray again. At the same time, BJP is looking for a common face. The PUTA president plays an important role in the Senate as all issues of teachers are taken up through him. There are four other Senate members besides. PUTA elections will be held in the first and second week of October. Sources said that apart from the sitting president and secretary in the electoral fray from the Congress-backed Goel Group, his entire team may contest the election again, particularly as the team got bumper votes in the last elections. There are speculations of PUTA secretary Prof Amarjit Singh Naura being made candidate for the post of president. Vice-president Dr Supinder Kaur is also a likely candidate but no formal announcement has been made. At the same time, BJP group does not have a candidate this time. Sources said that BJP would field a candidate in alliance with three to four small groups of PU.

---||Kolkata||Families struggle with household chores as helps go on rain leave||Kolkata: Large-scale inundation left most of the city households without helps — domestic helps, drivers, ayas, baby-sitters and gardeners — on Monday and Tuesday, triggering a crisis. Most of these helps, who come from the suburbs, found it difficult to negotiate the knee-deep water in their home, on their way to the railway station and flooded roads in the city to access the households. The sudden crisis has sent householders into a tizzy. Suddenly, they found themselves in the thick of unapprehended chaos. “Both my domestic help and driver skipped duty. I understand their problem. But it left me in major trouble. Fortunately, my husband opted for work-from-home and I rushed to my office late by public transport,” said Sarmistha Mujherjee, a private bank employee. It is even worse for the Mitra family of Dum Dum. Septuagenarian Gopa Mitra had a trying time with her ailing husband, who needs constant nursing care. “The aya just did not turn up. I promised her to pay extra, if she needed to bear extra cost for transport, but she could not do anything. The problem is she is unsure when she can join as her home is under waist-deep water,” she said. Domestic helps, drivers, caretakers and care-givers mostly come to the city from Lakshmikantapur, Canning and Diamond Harbour in the south and Barasat and Barrackpore in the north. The trains from 5am to 8am are called ‘Help Specials’. Conservative estimate says the number of helps come to the city from south alone is not less than 20,000 a day, it is a little less from the north. Anusuya Mazumdar of Griha Kalyan Helps Centre said: “We have 130 empanelled helps with us. Yesterday and today, I have had a trying time in handling a deluge of queries over the absence of helps. Most of the domestic helps work under a no-work-no-pay regime, yet the householders expect them to join work, be it rain or sun.” Motilal Gupta Road resident Shyamali Gupta, an advocate, faced a major challenge for the last two days. “Being a working mother, I am completely dependent on my help to look after my child. Since she did not turn up, I had to skip the court though I have a series of important cases to attend.” Aruna Haldar, a domestic help who resides at Jheel side, 4km from Dhopdhopi station, found it impossible to attend work. “My home is inundated. How can I go to Jadavpur, leaving behind my child in such distress,” she said. Kamala Sikdar, who comes to Garia by train from Sashan station, found the house she was supposed to work for completely inaccessible because of waist-deep water on the road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/families-struggle-with-household-chores-as-helps-go-on-rain-leave/articleshow/86407419.cms||Monotosh Chakraborty

---||Nagpur||No place for excuses any more, new guidelines will save millions of lives: Neira||Nagpur: On the day the world got new air quality guidelines from the World Health Organization (WHO), Dr Maria Neira, director of the department of environment, climate change and health at WHO, speaks exclusively with TOI on what the revised guidelines mean for a highly polluted country like India and much more. Excerpts: Q. How important is it for severely polluted and developing countries like India to adhere to the revised guidelines, especially when rapid urbanization and development is at its peak? A. We are aware that many developing countries like India are undergoing rapid urbanization. But this can’t be an excuse to shirk away from the responsibility of curbing air pollution and global warming. The new guidelines are based on strong scientific evidence and include recommendations not just to improve air quality but also on interventions that will be most useful. There is no reason why we cannot change the model of urbanization. It can be done strategically by recognizing major sources of air pollution, implementing a sustainable public transport system, switching to cleaner energy sources. This will be healthy not just for the environment but also for the country’s economy. Q. What made WHO revise the air quality safe limits, especially after a long gap of 15 years? A. Well, considering the accumulated scientific evidence, we decided it was time to review the standards and come up with new recommendations and best practices. We have been constantly reviewing evidence that shows how air pollution affects different aspects of health. Q. Were the previous guidelines of WHO sincerely followed by the world? How seriously should these standards be taken? A. It is true that the previous guidelines were not followed consistently by all nations. They have been implemented differently depending on the regions around the world. But what is clear is that, unfortunately, we still have a dramatic figure of around 7 million deaths every year due to air pollution. This clearly means we have a lot to do to save lives. Q. What is your message for the governments? A. This is an opportunity for politicians and governments to envision and raise ambitions, for showing citizens how ambitious they are to save their people’s lives. There is no place for any more excuses because we have plenty of scientific evidence. We are now facing terrible environmental disasters, confronting climate crisis like never before, and we know that if we tackle the causes of air pollution, then we will have benefits as well, on not just public health but also reducing climate change, improving economy as well as agriculture. Q. Which are the most vulnerable regions when it comes to toxic air? Are all countries as much in need of the new guidelines? A. While the most affected regions due to air pollution are South East Asia, Africa, West Pacific and Latin American countries, the new guidelines are addressed to every nation around the world. It is time for every country, whether developed or developing, to take true responsibility on curbing air pollution. They have to do it for protecting people’s health and to fight the terrible crisis of climate change. New guidelines do not have any legal mandate to enforce but we really hope countries will be able to recognize how many lives can be saved if you implement these recommendations. Citizens also need to contribute by putting pressure on their governments to accelerate action to fight air pollution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-place-for-excuses-any-more-new-guidelines-will-save-millions-of-lives-neira/articleshow/86427899.cms||Manka Behl

Transport minister Antony Raju has proposed the idea of starting “fish on wheels” using KSRTC buses. The minister said that a set of buses will be used for selling fish in the state. Apart from this, there are also plans to provide space inside KSRTC bus stands to sell fishes. Earlier, the decision of using the KSRTC buses for waste disposal had invited the wrath of employees and unions. Reacting to the criticism from employees, the minister said, “The proposal never meant that employees should engage in waste disposal. They only have to drive the vehicle.” The idea is to utilise the services of old buses for waste disposal, he added. However, the proposal of starting Bevco units in KSRTC bus stands received flak from various quarters. Later, the excise minister came out with a statement that there was no such proposal before the government to open outlets at bus stands. These proposals were mooted as part of increasing the revenue of the sick KSRTC unit. The unfit and old buses, which are now dumped in the garages of KSRTC depots, were proposed to be used for these services.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/now-transport-min-moots-fish-on-wheels-for-ksrtc/articleshow/86409803.cms||---

Chandernagore Police managed to nab two from Chinsurah within hours. A third one has been detained. A Kolkata Police detective department team led by an ACP is in Hooghly to question the accused as their “modus operandi is similar” to the ones used last week at Jorasanko and Bowbazar and they look “similar to the men wanted in Kolkata”. Sources claimed the accused could have their roots in either Bihar or Jharkhand. According to Chandernagore Police, the accused targeted the Laxmiganj Bazar branch located on GT Road on a day the rest of the market is usually shut. “They tied up one security staffer. One of the employees managed to use the alarm to alert the police. It was then that the accused started firing at the security,” claimed a witness. Police said the firing injured at least two employees of the firm. Seconds into the firing, a huge police force reached the spot but the accused fired at the cops too. Even as police opened retaliatory fire, the accused fled using the rooftop. Police immediately sealed the entire stretch between Chinsurah and Uttarpara and as many as 45 nakas were activated. The cops even stopped ferry services from Uttarpara to Mogra. They got the results within a couple of hours when they nabbed two of the accused. Chandernagore commissioner Arnab Ghosh said : “The bank authority lodged a complaint where they alleged that four miscreants entered the bank and looted Rs 1.5 lakh in cash. They also snatched a gold chain from an employee. We had set up 45 nakas three months ago and on Tuesday they helped us to arrest the accused quickly.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kol-style-gold-firm-loot-bid-in-hooghly/articleshow/86407443.cms||Falguni Banerjee

---||Mumbai||Terror plot accused was tasked by handler to recruit youths: Maharashtra ATS||MUMBAI: The Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS), probing a criminal conspiracy to commit a terror act case, said on Tuesday that the arrested accused, Zakir Shaikh, was tasked by his foreign handler, Anthony, to recruit youths to carry out terror activities. Anthony had used a Malaysian SIM card to communicate with Shaikh. However, it’s still not clear which country he was calling from, said sources. It has also transpired that the Mumbai crime branch had arrested Shaikh, an autorickshaw driver from Jogeshwari and an alleged aide of Dawood Ibrahim’s brother Anees, in 2016 for allegedly making extortion calls to a city-based businessman. On September 17, the ATS registered an FIR under the UAPA’s Section 18 for criminal conspiracy to commit a terrorist act against Shaikh and Anthony. A day later, the ATS arrested Shaikh (52). Later, a tuition teacher, Rizwan Momin (40), was arrested. “We got information about Shaikh and learnt that he was in touch with someone abroad,” said an ATS source. Shaikh was to catch a train to Luckn-ow on September 18, but the ATS picked him up before he could reach the st-ation. “Anthony had given an assignment to Shaikh to recruit youths for executing the task. During interrogation, some names of youths have emerged. We are verifying their details and calling people for questioning accordingly,” said the officer. Apparently, Shaikh suspected the police were tracking him, so he gave his phone to Rizwan to destroy it. Rizwan broke the phone into three pieces and threw it in a drain in Mumbra. “We have recovered the phone and sent it for forensic analysis ...We may get some clue about any app(s) which Shaikh could have used to communicate with his handler,” said the source. Shaikh, a class IX dropout, began working as a truck driver and went to Chennai. In 2001, the crime branch arrested Shaikh and six others on charges of plotting to assassinate BJP leader L K Advani and carry out blasts at the behest of the Chhota Shakeel gang. Shaikh’s elder brother Sagir, shown as the mastermind, fled abroad. “All the accused were granted bail in 2008. The case is pending,” said the officer. Earlier, it was reported that Shaikh was acquitted but it was not correct, he added. After getting bail, Shaikh got a new licence and became a taxi driver. At the time of arrest last week, he ran an autorickshaw. He has a 12-year-old da-ughter and two sons, aged 10 and five. The ATS is also trying to find out the connection between Shaikh and Dharavi resident Jaan Mohammed Shaikh alias Sameer Kaliya (47), who was arrested, along with five others, by Delhi police on charges of planning terror attacks across the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-terror-plot-accused-was-tasked-by-handler-to-recruit-youths-ats/articleshow/86411850.cms||Mateen Hafeez

He will be handed over to Goa police on Wednesday. Three of his friends managed to escape. Police said Mohammed Nowfal, 22, of Ernakulam in Kerala, and three of his friends rented a car in Goa for five days from September 18 by submitting fake Aadhaar cards. They told the rental company that they were visiting Pune and would return to Goa on September 19. However, when the company staff tracked the car using a GPS device attached to it, they located the car in Karnataka. Efforts of the company to contact the youths did not yield any result. Immediately, a staff member in the company informed his relative Ajithkumar, of Kerala, about the incident and shared the live location of the car. Ajithkumar tracked the car’s route. “The car was stopped near Coimbatore railway junction for an hour,” he said. Subsequently, he approached the city police. When the police tried to nab the youths, they managed to escape in the car. Police, along with Ajithkumar, followed the car. Ajithkumar contacted the company staff and asked them to switch off the engine using the GPS device. When the car engine was switched off near Suguna Kalyanamandapam, the youths tried to run away. Police, however, were able to catch Nowfal, while others escaped. The Peelamedu police seized the car. Ajithkumar said the car’s original number plate was changed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/man-who-stole-car-from-goa-nabbed/articleshow/86409792.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Many top hospitals in Madurai are seeing much lesser turnout thanks to improved vaccination coverage in urban localities, better availability of vaccine and the special camps. “Now many are coming in to get their second dose at our hospital. However, the number of those getting the first dose has seen a slight decline. Compared to the peak period in June, lesser people are coming in,” said Rohini Sridhar, chief operating officer, Apollo Hospitals. In Madurai district, 10 private hospitals are authorized to provide Covid-19 vaccination At Meenakshi Mission Hospital and Research Centre (MMHRC), officials said currently around 20-30 people get the jab a day. “Covishield is still the most sought after. People who don’t mind paying are still coming forward for vaccinating in private hospitals. We will continue to procure vaccines as per need,” said J Adel, General Manager – Operations, MMHRC. Private hospitals allow both booked appointments as well as walk-ins though the former has many takers. “There are people who prefer private hospitals for the safe, comfortable and reassuring environment. However, one issue with low number of appointments is that when a vial is opened, we have to administer 10 doses. So, we have had to combine sessions,” said a senior official at Devadoss Hospitals. Only around 10-20 beneficiaries a day are getting vaccinated at the hospital on average. Though private hospitals are the only ones to supply Sputnik V vaccine, both the hospitals administering the vaccine in Madurai — Vadamalayan Hospitals and MMHRC — have stopped providing first doses. “We had good response for the first batch. However, later we found that many got themselves vaccinated at other hospitals for the second dose. This left behind stock. With less demand now, we decided not to procure additional stock as the vaccine expires in 2-3 months,” said an official at Vadamalayan Hospitals. At MMHRC, due to poor demand, additional stock of vaccine was not procured.  One dose of Sputnik V Vaccine costs Rs 1,145, whereas Covishield costs Rs 780 and Covaxin Rs 1,410 in private hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/crowds-thin-for-jabs-in-private-hospitals/articleshow/86409848.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

It is only fair that a person who has indulged in illegal mining for a considerable period before being caught, should be made to pay, including for the harm done to the environment and ecology as a consequence of the illegal activities, the court added. The court passed the order on a PIL moved by C Prabhu seeking direction to the state government to take immediate steps to stop illegal quarrying across the state. When the plea came up for hearing, the state submitted a status report through the principal secretary in the industries department. According to the report, all illegal mining activities have been stopped, criminal complaints lodged against the relevant persons and further steps are contemplated to recover damages. Responding to the report, the petitioner submitted that the impact to the environment as a consequence of the illegal mining activities undertaken by several persons in the locality has not been attempted to be assessed. He further alleged that the colossal biodegradation that was caused as a result of the illegal mining activities has neither been studied nor any person held accountable. Advocate-general R Shunmugasundaram submitted that in addition to criminal complaints, primarily under Section 379 of IPC, being filed, steps are being taken against those involved with illegal mining to recover the money made by them in their illegal operations and also appropriately penalise them. Recording the submissions, the court said, “the state’s plan of action against the relevant entities should be charted out and placed before this court when the matter appears a week hence.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/hc-to-tn-dont-just-stop-make-illegal-miners-pay-up-for-damage/articleshow/86409827.cms||---

---||Madurai||More students keen to go abroad for higher studies||Madurai: If the pandemic and consequent restrictions on international travel dealt a severe blow to students set to go overseas for higher studies in 2020, the situation has greatly improved this year. There is also no hesitancy among students and families in travelling abroad, say overseas educational consultants. “South Tamil Nadu always sees a steady stream of students who are willing to go abroad for higher studies. Last year, they couldn’t travel to campuses and so were not keen since the programmes were also offered online. Foreign education is about the experience abroad after all. So, many students had deferred it by a year and are keen to pursue it now instead,” said Pramod Joseph, Krishna Consultants Overseas Education, Madurai. He added that many international universities offered incentives like lower fees and waivers for IELTS and SAT exams, which was also encouraging for students. The United States (US), United Kingdom (UK) and Canada are among top destinations for studying abroad this year, especially as post-study work visas allowing students to work for two-three years are available. “Students have already started travelling to countries like US, UK and Canada where borders are open. For Dubai as well, there is some interest. However, Australia and New Zealand, which are often among preferred destinations for studies, are yet to open their borders,” said Aladi Arun, AK Consultants, Madurai. Financial constraints and restrictions on travel are the major factors influencing students’ willingness to travel abroad. “I will be going to the UK for a master’s degree in international relations at a reputed university. I had actually got admission last year but couldn’t take it up then and decided to defer for a year. Financially as well, it was tough last year. Since things are a bit more settled this year, I’m able to go now,” said RS Jyoti, a 23-year-old graduate. Expenses for studying abroad have seen a drastic increase this year. “Students have had to spend around 4-5 lakh rupees more than usual. It is a struggle for loans as well since they don’t cover costs of quarantine programme or flight tickets. Air travel in particularly has seen a drastic increase. But, there are students willing to spend as it has become difficult to get good jobs here,” said Keerthi Vash, propreiter, Flyhigh Overseas, Madurai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/more-students-keen-to-go-abroad-for-higher-studies/articleshow/86409829.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

The committee, headed by the civil aviation secretary, also comprises the director general of civil aviation (DGCA) and top officials of Airports Authority of India, AAIB and other agencies as members. The committee was asked to look into safety recommendations proposed by AAIB to be implemented by various stakeholders including AIE, AAI, DGCA etc. AAIB’s probe report, which identified pilot error as the likely cause of the mishap, had given hopes that DGCA might lift the ban on wide-bodied aircraft. The probe report hadn’t made adverse references about the tabletop runway of Karipur airport or operation of wide-bodied aircraft citing runway safety concerns. DGCA had barred operation of wide-bodied aircraft in May 2015 on runway safety concerns and permission was reinstated in 2018 after AAI undertook mitigation measures along with safety assessments by airlines. After AIE crash, operation of jumbo flights was suspended in Aug 2020. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/new-panel-report-to-decide-future-of-jumbo-flights-from-karipur/articleshow/86409860.cms||---

If our students only run in the direction to attain jobs in the corporate or IT sectors, who will create jobs for the country?” Sisodia added.“Do we want our kids to just become a small part of a corporate company or should we prepare them to take risks like an entrepreneur and become change-makers in the society?” Sisodia said dreams of even children studying in the best institutions were limited to working as an employee in big firms abroad. Sisodia also said there was a need to think about the shortcomings that had hampered the growth of India’s export sector. “Delhi government is committed to provide all support needed by our fellow business community in realising and giving wings to their export dream.” If laws are made on the assumption that traders are working to steal, it will only lead to a negative mindset for businessmen, he added.“Delhi’s potential is evident from the export business turnover of up to $10 billion,” industries minister Satyendar Jain said. But Delhi alone can’t suddenly create the space needed for export business, Jain said, urging all governments to remove restrictions on export industries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/push-exports-prepare-students-to-be-job-providers-says-sisodia/articleshow/86407502.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Durga Puja is less than a month away but work in Kumartuli has been stalled on several occasions in the past fortnight due to frequent spells of torrential rain. This period is said to be crucial as artists give form to the idols with mud on wooden framework, for which dry and sunny weather is a must. About 6,000 Durga Pujas are organised in Kolkata and its suburbs, of which most of the idols are made in Kumartuli. In a year full of financial distress, rain has lifted production cost by almost 15% to 20%. Kartik Pal, secretary of Kumartuli Mritshilpi Sanskritik Samity, explained how the rain is threatening to derail their recovery. “Before the pandemic the business in Kumartuli from Ganesh Chaturthi to Kali Puja would be anywhere between Rs 50 crore to Rs 60 crore. But after the pandemic, lockdown and second wave, the organisers do not have enough funds and thus the earnings have come down to Rs 25-30 crore. This year is slightly better than the previous one, but rain is disrupting the entire schedule,” said Pal. Cost is also increasing as artists are being forced to procure diesel, ovens, pedestal fans, huge plastic sheets and factor in damages to raw materials due to the rains. “Since the weather is not dry and sunny, artists are forced to use fire and fans to dry various parts of the idol. They are procuring diesel and hiring ovens and fans which is adding to the cost,” added Pal. Many artists are using the tarpaulin sheets provided by local MLA Shashi Panja. The materials required to curate the idols — mud, dry hay and pieces of wood — are also getting damaged in the rain as they are kept outside their workshops. “We need dry hay (khar) to make the wooden frames for the idol. But both were damaged by the rain,” said Ganesh Pal, another artist. Many artisans have also complained of damage to their studios. “The roof of my workshop is leaking due to which I am unable to work properly. I have reduced the number of orders,” said artist Prodyut Pal. Till a few years ago, organisers would take the delivery even on Tritiya or Chaturthi. Now they want idols before Mahalaya as most pandals are thrown open to visitors by then. “We can’t miss deadline, so we are working 14 to 16 hours a day,” said artist Ganesh Pal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/late-sept-rain-pushes-up-production-cost-as-kumartuli-artisans-grapple-to-meet-deadline/articleshow/86407532.cms||Zeeshan Javed

---||Delhi||Fund allocation: Depts to submit revised expenses||New Delhi: Delhi government’s finance department has initiated the process of preparing revised estimates for 2021-22 and budget estimates for 2022-23. All departments have been asked to submit the estimates and also make a realistic assessment of funds required during the current financial year so there is no overestimation.The departments have also been asked to ensure that the entire projected funds are utilised. This is because it was noticed in the past that re-appropriation of funds was made by some departments, but they were unable to utilise even their original budget estimates.Revised estimates are mid-year review of projected receipts and expenditure, which also includes expenses on new services. It is based on the actual trend of receipts and expenditure of six months. The preparation doesn’t authorise any expenditure and also doesn’t supersede the budget estimate.An official said the departments would be formulating the estimates broadly under establishment and other committed expenditure, government schemes and projects, and centrally sponsored schemes. Unrealistic assessment of funds is not conducive to a proper budgeting system and invites adverse comments during audit.“Utmost care should be taken to avoid discrepancies. In the past, there have been instances where some departments made supplementary demands for grants for certain schemes or sub-schemes, but the actual expenditure incurred was less than the original budget estimate at the end of the financial year,” added the official.Based on the revised estimates, supplementary demands for grants would be made and the assembly’s approval sought.Departmental meetings have started to prepare the revised estimates and directions have been issued to officials concerned to submit the proposals.Due to the pandemic, the expenditure of some departments, like health, increased because of hospital management, drugs procurement, etc. In April, when the capital witnessed the deadly second Covid-19 wave, the government had to spend a lot on management of the disease. The social welfare and revenue departments also provided relief to dependents of those who died due to Covid-19 as well as orphaned children. Such departments may demand extra funds in the revised estimates.Recently, deputy CM Manish Sisodia said Delhi government had received 23% less revenue this year, even though moderate budget estimates had been kept due to Covid-19. Delhi government received 41% less revenue in the financial year 2020-21 due to the lockdowns. “In the current financial year, GST collection has decreased by 23%, VAT by 25%, excise by 30%, stamp duty by 16% and motor vehicle tax by 19%,” he added.“The government is withholding most of the expenses for now, except salaries and Covid-related expenses. We are trying to cut down on expenses, wherever possible,” added Sisodia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/fund-allocation-depts-to-submit-revised-expenses/articleshow/86407524.cms||AlokKNMishra

He was being treated for Covid and his last rituals were completed at the electric crematorium in the afternoon adhering to Covid protocols. Parameswaran Namboothiri, disciple of Chembai Vaidyanatha Bhagavathar has been credited with the conduct of two major classical music festivals in Thrissur district. He started the Chembai Sangeetholsavam in Guruvayoor when the great maestro was alive and ensured that it continued to grow even after Chembai’s death. Later, he started the Thiruvambady Sangeetholsavam as part of temple festivities and popularized it by bringing well-known musicians from the world of Carnatic music to perform here. His life and times were made known to the general public through his disciples who made a documentary film ‘Abhivadaye’ through the World Music Foundation on July 24, 2021. “As his disciples, we are glad that we could show him the documentary and receive his blessings. But somehow, the feeling that we could have done more remains,” said Gireesan Bhattathippad, director of the documentary. TOI carried an interview on July 31 with the artist after the release of the documentary. He recalled his days with Chembai and early years spent in the company of several great musicians in both Madras and Kerala. “Just a few weeks ago, we honoured all those who helped make the documentary and it was our guru who gave away the small mementoes,” said Sunoj Poongad, his disciple who initiated the idea of a documentary on the maestro. The maestro is survived by son Babu Parameswaran, a musician in the US, and daughter Parvathi (assistant professor, VTB college, Sreekrishnapuram, Palakkad).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/mridangam-maestro-namboothiri-dies-at-91/articleshow/86409922.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Besides this, the profile shall help in monitoring of research work from time to time. These are the recent directions from the institute to give fillip to its research. The Google scholar profile will be linked to the research account of all faculty members. For the departments, PGI administration has directed creation of a department-wise scholar account. “This is to have a system in place where if anyone objects during the research award, there is a document to endorse the same,” said a senior faculty. The dean, research office, PGI has cleared all the pending approvals for grants. Sources inform that the highest number of research projects are by Prof Neelam Taneja, department of microbiology, Prof Shivaprakash, department of microbiology and Prof Sanjay Bhadada, department of endocrinology. “But more such researchers must be enrolled online to share their work and have an updated list of their work,” said a faculty. There are more than 550 faculty in the PGI and currently most of them upload their research work on different sites. In the latest NIRF ranking, the PGI maintained its second slot after AIIMS under the medical category. The AIIMS scored 97 in the research parameter while the PGI had 86 score under the parameter. The patents filed were 7 and 3 were granted. This has improved over the years. “But this is too low as compared to the other research institutes. PGI also stood second in its publications during the Covid pandemic after AIIIMS. But there has to be emphasis on research quality as well,” said a faculty in PGI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pgi-faculty-to-upload-research-on-google-scholar/articleshow/86407593.cms||Shimona Kanwar

His wife has alleged that he was fed up with the delay in getting relief after repeatedly visiting government offices. The body of Ram Sagar (55), a native of Pachkhura village in Ghatampur area of the district, was found hanging inside his flooded house by his family members on Wednesday morning. He used to live with wife Rajeshwari and sons Amar and Abhay and daughter-in-law. One of his daughters, Tulsa Devi is married. The village was waterlogged due to incessant rains in the last week of July. “Ram Sagar’s house was also flooded with water. Though the level of water receded, the house of Ram Sagar remained inundated in water. He had built a temporary make-shift structure using a tarpaulin in front of a neighbouring house,” informed family members while talking to reporters. Rajeshwari said in the last one and a half months, her husband had made several rounds to various government offices but failed to get even the interim relief given to flood victims due to official apathy. “The authorities at SDM office told him that the lekhpal would come and conduct an spot inspection, but till date neither the lekhpal nor any officer reached nor any inspection conducted,” Rajeshwari alleged and added, “Due to this Ram Sagar went into acute depression and on Tuesday night, he hanged himself in one of the rooms of the same flooded house.” “After my sons witnessed the body of my husband hanging, they raised an alarm and alerted neighbours, who informed the police. After this the body was removed and sent for post-mortem,” she said. Local MLA Upendra Paswan said he will talk to the concerned authorities in this regard. “The reason for delay in disbursal of compensation will be ascertained. All possible help will be provided to the victim’s family,” said the MLA talking to the reporters. “We will probe as to how Ramsagar’s family was not included in the beneficiary list,” said SDM Ghatampur Arun Kumar Srivastava.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/man-fails-to-get-aid-hangs-himself-in-his-flooded-house-in-ghatampur/articleshow/86436711.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

Scores of cars had to be towed to workshops. While some cars suffered engine seizure after the engine rocker arm or connecting rods were damaged, others encountered short circuit in alternator and self start mechanism, seizure of the AC compressor and snag in power steering controller. More expensive cars fitted with multiple sensors and controllers under the bonnet took a bad hit. “We have had multiple distress calls from motorists in Behala and Rajarhat New Town apart from Rabindra Sadan, Minto Park, Woodburn Park, Loudon Street, Short Street, Camac Street, Park Circus, Deshapriya Park and Southern Avenue. We got some towed to the garage, but some are still stranded on the road,” said Sandeep Banerjee, who manages a workshop on Hazra Road. While those with controller damage may claim insurance, cars that have suffered engine seizure and damage to rocker arm, may have claims turned down. “It is best to avoid waterlogged streets. If more than half the wheel gets inundated, one should ensure that the exhaust pipe does not get immersed in water. If that happens, there are chances of water gushing into the engine,” warned Banerjee. “Repeated attempts to start engine can damage rocker arm. In that case, cost of repair will shoot up to Rs 80,000-90,000. Insurance cover, too, cannot be claimed. So, we advise people to push car out of the water, wait for water to drain and then attempt to start. If the engine does not crank, then call service centre. Damage caused by water ingestion into the engine is covered by insurance,” said Kanak Saha, service manager at an auto dealership workshop. “I had gone to Sector V to drop my wife home when my car got stuck and refused to start. Thankfully, a group of young boys agreed to push my car out of water for Rs 500, after which I called the service centre who towed the car away. I know it’s going to cost me a lot,” said Soumya Mukherjee, who drives a sedan. Bikes too suffered seizure of engine and clutch damage. Behala resident Krishnendu Maiti’s bike engine gave away in a waterlogged stretch near Taratala. “The clutch plate and engine piston head require replacement. It would cost around Rs 3,000,” said motorcycle distributor Sharad Gupta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rush-at-city-garages-as-cars-bikes-break-down-on-waterlogged-streets/articleshow/86407661.cms||Subhro Niyogi

The results were announced a few hours after the examination that was conducted on Monday. The pass percentage was 85 last year. Of the 2,859 candidates, including 49 students from abroad, who appeared for the test across 52 disciplines on Monday, 2,570 had cleared the same. There were 50 questions carrying one mark each and the students who scored a minimum of 15 marks were declared pass. There was no negative mark. The highest number of 435 candidates were from English literature discipline and 408 of them cleared the test. Students from commerce, management and mathematics disciplines too showed more intertest in appearing for the test, compared to other disciplines. Pointing out that there were highly-paid opportunities for English language teachers abroad, BU vice-chancellor P Kaliraj attributed that as a reason for more students opting for English. He said more students had appeared for the test this year compared to last year, as Covid cases had come down. The university departments, affiliated colleges and recognized research centres of BU offer full-time and part-time MPhil and PhD programmes. The common eligibility test is a must for admission to the research programmes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/90-clear-test-for-bu-phd-mphil-admission/articleshow/86409947.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The civic chief said that the assessment has been undertaken to ascertain all damaged roads where liability period prevails, which will entail the concerned contractor to undertake repairs. “Once we identify the roads, we will ask the contractor to repair them and if the latter is not forthcoming, NMC will impose fines on such erring contractors,” said Jadhav, adding that NMC will undertake repairs of roads where the liability period is over. Jadhav said that he has instructed the concerned officers to ensure that the assessment work is completed within a week so that the repairs can start thereafter. “NMC will ensure that the repairs are carried out fast,” he added. The poor condition of many city roads was discussed during the general body meeting of the civic body that took place on Monday. City mayor Satish Kulkarni has pointed out to the civic administration that the poor condition of roads, coupled with digging of roads can lead to mishaps. “I have told the administration that it should give priority to road repairs as it is causing a huge inconvenience to road users, especially motorists,” added the mayor. There are many busy thoroughfares in the city that are riddled by potholes, making driving a dangerous proposition for motorists. When it rains, the potholes are filled with water and many times motorists find it difficult to navigate around potholes. The NMC commissioner said that the work to refill the dug-up area of the roads will start from Monday. Some of the roads in the city were dug up to lay underground gas pipelines by Maharashtra Natural Gas Ltd (MNGL).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-starts-assessing-rain-damaged-roads/articleshow/86403408.cms||---

The team found that he was involved in several financial transactions with the other accused in the case. CB will seek the custody of Deepesh, who is in judicial custody, after collecting more details about his involvement. Excise officers said transactions worth Rs 32 lakhs happened through his bank accounts and most of the money was sent to the five accused who were arrested earlier. He was arraigned as an accused under various sections of the NDPS Act. “We suspect that he had a key role in the smuggling network and was one of the funders. He is a close friend of the key accused and had given money several times knowing that it would be used for drug purchase and smuggling. He earned a lot of money as commission. We are questioning more persons and more arrests will be made in coming days,” said a senior officer of the team. On Sept 14, CB arrested Shifan Taj (23) of Amballoor on charges of making financial transactions with the accused. Excise will seek his custody too. But, the suppliers of MDMA in Chennai are yet to be traced. Though their phone numbers were traced, the SIMs were purchased using fake ID cards. Meanwhile, forest team probing the seizure of a deer antler from the accused, recorded the arrest of five persons, who are in judicial custody at Kakkanad jail. Kodanad forest range officer recorded the arrest of Sreemon, Shamna and Mohammed Fabas of Kozhikode, Ajmal of Kasaragod, and Mohammed Afsal of Ernakulam in the case registered under Wildlife Protection Act.

---||Mumbai||Element of inducement, key to cheating, missing in Raj Kundra case: Court||MUMBAI: Going by the statements of witnesses, the element of inducement, which is a prime ingredient of cheating, appears to be missing from the prosecution’s case, a magistrate’s court said while granting bail to businessman Raj Kundra on Monday in the pornography case. Kundra and Ryan Thorpe, the IT head of his company, who were both arrested on July 19, walked out of Arthur Road jail on Tuesday afternoon after the formalities. The detailed four-page order was made available on Tuesday. Additional chief metropolitan magistrate S B Bhajipale noted that all servers, laptops and mobile phones of the accused were in custody of the police and, hence, there was no possibility of tampering with evidence. “At present, all the accused are released on bail. In such circumstances, only on the grounds that further investigation is going on, the accused cannot be kept behind bars till conclusion of trial,” he added. The prosecution had opposed the bail pleas of Kundra and Thorpe. ‘Probe over, trial to take time, can’t keep Kundra in custody’Granting bail to businessman Raj Kundra, a magistrate’s court said the trial is likely to take its own time. “In such circumstances, it will not be proper to keep the accused in custody when they are ready to furnish surety for their appearance and to abide by conditions set by the court,” it added. The court said 64 witnesses have been cited by the prosecution and the chargesheet runs into 4,000-plus pages. Moreover, none of the offences attract a sentence of more than seven years’ imprisonment. “The report of the cyber expert is still awaited. At present, investigation is completed as the chargesheet was filed on September 15,” said the court, pointing out the SC has held that the accused cannot be kept behind bars even for an inconsiderable period when investigations are completed. Advocates Swapnil Ambure and Prashant Patil had argued that Kundra and his associate Ryan Thorpe were not related to uploading of the allegedly questionable content. “There is not a single allegation in the supplementary chargesheet against the applicant (Kundra) that he was actively involved in any video shooting. In fact, it is the sole discretion of the individual artistes to upload content on the app,” the bail plea said. The defence said the case of the prosecution is not that there are victims who were coerced or threatened by Kundra. “None of the artistes ever raised any grievance or any alarm with regards to the socalled alleged filming and broadcasting of erotic content. By their own admission, their dispute is in respect of sharing of financial gains and consequential contractual obligation,” the bail plea had said. The court noted there is a statement in the chargesheet about transactions. “However, from the statement, it can only be gathered that transactions took place between Kenrin and Hotshots and out of said transactions, there was an exchange of amounts. However, exchange of amounts is not an offence levelled against the accused in the chargesheet,” said the court. The chargesheet said Kundra had set up Hotshots, an online platform, with the intention of distributing pornographic material. Victims were cheated by being told that they were going to be given roles in web series, short films and television serials. A forensic audit also revealed money laundering of the Hotspots revenues. The funds were diverted using Google and Apple apps to UK company Kenrin’s account in Lloyds Bank even before the app’s sale by Armsprime Media Pvt Ltd. Police suspect Kundra has a stake in the production company Kenrin and was involved in production and distribution of pornography material. Kundra and Thorpe have been told not to leave the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-probe-over-trial-to-take-time-cant-keep-kundra-in-custody/articleshow/86412008.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Nagpur||SECR rocked by dalit widow’s sexual harassment charges against two sr officials||Nagpur: South East Central Railway (SECR), Nagpur division, was rocked by fresh allegations of sexual harassment and casteism, levelled by a dalit widow against two senior officials of commercial department. The officials have refuted the charge, labelling them baseless and false. In the past, a senior divisional commercial manager had been booked for molestation following a complaint from a woman staffer. He was also booked under the Prevention of Atrocities Act. In the latest case, the woman claimed in her statement to senior police officials that she was repeatedly harassed over work and summoned to the cabin by the officials on some or the other pretext. The widow also said the officials often touched her hands and also hair. The widow also said the officials abused her verbally and insulted her by referring to her caste. The woman is now hospitalized, after furnishing a statement before the assistant commissioner of police Trupti Jadhav. Around a week ago, the woman had also handed over her complaint to general manager of SECR during his visit to Nagpur. Later, it’s learnt that she had also submitted a complaint before the Divisional Railway Manager (DRM), SECR, narrating her plight, before meeting CP Amitesh Kumar last week. The woman revealed in her statement before police that she wanted to end her life too due to the incessant harassment. She had lost her husband in 2016 and had been under treatment for neurological issues in last few years. Sources said the two officials from the commercial department were summoned by zonal DCP Vinita S and asked to furnish their statement before ACP Jadhav. CP Kumar said the police department has sought details from the concerned railway department regarding the findings of the Vishakha committee set up for addressing grievances related to sexual harassment at the work place. “We are not keen to jump to any conclusions but trying to collect all relevant details before taking any decision,” he said. DRM, SECR, Maninder Uppal said his department is fully cooperating with the probe agency and the matter is under investigation. Officials from SECR’s commercial department said on condition of anonymity that the widow was pulled up number of times by seniors for under-performance. “There is no question of any harassment or abuse of any kind with the concerned employee and also anyone else. We had merely tried to get her to do the job expected from her, and her responsibilities were even reduced to help her cope with ailments,” said a senior official. In yet another uncomfortable development for SECR commercial department, there have been a flurry of tweets regarding corruption by some officials here. Even the prime minister and railway minister’s offices too were tagged in the tweets targeting officials, said sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/secr-rocked-by-dalit-widows-sexual-harassment-charges-against-two-sr-officials/articleshow/86409954.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Kochi||Kottayam rubber prices resisted fall: ANRPC||Kochi: While the natural rubber (NR) farmers always complained about the local rubber prices, this time the domestic market had been strong, notes the report from a global agency . “In sharp contrast to all the other NR markets, the RSS4 market in Kottayam (India) resisted the price fall during the first half of September. This is despite a reported improvement in the domestic production of NR in the country during the first half of September helped by improving weather conditions and lifting of the pandemic-related restrictions in the state of Kerala. RSS4 prices in Kottayam fell only by 0.3% during the first half of Sep (compared to the second half of Aug) as against 4% to 6% fall observed in other markets,” said the latest report from the Association of Natural Rubber Producing Countries (ANRPC). “The first half of September has seen NR prices taking wide swings with the notable exception of Kottayam market in India. Within just 10 trading days, the prices tumbled by 4% to 6% and immediately returned to the previous level. Strikingly, the downswing as well as the recovery have not been caused by any development specific to the rubber industry,” ANRPC report noted. “The period under review has unfolded the dominant influence on the NR prices by the factors which are external to the rubber sector. Although such factors apparently look external to the rubber sector, some of the factors hold a strong bearing in setting the demand outlook for NR. The pace of global economic recovery, developments in the auto sector, and crude oil trends are important factors from this perspective,” the report added. According to ANRPC, the global supply of NR is expected to improve in the short term. “The month of October usually produces more NR compared to the immediate previous months helped by favourable seasonal factors prevailing in major producing countries. Moreover, the supply constraints caused by Covid-19 have eased across producing countries as most of the governments have lifted the restriction to help the economy move ahead,” the report said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/kottayam-rubber-prices-resisted-fall-anrpc/articleshow/86410029.cms||Shenoy Karun
---||Hubballi||Citizens urge authorities to intensify search for leopard||Hubballi: Citizens and elected representatives vented ire against the district administration for not trapping the leopard that was sighted on the premises of Kendriya Vidyalaya No. 1. They said if the forest officials failed in catching the leopard, they would launch an operation by citizens to trace the big cat. Taking part in the public meeting organised as a measure of confidence building among people at the KV, corporator Veeranna Shalavadi said that administration had taken it seriously only after sighting the leopard at KV premises. “Staff engaged in search operation are not given any modern weapons. Nrupatunga Betta is not a big forest but just an area of 50 acres with bushes. The administration should call experts from Mysuru and Chamaraj Nagar districts to trap the leopard at the earliest. It looks like forest officials are thinking of pushing the leopard to other areas but it’s a not permanent solution” he added. At this point, he lost his temper and said that people have already reached the height of patience and if they plunge onto the streets, things will go out of control.Siddu Mogalishettar, a regular morning walker at the Betta, alleged that search operation has been intensified only from Monday. “Many senior citizens and women have fallen ill due to the fear of the leopard and many more are suffering mental trauma,” he said. Another citizen Vishwanath complained that no patrolling is being done in the populated areas around Nrupatunga Betta. “If the district administration is running short of earth-movers for combing operations, we are ready to get them from contractors,” he said.Sunil Nittur, a resident of Shiradi Nagar pointed that the district administration has suspended offline classes of KV alone and not other schools. “The cages, set by the forest officials, are filled with lizards and how can you expect the arrival of leopard there? If this is the pace of the operation, it will not be concluded even after months. Given an opportunity, we will dare trap the leopard and the forest personnel can follow us,” he challenged.Responding to public worries, deputy commissioner Nitesh Patil said that the leopard will be trapped in 2-3 days. “We have learnt that a scrapped building on the KV premises may turn a safe heaven for leopard or any animal. So, we have ordered immediate demolition of the same. More forest personnel will be brought from neighbouring districts. Experts have already joined in the operation. We have taken feedback and suggestions from residents and elected representatives. Forest officials are camping 24x7 at the KV till the leopard is captured,” he added.Manjunath Chavan, chief conservator of forests, Dharwad Circle, Yashpal Kshirasagar, deputy conservator of forests, HDMC commissioner Suresh Itnal, DCP Ramarajan K and other officials were present in the meeting.BoxThough there was no permission from KV Commissioner in Delhi, Dharwad district administration started the demolition of abandoned building located at KV No.1 premises in Raj Nagar on Tuesday evening. DC Nitesh Patil said that considering the situation and in the safety interest of KV students and public of the area, the building is being demilished. “Meanwhile we have also suspended offline classes of 12 schools of surrounding areas util the leopard is trapped. We have instructed these schools to continue with online classes” he added.Eom/21.9.21/by Sangamesh||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/citizens-urge-authorities-to-intensify-search-for-leopard/articleshow/86405503.cms||---

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Storm water flows back from choked canal, floods New Town, Salt Lake||KOLKATA: After rain ceased on Tuesday morning, water began to recede from various inundated areas in Kolkata. But the reverse happened in New Town and pockets of Salt Lake with water level continuing to rise even long after it had stopped raining. The chocked Bagjola canal meant that water that was pumped into it flowed back into the township. The rising water level inundated water tanks in residential complexes, raising fear of water contamination. NKDA had to rush water tankers to several neighbourhoods. Most homes purchased drinking water from the market. The water level in Bagjola canal that is usually at the 1.8-metre level has increased to 3.18 metres, triggering the crisis. In the past, the maximum level that the water has risen to is 2.5 metres. Sukhobrishti, the largest housing complex in New Town, is under knee-deep water. “The situation is absolutely terrible. Water has seeped into elevator ducts. There are families with dialysis patients who have had to wade through the water to go to the hospital. Since we depend on delivery boys, who are now refusing to come, many people are simply stranded,” said Sukhobristi housing complex cultural secretary Mainak Kanrar. At Maple Hiland Woods, the situation is no different. “Residents are unable to move out. We tried to pump out the water from the complex basement but were unable to do so because the road in front is inundated,” said resident Kunal Dhar Sharma. The plight of residents was similar in several complexes and cooperative apartments in New Town Action Area 1A, 1B and 1C. Even residents who had been staying in the showpiece township for a decade now said they had never witnessed a situation such as this. Prolonged power cuts added to the residents’ woes, particularly in high-rises where lifts did not function. The power utility switched off supply to prevent electrocution. In complexes that did not have power backup, pumps could not be operated leading to water crisis in bathrooms. “We have not had power for 24 hours. My cellphone battery had drained. I drove around in the car while recharging the phone,” said Samir Gupta, a resident of New Town CE Block who is also the secretary of New Town Citizens Welfare Fraternity. Kaustav De, a resident of BA block, wondered how New Town claimed to be a smart township when basic drainage infrastructure was inefective. “Water has not receded even 12 hours after rain has stopped. Many had to purchase drinking water from outside,” he said. “We arranged for about 150 number of 20-litre mineral water jars which residents across several localities bought by paying as there was no electricity in their complex,” said Samaresh Das, chairperson of New Town Forum and News (NTFN), an umbrella organization of residents forum in New Town. “We are issuing advisory to all to fully pump out stored water from underground reservoirs where the filthy water has entered. A doctors’ team has also been kept ready. We will give water purifiers for free from our medical centres,” said an NKDA official. In Salt Lake, block localities like HB, IA, FD, GD, AE and BF were still under ankle-deep water on Tuesday morning. Workers of Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation also cleaned chocked drainage lines. BMC board of administrators chairperson Krishna Chakraborty said a survey will be conducted to find out which places have been witnessing most waterlogging this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/storm-water-flows-back-from-choked-canal-floods-new-town-salt-lake/articleshow/86407713.cms||Suman Chakraborti

Chief executive officer Rahul Gajbhiye said the road repair work has been taken up mainly in the Lam Road area and other roads from Thursday. He said that the aim is to get the roads repaired permanently with proper asphalting rather than filling the potholes with murrum. Lam Road connects Deolali Camp with Nashik Road and the rest of Nashik city. As a result, there is a huge flow of vehicular traffic on this road. The potholes on this road have caused frustration among the daily travellers. In the past, there have been serious accidents due to the potholes and patches on the road have also caved in. Taking note of the same, the authorities are ensuring that the road is not only repaired by filling murum and other material in the damaged section but also with the use of tar, so that the road is strengthened, said senior officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/deolali-cantt-board-begins-fixing-road/articleshow/86403446.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The Covid therapies including the vaccines are expected to be rolled out in India next year, and could be manufactured at the Serum Institute, sources told TOI. Since these therapies are under development or under trials, final agreements are yet to be inked. “AstraZeneca is working with governments around the world to make AZD7442 (cocktail of monoclonal antibodies) accessible to high-risk populations as another valuable option in the fight to end Covid, should it prove to be effective and well tolerated. Additionally, the new Covid-19 variant vaccine AZD2816 is under trial and once initial data becomes available, will be submitted to regulators for assessment as a next-generation booster vaccine and through an expedited regulatory pathway,” AstraZeneca India MD Gagandeep Singh told TOI. The next generation vaccine is under trials in the UK and Brazil. The company has accelerated efforts to advance the development of the antibody cocktail — long-acting antibody combination — for potential prevention and treatment of Covid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/astrazeneca-to-roll-out-in-india-multiple-covid-therapies-in-2022/articleshow/86414366.cms||Rupali Mukherjee

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Showers open up craters, damage road patchwork||KOLKATA: The rain that have opened fresh craters on some roads and washed away the patchwork on others may push back the Kolkata Municipal Corporation’s pre-Mahalaya October 2 deadline to complete all post-monsoon road repairs. Police in desperation on Tuesday arranged for rubbish, mostly construction debris, to fill up the big craters that have appeared on Diamond Harbour Road and Taratala Road. KMC said it needed 10 days without rain to complete the road repairs and kept its units on stand-by hoping for the weather to clear up. There is barely two weeks left for Mahalaya. Police had earlier prepared a list of 318 roads which required immediate repairs. On Tuesday, this had 77 new additions. In CR Avenue, for example, large stretches of the five kilometre-long road have developed craters which need to be repaired immediately for safety of motorists and commuters. These are worse in Ram Mandir, Jorasanko and Medical College areas. Similarly, major roads like Narkeldanga Main Road, APC Roy Road, AJC Bose Road, Bidhan Sarani, Mahatma Gandhi Road, Asutosh Mukherjee Road, Shyamaprasad Mukherjee Road, NSC Bose Road (Tollygunge) and Subodh Mullick Road now have many potholes. Worse, patchwork repairs done in some of these stretches have been washed away. KMC Board of Administrators (BoA) chairman Firhad Hakim also expressed concern over the rains delaying the repair process of the city’s roads before the Pujas. Hakim said, “The civic teams are all on stand-by and will wrap up the repair work once they get a dry spell. Enough damages have already been done; we hope for a dry spell to quickly wrap up the road repairs.” The potholed roads and craters are turning out to be a motorists’ nightmare. “Even on Tuesday morning, Sahapur Road, Burdwan Road, Raja Santosh Roy Road and Remount Road Crossing remained waterlogged. There was excessive traffic on DH Road with no other alternative road to divert Behala-bound vehicles.  Add to it the office-time vehicles towards Sector V and Rash Behari crossing which came on DH Road as they could not turn towards New Alipore-Chetla due to waterlogging,” said a Kolkata traffic police officer.

The Sanganmer police said the driver, identified as Subhash Telore, is a resident of Pathardi in Ahmednagar district. Police said Telore left a note behind, telling his family members to take care of each other and return the money he had borrowed to pay for household expenses. How much money he owed was not mentioned in his note. Telore is survived by two sons, aged 23 and 21 years. The Sangamner police, who have registered a case of accidental death, said Telore’s body was found hanging from the hand-bar inside the bus. He had used a rope to make the noose. The police said Telore was on a bus headed from Pathardi to Nashik. On Monday night, the bus ran out of fuel. The passengers were accommodated on another bus and Telore was told to fill fuel at the Sangamner bus depot. Telore and the bus conductor stayed overnight in the bus at the Sangamner depot. At 5.30 am on Tuesday, Telore asked the conductor to go and freshen up. However, when the conductor returned, he found Telore hanging from the bar inside the bus. The police were immediately informed. The Sangamner police conducted the panchanama and removed the body. Nandu Kankate, the workers’ union leader of the Sangamner bus depot, said that as per his knowledge, Telore had loans of at least Rs 6 lakh. Low salary and erratic payment may have pushed Telore over the edge, he said. “The salary payments have been erratic. As it is, the salaries of the MSRTC workers are extremely low when compared to other government departments — though they are considered essential workers. And then, the payments are not made on time. Last month, the salaries of two months were cleared. No one knows when the next salary will be paid. The worker’s medical bills generated during the Covid period too are yet to be cleared.” “Telore may have been fed up with his financial situation, which may have forced him to take the extreme step,” said Kankate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/msrtc-driver-ends-life-inside-bus-at-sangamner-depot/articleshow/86403491.cms||Santosh Sonawane

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Locals raise banners for ROB in place of flooded Khar subway||MUMBAI: Fed up with the condition of Khar subway, many people living in the vicinity have started placing banners outside their buildings with messages like ‘Why nobody wants to improve Khar subway?’, ‘We want a permanent solution to Khar subway’ and ‘We have been complaining, but no results’. Locals said a road over-bridge (ROB) was needed, given the dilapidated condition of the subway, which floods during the monsoon, after which it develops potholes, followed by traffic congestion on roads leading to the Khar subway. TimesViewSurely, residents of the area deserve a better deal. For years they have suffered traffic jams because of the subway. Public works and area planning must reflect the will of the people, and if a flyover is the answer, then one should be built. Experts must be consulted to sort out this problem once and for all.Trivankumar S Karnani, a lawyer who runs the twitter handle @MNCDFbombay (Mumbai North Central District Forum), put out a series of tweets demanding a flyover connecting west and east over the old and dilapidated Khar subway. In a tweet, Karnani said: “Residents residing around Khar Subway on the West or East side who are frustrated with the lack of political will and inaction of the administration, government and representatives, please DM us our team will visit & install a banner in your premises !” Amit Nanda from the Santacruz East Residents Association (SERA) said the banners had been placed right from 1st road up to 7th road in the locality. “Considering that all letters to the authorities have been answered so far, we have to take this step. Each time the authorities take up a patch of road for improvement. However, the entire space needs upgradation,” Nanda said. Nitin Thakkar from SERA said the subway was a crucial east-west crossing and while the population around the area had increased owing to redevelopment of many old buildings, especially in Khar (west), the authorities were not considering any upgradation of infrastructure. “Almost every locality from Goregaon to Ghatkopar today has an ROB over the railway crossing, so we do not see why Khar should be left out,” Thakkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/locals-raise-banners-for-rob-in-place-of-flooded-khar-subway-in-mumbai/articleshow/86412094.cms||Richa Pinto

The police will soon take the survivor’s statement under CrPC section 164 in presence of a magistrate. The accused duo — CA Ashok Jain and Raju Bhatt, an investor in his firm — are, however, absconding. A senior police official said that cops are trying to track down the two accused who were not found in their residences. “The girl has alleged that she was thrashed by the accused and also threatened with dire consequences if she revealed about her rape to anyone. She belongs to Haryana and was in the city to pursue law studies at a private university,” the official added. The survivor had joined Jain’s firm about five months ago on a paid internship. “She had to travel a long distance to the firm and so, Jain helped her get a flat on rent in Diwalipura area,” an official said. The complainant alleged that Jain took her to a guest house on Vasna Road a month ago and introduced her to Bhatt who is an investor in his firm. In her complaint filed against the duo late on Sunday night, the survivor said that Jain, who is in his 60s, spiked her drink and molested her at the guest house. He then went to her flat later and allegedly raped her. After some days Bhatt, who is also a trustee of a temple, went to the complainant’s flat and demanded physical relation. When she refused, Bhatt threatened her with dire consequences and then allegedly raped her. The police said that the accused sent her nude photos to her male friend and threatened to upload her pictures on social media too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/i-was-assaulted-threatened-to-stay-silent-about-my-rape/articleshow/86405129.cms||---

The Gondal youth received a call from someone who introduced himself to be the megastar and also sounded like him informing him about the huge prize money he ‘won’ in a popular TV reality contest. Victim Shrawan Singh Rawat, who used to work in a cotton mill, said he received the calls between December 25 and 28 last year telling him that he won Rs 25 lakh in the millionaire contest of the megastar’s popular television show. Police said that Rawat got lured hearing the prize money and did not pause to doubt about the authenticity of the caller. Rawat said he received four calls in as many days and that he had little doubt about the caller not being the superstar himself. He agreed to do as was told and Rawat transferred Rs 1.1 lakh in different amounts through UPI applications to claim the prize money. But after he was asked to shell out more, Rawat became suspicious and stopped sending money and approached the police with a complaint, based on which an offence was registered at Paddhari police station. “We had received a complaint last year, but the complainant had left for his native place in Rajasthan and so, we could not take his detailed statement. Recently, when we learnt that he had returned to Gondal, we called him and after preliminary investigation, we registered an FIR,” said sub-inspector R J Gohil of Paddhari police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/21-year-old-mill-worker-falls-for-amitabh-bachchan-con/articleshow/86405720.cms||---
---||Delhi||Kyrgyz woman, son found dead in Delhi's Kalkaji||NEW DELHI: A 28-year-old Kyrgyz woman, who was five months pregnant, and her 13-month-old son were found dead inside her friend’s flat in southeast Delhi’s Kalkaji on Tuesday morning. The woman, Myskal Zhumabaeva, had reached out to her friend following a fight with her husband on Monday night. She wanted to visit a hospital due to pain in her abdomen. A case of murder has been registered. DCP (Southeast) RP Meena said, “We received a call in the morning from Vinay, the woman’s husband of two years, saying his wife and son Manas had been killed by her friend at her house in Kalkaji. He claimed his friend’s wife, Matluba Madusmonova, an Uzbekistan national, called in the morning to inform him that his wife and son were no more.” Cops found the two bodies lying on the bed. There were stab wounds on the bodies and a kitchen knife was recovered from the room. Senior officers as well as the crime and forensic teams also visited the spot. An initial probe revealed that on Monday night Vinay and Zhumabaeva got into an argument over going to the hospital. Vinay left her at his house in GK-II and went to meet his friend, Wahid, who lives in South Extension. “Zhumabaeva called Madusmonova for help and was taken to a hospital by her and her friend Avinish. They then returned to Madusmonova’s house and were found dead in the morning,” said Meena. Madusmonova and her friend Shaina had been living in the Kalkaji flat for the past two months. Avinish, Madusmonova’s alleged boyfriend, was also present in the house. “Madusmonova said Avinish and Shaina were with her in the living room. When they woke up in the morning, they saw the mother and son dead on the bed with stab wounds. She then called Vinay. All of them are currently being interrogated to ascertain the sequence of events,” police said. Senior police officers stated that the woman spoke to her husband on Friday night and told him that she had gone to the hospital. “So far what we have come to fore is that her husband was at his friend’s house and he was seen nowhere near the scene of crime, so it’s unlikely that he is involved. There were three people present in the house: the friend of the deceased, her male friend and flatmate. As per the CCTV no outsider has been seen entering the house. As of now the prime suspects are Matluba,her male friend and Matluba’s flatmate. Cops also suspect that it could be that the woman might have killed her baby and then allegedly killed herself. However this is only the parallel line of investigations,” an investigating official added. Locals claimed they had not seen Zhumabaeva in the area much, but it appears there was some fight on Monday at Madusmonova’s residence. When TOI reached the location on Tuesday, it found that the locals were not aware of the murder until the morning. A neighbour said, “We did not hear anything. The woman who passed away was not seen here much. The two other women resided together. Some people claimed that they heard noises at night, allegedly of a fight, but others got to know about the murder only in the morning when police came to the building. They had recently moved into the flat on the second floor.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/kyrgyz-woman-son-found-dead-in-delhis-kalkaji/articleshow/86414350.cms||---
---||Goa||Devendra Fadnavis holds one-on-one meets with BJP MLAs, ministers: Goa assembly elections||PANAJI: Goa BJP election in-charge Devendra Fadnavis held one-on-one meetings with BJP MLAs and ministers on Tuesday to gauge the political situation and chalk out a final strategy for the state assembly elections early next year. He said all sitting MLAs would remain in BJP. The former Maharashtra chief minister was in Goa on a two-day visit. Canacona MLA Isidore Fernandes told Fadnavis that each of the 10 former Congress MLAs who switched to BJP should be given tickets. He said party functionaries who had lost the elections and who had betrayed BJP were claiming for tickets. “What right do they have to stake such a claim? We have come to BJP without condition,” he said. Panaji MLA Atanasio Monserrate guaranteed Fadnavis that he would win all five seats in the Tiswadi taluka for the party. He said that during former CM Manohar Parrikar’s time, BJP used to win only a single seat in the taluka, while the remaining four used to be claimed by Congress. Monserrate, however, said that he did not mean that Parrikar was unable to win all five seats for the party. “But, if Parrikar was alive, I wouldn’t have been able to win the Panaji seat. Parrikar always came first,” he said. Mayem MLA Pravin Zantye told Fadnavis that mining should restart before elections so that people can get jobs. “The mining belt will stand with BJP,” he assured. PWD minister and former MGP MLA Deepak Pauskar said that when he and tourism minister Manohar Ajgaonkar had joined BJP, Union home minister Amit Shah had promised them tickets to contest the 2022 assembly elections. Fadnavis also met power minister Nilesh Cabral, Aldona MLA Glenn Ticlo and Mandrem MLA Dayanand Sopte.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/fadnavis-holds-one-on-one-meets-with-bjp-mlas-mantris/articleshow/86410238.cms||---

---||Goa||Sawant copying Delhi govt’s ideas, says Kejriwal||Panaji: Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday took potshots at his Goa counterpart, Pramod Sawant, calling him a “duplicate” and accusing him of copying schemes already implemented by the Delhi government. Addressing party workers and supporters, he said, “If the original model is coming to Goa, why should one vote for the duplicate?” “I heard that Sawant-saab has announced free water supply for Goa,” he said. “We implemented this model in Delhi four years ago. We guaranteed free electricity in Goa, they have announced free water in Goa. The doorstep delivery announced here now is what we have implemented in Delhi for some time now. It is good. But the Delhi model is being copied, and if Goans can vote for and choose the original, why should one go for the duplicate?” Kejriwal and Sawant have previously squabbled on Twitter over issues like the power tariff. On Tuesday, Kejriwal also hit out at Congress, and said that the government has been alternating between the two parties who are looting the state by turns. “We have made an elaborate plan for Goa with Goa’s people, as per their requirements,” he said. “Goa is a beautiful state with beautiful people. But the politicians have left no stone unturned in looting Goa. Each waits for the other’s term to end, so they get an opportunity to loot. We have to stop this loot.” Kejriwal said that Congress is nowhere in the running at the upcoming 2022 Goa assembly polls. “We are growing gradually. Some have released pre-polls surveys. At the moment, BJP is at number one and AAP is at number two, and Congress seems to be collapsing. There are still five months left for the polls. I am sure in five months, Goans will bring AAP to the number one position.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sawant-copying-delhi-govts-ideas-says-kejriwal/articleshow/86410370.cms||---
