---||Allahabad||When Mahant Narendra Giri forgave disciple after bitter fallout||PRAYAGRAJ: Mahant Narendra Giri, 62, was elected as president of Akhil Bhartiya Akhara Parishad (ABAP) in 2014 and re-elected to the all-important post on October 10, 2019, at a meeting held at Haridwar. ABAP is the apex decision body of the 13 recognised Hindu religious monastic orders of the country. The serving secretary of the Shri Panchayati Akhara Niranjani, Narendra Giri, hailed from trans-Ganga area of Prayagraj. Having close proximity with both Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) and Samajwadi Party (SP), Narendra Giri had a fallout with his disciple and noted Yog guru and the then “Chote Mahant” of Bade Hanuman Temple Swami Anand Giri in May this year. Following this, Anand Giri was expelled from Baghambari Math and Niranjani Akhara as well. Anand Giri had been accused of continuing to have connections with his family in violation of the set norms of conduct for sanyasis. He was also accused of indulging in financial irregularities associated with the temple fund, a fact that was confirmed by the secretary of the akhara, Shri Mahant Swami Ravindra Puri. Anand Giri had also reached the PMO and UP CM with his complaint against his guru. The action against Anand Giri had followed a complaint against him in this regard by Narendra Giri. However, within a few days, Anand Giri had formally sought forgiveness from Narendra Giri and the Panch Parmeshwar of the Shri Panchayati Akhara Niranjani. Narendra Giri had then forgiven him and also lifted the ban on Anand Giri from entering Bade Hanuman temple and the Baghambari Mutt that had been imposed on him at the time of expulsion. Anand Giri was taken into custody from Haridwar on Monday after his name surfaced in the suicide note of his guru.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/how-narendra-giris-differences-with-his-disciple-were-resolved/articleshow/86378490.cms||Rajiv Mani

Those figures are up from the 385,586,012 vaccine doses the CDC said had gone into arms by Sept. 19. The agency said 212,035,328 people had received at least one dose, while 181,728,072 people are fully vaccinated, as of 6:00 a.m. ET on Monday. The CDC tally includes two-dose vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech , as well as Johnson & Johnson's one-shot vaccine. Over 2.2 million people received an additional dose of either Pfizer or Moderna's vaccine since Aug. 13, when the US authorized a third dose of the vaccines for people with compromised immune systems who are likely to have weaker protection from the two-dose regimens.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-administers-386-2-millin-doses-of-covid-19-vaccines-cdc/articleshow/86379026.cms||---

US secretary of defence Lloyd J Austin told defence minister Rajnath Singh, while briefing him on AUKUS in a telephonic conversation on Monday evening, that Washington will continue to cooperate closely with New Delhi in multilateral fora as before. “Singh, in turn, said India was studying the AUKUS agreement,” said a source. Austin’s call comes just ahead of PM Narendra Modi’s visit to Washington for the first in-person Quad summit of the leaders of the US, India, Australia and Japan on September 24. Singh also conveyed India’s deep concerns over the huge amounts of latest US weapons, ranging from Humvees and helicopters to drones, night-vision equipment and assault rifles, left behind in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. “Both the leaders discussed bilateral and regional matters including developments in Afghanistan. They discussed defence cooperation and looked forward to working closely,” said a defence ministry statement. “Singh and Austin also exchanged views about combating terrorism in the region. Both sides appreciated the mutual cooperation in the recent evacuation operations in Afghanistan and agreed to remain in regular contact in view of the evolving situation,” it added. On the Indo-Pacific, there are some concerns that AUKUS could dilute the strategic cooperation envisaged under the Quad, relegating the quadrilateral grouping to just issues like climate change, Covid-19 vaccines and the like. Under the AUKUS, Australia will get the wherewithal to build at least eight nuclear-powered attack submarines or SSNs (different from SSBNs, which are nuclear-propelled as well as armed with nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles) to counter China’s expanding naval footprint in the Indo-Pacific. Compared to India’s solitary SSBN INS Arihant as of now, China has at least six SSNs and an equal number of SSBNs, including the latest Jin-class submarines armed with 7,400-km range JL-2 ballistic missiles. The US, incidentally, has over the years has refused to discuss nuclear reactor propulsion technology for submarines or aircraft carriers with India. The much-touted Indo-US Defence Technology and Trade Initiative (DTTI) for collaboration on cutting-edge military technologies has also largely failed to deliver the goods since being launched in 2012.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/aukus-wont-impact-quad-us-tells-india/articleshow/86379086.cms||Rajat Pandit

---||India||Quad eyes synergies to beat influence of Chinese goods||NEW DELHI/WASHINGTON: The most important aspect of the in-person Quad summit scheduled for Friday is the very fact that it is bringing four leaders together in the middle of a pandemic, signalling the strategic imperative of the move. While it may not be named but the summit will showcase the group’s main intent — to balance China. US President Joe Biden will hold bilateral talks with PM Narendra Modi on the margins of the Quad meeting in Washington on Friday, the White House revealed on Monday. While Modi is scheduled to hold separate bilateral meetings with all the Quad leaders, Biden will also meet Japan’s PM Yoshihide Suga. The bilaterals are expected provide clarity, among other things, on the new AUKUS alliance involving Australia, UK, and US aimed ostensibly at countering China’s growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region. While AUKUS is largely a military alliance involving transfer of top-tier military technology, the Quad, which is also aimed at countering China, has a largely economic orientation. The Quad meeting is likely to intensify cooperation in areas first identified during the March virtual summit of the four leaders — vaccines, critical technologies and climate change. Sources said the Biden administration will try hard to put behind them the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal, and focus on the pivot to Asia. In the area of technologies, cybersecurity and trusted supply chains will be highlighted. US deputy NSA Anne Neuberger visited India for detailed discussions on cybersecurity and emerging technologies with Indian officials at UIDAI and private sector entities in Hyderabad and Bengaluru. The attempt is to harmonise standards and benchmarks in the first phase, but the goal is to cooperate in building production chains that bypass China. Japan and US will be critical here, specially in manufacturing, while India brings in software and design skills. Nikkei got a sneak peek into the joint statement to be issued at the end of the summit, which is expected to focus on creating trusted supply chains for semiconductors. It said the statement will confirm that “resilient, diverse and secure technology supply chains for hardware, software, and services” are vital to their shared national interests. Indian officials said semiconductors would be only one of the different aspects of critical technologies that will be discussed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/quad-eyes-synergies-to-beat-influence-of-chinese-goods/articleshow/86379910.cms||Indrani Bagchi

Though the MHA has so far not spelt out Sarma’s role, this is a fresh attempt to get Muivah on board through a political functionary (Sarma), who is the convenor of North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA), ahead of next year’s assembly election in Manipur where Nagas are the biggest block of voters in 20 of the 60 seats. Sarma, after a meeting with Union home minister Amit Shah in New Delhi, said he was going to Dimapur on Tuesday, “not as a chief minister, but as NEDA convener.” “I have been participating at some point in the talks between the Centre and NSCN (IM), though not officially, but mostly as NEDA convenor if have to discuss with the state’s political parties. I will be in Dimapur tomorrow also to discuss the political scenraio after the state became oppositionless with the NPF and an Indpendent joining the NDPP-BJP allinace,” Sarma said. Ahead of Sarma’s likely meeting, NSCN (IM) led by Muivah held its first formal meeting with the Centre’s representtaive, former IB special director AK Mishra, at Chumoukedima in Kohima on Monday and reiterated that there can be no solution without a separate flag and constitution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/himanta-to-help-centre-end-stalemate-in-naga-peace-talks/articleshow/86378221.cms||Prabin Kalita
---||Guwahati||Assam: Class X pupils return to school after 4 months||GUWAHATI: Cent per cent attendance was recorded in some of the schools here as physical classes for Class X resumed in Assam after a gap of more than four months on Monday. Despite high enthusiasm among students, the school authorities said the overall response was disappointing. Education department officials blamed laxity among a greater chunk of the students and fear of contracting the infection for the low turnout on the first day. Even as the flow of students in schools in some of the prime locations of the capital looked encouraging in the morning, the final turnout in Kamrup (Metro) district was disappointing. "Attendance was hardly 40% on an average in greater Guwahati. Most students are just not willing to come to school," said Kamrup (Metro) inspector of schools (IS), Prasanna Bora. Gobinda Kalita, a teacher of the New Guwahati Railway Colony High School, said cent per cent students were present though in the rural areas of Kamrup (Metro), a large number of students remained absent. “Lack of online gadgets, poor network and the cost of internet data usage drew a significant number of students to offline classes across Assam,” said Kalita, who is also the general secretary of the Asom Madhyamik Sikshak Aru Karmachari Sanstha. About 47% students on an average attended the schools in Lakhimpur district in upper Assam. Attendance was scanty in interior and riverine areas that were ravaged by the recent wave of floods. Education department officials in Lakhimpur, however, felt that there is less concern about the virus among the students. “A section of students who are meritorious and willing to learn have come to school. But another section was not so enthusiastic,” said Lakhimpur IS, Ramesh Chutia. Across districts, the response was positive mostly in the schools located in district headquarters and urban areas. Most students stayed at home in interior places where online classes faced big hurdles due to poor internet connectivity. Even as upper Assam districts like Sivasagar registered better turnout, sources in the education department said it was not beyond 60%. “Educational institutions are being opened phase wise. Since the government is keeping a watch on the Covid situation, some guardians are not willing to send their children to school now,” a senior official of the state secondary education department said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/class-x-pupils-return-to-school-after-4-mnths/articleshow/86376877.cms||Kangkan Kalita
---||Guwahati||Congress dumps Mahajot for now, to go it alone in bypolls||GUWAHATI: After months of speculation about which way the Congress would go for the upcoming byelections in the state, the Assam PCC announced on Monday that they would go solo in a bid to add more muscle to its grassroots base. Shepherding the Mahajot, an alliance of opposition parties, to take on the BJP has been put on hold. Six assembly seats are heading for byelections soon and of these the Majuli seat is yet to be vacated by its incumbent legislator, Sarbananda Sonowal, who was inducted in the Union cabinet recently. There is a whisper in the corridors of power that Sonowal may resign from the state assembly today. Assam PCC president Bhupen Borah, at a press meet here, said the Congress wants to go it alone in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls and 2026 assembly polls and does not want to weaken its organisational base further by giving space to allies. “We have given a clear message to the grassroots workers that we want to fight the coming Lok Sabha and assembly elections alone. That’s the reason why the Congress is going solo to strengthen its base by snapping ties,” said Borah. “Too much dependence on alliance partners has weakened the Congress in Assam. The prime example is the Bodo inhabited areas where we relied heavily on the Bodoland People's Front,” he added. Borah said they will have diverse strategies considering the current strength of the party. “In Majuli, the Congress lost by 48,000 votes in the last assembly election. Our strategy will be different here than in our strongholds Thowra and Mariani,” said Borah. He said in Mariani, Thowra, Bhabanipur and Gossaigaon, the party is ready to fight the byelection alone, though in Majuli and Tamulpur it can consider the candidature of other anti-BJP parties. Though he ruled out the possibility of an alliance with the Akhil Gogoi-led Raijor Dal, the state Congress chief said they are thinking of stitching an alliance with the Assam Jatiya Parishad. Even while the Congress was heading the Mahajot, it had been planning to take the AJP on board after the exit of AIUDF. “Congress has fixed September 27 as the last date for receiving applications from candidates. We will take the final decision about fielding candidates after assessing the strengths and capabilities of applicants,” he added. He said the party as of now has only 27 MLAs in Assam but the Congress has an ambition to return to power. “If we go for tie-ups, the grassroots workers would get demoralised. They would not work wholeheartedly, fearing the seats may go to the allies,” he said. Congress announced the Mahajot, an alliance of 10 parties, ahead of the 2021 assembly polls, but Assam PCC decided to dissolve the coalition recently on the grounds that it no longer serves the interests of the party. The most influential partner, AIUDF, was shown the door after it started singing a different tune in favour of CM Himanta Biswa Sarma. Their alleged ‘soft stance’ towards the Taliban in Afghanistan was also a cause of concern. Other alliance partners like CPI have announced a candidate for Thowra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/congress-dumps-mahajot-for-now-to-go-it-alone-in-bypolls/articleshow/86376903.cms||Kangkan Kalita
---||World||France seeks European support after submarine deal surprise||PARIS: France canceled meetings with British and Australian officials and is trying to rally EU allies behind its push for more European sovereignty after being humiliated by a major Pacific defense pact orchestrated by the US The US, Australia and Britain insisted Monday that the diplomatic crisis wouldn’t affect their longer-term relations with France, which is seething over a surprise, strategic submarine deal involving the three countries that sank a rival French submarine contract. France recalled its ambassadors to the US and Australia for the first time in history because of the deal, and its anger is showing few signs of subsiding. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, in New York to represent France at the U.N. General Assembly, is expected to give a news conference Monday to address the situation. He’s also meeting with foreign ministers from the other 26 European Union nations in New York, where he will discuss the consequences of the submarine deal and France’s vision for a more strategically independent Europe. France won support Monday from the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, who told CNN that “one of our member states has been treated in a way that is not acceptable. ... We want to know what happened and why.” While US President Joe Biden is hosting the Australian and British leaders this week, he won’t see French President Emmanuel Macron, who’s not traveling to the UN Instead, Biden plans a call with Macron in the coming days, where he will underscore the U.S. commitment to its alliance with France and lay out specific measures the two nations can take together in the Indo-Pacific, according to a senior U.S. administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss planning for the leaders’ call. The official said while the administration understands the French position on the issue, it did not “share their view in terms of how this all developed.” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said a disagreement about “a single decision” would not disrupt a relationship or harm the United States’ standing across Europe. The submarine deal, known as AUKUS, will see Australia cancel a contract to buy diesel-electric French submarines and instead acquire nuclear-powered vessels from the US. The US, Australia and Britain say the deal bolsters their commitment to the Indo-Pacific region, and has widely been seen as a move to counter an increasingly assertive China. The French government appears to have been blindsided by the agreement, and feels its own strategic interests in the Pacific — thanks to its territories and military presence there — were ignored by major allies. “It’s not just a Franco-Australian affair, but a rupture of trust in alliances,” the French foreign minister was quoted as saying in the French newspaper Ouest-France. “It calls for serious reflection about the very concept of what we do with alliances.” Le Drian said he canceled a meeting with his Australian counterpart in New York “for obvious reasons.” Le Drian said he has no meeting scheduled with his US counterpart, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, while he’s at the U.N., but might “pass him in the hallways.” Meanwhile France’s defense minister canceled a meeting with her British counterpart this week. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, meanwhile, insisted that Britain’s relationship with France is “ineradicable.” Speaking on his way to New York, he said, “AUKUS is not in any way meant to be zero-sum, it’s not meant to be exclusionary. It’s not something that anybody needs to worry about and particularly not our French friends.” British officials have stressed the close military ties between the U.K. and France, including joint operations in Mali and Estonia. In Australia, officials said France’s anger wouldn’t derail negotiations on an Australia-European Union free trade deal. French Ambassador to Australia Jean-Pierre Thebault denied media reports that France was lobbying the EU not to sign the trade deal with Australia that has been under negotiation since 2018. Australian Trade Minister Dan Tehan said he would travel to Paris within weeks for trade negotiations and was “very keen to touch base with my French counterpart.” “I see no reason why those discussions won’t continue,” Tehan said. The European Commission, the EU’s executive branch, said Monday they’re analyzing the impact of the Australian submarine agreement. Australia argues that the submarine deal was about protecting its strategic interests amid broad concern about China’s growing assertiveness.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/france-seeks-european-support-after-submarine-deal-surprise/articleshow/86380697.cms||---

A recent case of a woman facing jeers by a group of miscreants while on the Aravalli Leopard trail has highlighted the issue yet again Recently, a runner from Gurgaon took to social media to speak up about the harassment and abuse that his wife faced at the hands of miscreants while they were on an early morning run through the Aravalli Leopard trail. The social media post, widely shared in the Facebook groups of the Millennium City, talked about how a group of youth on bikes catcalled the woman and clicked her pictures without her consent. The woman, who spoke to us on the condition of anonymity, recounts, “It was a scary and infuriating experience. I was running a few paces behind my husband when these guys on their bikes began to pass filthy comments and began to click pictures. I yelled at them but as soon as I tried to click their picture, they sped away. By the time my husband came over, they were gone.” But this incident isn’t a one-off. Female runners from the city say that despite a huge running community in Gurgaon, harassment is far too common. Several areas in the Aravalli foothills, which have previously been a haven for runners, are also not safe anymore. Ananya, a runner who used to frequent the Aravalli trails, says, “Earlier, people didn’t know about the trails. They were offbeat spots so it was safe and quiet there. Most runners liked those trails because they are close to nature and hence, perfect for being away from the city’s hustle-bustle and traffic. But over the years, they have come to be frequented by bikers and several miscreants. After I faced harassment from them multiple times in a short span, I stopped going over to that side to run. It’s not worth the hassle and mental trauma.” ‘Runners have no option but change routes to avoid such incidents’To avoid such incidents now, female runners from Gurgaon say they choose their running routes carefully, avoiding deserted stretches and keeping their runs to well-lit areas around societies within the city. Sector 67 resident Anita Yadav says, “It may sound sad but after a while, you have to learn to ignore the comments and catcalls while running in Gurgaon because it is routine. Particularly on the Gurgaon-Faridabad Road and trails in Aravalli, it can get scary because there is nobody around. So, you try and keep your runs to well-lit areas within the city, just to be safe. In the city, since there are always societies and guards around, so things don’t escalate” Many others have changed their running schedule and tag along with larger groups to avoid any untoward incident. “For me, running used to be a therapeutic thing, my me-time. I would go on solo runs early in the morning because it used to be peaceful. But after a few untoward incidents, I realised it wasn’t safe and hence, decided to run with friends in large groups, preferably with male runners. My parents were so worried that they issued an ultimatum that they wouldn’t allow me to run if I went alone. After all, safety is paramount,” says a runner from Gurgaon, who did not wish to be named. ‘Comments are made to not only female runners, but also male runners accompanying them’Male runners, who accompany their female counterparts on these early morning runs, say that in places, residents have clashed with them rather aggressively. Varun, who has been a runner for close to five years, says, “Often times, the locals and bystanders tell us male runners to ‘mind our women’. I often go on runs with female friends and if you object to people passing cheap comments, I have been told to tell my friends to ‘cover up and run properly’ if they want to avoid that. If we try to argue that we are just wearing running gear, it can escalate into a full-blown argument. You try to avoid that if you have women with you.” Runners say that often, they face these untoward comments and behaviour that border on stalking within the city limits too. Aanchal Sehgal, an avid long-distance runner from the city, tells us, “On weekends, we tend to face such things more. That’s because our early morning run time coincides with partygoers returning home after a late-night bash. They are mostly drunk and almost always leer, pass comments, or even follow.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/catcalls-and-jeers-what-female-runners-go-through-on-their-morning-runs-in-gurgaon/articleshow/86371429.cms||Abhimanyu Mathur

---||India||Pandemic study reveals lack of trained health personnel||NEW DELHI: A pandemic-period study found that India's health system struggled with low numbers of trained health personnel, including nurses, trained paramedics and allied health workers with nurse-doctor ratio at a poor 1.7:1. A report by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI) underlines India's skewed skill-mix ratio in the health workforce with wide variations across states and the report estimating the overall nurse to doctor ratio at 1.7:1 and that of allied health workers to doctors at 1:1. These estimates further deteriorate if qualifications are considered and given weightage. The labour force based estimate (NSSO 2017–18) of doctors to nurse ratio is barely 1:1.3 after adjusting for adequate qualification. Compare this with most OECD countries, where there are 3-4 nurses per doctor. The Indian High Level Expert Group (HLEG) recommendation for the nurse-doctor ratio in India stood at 3:1. While some states have more doctors, others have more nurses. The nurse to doctor ratio ranges from Punjab (6.4:1) and Delhi (4.5:1) on the higher side and Bihar, Jammu and Kashmir and Madhya Pradesh having less than one nurse per doctor. Even in Kerala, where the number of nurses is very high, the worker nurse to doctor ratio was less than 1:1. Worker nurses are basically nurses who are both registered and active. Similarly, for allied health workers there are large variations across states ranging from more than five allied personnel per allopathic doctor in Himachal Pradesh to as low as one-tenth (0.1) allied health professionals per doctor in Bihar. “In addition to increased availability of and accessibility to quality health workers by population in general, enhanced investment in human resources for health will lead to strengthening of the health system for dealing with pandemic situations like Covid-19 and any other epidemic/s,” the report titled ‘Health Workforce in India-Why, Where and How to Invest’ said. Times ViewPlenty of attention is paid to the shortage of doctors in the country. The need for allied health workers, equally crucial for proper delivery of healthcare, doesn’t get the same focus. It is about time authorities start working in this direction to overcome the deficiency, both in quality and quantity. At a time when joblessness abounds, this sub-section of the healthcare sector can also be a major job generator.A few states such as Delhi, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh have a high nurse-doctor ratio but in here the density of doctor per 10,000 persons is extremely low. According to the 15th Finance Commission, a nurse-to-population ratio is 1:670 in India, against the WHO norm of 1:300. The report has used data from the National Health Workforce Account (NHWA) on the stock of health professionals who are registered and Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) conducted by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO 2017–18) that depicts active health workforce. “The right balance in the skill-mix ratio for health workers provides optimum healthcare conditions. Contrasting the skillmix ratio with the density of doctors at state levels, an inefficient skill-mix is found to exist between doctor and nurse and doctor and allied health professional in most states in India,” the report said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pandemic-study-reveals-lack-of-trained-health-personnel/articleshow/86380761.cms||Sushmi Dey

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is set to unveil a 15-foot statue of the 9th-century ruler in Dadri on September 22. The event, seen as an attempt by BJP to woo the Gurjar community, comes after Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone of Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh State University in Aligarh, a move widely seen as an effort to win over the Jat community, several of whose members have been leading the protests in wester UP against the new central farming laws. However, the September 22 event does not seem to be going well with some Rajput groups who have traditionally been BJP’s vote bank. Around 200 members associated with outfits representing the Rajput community broke the locks of the panchayat ghar in Dadri’s Pyawali village on Sunday and held a panchayat a day after some unidentified persons pulled down posters of the September 22 event. “They (BJP) are giving a lollipop to a certain group. They are forgetting the 14% for the 4%,” said Rishipal Parmar of the Akhil Bharatiya Kshatriya Mahasabha, a Rajput outfit. Parmar said the Rajputs were objecting to terming Samrat Mihir Bhoj a “Gurjar leader”. Gurjar outfits, meanwhile, have cited history and available literature to stress that the ruler was always known to belong to their community. Ravindra Bhati, a Gurjar leader who was RLD’s Vidhan Sabha candidate from Dadri constituency in the 2017 elections and is now with Azad Samaj Party of Chandrashekhar Azad, told TOI that the inauguration of the erstwhile NH-24 by former Delhi CM Sahib Singh Verma was done in the name of Gurjar Samrat Mihir Bhoj. “In my personal view, the latest sequence of events exhibits an internal dispute within BJP,” he said. On Sunday, members of Rajput groups led by the Rashtriya Karni Sena and Rajput Utthan Sabha held a panchayat at Pyawali village without permission after breaking the locks of the panchayat ghar. An FIR has been registered against 200 unknown persons under sections of the IPC and the Epidemic Diseases Act. Meanwhile, two groups led by the Gurjar Vidya Sabha and Rajput Mahasabha held a joint press conference on Monday to put up a “united front” stating that the dispute witnessed between the two communities was actually an act of “immature youngsters”. “We are both respected leaders of Gurjar Vidya Sabha and Rajput Mahasabha and we are seeing that the atmosphere created ahead of the CM’s visit to Dadri should be stopped in time. The Rajput brothers have no problem with the name used. Tomorrow, if the Rajputs call the king as their own king, we will not have a problem because our roots are really the same,” said Radha Charan Bhati of Gurjar Vidya Sabha. Rajput Mahasabha spokesperson Devendra Khatana said, “We think they have installed a statue, they have a right. We will not object to it when they have installed it on the college campus.” Some Rajput groups, however, have called it a political show. “Rajputs are on the road and there is anger among the youths. These elders don’t represent the feelings of the youth,” said Parmar. Asked about the CM’s event, he added, “Police have filed an FIR for holding a panchayat. We will express our opposition to this but not by taking law and order in our hands.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/elders-put-up-united-front-on-mihir-bhoj-but-panchayat-doesnt-agree/articleshow/86381828.cms||Shikha Salaria
---||India||Under fire, Congress says will fight Punjab polls under both Channi, Sidhu||CHANDIGARH/NEW DELHI: A row erupted in Punjab Congress on Monday after senior leader Sunil Jakhar slammed AICC state in-charge Harish Rawat for purportedly saying the party would go to the 2022 polls under the leadership of state unit chief Navjot Singh Sidhu. The chatter around Jakhar’s dissent on the day of the swearing-in of Punjab’s first Dalit Sikh chief minister Charanjit Singh Channi forced a clarification from Congress, which denied Rawat had made any such remark and said the party would face the electorate under the collective leadership of Channi and PCC chief Sidhu. Opposition BJP promptly latched on to Jakhar’s statement to question the Congress claiming credit for installing a Dalit Sikh CM, saying Channi would only be keeping the seat warm for a few months. The issue was prickly for Congress given the impression that Sidhu would be the party’s “face” in the polls and he had been overlooked only so that deposed chief minister Amarinder Singh wasn’t further provoked. Tagging a news agency report quoting Rawat, Jakhar took to Twitter to say this was not acceptable. "On the swearing-in day of Channi as chief minisiter, Mr Rawat’s statement that ‘elections will be fought under Sidhu’ is baffling. It’s likely to undermine the CM’s authority but also negate the very ‘raison d’être’ of his selection for this position,” Jakhar said. The former state unit chief, who is seen as peeved at having narrowly lost out in the race for the top post, implied that Rawat had projected Channi as a stop gap arrangement for the polls. The AICC denied that Rawat had made any such statement projecting Sidhu. “Our face will be Sardar Charanjit Singh Channi and Sardar Navjot Singh Sidhu as also ordinary Congress workers and important leaders, who will be supporting them. The leadership role is assigned to him as CM of Punjab and he will be our face along with our PCC president, which is natural,” spokesman Randeep Surjewala told reporters. He quoted Rawat as saying that his “statement was not seen in the right perspective by some friends”. The statement, with reference to both Sidhu and Channi, however, failed to clarify the charge that it might be Sidhu who is the high command’s choice and the new CM was seen as a “safe” interim bet. Jakhar expressed vindication by citing Surjewala’s clarification. “Rahul Gandhi has picked Channi as the new CM. Rawat is a senior leader and such a statement on this day should have been avoided. Rahulji took note of my concerns and the party has clarified. Under the leadership of Soniaji and Rahulji, both Channi and Sidhu will work together,” he told reporters. While Channi’s swearing in and first day in office got off to a rocking start, with a show of unity and enthusiasm in state Congress, and continuing excitement over a dalit becoming the CM of Punjab, Jakhar’s dissent showed that there are raw nerves in the unit, which has been mired in chaos for last few months. It further highlighted the tough challenge the Congress faces in balancing the aspirations of an ambitious Sidhu and a CM whose appointment is being cited by the party as major evidence of its commitment to social justice. For some, Jakhar is nursing grievance of losing out in the race for the CM. He trained his guns at Rawat and veteran Ambika Soni, whose public comment that CM of Punjab should be a Sikh was seen as having scuppered Jakhar’s chances.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/under-fire-congress-says-will-fight-punjab-polls-under-both-channi-sidhu/articleshow/86381788.cms||---
---||World||US President Biden administration seeks to lift US refugee cap to 125,000||WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden's administration wants to nearly double the number of refugees admitted to the United States to 125,000 in the upcoming fiscal year starting on October 1 in keeping with a campaign promise, according to a statement from the State Department. The State Department will consult with the Department of Homeland Security and Congress to lift the cap, which was set at 62,500 for the 2020 fiscal year ending this month, the statement said. The plan to dramatically increase refugee admissions comes at a time when tens of thousands of Afghan refugees are on US military bases awaiting resettlement in the United States. Many still at risk were left behind in the chaotic final days of the withdrawal of US forces. Biden, a Democrat, who took office in January, promised to reverse course after his predecessor Republican President Donald Trump cut the refugee cap to just 15,000, the lowest level in the history of the modern refugee program. Biden initially left that level in place, but backtracked in the face of criticism from immigration advocates. Biden has struggled with mixed messaging on immigration. Apprehensions at the US-Mexico border are at 20-year highs, and most recently, thousands of mainly Haitian migrants have set up a makeshift encampment under an international bridge in southern Texas. The refugee program is distinct from the asylum system, since refugees typically apply for relief abroad, are vetted extensively and then are given legal status and resources to establish themselves in the United States. Asylum seekers can present themselves to border agents and claim fear of return, triggering a long US court process. But since March 2020, at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic most border crossers have been rapidly expelled under a public health order without a chance to apply for asylum.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/president-biden-seeks-to-increase-number-of-refugees-admitted-to-us-state-department-says/articleshow/86381991.cms||---

The record suggested that Indore required only inoculation of 45,000 people with their second dose to achieve 50% full immunisation of its adult population. The district with an estimated 28.07 lakh adult population so far administered two doses to 13.58 lakh people to complete their full immunisation. District immunisation in-charge Dr Tarun Gupta said, “We are targeting to complete full immunisation of the adult population as soon as possible in accordance with instruction of the state government.” “Half of targeted full immunisation will be achieved in the next couple of days. With this, we will be first to reach this feat. The district is better than other ones in state”, said Dr Tarun Gupta. The district on August 31 became the first million plus district in the country to achieve cent percent first dose inoculation. But the overall picture is not very rosy as people are showing a reluctance and hesitancy in getting their second dose administration done in district as well as state. There are around six lakh people who have completed their gap between both the doses but aren’t walking to sites for taking their second dose.The hesitancy could be understood by the fact that for the first time during a mega drive-in last week the district failed to achieve in days’ target by 20 percent. Meanwhile in the day the district inoculated 32,422 persons with their respective doses with around 80% of doses being administered as second and were in age 18-44, showed record. The district so far inoculated 28.72 lakh people with their first dose of Covid vaccines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/indore-set-to-become-1st-dist-with-50-fully-immunised-adult-popn/articleshow/86378825.cms||Antriksh Singh

The new rules mean people vaccinated in India will still have to home quarantine for 10 days in the UK when those vaccinated in scores of other countries will not. Aware of the backlash on social media after senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor pulled out of a Cambridge Union debate and his own book launch events in Britain to protest against the latest curbs, the UK announced it was willing to engage with the Indian government to resolve the matter.

Rajya Sabha MP and Congress politician Anand Sharma said the UK government’s decision to not recognise fully vaccinated Indians is "discriminatory, racist and deserves the strongest condemnation". In a series of tweets on Monday, Sharma said Covishield is the same as Astrazeneca in UK and manufactured under license by Serum Institute of India and exported to European countries, including UK. He also said that the vaccine has also been approved by the WHO. "A humiliation of India — the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer. Indian students & citizens are being harassed and fleeced for exorbitant tests.

On September 17, the UK had announced new rules for international travel to replace the current system of red, amber and green. The new rules divide countries into red and the rest of the world and come into effect at 4 am (UK time) on October 4. Whilst the red list rules will remain the same regardless of vaccination status, the rules for people arriving in the UK from the "rest of the world" – which includes India – will differ depending on whether the traveller is "fully vaccinated" or not. Those deemed as "fully vaccinated" will no longer have to home quarantine for 10 days, no longer need to take a pre-departure test, nor take a day 8 Covid-19 test. They just need to take a Covid-19 test on day 2 after they arrive. But people vaccinated in India will be treated as "unvaccinated" as the UK only considers fully vaccinated to be those who have been vaccinated under an approved vaccination programme in the UK, Europe or the US, or who were vaccinated in 17 other countries, including Australia, Israel, Japan and Singapore. India, Pakistan and many other countries are not on that list. Those vaccinated in India will still have home quarantine for 10 days, take a pre-departure Covid test and take Covid tests on days 2 and 8. National Indian Students and Alumni Union (NISAU) UK chairperson Sanam Arora slammed the measures as "bizarre" given that Covishield is the "same drug" as the AstraZeneca vaccine administered to UK residents.

The two 6-year-olds were experiencing a classroom that wasn’t on a mobile phone screen for the first time, 17 months after they were enrolled into school. Class hadn’t begun with a mobile notification but the gong of a bell, parents weren’t around for a cuddle and an untimely toffee, and there was no option to switch off video and stretch out on the chair. This isn’t how they had known school. On Monday, scores of kids got their first taste of school life after classes 1-3 were called back to campus across the state. Junior classes had opened this March briefly, for barely a couple of weeks and with very low attendance, before the Covid wave struck. Since the pandemic shut down campuses in March 2020, this was the first full-fledged return to school. Concern over big learning gaps due to prolonged online classesAttendance was below 50% and it was mostly government schools that opened for physical classes. But for the little ones whose schooling began with online classes because of the pandemic that shut down campuses last March, it was an occasion – part confusing, part memorable, part fun. Pratik and Nancy, friends with each other’s voices since they enrolled in Class II of Bajghera Government School, were meeting for the first time. Nancy said she was both worried and excited – she would be finally meeting her friends, but “I didn’t know if my friends would like me”. Pratik was upset about being made to sit far away from his friends – on a bench all by himself and with strict instructions not to move around. “I wanted to sit near my friends, but the teachers did not allow me. But my teachers were nice to me,” said the 6-year-old, who had seen his cousins wear uniforms and go to school and had finally done that himself. On the first day of resumption, government schools recorded 40% attendance on an average. Private schools, however, have decided to adopt a wait-and-watch policy. Many of them have sent Google Sheets to take feedback from parents on calling back junior students. At Model Sanskriti School, 92 of 150 students attended class on Monday. The turnout at Bajghera Government School was also good. “It was more than what we expected. More students should join in a few days. The students were happy and excited to be back to school. So were the teachers,” said Manoj Lakhra, the principal of Bajghera Government School. At the government school in Kadipur, 389 of 935 students of classes I to III turned up. Principal Sattan Pal admitted many parents were still apprehensive about sending their kids to school. “Some parents are still undecided about sending their children to school. However, we hope to see more students in the next 2-3 days,” he added. There is all-round concern on big learning gaps because of a prolonged period of online classes. After the second wave passed and cases fell, even private schools started recalling students in the senior classes back to campus in phases.  A section of parents has, however, pointed out that children are yet to be vaccinated and returning to school exposes them to the pandemic. Some teachers admitted it was more difficult to make kids follow Covid protocols by themselves. “Teachers are under extreme pressure to bring kids back to school. A number of parents are still sceptical. Those who are sending their children are asking us why we are not distributing mid-day meals. In keeping with government orders, we have been distributing dry ration at home. But parents want their kids to be fed at school,” said Dushyant Thakaran, the district head of Haryana Prathmik Siksha Sangh. In some schools, the lack of support staff is worrying. “In these schools, teachers themselves have been sweeping floors and sanitising classrooms. This is in addition to teaching kids, distributing ration and other assignments,” Thakaran said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/gurugram-when-school-isnt-a-screen-for-first-time/articleshow/86382979.cms||Sagrika Kissu

The development was reported by the publication Morning Context. When TOI contacted Amazon, the company said, “We have zero tolerance for corruption. We take allegations of improper actions seriously, investigate them fully, and take appropriate action. We are not commenting on specific allegations or the status of any investigation at this time.” The Morning Context article said Amazon had sent its senior counsel on leave pending probe. It also said an independent advocate in Delhi, who works with Amazon as an outside counsel, was the one who funnelled the money paid by Amazon to bribe government officials. The allegations, if true, are a violation of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits the payment of bribes to foreign officials to assist in obtaining or retaining business. Over the years, the US has imposed fines on a number of companies for cases of bribery in India. In 2016, Cognizant Technology Solutions disclosed a corruption issue it found in India to the US SEC. The company was made to pay $25 million in penalties. The case related to Cognizant’s campus in Chennai where a senior Tamil Nadu government official allegedly was paid a bribe to facilitate construction at the campus. Among others against whom FCPA enforcement actions were taken for bribery in India include Embraer, Anheuser-Busch InBev, Mondelez/ Cadbury, Oracle, Tyco International, Dow Chemical, Pride International, Textron, and Diageo, according to a report by law firm Foley & Lardner. The SEC said Embraer paid nearly $6 million to an agent in India in connection with the sale of three highly specialised military aircraft. Houston-based offshore oil drilling company Pride International coughed up a $56.1 million fine after it made payments for favourable administrative judicial decisions regarding customs issues in India. The SEC charged Diageo with making $2.7 million in improper payments to government officials in India, Thailand, and South Korea. Cadbury/ Mondelez International paid $13 million in penalties for violations that included one in India where it allegedly made illicit payments to obtain government licenses and approvals for a chocolate factory in Baddi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/amazon-probing-bribery-complaint-in-india-report/articleshow/86383050.cms||---
---||Jamshedpur||Jharkhand: East Singhbhum nod to doorstep delivery of Durga Puja prasad||JAMSHEDPUR: The East Singhbhum district administration has said though "bhog" distribution cannot be done at the Durga Puja pandals, the organising committee can make arrangements for its home delivery to the homes of devotees and patrons. Additional district magistrate (law and order) Nand Kishore Lal said the upcoming Durga Puja celebrations should not be allowed to spread the Covid-19 infection, leading to a third wave, under any circumstances. Earlier, senior BJP leader Abhay Singh had asked the state government to lift the ban on “bhog” distribution. Lal also said minors are not allowed near the puja pandals and the organizing committee members are fully responsible to ensure implementation of the orders. He underlined that only vaccinated committee members and priests will be allowed inside the pandals and near the deity. Lal warned that flying squads will make surprise inspections of the puja pandals and stringent action will be initiated against those committees flouting the rules. He further said the earlier government order to set up only small pandals, the cap on idol heights at five feet and no decoration or welcome gates still stands. Social distancing near the pandals is a must and there should not be any kind of crowding at any place, Lal said. Lal further said loudspeakers can be used only during the chanting of “mantras” by the priests and not for any other purpose. The district magistrate added that though the Covid numbers have come down considerably in East Singhbhum and the state, the fear of a third wave persists. Meanwhile, personnel of police stations concerned will meet “Shanti Samitis” of the Durga Puja organisers next week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/e-singhbhum-nod-to-doorstep-delivery-of-durga-puja-prasad/articleshow/86378363.cms||Debasish Chatterjee
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru may see thundershowers for 2 more days||BENGALURU: Several areas, including Raj Bhavan Road, Palace Road, Vidyaranyapura, Koramangala and Avenue Road, were waterlogged after heavy rain lashed several parts of the city on Monday afternoon. The city will receive rainfall or thundershowers for the next two days with a generally cloudy sky, says IMD report. Southwest monsoon was weak over the state on Monday and several stations across the state recorded light to moderate rainfall. Only Bangarpet in Kolar recorded heavy rain (7cm). A low-pressure area over eastern Rajasthan, the cyclonic circulation over Tamil Nadu and the trough from south interior Karnataka to Kanyakumari are the systems influencing the state weather. A yellow alert has been issued for Mysuru, Chamarajanagar, Bengaluru Urban and Rural, Kolar, Chikkamagaluru, Hassan, Chikkaballapur and Kodagu districts. As per data from BBMP control room, tree branches fell at several places near Konanakunte, Bowring Institute, Raj Bhavan Road an CMH Road, while one was uprooted on Infantry Road. Hrs after rain, Avenue Road inundated. Avenue Road inundatedEven four hours after rain stopped, several markets in and around Avenue Road remained flooded on Monday. Sajjan Raj Mehta, trade activist and a merchant from the area, said: “When we contact BBMP, they say BWSSB is responsible. BWSSB officials say Bengaluru Smart City project is to blame and Smart City officials place the blame for the mess on city’s major roads. This is a perfect example of what happens when there is absolutely no coordination between civic bodies.” Traders on Avenue Road claim that every time they face a situation like this, the civic body fixes it temporarily. “We want a permanent solution for this kind of flooding. Had it rained for another hour, water would have entered shops,” added Mehta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bluru-may-see-thundershowers-for-2-more-days/articleshow/86383288.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Vijayawada-based shell company used as front to smuggle Rs 20,900 crore Afghan heroin||VIJAYAWADA: A nondescript house on the outskirts of Andhra Pradesh’s Vijayawada has suddenly become the talk of the town after the seizure of one of the biggest consignments of heroin at Mundra port in Gujarat last week. The narcotics stock, valued at around Rs 20,900 crore, was seized by sleuths of Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) from two shipping containers that had arrived from Afghanistan via Bandar Abbas port in Iran. The Vijayawada link in the whole thing came to light as the ‘talcum powder’ consignment was imported by Aashi Trading company, the address of which is the nondescript yellow-coloured house located on an isolated corner of a street in Satyanarayanapuram area of the city. The place was found to be rented in the name of the trading company by a woman from Chennai, identified as Govindaraju Durga Purna Vaishali. DRI sources said the company’s contact number is linked to one Machavaram Sudhakar, who is the husband of Vaishali and a native of AP’s Kakinada. The import and export licence (IEC code) of the company is in the name of Vaishali, while its GST registration was done on August 18, 2020.  The couple has been staying in Chennai for the past eight years in a rented apartment in Kolapakam area of the city. Sources said Vaishali has been taken into custody by DRI, while Sudhakar, who is suspected to be the prime accused, is on the run. Vijayawada police commissioner B Sreenivasulu told TOI that the consignment was actually headed to Delhi. "The heroin in the guise of talcum powder was intended to reach Delhi, not Vijayawada. So far, we have found no proof of any Vijayawada connection in the whole thing except the importing company’s address. We are in coordinating with the DRI and investigating the case from all angles,” he said, adding that Aashi Trading seems to have been used as a shell company to obtain import and export licence for illegal smuggling. Barring the name and GST registration number of the firm, which was found to be typed on an A4 sheet paper and pasted on the wall of the house, there’s nothing in the vicinity to suggest that a company exists there. People staying in the neighbourhood said the place has remained shut since many months. However, prior to that, they do acknowledge that they have seen consignments being dropped and picked up from the place. “We were told by a caretaker of the place once that the company deals with food essentials such as rice, fruits, vegetables, etc. But the place has remained locked since long,” a woman residing in the same neighbourhood said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/andhra-shell-firm-used-as-front-to-smuggle-rs-20900cr-afghan-heroin/articleshow/86383310.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

At several places, power was switched off as a precautionary measure. Reservoirs went under water in several apartments. The situation improved a bit from the evening after the lockgates were opened and KMC pumps begun to work. In New Market’s older portion, traders did not open shops in the morning after water got accumulated in the rear side. “I woke up to see water seeping into my drawing room. By 8am water had entered my car. With power supply in the area regulated, I gave up the idea of going to office,” said Asit Mitra, a publishing house staffer and resident of Madan Mohan Burman Street. Traffic was slow on APC Road.

With transatlantic flights traditionally among the most lucrative for Europe's biggest airlines, the Monday announcement was "formidable news" for a sector that has haemorrhaged tens of billions of euros over the past 18 months, Air France-KLM chief Benjamin Smith said. For most of Europe's flag carriers -- such as Air France, British Airways and Lufthansa -- the restrictions on long-haul routes across the Atlantic were particularly hard to swallow. Air France-KLM, for example, generates 40 percent of its sales from its North Atlantic services, and for Germany's Lufthansa, the proportion is 50 percent. "Today's news... marks an historic moment," said British Airways chief Sean Doyle. "Our customers should now feel that the world is reopening to them and they can book their trips with confidence." US airlines such as United, Delta and American are much more domestically orientated and less dependent on international services, which account for 25-30 percent of revenues. But they, too, welcomed the news. "Today's announcement marks a positive step in our nation's recovery," said the head of the industry association Airlines for America, Nicholas Calio. Sister organisation Airlines for Europe tweeted that it similarly "applauds the decision", which would "give a much-needed boost to trans-Atlantic traffic & #tourism and will reunite families and friends". The International Air Transport Association, or IATA, which has 290 member airlines accounting for 82 percent of global air travel, described it as "a major step forward". "This is excellent news for families and loved ones... It's good for the millions of livelihoods in the US that depend on global tourism. And it will boost the economic recovery by enabling some key business travel markets," IATA director general Willie Walsh said. IATA has been calling for months now for travel restrictions to be "guided by the science" and take into account travellers' vaccination status. Europe's airlines had been hoping for transatlantic routes to be reopened in time for the key summer holiday season. But while Europe reopened its internal borders, Washington remained cautious. And transatlantic traffic this year was less than half than the levels recorded in 2019. The US decision was "actually a little later than we expected given what we know about how effective the vaccines are. We expected it in the summertime," said Colin Scarola, an analyst at CFRA Research. But even if European airlines are now ready to restart the engines of more aircraft heading across the Atlantic, recovery will still be slow, warned George Dimitroff, an analyst at air transport data specialist Ascend by Cirium. "We would not expect to see an increase in airline schedules right away, apart from the busiest routes," he said. "There may be additional capacity added around the year-end holiday period, but the more significant improvements are likely to come in March 2022 when airlines gear up for their summer schedules," he said. Burkett Huey, an analyst at Morningstar, pointed out that "if you don't fill an aircraft at 75-80 percent, the trip won't be profitable. You need travellers from both sides." Dimitroff said he expected "business travel to start to pick up in the fourth quarter of this year... as European business travellers will be able to visit US clients and suppliers." But analyst Scarola was more cautious. "While it is definitely a step in the right direction, it really does not improve the uncertainty around the two key things that are going to be needed for international travel recovery: how is the pandemic going to play out in the coming months... and will a big piece of business travel be missing because of the virtual meeting tools that are now available?"||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/airline-sector-relieved-over-lifting-of-us-travel-ban/articleshow/86383486.cms||---

While the vehicle was identified from a number plate that came loose and fell at the spot after it dashed into the kerb, its driver is on the run. The woman’s husband, Ramkaran Sharma (47), who is from Agra, told police that he, his wife Neeraj and their daughter Anjali returned to Noida around 1am after a pilgrimage to Mathura’s Govardhan and were looking for transport to reach their home in Sector 101. Ramkaran said he was talking to an auto driver a few metres away when a Scorpio came speeding from the Shashi Chowk side, broke the railing around the green belt and crashed into Neeraj and Anjali. “The driver reversed the SUV and knocked me down too,” he said. While Ramkaran suffered injuries in his arms, Neeraj and Ankita had serious injuries in the head and other parts of the body. Cops reached the accident spot, which is located 50 metres from the Sector 37 police chowki, and rushed the family to Kailash Hospital in Sector 27. Staff at the hospital said Neeraj and Anjali were unconscious when they were brought around 1.15 am and declared dead after examination. A police officer said the teenager was breathing on the way to the medical facility. “The girl was declared dead around 2.16am. Her mother had been bleeding heavily from her mouth and nose. She had abrasions from abdomen and forearm and was declared brought dead,” Dr Sarika Chandra, medical officer at the hospital, said. Sector 39 SHO Rajiv Baliyan said with the help of the broken number plate, the Scorpio owner was identified as Amit Chauhan, a property dealer in Sector 53’s Gijhore village. Sub-inspector Pramod Kumar said his house was locked and only his tenants — he has rented out two floors — were present when cops went to arrest him. An FIR has been lodged against Chauhan under IPC sections 304A (death due to negligence), 279 (rash driving) and 338 (grievous hurt to any person by doing any act so rashly or negligently as to endanger human life) at the Sector 39 police station. In the past three months, this is the fourth case of hit-and-run in Noida. Similar incidents were reported from Phase III police station area and sectors 108 and 45. None of the accused has been arrested so far in any of the cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/girl-mother-waiting-on-footpath-run-over/articleshow/86380993.cms||Shikha Salaria

The cyclonic circulation that originated over northwest and west-central Bay of Bengal lay centered over northwest Bay of Bengal and adjoining north Odisha on Monday, extending 1.5km to 5.8km above mean sea level with a southward tilt causing light to moderate rainfall in the state. Acting director, IMD Ranchi, Abhishek Anand, said the southern Jharkhand districts received moderate to heavy rainfall under the influence of the cyclonic circulation. “Arki block in Khunti district received 67mm rainfall during the past 24 hours. Over the next three-four days, the entire state is likely to receive light to moderate rainfall,” he said. The withdrawal of monsoon is delayed this year. Normally, the monsoon starts withdrawing by September 15 but this year, the weatherman expects the withdrawal to begin by first week of October. Because of the monsoon remaining active, entire Jharkhand is going to experience intermitting rainfall till the second fortnight of October. As on Monday, the monsoon trough passed through Daltonganj to the region of cyclonic circulation in north Odisha. During the monsoon season, that is from June 1 to present date (September 20), Jharkhand has received 937.8mm rainfall as against the seasonal normal of 986.2mm indicating a deficit of 5%. Anand said since the monsoon is still active over the state and a system of cyclonic circulation is also there, the shortfall in seasonal rainfall is likely to be mitigated. “We can expect light to moderate rainfall all over the state during the next three-four days which will considerably compensate for the shortfall,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/monsoon-remains-active-more-rain-likely/articleshow/86378360.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

---||Delhi||Did you help real estate companies in bad phase, SC asks Noida bodies||NEW DELHI: As the Noida and Greater Noida authorities pleaded with the Supreme Court to recall its order to cap interest rate for delayed payments by builders at around 8% as they would otherwise lose around Rs 7,500 crore, the Supreme Court said a balance has to be maintained between competing interests of builders and authorities. The court sought response on whether the authorities had provided a helping hand when the real estate sector was passing through its worst phase a few years ago. The apex court was examining a joint plea filed by Noida and Greater Noida authorities to recall its order passed in June last year capping interest rate around 8%, instead of 15-23%. The court had passed the order keeping in view the need to “give impetus” to the real estate sector and taking into account the financial conditions of many companies which were struggling to survive due to the economic slowdown and the Covid-19 pandemic. Appearing before a bench of Justices U U Lalit and Ajay Rastogi, advocate Ravindra Kumar contended the authorities would be “ruined” financially as they will end up losing around Rs 7,500 crore if the order is not recalled and this will lead to “unjust enrichment” of builders. He said that last year's order was passed during the Amrapali case without examining all issues. He said the court is examining ways to protect the interest of Amrapali homebuyers and other builders were party in the case but the order passed was general in nature applicable to all developers. Responding to a query on financial implications, Kumar told the bench that Greater Noida would lose around Rs 4,279 and Noida authority would have to forgo Rs 3,266 crore in the impact of the order. He said builders themselves demand interest rate around 20% compounded monthly from homebuyers for delay in payment. Kumar also said that after the SC’s order, not only builders of housing societies, but those who were allotted land for commercial and institutional purposes were also demanding cut in the interest rate. The bench, however, asked the authorities on what steps were taken to help the builders. The bench said it was not concerned about any company but about the sector. “Let us go back three years back when the real estate sector was badly affected. My question is: Did authorities come forward to take case of them with some policy decision in those time as a gesture of support the real estate sector?” Justice Rastogi asked Kumar. It also said that builders also faced difficulty with the aggrieved homebuyers seeking refund and the order is invariable passed against builder in case of delay in completion of project. “A balance has to be maintained,” the bench said and asked authorities to respond on the next date of hearing on steps taken by them when the real estate sector was badly hit. The court, however, had made it clear that if the builders failed to clear the dues within reasonable time, the concession granted will be withdrawn.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/did-you-help-real-estate-cos-in-bad-phase-sc-asks-noida-bodies/articleshow/86383638.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

They are yet to get any communication from the TTD, and are clueless whether they would be allowed to even take part in the trust board’s meetings. Nor do they have any idea if they would be formally sworn in as special invitees, as has been the practice in the past. The government issued four separate orders — GO numbers 213, 245, 568 and 569 — through which the chairman, member trustees, ex-officio members, and two categories of special invitees were nominated to the trust board to manage the affairs of the richest Hindu temple in the world.

However, another girl ended up losing 149 marks, as her score dipped from 445 in July to 296 in the last exam. Fortunes swung wildly when results of II PU exam were announced on Monday. Of the 592 freshers, who rejected their tabulated results in July and wrote the exam, 471 improved their scores and 121 registered a dip. The candidate who improved his score by 203 marks saw the highest jump. A candidate, who had scored 590 in II PU results of July, topped the exam results, securing 594. The department of pre-university education had cancelled the examinations for II PU courses considering the spike in Covid-19 cases across the state and promoted all fresh and repeater candidates. Their marks were calculated based on their SSLC, I PU and II PU internal marks and the results were announced on July 20; 2,239 students had secured 600 out of 600. However, the department allowed students to take the exam in August/September, along with private candidates, if they were not satisfied with the results. They were considered fresh and according to the rules, could not go back to their July scores, whatever the August outcome. Of 90 in Ballari, 9 at lossAt Indu PU College in Kottur of Ballari, more than 90 students opted to take the examination and only nine lost marks. Nagesha YH, who scored 168 more marks than he did in July when his score was 414, said support from the college principal helped him write the exam. “I had not worked hard enough in my I PU and so my marks did not reflect my full potential. I am happy with the 97% I have got now,” Nagesha, who hopes to appear for civil services after his degree from Karnataka College, Dharwad, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/80-of-ii-pu-students-improve-performance-some-lose-marks/articleshow/86377975.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas
---||Vijayawada||Vijayawada-based shell firm used as front to smuggle Rs 20,900 crore heroin||VIJAYAWADA: A nondescript house on the outskirts of Vijayawada has suddenly become the talk of the city after the seizure of one of the biggest consignments of heroin at Mundra port in Gujarat last week. The narcotics stock, valued at around Rs 20,900 crore, was seized by sleuths of Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) from two shipping containers that had arrived from Afghanistan via Bandar Abbas port in Iran. The Vijayawada link in the whole thing came to light as the ‘talcum powder’ consignment was imported by Aashi Trading company, the address of which is the nondescript yellow-coloured house located on an isolated corner of Gadiyaramvari street in Satyanarayanapuram area of the city. The place was found to be rented in the name of the trading company by a woman from Chennai, identified as Govindaraju Durga Purna Vaishali. DRI sources said the company’s contact number is linked to one Machavaram Sudhakar, who is the husband of Vaishali and a native of Kakinada. Sources said Vaishali has been taken into custody by DRI, while Sudhakar, who is suspected to be prime accused, is on run The import and export licence (IEC code) of the company is in the name of Vaishali, while its GST registration was done on August 18, 2020. The couple has been staying in Chennai for the past eight years in a rented apartment in Kolapakam area of the city. Sources said Vaishali has been taken into custody by DRI, while Sudhakar, who is suspected to be the prime accused, is on the run. Vijayawada police commissioner B Sreenivasulu told TOI that the consignment was actually headed for Delhi. “The heroin in the guise of talcum powder was intended to reach Delhi, not Vijayawada. So far, we have found no proof of any Vijayawada connection in the whole thing except the importing company’s address.  We are in coordinating with the DRI and investigating the case from all angles,” he said, adding that Aashi Trading seems to have been used as a shell company to obtain import and export licence for illegal smuggling. Barring the name and GST registration number of the firm, which was found to be typed on an A4 sheet paper and pasted on the wall of the house, there’s nothing in the vicinity to suggest that a company exists there. People staying in the neighbourhood said the place has remained shut since many months. However, prior to that, they do acknowledge that they have seen consignments being dropped and picked up from the place. “We were told by a caretaker of the place once that the company deals with food essentials such as rice, fruits, vegetables, etc. But the place has remained locked since long,” a woman residing in the same neighbourhood said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/vij-based-shell-firm-used-as-front-to-smuggle-20900-cr-heroin/articleshow/86377422.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti
---||Chennai||20 reasons and 2 routes to eliminate NEET, Justice AK Rajan committee tells Tamil Nadu govt||CHENNAI: The Justice AK Rajan Committee, which studied the impact of National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) on the student community in Tamil Nadu, has listed 20 reasons for elimination of NEET . It suggested the twin-route of legislative and legal procedures to achieve the purpose. The committee also made seven recommendations that included bringing all deemed universities under the purview of the state government. The 165-page report, submitted to the government in July 2021, was released to the media on Monday. The contents of the report were first reported by TOI on July 15. Among the 20 points for opposing NEET were arguments that NEET neglected Class XII marks and promoted private coaching, and that it denied opportunities to tribal, rural and oppressed students. Also, the report said the percentage of rural students came down from 65.17% in 2016-17 in the pre-NEET year, to 49.91% in 2020-21. The number of Tamil medium students allotted the MBBS seats also came down from 14.88% in 2016-17 to a mere 1.99% in 2020-21. Likewise, the percentage of state board students getting MBBS seats also plummeted from 65.66% in 2016-17 to 48.22% in 2017-18 while the percentage of CBSE students has increased from 0.39% to 24.91% in just one year after the introduction of NEET. The number of government school students getting MBBS admissions also decreased from 34 students to just three students after NEET and no student from government schools got admitted to government medical colleges in 2017-18. The number of first-generation graduates getting the seats also came down from 24.9% to 13.6% after the introduction of NEET in Tamil Nadu. Students whose parents annual income is less than 2.5lakhs per annum also come down from 47.42% before NEET to 30.6% after NEET. Before NEET, 87.5% current-year students entered medical colleges, but it got reduced to 28.5% in 2020-21 as 71.4% repeaters grabbed the medical seats. The report also said the students were shelling out Rs 1 lakh to Rs 4.5 lakh per annum for coaching classes. Justice Rajan Committee, therefore, asked the government to bring in a Bill to bin NEET and get the President's assent for the legislation. Reverting to Class XII marks-based admission to MBBS courses by adopting normalisation of scores to bring in equality among boards would be the solution, it said. "This will ensure social justice and protect all vulnerable student communities from being discriminated against in admission to medical education programmes," the committee said in its report. It also advised the government to bring all deemed universities which are now directly under the UGC under the purview of the state government. The committee, headed by Justice Rajan, had eight other members, including six government officials. It received more than 86,000 responses from the public. While more than 65,000 opposed NEET, 18,000 supported NEET and nearly 1,500 had no opinion. The seven points that supported NEET included prevention of blocking of seats and the provision for Tamil Nadu students to enter union government-run colleges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/20-reasons-and-two-routes-to-eliminate-neet-rajan-committee-tells-tn-govt/articleshow/86380019.cms||---
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin asks PM Narendra Modi for 50 lakh additional Covid-19 vaccine doses||CHENNAI: On a day vaccination drive came to a grinding halt, chief minister M K Stalin sought from Prime Minister Narendra Modi 50 lakh additional doses of Covid vaccines and syringes to Tamil Nadu every week to cover all eligible population with the first dose by October 31. In a letter to Modi seeking his intervention for enhanced supply, Stalin thanked the Centre for providing vaccines to the state. The state, he said, exhausts supplies within two to three days of receipt. The two mega camps were a “resounding success” where health workers vaccinated 28.91 lakh people on September 12 and 16.43 lakh a week later on Sunday pushing the dosage tally beyond 4 crore. Meanwhile, the state will resume vaccinations only after fresh allotments from the Centre. The Centre has supplied 3.97 crore doses of Covid vaccine and 2.21 crore (0.5 ml) syringes to the state till September 19. By deriving more doses out of each 10 ml vial, the state has been able to vaccinate 4.13 crore people in government centres, he said. Yet, the state is still below the national average, since it continues to get much lower quantities than other states in terms of per capita vaccine allocation. “Unless the allocation is increased substantially, the state will always be below the national average for those indicators, let alone go above it,” he said. Tamil Nadu stills has a large eligible population which is yet to get vaccinated and this continues to make the state vulnerable for Covid cases, he said. Considering the capacity of the state and the uncovered eligible population, the state has no other option to continue organizing such mega camps at regular intervals in addition to daily vaccinations. “Only this can help us to overcome the low vaccination numbers achieved in the first four months of the vaccination programme,” he said. The state is easily capable of utilizing 50 lakh vaccine doses every week — 5lakh doses/per day for six days and 20 lakh doses for a mega camp on the seventh day of the week, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/stalin-asks-modi-for-50l-addl-covid-19-vax-doses/articleshow/86379900.cms||---

This is the highest-ever tally for any political party in the history of Andhra Pradesh. The principal opposition was nowhere near the ruling party in the contest in any district. In fact, the TDP could not even open its account in seven zilla parishads, and could only secure one seat each in Visakhapatnam, East Godavari, West Godavari, Krishna, Kadapa and Anantapur districts. “The victory is unprecedented as no party ever won such a massive number of seats in local body elections in the state. That the elections were held almost two-and-a-half years after the general elections, reflects the public mood and support for the Jagan Mohan Reddy government,” said political analyst V Ravi, adding that one should appreciate the chief minister’s commitment to fulfil his election promises. The state election commission declared all results of ZPTC and MPTC seats in the wee hours of Monday after completion of counting of votes in all 13 districts. Barring some minor verbal duels and heated moments at a few places, the SEC declared that counting was completed without any untoward incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/ruling-ysrcp-wins-record-98-of-zilla-parishad-seats/articleshow/86377436.cms||Samdani MN

---||India||Congress made Channi ‘stopgap’ CM to tap Dalit votes, says BJP||NEW DELHI: BJP on Monday alleged that Congress made Charanjit Singh Channi the chief minister of Punjab just a few months before the assembly polls only with an eye on Dalit votes and that the stopgap CM will keep the seat warm for Navjot Singh Sidhu who was appointed the state party president recently. Citing Congress leader Sunil Jakhar’s remarks on the statement of AICC Punjab in-charge Harish Rawat that the state polls will be fought under Sidhu, BJP leader Amit Malviya tweeted, “This is a huge insult to the entire Dalit community if Charanjit Singh Channi has been made the CM, only to hold the seat for Navjot Singh Sidhu.” He said, “This completely undermines the Dalit empowerment narrative being peddled by Congress. Shame.” He said Congress claim to have made a Dalit CM in Punjab, only to be posted as a “night watchman”, till Gandhi family loyalist Sidhu takes over, “but maintain deafening silence over lynching of a Dalit youth in Rajasthan”. BJP national spokesperson and Rajya Sabha MP Anil Baluni said Congress’ decades-old tactics of using the Dalit community for political gains has resurfaced. “If an unfortunate incident like Hathras happens, the entire Gandhi family goes on a political tour and for photo ops but have been maintaining a deafening silence elsewhere. I know Congress leaders won’t answer but people of the country will give them an answer once again,” Baluni said. Congress leader Sunil Jakhar had described Rawat’s statement as “baffling”. “It’s likely to undermine the CM’s authority but also negate the very ‘raison d’être’ of his selection for this position,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/congress-made-channi-stopgap-cm-to-tap-dalit-votes-says-bjp/articleshow/86384026.cms||---

Police say she was brutalized with a stick and has suffered internal injuries. The incident took place in Basna region of Mahasamund district on the night of September 17. The 35-year-old woman was alone at home when Milan Bariha forced open the door of her house and raped her, say police. She kept resisting and screaming for help. Bariha got so enraged by this that he picked up a wooden stick and assaulted her private parts. The torture was so brutal that she nearly lost consciousness. Leaving her in agony, the accused fled. When the woman’s family members returned home, they were shocked to see her in a puddle of blood and rushed her to hospital, which referred her to Raipur, around 150km away. A zero FIR was registered at Telibandha police station in Raipur and sent to Basna, following which the 30-year-old accused was arrested on Monday under IPC sections 376 (rape) and 450 (trespass).

No suicide note was found but it is suspected that her father deserting them and the family’s inability to buy her books for financial reasons had impacted her emotionally. Susmita lived with her mother (45) and brother (22) after her father deserted them nine years ago. Their mother ran a roadside eatery and her brother was forced to drop out of studies to work as a driver to make ends meet. Around 10am on Monday, Susmita’s mother left for the eatery, located nearby. When she returned home about an hour later, she found Susmita lying on the floor, unconscious and frothing at her mouth, police said. “The neighbours and relatives took her to CNMC Hospital, where she died around 1.30pm,” said DC (SSD) Rashid Munir Khan. It was found the girl was serious about her studies but could not buy books due to financial crisis. “No suicide note has been found but her family said she had gone into a depression. Also, she was attached to her father and had become insecure in his absence,” said Khan. In another incident, Hajra Pramanik, who was admitted to Medical College and Hospital on September 4 after he tried to end life by hanging, died on Sunday. “Pramanik, who ran a barber shop in Jadavpur East, was an alcoholic. Their family had a get-together on the evening of September 4 but Pramanik returned home drunk. This led to a fight with his wife, following which he hanged himself,” said Khan. A computer engineer from Patna, who was employed with a top IT firm in Sector V, was also found to have died by suicide. Vikas Kumar Singh’s death was discovered after his uncle, who lived near his rented apartment in Jadavpur, could not contact him over phone and visited his place to check on him, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/unable-to-buy-books-16-year-old-ends-life/articleshow/86379495.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

A single judge bench comprising Justice K Lalitha heard the matter. Senior counsel B Aadinarayana appearing for Sambasiva Rao argued that the state government intentionally filed a case on an issue that took place six years ago. He submitted to the court that the state government should seek the permission of the Centre before filing a case against an official in the central service. He also submitted that the Railways will suspend the IRTS official if he is remanded for more than 48 hours and asked the court to grant bail. Jasti Nagabushan, government pleader for CID, argued the accused will influence the witness and other accused if he is released on bail. The court disagreed with the arguments of the CID and granted bail to Sambasiva Rao and asked him to support the police in its inquiry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hc-grants-bail-to-former-incap-chief/articleshow/86378244.cms||Venu Lanka

The move came after Shah was named in the Sebi investigation into the insider trading at Magma, now renamed Poonawalla Fincorp after it was taken over. Chairman Adar Poonawalla has said that the company is carrying out an independent investigation too into the recent events that led to the exit of Bhutada. The markets regulator’s probe had showed that, in February this year, eight people — led by Bhutada — together made a profit of about Rs 13.5 crore by trading in the shares of Magma Fincorp during its acquisition by Poonawalla Group. At that time, Shah, named in the investigation report, was with another firm that advised Poonawalla Group in this acquisition. Replying to TOI’s queries, a spokesperson for KPMG said that the firm takes independence and non-compliance with its policies and regulations extremely seriously. “The individual concerned was not a partner in KPMG during the period that he undertook these transactions in February, 2021 and (it) had no knowledge of these violations until the Sebi report was published,” the spokesperson said. “He had joined the firm in May 2021 and has been separated from the firm since the incident came to our knowledge. (KPMG) remains committed to ensuring full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and conduct by (its) people that is fully aligned to KPMG’s values.” The Sebi report was made public on September 15. The next day, the NBFC’s managing director Bhutada resigned, after initially denying all the charges. Sebi had barred Bhutada, Shah and six other connected entities from the market for insider trading. Its initial investigations had showed that these entities together used illegal means and profited by about Rs 13.5 crore through the trades. Sebi had also ordered impounding of the bank accounts of these eight entities. In an investor call held on Saturday (September 18), Adar Poonawalla said Bhutada will also be cleared of what he’s done, because he hasn’t done anything, according to the lawyers and others (who have given him the reports). He further added that Bhutada has stepped down according to corporate governance standards. He further said, “We have a strong leadership team available through a healthy mix of the new and old team and are well-positioned to continue according to the business plan.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/named-in-magma-case-kpmg-ousts-partner/articleshow/86380939.cms||Partha Sinha

---||Business||Indians lap up China-focused mutual funds||MUMBAI: Indian investors are pouring money into China-focused mutual funds even as a regulatory crackdown by Beijing has knocked off over $1 trillion from the combined market capitalisation of tech giants like Alibaba and Tencent this year. Though a niche category with only two fund houses — Edelweiss and Axis — offering these schemes, assets under management (AUM) have continued to rise despite negative returns this year (see graphic). Axis Greater China Equity fund, which was launched in February this year, has seen its AUM grow 4 times to Rs 120 crore in August from about Rs 30 crore in February-end, even as NAV fell by 14% in the same time. Edelweiss Greater China Equity Off-Shore Fund has seen its AUM grow 62% to Rs 1,808 crore in August from about Rs 1,119 crore at the end of 2020, even as the net asset value (NAV) fell over 6% in the same period. Both have the fund of funds (FoF) structure, where the capital is invested in underlying schemes, which in turn buy stocks in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan (greater China region). “We are getting inflows consistently…smart investors are adding more, a lot of people were waiting on the fence to invest in China. July was one of the best months for inflows in the greater China fund. Even August and this month has seen good flows,” said Niranjan Avasthi, head of products, marketing and digital at Edelweiss MF. Axis MF too is seeing a steady rise in investor interest and its fund has recorded net inflows since inception. “The biggest category in the fund are mature investors, who have the understanding about what is the role of allocation to China in their portfolios. Informed investors are also aware that though the China market has given decent returns, it has been highly volatile historically,” said Ashwin Patni, head of products and alternatives at Axis MF. The Edelweiss fund has about 20% exposure to the technology sector, which is facing the brunt of the regulatory crackdown. “China wants to cut down monopolies, chart clear paths along with some social aspects. The China story is shifting from export-driven economy to domestic-driven…mainland China market is also getting added to emerging market indices, because of which global inflows will increase further,” Avasthi said, adding that the pain in the tech sector should smoothen out in a year. “China has a very high-growth environment. But it is also a market that has a very heavy trader component, that is why we see very big ups and downs from time to time. So, investors who come without this context can be put off,” Patni said. Currently, global funds are a small space, China is even smaller. However, investment in international markets will increase gradually and can reach 10% of equity allocation in a few years, according to Patni. A Goldman Sachs report released last week also quoted economists saying that China is still investable as regulations aren’t likely to structurally impair companies’ earnings. The Edelweiss fund, launched in 2009, has posted a return of 20% (compounded annual growth rate, or CAGR) in the last 5 years, which has helped attract investors looking for better returns in the last one and a half years. The AUM of the Edelweiss fund has jumped from about Rs 152 crore at the start of the pandemic to over Rs 1,800 crore this month. On Friday, Sachin Bansal-backed Navi Mutual Fund too filed for a China-focused FoF with markets regulator Sebi, which would make it the third such mutual fund scheme in India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/wealth/mutual-funds/indians-lap-up-china-focused-mfs/articleshow/86380884.cms||Aseem Gujar
---||Patna||Bihar: Fall in overall crime against women, but rise in rape cases||PATNA: Though Bihar registered 17.3% fall in the cases of crime against women last year compared to 2019, there was 10.4% rise in rape incidents and 87% in cases of assault on women with an intent to outrage her modesty in 2020, according to the the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) figures released recently. As per the report, 806 rape cases were registered in the state in 2020 against 730 in 2019, whereas 110 cases of attempt to commit rape and 584 incidents of assault with intention of outraging modesty were reported last year compared to 69 and 312 cases, respectively, in 2019. However, a total of 15,359 cases of crime against women were reported under the IPC or under the Special and Local Laws (SLL) across the state last year, compared to 18,587 in 2019 and 16,920 in 2018. Crime against women cases include that of rape, outraging modesty, dowry deaths and harassment, acid attacks and kidnapping. With 6,671 incidents of kidnapping of women, Bihar was among the top three states after Uttar Pradesh (9,109) and West Bengal (7,740). Of them, 5,378 were kidnapped on the pretext of marriage, including 2,758 minor girls. As per the NCRB data, 790 victims were raped by known persons, 132 by family members and only 16 by unknown perpetrators of the crime. Law officer (home department) Vivek Kumar Gupta told this newspaper that it is a social problem. “There are many laws for the protection of women but the problem is at the implementation level. Several changes have been made in Section 354 (whoever assaults or uses criminal force on any woman, intending to outrage her modesty) of the IPC, but until the people’s mindset changes, it is not possible to chck such crime,” he said, adding that education is necessary. A city-based psychologist, Dr Binda Singh, said the cases of cruelty on women by husbands or his family members have increased during the Covid-19 lockdown. “Every day, we come across such cases and help the victims fight for their rights. In many cases, I have seen that women are afraid of lodging complaints because of the fear of society, insecurity and inability to make a decision. Even the educated women are not able to raise their voice against the violence due to fear. In many cases, even the family does not support the victim. A 16-year-old girl was abused by her uncle but her mother did not support the victim saying who will earn if they lodged a complaint against the only earning member of the family,” she said. Among the other cases of crime against women, 1,583 were registered under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, of which 628 were rape cases and the remaining of sexual assault and harassment. Bihar has reported the maximum 106 cases out of the 553 across the country in which kids were used for pornography or storing child porn.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/fall-in-overall-crime-against-women-but-rise-in-rape-cases/articleshow/86376816.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Business||‘Central banks must be part of climate fight’||Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has said that central banks need to be part of the fight against climate change. RBI deputy governor M Rajeshwar Rao said on Monday that there are inter-linkages between climate-related risks and financial institutions, and that these risks were ascending the “hierarchy of threats to financial stability” across economies. The RBI has already set up a Sustainable Finance Group (SFG) within the department of regulation. This will spearhead its efforts and regulatory initiatives in the areas of sustainable finance and climate risk. Some initiatives include incorporating climate risks into financial stability monitoring and building in-house capacity to measure climate risks. The RBI is also coordinating with other financial regulators to better understand climate-related risks to the financial system and those related to a transition to a low-carbon economy. In parallel, the Financial Stability Board is working on ways to promote consistent, high-quality climate disclosures in line with the recommendations of the task force. Speaking at the CAFRAL Virtual Conference on Green and Sustainable Finance, Rao said that climate change is possibly the biggest threat facing humanity. “The fight against climate change is certainly a task for the global economy, society, and its institutions — including central banks. Greenhouse gas emissions do not stop at national borders, and international trade accounts for a significant share of global emissions,” Rao said. The deputy governor also encouraged the financial sector to help develop new financial instruments to channelise savings towards green initiatives to make them more sustainable, rewarding, and impactful. Rao said that climate-related financial risks arise not just from climate change events like precipitation, extreme weather variability, ocean acidification and rising temperature, but also from efforts to mitigate these changes. “One such example is investment behaviour. Globally, many investors have already started to move away from firms which generate greater environmental costs or engage in activities that are likely to cause environmental harm, sometimes collectively referred to as ‘high-emitting sectors’. Such a trend may result in loss of funding or increase in financing costs for high-emitting entities, which ultimately generates viability concerns around such entities.” Rao’s comments come at a time when some global banks have committed to reduce their exposure to high-emission sectors such as coal in 10-15 years. Few global reinsurers have also stopped providing support for coal-based power projects. “Mandated climate-related mitigation plans could cause decrease in financial valuation or downgrade of credit ratings for businesses which are violating climate norms,” said Rao. He added that there was a clear benefit in moving early as both climate change and the transition to a carbon-neutral economy have the potential to affect economy and, by extension, general welfare of the people. According to Rao, global issuance of green bonds surpassed $250 billion in 2019 — about 3.5% of total global bond issuance. Projections estimate that global issuance of green bonds is likely to reach $450 billion this year and that there is high possibility of issuance surpassing $1 trillion in 2023.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/central-banks-must-be-part-of-climate-fight/articleshow/86381026.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: 13 lakh jabs needed a day, 1 crore in a week to meet target||BHOPAL: Around 1 crore people have to be vaccinated in the next seven days if the state has to meet its deadline of 100% first-dose coverage. That’s over 13 lakh a day, and given the average daily vaccination rates, it seems a target too far. On Monday, over 6.2 lakh doses were administered – less than half of what’s needed. The state averages around 5-7 lakh shots a day, barring the mega vax days, when it has vaccinated 17 lakh to 24 lakh people. On Sundays, this drops to barely 2.5 lakh. If the target is to be met, the state really has to step up the pace. On September 10, CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan had set September 26 as the deadline for 100% vaccination. When TOI spoke with ACS-health Md Suleman on Monday, he spoke of September 27. As on September 20, 4.54 crore people had been administered at least one dose of the Covid vaccine. The estimated population of Madhya Pradesh in 2021 is above 8 crore, but the population eligible for vaccination is estimated around 5.5 crore, excluding children and those not fit for vaccination. Thus, around 96 lakh people are left to be vaccinated to achieve this target. What further complicates matters, apart from the sheer weight of 13 lakh jabs a day, is that a large chunk of this 5.5 crore population is migratory and is out of the state, said sources. Asked if the administration will meet the deadline, Suleman said, “Vaccination is going on in full swing in the state. We will ensure that every individual who is in the state and is willing to get vaccinated gets at least the first dose by September 27.” Sources said that the government has asked all the districts to prepare a list of all those who are outside Madhya Pradesh to know how many are in the state and left to be vaccinated. Many migrants, whose voter card carried their home district address, have possibly been vaccinated in cities like Indore, Bhopal and Rewa where they work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/13l-jabs-needed-a-day-1-cr-in-a-week-to-meet-target/articleshow/86378601.cms||Amarjeet Singh

Providing details of the same, Prof T Murugeshi, archaeologist, said on Monday that the seven-feet tall stone slab was found near the Venkataramana temple. “The menhir resembles a pregnant woman, but we cannot ascertain if it was built in memory of a deceased pregnant woman. It was found at Basrur, a historically important region,” he said. “‘Basure’ or ‘Basiru’ means pregnant in Kannada and the region was an important city for trade and was known as Basurepattana, Basurepura, Vasupura, Basaruru in the past. There are many temples indicating its splendid wealth. The Devi temple of Basrur has special importance as it is probably the only temple in India where the temple feast is performed once in every 60 years,” said Prof Murugeshi. “The other temples in the region are Mahalingeshwara temple, Venkataramana temple, Kote Anjaneya temple, Tuluveshwara temple, Devi temple, Ramachandra temple, Uma Maheshwara temple, Bhairava temple, Garadi and Sadananda Mutt, a few surviving examples of the place’s glorious past,” he said. The word menhir was adopted from French by 19th-century archaeologists. In India Menhirs are as tall as 20 ft, majestic, monolithic stone slabs often planted in memory of the dead - that is, memorial stones that mark graves of the Megalithic period. Menhirs are dated from 1000 BC to 800 BC, said Prof Murugeshi. “The discovery of a menhir near Venkataramana temple at Basrur has a close similarity to the menhirs found at Baise and Nilskal villages of Shivamogga district,” he added. Basrur Venkataramana Temple trustees Murulidhar Hegde and Pradeep Basrur supported the professor while archaeology students Shreyas, Gowtham, Nagaraj, Karthik, Ganesh and Chandru assisted him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/megalithic-menhir-found-at-basrur/articleshow/86376572.cms||---

The one-time settlement scheme was cleared by the cabinet to benefit more than 56,000 people who have taken a housing loan between 1983 and 2011. The government has agreed to clear their loans with a one-time payment and given three slabs for beneficiaries in urban and rural areas. The chief minister on Monday reviewed the scheme and directed officials to start implementation. The scheme was renamed Jagananna Saswatha Gruha Hakku Padhakam (Permanent Housing Rights). He directed the Corporation to upload data from September 25 and share it with the secretariats. Officials told the chief minister there would be an option to pay the OTS at village and ward secretariats. Once the details of those eligible for OTS are finalised in the secretariats, house and land registrations will be done after the payment of the prescribed amount, officials said. — Gopi Dara||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/one-time-settlement-to-be-implemented-in-sectts/articleshow/86378150.cms||Gopi Dara
---||Business||Paytm, HDFC Bk tie up for credit cards||TNN Mumbai: Paytm will start issuing a range of HDFC Bank co-branded Visa credit cards to its customers. The new cards will be customised to target specific segments such as millennials, business owners and merchants. A joint statement issued by the two said that the card will be targeted at first-time credit card users as well as affluent customers. The launch is planned in October — ahead of the festive season — to tap into a potentially higher consumer demand for credit card offers, EMIs and ‘buy now, pay later’ options. The partners plan to offer the entire suite of products by the end of December. IPO-bound Paytm is looking to scale up its business, while HDFC Bank is making up for lost time following an eight-month embargo by the regulator on issuing new cards after its IT systems experienced downtime. HDFC Bank has said that one strategy for growing cards would be a partnership. Earlier, HDFC Bank had announced a partnership with Paytm for merchant acquisition. The idea was to enable more merchants to accept digital payments. Paytm had earlier partnered with Citibank for credit card issuance. Citi has, however, announced that India would be one of the markets where it would exit from retail. The partnership is another big win for Visa, which has also gained from the ban on new card issuances on the Mastercard network following data-localisation norms. On Monday, Yes Bank, which had an exclusive deal with Mastercard earlier, said it has started issuing Visa cards. The statement said that the alliance will target deeper penetration in tier-2 and -3 markets using Paytm’s digital prowess and reach of over 330 million consumers. The ‘business’ credit cards would mark Paytm’s foray into the credit card segment for merchants, benefiting its base of more than 21 million merchants. Retailers can use this credit card for their business. The partners also introduced an entire range of consumer credit cards, offering cashbacks and benefits, including the ‘mobile’ credit card targeted at digital-first millennials. Users can apply through a digital and paperless process and complete the on-boarding process fully through the Paytm app.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/paytm-hdfc-bk-tie-up-for-credit-cards/articleshow/86379366.cms||---

Gokul has named them Chinnu and Minnu and they arrive at his house for food every morning. “They came eight months back and were found walking along with turkey chicks in our house. The mother turkey raised both the peahen chicks. Once they grew up, they went to the nearby rubber plantation. However, they come home daily to have food. After that, they spend time in the house and fly back in the evening,” said Gokul. Gokul’s mother Geetha said that the peahens first arrived at their home during the Covid lockdown and the boy used to spend a lot of time with the birds. “The arrival of the birds ended the boredom of Gokul. We found the peahens in the turkey flock we have at our house. We started feeding them along with the turkey birds. Everyone thought that once they grow a little bit they would fly away. But it did not happen. My son has seen them growing up and always fed them. It may be the reason that they arrive each day by around 6am and even play with him,” she said. The neighbours are also amazed by the unusual bond between the peahens and the boy. When anyone else approaches the birds, they fly away but are comfortable with Gokul. “They do fly around the neighbourhood houses. But they eat food when the boy gives them. Every morning they reach the house from the rubber plantation nearby. If the door is closed, they will knock on it with their beaks and make sound by fluttering their wings,” said Narayanan a neighbour. The favourite food items of Chinnu and Minnu are mashed bananas and the feed given to chicken. Since Gokul’s father Sudhakaran rears cattle, pigs and turkey, the food for the peahens is always available in the house. agencies||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/peahens-find-a-friend-in-this-class-x-student-from-kannur/articleshow/86380859.cms||---

At present, the water board supplies about 509 mgd to consumers within Greater Hyderabad and its periphery, even as the total demand here stands at 609 mgd. The plan to increase the daily supply is aimed at bridging this gap partially. “While the water board has independent power to increase the quantity to meet the demand, it is mandatory to take a final clearance from higher-ups in the government,” said a HMWS&SB official. A final decision on the matter is expected in a week or so.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/water-supplyto-city-may-go-up-by-50-mgd/articleshow/86380796.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: YSRC sets sights on zilla parishad chairperson polls||AMARAVATI: After making a clean sweep in the ZPTC and MPTC elections, the YSRC has now shifted its focus to the finalisation of candidates for zilla parishad chairperson elections to be held on September 25. Though chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy has in principle cleared the candidates for the top post in the ZPs, an official declaration is expected in a day or two. Sources said the party is most likely to stick to the initial selection except in Kurnool district. In accordance with the chief minister’s women empowerment policy, seven of the 13 ZP chief candidates are women. YSRC ZP chief candidate in Kurnool, Yerabothula Venkata Reddy, died before the results were declared. The election for Kolimigundla ZPTC was suspended following his death. Sources said the chief minister has directed district leaders to spare the post for Venkata Reddy’s son Uday Kumar Reddy. Since Uday Kumar Reddy will have to contest a by-election, the party is contemplating installing an interim chairman till his election to the ZPTC. As many as five proposed ZP chairperson candidates including Buchepalli Venkayamma (Prakasam), Anam Arunamma (Nellore), Akepati Amarnath Reddy (Kadapa), Majji Srinivasa Rao (Vizianagaram), and M V Subbareddy (Kurnool) were unanimously elected as ZPTC members. Sources said M V Subbareddy will be elected as chairman during the election on Saturday. He, however, would be asked to hand over the baton to Uday Kumar Reddy after the by-election to Kolimigundla ZPTC. Similarly, Periya Vijaya is most likely to take over the reins as Srikakulam ZP chairperson. K Siva Rathnam who got elected from GK Veedhi ZPTC, is likely to be elected Visakhapatnam ZP chief. While V Venugopala Rao will become East Godavari ZP chief, K Srinivas will be chairman in West Godavari. The party has decided to grant the Krishna ZP chief post to Uppla Harika. Similarly, the Guntur ZP chief post is going to Kattera Henri Christina. Anantapur district too will be getting a woman ZP chief as the party has decided to field Girija as candidate. While the party has almost finalised the name of Srinivasulu of V Kota mandal for Chittoor ZP chief post, a strong follower of panchayat raj minister Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy is believed to be making a last minute pitch for the post with the leadership. Meanwhile, the chief minister held discussions with senior leaders and cabinet ministers on Monday to stamp his final approval to the list of ZP chief candidates. Sources said the chief minister directed district in-charge ministers to hold discussions with legislators and party in-charges to select mandal parishad chairperson candidates. The chief minister, who is particular about maintaining a 50% quota to the SC, ST, BC and minority communities in all posts, has directed legislators to include as many women as mandal parishad chairpersons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ysrc-sets-sights-on-zp-chairperson-polls/articleshow/86378208.cms||Samdani MN

An expert committee has been set up to prepare a module for the bridge course that will bring students up to speed. TimesViewThis is critical. A huge percentage of students, across classes and age groups, would be facing this problem; it would be even more acute for students appearing for board and/or semester exams in both schools and colleges. This problem should get the attention it deserves.The government plans to start with classes IX to XII so that those appearing for the boards are better prepared. The committee members have started meeting teachers from different parts. “A student who was in class VII in March 2020 will be in class IX in January 2022. A proper programme is required to help them bridge the learning gap,” said a school education department official. Under the course, sources said key concepts that were taught in classes VII and VIII would again be taught to IX students. Class X students will be taught concepts from classes VIII and IX. These lessons will precede teaching of the actual syllabuses for IX and X. A similar exercise will be carried out for XI and XII. While Madhyamik and HS schools in Kolkata and other major towns could hold online classes, those in smaller towns and villages in Bengal have not had any class since March 2020 due to the digital divide. “There have been very few programmes, like online classes, phone conversations and activity tasks, in government and government-aided schools. Many have missed crucial portions or have not understood concepts properly but have been promoted. This is an attempt to help bridge that gap in learning,” the official explained.' Kailash Vidyamandir headmaster Biswajit Mitra said, “The programme to fill the gap is crucial for students. But what about the teachers have also been out of the process for the past year and a half and need to be re-trained?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/govt-plans-spl-course-to-bridge-learning-gap-at-state-schools/articleshow/86379392.cms||---

In a letter to Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur said the state government has taken a decision to use ropeways for transportation of passengers and goods throughout the state, as in some places construction of roads is not environmentally and economically feasible. It also aims to explore new tourism opportunities. Yet another objective is to provide first and last mile connectivity according to the requirement of the state. CM Thakur said the Himachal government has created ropeways and rapid transportation system development corporation (RTDC) under the transport department as a single nodal agency for construction of ropeways and other mass rapid transportation systems. He also added that the ropeways and other unconventional modes of transportation are not defined separately under specific entry of GST schedules. The GST is being levied on this service (9% SGST and 9% CGST) or 18% IGST, increasing the freight on this mode of transportation substantially. The CM further mentioned that Himachal is one of the revenue deficit states where the revenue gap is more than 50%. The setting of ropeways would attract a large number of the tourists to the state, which in turn would help in economic growth and enhancing the revenue receipt of the state. Additional chief secretary, excise and tax department, who attended the recently held meeting of the GST Council at Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh said the discussion was held in the meeting to reduce the GST rate from existing 18%. He said on the request of the state, the GST Council sent the matter to the fitment committee to re-consider the proposal in consultation with the states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/hp-pushes-for-5-gst-from-18-on-ropeways/articleshow/86380803.cms||Anand Bodh

The double lung transplant will be carried out on a man in his early 40s, who has been on ECMO for 106 days due to Covid. The flight carrying the lungs from Surat landed in Kolkata at 10.10pm and the organ was immediately ferried to Medica Superspecialty Hospital. A source at Medica said the patient, who worked at an IT major, was hospitalized with Covid. The ECMO team suggested a transplant as his lungs were completely damaged. Around the same time, a man was declared brain dead in a Surat hospital but no match was found for his organs in Gujarat. NOTTO, eastern zone found it matched the Medica patient and allocated it to him. An ECMO team from Medica went to the Surat hospital to retrieve and harvest the organ. Even as they flew back with the lung, another team here prepared for the transplant. The surgery started around 10.30pm and the transplant team was still on the job till last report came in. “For about a year, our lung transplant team has been preparing to take up the surgery as and when the occasion demanded. We hope all goes well,” said Medica Group chairman Alok Roy. IPGMER is the first hospital in Bengal to get a lung transplant licence. Doctors said lung transplant was a complicated procedure, more complex than that of heart, kidney or liver. “I am happy about this development in organ donation and transplant in Bengal,” said Kolkata resident Rupayan Roy, who underwent heart transplant five years ago. Back then, Kolkata had no heart transplant facility. “Our flight from Kolkata to Chennia via Hyderabad two days ago had a heart being flown to Chennai from Hyderabad. And now, this first lung transplant is being held here,” said Roy, now holidaying in Puducherry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kols-1st-lung-transplant-to-give-cov-patient-new-life/articleshow/86378982.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

PU would hold induction programmes before starting formal classes to apprise the students with the rules and regulations and also the facilities available on the campus. Classes would start well before the commencement of Durga Puja holidays, he said. There are altogether 4000 seats for undergraduate students in different colleges of PU.  As many as 652 students out of 2500 admitted so far have opted for upgradation (revision) of their choice of subjects or institutions. Their list would be included in the second allotment of subjects and institutions to be announced on September 21. Referring to the demand of some student organisations regarding reservation of seats in undergraduate courses for students passing class XII examination from the Bihar School Examination Board (BSEB), the VC said such provision does not exist in the PU admission ordinances.

The second-dose lag is increasing quite rapidly as it was 42 lakh on September 4 and has since gone up by almost 25%. Between September 5 and September 19, over 35.6 lakh second doses were administered but that still left more than 6 lakh doses due from the previous pile. To add to it, nearly 46.5 lakh people who took their first shots from June 11-25 became eligible for their second doses in the past fortnight. Taken together, it adds up to a lag of over 52 lakh. But for the 12.4 people who took their second shots during the mega drive on September 17, the backlog would be much bigger. Sources said that the state government is now focusing on 100% coverage of first dose by September 26. “We want to give the entire eligible population protection from Covid. Yes, the second-dose overdue numbers are mounting, but once the first-dose coverage is achieved, it’s only a matter of time before the second doses are covered,” said an official. Once first dose target is covered, officials will draw up ward-wise lists to identify those who have skipped their second dose, said sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/52-lakh-2nd-dose-backlog-weighs-heavy-on-vax-drive/articleshow/86378568.cms||Amarjeet Singh

As per the statistics available with the district vector-borne disease control programme (DVBDCP) cell, Dakshina Kannada has reported 190 cases of dengue in 2021 as on date. Compared to 2019 and 2020, the number of cases is less this year. The district had recorded 1,539 cases in 2019 and 239 in 2020. While the district recorded one dengue death in 2018, four in 2019 and two in 2020, no fatalities have been reported in 2021 so far. District surveillance officer and DVBDCP officer Dr Naveenchandra Kulal told TOI that cases in all taluks, except Bantwal, were less than 50 this year. “Of the 190 cases reported in Dakshina Kannada, 51 were in Bantwal taluk followed by 38 in Mangaluru, 30 in Puttur, 27 in Sullia, 25 in Mangaluru city and 19 cases in Belthangady taluk. Majority of the cases were reported in June, July and August this year. Right now, the situation in DK is under control but that does not mean that cases will not rise later. Hence, we are fully prepared to prevent the spread of dengue,” he said. “After Covid-19 pandemic, people are more health conscious and have been following guidelines on the prevention of mosquito breeding. We have been obtaining data of suspected and confirmed cases of dengue from all laboratories and hospitals in the district for analysis.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Six labourers held for molesting woman, thrashing neighbours||KOLKATA: At least two persons were severely injured while protesting the molestation and harassment of a woman near her home by a group of construction workers affiliated to a New Town syndicate on Sunday night. While one of the protesters, a 59-year-old PWD engineer, received five stitches on his head, a 45-year-old suffered severe injuries to his legs. Both were taken to a local hospital and returned home in the early hours of Monday. They are currently on bed rest. Police have arrested six persons identified by the woman and the protesters as part of the gang that attacked them. “This is hooliganism at its worst. This is not what the law and order should be in a smart city like New Town — women here cannot walk alone at night and any protest is dealt with vicious attacks. I have been living in New Town for seven years, but something like this has happened to me for the first time,” said Debabrata Ranu, who was hit with a plastic chair. According to the complainant, a 35-year-old businesswoman who stays as a paying guest in New Town’s BC Block, the incident happened around 8.20pm when she was walking home along street 165 after getting off an auto at Narkelbagan crossing. “While I was crossing an under-construction building, some labourers passed a remark and one said he wants to hold me. I didn’t stop then, but after crossing the road, I found a group of middle-aged and elderly men outside a building. I told them about it and they instantly accompanied me back to the place,” said the woman. On being confronted, the labourers denied having harassed her and got into an argument with the elderly men. When one of the labourers was slapped, they made some calls and, within moments, a group of men arrived in a car and multiple bikes and pounced on the elderly men. The woman started recording the events on her mobile. “We were outnumbered. There were no cops despite repeated calls and we began to run back. The men chased us and, as we reached our compound, they began kicking and punching us. I was surrounded by four men who tried to hit me with a chair when Debu da (Ranu) shielded me and got injured. He started bleeding from the head as the men retreated, warning us not to mess with them again,” said Arindam Ray (45), a regional manager with a private firm. A cop team reached the spot after a while, raided the construction site and picked up four men. Later in the morning, two other men were picked up. A senior officer said more arrests will follow. “I am thankful to the senior neighbours who stood up for me and ended up paying a hefty price. But I will not back off. I remember the face of each tormentor who teased me and assaulted the elderly men,” said the woman. Meanwhile, a New Town residents’ association has vowed to take the issue forward and organise a protest march and demonstration at the incident spot on Tuesday evening.

---||Business||Lenders seek to scrap sale of Videocon, move NCLAT||TNN Mumbai: Vedanta’s winning bid to acquire Videocon’s assets through its company Twin Star Technologies is likely to fall through with lenders approaching the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), seeking fresh bids for the firm. In an unusual turn of events, the committee of creditors has decided to go back on their earlier approval for a bid after their acceptance turned controversial because it was very close to the liquidation value. Even as the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) approved the proposal, it had castigated lenders for the deal because of which the applicant was paying “next to nothing”. The court was also surprised that Twin Star’s valuation of the 13 companies of the Videocon Group was almost identical to the registered valuers’. The deal was stalled after the Bank of Maharashtra, a dissenting creditor, approached the NCLAT. In a parallel development, the government, through the corporate affairs ministry, had moved the NCLT to act against Videocon under Section 241-242 of the Companies Act. Following this petition, the tribunal directed the Indian Banks Association, depositories and the income tax authorities to freeze all assets of promoters and senior management of Videocon Group. Anil Agarwal’s Twin Star Technologies had bid Rs 2,962 crore to acquire the Videocon Group companies, which was just over 4% of the admitted claims of Rs 64,838 crore. The application for a re-bid was made by SBI, the lead bankers to the bankrupt group. SBI represented assenting creditors of Videocon, who accounted for nearly 95% of the debt. The two-member NCLAT bench headed by Justice Jarat Kumar Jain and member Kanthi Narahari, posted the matter for further hearings on September 27.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/lenders-seek-to-scrap-sale-of-videocon-move-nclat/articleshow/86379591.cms||---

He is all set to get discharged on Tuesday, four days after the surgery was performed. The hospital’s department of cardiothoracic and vascular surgery (CTVS) started performing heart surgeries with no chest bone cuts or incisions over leg in 2014. "Since 2014, numerous valve replacement and congenital birth defect surgeries have been performed through thoracotomy, a surgical procedure wherein a cut is made between the ribs to reach out to the heart," said Dr Anil Sharma, a senior professor at the CTVS department of the medical college and hospital. "However, performing a heart bypass using this technique was a challenge. The total arterial bypass is gold standard for coronary artery blockage. Bypass is done using internal thoracic artery and radial artery most of the times. Using chest artery for bypass weakens bone and delays healing of cut bone," he explained. Dr Anil Sharma and his team conducted their first and second left internal mammary artery (LIMA) radial bypass grafting through thoracotomy within 10 days. "Patients recovered well after surgery and one of them was sent home in three days. In the past 10 days, the SMS hospital’s CTVS surgeons have performed several such surgeries." he said. Talking about the benefits of the technique, Dr Sharma said since the technique did not involve a bone crack, patient did not experience pain and chances of infection were rare. He said patients stayed in Intensive care unit (ICU) for less duration, there was less blood loss and the recovery was fast. He added that the surgery was cost-effective and cosmetically acceptable to most patients, especially females.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/nigerians-heart-valve-fixed-without-bone-pierce-at-sms/articleshow/86380805.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Puja gift: Epar Bangla to get hilsa from Opar Bangla||Kolkata: The Sheikh Hasina government in Bangladesh on Monday allowed export of over 2,000 tonnes of hilsa to Bengal, the highest in a decade. The first shipment of around 20 tonnes from Padma-Meghna rivers is expected to reach the markets either on Tuesday or Wednesday. The supply is also expected to bring down hilsa prices that have gone through the roof this year due to the poor catch in Indian waters. The Bangladesh commerce ministry on Monday granted approval to 52 companies to export 40 tonnes of hilsa each to Bengal citing Durga Puja. “Bangladeshi firms have been granted permission to export 2,080 tonnes of hilsa to Bengal. The consignments will be dispatched from early Tuesday and should reach Kolkata late on Tuesday or early on Wednesday,” said Kazi Abdul Mannan, MD, Seven Star Fish Processing Co Ltd, one of the largest fish exporters in Bangladesh. He has four licences and will be exporting 160 tonnes. While customers are sure to be happy, fish exporters and importers are battling a logistic challenge: the transaction must be completed within October 10. With three Sundays and three Fridays (Bangladeshi holiday) within this period when consignments get held up at the border, Bangladeshi exporters and Indian importers will effectively have 14 days for the transaction. State fisheries minister Akhil Giri said he had heard about Bangladesh allowing export, but was yet to be officially intimated by the Indian government. West Bengal Fish Importers’ Association secretary Syed Anwar Maqsood said the increase in export allotment from 1,450 tonnes in 2020 to 2,080 tonnes now is a good omen and he hopes the Sheikh Hasina government will eventually lift the ban. Maqsood said the imported fish would weigh between 800g and 2kg, with those weighing up to 1kg expected to be priced at Rs 1,600-Rs 1,700 per kg and those weighing more to sell for Rs 1,800-Rs 2,000 per kg.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/puja-gift-epar-bangla-to-get-hilsa-from-opar-bangla/articleshow/86379339.cms||Monotosh Chakraborty

The project was inaugurated by the UT adviser Dharam Pal. Virat, additional inspector general (AIG)-cum-superintendent, who played major role in the project said the kutirs have been named after eminent personalities in Indian history, including freedom fighters and saints. He said this is an attempt to bring about a positive change in the mindset of prisoners and inspire inmates. The UT prisons department, in association with Government College of Arts, prepared sculptures, which have been installed outside 20 barracks (14 male and six female) and other buildings inside Model Burail Jail. Virat said that the primary objective of punishment is to cause reformation in the wrongdoer. The department of prisons and correctional administration plays the most important role in the lives of persons who stay there as convicts or undertrials, he said, adding that an inmate is heavily influenced by the environment. Over a period of time, the prison environment creates a lasting impression and has a consequential effect on the psyche of an inmate long after he/she leaves the prison, he said. A brief history of these great personalities have also been engraved on a plaque outside every kutir, which highlights their contribution to Indian history.

---||Patna||Health minister Mangal Pandey stresses on creating filariasis-free state||PATNA/KATIHAR: Health minister, Mangal Pandey, laid stress on the use of anti-filarial drugs and the need to create awareness about them during the official launch of a mass drug administration (MDA) for elimination of filariasis on Monday. Talking about the role of community participation, the minister said, “Let us eliminate this disease together and create a healthy, filariasis-free Bihar.” He also asked the frontline workers to motivate at least one person from every house to become a volunteer and raise awareness about the anti-filarial drugs in society. In Phase I, the MDA will be conducted in 22 districts, including Araria, Banka, Begusarai, Bhagalpur, Buxar, East Champaran, West Champaran, Gopalganj, Jehanabad, Jamui, Kaimur, Katihar, Khagaria, Madhepura, Munger, Muzaffarpur, Patna, Saharsa, Saran, Sitamarhi, Siwan, and Supaul. It is expected to cover 7 crore beneficiaries during the phase. Filariasis is a parasitic infection caused by worms that are transmitted by mosquitoes. Usually acquired in childhood, it impairs the lymphatic system and can lead to abnormal enlargement of body parts. A few people also develop chronic cough called tropical pulmonary eosinophilia and can have symptoms like passing of milky white urine. They also face stigma and discrimination due to severe disability and disfiguration that are irreversible, if not treated early. The director in chief of disease control and public health, Dr Navin Chandra Prasad, told TOI, “During the MDA, a combination of two drugs, Diethylcarbamazine and Albendazole, will be administered to the eligible population in affected areas to interrupt transmission of the disease. Children below 2 years, pregnant women, and seriously ill people will, however, be excluded.” The executive director of the State Health Society, Dr Sanjay Kumar Singh, pointed out that Albendazole also treated worm diseases in children, “which directly helps in their physical and intellectual development”. Lauding the state government’s efforts to eradicate filariasis, Dr Nupur Roy, the additional director of the National Vector Borne Disease (VBD) Control Programme, claimed that the goal of elimination was not too far. At a similar programme in Katihar, civil surgeon, Dr D N Pandey, said, “Taking medicines is mandatory for patients suffering from filariasis otherwise it can cripple them.” Dr Jai Prakash Singh, the district VBD control officer, stated that Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and B timori were the three parasitic worms that infected people and caused lymphatic filariasis. Sharing district-level data, Prabeen Kumar Thakur, the district coordinator of Project Concern International, said, “Altogether 1,683 drug administrators have been roped in to distribute medicines among the patients. The drugs will also be available at 344 health sub-centres in Katihar.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/health-minister-stresses-on-creating-filariasis-free-state/articleshow/86375190.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Business||Contagion fear grips global markets over China’s debt crisis||MUMBAI: Indian markets closed sharply lower on Monday with the sensex down 525 points at 58,491, weighed by a global selloff that had its origins in a loan default by China’s largest real estate developer Evergrande, in which investors from across the world hold bonds. Analysts said that even the second-largest real estate company in China is in trouble with mounting debt, and the joint impact of the two entities now threatens the already fragile global recovery. On Monday, trading on Dalal Street started on a weak note with the sensex down nearly 400 points. It recovered and was in the green by noon. But after that, it lost ground steadily to close nearly 1% lower. The day’s 525-point loss in the index was the biggest single-session drop in two months, BSE data showed. On the NSE, the Nifty too traversed a similar trajectory and closed 188 points lower at 17,397. Commodity and metal stocks were the worst hit. The day’s slide on the BSE left investors poorer by Rs 3.4 lakh crore with its market capitalisation now at Rs 257.7 lakh crore, official data showed. According to a report by the US-based investment management major Invesco, Evergrande’s liabilities are around 6.5% of the total Chinese property market’s liabilities and about 9% of the total Chinese offshore bond market financing. “Since the company is currently considered the bellwether for the property market and also a gauge of investor’s risk appetite for the broader offshore market, it’s fair to assume that there could be some systemic risk to the market if the ordeal is left unmitigated,” it said in a report published on Monday. Coming within two years of the Covid-pandemic led panic selling that was witnessed in early 2020, investors are taking a cautious stance and offloading their positions in case the debt crisis in China engulfs the global market. As a result, in mid-session in the US, the Dow Jones index was down over 2%, while the Nasdaq was 2.6% lower. Crude oil too had slipped by over 2% and copper futures (December delivery) in Chicago was down nearly 3%. Back home, the slide in the sensex was led by HDFC and HDFC Bank, along with Tata Steel. These three stocks together accounted for more than 60% of the day’s loss in the sensex, BSE data showed. On the other hand, buying in FMCG stocks, along with Reliance Industries, cushioned the fall to some extent. Brokers also pointed out that while domestic funds were aggressive sellers with a net outflow of Rs 1,627 crore, foreign investors were still net buyers at Rs 93 crore.The weakness in metal and commodity stocks pulled down the BSE metal index by nearly 7%, while the basic materials index closed more than 4% down.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/contagion-fear-grips-global-mkts-over-chinas-debt-crisis/articleshow/86380790.cms||---

The man, identified as Dasrath Manjhi, was rescued by the police after facing stiff resistance from the local residents. Mahnar police station SHO Manoj Kumar admitted Manjhi to the sub-divisional hospital. Sources said the bicycle and the schoolbag belonging to the deceased were recovered from a water-filled agricultural land after interrogating Manjhi. “He is being interrogated,” the SHO said. Meanwhile, a delegation of the Bhumihar Brahman Samajik Front submitted a memorandum to IG (Tirhut range) Ganesh Kumar on Monday, seeking his intervention in the schoolgirl’s murder case. Two former ministers — Suresh Sharma and Ajit Kumar — who were part of the delegation, later told the media that they would intensify their agitation if justice was not delivered to the girl’s family and the accused were not arrested at the earliest.

---||Patna||Woman killed husband due to illicit relation with his business partner: Muzaffarpur SSP||PATNA: The Muzaffarpur police are on the lookout for one Radha Devi who allegedly killed her husband, Rakesh Kumar, with the help of her paramour, Subhash Kumar. Cut into pieces and stuffed in a plastic container, the body of the 30-year-old youth was recovered from a flat at Balughat under the Town police station area on Saturday. “Preliminary investigation has revealed that Radha’s illicit relationship with Rakesh’s business partner, Subhash, was one of the reasons behind the murder,” Muzaffarpur SSP, Jayant Kant, said on Monday, adding that a knife, a hammer and a half-filled packet of bleaching power were also recovered from the flat. The SSP also pointed out, “A Forensic Science Laboratory team had collected evidence from the spot on Sunday. Its report is awaited.” According to police, Radha and Subhash strangled Rakesh to death after offering him drinks laced with a sedative. The SHO of Sikandarpur police outpost, Harendra Kumar, said four people, including Radha, her sister, brother-in-law, and paramour, had been named as accused in the FIR lodged on the statement of Rakesh’s brother, Dinesh Sahni. Dinesh told the investigators that Radha misled his wife when she went to the Balughat residence of Rakesh to inquire about him about six days ago. She claimed that Rakesh had gone out for some business-related work. He was, however, killed on Saturday night. Later, evidences related to the use of urea, sulphuric acid, and salt to decompose his body were found. “The post-mortem report revealed that the victim was killed five days before the recovery of his body. The windows were shut and the room was locked from outside,” an investigating officer claimed. During investigation, it came to light that Radha had been living in a rented flat after Rakesh shifted to Delhi due to police pressure in a case related to violation of the prohibition law. However, she called him on the eve of Teej and killed him subsequently. Earlier, Rakesh was sent to jail thrice in prohibition-related cases lodged with the Town police station and the Sikandarpur police outpost.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/woman-killed-hubby-due-to-illicit-relation-with-his-biz-partner-ssp/articleshow/86376897.cms||Ramashankar
---||Kolkata||City collector’s show features rare Afghan notes||Kolkata: A city notaphilist has brought out demonetised Afghan currency for a virtual exhibition. Among the notes on display are ones that were discontinued in 2001 after the Taliban regime ended in Afghanistan. The notes — of 5,000 and 10,000 denominations — are considered extremely rare by collectors since they had been wiped out of circulation. Anindya Kar has also displayed several rare Afghan Afghani notes from different periods of history in the country. “These were discontinued by the now ousted government the moment they had come to power because it was believed these had funded the Al Qaeda movement. These notes were favourites of the Taliban from 1995 to 2001, not only because they were big denominations, but also since there were no human figures on them, which they highly disapproved of,” Kar said. On display is a 500 Afghan Afghani note that shows the Buzkhasi game on one side and Bala Hissar, the citadel of Kabul, on the other. This note was introduced in Afghanistan in 1978 and was severely criticised by the Taliban. “The game was touted to be immoral by the Taliban then,” Kar said. A 5,000 note shows the Ahmed Shah Durani mausoleum and a 1,000 note shows the shrine of Hazrat Ali. The 10,000 Afghan Afghani on display was issued in 1993 and was among the last batches the then government issued before its ouster by the Taliban. It is green with shades of blue and pink and features the gateway of Qala-e-bost. “The tag on them of being used to fund a terrorist outfit left the regime uncomfortable when it returned in 2001. Countries like the US, the UK, Africa, Bosnia, Egypt, Indonesia, Philippines and Somalia had all reeled under the Al Qaeda attacks and blamed the funding on these notes,” Kar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-collectors-show-features-rare-afghan-notes/articleshow/86379815.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

The minister said the foot overbridge will enable pedestrians to cross the busy Atal Path. “The elevators will help people with disabilities, senior citizens and women with small kids to cross the road. It the first FOB with elevator facility in the city,” he said and added: “Now, the residents of Mahesh Nagar will be able to easily travel on foot to Patliputra Colony and Boring Road.” Nabin said a generator is also there for the lift in case of power cuts. “Atal Path is a world-class road. It has been constructed like an expressway for hassle-free traffic. In such a situation, the FOB was much required for pedestrians as the traffic move fast on this road,” he said. The minister said the 53.315x4.6m facility has been built at a cost of Rs3.44 crore. “Three more similar FOBs will come up at Atal Path near Rajiv Nagar, Kurji Nullah and Punaichak. These FOBs will be ready by December 2021. The Bihar State Road Development Corporation Ltd (BSRDCL) will be responsible for the maintenance of the FOBs,” Nabin said. He also appealed to the citizens to cross the road through the FOB for their own safety. BJP MLA Sanjeev Chaurasia was the special guest on the occasion.

---||Ajmer||Rajasthan health department gears up to tackle dengue challenge||JAIPUR: A day after the Union health ministry alerted Rajasthan on the emerging challenge of Serotype-II Dengue, which is linked to more cases and complications than other forms of the disease, the state’s health department has stepped up its measures tackle the situation. A senior health department official said they were taking measures for early detection of cases and preventing breeding of mosquitoes, however, they have intensified their measures now. "Our department had written to all district collectors to start fogging and prevent mosquito breeding in the state. Several areas with stagnant water have turned into breeding ground for mosquitoes post rains. These need to be destroyed," said the official. Dengue is caused by the DENV virus, which has four different infectious serotypes, including DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4. According to experts, recovery from an infection due to a certain serotype is believed to provide lifelong immunity against that serotype. However, cross-immunity to the other serotypes after recovery is only partial, and temporary. The official said that if a person got infected with one serotype, but later got infected with another serotype of the virus, there were higher chances of developing severe dengue. Hence, it was necessary to prevent its outbreak by preventing breeding of mosquitoes, which transmit the dengue virus from an infected person to a healthy individual, the official added. Officials said people should also play their role in preventing breeding of mosquitoes in their houses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ajmer/state-health-dept-gears-up-to-tackle-dengue-challenge/articleshow/86389360.cms||---

---||Business||Greenko takes Climate Pledge, joins 200 cos||Mumbai: Greenko, a leading renewable energy company, has become a signatory to ‘The Climate Pledge’. It joins more than 200 companies who have pledged to achieve net-zero carbon by 2040. The announcement comes in response to the findings of the latest report from the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which underscores the need for increased urgency in addressing the climate crisis. Experts have pointed out that unless there are immediate, rapid and large-scale reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, limiting warming to close to 1.5 or even 2 degrees Celsius will be out of reach. The Climate Pledge’s current signatories are expected to collectively mitigate 1.98 billion metric tons (BMT) of carbon emissions from a 2020 baseline, representing 5.4% of global annual emissions. This demonstrates the collective impact The Climate Pledge is having in addressing climate change and prompting more action to tackle the global crisis. Greenko Group’s founder, CEO and MD Anil Kumar Chalamalasetty said, “As a leading renewable energy company with an operational portfolio of 7.5GW and a pipeline of 15GW of wind, solar, hydro and energy storage assets spread across 15 states in India, Greenko is proud to be joining The Climate Pledge and making the commitment to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2040 — 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement. Greenko will continue to build upon its hallmark of environmental stewardship through greenhouse gas mitigation, climate risk management, conservation and restoration of habitats, as well as circular economic approaches.” Businesses have long contributed to the effects of climate change, but deep cuts in emissions of greenhouse gases could stabilise increasing temperatures. A statement by Greenko Group said this is why urgent, ambitious action by companies around the world is needed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/greenko-takes-climate-pledge-joins-200-cos/articleshow/86381065.cms||---

Though chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy has in principle cleared the candidates for the top post in the ZPs, an official declaration is expected in a day or two. Sources said the party is most likely to stick to the initial selection except in Kurnool district. In accordance with the chief minister’s women empowerment policy, seven of the 13 ZP chief candidates are women. YSRC ZP chief candidate in Kurnool, Yerabothula Venkata Reddy, died before the results were declared. The election for Kolimigundla ZPTC was suspended following his death. Sources said the chief minister has directed district leaders to spare the post for Venkata Reddy’s son Uday Kumar Reddy. Since Uday Kumar Reddy will have to contest a by-election, the party is contemplating installing an interim chairman till his election to the ZPTC. As many as five proposed ZP chairperson candidates including Buchepalli Venkayamma (Prakasam), Anam Arunamma (Nellore), Akepati Amarnath Reddy (Kadapa), Majji Srinivasa Rao (Vizianagaram), and M V Subbareddy (Kurnool) were unanimously elected as ZPTC members. Sources said M V Subbareddy will be elected as chairman during the election on Saturday. He, however, would be asked to hand over the baton to Uday Kumar Reddy after the by-election to Kolimigundla ZPTC. Similarly, Periya Vijaya is most likely to take over the reins as Srikakulam ZP chairperson. K Siva Rathnam who got elected from GK Veedhi ZPTC, is likely to be elected Visakhapatnam ZP chief. While V Venugopala Rao will become East Godavari ZP chief, K Srinivas will be chairman in West Godavari. The party has decided to grant the Krishna ZP chief post to Uppla Harika. Similarly, the Guntur ZP chief post is going to Kattera Henri Christina. Anantapur district too will be getting a woman ZP chief as the party has decided to field Girija as candidate. While the party has almost finalised the name of Srinivasulu of V Kota mandal for Chittoor ZP chief post, a strong follower of panchayat raj minister Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy is believed to be making a last minute pitch for the post with the leadership. Meanwhile, the chief minister held discussions with senior leaders and cabinet ministers on Monday to stamp his final approval to the list of ZP chief candidates. Sources said the chief minister directed district in-charge ministers to hold discussions with legislators and party in-charges to select mandal parishad chairperson candidates. The chief minister, who is particular about maintaining a 50% quota to the SC, ST, BC and minority communities in all posts, has directed legislators to include as many women as mandal parishad chairpersons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/ysrc-sets-sights-on-zp-chairperson-polls/articleshow/86389840.cms||Samdani MN

The commission had got the three complaints against the hospitals. “The three complaints were mainly of communication gap or miscommunication. We have ordered the hospital to pay Rs 2 lakh each to the families of the two deceased, while Rs 1-lakh compensation to the third patient,” said justice (retired) Ashim Kumar Banerjee, chairperson WBCERC. The health panel also asked Medica Hospital to deposit Rs 4 lakh to the commission after a family complained that their relative died when his oxygen connection was removed while being transferred out of the ambulance. The hospital, however, told the commission that the patient was brought dead. During the hearing, the commission asked the hospital to produce CCTV footage but the authorities claimed they could not retrieve the old recording. “The CCTV footage would have been significant in finding evidence. But as the hospital failed to produce it, we have asked it to deposit Rs 4 lakh,” said Banerjee. The panel asked a few other hospitals to refund treatment fund after complaints were filed against them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/panel-asks-hosp-to-pay-patient-families/articleshow/86379784.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

The chief minister said the victory has given him greater responsibilities to serve the people. The victory has also given him the strength to face the challenges posed by the opposition, he said. The chief minister sent a video message to the people from his Tadepalli camp office, once the results of the elections were clear. While celebrating the victory, the chief minister said that the opposition was not able to digest the YSRC’s victory. Jagan dedicated the party’s victory to the grace of God and to the people and said the victory had given him an even greater responsibility to serve the people. The chief minister said he was indebted to the people who stood by the government and assured to work hard for their welfare. On this occasion, the chief minister said that over 95% of the promises given in the manifesto have been implemented. Jagan said that TDP leaders were constantly conspiring to destabilise the government and were unable to accept their defeat in the local body elections. All elections were held on party symbols by issuing A and B forms to contesting candidates and there is no issue of the opposition boycotting elections, he said. The chief minister alleged that the opposition acted irresponsibly by postponing the polls and the counting process by approaching courts and creating hurdles to good governance. He said if the elections had been completed in 2020, all those elected bodies would have been functional during the Covid-19 crisis. Meanwhile, ministers Dharmana Krishnadas, Vellampalli Srinivas, Kodali Venkateswara Rao, Ch Sriranganatha Raju, chief minister’s programme coordinator Talasila Raghuram and APSHCL chairman Davuluri Dorababu met the chief minister at the camp office and congratulated him for for winning in ZPTC and MPTC elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/cm-jagan-thanks-voters-for-decisive-mandate/articleshow/86378109.cms||Gopi Dara

State health minister Mangal Pandey on Monday said the decision was taken as the cases of polio were being reported in Pakistan and Afghanistan. “India is concerned because of such cases in the neighbouring countries. The central government is taking all measures to stop this poliovirus from spreading its tentacles in India,” said Pandey, adding, “Even a single case of polio anywhere in the world could lead to its comeback.” He said Afghanistan had reported 56 polio cases and Pakistan 84 in 2020. Even in 2021, such cases were being reported from both the countries. Talking about the strategy to inoculate kids with polio drops in Bihar, Pandey said special focus will be given on children of migrants, nomads and those staying in hamlets and workers staying around brick kilns and in interiors. A special team will be formed to supervise that all the kids get their drops. Trained vaccinators will also be deployed at transit points like bus stands and railway stations so that none of the children miss their vaccine drops. Pandey even instructed district magistrates to form a polio task force in their respective districts before starting of the drive so that necessary instructions could be given to the healthcare workers and officials involved. He said those involved in carrying out this drive will have to follow Covid-19 protocol. Union government had arranged for free polio vaccination drive at airport for Afghan returnees as a preventive measure against the virus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/pulse-polio-drive-in-bihar-from-sept-26/articleshow/86375324.cms||Sheezan Nezami

A woman of Chausa gram panchayat in Buxar district informed the CM during his janata darbar programme that she was unable to work as the ‘nyay mitra’ after her panchayat was upgraded into a ‘nagar panchayat’. A ‘nyay mitra’ is employed in the village court to help illiterate litigants under the panchayati raj system. She urged the CM to adjust her ‘employment’ in some other department. Taking her grievance seriously, Nitish asked the chief secretary to look into all such cases and make arrangements for their employment. Meanwhile, the CM could not stop his smile when a retired principal of an Inter college in Gopalganj district urged him to get his village merged with Uttar Pradesh. Yogendra Mishra told the CM that his village is located near Bihar-Uttar Pradesh border in Gopalganj district. When Nitish asked whether there was no (approach) road in his village, the septuagenarian Mishra replied: “No, you have already got a road constructed up to my village.” When the CM asked him what was his problem then, the man replied: “Kushinagar district (UP) is just 1km away from my village. The geographical location of my village clearly indicates that it should be a part of Kushinagar district, instead of Bihar. I, therefore, request you to get my village merged with UP.” Nitish was literally confused for a moment after hearing the retired principal’s demand. As Mishra once again repeated his demand, the CM could not stop his smile and asked his office staff to take him to the senior officials of the road construction department. Nitish heard the grievances of altogether 123 applicants at the janata darbar and sent their applications to senior officials of the departments concerned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nitish-employ-nyay-mitras-of-all-upgraded-panchayats/articleshow/86376644.cms||Madan Kumar

However, every year, environmentalists especially bird lovers have been opposing illumination around trees and hammering of nails for this purpose. Now they have decided to use a circular issued by the forest cell of BBMP banning hammering of nails on trees and using trees for illumination. Recently district minister ST Somashekar had said this year 100km long lighting decoration will be made in the city as part of Dasara. According to an order issued by BBMP tree officer on September 14, the hammering of nails, rods, etc. on trees is an offence. Now activists from Mysuru want a similar order in the city to protect trees. They feel it should be started by protecting trees from lighting during Dasara. Clean Mysore Foundation treasurer Venkatesh Kharidi said, “Plants and trees around the city are decorated in the name of attracting tourists. It is affecting the trees as well as the birds which stay in these trees. This lighting is continued for nearly a month. We want authorities to spare the trees from decoration,” he said. “Even though the government has proposed a simple Dasara this year, there are plans of illumination. We want the authorities concerned also not hammer nails into them lay wires,” he said. Deputy commissioner Bagadi Gautham said, “The idea is to do lighting well this time as anyway we have a simple Dasara. Regarding hammering of nails, I will place a request with CESC, Mysore.” When contacted, Dasara illumination sub-committee deputy special officer and CESC managing director Jayavibhavaswamy said they will follow any instruction given by the deputy commissioner. “The district administration will take a final decision and as of now, illumination will be done the way it was done in 2019,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/dont-hammer-trees-in-the-name-of-illumination-activists/articleshow/86378620.cms||Shrinivasa M

The last date for submission of the applications was September 14. Delhi-based Srishti and Madhav Dhir and Darwin Platform Group are the two resolution applicants and have offered a two-part payment structure offering a similar upfront amount, followed by a phased disbursal of amount in a three-seven year period. The actual dues are worth close to Rs8,000 crore. The Committee of Creditors is expected to finalise the process through a series of meetings by the first week of October. The hill station citizens stated that they hoped that one of the two bidders should be allowed to completely take over the project. “The state government also needs to intervene. We want to ensure that the project does not enter into the process of liquidation,” said Suresh Goswami, a senior citizen from Lavasa who has sent letters to the state and Centre on the issue. The citizens hoped that one of the bidders agreed to the lender’s request to give an unconditional plan so that the project could be taken forward. With the first meeting of the CoC scheduled soon, a citizen said there would be several meetings before the final applicant was selected for the project TOI reached out to Srishti Dhir (Srishti and Madhav Dhir are one the resolution applicants), who expressed their inability to share details of the bid for “confidentiality-related concerns”.

The academic, who was the chief guest at an interactive session with teachers at Sri Krishna College of Engineering and Technology (SKCET) in Kuniyamuthur here, emphasised on the importance of quality faculty members, sponsored research and industry collaborative research that will pave way to build stronger institutions. “By incorporating the new education policy, institutions would be entitled to give degrees to their students in due course. Hence, quality of curriculum and teaching, multi-disciplinary approach, adapting and implementing emerging technologies and encouraging industry institution partnership would play a major role in the growth of institutions.”Forerunning institutions should handhold other institutions in implementing best practices, which would enhance the overall growth of technical education, Anil said.Asked about AICTE’s plan to develop more industrial collaborations that will result in offering training and certificates for faculty members, he said currently, a number of multinational companies have leaned towards offering training and certification as a part of their CSR activities. “This seems to increase exponentially. AICTE will act as a bridge connecting industry and students on one platform. Students should be encouraged to enrol and use the internships offered through the AICTE portal.” Talking about the faculty development programme, the academic insisted on continuous training modules for young faculty and recommended updating series for experienced faculty. “Updating teaching learning process and evaluation should be a continuous process. Learning and relearning will bridge the gap between generations,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/encourage-students-to-take-up-cross-major-courses-academic/articleshow/86378617.cms||---

But the restoration work carried out on the gate didn’t last even for five years. Neglect seems to have caught up with the Laheripura gate of the walled city again as the tin roof at the top of the gate collapsed on Monday morning. Work on the renovation of the gate began in 2012 and was completed in 2016. Since the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) did not have any expertise in the field, it had roped in the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) for the renovation project. During the renovation work and also before that the gate had witnessed damage with material falling off from the heritage structure. Even as the Laheripura Gate suffered damages, officials weren’t aware of it till the afternoon. Officials of both the housing and building department as well as the east zone of the civic body claimed that they were not aware about the incident. The tin roof collapsed at around 7am and the officials claimed ignorance about it even after 2pm. Also, there is no clarity over which department is responsible for looking after the gate. Officials of the housing and building department said the east zone officials took care of the gate even as the east zone officials claimed otherwise. The officials of ASI said that they were not involved in upkeep of the heritage structure at present. “It was long back that ASI had carried out the restoration work of Laheripura gate. Also, I have not received any reports regarding the said incident. So, will not be able to comment,” said Dr A M V Subramanyam, superintending archaeologist of Vadodara circle of ASI. Those championing the cause of heritage monuments in the city are seeing red over the development. “The VMC should inquire into the matter and find out if the restoration work was not up to the mark or if the gate was not maintained properly later,” said Vadodara convener of the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) Sajeev Joshi. Kiri Parikh from Navchetana Forum, which works on issues of the walled city, said that the gate was in a bad shape again. “Rs 70 lakh were spent on the gate in 2015-16. We have written to VMC officials as well as minister Rajendra Trivedi as the gate is situated in his constituency,” said Parikh. VMC Standing committee chairman Dr Hitendra Patel visited the gate later in the day. “We will try to ensure that those who carried out the restoration work do it again,” Patel said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/roof-of-laheripura-gate-collapses/articleshow/86376172.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Nagpur||World Alzheimer’s Day: Combined treatment from neurologist and psychiatrist is a must, say experts||Nagpur: Forgetting things, important dates or events, losing track of day, date, time and place, losing way to the house, difficulty while reading, unable to identify relatives and friends are common traits, especially in elderly people, and all these are signs of Alzheimer’s or dementia. The disease is becoming more common these days because people are living longer and a large chunk of the population is getting older. Alzheimer’s generally affects people above the age of 65. A small number of people have ‘early onset’ Alzheimer’s which starts when they are in their 30s or 40s. On World Alzheimer’s Day, doctors in the field of psychiatry and neurology told TOI about the combined treatment approach to tackle this disease. “A combined approach of treatment from a neurologist and a psychiatrist can help patients live a better life by slowing down the progress of the disorder,” said Dr Akshay Sarode, district programme officer for mental health in Nagpur distirct. “Current approaches to treating Alzheimer’s focus on helping people maintain mental function, treating the underlying disease process and managing behavioural symptoms. Research has shown that treating behavioural symptoms can make people with Alzheimer’s more comfortable and makes things easier for caregivers,” he said. According to the doctor, becoming well-informed about the disease is one important long-term strategy. “Programmes that teach families about various stages of Alzheimer’s and about ways to deal with difficult behaviour are a must. We are also planning to educate caregivers regarding their challenges,” Dr Sarode added. Veteran neurologist Dr Chandrashekhar Meshram said that at present there are no medicines to cure Alzheimer’s but some symptoms can be taken care of with drugs. “Dementia due to Vitamin B 12 deficiency or due to hypothyroidism can be cured with medicines. It’s important to consult expert doctors to identify these treatable causes. Some people complain of memory loss at a young age. It may be due to the underlying stress,” said Dr Meshram. Diet also plays an important role in dementia. People who take high carbohydrate diet, sugar in all forms, junk food, packaged food, aerated drinks, fruit juices and use vegetable oils for cooking like sunflower, rice bran, soybean oil and hydrogenated vegetable oil have more chances of developing dementia. Dr Meshram stressed on the importance of physical and mental exercises. “Abstinence from tobacco, smoking and alcohol, proper treatment of diabetes and hypertension, learning new things, developing hobbies and taking interest in social activities are important aspects to preserve memory and prevent dementia,” he added. SOME FACTS * About 50 million people with dementia in the world * 4 out of 1,000 people have dementia in India * Number will double in another 10 years * For some unknown reason, more common in women * Cells damaged and over a period of time brain shrinks * Mostly age group of 65 and above diagnosed with Alzheimer’s * Disease process starts about 20 years before diagnosis||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/world-alzheimers-day-combined-treatment-from-neurologist-and-psychiatrist-is-a-must-say-experts/articleshow/86378680.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande

A bench of Acting Chief Justice M S Ramachandra Rao and Justice T Vinod Kumar gave this interim order while hearing a PIL filed by W Shiv Kumar of Saifabad, who brought to the notice of the court the felling of trees at Ravindra Bharati. According to Shiva Kumar’s counsel Waddepalli Rachna, who moved a lunch motion, precious trees, some of them 50 years old, were being cut. “These trees are posing no threat to public life, yet GHMC officials chose to get them chopped off,” she said. The director of Kala Bhavan located within Ravindra Bharati had authorized the officials to cut these trees. He has no power to do so under the provisions of the Telangana Walta Act, 2002. GHMC has to obtain prior permission from the forest department to cut trees. GHMC, at best, can ask its staff to prune trees wherever it was necessary, she said. “These trees are also home to several rare species of birds that have their nests on them,” she added. The bench said that these actions were going contrary to the spirit of Harita Haaram. The bench issued notices to GHMC commissioner, forest officials and director of Kala Bhavan. The bench asked them to file their replies and till then stayed the axing of the trees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-stays-tree-axing-at-ravindra-bharati/articleshow/86380947.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

The fresh infiltration bid prompted the authorities to suspend mobile and internet services in Uri area of Baramulla district of north Kashmir to disrupt any communication between the terrorists and their bosses across the LoC. An extensive search operation was launched over the last 20 hours, a top army officer said on Monday. General officer Commanding (GoC) of Srinagar based 15 Corps Lieutenant General D P Pandey on Monday told reporters, “While one group was neutralized in Bandipora district, we are looking for a second group which infiltrated recently. I can assure you that we are quite alert on ground and will ensure that minimal infiltration takes place whenever the attempt is made.” The Army is yet to issue any formal statement on the development in Uri. This is the second infiltration attempt from this area this year. “We have gunned down the earlier group of infiltrators. The army is vigorously chasing the present group of about half a dozen armed infiltrators and are optimistic that they will be neutralized soon,” sources said. Officials said despite a close watch along the LoC there were 664 incidents of ceasefire violations and cross-border firing in J&K by Pakistan till June this year. This year, 86 terrorists were killed across J&K. In June and July alone, 36 militants were killed in 16 encounters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/fresh-infiltration-bid-from-uri-sector-mobile-internet-services-suspended-in-baramulla-district/articleshow/86384430.cms||M Saleem Pandit

A passerby Vithal Raikar shot a video of the damaged pipeline which resembled a large water fountain. A huge quantity of water was seen flowing out of the damaged portion. The public outrage was because few parts of Vasco do not receive water supply regularly due to slow pressure. Raikar said, “In Pernem and Canacona people are struggling to get drinking water. We knew that water would be free in Goa but we did not know it would be in this fashion.” Assistant engineer of the water section of the PWD, Nilesh Paingunkar, said, “There was a small leakage due to water pressure. It happens sometimes. In the afternoon, we stopped supply for a couple of hours and repaired the pipeline.” The pipeline supplies water from Verna to MES College road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/video-of-ruptured-water-pipeline-at-vasco-goes-viral/articleshow/86380990.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Rs 17 crore illicit income found in Anil Deshmukh case: I-T||MUMBAI: The search and seizure operation carried out on premises linked to former state home minister Anil Deshmukh has thrown up evidence of concealment of Rs 17crore income, the income-tax department has claimed. “Several bank lockers found during the course of operations have been put under prohibitory orders and evidence gathered is being examined,” said an I-T department press release. It said the operation was conducted on September 17 in the case of a prominent public figure in Nagpur and his family — pointing to the action against Deshmukh and his kin. Over 30 premises were covered in cities like Mumbai, New Delhi and Kolkata, apart from Nagpur. It first listed evidence of an unaccounted for Rs 4 crore being routed to the trust run by Deshmukh and his group. The amount has been received as donation routed through Delhi-based companies. This amount almost corresponds to the Rs 4.7 crore money trail to his trust that the ED has shown in its laundering case against him. I-T says it also got specific evidence that three educational institutions of the trust run by Deshmukh had been inflating expenses. The expenses were recorded as salaries paid to the staff, but part of it was collected back in cash. Evidence of such practices was found for several financial years, and the total amount comes to over Rs 12 crore, says the release. Another Rs 87 lakh had paid to brokers in cash for arranging admissions, says the release, detailing the Rs 17crore fraud it found. During the course of the search and seizure operation, many incriminating documents, loose sheets and digital evidence were found and seized. They indicate the involvement of the group in unaccounted for financial transactions made outside the regular books of accounts, including inflation of expenses, money laundering, bogus donation receipts, unaccounted cash expenses etc, the release said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/rs-17cr-illicit-income-found-in-deshmukh-case-in-mumbai-i-t/articleshow/86382926.cms||Shishir Arya

---||Kanpur||BJP never plays caste, religions based politics, says Uma Bharti||JHANSI: Former Madhya Pradesh chief minister and a senior BJP leader Uma Bharti said that BJP had never played caste or religion-based politics and was pitching for development and the welfare of the people. “The Modi government’s only agenda is development, good governance, good law and order, corruption-free bureaucracy and strong infrastructure”, she said during her visit to the city on Monday. Talking to mediapersons, the former CM said the Yogi Adityanath government in UP never plays politics based on caste or religion like other parties. Its main focus has been and is development of the state. “Yogi has outshined with his clean image, strong administrative ability and with no superstitious beliefs like the earlier UP chief ministers who had been reluctant to visit Noida because of the superstition of suffering political setbacks”. Yogi has broken this jinx, she added. Commenting on the newly appointed Punjab CM Charanjit Singh Channi, Uma Bharti said, “I have my full sympathy for the new Punjab CM as he is left with hardly any time to perform before the next assembly elections”. When asked that a similar situation is prevailing in Gujarat too, to which she said that Rupani had resigned on his own after proposing the name of the new chief minister. When reporters asked her why suddenly all the opposition leaders have started showing their inclination towards Hinduism and will it harm the BJP, Uma Bharti said for BJP, Hinduism is nationalism while for them (opposition), it is a political gimmick. “Their sudden inclination towards Hinduism is quite late, and the people are not going to believe them at least for another two decades”, she added. For BJP, Ram Mandir has always been a matter of faith and that is why after their government in UP was unconstitutionally dismissed by the Narasimha Rao government at the Centre after the demolition of the Babri Masjid, the party (BJP) did not hesitate to mention in its manifesto the construction of Ram which has been on its top priority, she said.  When reporters asked her if Owaisi is working as a ‘B’ team of the BJP to cut Muslim vote bank of the Samajwadi Party, Bharti said that BJP did not require any ‘B’ team as the entire state knew what used to be the law and order situation during the SP regime. Talking about separate Bundelkhand state, she said that delay in carving out a separate Bundelkhand state is because the demarcation of the boundaries has not been finalised so far. “People of Bundelkhand region which falls in Madhya Pradesh do not want a separate state while a separate Bundelkhand with only seven districts of UP will not be sustainable”. It may be mentioned that Uma Bharti after winning her Lok Sabha elections from Jhansi in 2014 had promised that a separate Bundelkhand state would be carved out within three years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/bjp-never-plays-caste-religions-based-politics-uma-bharti/articleshow/86380785.cms||---

The victim Anil Sonule (36) from Khandala village in Sindewahi tehsil had taken cattle for grazing when the incident took place. Sonule was accompanied by two shepherds and they had left the cattle grazing in compartment no. 563 in Palasgaon (Piparda) beat, adjacent to the Sindewahi range. While Sonule was watching over his cattle, a tiger attacked him. Fellow shepherds rushed to help him and waved their sticks to scare the tiger away. However, by the time the tiger fled, Sonule was dead. RFO, Ramesh Themaskar confirmed the human kill and claimed that the department has given ex gratia aid of Rs25,000 to the kin of the deceased. He said camera traps have been installed in the area to identify the tiger responsible for the kill. Residents of nearby villages have been warned against venturing into the forest, he said. This incident has taken the toll in predator attacks this year to 31. Year 2020 had seen 31 human kills in predator attacks in the district, which was a record high for any year. Despite intense mitigation measures being undertaken by the forest department, the toll has reached the highest mark this year in just eight-and-a-half months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/shepherd-killed-in-tiger-attack-in-tadoba-buffer/articleshow/86378734.cms||Mazhar Ali
---||Hyderabad||Telangana revenue down 3% till July: CAG estimate||HYDERABAD: The overall revenue collection of state till July has declined by 3%, according to Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) income estimates for states. However, sales tax collection has risen by 15% vis-a-vis July last year, while stamps and registration earnings climbed by 12%. As usual, GST collections accounted for the lion’s share of tax receipts (Rs 28,591 crore), followed by sales tax (Rs 8,218 crore) and excise (Rs 4,791 crore). The state’s portion of Union taxes was Rs 2,178 crore compared to a projected Rs 8,721 crore. GST collection has reached 25% of total budget estimates against 18% in July last year.  Similarly, sales tax receipts reached 31% of estimated budget figures for the same period against 16% last year. This year the total tax receipts till July was 19% when compared to 16% last year. Non-tax revenue was Rs 1,925 crore as opposed to Rs 30,557 crore last year. The state government’s tax and non-tax income remain a major source of concern at a time when it is attempting to stabilise its financial position in the aftermath of the pandemic-induced downturn. The state has accumulated a revenue deficit of Rs 9,483 crore till July. There was an estimated surplus of Rs 6,743 crore, but Covid resulted in decreased earnings. Another concern is that the state has already borrowed 32% of its budgeted estimates through July. While salaries and wages accounted for Rs 8,560 crore in expenditure, pensions cost Rs 2,067 crore and subsidies Rs 3,682 crore. The revenue account expenditure was Rs 18,826 crore against Rs 1.02 lakh projected for the entire year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-revenue-down-3-till-july-cag-estimate/articleshow/86380958.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

It was like a dream come true. He has given us a new lease of life,” says Amritlal, while talking to TOI after meeting the Union minister. Scindia also tweeted a picture with three pilots saying that the struggle and success of this family from Morena is a matter of pride and inspiration for us. “A daily wager father has played an important role in educating his children and making them pilots,” – Scindia tweeted. “His elder son Ajay is making a flight simulator for the country. My regards to his father’s confidence and courage,” he added while sharing the TOI story on Amritlal’ s struggle. Amritlal and his three sons – Capt Ajay, Deepak and Vijay were invited by Scindia to his office. “We are grateful to the minister for giving us an opportunity to meet him in person. It’s a great pleasure for us. He has asked me to be in touch with him and has assured all possible help in my research work,” said Capt Ajay. Madhya Pradesh BJP President V D Sharma also took it to social media. “Inspirational. It’s a result of hard work by a Morena-based labour that today his three sons are pilots,” Sharma tweeted. TOI had reported how daily wager Amritlal, 54, who worked his heart out to put his sons through flight school, and how one of them developed a home-built flight simulator. Today, Amritlal is under a heavy debt of education loans and money they borrowed for studies. A small piece of land they owned is mortgaged with a moneylender. But Amritlal is at peace as his sons have taken over the responsibility of repaying the dues. All three are commercial pilots. For decades, Amritlal, of Morena district in Madhya Pradesh, slogged doing odd jobs in a bid to give wings to his sons’ dreams. He recently shifted to a rented house in Bhopal along with his eldest son, captain Ajay Singh, 28, who has been working on a DIY simulator for five years. Unable to fly plane during the lockdown, Ajay devoted his energy to build the simulator cockpit to feed his passion for flying. Flying clubs in the country import such simulators for over Rs 1 crore per unit, but he has built one at a third of the cost, he says. This is his contribution towards the dream of an Atmanirbhar Bharat, says Ajay.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/union-min-scindia-meets-morena-pilot-bros/articleshow/86378720.cms||P Naveen
---||Nagpur||‘Why pay compensation if attacks take place in reserve forest areas?’||Nagpur: Most of the deaths by big carnivores occurring in the reserve forests areas of Gadchiroli and Chandrapur districts have stirred up a debate whether compensation should be paid if villagers are found entering the forest illegally and get killed in tiger/leopard attacks? Since January 2021, 58 persons, 34 in the Chandrapur district alone, have died in wild animal attacks. The state government pays Rs 15 lakh compensation to the kin of the victims if they are killed by wild animals. The PCCF’s (wildlife) orders are already in place to capture two tigers. There have been cases where compensation has been granted to the victim’s kin even if the attack happened in the core area of the tiger reserve. On June 12, Bharat Bawne (Mudholi), who entered Tadoba’s core area to collect bamboo and was killed by a tiger, was also paid compensation. TOI spoke to a section of wildlife experts working in the region for more than three decades to get an insight on the issue. State wildlife board member Kishor Rithe says, “There is no provision to pay ex-gratia if someone goes inside the core area of a tiger reserve. But in buffer and corridor areas, the state government pays compensation on humanitarian grounds.” Rithe said in the buffer area, the forest department has already provided alternatives to every forest-dependent activity like grazing, fuelwood and minor forest produce (MFP) collection to ensure people do not intrude in tiger habitats through a Dr Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Jan Van Vikas Yojana. “We need to educate government departments as well as villagers about tiger corridors and alert them about tiger movements in these corridors. Presently, not all the corridor villages enjoy the benefits of the Jan Van scheme,” says Rithe. “We need to bring all such villages under this scheme. We can also think of reducing or stopping ex-gratia in buffer and corridors. Paying ex-gratia is not the solution to the problem. By implementing the scheme in all such areas, we can reduce the gravity of the problem,” says Rithe. Wildlife conservationist Prafulla Bhamburkar said, “Ex-gratia for human and cattle loss and injury by wild animals in Maharashtra is the highest in the country. Still, there is no change in the mindset of people towards forest and wildlife protection. Most locals are interested in forests for revenue gains and to fulfill their daily needs with free access. In such conditions, wild animals, especially big cats, are treated as a burden and even denied their natural right in the forest as habitat.” Even Gadchiroli honorary wildlife warden Uday Patel says compensation should not be given. “No compensation should be given if a person is killed in the reserve forest compartment. Instead, their family should be booked for trespassing,” he said. “It has been observed that old people over 55 years are sent to the forest for MFP collection and cattle grazing. Old people have poor vision, hearing loss and cannot resist any attack due to age. No compensation should be given in prime tiger habitats like natural streams, ravines and inviolate areas. Increase in compensation has failed to deter people from venturing into the forest,” adds Patel. He called for ‘gau audit’ (cattle audit), which means an affidavit must be submitted by the owner regarding the assessment of the number of cattle heads and utilities. This way, the cattle population can be restricted. “Villagers are utilizing forest land for rearing cattle and earning money illegally by selling these cattle to slaughterhouses. The state should take up stall feeding in a big way. This is the best way to control grazing and protecting cows,” said Patel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/why-pay-compensation-if-attacks-take-place-in-reserve-forest-areas/articleshow/86378711.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

The selected folk artistes would perform in awareness programs to spread awareness regarding government welfare schemes in the district. The auditions are scheduled from Tuesday (September 21) However, the protesting artistes have said they all are reeling under the economic impacts of Covid-19 and thus, rather than holding auditions and selecting only a few of them, they should all be given work. As part of the protests, the artistes took out a procession and burnt an effigy of the state government. Some of them even staged a hunger strike at Almora's Gandhi Park. “Just as all students have been promoted to the next class without examinations in the wake of Covid-19, we should also be given work without auditions,” said a protesting folk artist. When asked about the issue, Ajnesh Rana, district information officer, told TOI, “The directorate general in Dehradun has been intimated of the protest.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/almoras-state-registered-folk-artistes-protest-auditions/articleshow/86378712.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Won’t allow Konkan E-way until Goa highway work is over: Bombay HC||MUMBAI: Bombay high court on Monday frowned at the state government on its plans to construct the Greenfield Konkan Expressway from Mumbai to Sindhudurg when the four-laning work on Mumbai-Goa (NH66) is incomplete after over a decade. “Without completing this, you are going for another highway to Sindhudurg... Unless you complete this work, we will not allow you to go ahead with any other project. Let the public reap the benefits of this project,’’ said Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni while hearing a PIL by advocate Owais Pechkar, that the work that began in 2010 is delayed and potholes are back. Pechkar said while main highway work is pending, they are diverting the issue by announcing construction of the Rs 70,000 crore Expressway. “They don’t even respect court orders,’’ he said, adding that this is a second public interest litigation (PIL). The judges said the state must have a concrete policy for potholes. “We wonder why the state government does not think of a concrete policy to be implemented all over for potholes, given the number of deaths and traffic jams. Why can’t there be continuous maintenance to identify potholes?” asked justice Kulkarni. He recalled being on a two-judge committee, in a PIL on potholes in Mumbai, before which a solution was given to repair potholes with a mix of old plastic bottles and had proved to be very effective. “Why this kind of technology is not used? ” he asked. The bench pointed out that the first order on potholes was passed by justice (retired) R M Lodha in 1996. “We are in 2021. There is no improvement. We wonder if there is any will. Thanks to him, (justice Lodha) at least there are some places in Mumbai we can peacefully travel,” said justice Kulkarni. According to the PIL, the contracts are given on an 84km stretch from Panvel to Indapur over which National Highway Authority of India (Nhai) has jurisdiction and on a 366km stretch from Indapur to Dharap in Sindhudurg which comes under the state Public Works Department. Pechkar said that Nhai’s reply states that the contractor will complete the work on March 31, 2022 after receiving Rs 267 crore from lenders. The judges took note from a chart submitted by advocate general (AG) Ashutosh Kumbhakoni most work has been completed, but for a portion where a contractor lagged and has been terminated. The AG said potholes are on diversion areas, not on the completed portions of the highway. “We want to know what you will do regarding potholes,” said justice Kulkarni. The judges granted the state three weeks for pothole repairs. They said they will grant it time till December to complete the pending work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/hc-wont-allow-konkan-e-way-until-goa-highway-work-is-over-in-mumbai/articleshow/86383550.cms||Rosy Sequeira

The regional food was heavily influenced by this knowledge, claimed the Edible Archive team, to keep the population healthy.  The team was hosted by the newly-founded Centre for Inter-Asian Research at Ahmedabad University for two-day event on September 17 and 18. The event in 2019 had traveled to China and engaged in culinary conversations with local chefs in Suzhou and Shanghai. “In 2021, we are now continuing the dialogue in India with both online and offline events. We are bringing in culinary experts and practitioners of Ayurveda and TCM to discuss how health aspects were integrated in the food habits,” said Prof Tejaswini Niranjana, director of the Centre. The participants cooked both Indian and Chinese dishes using the locally-available ingredients along with spices from both the countries. The organizers said that with heightened awareness about food and medicine after the worst of pandemic, the legacy of traditional medicine can help the citizens. Vd Bhavdeep Ganatra, a city-based Ayurveda practitioner, said that Ayurveda has prescribed food for every Indian season which is so deeply interwoven with our traditions that we don’t realize it. “The milk and poha we consume on Sharad Purnima is associated with pitta. Similarly, the broth we consume during monsoons is to ensure that mild appetite gets support by the spices used,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/food-served-as-medicine-in-india-china-for-centuries/articleshow/86378775.cms||---

---||Delhi||Top Kuki insurgent held in Delhi, abduction bid foiled||NEW DELHI: A plan to abduct officials of a construction company for ransom was foiled by police with the arrest of the self-styled commander-in-chief of a militant outfit, Kuki National Front (KNF), from southwest Delhi on Sunday night. The suspect has been identified as Mangkholam Kipgen alias David. Wanted for kidnapping, snatching arms from police, ransom, etc, Kipgen (24) had made the capital his base for operations. DCP (Special Cell) Pramod Singh Kushwaha said, “He was arrested by a team led by ACPs Lalit Mohan Negi and Hriday Bhushan from Sector 7 in Dwarka. He belongs to Kangpokpi district in Manipur.” KNF, formed in 1988, is said to have close ties with United National Liberation Front and People’s Liberation Army. Recently, over a hundred of its recruits had apparently trained in Myanmar, sources said. On September 19 morning, inspector Ravinder Tyagi from New Delhi range of Special Cell received a tip-off about the movement of the wanted insurgent in Dwarka after which a raid was conducted. The suspect was apprehended after being identified by an informer. During interrogation, Kipgen disclosed that he quit studies after Class VII. In 2018, he came in contact with KNF cadres of his village and got engaged with them in extortion, robbery, dacoity, etc. “Soon, he became infamous for snatching weapons of security personnel, kidnapping for ransom, extortion and other heinous crimes. In June 2020, he declared himself as commander-in-chief of KNF,” said Kushwaha. On the intervening night of December 12-13, 2020, his associates and he overpowered and kidnapped two sentries of Kangvai police outpost in Churachandpur district, Manipur and took away their weapons. Later, eight of his cadres were apprehended in an operation and the snatched weapons were recovered, but Kipgen managed to flee. He went underground and began to operate covertly. On February 18 this year, Kipgen and his associates abducted a Nepalese citizen for ransom.

Of it, Rs 15 crore will be used exclusively for facilities to treat mucormycosis, a deadly fungal infection that many got after Covid treatment. The equipment will be distributed among the 19 government-run medical colleges across the state according to requirement, said the official order. “This is the highest-ever sanction for procurement of equipment and machinery exclusively for the treatment of Covid-19 and mucormycosis,” a senior official told TOI. The public health and medical education departments are fully geared up for a possible third wave, he said. “We are not sure, but we will not take a chance, our entire network is prepared to tackle the third wave.

Our slogan is ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’,” said Yogi, adding, “In the previous government, development was done on face value.” He added, “Only four districts got uninterrupted power supply while 71 others remained in the dark. When the people suffered due to epidemics like dengue, encephalitis or natural calamities including floods, the rulers who cared only for themselves and their families remained busy in enjoying dance and music programmes by artistes from Mumbai in Saifai.” Highlighting large-scale migration from Jaunpur, Yogi said, “Had the past governments created an atmosphere to attract investors and mega investments, local youths would not have been compelled to leave their homes for earning a livelihood.” Yogi further said, “Even when recruitments for government jobs were launched in the previous government, people from the ruling family went out with big bags to generate money. But, in my government jobs are being given to the deserving with full transparency. All those who tried to break the sanctity of the recruitment process have been sent behind the bars.” “Development had never been the agenda of SP and BSP,” he said adding, “In SP regime there was a competition of grabbing benefits of government schemes, including ration by the people associated with the ruling party. In the BSP regime, the development issues were lost in the big stomach of the elephant (BSP symbol). Today, efforts on the crime and law and order front has not only changed the image of UP, but also made the state free of frequent riots which took place during the festivals like Ramleela and Durga Puja.” “Directives have been issued to officials in all districts to allow Durga Puja celebrations and Ramleelas at open places by ensuring strict compliance of Covid-19 protocol,” he said. He also appealed to the people of Mungra Badshahpur assembly area not to repeat the mistake of 2017 assembly election when Sushma Patel had won on a BSP ticket but was suspended by her party in 2020 following her meeting with the SP chief. “Had BJP’s Seema Dwivedi retained the seat, each and every citizen of this assembly area would have considered himself as a ‘badshah’. But, despite losing this seat, the BJP continued helping the people here with government schemes without any discrimination and major development projects of over Rs 250 crores were also launched,” he added. Hinting towards the 2022 assembly polls, Yogi said that the coming six months were crucial and everyone should intensify preparations for the BJP’s victory.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/our-slogan-is-sabka-saath-sabka-vikas-yogi/articleshow/86380612.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Heli services to Kedarnath to start from October||Dehradun: After the start of the Char Dham Yatra last week, plans are now afoot to resume chopper service to Kedarnath. Tenders had been floated and approved in March this year, but the pilgrimage could not start in wake of the second phase of Covid-19. Later, the government announced to start the yatra from July 1, but the high court stayed the pilgrimage over Covid safety concerns. Now to restart the chopper service, the state needs a fresh clearance from the DGCA office. Tourism minister Satpal Maharaj told TOI, “We are making our efforts to start the chopper service at the earliest. However, the weather is a major deterrent. Heavy rains are expected in the next few days. People coming to the state for the yatra should plan their visit accordingly.” Meanwhile, civil aviation secretary Dilip Jawalkar pointed out that an important meeting with the helicopter operators has been called on Tuesday. “In the meeting, we will ask them about their preparedness and the condition of the helicopters. Each issue would be studied and discussed in detail.” After the meeting, the state will request the DGCA for consent. “A DGCA team will inspect the helipad and check other details before giving its consent. With rains predicted in the next few days, we expect the chopper service to resume from October,” said a senior IAS officer. Char Dham Devasthanam Board officials, meanwhile, said they are getting a good response from people for the yatra. Around 42,000 e-passes for pilgrims have been issued in the past two days. Several devotees, 1,361 of them, visited Char Dham on Monday. Out of which, 672 prayed at Kedarnath, 375 at Badrinath, 212 at Gangotri and 102 at Yamunotri.

BNPL refers to the tech-enabled credit that is extended to borrowers at the point of sale as a payment option. Unlike credit cards, the credit decision is taken on the spot using technology for the sale amount. “With BNPL, banks and other lenders can reimagine credit. It is like providing sachet-sized credit lines to customers without having to bear the cost of credit-card infrastructure or the extensive process related to personal loans,” said Yezdi Lashkari, founder of Flexmoney Technologies — a company that enables BNPL loans for top banks in the country. He added that the platform provides lenders the flexibility of opening up credit windows temporarily during festivals and hiking limits for a short period. Currently, lenders are increasing limits ahead of the forthcoming festivals. Besides Flexmoney, there are other players like Paytm, LazyPay, Simpl, Capital Float and ZestMoney that are active in the BNPL segment. According to a Bernstein report, BNPL market in India is estimated at $15 billion with the potential to hit $100 billion by 2025. Fintech players would account for 25% of the total market by then. Square’s recent acquisition of BNPL fintech Afterpay for $29 billion has added to the buzz. Until now, BNPL credit was either subsidised by vendors, such as mobile phone companies, who extended schemes where the buyer pays zero interest or at interest rates that are on par with what is charged by credit cards for EMI options. Flexmoney is a fintech that brings together some of the largest banks (HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Kotak, IDFC First Bank & Federal Bank) and other lenders on one end and retail & online merchants (Amazon, Flipkart, Vijay Sales, Urban Ladder) on the other. It is in talks with secured lenders like home loan providers and gold loan companies to expand the BNPL market and drastically bring down the cost of credit. Lenders who already have a home loan or gold loan can provide a top-up loan to the customer within seconds at the time of checkout. According to Lashkari, Flexmoney will apply for a payment aggregator licence. What has made BNPL possible is that banks have a database of nearly 90 crore accounts, including loans and deposits. They now have a list of customers to whom they can lend small amounts like, say, Rs 10,000. Firms like Flexmoney have the technology to provide merchants with a small software that will enable them to include BNPL as a payment option. In the case of physical stores, the option appears on the card swipe machine screen while for online merchants it is a small javascript patch. A mobile number registered with the lender is enough to identify the borrower while an additional factor is required to release payment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/buy-now-pay-later-loans-to-disrupt-market/articleshow/86367917.cms||Mayur Shetty

The case has been registered following a complaint lodged by one of the victims, senior officials said. No arrests, however, have been made so far. According to the police First Investigation Report (FIR), the two men, IB officials Pramod Kumar and Mahinder Gusain, have been booked under IPC sections 420 (cheating), 120B (criminal conspiracy) among others. The forgery came to light last year in January when a complaint was made by one of the victims who stated that he was approached by Kumar in 2014, who assured him of a job in Dak department of the home ministry. “The complainant said Kumar and he belong to the same village, and using that connection, Kumar had told him in January 2014 that he was working in the Intelligence Bureau, a wing of the home ministry, and that he had contacts using which he could help him get a government job. The man said Kumar had promised him a job as a Dak dispatcher and had charged him Rs 17 lakh, on different occasions. He even forged documents and handed them over to the victim, assuring that his application was being processed,” said a senior police officer. However, in 2014 itself, when he didn’t get the job, the victim asked Kumar to return his money, but the latter didn’t pay any attention. “The complainant told police that he even visited the office to collect information about his appointment but didn’t get any satisfactory response. He then filed an application under RTI and was told that the documents he had been given were fake. It was then that the complainant reported the matter to the police, the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cops-book-2-ib-officers-in-fake-job-racket/articleshow/86378822.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala govt to go ahead with Sabarimala airport project||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Despite the queries raised by the ministry of civil aviation (MoCA) on the proposed airport at Sabarimala, the government is going to implement the project. Government started preparations for site survey and drone survey of Cheruvally estate has been earmarked for the project. A review meeting held by CM Pinarayi Vijayan on Sept 8 had assessed the project (categorized as a top priority infra project of the government), discussed its status and the steps that need to be taken immediately to speed up its implementation. Quoting the observations of the director general of civil aviation (DGCA), the ministry of civil aviation had sought certain clarifications from the government while considering the application for project clearance. A decision was taken during the CM’s review to furnish a reply in this regard. The clearance from the ministry of defence is expected soon as Indian Air Force (IAF) has conveyed that it has no objection in granting site clearance. But, social impact assessment study, soil test couldn’t be conducted due to pending litigations on possession of the designated land. “Whatever MoCA mentioned in the letter quoting DGCA’s report is part of routine administrative communication. The letter itself indicates that despite the guidelines on greenfield airports that the proposed airport may not satisfy, the project can still be cleared by the Centre,” said government sources. The proposed site will require a considerable amount of preparatory work to make it suitable for the project. As per the environmental impact assessment report prepared by the consultant M/s Louis Berger Consulting Pvt Ltd, a preliminary analysis of the site topography indicates that the existing elevation varies from 40m to 170m, while the existing, average mean elevation is around 112m. The observed site is challenging in terms of requirement of grading as there is a vast difference between maximum and minimum elevation. The central part of the project site is at higher elevation whilst the boundaries are at a lower elevation. Existing topography consists of moderately-high to steep slopes in a considerable area of the project site, the report said. There are several other challenges, according to the consultant’s report. Though the proposed project does not fall within the 10km radius of the eco-sensitive boundary of Periyar Tiger Reserve, as the final notification of the eco-sensitive zone is yet to be published, a recommendation from the national board for wildlife may be required for the project. It has been estimated that 130 structures and five common property resources will be impacted (approximately), including a church, a temple, a mosque and a hospital. The airport – which is estimated to have 800 passengers during peak hour by 2029-30 and 1,850 passengers during peak hour by 2049-50 – is expected to break even only in 60 years, said the consultant. This raises several questions on the economic viability of the project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/state-govt-to-go-ahead-with-sabarimala-airport-project/articleshow/86381110.cms||KP Saikiran
---||Mumbai||Corporators are worried as BMC halts road works||MUMBAI: As civic elections draw closer, corporators are worried over the BMC delaying upcoming road works in the city owing to many contractors having quoted much below the estimated costs. Last week, the civic body decided to put on hold the 30- plus road work tenders amounting to more than Rs 1,000 crore, stating that going by the rate analysis, it would not be possible for the contractors to ensure standards of quality of the road works. Bandra corporator Asif Zakaria in a series of tweets tagging the civic roads department said the internal file note clearly highlights the shocking style of working of the roads department being red-flagged by the head of the department himself. “Many of the roads, which are proposed for improvement, were planned to have been undertaken five years ago during the 2017 civic elections,” he said. Bharatiya Janata Party’s group leader in BMC Vinod Mishra said that this was not the first time that corporators had bid much below the estimated costs. “Deposits are required to be paid by the contractors at the time of taking up such works. The BMC, therefore, could get contractors to forfeit their deposit in case they did not undertake the works as per the required standards,” Mishra said. Leader of Opposition in the BMC Ravi Raja, however, said that it was clearly not a case of a lack of funds. “The BMC keeps aside a certain amount for capital works and it is unfortunate that they are taking so long to make a decision on re-inviting tenders. Also, the BMC must tolerate bidders who bid below the estimated costs only to a certain extent and not consider those who offer to take up a work for as much as 30 per cent lower than the actual costs,” he said. Samajwadi party leader in the BMC Rais Shaikh said that on one hand, the BMC is spending on extravagant projects such as penguin enclosures for the zoo and cycle tracks while on the other, essential works, which were expected to begin from October onwards, are being delayed probably due to a ‘lack of funds’. “There is clearly a lack of funds for works like roads, which are important infrastructure projects to be built for the common man,” said Shaikh. Earlier last week, additional municipal commissioner P Velrasu, in a note before the civic roads department, said when rebates range from 26% to 30%, a question arises whether the work will be done according to the standards prescribed in the tender document.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-corporators-are-worried-as-bmc-halts-road-works/articleshow/86383576.cms||Richa Pinto

These bills are the Gujarat Professional Medical Education Colleges and Institutions(Amendment) Act, the Gujarat Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act, 2021, the Gujarat Private University Amendment Ordinance and the Indian Partnership Gujarat Amendment Act, 2021. A limited number of people will be allowed to enter the assembly building, only after undergoing Covid-19 tests due to the pandemic.

The mutual respect, trust and love among communities are now at stake due to the present controversies, the letter said. “The state is known for its communal harmony and mutual trust among the people. Hence leaders like you should come forward to guide the people and show them the true path of mutual respect and love.

Police have, however, registered a case of rash driving as they suspect that the man’s bike slipped as it was raining on the day of the incident. The deceased identified as Himmat Savani was returning home in Sama along with his wife on his bike when the accident took place near Aiyappa ground. Savani’s son Kirtan said that his parents fell as a cow came on the road and the bike hit the bovine. “Initially, we felt that they may have slipped, but later on asking around people we came to know that a cow suddenly got up and came in front of them due to which they fell,” said Kirtan. Savani’s wife suffered minor injuries while his ribs were fractured and he suffered brain haemorrhage. The couple was taken to SSG Hospital where Savani died during treatment. Kirtan said that the civic authorities should take some action, so that a similar incident does not happen again. “I just do not want anyone else to go through what our family is going through right now, so a permanent solution regarding bovines roaming around on road should be brought,” he said. “We have taken a strict view regarding the cows being let loose by their owners on the road. Earlier during festivals, VMC used to release the cows without charging fees, but this year we have not done so,” Vadodara mayor Keyur Rokadia told TOI. “We have asked the state government to give a grazing land in the areas which are now part of Vadodara city, so that we can ask the cattle owners to shift their animals there,” he added. It was just last month that a VMC staffer Arvind Rana was knocked down by a cow. Rana was rushed to a nearby hospital where it was found that he had suffered fractures in his hand and leg. In the past few years, several people have died or have got injured by cows roaming on the roads of the city. The civic body has also lodged criminal complaints against cow owners, but it has hardly improved the situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/60-year-old-man-who-ran-into-cow-succumbs-after-nine-days/articleshow/86376427.cms||---

The announcement was made by state education minister Arvind Pandey which has led to backlash from the state’s private schools. The private schools association has claimed that there is no reason for the state government to ask them not to charge the entire fees since the provision for charging only the tuition fees was made until the online classes were being held. The government has explained the rationality behind this decision stating that the schools have been reopened only to bring normalcy while the restriction on all other types of activities being held in the schools are still prohibited. Also, the education department has maintained that the schools will operate for three hours only. Meanwhile, the block education officers (BEO) have been deputed to take feedback from the students regarding the quality of study taking place in their respective schools. The feedback will be taken from the students who are attending the offline classes and also from those who are still preferring the online mode. The decision has been taken considering that the primary schools are reopening after 18 months and students, as well as teachers, are likely to take some time before adjusting to the pre-Covid school routine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/schools-in-ukhand-allowed-to-charge-only-tuition-fees/articleshow/86378868.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||Dehradun||Action sought against dairy owners for animal cruelty||Dehradun: The society for prevention of cruelty of animals (SPCA) has submitted a report accusing dairy owners of injecting oxytocin to increase milk production in cows. Despite a ban on the sale of oxytocin, the dairy owners were resorting to the illegal practice, they alleged. It is learnt that SPCA teams visited dairies situated at Lakshman Chowk and along the Kanwali road, where they got their hands on the evidence of illegality. Rubina Nitin Iyer, member, SPCA, said she had written to the Dehradun district magistrate, apprising him of the issue and that a complaint had also been filed at the Kotwali police station.” The report stated that the five dairies that the team had visited were overcrowded and that the animals there were not being fed properly. Despite being banned and considered a cognisable offence under Section 12 of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, the use of non-therapeutic drug at dairies is rampant, which enables more production of milk. On the illegal practice, Dehradun district magistrate R Rajesh Kumar said a team, led by the ADM and SP (City), had been formed to crack down on such offenders. Gauri Maulekhi, trustee, PFA, said “Dairies are regulated by the pollution control board, municipal corporation and have to comply with cattle premises regulation rules. Still, such practices keep coming to the fore. The NGT has labelled the dairy industry under the orange category (hazardous units).” Dr DC Tewari, senior veterinary officer, Dehradun civic body, said, “Action is taken against those abandoning cattle. In the last one month, we have imposed a fine of Rs 90,000 on dairy farmers and cattle owners accused of violating norms, including mandatory tagging of cattle.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/action-sought-against-dairy-owners-for-animal-cruelty/articleshow/86378881.cms||Abhijeet Singh

Accused Sakalsingh Pawar, who hails from Yavatmal, has been charged with murder. The man had first lied to officials of Sanpada police station that his second wife had assaulted the boy as she was angry after a quarrel they had, said senior railway police inspector Vishnu Kesarkar. However, CCTV footage nailed the father, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/mumbai-banged-on-floor-4-yr-old-dies-dad-held/articleshow/86383590.cms||George Mendonca
---||Mumbai||Kirit Somaiya detained on way to Kolhapur to file ‘graft case’||MUMBAI: BJP leader Kirit Somaiya’s campaign against ministers of the MVA government witnessed fresh drama with his detention at Karad railway station in the early hours of Monday. He was en route to Kolhapur where he was planning to lodge a complaint against rural development minister Hasan Mushrif from the NCP, whom he has accused of financial irregularities. Even as BJP attacked the government, the Shiv Sena appeared to distance itself from the episode, saying the decision was taken by the NCP-controlled home department. Somaiya had alleged Mushrif was involved in two scams: a Rs 127 crore money laundering case and a Rs 100 crore scam involved in purchase of a cooperative sugar factor in Kolhapur. Mushrif strongly denied the charges and said he would file two defamation suits for Rs 100 crore and Rs 50 crore against Somaiya. The drama began on Sunday itself, when police teams arrived outside Somaiya’s Mulund residence in an attempt to restrain him from leaving for Kolhapur. Somaiya accused the government of “dadagiri” and alleged he was not being allowed to move freely in Mumbai. He later took the train to Kolhapur from Mumbai. After his detention at Karad on Monday, Somaiya returned to his Mulund residence, welcomed by hordes of BJP supporters. “For the first time in independent India, the police have detained a person who was on his way to file a complaint against corruption,” said BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis. Sena MP Sanjay Raut said the Chief Minister’s office had nothing to do with it. “The home department must have felt there would be law and order issues so they took action. The Chief Minister’s office does not get involved in such small matters,” Raut said. Home minister Dilip Walse Patil also said the action was taken by the home department, controlled by the NCP. “Normally when such incidents happen, the home minister and CM are briefed by district authorities. I don’t know if in this case, the CM was briefed. However, this decision was taken by the home department,” said Walse Patil. Responding to Somaiya’s charge that the action had been taken at Sharad Pawar’s behest, Patil said there was no question of Pawar’s interference. Somaiya held a presser after his detention to sharpen his attack on Mushrif. “I have submitted specific evidence to the income-tax department, Enforcement Directorate and finance department against Mushrif. I have demanded criminal proceedings under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. Mushrif has floated several benami firms and has diverted huge funds,” Somaiya alleged. He alleged Mushrif and his son-in-law have purchased a cooperative sugar factory in Kolhapur district in a Rs 100 crore scam. Mushrif dismissed the charges as baseless and demanded an unconditional apology within 24 hours. He alleged state BJP chief Chandrakant Patil was the mastermind behind the “conspiracy.” “Patil had given me an offer to join BJP,” Mushrif alleged. Patil denied he was behind Somaiya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-somaiya-detained-on-way-to-kolhapur-to-file-graft-case/articleshow/86383127.cms||---

Some had to get help from people more adept with smartphones. Many unvaccinated people who tried to enter AMC offices or avail of public services at places such as BRTS and AMTS stands, were directed to vaccination booths nearby and only after that were they allowed to enter or buy tickets. The AMC on Friday announced that it would not allow unvaccinated people on public transport, at civic facilities and public establishments such as the zoo, Kankaria lakefront, Sabarmati riverfront, libraries, gymnasiums, swimming pools, sport complexes, city civic centres and all establishments operated by the AMC from Monday. Many people who already were vaccinated but could not furnish their certificates were turned away from AMTS and BRTS stands and had to travel by autorickshaws. This resulted into a fall in the fare collection for both these services. “I was asked to show a vaccine certificate when I tried to buy ticket for an AMTS bus. Fortunately, I keep it handy and was able to furnish it and could commute without a problem. However, an elderly couple did not have a smartphone or printouts of their vaccine certificates and they were told to get off the bus,” said a commuter at Ranip bus stand said. Security guards and officials of the civic body’s health department at the AMC office in Danapith carried out strict checking the entire day and many unvaccinated visitors or those who could not furnish certificates were told to take their first dose and were then allowed to enter. “By three in the afternoon, we sent around 200 unvaccinated people to the vaccination booth on the premises. They were only allowed entry after they showed us their certificate,” said an official checking visitor’s certificates at the AMC headquarters. The mayor, Kirit Parmar, and AMC standing committee chairman, Hitesh Barot, showed their vaccination certificates when they entered the main office on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/vaccine-passport-day-1-youth-sail-through-seniors-struggle/articleshow/86378976.cms||---

The woman approached Gotri police on Sunday night and filed a complaint against CA Ashok Jain and Raju Bhatt, alleging that had spiked her drink, raped her and then threatened to make her obscene photographs viral. The police said that the woman had joined Jain’s firm some time ago to get liaison training for which she was paid too. “The girl had to travel a long distance to reach the firm, so Jain helped her get a flat on rent in Diwalipura area,” a police official said. The complainant alleged that Jain took her to a guest house on Vasna Road a month ago and introduced her to Bhatt, who is an investor in his firm.  She alleged that Jain, who is in his 60s, spiked her drink and molested her at the guest house. He later went to her flat and allegedly raped her. After some days, Bhatt went to the woman’s flat and demanded physical relation. When she refused, Bhatt threatened her with dire consequences and then allegedly raped her, according to the FIR lodged.  “The woman said that on September 14, the accused sent her nude photos to her male friend and threatened to make them viral. They also threatened to kill her. The girl said that the accused had also set up spy cameras in her bedroom outside her knowledge,” the police added.  “We have registered a complaint against the duo who are yet to be arrested. Once they are arrested, we will be able to get more details of the crime,” said assistant commissioner of police (ACP) SV Rajgor. This is the second such complaint of rape registered in the city in the last four months. In June this year, a 19-year-old girl was gangraped by two of her colleagues Nazeem Mirza and Dishant Kahar at her residence. The duo had got the girl drunk and then forced themselves upon her. She narrated the ordeal to her father and a day later he committed suicide.

The tally in Mumbai remained at the usual 400-plus: 417 cases after 31,860 tests. “The daily test positivity rate has increased to 1.3% as fewer tests were done over the weekend,” said a BMC official. About 40,000 tests were conducted daily on an average last week. At the state-level too, 1.3 lakh tests were done. “It wasn’t only the weekend, but also Ganpati visarjan and people didn’t turn up for tests,’’ said a state official. Dr Pradeep Awate, who heads the state epidemiology cell, said there was still concern about the number of daily cases in Mumbai, Pune, Satara, Sangli and Ahmednagar districts. “However, our daily drill of locating hotspots in these districts and carrying out testing and treatment continues,” said Awate. In 2020, cases ballooned after the Ganpati festival and the public health machinery is bracing itself for another post-festival rise. “We expect a slight rise in cases due to the crowding, but it isn’t going to be a drastic hike,” added Awate. “We have to keep strict vigil as people who left the city for Ganpati festivities have returned. But it seems unlikely that cases will rise sharply in Mumbai,’’ said a BMC official. On Monday, the state’s daily Covid update showed 28 deaths, including five in Mumbai. The total case tally in Maharashtra since March 2020 stands at 65.2 lakh, including 7.4 lakh from Mumbai. The total toll in Maharashtra is 1.4 lakh, including 16,058 in Mumbai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/after-visarjan-weekend-maharashtra-state-cases-drop-to-7-month-low/articleshow/86381316.cms||---

Patel also met union health minister and Rajya Sabha MP from Gujarat Mansukh Mandaviya during his visit. The Prime Minister’s Office posted a picture of Patel’s meeting with Modi. The chief minister tweeted after meeting Shah, “Met Hon’ble Home Minister of India Shri Amit Shah ji in New Delhi. Gujarat is blessed to have received his continual guidance and support for the betterment of the State.” Patel, who replaced Vijay Rupani and was sworn in as chief minister on September 13, reached Delhi on Monday morning for the first time after becoming the CM. He informed PM Modi about the current situation in the state and discussed several issues of the state with him. After meeting Modi, various speculations regarding the brief the new CM might have got from Modi and Shah began doing the rounds of the power corridors. His courtesy meeting with President Kovind lasted for about 20 minutes. He then met Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu and Home Minister Amit Shah. Patel is a first-time MLA who directly became the CM. Earlier, from the BJP, Narendra Modi had become CM without contesting any elections and was subsequently elected MLA after being named CM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/patel-meets-prez-pm-during-visit-to-delhi/articleshow/86378951.cms||---
---||Delhi||Why parking plan for 16 colonies may pit residents against Delhi civic bodies||NEW DELHI: In September 2019, the Supreme Court had asked Delhi’s municipal corporations to regularise car parking in residential areas. The civic bodies came up with parking area management plans (PAMP), aimed at improving on-street and off-street parking while utilising road space for the convenience of vehicle owners. This has to be implemented with the help of the residents’ welfare associations under the Delhi Maintenance and Management of Parking Places Rules, 2019. And while South Delhi Municipal Corporation has submitted plans for 16 colonies to Delhi government’s transport department, the response of the citizens isn’t too enthusiastic. SDMC has sought public feedback on PAMP, but the response has been lukewarm at best, raising doubts about the parking plan implementation in the colonies, including Anand Lok, Geetanjali Enclave, Green Park Extension and Gulmohar Park. After the Supreme Court’s order of September 2019, PAMP were designed for Lajpat Nagar III in south Delhi, Krishna Nagar in east and Kamla Nagar in north as pilot projects. The parking situation in these localities hasn’t changed much. Civic officials also admitted that without subtle coercion accompanied with incentives, the plans cannot be implemented. “Unless we start charging fines or enforce the norms strictly and encourage people to park extra vehicles at identified parking sites (in and around colonies) to prevent congestion in the area, the situation won’t improve,” said Prem Shankar Jha, deputy commissioner (remunerative & project cell), SDMC. “The support of RWAs is a must because it is impossible to deploy staff in each neighbourhood to ensure parking at the earmarked sites. We will ensure things are improved in Lajpat Nagar III.” At Green Park, parking rates have been doubled so that, SDMC officials claim, people stop parking on roadsides and use the multi-level parking instead. “Besides the lack of residents’ cooperation, implementation and maintenance cost are other factors discouraging civic bodies from going ahead with the projects,” disclosed civic officials. Colony residents, however, argue that they pay a road use fee when purchasing vehicles and penalising vehicles without providing them adequate infrastructure is not a good idea. S B Singh, president, Lajpat Nagar III RWA, alleged that SDMC hasn’t contacted the RWA on this matter for a year. “It’s unfair to blame residents when the authorities are not working proactively,” said Singh. “Our RWA members are active and despite the resistance to parking at a distance from homes, we are ready to extend our support to PAMP.” Talking about the intention to revive PAMP in Kamla Nagar, North Delhi Municipal Corporation commissioner Sanjay Goel said it required a big investment. “We need around Rs 38 crore to implement the plan and we have communicated this to the urban development department two or three times and to the lieutenant governor without receiving a response,” claimed Goel. “Funds are necessary to enhance walkability, landscaping, bollards, beautification, etc.” A municipal officer explained, “The basic arrangements made by the civic body are back to square one because the Kamla Nagar market traders’ association didn’t want to give up parking near their shops and only responded tepidly to the idea.” Nitin Gupta, president, Kamla Nagar Market Association, said businesses began resisting the plan when the north corporation demarcated space for hawkers in front of shops without consulting the shop owners. “Also, the only multi-level parking in the market does not meet the parking requirement of the area. At least 2,000 two-wheelers come to the market while the parking has space for 100 two-wheelers at most,” said Gupta. “The four-wheeler space is partly used and the rest is used by visitors. The corporation erected bollards on busy roads for pedestrians and unfairly turned some roads into no parking zones.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-parking-plan-for-16-colonies-may-pit-residents-against-corpn/articleshow/86378897.cms||Vibha Sharma

The criticism has prompted the cricket association of Uttarakhand (CAU) to form a panel to look into the matter. A trial match, for the selection of the district’s U-25 team, was held on a tiled pitch, the players complained. They said the trial camp was wound down in haste as they were given only one day instead of two. In an email written to the CAU officials, the players alleged that the incompetent handling of the trial camp by the district association didn’t give them a fair chance to make it to the U-25 team. Several complaints in the past have been registered against the Pauri district association for poor handling of cricketing events.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/trial-match-held-on-tiled-pitch-players-cry-foul/articleshow/86378893.cms||Mohammad Anab

Speaking to reporters at his residence in Kanichukulangara in Alappuzha district on Monday, Natesan said that there is no holy war in the name of narcotics and the word jihad should not be linked to this. He said that the most number of religious conversions are made by the Christian community. The Christian missionaries are exploiting the poverty of people for making religious conversions, he said. Speaking about the priest, who claimed that Ezhava youngsters are also involved in targeting those belonging to the Christian community, Natesan said that the priest should have got himself defrocked before apologising for his venomous remarks.

---||Delhi||Court raps employee for bail bond lapses in three NE Delhi riot cases||New Delhi: A court has pulled up one of its staff for not reporting bail bonds of a few accused in three northeast Delhi riot cases even after being informed that they have been submitted by the jail superintendents concerned.It directed the staffer to submit an explanation within two days, failing which the court would report the matter to the district judge with a request for appropriate action against him.Early in the day, the court was informed by the staffer that the cases could not be committed to the sessions court as bail bonds of some of the accused had not been received yet. In these matters, cognisance has been taken for the offence under Section 436 (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to destroy house, etc) of the Indian Penal Code, which is exclusively triable by a sessions court.The staffer, the ahlmad of the court, claimed that he had not yet received the bail bonds from the jail officials. But it came to light later that the reports had already been received from the courts of all metropolitan magistrates of Northeast district, following which the jail superintendents concerned have sent the bail bonds to the ahlmad.The ahlmad also sent a report, dated March 29, 2021, received from the jail superintendent of Mandoli Jail 12 stating that the original bail bonds of two of the accused in the cases had been sent by him to the court of duty magistrate and the copy of personal bond of one of them was also attached with the report.“An explanation be accordingly called from the ahlmad as to why he had not taken steps for obtaining the bail bonds of the accused, Vijay and Pappu, from the court of the duty metropolitan magistrate concerned even after receipt of the report dated 29.03.21 till date, if he had not received the same earlier,” chief metropolitan magistrate Arun Kumar Garg said in his order.Earlier in the day, the court had passed stern remarks against director general (prisons) and the Mandoli Jail superintendents for allegedly failing to send all the bail bonds/release warrants of all the accused, who have been in custody in these riots cases, despite repeated orders. It had noted that this failure had led to avoidable delay in committal/trial of all the matters pertaining to the communal violence.As per the court’s order, it came to light later that the jail superintendents concerned had submitted the reports but the court staffer had allegedly given false information.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-raps-employee-for-bail-bond-lapses-in-three-ne-delhi-riot-cases/articleshow/86378946.cms||---

The greatest dip in ticket revenue was for the BRTS, which fell to Rs 9.20 lakh on Monday against the figure for the previous Monday of Rs 13 lakh. Ticket sales for the BRTS fell by more than 30% on Monday, as compared to September 13. Sources in the BRTs said that on Monday, the number of passengers who used the BRTS was just 70,000 against 1.10 lakh on September 13, a 36% fall. Officials said the drop was considerable, as the BRTS enforced strict compliance with AMC’s rule of no entry without vaccination. The officials said that at several stations with substantial footfalls, BRTS authorities had ensured there was a team present vaccinating people. Those who were not vaccinated were not allowed to board buses. Similarly, the drop in revenue for the AMTS was over Rs 2 lakh. The AMTS ticket revenue was about Rs 15 lakh against the daily average of Rs 17 lakh. AMTS officials said there are just 550 buses on the road against a peak of 700 earlier. These officials said the drop in the revenue was also due to the heavy rain across the city on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bus-ticket-collections-fall-by-rs-6-lakh/articleshow/86379053.cms||---
---||Delhi||Oil cos in SC as SDMC seeks fee from petrol pumps for hoardings||New Delhi: Government-owned oil companies have rushed to the Supreme Court with a unique problem — BJP-led local bodies of Delhi are demanding fees from them for putting up hoardings at petrol pumps, advertising Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s messages on the success of the Ujjwala scheme, swift switch to cleaner BS-VI fuel and the country’s fight against Covid-19. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta on Monday said there has been some misunderstanding of the rules and regulations which has led to the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) demanding fees on advertisement hoardings that convey the government’s policies and its achievements to the general public. When he requested urgent listing of the application filed jointly by Indian Oil, Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum, a bench headed by CJI N V Ramana said he will soon constitute a green bench to deal with many pending matters in regard to environment and forests. The problem is politically interesting as the municipal corporations/council — South Delhi, New Delhi, North Delhi and East Delhi — are all ruled by BJP, which is the party in power at the Centre that controls the oil companies. The oil companies have been for years prominently displaying the PM’s messages on advertisement hoardings erected on the premises of retail fuel outlets. But the cash-strapped local bodies are eyeing to increase their revenues by charging a fee on the hoardings, terming them as advertisements liable to municipal levies under the Delhi Outdoor Advertisement Policy, which was formulated under the supervision of the Supreme Court during the hearing of a case before its green bench. The oil companies said SDMC has asked them to pay up the fees for “having not taken permission for display of hoardings/logo/self-signages/branding at petrol pumps/depots”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/oil-cos-in-sc-as-sdmc-seeks-fee-from-petrol-pumps-for-hoardings/articleshow/86378969.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

Large component manufacturers said the focus on electric vehicles in the scheme would incentivize them to invest in new technologies, especially with other subsidies announced under FAME. “The government must next focus on upskilling the workforce for the EV market,” KV Suresh, president of the components manufacturer ZF India, said. However, MSMEs, which are key to the automotive sector supply chain, said longstanding issues should have be addressed first. “The issues were exacerbated due to the pandemic.

---||Goa||Living with Alzheimers: When daily tasks become a battle for distraught families||PANAJI: The first time 76-year-old Maria Vaz (name changed) walked out from her home in Curtorim, her family thought nothing of it. When a neighbour brought her back home on a scooter, Vaz nonchalantly thanked the man, walked into the living room, and continued a conversation as if nothing happened. For weeks, nothing changed, until one Friday morning, she woke up, saw her husband with whom she had spent four decades, and let out a string of abuses. “To her, I was a total stranger. She asked me how I got into her bed. I was confused,” said her husband, Jerome. The commotion woke up the entire household, including the couple’s two sons and the househelp. From that day onwards, nothing made sense. “My mother was with us, but the lady who brought me up had gone,” said her son Sebastian, a computer engineer. Scenes like these are repeated every day across India. Once diagnosed, the family members realise that Alzheimer’s is a progressive degenerative condition that cannot be reversed. Doctors and scientists say that the disease causes brain cells to atrophy, which in turn causes everything from loss of memory and comprehension to disorientation and erratic behaviour. In India, with increased life expectancy and an aging population, it is estimated that over 5.3 million people live with dementia, of which Alzheimer’s is the most common cause. This figure is set to rise to 7.6 million in 2030, according to the Dementia in India Report 2020, published by the Alzheimer’s and Related Disorders Society of India (ARDSI). While the causes of Alzheimer's is unknown, the greatest-known risk factor is age, and the majority of people with Alzheimer's are 65 and older. In India, Goa has the second-highest proportion of senior citizens, with 11.2% being over 60, many with little to no support. As the person moves through the stages of Alzheimer’s, he or she will need more care as symptoms get worse. The medicines used to treat Alzheimer’s disease can only control symptoms; if detected early, proper medication can delay the onset of severe symptoms. People living with dementia are forced to rely on family for their care because of a lack of trained support and resources. “It is very difficult to get caregivers or nurses who understand the nuances of dementia,” said Shristi Gaitonde. “The only way to get a good nurse who can care for a person with Alzheimer’s is to approach nurses from Kerala. In the first few years, I used to feel mentally burnt out because of the stubborn nature. My mother-in-law would refuse to eat, would suddenly walk out of the house, give away things without asking...” The lack of a support system in India is a key challenge for families and caregivers, who often find themselves burnt out, questioning reality, and wondering who the stranger living under their roof is. Another challenge, say doctors, is the failure to detect the condition on time. Thousands of cases go undetected, and the elderly suffer at the hands of family and society because their condition is misunderstood and attributed to “going mad”. The stigma attached to the behavioural problems that accompany Alzheimer’s prompt many families to hide the person or prevent guests from coming over. According to many caregivers, building a local and robust support system is a key to address the challenges. The support system should include a caregiver support group, family, friends, and religious groups. “It is mentally taxing because you have to be alert and end up being tensed up at all times. They can do weird things while guests come over, so that becomes another stress factor. Some people don’t want others to know that there is an Alzheimer’s patient at home,” said Gaitonde. Daily activities such as brushing teeth, dressing, eating, and communicating may become a challenge and a cause for friction, which often leaves the person’s loved ones distraught. “Everyday is a surprise. You never know what will trigger some memory or a temper tantrum,” explains Radhika, who looks after her mother with dementia. “It started with arguments regarding leaving the tap on, and progressed to a war of words. It is exhausting, both physically and emotionally.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/living-with-alzheimers-when-daily-tasks-become-a-battle-for-distraught-families/articleshow/86381206.cms||Newton Sequeira
---||Pune||MCCIA to launch workshop on EVs with focus on safety||Pune: The Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industry, and Agriculture (MCCIA) will launch a training programme for capacity building in electric vehicles, with emphasis on current business environments, future expectations, and safety measures. The programme is aimed at industry players and educational institutions. EV experts have long called for increased capacity building among students, industry players, and others; for more dissemination of prevailing standards in car bodies, powertrains, and other inputs; regulatory and policy framework; and the schemes available. The need for awareness of safety standards has become relevant after last week’s fire completely gutted a Bavdhan Budruk warehouse, with investigations pointing to a short circuit at an electric vehicle charging station on the premises. The course, designed by current and former auto industry veterans and experts, will focus on technology trends in the EV business, powertrain, and transmissions such as hybrid technology, as well as batteries and battery management system (BMS), the latter being crucial to ensure battery and charging equipment safety “Since EVs are coming up in a big way, and Pune is an auto hub, we need to track this trend for the good of the industry. Infrastructure for EVs is also very important , and so is health and safety,” said Prashant Girbane, the director of MCCIA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mccia-to-launch-workshop-on-evs-with-focus-on-safety/articleshow/86378933.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

Am I still protected against the infection?” Doubts of this sort are sending people, including healthcare workers, rushing to pathology labs. Some of them insist on antibody tests to learn of their immunity status. Dr Arvind Lal, chairman and managing director, Dr Lal Path Labs, told TOI that his chain of diagnostic laboratories gets close to 400 such requests daily. Dr Navin Dang, founder and chairman, Dr Dang’s Lab, similarly said they get 20 to 30 requests for antibody tests from fully vaccinated persons every day. At Apollo Hospital, group medical director Dr Anupam Sibal said numerous people sent queries about what the results of their antibody tests mean. “If the antibody levels are low, they go into a panic,” Sibal said. Antibody tests, also called serology tests, look for antibodies in a blood sample to determine whether a person has had a previous infection. These are of two types: the qualitative one, which tells whether a person has antibodies against the virus or not, and the quantitative one which quantifies the antibody titres in the body. People mostly opt for the second one, the quantitative test, according to labs. Different labs use different reference values to give the result of the antibody test. However, some of the labs claim that if the result is more than five times the reference value, say 67 units against a reference value of 12 units, it suggests good antibody levels. “If the result is two to five times the reference value, it is suggestive of partial levels of antibody and anything less than two times the reference value is considered low,” said one diagnostic executive. Dr Jamal Yusuf, professor of cardiology at G B Pant Hospital, said many healthcare workers in that hospital have been found to have low antibody levels. “The antibodies wane over a period of time. This is why some of the countries have already started giving booster Covid doses,” Yusuf said. According to Dr S K Sarin, vice-chancellor, Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, Vasant Kunj, 15-20% of the fully vaccinated people do not develop the desired levels of antibodies. “It is also true that the antibodies produced by vaccination wane over a period of time, say four to six months. But that does not mean that vaccines aren’t effective. We do not know for sure if the waning of antibodies levels makes a person vulnerable to infection as the T cell response of the vaccine remains effective for a long time,” he explained. Apollo Hospital’s Dr Anupam Sibal said low antibody titres result doesn’t mean that the body will not mount an immune response when challenged by the coronavirus because humans have memory B cells and T cells that get activated and help fight the virus. The World Health Organization, US Food and Drug Administration and the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention have also advised against routine antibody testing to assess the protection from vaccines against Covid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/antibody-tests-post-vax-may-not-tell-the-full-story/articleshow/86378925.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha
---||Bhopal||The mental health cost of coronavirus||BHOPAL: Two waves of Covid-19 have adversely affected the lives of people. There are many who have lost their close family members while others have suffered losses in business or lost their jobs or faced pay cuts; all these factors have impacted the lifestyle and mental peace of people, drastically. As per police data, 485 suicide cases were reported in the city in 2020 - almost 18 %t more than suicide cases reported in 2019 when 412 suicides were reported. The figure continues to rise this year; 324 suicide cases have already been reported till September 15. In a harrowing incident reported in Misrod recently, a 56-year-old unemployed civil engineer and his wife consumed poison at their flat in Sahara Estate Colony. The engineer then slit the throat of their 16-year-old son and 14-year-old daughter with an electric floor-tiles cutter machine while they were sleeping. Police recovered a suicide note written by the deceased, wherein he stated that he had lost his job in second Covid-19 wave and couldn’t even pay school fee of his children for past two years. In another case, a 35-year-old man slit his throat with a kitchen knife in Jehangirabad on September 1, after his family members including wife and sister tried to counsel him to search for a job. The deceased worked in an ice-cream factory and lost his job after Corona curfew. Consultant psychiatrist Dr Satyakant Trivedi said, there is an immediate need to formulate and implement suicide prevention policy. There are three main cause which trigger suicidal thoughts in people - mental or psychological causes, financial causes and social causes. Focus should be on these factors if we want to prevent suicides. Post Covid-19 people are going through various traumas as some lost their near and dear ones, some lost their jobs, some suffered loss in their business and are going through financial crisis. He said, for prevention of suicides, people should be told not to lose hope in any situation and the tough time will pass . “Speak to your near and dear ones. Take professional help from counsellors if needed. If people are going through financial problem,s they should seek help. In case of a sleep disorder or depression, never take intoxicants as cure,” he added. Dr Trivedi said, people should always look for warning signs in their near and dear ones. Those who are vulnerable include people who are isolated, those whose financial status has changed suddenly, those suffering from chronic illness/pain, those who lost their close family members and also those who have past history of inflicting selfharm. Suicide is preventable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/infections-down-but-covid-effect-remains-financial-mental-issues-push-up-suicide-rate/articleshow/86378931.cms||Sudeept Mishra

The south corporation is the nodal agency for tabulating data related to vector-borne diseases in the city. Civic bodies claimed to have made their dengue/malaria testing clinics fully operational and called back staff deployed at vaccination centres to help hospitals or polyclinics earlier. “The fever clinics, which are located in every colony, are taking blood slides for testing of malaria. In south Delhi, we have 27 fever clinics under the public health department. Also, there are 14 serology centres for conducting blood tests in people having symptoms of dengue and chikungunya. Doctors at the centres usually advise those with high fever, other symptoms to go for the tests,” said an SDMC official. In east Delhi, there are four fever clinics in two zones. “All precautions are being taken to check the spread of vector-borne diseases in border areas,” said an east corporation official.

Addressing media persons at Thunchan Parambu in Tirur on Monday, he said that it was the real issues raised by Pala bishop that should be discussed at the meeting. “What Pala bishop said is the basic issue and not what people said about it. The government should be ready to discuss it... It should be the chief minister and not KPCC president K Sudhakaran who should convene a meeting of religious and community leaders,” he said. Surendran asked what the stand of the CPM and Congress was on the serious issues of ‘love jihad’ and ‘narcotic jihad’. “The most important thing is how we are addressing an issue. But what is going on in the state now is how to get away from an issue by concealing it,” he added. The BJP leader said that both LDF and UDF were trying to exploit the issue. “Both the fronts know very well that if the real issue is discussed then they will burn their fingers,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/discuss-issues-raised-by-pala-bishop-bjp/articleshow/86381324.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Inmates again clash at Tihar Jail, two injured||NEW DELHI: Another clash was reported from Tihar Jail on Saturday. Two undertrial prisoners attacked each other with sharp objects and one of them received multiple injuries. A case has been registered in this regard. A jail official said the investigation revealed that the sharp objects were made of utensils. The condition of one of the prisoners who was taken to a hospital for treatment is stable. “Both the undertrial prisoners were involved in several criminal cases and were arrested many times earlier. We suspect personal enmity and dominance as reasons behind the fight,” the official further said. A Delhi Police officer said they received information on Saturday that the seriously injured undertrial prisoner, Shamim, was admitted to the hospital. Further investigation in the case revealed that he was stabbed by another prisoner named Pramod, who had sustained minor injuries. “On Monday, we recorded the statement of Shamim and a case under Section 307 of the Indian Penal Code was registered,” the officer said. Tihar officials claim that to curb such incidents, they regularly conduct raids in the cells and recover prohibited items. “Around 7,000 CCTV cameras have been installed to keep tabs on activities of the prisoners,” the official added. This is the fifth such incident reported from Tihar Jail in about a month. On September 11, two inmates were injured in a clash. The very next day, Vikas Dhull was attacked by another inmate Vikas Chopra by using a surgical blade. On September 13, a 28-year-old undertrial prisoner was attacked by another inmate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/inmates-again-clash-at-tihar-jail-two-injured/articleshow/86378996.cms||---
---||Vadodara||Nesting & breeding: Sparrows take to ‘new houses’||VADODARA: While artificial houses for sparrows — that have become a rare sight in most parts of the city — are distributed and installed regularly, for the first-time details have been gathered about the bird using and even breeding in them. The hatchlings in many cases have grown into birds and occupied other houses. The effort of distributing the houses for sparrows was started by Star India last year. The organization encourages people to join the initiative and also provides them with houses, feeders, bags of feed for sparrows. Architect Tanuj Desai who started the project said that apart from members, the organization has also provided the sparrow houses and other material at 53 public places or offices. These include police stations, municipal corporation facilities and other places. “We have more than 400 members now and around 450 kits, with 22 items including houses and feeders, have been installed so far. An additional 1,000 cardboard houses were distributed on World Sparrow Day,” he said. Desai informed that 166 hatchlings were born in the houses installed by the organization. “They occupied other houses or flew away,” said Desai. Over 370 houses already have sparrows nesting in them. Ajay Patel, a businessman who had installed four artificial houses, said that two of them were occupied by the sparrows. “Two hatchlings were born in one of the houses. They grew up and flew away. Other small birds have also started coming to eat from the feeders,” he said. For many, the sparrow houses and feeders brought back childhood memories. “As children, we had seen sparrows even in the Ghadiyali Pole and used to feed them and other birds. We now stay in Diwalipura. While our sparrow house is yet to be occupied, several small birds come to eat from the feeders,” said Pragnesh Shah, a financial investment consultant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/nesting-breeding-sparrows-take-to-new-houses/articleshow/86376620.cms||Sachin Sharma
---||Goa||Goa: Jennifer Monserrate stays order upholding river dept claim to prime land||PANAJI: Revenue minister Jennifer Monserrate has stayed an order by the deputy collector that upheld the river navigation department’s ownership of a plot of land in Dona Paula that has been subject of a four decade-long tussle. On June 24, the deputy collector had rejected the Goa yachting association’s (GYA) claim on the land, which is approximately 250 sq m. Now, the river navigation department (RND) has turned to the advocate general for legal opinion regarding Monserrate’s stand. Government sources said that Monserrate’s action has resulted in “allowing government property to be utilised by a private party” for financial gain. After the order in June, the GYA appealed to Monserrate, seeking a review of the case. On August 25, Monserrate said that the verdict was “against the principles of natural justice” as the SDM had “not decided the case on merits”. Monserrate’s order has perplexed government officials, who are wondering why the state government is not keen on recovering prime government property from the GYA, which has been using the land “illegally for commercial purposes”. A note put up to the AG’s office has said that the advocate general “should decide whether the decision of the revenue minister staying the order of the deputy collector of conforming the title of RND without giving an opportunity to RND is illegal”. The tussle for the prime land is yet another example where one government department is not protecting another government department’s interests, said a government official. Interestingly, RTI documents show that in a note on July 29, Monserrate had warned that the proposed Goa Bhumiputra Adhikarini Bill could prompt those occupying government land to claim right over the properties. The GYA claims that the land was handed over by the Indian Navy in August 1974, and that the plot has been used for sailing since 1974. In 1989, the deputy collector’s office decided that the title of the land vests with the RND. Documents show that the case has been shuttling between the revenue department and river navigation department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/jennifer-stays-order-upholding-river-dept-claim-to-prime-land/articleshow/86381247.cms||Newton Sequeira

The last date for the submission has been extended till December 31, 2021, to provide relief to developers amid the disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Real estate developers are required to submit the annual report on statement of accounts in Form-5 within six months after the end of every fiscal year for every registered project. The Covid-19 pandemic and the country-wide lockdown as well as restrictions halted all activities in the real estate sector, the state real estate regulator said in its recent order. It added that various other statutory bodies such as CBDT (Central Board of Direct Taxes) have extended the due date for the submission of annual compliances. Providing a relaxation in the due date of the statutory compliance will give relief to promoters. “The last date for the submission of Form-5 for the financial year 2020-21 which is due on 30th September 2021, is extended up to 31st December 2021,” Gujarat RERA said in its order.“Promoters and chartered accountants are required to comply with the requirement of submission of Form-5 by the revised time period,” the state authority added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujrera-extends-deadline-to-file-annual-report/articleshow/86379008.cms||---
---||Delhi||Fate of unapproved corridors of Delhi Metro's Phase-IV remains uncertain||NEW DELHI: While Covid-19 has slowed down the pace of construction of the three priority corridors of Delhi Metro’s Phase-IV expansion, the fate of the unapproved ones — Rithala-Bawana-Narela (22km), Lajpat Nagar-Saket G-Block (7.9km) and Inderlok-Indraprastha (12.6km) — seems uncertain. Even before construction work of Delhi Metro Rail Corporation’s (DMRC) much-delayed Phase-IV project could gather pace, the pandemic brought it to a halt. The second wave and the evolving scenario is likely to make it miss its 2025 completion target too. While work on all three corridors — Janakpuri West-RK Ashram (28.9km), Aerocity-Tughlaqabad (20.2km) and Maujpur-Majlis Park (12.5km) — is going on simultaneously, Maujpur-Majlis Park corridor, an extension of Pink Line is expected to be completed first. The Rithala-Bawana-Narela corridor, an extension of Red Line, is the longest one awaiting approval. While DMRC plans to construct the capital’s first Metrolite corridor on this route, the other two would have conventional high-capacity corridors. Delhi government had given its final approval to all the six proposed corridors in December 2018. But the Centre only approved three priority corridors in February 2019. The proposal was then tweaked to include an affordable Metrolite corridor on Rithala-Narela route and funding pattern was also changed. The revised proposal was again sent to Delhi government for approval. Transport minister Kailash Gahlot told TOI that Delhi government had approved all six corridors, but a proposal was sent again with changes, including alignment. “The proposal is being examined and will be put before the cabinet as early as possible,” Gahlot added. The Rithala-Narela corridor is not expected to witness heavy passenger traffic, which is why a Metrolite corridor has been found more viable there. The Lajpat Nagar-Saket G-Block corridor, the shortest corridor in the Phase-IV project, would serve as a link between the existing Magenta (Botanical Garden-Janakpuri West) and Pink Lines and the upcoming Tughlaqabad-Aerocity corridor. The Inderlok-Indraprastha corridor would directly connect north with central Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/fate-of-unapproved-corridors-of-metro-ph-iv-remains-uncertain/articleshow/86378980.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Your survey should clearly say that these are the street vendors who are sitting in hawking zone and these are the ones who are in the no-hawking or no vending zone,” the HC bench stated.It asked the authorities to file their replies to the plea and listed the matter for November 10. The high court also asked the north corporation to place on record the scheme relating to no-hawking and no-squatting areas.The traders association had submitted that despite the high court repeatedly ordering that in no hawking zones, there shall not be any encroachment, hawkers and vendors were present with the TVC also conducting a survey.The association claimed that as far as installation of 330 CCTV cameras in the entire area was concerned, despite the high court’s direction, not even a single CCTV camera had been installed till date.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/explain-vendors-presence-in-no-hawking-zone-hc/articleshow/86379029.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

He was posted at GRP Kanpur and had come to Prayagraj on escort duty on Ajmer-Sealdah Express train. No suicide note was recovered from him. The reason behind the deceased taking the extreme step is still unknown. The body has been sent for post mortem, police said. The incident, according to the police, took place at around 9:40 am when some policemen in the GRP police line heard two gunshots and ran towards the toilet. On reaching there, they spotted the head constable, identified as Chintamani Yadav, a resident of Manda in Prayagraj, lying in a pool of blood. They rushed him to a hospital where the doctors pronounced him dead. Deputy SP (GRP) Amit Srivastava said, “The deceased head constable, posted at GRP Kanpur, had come to Prayagraj on Sunday as he was assigned escort duty in Ajmer-Sealdah Express train. He had to return to Kanpur on Monday on escort duty in the same train. He was staying in barrack number two of the GRP Prayagraj police line.” Police said that Yadav had joined the police force in 2005 as a constable. Reports said the policemen at GRP police line were shocked when they heard two gunshots and spotted the head constable in a critical condition. They arranged a vehicle to take the critically injured head constable to a hospital. A bullet had reportedly pierced the head of the deceased. Upon receiving information, senior GRP police authorities also rushed to the spot and carried out investigations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/grp-head-constable-shootshimself-with-service-weapon/articleshow/86380503.cms||---

---||Goa||Goa: Enrolment for Classes I-VII dipped by 3,000 in pandemic year||PANAJI: School enrolment from Classes I to VII dropped by around 3,000 during the academic year 2020-21, which was the first school year after the Covid-19 pandemic hit. From Classes I to IV, enrolment was down by over 2,700 since the previous academic year 2019-20, and students studying from Classes V to VII reduced by 512, as per the directorate of education’s (DoE) educational statistics at a glance for the year. After the first lockdown was imposed in 2020 to control the spread of Covid-19, the state saw an exodus of migrants employed in Goa. This could be one contributing factor to the sudden drop in enrolment during the year 2020-21. However, it appears from the figures that a general fear of the pandemic could also have kept students across various sections of society from entering the school system, as the biggest drop was seen in new enrolments that take place at the Class I level. The number of students registering for Class I came down by as many as 2,285 students in 2020-21 over the previous year. In 2020-21, 895 fewer girls and 1,390 fewer boys entered the school system at Class I. Also, the enrolment in schools show a dip at the primary school level from Classes I to IV across institutes runs by different managements — government, aided and private. From Class V to VII, on the other hand, some of the loss in enrolment of private schools appears to result in a minor gain for aided institutions. This was presumably due to parents’ reduced spending power, leading them to prefer the affordable fee structure of government-aided schools. However, the DoE data also shows an unexplained increase in enrolment by around 1,700 students from Class VIII to X in 2020-21 as against 2019-20. Most of the gain in students last year at this level is shown at the Class X level, indicating that many could have returned to school to complete their schooling. This gain in numbers at Class X level has kept the overall school enrolment from Class I to X in Goa from dipping massively despite reduced enrolment in the lower classes. The total number of students in school in 2020-21 in Goa was 2,38,927, as compared to 2,40,450 recorded in 2019-20.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/enrolment-for-classes-i-vii-dipped-by-3k-in-pandemic-yr/articleshow/86381297.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

The HC directions came in response to a PIL filed by an NGO Samta Sainik Dal, which listed 78 families whose properties were damaged during the cyclone on May 17, and demanded inclusion of their names in the affected families and give them compensation after assessing the damages these families had sustained. These families are located in Bhavnagar, Amreli, Gir-Somnath and Junagadh districts. Petitioner’s advocate Hemant Makwana had submitted that teams of surveyors visited the villages, but the names of several affected persons did not find a mention in the list of the victims who are to be compensated by the government. On the accusation of discrimination by the petitioner NGO, the bench headed by acting Chief Justice R M Chhaya said, “The authorities will take into consideration the eligibility criteria of each of such persons and implement the policy decisions taken vide notifications…” The court has also directed the authorities to consider the representation by the NGO and “ensure that each and every person affected by Tauktae cyclone be given benefits of Government Resolutions dated March 18,2021, May 23, 2021 and May 24, 2021.” Besides seeking inclusion of these 78 families for compensation, the PIL had also sought directions to concerned authorities to identify the real affected families on account of cyclone Tauktae and allow them to produce evidence before district collectors and to ensure that their names are forwarded to the relief commissioner for benefit of compensation in proportion to the damage caused. The central government had announced a relief package of Rs 1,000 crore immediately after the cyclone hit the Saurashtra coast. The state government also declared a package and fixed an amount for compensation towards property damages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ensure-all-tauktae-affected-get-compensation-hc/articleshow/86379027.cms||---

The inspection was initiated in the wake of a recent incident in which the corporation suspended a staff for alleged irregularity in tax collection. Mayor Arya Rajendran said that accounts officer has been instructed to ensure proper upkeep of registers and files. She said that the audit department has also begun scrutiny of files in zonal offices. In July, the corporation had suspended a revenue staff for irregularities in handling tax collection amount. An office attendant was placed under suspension for failure in remitting the amount collected as tax promptly in the bank. He was also found to have committed forgery by furnishing a fake counter foil to mislead the supervising official that the amount was promptly deposited within the bank. The fraud came to light after the revenue inspector cross verified it with the bank statement, which showed that an amount of around Rs 1.5 lakh was missing in the statement. When questioned again, the office attendant admitted to have committed the fraud. The matter was soon taken up with the secretary who suspended him and also filed a complaint with the police for forgery. It has also been forwarded to local fund audit for further action. Two years ago, the performance audit wing had found out during the inspection that three bill collectors had delayed in depositing the amount collected as tax with the city corporation and that the revenue inspectors who were supposed to monitor the collection and remittance failed to ensure prompt deposit of collection. Six officials with the revenue wing of the corporation faced suspension following the performance audit report regarding mismanagement of money collected as tax amount from city residents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/special-teams-to-conduct-checks-in-zonal-offices/articleshow/86376647.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Over 800 trees may have to go for revamped New Delhi railway station||NEW DELHI: Over 800 trees are expected to be felled or transplanted for the New Delhi railway station redevelopment project, which is currently awaiting clearance from the forest and wildlife department. In the first week of September, lieutenant governor Anil Baijal had directed agencies to expedite all clearances for the project, but forest officials said a fresh submission would have to be made as the total number of trees had been miscounted during the first submission. Based on the fresh submission to be made by next week, the forest department would assess whether the proposal would require clearance under Delhi Preservation of Trees Act, 1994 or the more-stringent Forest Conservation Act, 1980. A senior forest official from the west division said three patches would be impacted. Inspections done in the past showed trees had not been counted properly. The executing body for the project, Rail Land Development Authority (RLDA), was asked to submit a fresh proposal with the exact number of trees that would be affected. “Each forest patch was numbered and we asked them to rectify the count and submit it again. However, it is estimated that 800-1,000 trees will be impacted. Once the submission is made, a fresh inspection will be done to determine whether it is a deemed forest or not,” said the official. The forest department considers an area a “deemed forest” if it has more than 250 trees per hectare. Subsequently, permission has to be taken from the Centre under Forest Conservation Act to fell trees. After inspection, the department would determine the number of trees that would be transplanted. “Each agency has been asked to expedite work and once we receive a fresh count, we can inspect these three forest patches and give the necessary clearance,” said the official. In the meeting held in the first week of September, Baijal discussed the project with CEO of Niti Aayog Amitabh Kant, Delhi chief secretary Vijay Dev, DDA vice-chairman Anurag Jain and the RLDA VC, along with senior officials from stakeholder organisations. The LG asked the agencies to ensure clearances were given in a timely manner so that the project timeline could be adhered to. At present, nine private companies have been shortlisted and a Request for Proposal would have to be submitted by October. The station is being redeveloped on the transit-oriented development policy. It would be built on world-class standards, consisting of dome-shaped terminal buildings with separate arrivals and departures. There would be 40-floor twin towers with retail and office space, apart from a pedestrian boulevard with high-end shopping outlets.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/over-800-trees-may-have-to-go-for-revamped-ndls/articleshow/86379019.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

Owaisi was told by the jail authorities that the meeting could not be allowed because of Covid-19 protocols. Besides, Owaisi was told, he was not a family member or lawyer of Ahmed. Earlier this month, Ahmed had pledged his support to the AIMIM.  Later, speaking to mediapersons, Owaisi said that the AIMIM will contest the 2022 assembly election with full force. “We are here to contest elections with all our might. It is not our concern at whose cost we make our political gain,” Owaisi said in reply to a question about the Congress alleging that the AIMIM is the BJP’s B-team. “The state unit will decide how many seats the AIMIM will be in a position to contest in the next year’s election,” he said. Owaisi, however, made it clear that his party will not contest only on the seats where Muslims have a sizable presence. “We will also contest on Hindu-majority seats as we have to get the votes of all (and not just Muslims),” he said. According to party insiders, the AIMIM could field candidates for up to 80 assembly seats. The AIMIM chief met Congress municipal councillor Shehzad Khan, and said he did so as Khan had worked hard during the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC). Rubbishing the allegations made by the Congress that the AIMIM works as the B-team of the BJP, Owaisi asked why there are only three Muslim MLAs in Gujarat. He said there should have been at least 10 to 11 Muslim MLAs in the state assembly. “Can the Congress explain why it gets repeatedly defeated in Gujarat? Is it because of Muslim or non-Muslim votes?” he asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/here-to-win-at-whose-cost-not-our-concern-owaisi/articleshow/86379095.cms||---

SHRC said that the delay in project completion was denial of justice to the fisherfolk community. SHRC chairman Antony Dominic in his order said that steps shall be taken to avoid the delay. The state government had entrusted Kerala state coastal area development corporation (KSCADC) with the construction of 32 flats. The work on eight flats has been completed. St Antony’s Public School has donated 27.345 cents of land for the construction of the remaining 24 flats. However, the land was found to be unideal for the construction of flats. KSCADC has communicated to SHRC that work on the remaining flats could be completed only after receiving seven cents of land. The government has not taken a decision on handing over the land. The amount is also due from the department of fisheries, which has resulted in the delay. Fisheries director has informed the commission that it was decided to construct flats on 294 cents of land at Muttathara village in Valiyathura and fishermen families can be rehabilitated here. St Antony’s School principal however informed the SHRC that KSCADC had told that the land handed over for flat construction was ideal for the work. SHRC said that it would not intervene in the matters regarding transfer of land. However, it was unjust on the part of authorities to delay the construction of flats. SHRC directed the chief secretary and managing director of KSCADC to rehabilitate the beneficiaries as soon as possible.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/shrc-slams-officials-for-project-delay/articleshow/86376695.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The corporation intends to complete the task by mid-December, it told the court. After being nudged earlier by the apex court to expedite the process, Haryana additional advocate general Arun Bhardwaj informed a bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar and Dinesh Maheshwari that the corporation had received applications from 2,391 families for rehabilitation, out of which 892 were prima facie eligible, and provisional allotment letters had been issued to 302 families. He said that the last date of filing of applications is November 15 and the draw of lots will be held on December 2. The bench, while noting that modalities suggested by it earlier regarding provisional allotment of houses are being rolled out by the corporation in right earnest, told Bhardwaj that civic body will have to furnish details of structures which have not been demolished and are standing on the forest land along with the justification. “We direct the commissioner of Faridabad municipal corporation to submit a chart area-wise disclosing the structures standing on forest land which have not been demolished with justification for non-demolition of unauthorised structures, if any, before the next date of hearing,” the bench said and posted the matter for hearing on October 22. “In addition, the corporation may also indicate the steps taken to remove the debris of demolished structures or process the same to make it environment friendly and compliant,” it said. The corporation had demolished around 7,000 dwelling units in and around Khori village to clear 150 acres of Aravali forest land which was encroached upon. As per the rehabilitation plan, those belonging to the economically weaker sections (EWS) will be rehabilitated at Dabua Colony and Bapu Colony in Faridabad. The corporation had earlier sought more time to remove the encroachments and said that notices have also been served to violaters in other villages, apart from Khori Gaon.

In the evening, she expressed remorse over her language. Tagging Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP, she tweeted: “I am anguished that I used ‘ansanyat’ (intemperate) language when my intentions were good. I have learnt a lesson that one should talk properly even while talking informally in public.” Bharti, a former Madhya Pradesh chief minister, had made the remark when an OBC delegation called on her at her bungalow in Bhopal two days ago. When they talked about reservation and caste census, Bharti said OBCs wouldn’t benefit unless they get reservation in the private sector. OBCs must be united first, and stop fighting against each other, she said. When talking on OBC issues, she said that people had a “misunderstanding” about bureaucracy. “Do you think bureaucracy misleads politicians? No, no. We first talk one on one and then the file is processed. They cannot mislead because we give them salary, promotions, demotions and postings,” she is heard saying in the video. The former CM then questions the “aukat” of bureaucracy and said it was nothing but “picking up our chappals”. She was also heard talking about Lingayat politics of Karnataka and how leaders like Sharad Yadav and Nitish Kumar agree with her on some issues. Meanwhile, state Congress on Monday came down heavily on the BJP after a video of former Union minister Uma Bharti went viral in which she claimed that the bureaucracy carries footwear of leaders. Former chief minister and Rajya Sabha Digvijaya Singh demanded an apology from Bharti. Taking to twitter on Monday evening, Digvijaya Singh said, “What is the stature of the bureaucracy, they carry our slippers – controversial statement from former Union minister Uma Bharti.” The senior Congress leader also tweeted, “Uma, as my younger sister, you have been cautioning me to speak less. But the offensive words you have used against bureaucrats is highly objectionable.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/uma-calls-for-quota-in-pvt-sector-says-bureaucracy-carries-chappals/articleshow/86379056.cms||---

---||Business||Advent to buy Eureka Forbes at valuation of Rs 4,400 crore||Reeba.Zachariah@timesgroup.com Mumbai: US private equity firm Advent International has agreed to buy Indian water purifier and vacuum cleaner maker Eureka Forbes, the firms said on Sunday, valuing it at Rs 4,400 crore, including debt. Advent, which oversees $75 billion in assets, will buy the home appliance business from Shapoorji Pallonji (SP) Group, ending months of negotiations that saw multiple private equity firms and strategic players vying for the asset. TOI reported on September 10 that Advent was leading the race to snap up Eureka Forbes. Housed under publicly listed Forbes & Co as a 100% subsidiary, Eureka Forbes will be demerged into a standalone company and then be listed on the stock exchanges as part of an ongoing restructuring move. The demerger scheme is currently pending court approval. Upon listing, Advent will buy about 73% of Eureka Forbes’s equity from SP. Thereafter, it will make an open offer for an additional 26% stake in the company. SP directors, advised by Standard Chartered Bank and law firm Desai & Diwanji, consider the deal to be “unlocking value for shareholders”. The transaction will enable SP, which owns 18% stake in Tata Sons, to reduce its Rs 30,000-crore debt and sharpen focus on its mainstay construction business. The group is also looking to sell Sterling & Wilson Solar, Afcons Infrastructure and some real estate assets. “We are pleased that Eureka Forbes, a jewel in the SP Group, has found a new home with Advent, while at the same time unlocking value for shareholders,” said SP executive director Jai Mavani. “This transaction also reflects our stated objective and strategy of significant de-leveraging and focusing on our core competencies and businesses.” The incumbent Eureka Forbes team led by Marzin Shroff will continue to guide the company into the next phase of growth. This will be fifth buyout for Advent in the consumer sector since it started to invest in India in 2007. It opened its India office in Mumbai two years later. Over the last 14 years, it has deployed $2.2 billion in 16 Indian companies across industries. Its other four consumer investments are Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals (it exited this company), men’s innerwear brand Dixcy Textiles, women’s innerwear brand Enamor, and savoury snack maker DFM Foods. The proposed buy comes as private equity firms are at the centre of recent deal activity in India. Established in 1982, Eureka Forbes’s brands such as Aquaguard is synonymous with the water purifier category, while Forbes is known for its ‘Make for India’ range of vacuum cleaners. This will be the second time that Eureka Forbes is seeing a change in ownership. SP bought a majority stake in Eureka Forbes from the Tata Group in 2001. It subsequently acquired junior partner Electrolux’s interests in Eureka Forbes, gaining 100% stake in the company.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/advent-to-buy-eureka-forbes-at-valuation-of-rs-4400-crore/articleshow/86370370.cms||Reeba Zachariah
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat police rubbish allegations of ‘extra zeal’ in FIR||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat police on Monday defended itself against allegations made by the victim of Vadodara’s love jihad case when she told the Gujarat high court that the “overzealous” cops in Vadodara had inserted charges of rape, sodomy and violation of anti-conversion law, though she went to file a plain complaint of domestic violence. The state government told the HC that allegations made by the woman against the police officers were not correct. The cops have claimed that all the accusations mentioned in the FIR – rape, sodomy and of forcible conversion – were dictated by the victim herself, who has now become a petitioner and is seeking quashing of the FIR after reaching a compromise with her husband and in-laws, sources said. The police also pointed out that even after lodging FIR with Gotri police in June, the woman filed a written statement with new allegations. On the basis of her additional statement, fresh charges were added in the FIR a couple of days later. The cops also highlighted that the case history the victim had narrated to the doctor also corroborated the FIR. Moreover, the victim had given the same version in her statement before a judicial magistrate under Section 164 CrPC. Hence, the allegations levelled against the police are not proper and also not tenable. In her quashing petition, the woman, who is the first complainant under the Gujarat Freedom of Religion (Amendment) Act, claimed that she had gone to report a case of domestic violence, but “on account of the overzealousness of the police officers involved, facts and offences which were never mentioned or alleged by the informant came to be inserted in the FIR.” The HC is to hear this case further on September 29.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/police-rubbish-allegations-of-extra-zeal-in-fir/articleshow/86379159.cms||---

Issuing admission letters to 50 students under special reservation in Anna University, Stalin said around 12,000 students would join engineering, agriculture, veterinary science, fisheries and law courses. “This will lead their families and the places to development, besides benefiting the state. I am proud to issue these admission letters,” Stalin said. Among the beneficiaries of the CM’s announcement were G Viswanathan, who got admission in The two students have got seats in electronics and communication engineering, while Monish K got admission in computer science engineering — both in College of Engineering, Guindy. They had lost their fathers many years ago and their families were struggling to make ends meet. Viswanathan of Government Higher Secondary School in Anakaputhur and the topper among government school students with an aggregate of 197.9 marks, said the government bearing his education cost would ensure that he completes his studies. His sister has been the family’s sole bread-winner after their father, a watchman, died nine years ago.Monish, another student from the same school who works part-time to support his family, said the announcement has come as a “huge relief” to his family. He was raised by his mother after his father died in 2015. His mother works at Chennai airport’s tollgate for a monthly salary of ₹5,000. He scored 195.75 marks to get the eighth rank among government school students. Stalin said 69% of students of government schools came from villages and the special reservation has become a virtual rural development scheme. He recalled it was the DMK government headed by M Karunanidhi that cancelled entrance exams for medical and engineering courses as it had been blocking the entry of rural students in professional courses. “The government is conducting a legal battle against NEET. Government orders issued to ensure social justice are laying the foundation for an equitable society,” he said. Asking the departments of school education and higher education to lay the foundation for Tamil society’s all-round development, he said the present government’s tenure should become a golden period for higher education, professional education and research. “If any one of the students benefiting out of this reservation comes and tells me years later that he is working in a big company or has started his own business because of this government order, there cannot be a happier moment for me,” Stalin said. Higher education minister K Ponmudi said so far only 1% of Anna University students were from government schools. School education minister Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi, health minister Ma Subramanian and chief secretary V Irai Anbu participated in the event.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/7-5-quota-tn-to-pay-full-edu-cost-of-govt-students/articleshow/86379112.cms||---

---||Bhopal||Act tough against mining & other mafia, CM tells officials||Indore: Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Monday instructed local administrative officials to act tough against mining and other mafia. Addressing divisional commissioners and district collectors from across the state in the commissioners'/collectors' conference through video conferencing, the chief minister appreciated several districts for taking appropriate steps in implementation of government-run schemes, benefiting people, and checking crimes. He also commended stern action taken in Indore and Ujjain districts to check bootlegging. Chouhan also asked Indore police to check thefts and loot cases and work on recovery of booty in such cases. Following the CM’s instructions, Indore administration and police have planned a meeting on Tuesday to decide their further course of action. “We have been acting tough against all kind of mafia. We will strengthened our action further. Strict action, including demolition of dhaba/hotels, where illicit liquor will be sold or served, will be taken. A plan of action will be finalised with local police in a meeting on Tuesday to tighten noose around all kind of mafia,” said collector Manish Singh. In Indore, 74, 818 litres of illicit liquor were confiscated under the action taken against illegal liquor. Indore stood first in entire state in the action taken against illegal liquor on the basis of quantity. Also, a total of 4067 cases of illegal liquor proceedings were registered in the district, he added. The collector said: “Indore is included in the first five districts of Madhya Pradesh in the field of technical education, skill development and employment. Since April to August 2021, 8443 people of the district have got new opportunities of employment and self-employment.” In the conference, Singh informed the CM that potato has been selected under ‘one district one product Scheme’ in Indore and under Pradhan Mantri Formalisation of Micro Food Processing Enterprise Scheme, six projects will be started in the district by 1 November 2021. Following commencement of the projects, 12 to 15 metric tonnes of potato would be produced in the district every day. “Two potato clusters and three durum wheat clusters would be started in the district and with this, income of the farmers will also get doubled, while agricultural industries will also get a boost that will help in economic development of the district,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/act-tough-against-mining-other-mafia-cm-tells-officials/articleshow/86379104.cms||---
---||Varanasi||Was it possible for opposition to begin Ram temple work in Ayodhya, CM Yogi Adityanath asks people||VARANASI: Crediting Prime Minister for the launch of Ram temple construction in Ayodhya, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday questioned the people whether it was possible for the opposition, including Samajwadi Party (SP), Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) or the Congress to do the same. He also took a swipe at the SP leadership, saying that “even as the people reeled under floods and epidemics, rulers from a particular family enjoyed dance and music by Bollywood artistes in Saifai”. “It was the PM Modi-led government at the Centre which fulfilled the promise of ending the over 500 years wait for the construction of a grand Ram Mandir at the birthplace of Lord Ram in Ayodhya. Was it in any way possible for SP, BSP or Congress to do the same,” he questioned the people while addressing a charged gathering at Mungra Badshahpur assembly area in Jaunpur on Monday afternoon after laying the foundation of new projects and inaugurating several others worth over Rs 250 crores. “The BJP-led governments at the Centre and in the state are working for the betterment of the people without discriminating on the basis of caste, community, region or language. Our slogan is ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’,” said Yogi, adding, “In the previous government, development was done on face value.” He added, “Only four districts got uninterrupted power supply while 71 others remained in the dark. When the people suffered due to epidemics like dengue, encephalitis or natural calamities including floods, the rulers who cared only for themselves and their families remained busy in enjoying dance and music programmes by artistes from Mumbai in Saifai.” Highlighting large-scale migration from Jaunpur, Yogi said, “Had the past governments created an atmosphere to attract investors and mega investments, local youths would not have been compelled to leave their homes for earning a livelihood.” Yogi further said, “Even when recruitments for government jobs were launched in the previous government, people from the ruling family went out with big bags to generate money. But, in my government jobs are being given to the deserving with full transparency. All those who tried to break the sanctity of the recruitment process have been sent behind the bars.” “Development had never been the agenda of SP and BSP,” he said adding, “In SP regime there was a competition of grabbing benefits of government schemes, including ration by the people associated with the ruling party. In the BSP regime, the development issues were lost in the big stomach of the elephant (BSP symbol). Today, efforts on the crime and law and order front has not only changed the image of UP, but also made the state free of frequent riots which took place during the festivals like Ramleela and Durga Puja.” “Directives have been issued to officials in all districts to allow Durga Puja celebrations and Ramleelas at open places by ensuring strict compliance of Covid-19 protocol,” he said. He also appealed to the people of Mungra Badshahpur assembly area not to repeat the mistake of 2017 assembly election when Sushma Patel had won on a BSP ticket but was suspended by her party in 2020 following her meeting with the SP chief. “Had BJP’s Seema Dwivedi retained the seat, each and every citizen of this assembly area would have considered himself as a ‘badshah’. But, despite losing this seat, the BJP continued helping the people here with government schemes without any discrimination and major development projects of over Rs 250 crores were also launched,” he added. Hinting towards the 2022 assembly polls, Yogi said that the coming six months were crucial and everyone should intensify preparations for the BJP’s victory. In Ghazipur, Yogi says mafia, criminal will pay for their deeds On the home turf of jailed mafia don and MLA Mukhtar Ansari in Ghazipur, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said that mafia dons and criminals who brought bad name to Ghazipur under the patronage of the previous government, will keep paying the cost of their deeds even after their illegally created economic empires have been bulldozed. While addressing a public meeting at the Town National Inter College ground in Ghazipur’s Saidpur after inaugurating projects of Rs 195 crores on Monday, Yogi said, “The state has witnessed a major change in the past four and half years as mafia elements have lost their ground. Previous governments patronized those elements but the BJP showed how they should be tackled. Illegal possession of mafia elements from government lands have been removed and their illegal earnings have also been checked. This drive will continue.” Announcing that the under construction medical college in the district will be named after Maharshi Vishwamitra, the CM said that the Purvanchal Expressway, which will be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi soon, will change the fate of eastern UP by fast-tracking development.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/was-it-possible-for-oppn-to-begin-ram-temple-work-yogi-asks-people/articleshow/86380571.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

---||India||Troubled Bengal BJP unit gets new chief||NEW DELHI: Balurghat MP Sukanta Majumdar was on Monday appointed West Bengal BJP president, replacing Dilip Ghosh who has been elevated as national vice-president of the party. The appointment of Majumdar is significant as it comes when the party is pitted in a tough battle against CM Mamata Banerjee who is contesting assembly bypolls from Bhabanipur and also amid internal strife in the wake of party MP Babul Supriyo joining TMC. In another important development, BJP chief J P Nadda appointed Babyrani Maurya as national vice-president. She was the Uttarakhand governor and resigned recently. Both Ghosh and Maurya are OBCs and their appointment is seen as part of BJP’s continued outreach to the community which has the largest chunk of voters in the country. Surprisingly, senior leaders like Prakash Javadekar and Ravi Shankar Prasad, who had been dropped as Cabinet ministers in the recent rejig, have not made it to the organisation, in contrast with the speculation doing the rounds since then. Ghosh’s tenure was to last till the end of next year and his premature exit comes in the wake of reports of internal differences within the state unit. Supriyo was also at daggers drawn with Ghosh and his resignation from the party was also seen as a fallout of the same. Supriyo had outrightly said he didn’t want to continue with the party under Ghosh’s leadership.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/troubled-bengal-bjp-unit-gets-new-chief/articleshow/86384489.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Rush missing at vax centres across city||Kolkata: Despite the heavy rain and waterlogging in different districts, Bengal clocked a good vaccination count with 8.5 lakh plus doses being administered during the day till reports came in last. Health officials said that had there not been the inclement weather that resulted in a flood-like situation, the state could have surpassed its best record. In Kolkata, the Covid-19 vaccine centres had a contrasting picture on Monday — the centres had the stocks of doses but there was hardly any taker due to the torrential rain and waterlogging in most parts of the city. “We could have easily crossed the 13 lakh doses mark, had there not been the inclement weather and the flooding in various parts,” said a senior health official. The state’s best single day performance so far has been 13 lakh jabs administered on September 18 when Bengal also crossed the 5 crore jab mark. The situation was, however, different in the suburbs and districts where people braved the downpour and queued up to get jabbed. This helped the administration deliver close to nine lakh doses on a rainy day.  “Usually, we end up distributing 250 to 300 tokens even before the vaccination starts. On Monday, there were less than 40 people,” said an official at School of Tropical Medicine. The entire Central Avenue and College Street — two main roads that lead to School of Tropical medicine and Medical College Kolkata — were waterlogged. “People could not come to the centres because of the rain and the waterlogging,” said an official of Medical College Kolkata. Several KMC clinics in central and north Kolkata also wore a deserted look on Monday. “The vaccination centre behind Jorasanko police station was inaccessible as all the streets leading to it were waterlogged for most part of the day. There were few people to get jabbed at the KMC clinic inside College Square Swimming pool as the entire area was under water,” said an official of the health department in KMC. But most KMC clinics and other CVCs in the suburbs, closer to railway stations, registered high footfalls despite the downpour. Though the ID Hospital campus was not under water, the surrounding stretches were waterlogged. So, the CVC at the hospital saw barely one third of the recipients taking the jab. “Against an average 500 doses a day, around 110 people turned up to take the jab on Monday,” said R Venkatesh regional director (east) at Narayana Health.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rush-missing-at-vax-centres-across-city/articleshow/86379134.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Pune||Cocktail antibody turns into ‘widely used’ drug||PUNE: The cocktail of fast-acting laboratory-made antibodies — one of the most expensive drugs ever to be deployed against Covid-19 — has transformed from a “sparingly used” drug into a “widely used” one, almost replacing several commonly used medicines. Treating doctors from across the country have started using it as the first line of treatment, primarily for the affording class patients fitting the therapy criteria. But experts from the national Covid task force have cautioned against its indiscriminate use. The drug is not a “magic bullet” and should only be used in carefully selected patients with risk factors, experts stressed. Pune-based Ruby Hall Clinic’s chief intensivist Kapil Zirpe said, “The cocktail antibody is being widely used as the first line of treatment for mildly ill as well as asymptomatic Covid patients with comorbidities to prevent hospitalisation and deaths. This is not only happening in India but across the world.” Chennai-based Gleneagles Global Hospital’s infectious diseases expert Subramanian Swaminathan said, “None of our patients on whom we used the cocktail antibody therapy required hospitalisation. The promising outcomes have significantly increased its use.” Physician Aniket Joshi, a member of the Association of Physicians of India (API), said, “Patients with comorbidities are more likely to become serious. The therapy is found extremely beneficial in them. It brings down the treatment expenses. Even doctors in small towns are using it.” The cocktail antibody had become the first line of treatment for many mildly ill patients with pre-existing medical conditions, said Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital’s infectious diseases expert Parikshit Prayag. Selecting the right patients was the key, though. “Those with multiple risk factors for disease progression, are early in their course and have no antibodies, to begin with, are the patients who will benefit the most,” said Prayag, an American board-certified expert in internal medicine and infectious diseases. Cocktail antibody therapy — casirivimab and imdevimab — has almost replaced drugs like favipiravir and inhaled budesonide. “The cocktail antibody-drug has given us a good option in select patients. It appears more promising compared to drugs like favipiravir. However, the cost remains a prohibitive factor,” Prayag said. Mumbai-based Nanavati Hospital’s chest physician Salil Bendre said, “I was the first to use the therapy at our hospital. Positive treatment outcomes following the therapy have fostered the doctors’ confidence about its safety and efficacy over the period.” Mildly ill and young Covid patients without comorbidities as well as those who find the therapy unaffordable are still being treated with commonly used Covid drugs like favipiravir and others. “The therapy costs Rs63,000 per patient and hence, it is still out of reach for many,” said infectious diseases expert Ameet Dravid, who used it on 67 patients in the last two months. All of them improved and barring one, none required hospitalisation. Experts from the national Covid task force warned against using the drug indiscriminately. “The drug is not a magic bullet. Its use needs to be individualised,” said Sanjay Pujari, a member of the national Covid task force.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cocktail-antibody-therapy-only-for-select-patients/articleshow/86381392.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The League leaders had earlier threatened to boycott the UDF agitation, against the anti-people policies of the central and state governments, unless the UDF convener K R Girijan of Kerala Congress (Jacob) group is removed from the post. However, the UDF state convener M M Hassan held talks with Girijan and the Muslim League leaders in the district. Girijan later gave a written apology to Hassan. He said it was his mistake to have issued a press release on behalf of UDF without the consent of the UDF district chairman and the DCC president . “I apologise for the inconvenience caused to UDF and Muslim League by the news published based on the press release issued earlier. I will henceforth issue press releases only with the knowledge and consent of the UDF district chairman and DCC president,” Girijan said in his letter. Subsequently, the Muslim League district leadership decided to call off their boycott and participated in the agitation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/iuml-backtracks-after-udf-convener-apologises/articleshow/86381370.cms||---

Entertaining the plea, a bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Amit Bansal, however, made it clear it was not issuing notices to the chief minister and other ministers of the state. The petitioner and advocate, M L Sharma, has demanded derecognition of AAP as a party and remove CM Arvind Kejriwal and other ministers from the Constitutional office due to alleged deliberate breach of the Constitution and the Representation of People’s Act in the interest of public. The plea was opposed by senior advocate Rahul Mehra, representing Delhi government, saying it was a motivated and mischievous petition coloured as PIL and needed to be dismissed with heavy costs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/plea-in-high-court-to-derecognise-aap-over-ganesh-festivities/articleshow/86379123.cms||---
---||Delhi||Suspended Delhi Traffic Police constable held in cheating case||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police on Monday said it arrested a suspended Delhi Traffic Police constable from northwest Delhi in a cheating case. DCP (North West) Usha Rangnani confirmed the incident and said they were investigating the matter. The accused, Rohit Dalal, was posted in the Janakpuri traffic circle and suspended in March this year, police said. A source confirmed that investigators had found his role in two online cheating cases where he took money from victims and did not return. In one of the cases reported from Jahangirpuri, the complainant informed police that on September 11 around 4pm, a traffic police constable came to his shop and said that his phone server was not working. “He told me to transfer Rs 23,000 to a phone number and assured me that he will repay soon,” the victim said. After the money was transferred, the accused gave his debit card to the complainant and asked him to swipe. “I said that I did not have a swiping machine. Meanwhile, he got busy on call and I got busy with other customers,” the complainant added. “By the time I could notice, he had disappeared. When I called and asked him to repay, he said he will transfer the money, but has not,” he added. A complaint was filed at Jahangirpuri police station and a case under section 420 registered. Further probe revealed that he was involved in another cheating case registered in one of the police stations in North West district. “We scanned CCTVs and were able to trace the accused and arrest him,” police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/suspended-traffic-cop-held-in-cheating-case/articleshow/86379156.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||‘Fleeing abroad after MBBS without serving deplorable’||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Monday deprecated the practice adopted by some medical students who move abroad after completion of studies in India and do not intend to serve in rural areas. While disposing of a petition filed by an MBBS graduate, whose documents were withheld by the government for not submitting Rs 2 lakh bond in lieu of one-year rural service after internship, Justice Bhargav Karia said, “It was a pious duty on part of the student to render service to the government, to pay back the obligation he has undertaken by paying back to the society or to pay the money for not rendering his services in order to pursue his education abroad. By taking advantage of education facility available in the country and then fleeing abroad without rendering any service to this country is deprecated.” Justice Karia ordered the government to return the documents that the student had submitted at the time of his admission in the medical college run by GMERS at Himmatnagar in 2015. The documents were not returned because the student had not submitted bonds, which was the admission condition. However, the student insisted on the certificates regarding completion of his MBBS and internship. The court said that it would not interfere on the government’s decision over bond. The court said that the state government is entitled to recover Rs 2 lakh towards the bond condition. Upon the government’s insistence on recovering Rs 2 lakh from the student, his father, who too was a petitioner, said, “Asking for money for provisional certificate amounts to extortion on part of the government.” The court cited a Supreme Court order and said that rendering services to the government after completion of MBBS is not unreasonable. The petitioner’s argument that the college was self-financed is not ground to escape the condition of rural service. It is also not believable that the student was not aware of the bond condition even after completion of five years of study.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/fleeing-abroad-after-mbbs-without-serving-deplorable/articleshow/86379129.cms||---
---||Kochi||Church dispute: Govt can’t claim helplessness, says Kerala high court||KOCHI: The Kerala high court on Monday said the state government cannot plead helplessness in implementing the Supreme Court’s 2017 judgment in favour of Orthodox faction in the Church dispute case. Considering cases seeking police protection for conducting religious rites, Justice Devan Ramachandran said the government must disclose its stand in the matter before the court takes a final decision on the pleas for police protection. Issues between the Orthodox and Jacobite factions are still dangerously poised and it is the state machinery that has to provide protection as demanded in the petitions, and the government’s stand is therefore significant, the bench said. Additional advocate general Asok M Cherian submitted that while the government is ready to comply with the court’s directions, it is finding it difficult to do so for fear of breach of peace. Responding to the submission, the court said the government cannot plead helplessness when it has the mechanism to ensure compliance with a lawful order through means of law. The court asked the government to inform its views by September 29. The cases seeking police protection are mainly filed by the Orthodox faction as part of implementing the 2017 Supreme Court judgment that it is entitled to administer the 1,100 churches. The apex court’s judgment had become final with the dismissal of a review petition later.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/church-dispute-govt-cant-claim-helplessness-says-hc/articleshow/86381432.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: Cops doze off, rape accused flees Warje police station; re-arrested||PUNE: A 28-year-old man — arrested on September 17 on the charge of raping a four-year-old girl — walked out of the Warje police station’s surveillance room early Saturday morning taking advantage of the fact that the two constables, who were supposed to keep an eye on him, had fallen asleep. The man’s alcohol addiction, however, led to his re-arrest on Sunday night from a watering hole in the Karvenagar area. Deputy commissioner of police (Zone III) Pournima Gaikwad told TOI, “An assistant commissioner of police is conducting an inquiry on how the man managed to walk out of the police station. Action against the policemen found responsible for such lapse will be taken on the receipt of the inquiry report.” Senior inspector Shankar Khatake of the Warje police told TOI, “We had arrested the man following a complaint lodged on September 17 by the minor survivor’s mother, who accused him of sexually assaulting her daughter.” He said, “A case under Section 376 (rape) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act was registered and the man was kept in the surveillance room. He was not handcuffed. The police had completed the arrest formalities.” Sometime between 4.30am and 6.30am on Saturday, the man woke up and walked out of the surveillance room of the police station. No one noticed him walking out of the police station, Khatake said. The police started searching for the man after realizing that he had escaped from their custody. “We contacted his family members and relatives, but they said he had not gone home. We then scanned the Mutha riverbed and other areas. We also visited different sites where the man had worked earlier,” Khatake said. “We had distributed the man’s photographs and other details among all alcohol outlets in Warje, Sinhagad Road, Kothrud, Uttamnagar and Karvenagar, asking them to alert us in case he reached those places. On Sunday evening, we got a call from an alcohol outlet in Karvenagar. The caller said the man was in the outlet. Our team went to the outlet and nabbed him following a brief chase,” said Khatake. A separate case for an offence under Section 224 (resistance or obstruction by a person to his lawful apprehension) of the IPC has been registered against the man.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/cops-doze-off-rape-accused-flees-police-stn-re-arrested/articleshow/86379165.cms||---
---||Rajkot||Excess rains wash away almost 34,000 hectares of agricultural land in Gujarat||RAJKOT: Around a month back the farmers were staring at crop failure due to lack of rain. But last week’s excessive downpour proved to be a double whammy for them. Not only standing crops but also agricultural land was washed away in Jamnagar district and parts of Rajkot district. Apart from counting this season’s crop loss, the farmers are also worried over the hardships they will face over the next two-three years. “We have lost this season’s crop. But our major worry is to make the land suitable for farming again. Farmers will have to flatten the agricultural land and lay new soil. It will be a few years before most of us can take a new crop,” Pal Ambaliya, president of Kisan congress said. Official figures state that an estimated 34,000 hectares of agricultural land was washed away in the two districts. And the counting is not over yet. “According to a tentative estimate 31,000 hectares of agricultural land got damaged. The rain hasn’t subsided yet and the farmland is still waterlogged so our teams are facing difficulty in the survey. Around 100 teams are doing the survey of losses suffered,” P S Zamsingh, Jamnagar district collector, said. According to Rajkot district administration around 4,398 hectares of agricultural land in Lodhika taluka was damaged by rain. Lodika received a rainfall of around 650mm in two days. Chintan Kangad, a farmer of Upleta taluka, saw rain wash away standing groundnut crop from his 15 bigha land in Nilakha village. “In Upleta and Bhayavadar taluka there are three rivers — Moj, Venu and Bhadar — and all are overflowing. The farmers in Upleta and Bhayavadar, who had sown groundnut, cotton and tur (pigeon peas), have suffered huge losses,” Kangad said. Payal Kantariya, a farmer of Jamnagar district, said that except Lalpur and Jamjodhpur talukas, agricultural land in other parts of the district were damaged by the excessive rain. “In other talukas including Kalavad, Dhrol, Jodiya agricultural land got washed away. In many villages entire plants of groundnut are uprooted and farmers will now have to lay new soil to make the land fertile again.” According to sources, 15-20% of cotton crop was damaged in Gondal, Babra, Aatkot, Kalavad and Dhrol talukas. Oil millers see silver lining amidst the gloom The excessive rains have caused widespread damage and farmers are crying over crop loss, but oil millers are seeing a silver lining amidst the gloom. Kishor Viradia, president of Saurashtra Oil Mills Association (SOMA) said, “Till last month we were expecting only 30% crop this season because of the prevailing drought-like situation. Jamnagar and Porbandar are the biggest producers of groundnut and after the rains we are expecting around 60 to 70% crop this season.” Groundnut is cultivated in Gir Somnath, Junagadh, Amreli, Surendrangar, Jamnagar, Porbandar, Devbhumi Dewarka and Bhavnagar districts. Gujarat’s average groundnut production is around 32 lakh ton. Damage to govt infrastructure pegged at Rs 96 crore According to an estimate of the Rajkot district administration, government infrastructure worth Rs 96 crore was damaged due to the heavy rains. “As per primary estimate 14 main roads, 138 minor roads, 117 electricity poles, 14 feeders and check dams were damaged. The total damage is to the tune of Rs 96 crore,” Arun Mahesh Babu, Rajkot district collector, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/excess-rains-wash-away-almost-34k-hectares-of-agricultural-land/articleshow/86376873.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

International matches will be played in the Pink City after a gap of eight years and would come as a shot in the arm for the Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA) which is looking to revive cricketing culture in the state. It was on October 16, 2013 that an international match was last played in Jaipur when India took on Australia in an ODI match at the Sawai Mansingh (SMS) Stadium. While New Zealand and Sri Lanka will tour India for two Tests and three T20Is each in November 2021 and March 2022, respectively, West Indies will play three ODIs and as many T20Is in February 2022. The first T20I between India and New Zealand on November 17 and the 2nd ODI between India and West Indies on February 9, 2022 will be played at the SMS Stadium. Getting international matches back to Rajasthan was one of the goals that Vaibhav Gehlot had set himself when he took over as the president of the RCA almost two years back. “This is a very proud moment as it is after a hiatus of eight years that Jaipur will host international matches. I have thanked both BCCI president Sourav Ganguly and secretary Jay Shah for making it possible and showing faith in me. I was in continuous touch with them in the last couple of years, demanding and convincing them that Jaipur was capable of being a fantastic host,” the RCA president told TOI. It is the result of a consolidated effort of RCA office-bearers, who worked under the guidance of the association's patron and ex-president CP Joshi, and the backing they received from state chief minister Ashok Gehlot, he said. “We are trying our best to ensure cricketers and cricket lovers in Rajasthan get all that they deserve. The construction work of the new stadium in Jaipur and renovation work at the Barkatullah Khan Stadium in Jodhpur are already underway. It feels good that we are moving in the right direction to accomplish our plans,” Vaibhav said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/jaipur-to-hostintl-cricketafter-8-years/articleshow/86381484.cms||Mandakini Shalya
---||Kolkata||OPD footfall drops in flooded hospitals||Kolkata: Several hospitals, both government and private, bore the brunt of overnight rain that left numerous pockets flooded. With premises or roads leading to the hospital under knee-deep water, Kolkata hospitals on Monday recorded a 50-80% drop in OPD footfall. Some hospitals also had to deploy ambulances to bring in their employees, including doctors, as many could not commute by their cars because of the water level. Hospitals also had a thin attendance which fortunately was offset by the fall in patient count. “There is water everywhere in the hospital’s surrounding and parts of the premises got flooded as well. As a result, most patients avoided coming to the hospital. Since our hospital is in a low-lying area, it takes almost about three days for rain water to recede. So it is not going to be easy for us for the next few days,” said CK Birla Hospital CMRI COO Simmardeep Gill. Other hospitals in the locality — Kothari Medical Centre, Woodlands Hospital and BM Birla Heart Research Centre — too remained inundated. About a kilometre away, IPGMER (SSKM) officials had a tough time trying to pump out water from the gynaecology OPD and from the cardiology department. “The gynaecology OPD always gets submerged in water whenever there is heavy rain. This time, water had entered the ground floor of the cardiology department as well. By evening, we managed to pump out some water,” said a hospital official. On Monday, water had entered School of Tropical Medicine’s pharmacy department where officials had to work in knee-deep water. As water had entered the ground floor at KPC Hospital, doctors and nurses had to attend to patients in ankle-deep water. “With the approach road to RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences submerged, we had just about 500 patients in our OPD against our normal count between 1,000 and 1200 patients,” said R Venkatesh regional director (east) Narayana Health. Among hospitals off EM Bypass, the ones in the Mukundapur area — especially Medica and AMRI — were the worst-affected. In fact, AMRI’s Mukundapur unit remained flooded for large part of the day. “All our three units were impacted and our Mukundapur unit was the worst affected. We recorded only about 20% of our usual OPD footfall,” said a source at AMRI Hospital Group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/opd-footfall-drops-in-flooded-hospitals/articleshow/86379284.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

With over 100 active vaccination centres in the city, the NMMC is hopeful of covering the remaining 7% over the next few days. Moreover, 4.37 lakh people or 40.4% of the eligible population have been fully immunised. NMMC officials said a sizeable population of the city has been vaccinated despite a shortage of vaccine supply, compared to other cities in the state. This was also possible because of two jumbo vaccination drives held in the city within the last fortnight, where over 70,000 vaccine doses were available. As per government’s present protocol, given a population of 15 lakh, the city needed to vaccinate over 10 lakh people. As of now, 14.38 lakh vaccine doses have been administered in the city and priority was given to the underprivileged sections. The civic body aims to facilitate more than 110 centres to set a target of vaccinating over 25,000 people in a day.

It will issue tenders in the next few days for procuring 200 double deckers, which will also be fully electric, sources said. “We want to make nearly 50% of our fleet electric by 2023,” BEST general manager Lokesh Chandra said on Monday evening. “We have floated the tender for 1,900 buses which will include 1,400 full-length buses of 12 metres, 100 Mini buses and 400 Midi buses,” he said. The maximum period, as per the tender notice, for procuring the 1,900 buses is one-and-a-half years, with 25% new electric bus procurement (475 buses) for Mumbai in six months, 25% in the next six months and 50% thereafter. The state government’s Electric Vehicle policy calls for the public transport undertaking maintaining a 15% fleet as ‘electric’ by 2025. Chandra said that the BEST has taken this target seriously. At present, the BEST has charging stations at four bus depots, but it will soon increase this facility to all 27 depots.

The survey was conducted along 10 spots on the route, largely along Laxmi Road. The average ambient noise recorded along the route during this year’s immersion was 59.8 decibels (dB), lower than 65.5 dB recorded in 2020. None of the spots along the route was louder than the 73.5 dB recorded at Kunte Chowk at 4pm on Sunday. In 2019, the average ambient noise along the route in the same time period was 83.2 dB. In his report, Mahesh Shindikar, professor of the applied sciences department of CoEP, said a combination of the order banning processions, strict enforcement by police and administration and increasing awareness among people kept the noise levels and crowding low.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/noise-level-on-2021-immersion-day-lower-than-even-last-years-reveals-coep-study/articleshow/86379229.cms||---
---||Kochi||Govt clears lone bid to buy silt pusher||Thiruvananthapuram: Two months after the water resources department approved a single tender for desilting of Amayizhanjan canal at 36% higher than the project cost, the government has now approved another lone bid for the purchase of silt pusher at a cost of Rs 2.8 crore. The government has given administrative sanction for the purchase of silt pusher for the irrigation department for desilting of canal and reconstruction of protection wall from Kannamoola to Akkulam. The chief engineer (mechanical) of the irrigation department has reported that no bid was received in the first tender and one bid was received in the retender. The company which took part in the retender submitted a bid of Rs 2.8 crore, which does not include annual service charge. The chief engineer also reported that silt pusher was a special purpose machine and there was only a remote chance of getting competitive bids and certified that the machine had only one manufacturer based in Netherlands and one authorized dealer in the country was Matprop Technical Services Private Ltd, Kerala, which submitted the single bid. The departmental purchase committee meeting held in March had approved the proposal and gave sanction for the purchase of silt pusher with accessories at a cost of Rs 2.8 crore. The water resources department has already given sanction to award the work for desilting based on a single tender at 36% higher than the estimated project approved cost. The decision was made to award the work to the single tender after there were no other takers. The government had given administrative sanction for the work of desilting and re-construction of sidewalls of Amayizhanjan canal from Kannamoola to Akkulam for an amount of Rs 25 crore in March 2019. The sanction was given based on the proposal submitted by the chief engineer (irrigation and administration). Single tender was approved for the work including KWA sewerage line connection, side protection works, purchase of silt pusher, its operation and maintenance, dredging and conveyance of silt to the disposal site, including all allied machines for dredging, laying boundary stones for demarcating the boundary and unforeseen expenses. Major share of cost has been allocated for sewerage line connection; Rs 10.78 crore. Unforeseen expenses have been estimated at Rs 5 lakh. The chief engineer had earlier reported that the work comprising sewer lines, side protection, dredging and conveyance of silt will cost Rs 18.13 crore. Later, technical sanction was given at a cost of Rs 24.86 crore. The work was first tendered in May 2020. However, no response was received and it was retendered in July 2020. One contractor submitted the bid and quoted Rs 24.82 crore, which was 36.93% above the estimate prepared by the executive engineer of irrigation division. The contractor did not reduce the quoted amount despite negotiations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/govt-clears-lone-bid-to-buy-silt-pusher/articleshow/86376899.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||Lucknow||Govt achievements to bolster BJP poll prospects: Bureaucrats||Lucknow: With Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath completing four-and-a-half years in office on September 19, senior bureaucrats are of the view that the government has taken major steps which changed the lives of the people. They believe that the government’s initiatives, if publicized properly, could boost the prospects of the BJP in the UP assembly elections. “The direct bank transfer (DBT) system ended the concept of middlemen whose involvement never allowed people to get complete benefit of government’s welfare schemes. Beneficiaries now receive SMS with information of the date and the amount credited to their account. Beneficiaries are getting direct benefit in schemes like pension, scholarship, farmers’ funds and payment of crops yield,” a senior official said. Another bureaucrat said the government’s transfer policy gave stability to officials and helped in good governance. “Transfer and posting had become an industry under the previous governments which stopped under the BJP government. There was a time when people used to roam in the secretariat claiming that they can facilitate transfers and postings in various departments. Transparency is being maintained in appointments,” he said. Officials said stability was provided in terms of bureaucratic reshuffling which was very frequent under previous governments. They said shorter tenures were common in the past which affected the morale of officials. Another senior bureaucrat said the benefit of development was reaching the people in all parts of the state irrespective of caste, creed or religion. “Efforts are being made to ensure that if some people are not getting the benefits of any central scheme due to some reason, schemes are being started at the state level to cover people who are getting left out. Chief Minister housing scheme and Chief Minister Jan Arogya Yojana are some such examples,” he added. According to officials, the CM has been reviewing the law and order situation on a daily basis and has ordered strict action against criminals irrespective of caste, religion or political affiliation. “The CM never hesitated in helping poor patients in getting treatment. He has distributed over Rs 1,000 crore for treatment of patients,” another official said. Another major administrative change was that technological intervention was applied in totality to check corruption. Citing an example, officials said that ration distribution system was infamous due to corruption but became relatively transparent with the introduction of E-PoS machines at PDS shops. Increased use of technology to curb corrupt practices also attracted investors to set up units in the state. Officials added that the BJP government also implemented central schemes better than the previous regimes. The government also expedited 13 pending schemes such as Saryu Canal and Baarh Sagar pojects. “The government formulated policies to help small scale industries and revive traditional trade and products. A campaign was launched to link banks with small artisans and industries,” another officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/govt-achievements-to-bolster-bjp-poll-prospects-bureaucrats/articleshow/86381492.cms||Rajiv Srivastava

A Vimannagar resident, who recently visited two to three centres, said most facilities had limited equipment and insufficient staff. Enrolment and updating Aadhaar details have been an issue in Pune district since the past two-three weeks. Most offices are undergoing migration of the server from ‘Mahaonline’ to ‘MahaIT’, which requires operators and machines to be re-registered. An official said a government resolution was issued last month regarding the server migration affecting the enrolment and updating process. Pune district nodal officer for Aadhaar Rohini Akhade said the server migration is leading to some issues at most offices and the staff is trying to resolve them. “The process will be streamlined in the next 15 days,” she said, adding that the district needs more machines too. “Pune needs at least 300 machines,” said Akhade. Akhade said Pune district has slowly commenced Aadhaar enrolment and will be increasing efforts once the server migration is resolved. State government officials said efforts are on to speed up the process across Maharashtra and push for the proposal to take on more private operators.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/aadhaar-enrolment-update-process-affected-due-to-equipment-shortage/articleshow/86379273.cms||Nisha Nambiar

The developers of these 350 projects also want MahaRERA not to include those in the “lapsed project” list. The MahaRERA had recently described 3,371 residential projects across the state as “lapsed projects” between 2017 and 2021 with the developers failing to complete them within the deadline. Of these, 350 projects have come up for scrutiny .“It is less than 10% of the total number of the lapsed projects. A circular will be issued on what kind of projects that have been categorised in the ‘lapsed project’ category and can be regularised. It will mention the conditions that the developers of these projects have to follow and not allow the citizens to suffer,” a MahaRERA official said. The authority is mulling over whether or not to validate the projects that have uploaded Form 4 and Occupancy Certificate (OC), with the date of OC before expiry of the project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/350-lapsed-projects-up-for-scrutiny-by-maharera/articleshow/86379294.cms||Nisha Nambiar

Kannatt, who complained against the alleged irregularities at the cooperative bank at Karuvannur, said he was under stress and had undertaken a pilgrimage to Parassinikadavu temple. Sujesh had left home in the car on Saturday morning and switched off his phone. “We all became worried when we were not able to contact him even by Saturday evening. So we filed a complaint with the police at Irinjalakuda,” said his mother Suma. However, Kannatt reached home around 1:30am on Monday and reported at the Irinjalakuda police station around 7:45am. The CI of Irinjalakuda said that Kannatt was produced before the judicial first class magistrate and his statement was taken. Kannatt had reportedly told the police that he was unaware of the sensation created in the media about his disappearance as his mobile was switched off. Kannatt, who was the Porathissery CPM branch secretary, had launched a solo protest demanding action against those involved in the fraud at the bank, on June 14 last. Subsequently, he was expelled from the party. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/missing-whistleblower-of-bank-fraud-returns/articleshow/86381512.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: BJP duped people in name of Ganga, gaddha, gaiyya, says Akhilesh Yadav||LUCKNOW: Accusing the BJP of having duped people of Uttar Pradesh in the name of ‘Ganga maiyya’ (Ganga river), ‘gaddha’ (potholes) and ‘gaiyya’ (cow), Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Monday said people can easily see through government claims of development and will no longer bite the bait. “This is the reason why all celebrations and enthusiasm of the government completing the four-and-a-half-year rule are limited only to press conferences. People have understood that the BJP is creating an illusion based on jugglery of statistics. These BJP publicists will be shunted out of power in 2022,” Akhilesh said. Accusing the government of taking the gullible and innocent people of Uttar Pradesh for a ride, Akhilesh took to twitter to state: “Ganga maiyya, gaddah, gaiya … Inko bhi chhal gaye Thagaiiya (People have been taken for a ride in the name of the Ganga, potholes and cows)”. He went on to add that the taxpayer today wants to know how and where the money collected in the form of taxes has been spent in the name of Ganga, cows and removing potholes. The former UP CM said the ruling BJP has only made promises all through its regime and failed to fulfil any at all. “All tall claims of the government’s development projects stand exposed in the form of cracks that have come in Purvanchal Expressway roads even before it could be formally inaugurated. In Varanasi more than 50 per cent of the city roads are in poor condition. The condition is no different in Gorakhpur. In the state capital of Lucknow, more than 500 potholes on Shaheed Path stand as a testimony to the failures of the government,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-duped-people-in-name-of-ganga-gaddha-gaiyya-sp/articleshow/86381523.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

Sood said, “Today I came out and saw people sleeping outside my house in the open to meet me for help. Some of them sold their valuables to travel to reach me. I was feeling helpless as I could not reach them in the last four days. I will continue doing good work irrespective of the political party in power. So even if Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, or any other state governments call me for help, I will do it everywhere, to bring a smile to the face of the poor and needy.” “I am even talking with top people in Telangana to open a big hospital where poor patients can be treated and operated for free,” he said. The actor claimed there are 53,000 emails and 8,000 messages on his WhatsApp which his team has yet to attend, where people have sought help. Sood claimed I-T officials said there was no problem with his books and appreciated his good work. He said, “I provided them all documents and will do the same in future if more documents are needed. Officials talked good about my work and I am cooperating with them.” The I-T department also raised doubts after stating that the actor’s foundation collected donations of Rs 18.94 crore from April this year and utilised Rs 1.9 crore towards various relief works, while the rest of the money was lying in the foundation’s account. “I am spending all the money donated to my foundation according to the needs of the poor, there is a time limit to use the donation amount, and we are using it according to rules,” the actor said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/will-not-let-politics-be-a-barrier-to-charity-in-mumbai-sood/articleshow/86383280.cms||Vijay V Singh
---||Kolkata||Pumps work overtime but Dhakuria, Jodhpur Park, Lake Gardens remain waterlogged||Kolkata: Thousands of south Kolkata residents woke up to find themselves marooned on Monday morning. Water gushed into several housing complexes and multi-storeyed buildings in Jodhpur Park, Lake Gardens, Dhakuria and the adjacent neighbourhoods. Amid severe waterlogging, power went off in some of these areas. Standalone buildings were flooded in some parts of Jodhpur Park and along NSC Bose Road. Amit Ghosh, a retired banker and a resident of Lake Gardens, was taken aback by the sight of his lawn and garage that went under knee-deep water. “I had to see an ailing friend in north Kolkata. But I dared not to venture out as my garage was flooded. I don't know what is in store for my car. I have been a resident of Lake Gardens for the past three decades but have never seen such an inundation,” Ghosh said. A government housing in the Lake Gardens area also went under water. The residents found it difficult to move out even for buying essentials, conceded a KMC drainage department official. According to a KMC drainage department official, the Jodhpur Park-Lake Gardens belt received a record 147mm rain since Sunday night. “This is one of the highest rainfall recorded in a decade. The drainage network couldn’t drain out such volume of water ,” said a KMC official. The Gariahat-Ballygunge belt and Syed Amir Ali Avenue witnessed severe waterlogging as all major drainage pumping stations like Ballygunge, Jodhpur Park or Topsia were over-burdened. Water didn’t recede from several stretches of Southern Avenue, Lake Road, Sarat Bose Road till late in the evening. Suman Chatterjee, a resident of Lake Road, needed to engage labourers to flush out water from the ground floor of his three-storey building. “Now I am scared of thinking of a fresh spell that will make the situation worse,” Chatterjee said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pumps-work-overtime-but-dhakuria-jodhpur-park-lake-gardens-remain-waterlogged/articleshow/86379372.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Lucknow||4 days on, roads still choked with rainwater, Lucknow Municipal Corporation missing||LUCKNOW: The problems arising out of water accumulation and damaged roads in several areas of the city after heavy downpour on Thursday could not be resolved by the Lucknow Municipal Corporation till Monday evening. Though the civic body claimed that it has addressed nearly 95% of the complaints received at its control room, residents of some localities told TOI that they have been struggling for the past four days with no help from any civic agency. As per the data provided by LMC control room cell, the municipal corporation received about 912 complaints related to road caving in, water-logging and fallen trees between September 16 and 19 on helpline numbers 6389300137, 6389300138 and 6389300139. The LMC officials claimed that they have resolved 862 complaints, while the rest are under the process of being addressed. However, several residents from different areas of the city told TOI that their grievances are still unattended. In Nirala Nagar, an inner lane connecting Mayanagar to No. 8 Crossing was found in a dilapidated condition. Residents of the area told TOI that the entire stretch has been damaged very badly and some parts of the road have cracked or caved in due to heavy rain. Smita Upadhyay of Niralanagar said, “After repeated attempts to connect to the control room, our call was picked up by the operator and he said that a team will reach our area soon to inspect. But, it has been two days now and no one from the LMC has come. The stretch can prove to be fatal for commuters, especially during night.” A similar situation was found on the University Road where a portion of road caved in on September 16. Manish Raj, a shopkeeper on the route, said, “A two-wheeler rider suffered injuries on his ankle and toe after the rear wheel of his scooter got stuck in the hole and he lost his balance. My son had lodged a complaint with the civic body on September 17, but nothing happened. So, we have put a tree branch on the hole to alert commuters.” In Aliganj Sec-K, the drain water is overflowing on the road due to damaged manholes. “For the past four days, drain water has accumulated on footpaths, leaving no space for pedestrians to walk or people to move out from our houses,” said Karishma Sonker of Sector K. Residents of Aishbagh area have also reported a similar grievance of damaged manholes .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/4-days-on-roads-still-choked-with-rainwater-lmc-missing/articleshow/86381607.cms||Pranchal Srivastava

ADCP, East, Qasim Abdi said, “The arrested man is an advocate by profession and is mentally unstable. He has been sent for medical examination and an investigation is underway. The accused told police that he was offended as the judge had once made a tough remark against his colleague Sundar Lal.” The accused, Kailash Bahadur Singh, sent a WhatsApp message to Justice Arora on Saturday introducing himself as a ‘Bahubali vidhayak pratyashi’ (a strongman and UP assembly election candidate) from Pratapgarh. “Mr DK Arora, I am not Sundar Lal. I am Kailash Bahadur Singh from Pratapgarh. Jo Sundar Lal ke saath hua unhone jhel liya, main on dais aakar goli maar dunga. Bahubali vidhayak pratyashi. (Sunder Lal was patient enough to bear whatever happened to him. But I am not Sundar Lal. I will shoot you in the court),” the message read. After receiving the message, Justice Arora immediately informed administrative member/registrar of Uttar Pradesh Real Estate Appellate Tribunal, Rajiv Misra. A case was registered at the SGPGI police station. Letters were sent to senior government officials, including additional chief secretary (home), director general of police and Lucknow police commissioner.

CBM would be extracted from Jharia Block I under leasehold area of BCCL. The CBM extraction is part of CIL’s diversification exercise. While BCCL would be putting up close to Rs 370 crore towards the cost of the land, the rest will be met by the CBM developer. CIL has assigned CMPDI, its Ranchi-based consultancy arm, as the principal implementing agency to oversee the project. CIL chairman Pramod Agrawal and Binay Dayal, director (technical) of the Coal major, were virtually present during the inking of the contract. “This is an important development and with this CIL would be stepping into a new era of CBM extraction on its own in its leasehold area,” said a senior official of CIL. Spread over an area of approximately 27 sq km, Jharia CBM Block-I has a resource of around 25 billion cubic metres (BCM). Average production capacity is pegged at 1.3 million metric standard cubic metres per day once the commercial operation begins. The project is scheduled in three phases. The first phase of exploration is of two-year duration from the signing of the contract followed by the pilot phase of three years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/cil-arm-inks-rs-1880cr-deal-with-cbm-developer/articleshow/86379454.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Convict’s ‘forced vax’ plea against cops, doctor rejected||MUMBAI: A sessions court on Friday rejected a 33-page plea made by a recently convicted child sexual abuser now serving a 15-year sentence, after he sought action against police officials and a doctor for “forcibly vaccinating” him before taking him to Arthur Road jail. The accused, a school sweeper who was out on bail, was taken into custody after he was convicted last month for repeatedly raping a student. While he was sentenced on Friday, in the interim, soon after he was held guilty, he moved this plea. Rejecting his plea, the special Pocso court said, “The accused claims that he had not made aware anybody that he is not intending to take vaccination. Therefore, it can’t be said that there was forceful vaccination. Moreover, it is mandatory to admit the accused in prison after vaccination (accused above 45 years),” the court said. The advocate for the accused submitted he had already filed a writ petition before the Bombay high court against compulsory vaccination. The accused said after watching a video, he was convinced that the vaccine does not give protection against Covid-19. “The accused is at liberty to approach the proper authority for relaxation of condition of making vaccination compulsory. This court is not having any jurisdiction to deal with the said subject,” said the special Pocso court that convicted him. In its reply, the jail authorities submitted that the accused was brought to Arthur Road Jail on August 18. It is further submitted that in view of the high court’s directions, it is mandatory to get accused over the age of 45 vaccinated. Moreover, in May meetings of the high-powered committee, directions were given for RT-PCR tests and vaccination of the accused. The jail authorities submitted that vaccination is important, looking into the health of the prisoners. Nobody was vaccinated against their wish though. When the court enquired with the accused, he admitted to have not told the police or the jail staff that he did not want to get vaccinated. The court said the accused had not claimed that he was handcuffed while being taken to jail. “Therefore, it appears that the accused did not object while the RT-PCR test and vaccination was done. Therefore, the contention made in the application that the accused was forcibly vaccinated is devoid of any merit. In fact, it appears that he is not aware about the contents of the present application,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-convicts-forced-vax-plea-against-cops-doc-rejected/articleshow/86381728.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Close shave as roof caves in hours before school in Narhi||LUCKNOW: Lying neglected for long, the dilapidated ceilings of two classrooms of Government Girls’ Inter College in Narhi collapsed in the wee hours on Monday. Had the incident occurred a few hours later, it would have killed several girl students and left some crippled, said teachers and students. When they arrived in the morning, they were shell shocked to see classroom furniture crushed under bricks, logs and debris. About 50 students, mostly from poor families, are enrolled in classes 6 and 8 held in these rooms. After the incident, classes were held in the open on Monday, but had to be suspended for a couple of hours during the day due to hot and humid conditions. School authorities have made temporary arrangements to run classes of these students in a nearby primary school from Tuesday. “We have been raising the issue of dilapidated school buildings with education department officers for a long time, but none paid heed to our pleas. Thursday’s rains proved to be the last straw. The roofs of both classrooms have been leaking since then,” said a teacher. Similar will be the fate of other classrooms if immediate steps are not taken, she added. School principal Rupam Singh said, “I took charge just a month ago. Earlier, letters were written to the education directorate about the poor condition of the school building. We have informed the office of the district inspector of schools (DIOS) about Monday’s incident.” Overall, 140 students are enrolled in the school that runs classes from 6 to 12 in six rooms. Teachers said that some officers had even inspected the school building earlier, but nothing was done. The post of DIOS is lying vacant at present. DIOS II Dinesh Rathore, who recently met with an accident, is on leave. Associate DIOS Rita Singh was not available for comments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/close-shave-as-roof-caves-in-hrs-before-school/articleshow/86381710.cms||Mohita Tewari

In a statement here on Monday V Sanalkumar, brother of Saseendran said, “The fresh vigilance probe is ordered when the trial of the chargesheet filed in the Thrissur vigilance court is about to start. This is an attempt to help those chargesheeted by the central bureau of investigation (CBI) and the vigilance. Sanalkumar said that he had sent letters to chief justice of Kerala high court, chief minister, chief secretary and the vigilance director against the move to sabotage the vigilance cases. Saseendran was forced to resign from the company secretary post as he had given evidence before the vigilance on the corruption cases at MCL. A few days after the evidences were given, Saseendran and his two teenage sons were found hanging in their house at Kanjikode under mysterious circumstances, the statement said. The government giving a clean chit to the accused in the corruption cases was rejected by the vigilance court. In spite of that, fresh vigilance inquiry was now ordered when the chargesheets are pending for trial for the last 10 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/fresh-probe-aimed-at-sabotaging-case/articleshow/86381721.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Thane||Thane: Trouble for Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation as sewage leaks into fresh water||THANE: After an incident of sewage water getting mixed up with drinking water supply at the Khemani nullah area, a complaint has been lodged against Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation (UMC) for criminal negligence. Environmentalist D Stalin has sent copies of the complaint letter to the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board and state environment department, among other authorities. Talking to TOI, Stalin said, “It is beyond shocking that the Ulhasnagar civic body has put public health at risk by not doing much to stop the mixing of raw sewage water with drinking water. I have video evidence of this incident which took place on September 17. However, since the pumping station at the site is still not functioning, more sewage water could be entering the drinking water supply.” He added that the work to block the dirty gutter water from flowing into the fresh Ulhas river water supply has also failed, resulting in contamination of drinking water. “We are dismayed by the fact that despite the Ulhas river case being monitored by the Supreme Court, there is hardly any seriousness on the part of the polluter, be it industries or urban bodies like UMC, to stop this reckless endangering of human lives. We urge you to initiate criminal proceedings against the guilty officers. A permanent diversion must be made on a war footing to avoid any such incidents in the future,” Stalin wrote in his complaint. When TOI contacted UMC on Monday, the PRO, Yuvraj Bhadane, acknowledged that the pumping station that was diverting the sewage water was not working for the past few weeks. “The pumping station is shut since July 22, as rainwater had entered inside causing technical damage. The repairs are being made, so the pumping station is expected to start again in the next three to four days,” said Bhadane. “But due to rains, the water overflowing into the Ulhas river is less contaminated than normal days,” he added. Meanwhile, Stalin stated, “There cannot be any justification for this criminal lapse. After decades of pollution, we thought we had managed to somehow stem the rot at Khemani nullah. But now it is evident that the system is prone to failure and both people’s dignity and life are at risk.”  He further added that a complete ban on new constructions in Ulhasnagar area is needed to prevent this situation from getting worse.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/mumbai-trouble-for-umc-as-sewage-leaks-into-fresh-water/articleshow/86383309.cms||Vijay Singh

The state forest department will keep the rescued wildlife under quarantine for 29 days at the centre. As many as 266 Indian tent turtles and Indian roofed turtles were airlifted from Hyderabad to Lucknow by the state forest department and the Turtle Survival Alliance (TSA) on Sunday. The roofed turtle is a protected species. Principal chief conservator of forests, wildlife, Pawan Kumar Sharma, said, “The two offenders detained in Hyderabad confessed to have poached the turtles from the Gomti river near Lucknow.” The turtles were temporarily housed in Nehru Zoological Park, Hyderabad, for safe custody. The turtles would be released in the Gomti around mid-October. This was the second time that such a large number of turtles have been rescued by the state forest department from outside Uttar Pradesh and rehabilitated in the wild.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/turtles-poached-from-gomti-rescued-in-hyd/articleshow/86381744.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||NDPS court rejects default bail plea relying on Bombay HC ruling||MUMBAI: Relying on a Bombay high court ruling, a special NDPS court rejected the default bail plea of an accused who sought relief as the chargesheet filed without a chemical analysis (CA) report was “incomplete”. Hence, it could not be said to be filed within the stipulated time of 180 days since the arrest. Special public prosecutor for NCB, Advait M Sethna, had opposed the plea. The court said a day prior to the rejection order, HC clarified that a chargesheet filed without CA report was not incomplete and the accused cannot insist on default bail. A co-accused in the case was granted bail earlier on grounds of an incomplete chargesheet. Refusing to grant bail to Ibrahim Mujawar, the court said in view of change in position of law, it was crystal clear he was not entitled to default bail as the chargesheet filed without the report was incomplete. “Though the applicant prayed for release on the ground of parity, the court is bound by law of precedent, so the accused is not entitled to be released on bail,” the court said. The accused was arrested in February after a commercial quantity of drugs was allegedly recovered from him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ndps-court-rejects-default-bail-plea-relying-on-hc-ruling/articleshow/86383316.cms||---

A division bench of Chief Justice S Manikumar and Justice Shaji P Chaly considered the PIL by PD Joseph of Thrissur. It was alleged that camp followers are engaged as house slaves by IPS officers. The court dismissed the plea on the basis of an affidavit filed by assistant inspector general of police (PG) of police headquarters stating that the government has decided to conduct recruitment of camp followers through Kerala Public Service Commission and special rules for their recruitment and service conditions are being finalized. Further, the affidavit denied the allegation that camp followers are working like slaves at the houses of IPS officers. “The camp followers are not deployed for domestic work of IPS officers, they are deployed to a few of the Camps Offices at the District, Battalions or Ranges only,” the affidavit stated. The duty of camp followers is to undertake camp support and house-keeping activities in police camps and camp offices, the court was told.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hc-dismisses-pil-on-police-camp-followers-exploitation/articleshow/86381781.cms||---

---||Kochi||They fought and called it quits, for now||Kochi: It was an unusual fight that caught the eye of forest officials who were on patrol duty on Sunday. A King cobra and a monitor lizard locked in a tight struggle at Perumani forest station in Thundathil range. The video captured by the patrol team went viral too. In the video, the snake is seen biting the lizard’s tail while the latter is trying to escape. As the tussle on the road continued, the monitor lizard bit the snake in a counterattack. “This encounter continued for around 15 minutes. Later, both of them ended their struggle and moved to the opposite side in a bid to escape. Others who caught the incident on their mobiles said the encounter started even before the patrol team arrived. The area is frequented by both species,” said range officer Mohammed Rafy. Though it is claimed that the venom from the snake might not have entered the lizard’s body, experts felt that the King cobra would return to catch its prey. “Monitor lizard is a part of King cobra’s diet. Though the venom of King cobra is less potent compared to the krait, the quantity of venom it delivers in one bite matters more. The presence of people might have forced the King cobra to release the lizard and leave the area. However, that lizard is unlikely to survive as the King cobra will track it down,” said Dr Jafar Palot, a reptile expert at the Zoological Survey of India. This is not the first encounter between a King cobra and a monitor lizard in Kerala. A similar event was recorded near Kakkayam reservoir seven years ago. “A group of school students noticed the encounter near the dam seven years ago. As the news spread, more people reached the spot forcing the King cobra to leave the lizard on the road side. But, it returned to the spot after 35 minutes. By that time, the prey was exhausted and the snake ate it. The nail of a monitor lizard is so sharp that it can injure the snake. So, the king cobra eats it only after the animal is exhausted,” said Surendran, a snake rescuer in Peruvannamuzhi. Later, that King cobra was moved to a rescue centre and the snake took seven days to digest its meal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/they-fought-and-called-it-quits-for-now/articleshow/86381819.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||Why students at Delhi University’s School of Open Learning are left in a lurch||NEW DELHI: The shortfall in faculty strength and the principal not being a permanent appointee have affected the admission registration process at Delhi University’s School of Open Learning, leaving close to one lakh students waiting in suspense. Every year, admission at SOL starts either along with or a little later than the registration at the regular colleges. While such registration started on June 1 in 2019, the pandemic forced the delay of the process till October 19 last year. This year, the admission registration for the undergraduate courses in 63 DU colleges got over on August 31 and the cutoffs for admission are likely next week. “Under new regulations, we have to apply for approval from UGC’s Distance Education Bureau (DBE),” said U S Pandey, officiating principal, SOL. DBE has raised some queries now, holding up the start of the process. Balram Pani, DU’s dean of colleges, confirmed the DBE’s questions regarding two necessary parameters for granting approval to SOL. “They have asked about the number of teachers at SOL and have pointed out that they find the faculty strength less than the norm, and therefore, not adequate. They have also questioned why the principal’s position hasn’t been filled permanently. We have told DBE that the appointment of principal will be done as soon as the new vice-chancellor takes over in DU,” said Pani. As of now, SOL has 18 permanent and 6 ad hoc teachers teaching both the undergraduate and postgraduate courses. “For commerce and political science, where both undergraduate and postgraduate courses are offered, the number of teachers as per norms is less,” said Pandey. According to Pani, unlike in the other distancing learning institution in DU, the Non-Collegiate Women’s Education Board (NCWEB), which has teaching staff on its rolls throughout the year, it isn’t the case at SOL. NCWEB holds classes for women only on the weekends. In 2018 too, a similar problem had arisen when the delay of UGC’s approval had led to late undergraduate admissions. SOL offers undergraduate honours courses in English, political science and commerce. It also has BA and BCom programmes. Master’s degree courses are offered in commerce, history, Hindi, Sanskrit and political science. Every year, around one lakh students enrol for the distance-learning system, considered one of the largest in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-students-at-dus-sol-are-left-in-a-lurch/articleshow/86379633.cms||Shradha Chettri
---||Lucknow||Vaccination rate in Lucknow’s rural belts 3 times lower than in urban regions||LUCKNOW: The rate of Covid-19 vaccination at centres in rural areas of Lucknow is three times lower than that in urban ones, reveals an analysis of data provided by the health department on CoWin portal. According to the district election office, the city has a population of nearly 36 lakh aged 18 years or above. Of these, 23.4 lakh (65%) reside in urban areas and 12.6 lakh (35%) in the rural belt. To cover the entire population of both categories with the two-dose course, urban areas need 46.8 lakh doses and rural 25.2 lakh. According to data on CoWin portal, the district health department has administered 33.3 lakh doses so far in Lucknow district. The chief medical officer’s office said that it does not maintain any data of how many people have been vaccinated. However, the CoWin portal has data of the number of doses administered by every centre/site, both in rural and urban belts. Calculation of total shots administered by centres in rural areas shows that 4.8 lakh doses have been given at sites in suburbs or villages, which means only 19% of the shots required (25.2 lakh) for the entire rural population have been admnistered so far. In comparison, 28.5 lakh have been inoculated at centres in the city, which indicates that 61% of the total doses required (46.8 lakh) for this population have been administered. Clearly, in terms of percentage points, the pace of doses administered in urban areas is three times more than that in rural areas. The analysis also reveals that one of the main reasons why rural areas are lagging could be fewer vaccination sites and special camps. About 53 centres in rural areas are administering vaccines. However, of the total, only 11 are administering vaccines regularly. In comparison, in urban areas, at least 50 vaccination centres operate on a regular basis. These include 10 district hospitals and three medical education institutes with multiple booths. Besides, special camps at religious and workplaces function regularly. Experts opined that besides fewer vaccination sites, lack of digital literacy, ignorance and hesitancy could also be major reasons. Head of medicine department at KGMU Prof Virendra Atam said, "Many in the rural set-up still do not know the importance of vaccination. There are also several myths like vaccines cause impotence or infertility, leading to hesitancy.” Prof Vineeta Shukla of RMLIMS, said, "Besides involving gram panchayats, deployment of mobile vans can accelerate vaccination in rural areas.” CMO Dr Manoj Agrawal said that health teams are conducting door-to-door awareness in villages. What data shows A comparison of vaccination rates at rural and urban centres in the past 18 days as shown on CoWin portal revealed that sites in rural areas were administering an average 9,900 shots daily.

They said even those schools which did not even provide online classes during the pandemic are asking parents to pay the complete fee to allow their children into classrooms. “As physical classes started, I started sending my son to school. Soon after they started asking us to buy books. When I went to school to buy books, management asked me to clear the complete fee,” said a parent of class 4 student at a school in Pedda Amberpet. He claimed that last academic year, the school did not even conduct online classes. “We hired a tutor so that my son can continue his education. Why should I pay entire fee when the school did not take classes,” he questioned. Parents and teachers said that most schools were giving access to virtual classes to only those students who cleared the full fee. “Teachers were given the list of defaulters and asked not to add them to WhatsApp group or give access to online classes,” said a teacher working at a well-known city school. The teacher said that no school is promoting students without clearing dues. Some even took to Twitter to raise the issue. “Respected minister sir, Government doing well for the Development of Telangana state no doubt at all, same time please save the parents from the hands of private schools. Due to the pandemic situation unable to pay fees and the school management is not allowing children to online classes. Please do justice,” read a tweet from @md_abdulvajid to @KTRTRS. Members of Telangana Recognised School Managements Association (TRSMA), said some schools in Hyderabad, Rangareddy, Medchal, and few in Vikarabad and Sangareddy are pressuring parents to pay fee dues. “In remaining districts, hardly 15% of students are attending classes. Only those parents who are coming for TC, bonafide, or class 10 marks memo are clearing the fee,” said TRSMA president, Y Shekhar Rao. He said there are parents who have not cleared dues since the academic year 2019-20 and added that many schools are on the verge of shutting down.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/schools-block-online-access-amid-rise-in-fee-backlogs/articleshow/86379472.cms||Nirupa Vatyam
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Now, cases of mystery fever being discovered in adults too||HYDERABAD: It’s not just children, but even adults have been afflicted by the mystery fever over the past 15 days. At least 10-15 cases have been reported in several area hospitals over the last fortnight, while the state-run fever hospital has seen nearly 40 such cases. Individual private hospitals too have reported a handful of cases. As with children, the fever is usually moderate to high with no other symptoms and all tests negative. But unlike the usual self-limiting fevers where patient recovers in around a week, here the recovery is not being seen even after 10-15 days. Majority of the cases, however, are not serious in nature, maintain doctors. “We have seen roughly 15 cases in the past two-three weeks. But these are mild to moderate cases and do not require hospitalisation. We have found them to be negative for all the existing fevers, including dengue, malaria and even Covid-19. Their blood reports too are completely normal, but they have persistent fever,” said Dr M Dasrath, medical superintendent, Area Hospital, Kondapur. Incidentally, similar cases of unexplained fevers have perplexed doctors in several parts of the country. With no clear line of treatment, doctors have been left with treating individual symptoms. “Usually, these cases are considered as viral fever cases and not pursued in depth as we cannot test for every possible virus. All other tests are run on the patients including that for dengue, malaria, typhoid, Covid-19 etc. We can only give symptomatic treatment to these patients,” said a doctor from the state-run fever hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/now-cases-of-mystery-fever-being-discovered-in-adults-too/articleshow/86379374.cms||Amrita Didyala

---||Hyderabad||Stir in all districts on Sept 25 to oppose govt move to shut schools||Hyderabad: In a bid to highlight the neglect plaguing the education sector in the state and press for long-pending demands, a protest would be organised in all districts on September 25. The protesters also intend to register their opposition to state’s plan to shut down government schools in the guise of rationalisation. Organised by the Telangana Save Education Committee, the members, which include parents as well as teachers, would be meeting collectors at the district headquarters and submit a representation. “Ever since Telangana was formed, the education sector has been neglected. The budget of the education sector has been reduced to 6% in last seven years. The amount is sufficient only to pay salaries and there is no scope for improving infrastructure. Further, there are over 50,000 vacancies in educational institutions,” said K Laxminarayana, general secretary of the committee. They said that the state was planning to close down over 1,200 government schools in the name of rationalisation. The members of the committee said that even in 2014 when the state had come up with the proposal for the first time, it was the Save Education Committee which had resisted to ensure it was not implemented. “This time, however, the state is trying its best to close down schools,” a member said. In the first week of September, the committee had demanded that the state cancel GO No 25. It had also insisted that the state form a committee to study reasons for low student strength in government schools instead of just closing down or reducing the number of teachers in the name of rationalisation. They alleged that students were not joining government schools because of lack of teachers. Instead of appointing teachers and improving enrolment, the state was now showing the low strength as a reason to shut down schools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/stir-in-all-districts-on-sept-25-to-oppose-govt-move-to-shut-schools/articleshow/86379517.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation fishes out over 83,000 idols post-festivities||HYDERABAD: With the last of the Ganesh idols being immersed in water bodies across the city on Monday, the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) pressed ahead with cleaning operations on war footing. While cleaning operations had already begun following the immersion of small idols on the third day of festivities, the civic body intensified efforts on Monday as per the petition filed in Supreme Court. Altogether 83,191 Ganesh idols immersed in baby ponds and lakes in the city have been removed so far. Of these, 60,097 were immersed in baby ponds and 23,094 idols immersed in lakes were removed successfully. The civic body removed a total of 10091.923 metric tonnes of waste garbage after the Ganesh's immersion, officials said. The last of the Ganesh idols make their way to Hussainsagar on Monday“We have deployed machinery and over 1200 staff in all the six zones to remove debris and sanitize the lakes as well as immersion ponds in GHMC limits. The highest number of staff were deployed in Khairatabad zone considering the massive influx of people as well as immersion processions coming to Hussainsagar and the immersion ponds around it from different parts of the city,” said Dr A Rambabu, chief entomologist, GHMC. The GHMC petition was filed in the Supreme Court after the Telangana High Court banned the immersion of Ganesh idols made of Plaster of Paris (PoP) in the lake. “The directions issued by the High Court at this point of time would cause huge public outcry and also lead to administrative difficulties. The GHMC will ban the immersion of POP idols from the next year in light of the guidelines issued by Central Pollution Control Board. However, for this year the GHMC seeks an exemption,” the GHMC petition, filed through advocate Venkat Reddy, said. The municipal corporation’s petition had stated that the PoP idols immersed in the Hussainsagar and other lakes in the city will be removed within 24 hours of immersion and transported to solid waste dumping sites.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ghmc-fishes-out-over-83k-idols-post-festivities/articleshow/86379617.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Sharp rise in dengue, cases over twice the number recorded in Telangana last year||HYDERABAD: Dengue cases in the state are reaching a critical stage. The cases have already crossed last year’s figures and are now inching closer to the level in 2019 when dengue created havoc. As per official statistics from the state health department, 3,144 dengue cases have been reported till September 10. This is over twice the 1,293 cases reported during the same period last year. In 2019, the same period saw 4,169 cases. The sharp rise has led to doctors sounding an alert. “While there is a lot of attention on Covid-19, there is little awareness about dengue. Even a slight delay in seeking treatment can result in the patient landing in ICU. We have seen cases worsening due to a delay of one or two days,” said Dr Ravi Kumar, senior professor, Niloufer Hospital. The problem with dengue is that a patient can go from high fever to multiple organ failure within a span of two to three days. And often most people wait for a couple of days before seeking medical attention for fever — a delay that can be fatal in case of dengue. Also, dengue’s effects can range from mild infection to severe illness. “Life-threatening dengue often requires hospital care. Often, mild symptoms can be confused with other viral illnesses that cause fever, headache, rash or body pains. Generally, symptoms of dengue last for two to seven days and most kids recover after about a week,” said Dr Kanchan S Channawar, consultant paediatrician, Kamineni Hospitals.. She added, “Occasionally, it develops into a potentially lethal complication called severe dengue in one out 20 patients. It can result in shock, internal bleeding or even death. Infants and pregnant woman are at risk of severe dengue. Warning signs of severe dengue are abdominal pain or tenderness, three or more vomiting in 24 hours, blood vomiting, bleeding from nose and gums or in urine and stool, child being restless and irritable.” As per official data from the state health department, 3,144 dengue cases have been reported till September 10.

The statue is being installed as part of 1,000th birth anniversary celebrations of the acharya. PM Narendra Modi will unveil the statue, while President of India Ram Nath Kovind will participate in a programme on February 14.

The immersion, which began early on Sunday morning amid massive security arrangements, went on until 3 pm on Monday. According to Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), over 80,000 Ganesh idols of various forms and sizes were immersed in the water bodies in the city. The civic authorities along with city police had made adequate arrangements, including deployment of over 200 Ganpati Action Teams (GATs) to ensure smooth movement of procession. About 27,000 policemen were deployed under the limits of Hyderabad, Cyberabad and Rachakonda commissionerates as lakhs of people took part in the immersion, choking arterial roads as the procession wound its way to designated water bodies. A total of 40 cranes were deployed for immersion at Hussainsagar. To provide help in case of any drowning incident, authorities also deployed boats with 30 expert swimmers at the Hussainsagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/immersion-of-idols-goes-on-till-late-afternoon/articleshow/86379639.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai on the verge of 100% vaccination of senior citizens?||MUMBAI: Is the city on the verge of vaccinating almost 100% of senior citizens with at least one dose? Mumbai has a projected 11.07lakh people above the age of 60 years, while data shows that 11.08lakh (100.09%) have taken at least one Covid vaccine shot and about 8lakh senior citizens (71%) are fully inoculated. The city’s immunisation numbers invariably include people from the outlying parts of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. Thus, despite 100% coverage on paper, it is likely around 20% senior citizens who reside in Mumbai are left to be covered, said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner. Since a door-to-door survey to gauge actual coverage may yield little, the civic administration is now planning drives around building clusters. Kakani said last mile coverage would be the key to ensure every individual has got the shot. “Soon, we are going to plan an exercise where one vaccination centre would cover say 50-60 buildings in an area. It will allow us to cover whoever hasn't got the shot yet,” he said. As per BMC estimates, Mumbai has an adult population of 90.78lakh, of which 83% have got at least one dose and 35% have got both. The state, however, estimates Mumbai’s adult population to be 96lakh, a number derived from the 2011 census and with annual growth rate factored in. More recently, the state has come up with a new estimate of 92lakh, an official said. “But we generally go by the BMC’s population estimates to analyse coverage.” According to that, around 95% of the 45-59 age group have received at least one dose, while 60% have got both shots. In the 18-44 age group, 69% have got at least one jab and 16% have got both. “We have found out that 4 out of 10 people taking the vaccine in Mumbai don’t live here, but they work here. So, their vaccination would be important too to ensure the city is protected,” said Dr Sheela Jagtap, immunisation in-charge. Doctors say the impact of vaccination is visible as fewer senior citizens and critical cases are in hospital. Dr Tanu Singhal, an infectious disease expert who consults with Kokilaben Hospital, said since the trains started, the rise in cases has been marginal. “Our wards or ICUs did not fill up rapidly as we feared,” she said. Mumbai currently has less than 400 severe patients. Dr Vasant Nagvekar, a member of the state Covid task force, said the next 10 days will be crucial to understand the impact of social mingling during Ganpati.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-on-the-verge-of-100-vaccination-of-senior-citizens/articleshow/86380481.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Lucknow||Obstructive sleep apnea can be fatal: Docs||Lucknow: If you wake up multiple times at night due to breathlessness and experience dry mouth in the morning with headache and fatigue all day, it might be due to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Experts discussed various aspects of the condition at an international conference on ‘dental sleep medicine’ on Monday. About 40 lakh people, particularly the elderly and obese, suffer from OSA in India, they said. In respiratory medicine, OSA is usually treated with continuous positive airway pressure machines, but dentistry also offers easy management. “Obesity, lifestyle stress and complete tooth fall can cause compression in the upper airway. This adversely affects breathing. If such a condition persists for long and is left untreated, it impacts the body’s oxygen requirement and may cause heart and respiratory issues,” said Prof Arvind Tripathi, dean of Saraswati Dental College and organiser of the conference. In dentistry, experts said, the condition can be treated with mandibular advancement device, an oral device that temporarily moves the jaw and tongue forward, which reduces throat constriction and increases airway space. “About 80% patients do not know they suffer from OSA and that it can be fatal, hence people should have basic knowledge about it,” said Dr Ankur of World Health Organization’s Lucknow office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/obstructive-sleep-apnea-can-be-fatal-docs/articleshow/86381883.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Venkatesan who attempted to escape fell down and sustained injuries. He also allegedly attempted to assault the policemen using a knife.Later, the police team secured Venkatesan and took him to the Emaneswaram police station where he was allegedly assaulted by the policemen. Venkatesan who sustained injuries died at the hospital. Police had initially registered a case under Section 176 (1-A) of CrPC. The case was subsequently transferred to Ramanathapuram district CB-CID in 2018 and the case was altered under various sections including Section 302 of IPC.Justice G Ilangovan observed that since it is a custodial death, the entire case diary files were called for and perused. Perusal of the case diary file shows that a specific allegation has been made against the petitioner as he had along with other policemen assaulted the deceased person.The judge also said that it is unfortunate that even after a lapse of three years, the investigation is yet to be completed.The judge took note of the fact that the petitioner’s earlier plea seeking anticipatory bail was also dismissed by this court. Since it is a case of custodial death, the petitioner is not entitled to get relief of anticipatory bail, unless and until he is able to bring on record the materials or circumstances, which are compelling in nature, for this court to exercise its discretionary power, observed the judge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-denies-advance-bail-to-cop-in-custodial-death-case/articleshow/86381866.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||Delhi||Northeast Delhi riots: Court frames charges against five for setting shop on fire||NEW DELHI: A Delhi court has framed charges against five people in a northeast Delhi riots case, saying in terms of the written complaint and statement of the witnesses, accused people can be allegedly said to be part of the unlawful assembly that purportedly used violence with weapons during rioting. Additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat framed charges for the offences of rioting, unlawful assembly, mischief causing damage to the amount of Rs 50, mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to destroy house, theft in dwelling house against Gurmeet Singh, Gaurav, Deepak Tomar, Raj Kamal and Vikram in the matter. The case pertained to alleged vandalism and setting on fire of a barber shop by a riotous mob in Jyoti Nagar area during the communal violence.  The court said that the contention of the accused’s counsel regarding veracity of the witnesses was not to be judged at the stage of framing of charges and could only be considered after their examination during trial. “In terms of the written complaint of Imran and statement of the witnesses particularly public witness Rafiq and Constable Bijender under Section 161 CrPC, accused people namely Gurmeet Singh, Gaurav, Deepak Tomar, Raj Kamal and Vikram can be said to be part of the unlawful assembly that used force/violence with weapons of offence in the prosecution of the common object of rioting/mischief...,” it said in the order. It further said that there was violation of the prohibitory order under Section 144 CrPC dated February 24, 2020, issued by DCP (NE), for the entire northeast district of Delhi, whereby an assembly of more than four people and any demonstration or carrying any weapon or material, which can be used for violence in the area, was prohibited from February 24 till March 24. The accused claimed they were falsely implicated in the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ne-delhi-riots-court-frames-charges-against-five-for-setting-shop-on-fire/articleshow/86379693.cms||Usha Das
---||Madurai||FIR against man who violated norms quashed||Madurai: Observing that an unintended casual act should not take away the future of a graduate who is looking for an employment abroad, the Madras high court quashed the FIR registered against a man who was travelling in his two-wheeler during Covid-19 lockdown in Madurai district, last year.The court passed the order while hearing the petition filed by V Karthikraja, who sought to quash the FIR registered against him by the Keelavalavu police station in Madurai district.The case of the prosecution is that while Section 144 CrPC was in effect due to Covid-19 pandemic, the petitioner on April 22, 2020 went outside in his two-wheeler without any proper reason. A case was registered against him under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and Section 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of IPC.Justice G Ilangovan observed that insofar as the offence under Section 269 of IPC, the petitioner was simply riding in his two-wheeler. It is a trivial matter in which no offence of grievous nature is involved. Though the order under Section 144 of CrPC was in effect, the police should have warned the petitioner to stay indoors, instead, they registered a case against him.“It is also not the case of the police that at the time of the incident, the petitioner was affected by Covid-19. So the contention that riding in a two-wheeler during the pandemic period will spread the disease is without any basis,” observed the judge.The judge observed that there is no material to show that before registering the case under Section 188 of IPC, permission from the concerned jurisdictional magistrate has been obtained.The judge observed that it is also brought to the notice of this court that the government is also going to drop all these cases which have been registered during the pandemic period against the public.The judge observed that the petitioner has completed his graduation, had applied for a passport as he is trying for a job abroad. Due to the pendency of this case, the passport authorities had issued a clarification notice to the petitioner. Observing that the future of the petitioner should not be spoiled for this unintended act of travelling during the lockdown period, the judge quashed the FIR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/fir-against-man-who-violated-norms-quashed/articleshow/86381855.cms||Kaushik Kannan

Their pleas contend the special CBI court judge “gravely erred in observing that the accusations” against them prima facie showed complicity with other co-accused in having fraudulently and dishonestly received loans of over Rs 600 crore “as quid pro quo for favour shown by Yes Bank Ltd. to Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DHFL)”. The trio is at Byculla women’s jail, so there is no urgency, said CBI counsel H S Venegaonkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-bail-pleas-of-ranas-kin-to-be-heard-tomorrow/articleshow/86381917.cms||---

---||Madurai||Lay quality roads, ensure upkeep of drains in Madurai, says plea in HC||Madurai: The Madras high court on Monday sought a response from Madurai Corporation on a plea which sought to lay quality roads and to ensure proper maintenance of the stormwater drains within the city limits.A division bench of justices M Duraiswamy and K Murali Shankar sought the response on a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by an advocate S Suresh Kumar Isaac Paul, a resident of Madurai.The petitioner stated that the corporation authorities carry out the process of laying several roads in the city periodically. The roads which are laid are not of proper quality due to which it gets damaged within a year and gets washed away during heavy rainfall. The corporation also carries out the road laying work without consulting other departments such as the electricity board. Due to lack of such coordination, the newly-laid roads are dug up within a few days.Though the authorities are carrying out the work to widen the roads in certain congested areas in the city, the purpose is not served as they fail to remove the electric poles and trees which are causing hindrance to vehicular movement, he stated.He stated that the process of laying new roads is carried out by the authorities without scrapping or milling the existing roads, despite the government’s guidelines and earlier high court orders in this regard. Due to this reason, the height of the road increases and several people even face difficulties to take their vehicle outside their houses.Whenever new roads are laid in the city, the work should be carried out only after scrapping or milling the existing old road. When a new road is laid by the corporation, then a board should be erected containing details about the budget, composition used for laying the road, name of the contractor, lifespan of the road and phone numbers for the people to address their grievances.He stated that the stormwater drains in the city are also not maintained in a proper manner. Stormwater drains get clogged with waste materials due to which the rain water remains stagnant at the roads eventually damaging the roads. He stated that effective steps should also be taken by the corporation authorities for the proper maintenance of stormwater drains.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/lay-quality-roads-ensure-upkeep-of-drains-in-madurai-says-plea-in-hc/articleshow/86381881.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Mahant Narendra Giri’s differences with his disciple had been resolved||Prayagraj: Mahant Narendra Giri, 62, was elected as president of Akhil Bhartiya Akhara Parishad (ABAP) in 2014 and re-elected to the all-important post on October 10, 2019 at a meeting held at Haridwar. ABAP is the apex decision body of the 13 recognised Hindu religious monastic orders of the country. The serving secretary of the Shri Panchayati Akhara Niranjani, Narendra Giri, hailed from trans-Ganga area of Prayagraj. Having close proximity with both BJP and SP, Narendra Giri had a fallout with his disciple and noted Yoga guru and the then “Chhote Mahant” of Bade Hanuman Temple, Swami Anand Giri, in May this year. Following this, Anand Giri was expelled from Baghambari Math and Niranjani Akhara as well. Anand Giri had been accused of continuing to have connections with his family in violation of the set norms of conduct for sanyasis. He was also accused of indulging in financial irregularities associated with the temple fund, a fact that was confirmed by secretary of the akhara, Shri Mahant Swami Ravindra Puri. Anand Giri had also reached the PMO and UP CM with his complaint against his guru. The action against Anand Giri had followed a complaint against him in this regard by Narendra Giri. However, within a few days, Anand Giri had formally sought forgiveness from Narendra Giri and the Panch Parmeshwar of the Shri Panchayati Akhara Niranjani. Narendra Giri had then forgiven him and also lifted the ban on Anand Giri from entering Bade Hanuman temple and the Baghambari Mutt that had been imposed on him at the time of expulsion. Anand Giri was detained in Haridwar on Monday after his name surfaced in the suicide note of his guru.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/mahant-narendra-giris-differences-with-his-disciple-had-been-resolved/articleshow/86381937.cms||---

Police have identified the deceased as P Murugan, 28, of Mela Eral village in Tuticorin district. Murugan, who was a Class X dropout, worked with his father in their field. On September 15, his body was found in bushes in Melakaranthai village with an injury on his head. The Masarpatti police registered a case of suspicious death under Section 174 of the CrPC and sent the body for postmortem. Police, who checked CCTV footages from Ettayapuram, saw another man accompanying Murugan on September 14. Going through his call details, police came to know that he frequently spoke to a man, identified as M Murugan, 24, of Dhamaal in Kancheepuram district. He worked in a car accessories manufacturing company. Police said the man from Tuticorin impersonated a woman and befriended the Kancheepuram man on Facebook two years ago. They started talking over phone in which the impersonator had used an app to change his voice. A shock awaited the Kancheepuram man when he met his virtual lover on the occasion of Valentine’s Day (February 14) at the Mattuthavani bus stand in Madurai. As an argument broke out, the Kancheepuram man was pacified by P Murugan. The latter also convinced him to have a homosexual relationship that day and secretly clicked the pictures. Disgusted over the turn of events, M Murugan abandoned his mobile number and got a new one, but the impersonator managed to get hold of it. He then threatened the Kancheepuram man to marry him, failing which he would share the pictures of their relationship with his family. On September 14, M Murugan came to Ettayapuram to meet the impersonator and requested him to delete the content. They went to Melakaranthai to consume alcohol where the accused laced the victim’s drink with poison and killed him by crushing his head with a stone. The case was altered as murder. The accused was produced before the Vilathikulam judicial magistrate and remanded.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/gay-man-murdered-for-threatening-to-release-pics-of-affair/articleshow/86381967.cms||---

The minister made this statement in response to the statement made by his predecessor and AIADMK coordinator O Panneerselvam, asking the DMK government if they had changed its stand with regard to bringing fuel under GST from their tenure as the opposition and on assuming power. Thiagarajan pointed out that the Union government is levying heavy cess of Rs 32.9 per litre petrol and Rs 31.8 on a litre of diesel, which goes undivided with the states. He said that GST introduced in 2017 has taken away all 75% taxation rights of all the states, leaving them with only fuel and liquor under their control. None of the state governments are ready to give up their rights on fuel under these pressing conditions as it would further burden them and disturb their finance management and criticised the BJP government of burdening the common man with heavy taxes on fuel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/tn-will-consider-gst-on-fuel-if-centre-drops-cess/articleshow/86381955.cms||---

Principal secretary, basic education, Deepak Kumar issued an order to the director general, school education Anamika Singh on Monday, stating, “Instructions have come from the chief minister to release the first phase of DBT in September only.” Around 1.6 crore children are enrolled in classes 1 to 8 of UP government schools. In March, TOI had first reported the government’s decision of DBT from academic session 2021-22 with the aim of eliminating middlemen and complaints of quality of uniforms provided to students earlier. Deepak Kumar said the department will ink an agreement with UP Development Systems Corporation Limited (UPDESCO) and Shreetron India. UPESCO will support the integration of database, dashboard of Prerna portal and Prerna mobile application with Public Financial Management System (PFMS) portal through which DBT transactions are done, while Shreetron Limited will take care of Aadhaar verification of beneficiaries. Since extensive work needs to be done in a short span, the students’ eligibility for money transfer via DBT to the Aadhaar seeded bank accounts of parents will be the same as in previous years, he added.  The basic education directorate will launch Prerna app that will be used by teachers to fetch information on the number of students besides Aadhaar and bank details of parents. Head teachers have been told to hold meetings with parents to inform them about the DBT scheme and ensure their bank accounts are seeded so that no beneficiary is left out. The teachers have also been entrusted with the verification of details to ensure error-free data. Education officers have been asked to get the details of students uploaded on Prerna portal. The central and state governments provide two sets of uniforms to students of classes 1 to 8 at an average cost of Rs 600 per annum. In addition, the UP government provides Rs 200 for a sweater, Rs 135 for shoes, Rs 100 for a bag, and Rs 21 for a pair of socks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/govt-to-start-dbt-for-uniforms-in-parents-accounts-this-month/articleshow/86382088.cms||Isha Jain

The total number of beneficiaries taking the first dose has reached 5.32 lakh within municipal limits of Aurangabad, which account for around 45%. While the city has over 2.5 lakh citizens, who have been received both doses. Dr Neeta Padalkar, the health officer with Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), on Monday said vaccination hesitancy among certain sections of the society has led to the recent slow progress of the first dose vaccination. “Despite a slew of awareness measures, certain people are still reluctant to take the vaccine. Either the fear of the vaccine and overconfidence that they cannot contract the infection are the two reasons behind many still not getting vaccinated. Both these claims are irrational and could prove life-threatening,” she said. While the civic administration has set a target population of 11.77 lakh for vaccination, Padalakar said at least 75% of the total target should be achieved over the next few weeks. “Experts from abroad and India have cited the fears of the possible third wave of Covid. In view of such projections, it is prudent for citizens to get immunized with both the doses at the earliest,” she said, adding that the civic body has sufficient stock of both Covishield and Covaxin. Meanwhile, with nine fresh cases of Covid on Sunday, the total number of active cases in Aurangabad has reached 56.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/more-takers-for-second-dose-of-vaccine-in-aurangabad-city/articleshow/86375339.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

We have asked citizens to be alert and also circulated a documentary done by the Maharashtra forest department which advises citizens on their role when a leopard is seen prowling in their area,” he said.Deputy commissioner Nitesh Patil also issued an order cancelling all offline classes in Kendriya Vidyalaya, Raj Nagar, following the search operation. The school will continue with online classes till the leopard is caught, said the order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/combing-ops-to-begin-soon-to-nab-leopard-dcf/articleshow/86375311.cms||Basavaraj Kattimani
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Housing societies seek more time to hold AGMs, submit audits||MUMBAI: The state cooperatives commissioner recommended to the state extension of date for holding housing society AGMs for a year (till March 2022) following increasing demands from housing societies in Mumbai metropolitan region. These AGMs mainly clear audits of previous years and appoint auditors for the new fiscal. The commissioner also proposed extension of deadline for submitting audited accounts till December this year. AGMs and submission of audited accounts have a September 30 deadline, which is being opposed by societies as it’s a “very short period to issue notices to members who have travelled outside or have just resumed duty”. An extension of nine months to audit submissions and year-long extension for AGMs was given last year too due to Covid, experts said. Similarly, as per a recent circular, society elections can be held within six months from September 16 (till March 15, 2022). All society associations have backed these recommendations, which await the cooperatives’ department nod at Mantralaya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hsg-socs-seek-more-time-to-hold-agms-submit-audits/articleshow/86382074.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar

The shifting process, in which around 30 people have been engaged, is likely to be completed by Friday. The trees are being relocated within the same campus with the help of a crane and an earthmover.In the third week of August, the branches and roots were trimmed and the trees were allowed to give time for new shoots and roots to come out, so that they would grow well after transplanting. The pruned portions were covered with cow dung and wrapped with wet sacks to prevent drying and for the new leaves to grow. Pits were dug up and prepared with manure and water.Environmental activist Syed Kattuva of Marangaluku Maruvazhu Amaippu (New Lease of Life for Trees Movement), who is carrying out the relocation work, said that trees with their branches and roots pruned three weeks ago have started growing new leaves and roots. “This was possible due to the rain the city had received over the last few days, coupled with care given by people,” he said.Chances of their survival is high as they are transplanted only 10 to 50 feet away from the original spots and within the same campus. The condition of soil and environment is almost the same. The activist hoped that all the trees would survive as all of them had new green leaves. The team engaged in the relocation include 15 experts in the field from Coimbatore. Four trees were transplanted on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/relocation-of-trees-begins-for-construction-of-library/articleshow/86382050.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: Paying board fees turns to be the real test for govt school students||NEW DELHI: Chanchal, a Class X student of a Delhi government school in Mangolpuri, is worried because her class teacher has been asking her to submit the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE)’s registration fees. She does not have her father and her mother lost her job due to Covid pandemic. Chanchal is one of many government school students who are struggling to pay the registration fees for board exams. Only about 20 to 30% of students in most government schools have paid the fees so far. The last date for payment of fees is September 30. For Class XII, the fee is around Rs 2,400 for general category students. For Class X students, it comes to around Rs 1,800. If any candidate opts for seven papers, he/she will have to pay Rs 2,100. Sunil Kumar Joon, English teacher at Government Boys Senior Secondary School, Ghitorni, said, “In our school, only around 20% of students have paid the fees. There were many failed Class IX students who also wanted to join the National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS), but as they were not able to pay the fees, they decided to repeat Class IX.” In Delhi government schools, students who fail to clear Class IX can take admission in Class X as part of NIOS. Even at Government Girls Senior Secondary School, only about 30% students have paid the fees so far. “It is difficult for the students to pay at this point of time,” said Aruna Anand, principal of the school. All India Parents’ Association (AIPA) has written to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal requesting him to help these students. Ashok Agarwal, president of AIPA, said, “From across the city, we have been getting requests from parents seeking fee relaxation. They have expressed their inability to pay the fees as many do not have jobs or are earning too less. Now that the government’s financial situation is improving, they should think about helping these children.” The parents’ association has also asked the students to write postcards to lieutenant governor Anil Baijal seeking help. Last year, several teachers, social welfare organisations and individuals had come forward to extend help to the poor students in paying the board exam fees. In 2019, Delhi government had paid the fees for all the children studying in its schools. The parents of many students in the capital have lost their jobs because of the pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/paying-board-fees-turns-to-be-the-real-test-for-govt-school-students/articleshow/86379866.cms||---
---||Mumbai||To stop tribal deaths is top priority: Bombay HC||MUMBAI: Tribals must be brought into mainstream for healthcare, Bombay high court said on Monday while hearing PILs on malnutrition deaths in tribal districts of the state. “First priority is these deaths should be stopped. Gradually, you have to bring them to the mainstream so far as healthcare is concerned. They cannot go to tantriks,” said a bench led by Chief Justice Dipankar Datta. Advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni informed about steps taken, including deputing 1,500 doctors recently recruited. He said tribals resist removal from their traditional way of living, and early marriages and births take their toll on the mother and child’s health. He also said they go to “tantrik and mantrik” and when the situation is critical, they visit the hospital. Melghat-based activist Bandu Sane said steps taken by the state are not seen on field. “From ’93 till today more than 10,000 children have died in Melghat,” he said. The bench said tribals must be got to the mainstream for healthcare. In an example of Jarawa tribe in Andaman islands, the chief justice said, “When they fall ill, they come to hospitals.” The PIL will be heard every fortnight.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/to-stop-tribal-deaths-is-top-priority-in-mumbai-hc/articleshow/86383380.cms||---

A first information report (FIR) has also been filed against the company. Board officials found a tanker discharging the liquid belonging to Ujjain-based Golden Chemical Transport Company. “A vigilant citizen gave us a tip-off,” said officials. Following this, a team of MPCB officials including sub-regional officer AN Katole and field officers AP Satfale and MN Watane carried out the site inspection. “During the inspection and enquiry, we found that the tanker, having capacity of 30 tonnes, was carrying about 25 tonne acidic effluent. It was transporting this acid from Ankleshwar in Gujarat to a company named Super Chemicals in Vaishali Nagar, Nagpur. The tanker was seen standing about 500 meters away from Vena River at Butibori and the acidic effluent was leaking from its backside, thus leading to soil contamination,” said officials. They immediately spread lime powder on the disposed acidic effluent to neutralize it and instructed the tanker operator to shift acidic effluent into leak-proof container. An FIR was filed at Butibori police station against the tanker driver and transporter. Officials added that in spite of closure directions, some industries continue to engage in the discharge of untreated effluent in water bodies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/tanker-leaks-acidic-effluent-mpcb-files-fir-against-mp-co/articleshow/86379846.cms||Manka Behl

They were also considered Covid warriors. However, they have not been paid for the past four months. As there is shortage of manpower in police stations across the city, the government had roped in Home Guards to manage the situation during the lockdown in Hubballi and Dharwad. Home Guards serve as an auxiliary force to the police in maintenance of internal security, helping the community in any kind of emergency such as an air-raid, fire, cyclone, earthquake, epidemic and maintaining law and order during festivals. There are more than 700 Home Guards and they are paid Rs 380 per day. During the second wave of Covid-19, the district administration deployed 324 Home Guards in Dharwad district. Their salary has still not cleared by the government. On condition of anonymity, a Home Guard officer told TOI that the wages have to be provided under the disaster management fund. The government has to release Rs 62 lakh to the district for the payment of pending salaries of home guards. Many Home Guards said, “We are serving society with the police department in many emergency situations, but we don't have any service security. We are getting meagre wages of Rs 380 per duty. We find it difficult to manage our families with such low wages.” Home Guards of other districts — Haveri, Gadag and Koppal — have been granted salaries for working during Covid-19 but those in Dharwad district have not been paid, they added. Deputy commissioner Nitesh Patil said, “I have written to the state government seeking release of the pending salary of Home Guards who worked during the pandemic. In response to the letter, the government has released the funds. All Home Guards, who worked during the pandemic, will be paid their salaries in the next couple of days,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/home-guards-who-worked-during-pandemic-yet-to-get-their-salaries/articleshow/86375347.cms||---

With the latest development, Sharma-Munde has completed 15 days in judicial custody for the case registered against her at Parli police station. Sharma-Munde after uploading a video message, earlier this month, had announced to reach Parli in Beed district for holding a press conference. She had claimed of knowing secrets of several political bigwigs and even had threatened to make the information public during the news conference. However, on reaching Parli, she faced stiff resistance from locals as well as NCP workers. The brawl that resulted from the scuffle ended up in registration of three offences, including one lodged by Sharma-Munde. In one of the three FIRs, she along with her alleged accomplice, Arun More, was arrested by Parli police on charges of attempt to murder and sections of Atrocities Act. After being arrested on September 5, she had moved a bail plea that was scheduled for hearing on September 14. However, on the given date, prosecution as well as the applicant failed to make submissions before the court holding additional charge, following which the matter was given next date of September 18 before the regular court. Due to long list of pending cases, the matter on Saturday was extended by another two days and was scheduled for Monday. This is the third extension to her bail plea. Lawyer Jayant Bharajkar, who is representing Sharma-Munde, said the matter was extensively heard by the court that has kept it for order on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/court-reserves-order-on-karuna-sharmas-bail/articleshow/86375367.cms||---

Mandaviya on Monday held a review meeting of six AIIMS like institutions in the country from All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. “Today, a review meeting was held and there was a discussion on construction work and research of modern infrastructure and specialist departments of many diseases. I call upon all AIIMS in the country to coordinate with each other so that we can provide the best healthcare to public,” he said in a tweet in Hindi. Last year, in July, AIIMS had started a hi-tech lab to conduct two lakh tests daily. Mandaviya visited the lab and spent some time to see the working of the lab which is fully IT and digitally enabled. Currently, this lab is conducting 3,000 to 4,000 tests per day but it has a capacity to conduct 8,000 tests per hour and two lakh tests in a single day, said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/mandaviya-urges-all-aiims-to-work-together/articleshow/86379909.cms||---
---||Hubballi||Drones to be used for sprinkling chemicals on crops||Dharwad: : The University of Agricultural Sciences is working on using drones for sprinkling insecticides and pesticides and the experiment has already commenced in the soya bean plot of the university. The UAS scientists say that the move is to ensure limited use of water, accuracy in reaching the plants and also in protecting the plants from harms likely to be caused by chemicals.Already they are using a drone on experimental basis on the soya bean fields in UAS campus here and a Drone carrying 20 liters of pesticides has sprinkled the pesticide. The project is going on under the sponsorship of Pune-based Syngenta India Limited Company which is dealing in pesticides, seeds and other far materials. Chief researcher DN Kambrekar is supervising the project.Kambrekar said the experiment has been taken up under the accurate farming’ scheme. Using the drone which has become an integral part of farming, it will be possible to identify the infected part of the field and sprinkle pesticide/ insecticide only on the affected crops. The project is still in experimental stage, he added.In a bid to compare the pros and cons of the experiment, a part of the soya bean and paddy plots have been sprinkled with pesticide using a drone while another part has been sprinkled using manpower. “We will be able to compare the effect of these two methods,” Kambrekar said.“Usually, about 200ml pesticide is mixed with 500 litres of water to be sprayed on one hectare land. But when we use a drone for sprinkling, we mixing 200ml of pesticide to 20 litres of water. The drone, which flies three metres above the field, sprays pesticide from top to bottom of the plant. Since the pesticide is of high density, the pest will be controlled within a short time. But we are also looking at how far this is safe for the overall growth of the crop,” said Kambrekar.The drone took five minutes to spray the pesticide on once acre land. In case the pesticide or the battery gets exhausted or if any technical snag develops, there is technology to ensure that the drone comes back to the operator. It is necessary to obtain training and permission to make the use of drone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/drones-to-be-used-for-sprinkling-chemicals-on-crops/articleshow/86375370.cms||GURURAJ JAMKHANDI
---||Nagpur||State directs PWD to recover 21-mth rent from sr IFS man||Nagpur: The state government has directed the public works department (PWD) to recover rent towards plum residential quarter occupied illegally by one of the senior-most IFS officers of the forest department Jeet Singh. The officer had occupied the quarter in Pune for 21 months, even after his transfer to Nagpur. Singh is presently posted at Van Bhavan, the state forest department’s headquarters as PCCF (production & management) at Nagpur. Singh did not respond to repeated calls by TOI nor did he reply to messages. TOI had in March 2021 reported how Singh violated rules by continuing to occupy the Pune quarters despite he being transferred to Nagpur on June 1, 2019, as member-secretary of Maharashtra State Biodiversity Board (MSBB). The state order, issued on September 1 by undersecretary Vijay Amolkar, also blamed PWD officials for being lax about recovering the rent which amounts to over Rs11 lakh as per market rate of Rs50,000 per month. The recovery order was issued based on a complaint filed with top authorities by Akola journalist Sheikh Azim Sheikh Qayyum in July. The government issued the order asking the PWD chief engineer, Pune, to recover rent for 21 months from Singh. This rent pertains to a period from June 1, 2019 to March 2021. “The IFS officer has not deposited the rent with the government and the executive engineer deliberately ignored the recovery. Immediate steps should be taken to recover the rent,” states the order. Even after being posted in Nagpur headquarters, Singh ran a parallel sub-office of MSBB from Pune and availed all benefits like peon allowance, telephone allowance, newspaper allowance, and TA bills which are entitled to being at headquarters. Qayyum told TOI that after his complaint, officials from the office of director-general of ACB had called him. “I presented the facts against Singh and also told the ACB officials that I would take up the matter to the home minister if no action is taken. The recovery is based on my complaint. I will also explore approaching CMO,” he said. Even as 20 days have passed since the government issued the recovery order, SS Salunkhe, chief engineer, PWD Pune, was groping in the dark about the action. “I have come to know about it from you only. Now that I have received the recovery order, I will seek details and initiate action,” he told TOI. Earlier, an executive engineer, who tried to recover the rent from Singh, was pressured not to do so by senior officials, said a PWD official from Pune.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/state-directs-pwd-to-recover-21-mth-rent-from-sr-ifs-man/articleshow/86379936.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

However, health officials are on the alert as the district continues to see intermittent rains, which is often favourable for breeding of mosquitoes.All the cases have been reported under the Madurai Corporation limits. Health officials asserted that no dengue case has been reported in rural areas so far in September. “All dengue cases being reported have only been sporadic. There is no particular locality that is reporting multiple cases of dengue. Prevention activities are immediately carried out wherever cases are reported. Domestic breeding checkers (DBCs) are making visits and are engaged in removing sources of mosquito breeding. Based on the fever surveillance, we accordingly prioritize and target areas to check mosquito breeding,” said a corporation health official. He further said that as per a schedule, outdoor fogging is being carried out across various parts of the city. A mass channel cleaning drive across Madurai city is also being organized this week as a measure to prevent breeding of mosquitoes.In August, only four dengue cases were recorded in Madurai, but there is a marginal increase now. In 2020, a total of 279 dengue cases were reported between January and December whereas this year, more than 260 cases had already been reported till mid-July. Usually, it is only by September, dengue cases start to increase with the onset of monsoon rains. “Public should not let their guard down and cooperate with DBCs in helping keep residences and offices free from mosquitoes and possible sources of mosquito breeding. Especially in case of children, as they are more vulnerable, with schools also reopened partially, cleanliness must be ensured at the campuses as well. Water storage tanks must be kept clean and covered and any stagnant water sources must be removed,” said a health official.More than 1000 DBCs across Madurai district are engaged in day-to-day dengue preventive activities, including door-to-door surveillance, removing sources of mosquito-breeding in residential areas, spraying of abate solution and bleach etc. Those with symptoms of dengue, which include high fever, headache, rashes, muscle and joint pain etc., must immediately consult a doctor. In some cases, a more severe form of dengue called dengue haemorrhagic fever, wherein severe bleeding happens due to damage of blood vessels can be life-threatening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/nine-dengue-cases-in-20-days-in-madurai/articleshow/86382096.cms||---

The cattle owners - R Udhaya Kumar, R Sahaya Raj, and R Selva Raj from K Pudur - submitted a petition to the Mattuthavani police on Monday seeking action against the watchman for injuring their cattle.They said that Mari inflicted cuts on around 30 cattle, including calves with sharp weapons like a billhook over the course of the past few weeks, whenever they crossed the area. The cattle owners had also reached out to an animal rights activist, Mayur Hassija late on Sunday night regarding the issue. However, they attacked the watchman before going to the police for help. “I went with the police to look at the cattle and also informed the regional joint director for animal husbandry and the veterinary polyclinic, Tallakulam. They’re ready to offer immediate treatment and issue health certificate whenever the police request for it,” said the activist.Police said that as of now, both the watchman and cattle owners are yet to file any written complaint and that action can be taken based on that. The cattle owners may be charged with attempt to murder based on the extent of injuries suffered by the watchman, who in turn may be booked for animal cruelty.tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/watchman-beaten-up-for-injuring-cattle/articleshow/86382106.cms||---

Chief officer of Nandgaon council Vivek Dhande said the infrastructure of the council was badly damaged due to the 126mm rainfall received within a span of five hours. Hence, we are seeking funds from district planning funds for the repair work. “District collector Suraj Mandhare visited the taluka and witnessed the extensive damage that that town has faced due to the rains. On his directions we are preparing the demand for the works that include installation of railings on the two bridges in the town, construction of damaged drinking water pipeline, damaged roads, among others.” Dhande said. The council does not have any funds to carry out these massive infrastructure repair work. “Priority remains for mending of the drinking water pipeline that has been damaged extensively. This is affecting the water supply to the residents of the town. Alternate measures are being carried out at this point in time, but they are time consuming. Hence we will be carrying out the repair of the pipeline on priority,” said the officer. The council is currently facing problem with solid waste management as the road leading to the treatment plant has also been washed away. “From the same funds we are planning to construct a culvert at far off place that will help establish the connectivity between the town and the plant. This will be a longer route, but till we get the washed away bridge in place. Hence, we will have to carry out this arrangement,” Dhande said. In case of several other bridges the approach roads have also been damaged and even that have to be repaired to ensure the motorists drive through safely.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nandgaon-municipal-council-seeks-rs-1-6-crore-for-repairing-pipelines-bridges/articleshow/86375379.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Another undertrial, who had accompanied him, did not dare to jump from that height and was caught. The escaped prisoner has been identified as Sanjay Yadav. He was lodged at Taloja jail since 2018. The other inmate was identified as Sanio Keni, also in prison since 2020 on murder charges. On Saturday, around 12.45 pm, Constable Rupali Raut noticed Keni had climbed the watch tower and was standing on the 25-foot compound wall. Raut alerted fellow Constable Narsu Koli, who climbed the watch tower and caught Keni. The unsuccessful prisoner told the jail staff that Yadav had managed to jump but he could not bring himself to follow suit for fear of injuring his legs or worse. “It is surprising that Yadav was not injured even after jumping from that height,” said an officer, adding that they had sent a team to his house in Bhandup, but did not find him.  The Taloja jail superintendent has ordered a manhunt for Yadav, while the Kharghar police registered an FIR against Yadav and Keni under various sections of the IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-undertrial-escapes-jail-by-jumping-off-25-ft-wall/articleshow/86382229.cms||George Mendonca
---||Aurangabad||With good rains, Marathwada dams hold enough stock till next monsoon||Aurangabad: Aurangabad as well as drought-prone Latur, Osmanabad and Beed districts in Marathwada will not face any drinking water scarcity till the next monsoon as different reservoirs in the region have attained their desired storage levels, authorities from the Godavari Marathwada Irrigation Development Corporation (GMIDC) have said. While the Jayakwadi major irrigation project crossed the two-thirds storage mark on Monday afternoon, most other key water projects from the region have already been overflowing due to the monsoon’s good run. Dams in Marathwada had a collective live storage of 159 TMC by Monday evening as against the designed capacity of 260 TMC, official data shows. GMIDC executive director Kiran Kulkarni said Marathwada’s dams hold sufficient storage that can cater to the region’s drinking water needs till the next monsoon. “The surplus rainfall across Marathwada this year has satisfactorily improved the storage levels in the dams. Besides catering to drinking water needs, there will hardly be any issue in fulfilling the water requirements of the agricultural sector and industries,” he said. Located around 55km from Aurangabad at Paithan, the Jayakwadi dam also supplies water to neighbouring Jalna and some other areas of the region. Latur, which had received water through a special train in 2016, depends on the Manjara dam from Beed district for its water needs. The dam has over 97% live storage, which is more than twice the quantity at the same time last year, the data shows.

The minister said while the solution, which the government will start preparing from this Friday and offer to Delhi farmers for free, was sprayed last year over around 2,000 acres, the area is estimated to have almost doubled this year, with more farmers applying for it. A 25-member committee will reach out to more farmers, officials said. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal will initiate the process for the solution preparation. Like last year, it will be made at a horticulture department nursery in southwest Delhi’s Kharkhari Nahar. “Last year, we began preparing it on October 5 and several farmers told us that the preparation should’ve started a while earlier so that they can sow the next crop on time. This year, we will double the quantity of the solution by September 29 and by October 5, it should be ready to be sprayed,” said Rai. While only non-basmati paddy crop cut by harvesters was sprayed last year, any farmland where a harvester will be used will be covered this year to ensure that there is no stubble leftover in the fields, said the minister. Delhi government said last week that it would approach the Centre to offer the bio-decomposer to the neighbouring states as a solution against stubble burning. However, Rai said the Union environment minister had still not allotted any time to meet him or the chief minister. “So I would like to request him to take cognisance of the matter,” he urged. Rai added, “This is a very grave issue and if the Centre does not act on it, it will be very late in implementing the solution. A meeting needs to be called immediately to ensure the system is adopted in time and the mechanisms are finalised. They need to understand this to be an emergency.” A third-party audit carried out by a central agency had found the bio-decomposer’s performance to be effective, the minister pointed out. “We presented a holistic report on its performance to Commission for Air Quality Management. They asked us to get a third-party audit done and a central agency also heaped praises in its report,” Rai said. The report not only called the bio-decomposer an effective solution to curb stubble burning pollution, but also said it enhanced the quality of the soil, Rai added. “We have submitted the report to Commission for Air Quality Management,” he said. According to the government, a majority of the paddy farming takes place in northwest and south-southwest Delhi and special attention needs to be given to these areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/stubble-bio-decomposer-will-be-prepared-early-cover-more-areas/articleshow/86379941.cms||---

The move comes close to the heels of Allahabad High Court pulling up the state police over delay in investigation into the death of a class 11 girl student in Mainpuri that prompted the state police chief to order a fresh SIT probe into the case. Talking to TOI, Goel said the progress of cases being probed by SITs will be reviewed every month. The SITs, which have completed the task assigned to them, will have to be screened to see if the requirement for which it was formed has been achieved. He said that each police zone has been asked to submit a list to the ADG crime of cases in which SITs have been formed. “No senior police official was monitoring the SIT that was formed to probe the death of the Mainpuri girl. From now onwards all SITs will be monitored from the DGP headquarters under the ADG crime,” said Goel. UP had formed SIT to probe a case related to alleged torture of a retired armyman Resham Singh by the UP police earlier this month. The case will now be monitored by ADG, crime. Similarly, a two-member SIT formed last month after a rape survivor and her male companion attempted self-immolation outside SC and later died will also be reviewed. The DG office will monitor a probe by SIT that was formed in Barabanki to probe how mafia don-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari used an ambulance while he was lodged in Ropar jail in April this year. SIT formed to inquire into the murder of a stone crusher dealer had found evidences of IPS Mani Lal Patidar indulging in corruption, but he has not been arrested so far. This case will also come under review of the DGP office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/monthly-review-of-sits-formed-to-probe-spl-cases/articleshow/86382137.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The turnout was high as compared to the normal days when the online booking for the first dose for every category of beneficiaries is mandatory. On such normal days, an average of 3,200 beneficiaries turn up. During the Ganesh festival, the turnout was less. The turnout is expected to reach record figures as the festival has ended and the online registration for slot booking has been done away with. Amol Mane, the vaccination nodal officer of KMC, said, “The online registration has been stopped for a while. Till then, the beneficiaries can arrive in the centre with valid identity proof and register the spot for vaccination. The turnout on Monday was more than normal days, however. still less than what we expected. We expected a turnout of at least 500 beneficiaries at most of the centres. However, in only a couple of centres, the turnout had crossed 400. We have kept on-the-spot registration facility available till September 24 and if we get adequate doses and response from beneficiaries, we will extend it further.” At some centres, the shortage of syringes affected the turnout figures. Mane said the supply of syringes is expected to normalise in a day or two. Usually, 0.5 ml syringes are used for Covid vaccination. But due to the shortage, the regular syringe is used, which is painful and causes wastage of vaccines. “We have -3% vaccine wastage, which means we have vaccinated more people in comparison to the beneficiaries expected to be vaccinated with available doses. This has been achieved due to proper training to the staff and maximum use of 0.5 ml syringes,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-3799-vax-beneficiaries-come-for-spot-registration/articleshow/86375413.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Mahant Narendra Giri, Akhara Parishad chief, found dead in Prayagraj||PRAYAGRAJ/HARIDWAR: Mahant Narendra Giri, the president of Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad (ABAP), was found dead at Shri Matt Baghambari Gaddi in Prayagraj on Monday evening. He was 62. His body was found hanging from the ceiling inside a room. Police claimed to have recovered a suicide note from his room. They also claimed that Mahant Giri has accused one of his disciples Anand Giri of ‘mental torture’ which forced him to take the extreme step. Giri was the chief of ABAP which is the apex decision-making body of the 13 recognised Hindu monastic orders of the country. Reports said some of Giri’s disciples alerted police about the incident around 5 pm on Monday. Senior police officials rushed to the spot thereafter. Taking a serious note of the incident, chief minister Yogi Aditynanath has sought a detailed report of the incident from the state home and police top brass. Talking to TOI in Lucknow, ADG (law and order) Prashant Kumar said followers of Mahant Narendra Giri had brought his body down from the noose after breaking the doors before the police reached the site. Confirming that a handwritten suicide note has been recovered from scene, the ADG said: “He has accused one of his disciple, Anand Giri of mental harassment. We have traced Anand Giri to Hardiwar and a police team has been dispatched to arrest him.” He said the scene of the incident and the suicide was being forensically examined. Sources said the suicide note runs into four sheets of paper o (written on either sides). In the suicide note Mahant Narendra Giri has stated that he had lived life ‘respectfully and wanted to die respectfully’ as well. The suicide note talks of his disciple Anand Giri having caused mental harassment to him. Informed sources said a major part of the suicide note is more of a ‘Will’ containing details like which disciple of his should get what. In Hardiwar, Mahant’s disciple Anand Giri described the incident as a murder seeking a probe into the incident. Talking to reporters at his Ghaziwala village ashram minutes before he was taken into custody by the cops from Shyampur police station in Haridwar, Anand Giri said his name in the suicide note was a part of a conspiracy. “It should be probed how Mahant Narendra Giri, who usually never wrote more than a few lines at a time, wrote such a long note,” he said. Notably, Narendra Giri was involved in a bitter property dispute with his junior Anand Giri a few months ago. The matter was later resolved supposedly in the presence of a senior police officer and two politicians. Mahant Narendra Giri’s untimely death sent shock waves among his followers and fellow seers in Sangam city, Haridwar and beyond. A large number of his followers and devotees gathered outside the Baghambari Gaddi, where Mahant Narendra Giri lived during his stay in Prayagraj. The police had cordoned the streets leading to the gaddi and deployed forces from many police stations outside the Baghambari gaddi area. No one was allowed to enter the math premises except police and administrative officials. Inspector General of Police, Prayagraj Range, KP Singh said the Panch of Akharas Parishad have been informed. The body of Mahant Narendra Giri will be sent for post-mortem examination after the Panch gather in Prayagraj on Tuesday. Thereafter the Panch will take a call on the last rites.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/akhara-parishad-chief-found-dead-cops-claim-its-suicide/articleshow/86382210.cms||Kapil Dixit

Earlier, after the first merit list was announced, 4,300 students confirmed their admissions. Even if all the students who had applied for the second round secure admissions, over 6,000 seats will still remain vacant. Subhash Chougule, secretary of CAP panel, said, “Demand for city-based colleges has reduced. Students from rural areas have preferred nearby colleges. This is due to Covid. We had given a chance to students to apply for round-2 even if they have not secured admissions. Still, few applied and all of them have got seats.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/only-836-kolhapur-students-apply-for-admission-in-2nd-round-of-cap/articleshow/86375432.cms||---
---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra University to commercialise patented innovations||VISAKHAPATNAM: Andhra University is looking for ways to commercialise its 23 patented/patent-pending technologies, ranging from healthcare and marine engineering to digital technologies and ICT, to develop them into commercially relevant products and applications. According to the university officials, these technologies have been developed within the recent years by the university faculty and researchers, which could pave a way for industry linkages. For example, one of the technologies is related to inhibition of cancer cell lines. Another technology employed waste eggshells for adsorption of phenol present in the waste water, and consequently biodegradation of adsorbed phenol was achieved by employing activated sludge. A technology developed by university Vice-Chancellor Prof PVGD Prasad Reddy works based on content based image retrieval system with edge-based structural feature extraction. It can automatically retrieve the query image from the large multimedia database by identifying image indexing. The department for promotion of industry and internal trade of the union ministry of commerce and industry recently sanctioned an Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Chair to Andhra University. DPIIT-IPR Chair, Andhra University, Prof Hanumanthu Purushotham, said that the interested MSMEs, start-ups or other organisations can reach out to the Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Chair of the university to scale up these technologies. “Commercialising these technologies into practically relevant applications/products will come with various advantages to the university, including the license fee and royalty. The interested organisations can also take advantage of the incubation centre of the varsity that is offering various services such as business advisory, market access, physical infrastructure, and mentoring,” said Prof Purushotham. Prof Purushotham added that the term of the patent is granted for 20 years. “The university wants to strengthen the innovation culture to improve research output in the institute,” said Prof Purushotham. Meanwhile, Andhra University’s Technology Start-Up Incubation Centre is currently incubating several growth stage and early stage start-ups. The university constructed a separate building for the incubation centre on the campus. While the already constructed two floors have got a 10,000 sft incubation space, two more floors are being built for the Centre, making it a total of 20,000 sft incubation space.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/au-to-commercialise-patented-innovations/articleshow/86377905.cms||Umamaheswara Rao
---||Delhi||Delhi plans single-window nod for film shooting||NEW DELHI: Delhi government is developing a single-window system under its new film policy to give necessary permissions in a fast and smooth manner to attract national and international producers and boost the entertainment industry. The absence of such a system has made it challenging for filmmakers to obtain permissions for shooting in the capital, said a source. The drafting of the film policy is at an advanced stage and is likely to be presented before the cabinet soon for approval. TimesViewThis is a welcome move. It will cut down on bureaucratic hassles and save time. The decision is long overdue. Over the past decade or so, Delhi has become a much sought-after destination for film shooting.An official said the single-window system would be developed for faster clearances and making the entire process smooth. “A software will be developed, which can be used by film producers and others concerned to seek permissions without the trouble of approaching various agencies,” the official said. Multiple permissions are now required for shooting a movie at any location in the capital and 16 agencies, such as Delhi and traffic police, Archaeological Survey of India, New Delhi Municipal Council and the three municipal corporations, are involved in this process for various sites. At least two-three permissions are required before a shooting can be undertaken. “If a film is being shot under the jurisdiction of North Delhi Municipal Corporation, the producer needs to obtain separate permissions from the corporation, Delhi Police and traffic police,” said a producer. A couple of producers TOI spoke to said they were happy with the government’s decision to bring a new policy. “The shooting of films in Delhi is costly. Around Rs 75,000 to Rs 2 lakh is to be paid as fees for shooting at one site. It is costlier than many foreign destinations, which is discouraging small-budget producers,” said a producer. Recently, chief secretary Vijay Dev held a meeting to discuss the policy with officials of various agencies. An official said the policy would also aim to promote lesser known tourist destinations such as Sanjay Van and Naini Lake through films. The government has studied the film policy of other states, he added. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal recently said Delhi government would come out with a film policy that would be the most progressive. The policy will soon get the approval of the cabinet, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-plans-single-window-nod-for-film-shooting/articleshow/86380346.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Agra||Uttar Pradesh: Quack continues to flourish in Firozabad, death toll reaches to 145||AGRA: Despite recent orders of chief minister Yogi Adityanath to take strict action against local quacks in Firozabad after the dengue outbreak, the 'illegal clinics' continue to operate freely in rural parts of the district. With no vacant beds at state hospitals, people are desperately looking for other options to treat their loved ones. Five more deaths were reported in the last 24 hours, taking the toll in Firozabad alone to 145. Out of these, 108 were children. Those with viral fever and dengue-like symptoms are treated on cots placed under trees and at homes. A video of Usyani village under Tundla sub-division of Firozabad district went viral on social media on Monday. In the purported clip, two individuals can be seen lying on a cot under a tree and given intravenous fluids. Local villager and farmer, Ranveer Singh, claimed, "In over 400 villages, a majority of the children are suffering from viral fever. Government hospitals are not admitting patients as all the beds are full. So, locals largely depend on quacks for treatment. We have no other option.” In one of the findings of their investigation behind the increasing number of fatalities, the health department teams sent by the state government to Firozabad had stated that "initial treatment by quacks operating in slums and rural areas was a major reason". "Patients were administered steroids. This provided initial relief, but multiplied the rate of falling platelets. Blood vomiting was common in such cases," it further stated. Taking cognizance of the quack menace, the CM had ordered strict action. A day after the CM’s orders, eight quacks were booked under the Firozabad south police station on September 11. Their 'clinics' were sealed. Additional director of the health department, AK Singh, said, “Quacks have been a huge issue in Firozabad. The initial treatment provided by them is resulting in patients coming to the government hospital in critical condition. Local authorities have been directed to ensure strict action against them. People are advised not to rely on unauthorised doctors and must consult with a government doctor. The number of beds at state hospitals are also being increased." There are 64 active camps in the district and 5,000 people, including those with viral fever, are undergoing treatment there, CMO Dinesh Kumar Premi said. Sources also recently told TOI that at least 12,000 people in the district are estimated to be bedridden with fever at home or in private hospitals. So far, more than 800 cases of dengue have been confirmed in Firozabad district. A few cases of malaria and scrub typhus have also been reported.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/quack-menace-continues-in-firozabad-patients-in-rural-areas-treated-under-trees/articleshow/86377948.cms||Deepak Lavania

According to police, the suspect was caught on closed-circuit television camera, but identifying and arresting him became a task due to his attire. The accused has been identified as Naeem alias Chunnu Shah of Saeeda Colony on Jatwada Road. Shah already has around five property offences registered against him in different police stations across the city. “The accused was nabbed on Sunday by a team led by police sub-inspector Datta Shelke. The team managed to recover some of the stolen articles from the accused following which he was grilled only to find his involvement in three house break-in and thefts,” a police officer said. As per press release issued by the police department, the accused has confessed to committing burglaries in two houses in N1-Cidco and at one house in Harsul area. Police said the first two offences were reportedly committed around a year ago in the limits of MIDC Cidco, while the third one was committed about a couple of weeks ago in the limits of Harsul police station. Shete said that the accused managed to evade getting identified as he would change his appearance while committing the crime. The accused would first survey the house and area before changing his appearance and return to commit the theft. The accused has been handed over to the area police station and police are checking his involvement in other undetected cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/man-held-for-burglaries-while-dressed-as-woman/articleshow/86375438.cms||---

And, most of them require skin cove for treatment. In this backdrop, the medical fraternity has once again pitched for the setting up of a skin bank in Vizag city. Most of the burn patients in the region are from middle-class and lower-middle-class sections of the society. Usually, it’s the dressing material which dictates the treatment cost. Due to this, the medical fraternity feels that the use of allograft skin can be economical for the patients and can save their life. In a rare instance, a 32-year-old-woman from Vizag who suffered severe burn injuries (over 65 per cent) in a lightning strike recovered after being treated in Seven Hills hospital for over 60 days. She had lost her five-year-old son to the lightning strike. Though cases of burns have been reporting for many years, state doesn’t have a skin bank. We have been depending on the skin bank in Maharashtra and a few other places to treat the patients in Vizag. The largest organ of the body is the skin and even the loss of over 40 per cent of the skin in burn incidents can be fatal if the tissue is not placed, said Dr Anjali Saple, a noted plastic surgeon at Seven Hills hospital, who has saved a good number of burn patients in the region. “There is an urgent need to set up a skin bank in Andhra Pradesh and to create awareness among the people about the cadaver skin donations to save the burn patients. Skin can help burn patients greatly as it is used as a biological dressing,” she added. Due to industrial accidents, fire mishaps, and others, there are a good number of people who suffer burn injuries. But we are unable to help many of them in the absence of a skin bank. We are ready to start a skin bank at the state-run King George Hospital in Vizag city if the government allocates land, funds and manpower,” said Dr PV Sudhakar, principal, Andhra Medical College (AMC), Vizag.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/burn-cases-call-for-skin-bank-in-vizag/articleshow/86377952.cms||Nalla.Babu

The move was in return of a fine imposed on a Discom employee who had gone to file a complaint of a transformer theft but was fined for not wearing a helmet by a policeman. The incident led to an embarrassment among police officers, who swung into action, had a conversation with Discom officials and managed to get the power supply restored in around 3 hours. “A Discom official had a tiff with a policeman, who instead of filing the complaint, fined him for not wearing a helmet. He reported this matter to his seniors. Enraged by this act of police, the officials immediately sent a vigilance team to the police station”, said a source. This team began inspection of entire police station premises and quarters in it with a videography and found seven quarters engaged in electricity theft and also that electricity bill was due since long. On this observation, the team reported the matter to the seniors, who ordered to disconnect the power connection of police station and the seven quarters. As soon as this information reached senior police officers, they swung into action and and managed to restore supply. None of the officials, however, agreed to comment on the matter. A call to an assistant engineer in Pipar city remained unanswered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jodhpur/power-staff-fined-supply-to-thana-cut/articleshow/86379980.cms||---

---||India||Channi takes oath, Punjab Dy CMs picked amid drama||CHANDIGARH: Three-time Congress MLA Charanjit Singh Channi was sworn in as the first Dalit Sikh CM of Punjab on Monday, along with two deputies — Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and O P Soni. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and AICC in charge of Punjab Harish Rawat, besides PCC president Navjot Singh Sidhu, attended the ceremony. While the party leadership has tried to strike a caste balance by picking Randhawa (a Jat Sikh) and Soni (a Hindu), along with the party’s dalit face for the top post, the selection of the deputy CMs was not without drama — which was seen in choosing Channi the previous day as well. Party insiders said Rawat had spoken to Brahm Mohindra, a six-term MLA, on Sunday night for the deputy CM’s post and the latter had even got congratulatory calls from senior party leaders. AICC national treasurer Pawan Bansal had also tweeted to congratulate Mohindra and Randhawa as deputy CMs. But things changed by Monday morning, with the perception of being from former CM Amarinder Singh’s camp working against Mohindra. Finally, the leadership settled for Soni, a five-term MLA. In his first remarks after the swearing in, Channi, who took the oath of office and secrecy in Punjabi, appealed to the Centre to scrap the three contentious farm laws. He also spelt out the agenda of his government, saying relief will be provided to the economically weak by slashing power and water bills and the sand mafia will be wiped out from the state. Channi also promised to resolve the pending issues of state employees. Flanked by Sidhu and Rawat at his first press conference as CM, Channi said: “Punjab is an agricultural economy and if there is a threat to the farming sector, we will make any sacrifice. I make an appeal to the Centre to take back the three farm laws. The economy of the state is dependent on the farming sector. We support the farmers’ agitation.” Announcing a slew of relief measures, he said that power for the agriculture sector should continue to be free. “However, water supply for the rural sector should also not be billed. There are pending bills ranging from 10 to 30 lakh and the cabinet will waive them... In urban areas, bills of water supply and sewerage will not be charged for houses of up to 150 or 200 square yards. The 18-point agenda of AICC will be implemented one by one without delay.” Recalling his humble origins, he said he stood for the common man. “I am a representative of rickshaw-pullers, I myself pulled a rickshaw. My father had a tent house and I carried chairs house to house.” He recalled the struggle of his parents in a house without a proper roof or floor. “The Congress high command has picked a common man who had nothing. Rahul Gandhi is a revolutionary leader, someone who stands for the downtrodden,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/channi-takes-oath-punjab-dy-cms-picked-amid-drama/articleshow/86384841.cms||Vibhor Mohan

Rai Singh Gurjar had allegedly sustained critical head injuries in a road mishap on Saturday night and died during treatment. Following a report, police lodged a murder case under IPC sections against a few persons and began investigation. Police, however, have ruled out the possibility of murder. Gurjar had in September 2019 voiced concern against corruption through RTIs in development work being carried out in Titarwasa gram panchayat, which was adopted by vice president Venkaiah Naidu under the model village scheme when he was Rajya Sabha member in May 2017. Gurjar had allegedly sustained critical head injuries after his motorbike was hit by an auto-rickshaw in Madhopura village. He was rushed to Jhalawar district hospital, where he succumbed to injuries during treatment later in the night. There were no injury marks on his body barring a deep wound in his head, said Sujan Singh Gurjar, brother of the deceased. He added that the deep wound apparently appeared to have been created with some sharp weapon. On Sunday, Sujan lodged a police complaint against Chandra Singh, a gram sevak, sarpanch Kalulal Bheel, Dinesh Patidar, who was involved in illegal transportation of soil, and Naipal Singh, a resident of Titarwas village.

At the opening ceremony on Monday, Lt Gen SS Mahal, GOC Uttar Bharat Area “addressed the gathering and exhorted the contingents to train and strengthen mutual confidence, inter-operability and also to share best practices,” the Army statement said. “The understandings developed between the two armies at the top level recently are an encouraging sign for both the nations and their armies for further cooperation,” Lt Gen Mahal said.  The Indian side in the joint exercise is being represented by the 6th Garhwal Regiment, while the Nepalese side is being represented by Ripu Daman battalion of Nepali Army. Around 650 personnel from both sides are participating in the training to develop interoperability and share their experiences in counter- terrorism and relief operation, Lt Gen Mahal said.

---||Kolhapur||Cops deny Somaiya entry into Kolhapur, war of words erupts||Kolhapur: Former BJP MP Kirit Somaiya on Monday said attempts were made by the Mumbai police to stop him from going to Kolhapur while the Kolhapur police later made him get down from the Mahalaxmi Express at Karad. The action against Somaiya turned into a political war of words, with the Shiv Sena saying that the chief minister’s office (CMO) was unaware of any prohibitory orders against the BJP leader and that it was a measure taken by the NCP-led home department. Somaiya said that at Karad, the Kolhapur police handed him the district collector’s order prohibiting him from entering Kolhapur, stating that it could lead to a law-and-order problem. Somaiya had planned to visit Santaji Ghorpade Cooperative Sugar Factory, which he alleged is a “benami property” of minister for rural development Hasan Mushrif. Mushrif has denied the allegations and said he would be filing a Rs 50 crore defamation suit against Somaiya. Speaking to the media at Karad, Somaiya said, “The Mumbai police showed me a forged order of the Kolhapur district collector asking me not to leave my house and not to leave Mumbai. The Mumbai police behaved roughly with me at the railway station. After arriving at Karad, I was told by the Kolhapur police that I am prohibited from entering the city as NCP workers had threatened to harm me. I will approach the Bombay high court against Mumbai police commissioner Hemant Nagrale for forging the order and illegally detaining me for six hours.” Somaiya further alleged, “Mushrif, after becoming minister, parked his money into a company belonging to his son-in-law, who in 2020 had invested in the Gadhinglaj sugar factory. In the case of the Santaji Ghorpade Sugar Factory, I have submitted 3,700 page complaint to the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Central Bureau of Direct Taxes. Both have initiated inquiries.” Refuting the allegations, Mushrif said in Kolhapur, “Neither me nor my son-in-law own any such company. Somaiya is not a court. For the fresh allegations, I will slap Rs 50 crore defamation against Somaiya.” Kolhapur collector Rahul Rekhawar has imposed a curfew in Kolhapur district for Monday and Tuesday. Mushrif’s supporters cancelled their protest organised to back their leader. Somaiya said he will again seek permission to travel to Kolhapur. Reacting to the issue, state BJP president Chandrakant Patil on Monday said legal battles should be fought in the courts and not in the streets. Speaking at a press conference in Pune, Patil said “instigating” workers to attack BJP leaders was wrong and that the MVA leaders should face the ED. Patil said Somaiya has gone to different cities and made allegations against various leaders but was not barred from entering any place before. “Only on Monday was he stopped from entering Kolhapur. The language of beating up the BJP leader with footwear if he tries to reach Kolhapur was unbecoming,” he said. Patil said Mushrif should explain how companies from Kolkata invested in a sugar mill in Kolhapur. “Mushrif should clarify on doubts regarding the involvement of his family members, including his son-in-law,” Patil said. Responding to the allegations that Mushrif was being targeted because he rejected an offer to join the BJP, Patil said he was never offered membership of the party. “He is making such statements to divert attention,” he said. Patil said the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) has dismantled various systems of the state government, including the police and revenue department. “They have been corrupted for the MVA’s political interests. The internal rift between the leaders of the three parties is also causing problems in coordination among the government,” he said. Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said in Mumbai that the CMO had nothing to do with the home department's action against the former BJP MP. “I spoke to CM Uddhav Thackeray and he said the CMO has nothing to do with it,” Raut told reporters and asserted that there was no politics of vendetta. Raut said the home department's action of preventing Somaiya from entering Kolhapur was taken to maintain law and order. He also alleged that the BJP was trying to destabilise the MVA government in Maharashtra and “malign the state on the Centre's directives.” (With inputs from PTI)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/cops-deny-somaiya-entry-into-kolhapur-war-of-words-erupts/articleshow/86375458.cms||---

I have been performing my duty with full dedication, whether as a member of the national commission, as mayor or as governor. I will continue to do so,” Maurya told TOI after the announcement. “I am happy the party has given me such an important position.” With no political lineage, Maurya, 65, worked her way up the party ranks over decades. She was the first Dalit woman to become Agra’s mayor in 1995 as a BJP candidate. After holding the post for five years, she served on the National Commission for Women from 2002 to 2005 before being appointed the governor of Uttarakhand in 2018. Within the party, she had been appointed an office-bearer for the SC wing which Ram Nath Kovind was heading at the time — in 1997. She had also contested the 2007 UP assembly election from Etmadpur as a BJP candidate but lost by a narrow margin to BSP’s Narayan Singh. She is likely to be the party’s Dalit face for the UP assembly election next year. With the two appointments on Monday, BJP now has 13 national vice-presidents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/2-wks-after-quitting-as-guv-baby-rani-maurya-appointed-bjp-natl-vice-prez/articleshow/86377979.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Lucknow||PMLA case: ED quizzes Azam Khan in Sitapur jail||LUCKNOW: After getting a go ahead from the designated court, a three-member team of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Monday began questioning Rampur MP Azam Khan who is currently lodged in Sitapur jail. ED officials privy to the probe said the questioning would continue till September 24. Azam and his son Abdullah Azam Khan have been languishing in jail since February 2020. Abdullah is accused of furnishing the wrong date of birth while filing nomination papers for the assembly elections in 2017. Sitapur jail authorities said two officials of the Enforcement Directorate reached the prison around 1.30pm and were joined by another official at 3pm. Sitapur jail authorities said two officials of Enforcement Directorate reached the prison around 1.30pm and were joined by another official at 3pm. A senior ED official said Azam and his son Abdullah were booked under PMLA in August 2019 on the basis of the cases registered against them in Rampur. “Huge donations were received and wealth was amassed by the Jauhar Trust, headed by Azam Khan,” the officer said. ED is also tracking and scanning the details of the trustees who gave money for establishment of the Mohammad Ali Jauhar University in Rampur. A source in the ED said investigations revealed that hawala money was used by the trust for the establishment of the university and illegal occupation of land also came to light. Sources said several people donated money to the trust and, in return, received contracts for construction works and supply of goods and material. In July, ED had also sought details of the status of the cases against Azam Khan from Rampur police which informed the agency that 81 cases were registered in which Azam’s son Abdullah and wife Tanzeen Fatima were co-accused. Police said chargesheet had been filed in 79 cases and closure report was submitted in one case. Most of these cases relate to land grabbing and cheating. Final report was filed in two other cases. On September 9, the state government had taken 70 hectare land of Jauhar University in its possession. The district administration had got the land evicted from the trust after the Allahabad high court dismissed a petition against the proceedings initiated by the state government to take over the university’s land for nonadherence to certain conditions on which land was granted to the trust in 2005.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/pmla-case-ed-quizzes-azam-in-sitapur-jail/articleshow/86382279.cms||---

At 18,510 feet, Mount Elbrus is one among the seven summits which presents a strenuous trek that exposes the mountaineers to treacherous weather and extreme physical strain. The boy who was trained by Sankaraiah, the sports coach of rural development trust (RDT) at Anantapuram, scaled Mt Elbrus along with his team on September 18. Bhuvan Jai proudly displayed the Indian tricolour after summiting the peak. Apart from Bhuvan Jai, the expedition team comprised Shankaraiah, Naveen Mallesh, Anminsh Bhupathi Raju. Bhuvan Jai thanked his father Gandham Chandrudu, IAS, who served as Anantapur district collector, for his encouragement.

---||Dehradun||5 MBBS students expelled from hostel over protest against fees||Dehradun: A top government medical college in Dehradun has taken disciplinary action against five second-year MBBS students, expelling them from the hostel of the institution for protesting against “exorbitant tuition fee” of Rs 4.2 lakh per year. The students at The Government Doon Medical College alleged they were thrown out without any notice period to arrange for accommodation even though three of them belonged to states outside Uttarakhand. Principal of the medical college, Dr Ashutosh Sayana, confirmed the suspension to TOI. “The students have been asked to leave the hostel for not listening to the warden, disrespecting security and for instigating their juniors to participate in the agitation as found by the disciplinary committee of the college,” he said. Sayana added that the college authorities did not decide the fee structure as it was a government college and tuition is decided by the state government. One of the students under suspension from the hostel told TOI that they have been protesting from 5 to 7pm after attending classes for the last month. “We did not disturb classes. It was a peaceful protest attended by many students. Why are only five students being targeted?” the student said. Other students TOI spoke to said a candle march is being planned in support of suspended pupils. “Other Himalayan states have fees ranging from only Rs 8,000 per year, like Assam, to maximum Rs 75,000 per year charged by government colleges in Tripura. Then why is Uttarakhand charging so much? All of us cleared the same NEET exam to get admission into colleges, so why such disparity in fees?” said a student. Notably, medical students from the college had led another agitation a few months ago which had resulted in their monthly stipends being more than doubled — from Rs 7,000 to Rs 17,000 — by the high court in July.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/5-mbbs-students-expelled-from-hostel-over-protest-against-fees/articleshow/86375470.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Nashik||Devotees utilize options made available for safer Ganesh visarjan||Nashik/Kolhapur: Ganesh visarjan on Anant Chaturdashi was a relatively low-key affair in most places. In Nashik, unlike during the pre-Covid years, the natural ghats in the city did not see a significant surge of devotees immersing idols on Sunday. Even in Kolhapur, crowding was controlled along the immersion route. The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) had set up artificial immersion sites at the various places in the city and the ‘Tank on Wheels’ concept was also implemented for the first time. “The various choices presented to the citizens were utilized very well. A significant number of people immersed their idols at the locally available options, rather than at the ghats. This was beneficial during the current pandemic,” said Dr Avesh Palod, who had been coordinating the NMC’s efforts in ensuring safe celebrations this year. The NMC had made arrangements at 27 locations along the natural immersion sites — along the banks of the Godavari, Nandinee, and Waldevi rivers — and at 42 other spots where tanks had been set up. Moreover, six ‘Tanks on Wheels’ were also pressed into service for the first time to meet the demand from private housing complexes. A total of 1.12 lakh Ganesh idols were collected by the NMC through volunteers and employees at the various immersion sites. An additional 1,048 idols were collected by the ‘Tanks on Wheels’. “It was a novel concept. As we did not have to travel to immerse our idols, we could enjoy more. All the members of the family, even the elderly people, could witness the visarjan,” said Subhash Shirole of Nashik’s Parksyde Homes. “We preferred to give our idols at the collection centres instead of visiting the ghats. Our intention was to contribute to the fight against the pandemic. However, after the pandemic end, we will revert to immersion idols at the natural sites,” said Ramesh Kulkarni, a resident of Shankar Nagar. Many people also immersed idols — made of red or black soil or shadu clay — at their homes. The NMC also collected 117.85 tonne of nirmalya at its collection centres. The visarjan was a simple and eco-friendly affair in Kolhapur as well. The immersion process, which started at 9.30 am with the visarjan of the clay idol of Pratham Manacha Ganpati of the Shri Tukaram Mali Talim mandal by Kolhapur guardian minister Satej Patil, superintendent of police Shailesh Balkawade, KMC chief Kadambari Balkawade, MLA Chandrakant Jadhav and other members of the group, continued for more than 20 hours. Girls and women dressed in traditional attire played lezim and other traditional games. More than 2,500 idols from across the city were immersed in the Irani quarry. The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation made use of a conveyor-belt ramp to carry the small idols directly into the water. Fire brigade and disaster management teams were on alert at the quarry. Only five members were allowed with each idol. Heavy police force had been deployed to control the crowd along the immersion route and near the quarry. The administration had also prepared another quarry next to the Rankala lake. The state government had set a 2-feet height limit for household idols, while pandals had been allowed to have idols of 4 feet height. However, when the 21-feet idol was brought for immersion by the Chhatrapati Shivaji Chowk Tarun mandal, heated arguments took place between the police personnel and mandal members. The Laxmipuri police station registered an offence against 100 group members, including pandal head Nandkumar Valanju, the former mayor of Kolhapur. The same pandal was also charged for taking out a procession at the time of Ganapati’s arrival. An offence was then registered against 125 members along with the dhol taasha group. The Juna Rajwada police station registered an offence against the Dayawan Talim from the Sakoli corner area for gathering a crowd and playing music on a high-decibel sound system.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/devotees-utilize-options-made-available-for-safer-ganesh-visarjan/articleshow/86375473.cms||---

The video, which has gone viral, was shot two days before her death. Citing it, the woman’s family has alleged that her husband is responsible for her death. Efforts are on to trace and arrest him, police said. SSP Bulandshahr Santosh Singh said, "It is a case of dowry and we have booked the accused under relevant sections. He is on the run.” Family sources said Muskan (25) and Hasan Ahmad, 30, were married two years ago. It was a second marriage for both. Later, marital discord arose between the two as the man still kept in touch with his first wife. Zeenat Khan, sister of the deceased, claimed, "Hasan Ahmad came to our house in Khurja on Friday, as my sister was living with us. He brutally thrashed her so much so that blood splattered all over her face. I had secretly made the video. He tried to snatch my phone away but I did not give in. On Sunday, he killed her.” The couple somehow patched up and went back to their rented accommodation in Bulandshahr city on Saturday. Muscan was found murdered on Sunday night. Her husband is absconding.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/2-days-after-video-of-man-beating-wife-is-shot-she-is-found-murdered/articleshow/86378011.cms||Sandeep Rai

District collector Suraj Mandhare has taken a note of the incident. He told superintendent of police (Nashik rural) Sachin Patil to ensure stringent action is taken against the suspects involved. “I condemn the incident that took place at a vaccination centre under Pandhurli Primary Health Centre (PHC) in Sinnar taluka. Such incidents will demoralise the health workers, who are working hard to vaccinate the beneficiaries,” he said. Dr Lahu Patil, the medical officer of the PHC of Pandhurli, said about three to four locals visited the sub-PHC at Paste village on Saturday evening and demanded to be given the vaccine shot immediately. They refused to stand in a queue, like other villagers. “It was obvious that the inoculators could not allow this as it would affect the morale of the ones, who have been standing in the queue. Hence, when the inoculators refused to give them the shots, the villagers abused and roughed them up,” said Patil. As a mark of protest, the entire health staff at the 204 PHCs refrained from vaccinating on Monday. A delegation of the health workers met Nashik ZP CEO Leena Bansod, demanding the suspects to be booked under the stringent sections of IPC.“We are in touch with the rural police on the issue and action will be taken against the suspects,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/no-vaccination-at-204-zp-run-phcs-in-nashik/articleshow/86375487.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Jaipur||Delay in power evacuation nod stalls solar park development||JAIPUR: Solar park development has come to a halt in the state as the energy department has stopped giving approvals for power evacuation, without which the energy generated by them cannot be injected to the transmission grid network. The state government in its solar policy has set a target of adding 30,000 megawatt and the capacity of the proposed parks since April 2020 constitute over 7,000 MW. A senior official in the energy department said they are looking at the issue of providing the approvals. As per the Solar Policy-2019, Rajasthan Vidyut Prasaran Nigam Ltd and discoms are mandated to accord approval to the power evacuation applications within a month. But solar parks having 3,700 MW capacity are still waiting for the approval for close to three months. Subodh Agarwal, additional chief secretary, department of energy said, “Given the investors’ interest, solar parks are going to be a major driver of green energy in Rajasthan. The energy department will look into the issue for early, hassle-free approval of power evacuation proposals.” When asked if there is scope for land hoarding by the power project developers, an official in Rajasthan Renewable Energy Corporation Ltd said there is a time stipulation for starting the projects. “If these parks don’t start operation within three years, the department withdraws the power evacuation approval.” “As per Rajasthan Electricity Regulatory Commission (RERC), after getting the evacuation approval, the park developer is required to pay Rs 2.50 lakh per megawatt as grid connectivity charges. So, it seems by hoarding the approvals, the developer is unlikely to gain much.” He said there are instances where RRECL has withdrawn the approval as the park developers failed to meet the three-year criteria of starting the operations. There was another view that since the state government itself had decided to set up 1785 MW solar power for its own consumption, and the auctions are going to start in a month or so, the winning bidders should be given priority for according power evacuation approvals. “There is the issue of load capacity of the transmission lines. But right now, there is enough load capacity both for the state projects and the solar projects,” said the RRECL official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/delay-in-power-evacuation-nod-stalls-solar-park-devpt/articleshow/86380055.cms||---
---||Mumbai||ED arrests MD of Andheri firm for cheating banks, laundering Rs 916 crore||MUMBAI: The Enforcement Directorate arrested Vinod Chaturvedi, managing director of Andheri-based company Usher Agro Ltd, in a Rs 916 crore money laundering case and produced him before a court on Saturday. The court remanded Chaturvedi in five days’ ED custody. The ED alleged Chaturvedi and director Manoj Pathak, along with others, conspired to cheat banks after taking loan and had siphoned off the money through fictitious transactions. ED officials stated that Vinod Chaturvedi was a key person involved in the money laundering and he refused to provide details of the money trail during his questioning last Friday, which led to his arrest in the case. ED officials stated that during investigation, they found that the accused had formed 15 shell companies and had carried out bogus transactions through these shell companies. The accused had also allegedly sent money abroad, mainly to Dubai, through fictitious transactions. The Usher Agro group companies have also carried out bogus transactions with the scam-tainted Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DHFL) group. The ED’s money laundering case is based on the CBI’s FIR that was registered in 2019 against Usher Agro Ltd, a rice milling company, its promoters and directors for allegedly cheating Rs 916 crore from a consortium of banks, including IDBI Bank which was the complainant in the case. Usher claimed to be one of the leading rice millers in the country and has its registered office at Laxmi Industrial Estate in Andheri (West). It is alleged Usher Agro had overstated its stock position, which helped it avail increased working capital limit from banks. The company had routed the money and cheated the banks. Officials said Usher Agro had used around 15 suspicious companies, with whom it entered into fictitious purchase-sale transactions, and used them to siphon off the bank loan money between 2013 and 2016.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaied-arrests-md-of-andheri-firm-for-cheating-banks-laundering-money/articleshow/86382343.cms||Vijay V Singh

The accident took place at 5.05pm about eight kilometres before the New Ekdil railway station, between Mahola and Bichpuri Kheda villages in Vedpura police station area. The goods train with 58 wagons was heading to Bokaro steel plant with a consignment of limestones. Total 44 wagons were derailed, and one of them rolled down sideways in the field killing a 14-year-old boy who was grazing a herd of sheep, and injuring three others at the spot. The deceased minor was identified as Sachin Diwakar, and the injured as Anurag, Gaurav and a woman Suman, who were rushed to a government hospital after police and rescue team reached the spot. Police officials said one wagon rolled down 25 feet and hurtled towards the deceased teenager and three others in the fields. Movement on the freight corridor was stalled and railway sources said it might take three-four days to clear the mangled wagons and limestones. Special cranes were dispatched from Agra and Kanpur to the accident site to remove the wagons. DFC official Neeraj Verma said, “The train was heading to Bokaro steel plant from Sonu railway station of Jaisalmer. One boy got killed and three others were injured. The train crew is safe. Cranes are yet to reach the spot and it might take up to 48 hours to clear the track.” The commissioner of railway safety will probe the incident, sources added.

Senior officers confirmed more people who were involved in organising blood donation camps without following norms were likely to be arrested in this case from Rajasthan. TimesViewThe unearthing of a gang involved in smuggling human blood between Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana has brought to the fore loopholes in the system which are being manipulated by criminals to their advantage. The incident should prompt the health department and police department to take preventive action against such unscrupulous elements. Rules also need to be reframed to ensure that donated blood does not reach the wrong hands.“As of now we know that Dr Abhay Pratap Singh and his aide Abhishek Pathak had their team members in parts of Bharatpur and Alwar, especially in the Mewat region, where blood donation camps were organised by flouting norms. It was found that they had local facilitators who assisted them in organising the camp. Some donors were drug addicts hence there’s a possibility that they were lured to the camp with money,” said a senior officer of Lucknow STF. STF DSP Amit Nagar said, “Blood transfers took place from one blood bank to another. We found that the accused had fake letters of blood banks that never existed. Those who connived with them will also be arrested. We are probing as to what extent were people of Mewat were involved.” “So far we know that 100 units of blood seized by us was collected from parts of Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana. If they have local facilitators, they will also be arrested from these states,” Nagar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/blood-scam-up-police-after-gang-facilitators-in-raj/articleshow/86380066.cms||Ashish Mehta
---||Pune||Learning suffers as rural pupils wait for textbooks||Pune: Many zilla parishad teachers from across Maharashtra have complained that they have yet to receive textbooks for the academic year which started three months ago in June 2021. Teachers said while they have collected textbooks from the batch passing out of each class and given them to the new batch of students, there are many problems s such distribution and there are not enough to pass around. “The textbooks must have been made available when the schools reopened. While we did collect old textbooks, that is not enough. As far as our area is concerned, I hear the textbooks have reached till the block level, but I don’t know why they are not distributing them to schools. We enquired with teachers in other areas such as Ratnagiri and Nagpur and they also have not received textbooks as yet. While the textbooks are available online, a huge chunk of students especially in rural areas, still do not have the gadgets to access online education, do not have internet access or do not have the know-how to do so,” Nitin Khandale, a zilla parishad primary school teacher in Jalgaon, said. Ashok Chepte, a ZP teacher from Pune said students without textbooks are also finding it hard to learn the topics taught. “In textbooks, there are multiple examples given, there are several examples to solve and understand the topic. However, when we teach, the time is limited and it is not possible that the student memorises everything. Hence, textbooks are a must for students to read and understand what has been taught in the class. Even when we teach, we tell them to look at a diagram or a picture or a particular paragraph in the chapter. Without textbooks, many students are unable to do so. Even here, we hear that the textbooks have reached the block level but we do not know why they are not being distributed to schools,” added Chepte. Dinkar Patil, director of Balbharati, said, “We have delivered all the textbooks to the divisional depots almost a month ago. The process of distribution of textbooks from the divisional depots to schools is the responsibility of the directorate of primary education. Each year, we print about 9-9.5 crore textbooks. The textbooks under Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan come to around 5.45 crore which have been printed and already distributed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/learning-suffers-as-rural-pupils-wait-for-textbooks/articleshow/86380087.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Nashik||Nashik civic body to carry out sero survey||Nashik: The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has decided to carry out sero survey for Covid antibodies in locations that were Covid hotpots during the second wave of the pandemic. The sero survey will be conducted not only in areas where higher number of cases were reported, but also where the number of vaccinated beneficiaries is also high. “The plan is to identify how many people already have antibodies,” Dr Bapusaheb Nagargoje, medical superintendent of the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC), said. He added the sero survey for antibodies helped in assessment of the situation in particular area. “Based on the findings the health department can plan deployment of the infrastructure and manpower for carrying out health surveys and even the vaccination programme. Besides the treatment plan can also be decided when number of new cases starts to rise,” he said. “The lower presence of antibodies in an area will mean that vaccination has to be increased there,” another doctor from the civic body said, adding this will also help the NMC to plan for carrying out health surveys in such areas and take preventive measures accordingly. The officer said the corporation had carried out a survey after the first Covid wave and that had revealed presence of antibodies among 40 percent of the people who were in close contact with the Covid patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-civic-body-to-carry-out-sero-survey/articleshow/86375500.cms||Abhilash Botekar

---||Rajkot||Gujarat: 1,800 trees nurtured for 13 years bulldozed in Veraval||RAJKOT: Environment activists and nature lovers in the coastal Veraval town helplessly watched as nearly 1,800 trees were axed to make space for a commercial complex and auditorium, on Monday. The trees, hundreds of which were over 20 foot tall, were part of a nature park that was developed, ironically with the blessings of Veraval municipality on an unused 9,584 sq m plot of the civic body. In fact, the green drive champions had been protesting against the civic body’s decision to permit commercial building here since 2018. The activists, some of them from the Art Of Living Foundation, said of the around 1,800 trees run over by bulldozers, 850 had grown over 20 foot tall. Vijay Sagar, one of the green warriors, said, “The civic body asked us to plant trees and maintain them. We also got saplings from the forest department for two years. Around 100 tree lovers of Veraval have been maintaining this park by spending money from our pockets. But all our efforts over the last 13 years was axed in a day.” Sagar also claimed that the municipality had also issued a no-objection certificate to get water meter connections in their name so they can trees can be properly nurtured. “During Janmashtami festival, when contractors started cutting the trees, we approached the chief minister’s office (CMO) and they stopped. Thereafter, we went to meet then CM Vijay Rupani in Gandhinagar and he assured us that no more trees would be cut.” There were some tense moments when the activists hugged the trees and refused bull-dozing them. When contacted, Jatin Mehta, chief officer, Veraval municipality said, “This is a reserve plot for a commercial complex under the town planning scheme and cann’t be used for any other purpose. The land was barren some years ago, so we had allowed tree plantation. We cut around 960 trees and most of the species did not require any permission for chopping.” He added, “As per our contract condition, the contractor had to clean the site on his own. They (activists) wanted to represent higher authorities and wanted to explore legal options, so we gave them time. However, there was neither any order from the higher authorities nor a stay granted by the court to suspend our work, so we continued with it.” Mehta added. However activists argued that if this plot was reserved for a commercial complex, then why were they asked to plant and maintain trees for so many years?||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/1800-trees-nurtured-for-13-years-bulldozed-in-veraval/articleshow/86375534.cms||---
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Agency for Covid fine app to be appointed this week||PUNE: Four agencies have submitted bids to the state government to design and operate a smartphone application to issue e-challans for violation of Covid-19 norms. Aseem Gupta, relief and rehabilitation principal secretary, said the proposals were being studied and that the agency would be finalized at a review meeting later this week. The agency appointed will receive a nominal commission to operate and maintain the application, Gupta said. The new system, which will be optional, is aimed at making it easier for district collectors to streamline the process of levying fines under the Disaster Management Act. Gupta said the system would run on the same lines as the e-challan system to collect fines for traffic violation in the state. “The new application will streamline the entire system. A violator will receive an SMS when fined, just as in the case of the traffic e-challan system,” a government official said. As things stand, there is no single system to collate data about total fine collection. Each local body collects fines, while the collectors maintain a record and use the funds for Covid-related work in the district. A consolidated figure is not submitted to the government. “This will bring about a uniformity in fine collection,” Gupta told TOI. “The app can be used pan-state but is optional as some collectors have already devised their own system,” Gupta said, adding, “We will keep the system ready, but hope people follow safety protocol ahead of the festivities and the impending threat of a third wave.” Last year, the state had invoked the Epidemic Act, 1897, and Disaster Management Act, 2005. Under the latter law, the administration imposes a fine of Rs500 on individuals, Rs10,000 on medium establishments and up to Rs50,000 on larger ones. A senior state government official said since the lockdown was imposed last year, an estimated 90,000 cases were registered in the state for DM Act violation. He said last year, the relief and rehabilitation department utilized Rs 826 crore and this year Rs 1,600 crore will be used on Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/agency-for-covid-fine-app-to-be-appointed-this-week/articleshow/86380157.cms||Nisha Nambiar

---||Pune||Pune: Workers toil round the clock to bring Metro project up to speed||PUNE: It’s a little after midnight and most of the city is fast asleep. But for Gautam Thakur and his team of four, the day — so to speak — has just begun. The five men are set to begin their shift, working on the Metro viaduct along the railway station on Raja Bahadur Mill Road. Wearing their safety harnesses and hard hats, the team steps into a “men lifter” that will take them to the site, where they will work till 5am. Thakur’s team is one of several working round-the-clock at various Metro construction sites spread on a 32km network across the city, in an endeavour to finish the project on time. According to Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited (MahaMetro), heavy work such as lifting and installing viaduct segments atop piers is planned for the night, while other, lighter civil work is carried out in daytime. Most of the workers are migrants, and all of them have been deployed around the clock to finish the project. It’s 3pm, just after the lunch break. Around 30 workers resume work at Anandnagar Metro station on Paud Road, which falls on the fully elevated Vanaz-Ramwadi Metro corridor. A small boom lift carries Jarynal Singh, a foreman, to the top of the roof structure, where he will carry out bolting work. “I started work around 9am; my shift ends in another two hours,” says Singh. Neither rain, nor clear skies and a hot sun deter Singh and his colleagues. “Our work includes checking the alignment of the roof structure and fixing the bolts,” Singh said. And they do it diligently, inclement weather or not. Virpal Girase, senior divisional engineer with MahaMetro, who is monitoring the progress, says, “The viaduct is ready on the Vanaz to Garware College stretch. Work at stations on this stretch has been expedited day and night.” Over at the Garware College station, 36-year-old Mahesh and his fellow worker Samodh Kumar are busy fixing marble tiles. “We work in the day shift which begins at 9am. We hail from Rajasthan and are experienced in marble flooring,” says Samodh. Hemant Sonawane, general manager (public relations) at MahaMetro, says civil work is underway simultaneously on three elevated stretches and the underground portion. “The sites have adequate lighting at night, and all workers are given necessary safety gear for work at night,” he says. Fast forward to the night shift: Momin Mallik, a senior foreman, and his team are busy stressing a segment of the viaduct near Pune station. At the same time, workers in Yerawada have started enforcement binding work at a site where segments are expected to be launched in the next few days. On some stretches, traffic is now allowed on one side of the road to allow work to proceed unimpeded. “We deploy marshals at these spots to alert and redirect motorists,” says Sonawane. As Puneites go about their daily business, upwards of a thousand workers will continue to toil day and night, above and underground, on a project aimed at transporting the city into the future.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/workers-toil-round-the-clock-to-bring-metro-project-up-to-speed/articleshow/86382364.cms||Sarang Dastane

The Rs 63.7 crore project, supported by the German Development Bank, sources water from the Ayyalamman Ghats as the work on sourcing water from the Cauvery bed at Srirangam was delayed due to the copious flow of water in the river.Thiruverumbur WSIS is being implemented in three different phases, of which two phases have been almost completed. New pipelines for around 211km were laid to link the water source with eight new overhead tanks in Thiruverumbur, which will benefit around 1 lakh people in wards 61 to 65. Last week, Trichy Corporation connected the pipe network to the Ayyalamman Ghats water headwork to test the pipelines. In case of any seepage, rectification work will be initiated. “Out of the total fund sanctioned, we have utilised Rs 52.9 crore so far. We are planning to commission the project before December 2022,” a senior official with Trichy Corporation said. Water connections for 17,636 properties were facilitated by the civic body out of the targeted 19,343 connections. The project commenced in 2016 and will benefit localities such as Thiruverumbur town panchayat, Pappakurichi, Ellakudi, Keelakalkandarkottai, and Alathur village panchayats that were merged with Trichy city in 2011 and renamed as wards 61, 62, 63, 64 and 65.Officials blamed the Srirangam residents for the delay as the locals had protested against installing a massive borewell in the Cauvery to source water. Even as the water utilisation committee comprising PWD officials gave the approval to establish a borewell in the Cauvery in July 2018, the residents opposed the move fearing a depletion in the groundwater table. “Once the water flow in the Cauvery dwindles, we have planned to resume the civil work on the water source proposed near Melur. Till then, we will facilitate alternative water supply from a stand-by source,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-corpn-begins-trial-run-of-thiruverumbur-water-project/articleshow/86380121.cms||Deepak Karthik

---||Mumbai||Can’t compel Rahul Gandhi to admit or deny transcript: Bombay HC||MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Monday dismissed a petition filed by RSS functionary Rajesh Kunte for orders to enable him to rely on a transcript in a defamation complaint that he filed against Rahul Gandhi. Kunte had challenged a Bhiwandi magistrate’s order of 2018, that rejected his plea to admit in evidence a transcript of a 2014 speech by Gandhi, a copy of which the Congress leader had submitted before the HC in a quashing petition earlier. Kunte had filed a complaint in annexing a compact disc (CD) of an alleged speech by Gandhi which he alleged was defamatory to RSS in connection with Mahatma Gandhi’s assassination. Justice Revati Mohite Dere of the HC found no merit in Kunte’s petition and said the prosecution or complainant has to “stand on its own feet and prove its case on its own steam.” She said, “Merely because the transcript is annexed to Gandhi’s petition doesn’t make it a “public document” for Kunte to rely on. Gandhi’s quashing petition was dismissed by the HC, and he is facing trial in the 2014 case before the magistrate. Kunte, through his counsel Niteen Pradhan, had argued that by submitting a transcript of his speech from the CD annexed to the complaint against him, Gandhi was admitting the case against him. He sought the transcript copy under section 294 of the Criminal Procedure Code which stipulates that a document filed before any court by prosecution or accused can be proved by asking them to admit or deny its genuineness. The HC agreed with Gandhi’s counsel Sudeep Pasbola and advocate Kushal Mor and said that the an accused cannot be compelled to admit or deny any document against him. “The right of an accused to remain silent flows from article 20(3) of the Constitution (immunity against self-incrimination) and is sacrosanct in a criminal trial. No court can compel or direct an accused to admit/deny any document. It is also not the intent of the legislature under Section 294 CrPC.” The HC judgment says, “The question that arises is whether, in the facts, the respondent (Gandhi) can be compelled to admit... transcript of the alleged speech by taking recourse to the provisions of the Evidence Act. The answer is ‘No’.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/hc-cant-compel-gandhi-to-admit-or-deny-transcript-in-mumbai/articleshow/86383427.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Hyderabad||Faced with court cases, Telangana govt to hire law associates||HYDERABAD: In what could be a first such instance in the country, the Telangana government has decided to appoint law associates to fight various court cases. The move was possibly taken following a series of setbacks in courts and strictures passed against higher officials by the high court in several cases in recent times. With the government caught in thousands of cases in various courts where it is a party, these law associates will come in handy in assisting prosecutors, government pleaders and secretaries of departments, senior government officials said. To begin with, law associates will be appointed for about 30 major departments in the secretariat. “If the experiment clicks, more number of law associates will be hired for various departments,” a senior government official said. The law associates will assist in all the court cases and legal matters such as processing of files pertaining to court cases, interim and final orders of courts, preparation of counter affidavits, filing appeals in the higher courts and special leave petitions, etc. “These associates will act as liaisoning officers between the government and government pleaders and the advocate general office. They will also assist the secretaries in reviewing all pending cases and monitoring of cases. A notification has been issued to appoint them. They are being hired on a contract basis,” a senior law department official said. Sources said the government was compelled to appoint the law associates, as in many cases the state has not been able to file counters and appeals where its interests are involved. Secretaries and districts collectors are being summoned by various courts, especially the high court, for not implementing the court verdicts and for contempt of court. In some cases, even chief secretary Somesh Kumar had to appear before the high court. “Recently, there have been several instances where collectors and senior officers have been sentenced to jail and also penalised. According to an estimation, over 18,000 contempt cases have been filed against government officers of various departments,” an assistant secretary admitted. In some instances, the officers are not even aware of court notices as there has been no proper monitoring of cases. Officials recall that the high court had even asked for data on cases pertaining to revenue-related matters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/faced-with-court-cases-t-to-hire-law-associates/articleshow/86380149.cms||Koride Mahesh

A student of the statistics department paid Rs 1,760 last year for two semesters whereas this year fresh students are paying nearly Rs 8,000. The students stated that the government had ordered to reduce the fee by 15%, however, the SPPU has increased it when classes are conducted online. The fees are collected under various heads from students including form fee, admission fee, registration, skill based course, student aid, gymkhana among others. The student who took admission this year said that, “The government said not to increase fees and even the SPPU had announced that there would be no fee hike. Yet the admission fee is many fold higher compared to last year.

---||Trichy||Approach road to temple in tatters||Trichy: The poor condition of one of the main approach roads to the Samayapuram Mariamman temple is giving a hard time to people visiting the temple. The lack of signboards to the car parking area also makes people miss the correct road to reach the temple.The approach road to the temple branches off from the service road along Trichy-Chennai NH. The 1.2km road links the NH directly with the master complex of Samayapuram temple where visitors can park their vehicles and enter the shrine. However, the entire stretch, the only route for those arriving in vehicles has not been laid with bitumen. The road was also severely damaged in the recent rains, resulting in bumpy rides. “There are no signboards too. Devotees assume that they have taken the wrong turn and rely on locals to find the proper direction. While there is a fee collection for the entry, amenities are missing,” said N Saravanan, a road safety enthusiast from Thuraiyur.S Kannanur town panchayat which has control over the locality has been blamed for not relaying the approach road to the temple for years. “We will urge the local body to repair the road. Adequate signboards to direct devotees to the car parking area will be placed,” an official with Samayapuram Mariamman temple said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/approach-road-to-temple-in-tatters/articleshow/86380161.cms||---

The working group for all the three districts have been set up to assess the design and performance of the ongoing packages, to identify the issues in the district’s economy and incorporate them in the package and suggest new measures to ensure the delivery of services under the ongoing packages. The committee has also been asked to prepare a framework for regular assessment of progress of the package and improve the systems for monitoring the schemes under it. The state planning board has begun the preparatory works for the 14th Five-Year Plan and the annual plan for 2022-23. The working groups have been set up in all the priority sectors. The working groups have been asked to formulate the goals and objectives to be achieved in each sector in the next five years. The committees would review the existing policies, laws, regulations and the institutions in the respective sectors and assess their adequacy vis-a-vis the objectives being set for the 14th Five-Year Plan’s ambitions and objectives. The working groups have been asked to submit their final report by October 15. The committees have been formed for the three districts with the present district collectors — Swagat Bhandari (Kasaragod), A Geetha (Wayanad) and Sheeba George (Idukki) — as chairpersons of the committee. For Kasaragod and Idukki, former district collectors, D Sajith Babu and K Jeevan Babu, respectively, have been included as co-chairpersons. The committees also consist of independent experts, people’s representatives in the district panchayats and planning department officials. The chief minister had in February this year announced a Rs 12,000-crore package for Idukki to be implemented in the next five years. The package includes proposals to increase productivity in farming and animal husbandry, promotion of value-added processing industries, tourism, physical and social sectors, restoration of ecological balance and poverty eradication. The chief minister had also announced a Rs 7,000-crore development package for Wayanad for the next five years with focus on better production and marketing of Wayanad coffee and spices, infrastructural developments, including a new medical college, tourism and irrigation sectors.

While not a single Plaster of Paris (PoP) idol was sold or installed anywhere in the city, for first time no immersion was carried out in thehistoric Ramala Lake. The Chandrapur Municipal Corporation (CMC) ensured strict implementation of restriction on PoP idols and banned immersion of idols in Ramala Lake to control water pollution. A massive awareness drive was undertaken by CMC to educate people about the ill effects of PoP idols. People were also informed about the importance of immersion of idols in artificial tanks. “We held a meeting of idol makers and sellers along with NGOs and ensured that prohibition on PoP idol was strictly followed. Inspection teams from the corporation made surprise visits to idol shops to check illegal sale of PoP idols,” said additional commissioner, CMC, Vipin Paliwal. Last year, 1,049 idols made of PoP were found during immersion. However, coordinated efforts this year ensured that not a single PoP idol was sold or immersed anywhere in the city. “We even returned clay collected in immersion tanks to idol makers for reuse,” Paliwal said. Nearly 27 artificial immersion tanks and 19 nirmalya kalash (bins for collection of garlands) were set up in the city. Three mobile tanks were also pressed into service to ensure immersion of idols in the most eco-friendly manner. Almost 8,064 Ganesh idols were immersed in the artificial immersion tanks. “While Ramala Lake, which is in the heart of the city, was prohibited for immersion of idols, we made arrangements for immersion of idols at Datala point at the Irai River,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/chanda-shuns-pop-idols-no-immersion-in-ramala-lake/articleshow/86377318.cms||Mazhar Ali

Persons with disabilities (PwD), senior citizens and bedridden patients were covered under the programme by an exclusive mobile health team. The civic body anticipates the demand to sustain in the coming days as people may contact the helpline provided for the purpose.Although there were hiccups in the conduct of the drive including a shortage of vaccines, the civic body managed to keep the initiative active. Old age and charity homes, special education institutes with accommodation facility for adult PwD students were covered as part of the drive. Locals will register their contact numbers with addresses on the helpline 6385269208, which will be followed up by the health team. On an average, the helpline received 7 to 15 requests per day, an official said. “We inquire whether the beneficiary is either PwD or bedridden or too old to travel to the vaccination centre. Even the parents and caretakers are vaccinated to avoid wastage of vaccine,” a health officer with the corporation said. Finding the addresses of the beneficiaries was the most challenging part of the initiative. “Some people were apprehensive and questioning us whether we are using good quality vials. We tried to vaccinate transgenders, but the support was low,” the official said.

In her complaint, Ranaut has accused him of extortion and criminal intimidation among other charges. She has alleged in a public dispute with her co-star Hrithik Roshan, Akhtar called her sister and her to his house at Juhu, and threatened and forced her to tender awritten apology. Meanwhile, Ranaut’s lawyer Rizwan Siddiquee said she has moved a plea before the chief metropolitan magistrate seeking a transfer of the case from the in-charge court on the grounds that she has “lost faith” in it. He said they were “not comfortable” before the court and felt it was “biased against her.” Javed Akhtar forced me to tender written apology to co-star: Kangana RanautActor Kangana Ranaut’s lawyer Rizwan Siddiquee said she has moved a plea before the chief metropolitan magistrate seeking a transfer of the defamation case from the in-charge court on the grounds that she has “lost faith” in it. The transfer plea will come up for hearing on October 1. Ranaut (34), in a peach saree, made her way to court a little before noon. After marking her presence, some pending bail formalities were completed. Ranaut’s plea against lyricist Javed Akhtar (76) said, “The said accused (Akhtar) even had the audacity to then force me to tender a written apology to my said co-star (Roshan), thus, forcefully seeking to create a document (valuable security) in favour of my co-star.” Ranaut’s plea also said she was threatened with dire consequences and told by indulging in a public fight with her “most powerful co-star and his family” she will be making her life miserable because she would go to jail and later take her life. She also alleged her moral character was attacked through certain statements. “The accused through his acts of crimes has thus wilfully caused me immense mental torture and trauma which still continues to have a disturbing effect on my mind..,” the plea said. She said instead of being apologetic, the defamation case was filed against her. “I state that my family has now permitted me to proceed with this complaint against the accused...,” Ranaut’s plea said. Adjourning the defamation case to November 15, the Andheri magistrate court then said, “As the accused and her learned advocate has shown lack of faith and trust towards this court by making certain allegations against this court, therefore, at this juncture proceeding with the matter is not proper. Hence, by consent of both parties the matter is adjourned till decision of transfer petition filed by the accused,” the court said. Siddiquee said without providing any sufficient cause and reasons and without there being an order on record, which justifies compelling appearance of the accused in a bailable, non-cognizable and compoundable offence, the court was threatening issuing “an arrest warrant... Accordingly, we have lost faith in this court and have therefore made a transfer application....” Akhtar’s lawyer Jay Bhardwaj opposed his submission and stated the transfer petition filed before the Supreme Court is already disposed of. He contended that Ranaut was intending to evade legal proceedings, hence, she has taken a new stand. Akhtar’s plea for issuance of non-bailable warrant against Ranaut was rejected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/akhtar-forced-me-to-tender-written-apology-to-co-star-in-mumbai-ranaut/articleshow/86382415.cms||Rebecca Samervel

---||Kolkata||Overnight rain delays flights, inundates parts of city airport||Kolkata: At least 19 flights were delayed for anything between 45 minutes and 4.5 hours and several others were delayed by 15 to 30 minutes at the Kolkata airport owing to heavy rainfall. Large parts of the road leading to the airport, the stretch in front of the terminal as well as large portions of the apron area on the airside portion of the terminal went under water. There were at least three diversions as well. Two IndiGo flights — one from Hyderabad and another from Imphal — were diverted to Bhubaneshwar and another SpiceJet flight from Mumbai was diverted to Varanasi. “Between 8am and 6pm, at least 13 departures and six arrivals were delayed. The average period of delay was between 45 minutes and 4.5 hours. There were other flights that were delayed by 15 to 45 minutes as well. However, there were no cancellations,” said airport director C Pattabhi. Commenting on the water logging inside and outside the airport, a senior airport official said: “The approach road and a stretch outside the terminal in front of the arrival area got flooded as parts of the drainage system got choked because of the Metro construction work.” “Water was constantly seeping inside the airside area of the airport. Hence, the more we tried to pump out water from inside, there was more water entering from outside. We had to keep the water channel gates shut for some time. But water never accumulated on the runway and there was no disruption in flight movement because of waterlogging,” said the official. Early on Monday, an intense spell of rain caused major waterlogging on Jessore Road. A 1 sq-km stretch of Haldiram’s on VIP Road and Chinar Park on the New Town's main arterial road went under water as well, slowing down airport-bound traffic. TOI found several flyers reaching the airport late and literally running inside the terminal with trolley bags. “It took us more than 1.5 hours to cross the Haldiram’s connector. I hope I don’t miss my flight to Bengaluru,” said a man in his 50s, running with two trolley bags. Vistara and IndiGo issued travel advisories and waterlogging alert on Twitter’, asking airport-bound passengers to leave homes early. At Haldiram’s-Chinar park crossing, there was knee-deep to waist-deep water. Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation officials said they had operated all pumping stations but even then couldn’t clear the mess. “Water from Haldiram’s junction can recede only after rain water from Chinar Park gets flushed out first to Bagjola canal. But with the Bagjola canal overflowing, pushing back excess storm water onto the road, not much could be done,” said a BMC official adding that a solution can be reached at when a drainage pumping station opposite City Centre II mall close to Chinar Park junction in Rajarhat is ready.

Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, told TOI, “With the current pace, we can surely vaccinate all the eligible target population with the first jab by November, while the target for the second shot is 50%. Now, the vaccination quota is ideally distributed in the ratio of 70:30, meaning 70% for those awaiting the second dose and 30% for the first dose seekers.” Vikas Dhakane, additional commissioner, Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC), said, “We are taking various measures to speed up the daily vaccination in the twin towns. The deployment of additional ground teams for the vaccination, extra data entry operators, tie-ups with industries and bringing more private players in the vaccination drive are some of the key areas we are working on. We are sure, we shall soon take the daily vaccination up to 50,000 in the PCMC limits.” Activist Abhijit More said the local bodies should make sure that all sections of the target population were getting the shots, which could eventually save lives.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/100-target-population-to-get-1st-dose-by-nov-health-dept/articleshow/86380242.cms||Piyush Bhusari

The well had no protective wall to prevent such a mishap, forest officials said and added, the animal might have fallen in it while chasing prey at night. The incident came to light when Dnayneshwar Chaudhari, a farmer, found the animal dead in the well. A Junnar forest official said at least 13 leopards have died in a similar manner since 2018. Jayram Gowda, deputy conservator of forest of Junnar division, said these are accidental deaths. “Many wells on farms in the division are uncovered and were built some decades ago. Preventing such deaths can be challenging. Local forest teams have been told to remain in contact with farmers, who usually come to know of such incidents, to rescue animals,” said Gowda. In some incidents, Gowda said that forest teams responded quickly and rescued the animal from the well. “We have developed a proper mechanism to rescue the animals. Our local teams and staff are well acquainted with the procedure. As a result, they could rescue the leopards safely in the range,” he added. On August 30, a three-year-old boy sustained deep cut injuries to his neck and ear after he was attacked by a leopard at Rajuri village in Junnar taluka while playing outside his home. Junnar forest division has recorded 16 leopard attacks on humans in the past two years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/leopard-found-dead-in-well-in-junnar-village/articleshow/86380225.cms||---

An official in the agriculture department in Amravati division said that even there, less than 1% of the area under plough has been affected. Reports have been sent to the revenue department for compensation. This is expected to be one of the good years. However, there are also concerns that if rains continued there are chances that the soyabean crop may be affected. This is the second major crop of the region. On Monday, the India meteorological department (IMD) indicated chances of excessive rainfall in some of the pockets of Nagpur district in the next couple of days. According to information provided by the officials of regional meteorological centre (RMC), Nagpur, Vidarbha received 20% more rainfall this week compared to the average. “In the last seven days, the region recorded 39.2 millimetres (mm) of rains against the normal of 32.7mm. Gondia was the wettest with 114.2mm while Akola was the driest with 12.8mm rainfall,” said officials. As per the met department’s prediction, a cyclonic circulation is lying over Gangetic West Bengal and its neighbourhood, extending upto 5.8km above mean sea level. “As a result of this system, rainfall is likely to continue in Vidarbha for the next 3-4 days. Also, heavy rains are expected at isolated places in the region between September 20-23,” added officials. The district administration has also issued a warning to those living in the proximity of the dams as the gates can be opened any time to let the river water flow out. In Nagpur district alone, eight dams, which include projects of medium and small size, are already full to the capacity. On the whole, water level in 36 dams in Vidarbha is at 100%. These include the eight dams in Nagpur district also. Only three among the large projects are full. These are Poos in Yavatmal, Pothra and Dham in Wardha. The rest are all medium sized projects. Even last year the water level in a number of dams in the mid-sized category was at 100%, says the data maintained by the water resources department (WRD). The Totladoh dam on Pench river and the Kamptee Khairi reservoir through which water supply to the city is sourced are still at 85% and 78% level. Last year, on the same day, the two dams were 97% full. At the same time, the Chaurai dam, on the Madhya Pradesh side of the Pench river, is 92% full as against 89% last year. Discharge from Chaurai led to flooding in eastern Vidarbha last year. The situation cannot be compared to last year when there were floods in large parts of east Vidarbha. Small pockets being affected by excessive rains is normal, said agriculture department sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/despite-more-than-normal-rains-crop-damage-minimal-in-region/articleshow/86380215.cms||Shishir Arya

---||Kolkata||On rain-soaked day, dead fish float up at Sarobar||Kolkata: Hundreds of fish were found floating dead at Rabindra Sarobar, a national lake, in south Kolkata on Monday, triggering speculations on whether dissolved oxygen has got reduced in the water due to encroachment by some clubs and indiscriminate dumping of waste in the water body. Desite heavy rain on Monday, a few die-hard lake lovers visited the area and were left shocked by the sight of hundreds of dead fish on the pathway along the edge of the lake. “Due to the overflowing water last night, fish might have swam on the land, but it is a mystery why they died all at one go,” said Sumita Banerjee, a lake enthusiast who never misses her trip to the lake. “The phenomenon — called fish-kill or ‘die-off’ of fish population — is not uncommon at Rabindra Sarobar. It can be caused by sustained cloud cover. Phytoplankton are a main source of oxygen in ponds and lakes. Phytoplankton produces oxygen when there is sunlight, but they use oxygen at night. Oxygen does not diffuse well in water. Most water bodies require surface movement to generate oxygen. Wind works well. Add the effects of temperature drop and you have a recipe for disaster,” explained marine biologist Anirban Ghosh. However, the disposal of high quantities of organic matter into the lake cannot be ruled out as the cause of rapid reduction of dissolved oxygen, said Sandipan Mukherjee, a marine chemistry expert. “The moment there is a huge amount of organic matter in water, there would be bacterial growth at geometric progression and break down the organic matter. Sudden surge of bacteria to disintegrate the organic matter will require an excess amount of oxygen that they will absorb from the water, causing deficiency in dissolved oxygen. I suspect there has been much higher anthropogenic activities at lake than before which, I suspect, led to this fish-kill phenomenon,” he added. “This is not the first time such a huge number of fish died in the lake at one go . This is why we want a thorough investigation into water contamination. We have already written to KMDA to form a committee to carry out periodic tests of lake water and identify the source of dumping of organic matter. Rabindra Sarobar is the finest biodiversity hotspot in south Kolkata and fish-kill is a clear symptom that not all things are fine with the lake ecosystem,” said Somendra Mohan Ghosh, an environment activist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/on-rain-soaked-day-dead-fish-float-up-at-sarobar/articleshow/86378154.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

The body of Ramesh Lodhiya (43) was found on Monday when the firemen broke open the house. According to police, Lodhiya had not been answering his wife Vairagi’s phone calls for the past couple of days. The couple had been living separately for the past two years due to marital discord. Their two kids used to live with Vairagi. On Monday, when the calls went unanswered again, Vairagi became suspicious and went to check on Lodhiya. Since he did not open the door, Vairagi called the fire brigade for help. Firemen broke open the door and found Lodhiya’s body hanging from a ceiling fan. Police said that Lodhiya left behind an 11-page note. In the note, Lodhiya mentioned that he had taken the extreme step due to harassment by his old friend Krushnasinh Raizada, his wife Sobhnaba and six other family members. As the Raizada and his wife were in dire need of money, they had mortgaged their jewellery worth Rs 37 lakh with Lodhiya at his shop on Kothariya Road. Lodhiya had lent Rs 21 lakh to the couple at 2% monthly interest rate. After getting the money, Raizada and his family allegedly started threatening Lodhiya to return the jewellery by threatening to file a case against him under Money Lending Act, the note stated. They had even submitted a complaint at Aji Dam police station stating that Lodhiya was illegally running a money lending business and charging high interest rate. Due to the threats, Lodhiya had given Raizada Rs 11 lakh, however, the harassment continued. Tired of the threats and harassment, Lodhiya ended his life. Police suspect that Lodhiya died on September 18. Police officials said that once Lodhiya’s wife gives a statement and a formal complaint, an offence will be registered against Raizada and his wife.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/harassed-by-friend-his-kin-jeweller-ends-life/articleshow/86375696.cms||---

Forest officials said some villagers also reported hearing gunshots, suggesting that the Chinkaras were shot dead. “Based on these inputs, we carried out spot inspection, but did not find any bloodstains, empty bullet rounds or the carcasses of the animals,” Pune division deputy conservator of forest Rahul Patil told TOI on Monday. “The villagers could not recall the registration numbers of any of the vehicles involved the incident. We have sought help from the local police and are collecting CCTV footage of the roads leading to the village,” said Patil. The forest official said the villagers also handed over a video clip, claiming to have filmed the incident. “The video, however, is of poor quality and nothing is visible,” said Patil. A case was registered under Section 9 (prohibition of hunting) of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, and Indian Forest Act Section 26 (trespassing into reserved forest area) at the range forest office. Kadbanwadi sarpanch Santosh Kashid said, “I am not in a position to offer any comment as I have no first-hand information about the incident.” Assistant inspector Birappa Lature of Walchandnagar police said, “We are extending all help to the forest officials in examining the CCTV footage. We are also asking locals if they have any information.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/residents-claim-chinkaras-shot-dead-probe-on/articleshow/86380246.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Maya: Cong has shown political opportunism by appointing Dalit CM in Punjab just before polls||Lucknow: Congratulating the newly appointed Dalit chief minister of Punjab, Charanjit Singh Channi, BSP chief Mayawati on Monday said that he should have been appointed CM for the full term of five years instead of just five months before the next assembly elections. The move by Congress, she said, smacked of political opportunism to try and win the upcoming assembly polls in Punjab and indicated that Congress “did not fully trust Dalits even now”. She also slammed BJP in Uttar Pradesh for wooing backward class votes ahead of next year’s assembly elections. “Had this newfound love of BJP for OBCs been even remotely honest, it would have had a caste based census carried out and ensured that the reserved posts in government jobs meant for OBCs were filled up by now,” she said. Accusing Congress of being scared of the Akali Dal-BSP alliance in Punjab because of which it was forced to appoint a Dalit CM, Mayawati said she has learnt through various sources that Congress would not be contesting the upcoming assembly polls under Channi but under a non-Dalit member. She said parties like Congress remember Dalits only when they were desperate. “Take the example of Dr BR Ambedkar. Had Congress and Jawaharlal Nehru found a more capable person than Ambedkar, they would not have allowed him to be a part of drafting the Constitution. The truth is, that whatever legal rights Dalits, backwards enjoy right now, is a result of the Constitution drafted by Ambedkar. The little security enjoyed by religious minorities, especially Muslims, can also be credited to Ambedkar,” she said. The Dalit leader said that the double faced character of all anti-Dalit parties like Congress and BJP stands exposed and she is confident that no Dalit or backward in the country, especially Punjab and UP, would fall for the lies being peddled by any of these parties. “BJP too will be playing out its drama of being sympathetic towards OBCs in UP but people can see through this political opportunism,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/maya-cong-has-shown-political-opportunism-by-appointing-dalit-cm-in-punjab-just-before-polls/articleshow/86382416.cms||Neha Lalchandani

Her body was crushed, as was her head. A large vehicle must have run over her, police thought. It turned out that it was an elaborate plan to get away with murder — she had been killed by her live-in partner, who had “staged” the accident. Manpreet used to work at a garment store at Kashipur in Uttarakhand. Eight years ago, she got married to Sukhveer Singh, 29, a small business owner. They had a daughter, who is now five. But five years into the marriage, she fell for Nafees Ahmed, 26, a truck driver from Maniyawala in Bijnor. They moved in together. On Sunday, when Sukhveer, whom Manpreet had left three years ago, identified her body, another lead emerged. “He said Manpreet had been asking Nafees to marry her. Nafees did not want to,” a cop said. Sukhveer filed a complaint, naming Nafees as an accused. Nafees was booked for murder and causing disappearance of evidence. When he was detained for questioning, police said, he confessed to cold-blooded murder. “Nafees told police that Manpreet was pressuring him to marry her. He did not wish to do so. On Saturday, he told her they should go out on a drive and took her out in his truck,” Bijnor SP Dharamveer Singh said. “When they reached a desolate stretch, he hit her on the head with an iron rod. When she lost consciousness, he placed her on the road and ran his truck over her body and then her head.” Police found Manpreet’s Aadhaar card and phone on Nafees. He was arrested on Monday afternoon and sent to jail.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/man-runs-truck-over-lovers-body-tries-to-pass-it-off-as-road-accident/articleshow/86378166.cms||Harveer Dabas

The brutality of the attack was revealed in the autopsy on Monday which found 15 stab wounds on the body of the victim and a collapsed lung. The accused’s family has claimed the man’s mental condition is “unstable”. The victim’s family, however, told police that the accused was mentally sound and that his family was lying to save him from punishment. Imran (identified only by his first name) had allegedly stabbed his sister-in-law, a mother of four, on Saturday night. The 36-year-old woman was alone on the first floor of their house in Makbara Phase-1 under Katghar police station while the rest of the family was downstairs. After the attack, Imran tried to flee but was held by neighbours who heard the victim’s screams for help. He was handed to police and booked for murder. The accused was presented in court on Sunday and sent to jail. Station house officer (SHO), Katghar police station, Gajendra Singh told TOI that this wasn’t the first time the accused had tried to force himself on the woman. “During our investigation, we found that he used to harass her often. On Saturday night, he knew his brother was not at home so he made an excuse and went to the floor she was in. He tried to rape her and when she resisted, he stabbed her multiple times. She was brought dead to the district hospital,” he said. The autopsy showed 15 stab wounds and a collapsed right lung. “The accused’s family has claimed he had mental issues.

The association has said the students can immediately start classes after the CET results are declared and allotments are made having already lost several days of academics. Ramdas Pol of the association said the diploma results were announced long ago and for one month or more these students have been just waiting for the admissions to begin. “At the same time, the classes of the second, third and fourth year students have begun. As a result, diploma students will lose out on the initial concepts of second year,” he said. Students who pass the three-year diploma get direct second-year admission to engineering courses.

Inaugurating the three-day training programme for the ministers being organized at the Institute of Management in Government (IMG), the chief minister said that giving priority to the requirements of the poor should be considered as the speciality of the LDF government. He said that during elections, people would be of two categories those who had tried to support the government and re-elect it and those who would have opposed it. But once in power, there are no supporters or opponents before the government but there are only people, he added. He said that the ministers should not behave in a partisan manner to anyone. The ministers might be having the experience of working among the public, but in administrative matters, the role of the officials are also equally important. If the opinions of the officials are found to be suitable, they should not hesitate to agree to those, the CM said, citing the example of the Life project, which was suggested by an official. He said that when there are several suggestions from several corners, there may be confusion on which one to agree to, and for this, it is very important to know the law and rules. “The ministers should work within the contours of law and rules. There may be outdated laws that will have to be replaced with new ones. For these, the ministers should take the necessary initiative,” he said. The hindrances coming in the way of administration should be dealt with lucidity, he added. On the first day of the training, former cabinet secretary K M Chandrasekhar explained the administrative system of the government. Chief of disaster risk reduction at UNEP Muralee Thummarukudy handled the online session on challenges in disaster management. Former IIM professor and managerial communication consultant Mathukkutty M Monippally spoke regarding leading a team.

The nearly 16-feet-high pillar, which will have a suitable foundation six feet below the ground, will also double up as a vertical garden with plants that have a fully functional drip irrigation system. Suitable lighting arrangements will be made for clear visibility of garden and metal sculpture art during the night. The pillar with a bust size art replica of Dr BR Ambedkar on one face and Mahatma Gandhi on the other is likely to come up near the entry of Telugu Talli flyover towards the railway station. The art work will be firmly installed on polished granite with the use of anchor bolts. The steel surface will be painted with multicolours and rust-proof powder coated materials. As Vizag is prone to frequent inclement weather, the pillar will be constructed in a way to withstand heavy winds. GVMC officials said the corporation has floated bids for construction of the pillar. The total works, including the vertical garden, lighting and other allied works, are expected to cost about Rs 14 lakh. The vertical garden is a concept to convert drab and limited spaces in urban areas to green spaces and is a big hit in several metro cities across the country. The metal sculpture will involve hundreds of different thin pieces of artwork. When put together, they offer interesting details, representing the imagination of the artist. Leading to the city’s railway station, the nearly 1.6-km-long Telugu Talli Flyover, which was opened to the public in 2013, sees high traffic volume during peak hours. However, other than those who go to the railway station or past the station, the majority mostly use the old roads under the flyover. All commercial structures and the city’s bus station are located under the flyover.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/gvmc-set-to-install-pillar-with-vertical-garden-3d-sculpture-of-natl-leaders/articleshow/86378171.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

Referring to Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren’s recent controversial statement on people who speak Bhojpuri and Magahi, Nitish said one should not speak in such a language for any political dividend. At the time of creation of Jharkhand in 2000, people of Bihar were upset as they used to go to the cities there.  But, today, Bihar is so developed that no one from the state wants to go to Jharkhand, Nitish said. “Does anybody today go to Jharkhand for employment,” Nitish asked. “I am not sure what people said ‘politically’ and I do not understand why such statements are made,” Nitish said when asked for his reaction to Hemant’s controversial remarks about Bhojpuri and Magahi languages. The Jharkhand CM, in an interview to a media House on the eve of Hindi Diwas last week, had said, “Bhojpuri and Magahi are not regional languages (of Jharkhand) but borrowed languages. ……Those who speak Magahi and Bhojpuri are dominating people. The locals of this place (Jharkhand) have been very weak. It is natural that the weak stays under the heel of the strong.” Trying to justify his government’s recent decision not to recognize Bhojpuri and Magahi as regional languages in Jharkhand, Hemant had also said, “When the movement (for creation of Jharkhand) was going on in Jharkhand, Bhojpuri expletives were hurled and (dominant persons) trampled the breasts of people who were agitating.” Hemant had also said, “The struggle (for creation of Jharkhand) did not take place because of Bhojpuri or Magahi language. It was fought drawing strength from the local tribal languages and regional languages.” Responding to media query over Hemant’s remarks, Nitish further said, “Bihar and Jharkhand were one entity till 2000. Jharkhand was carved out of Bihar in 2000. We have great respect for the people of Jharkhand. ‘Humlog toh unlogo ki izzat karte hai’. We have love for each person in Jharkhand.” While trying to cement the ruffled sentiments of people of both the states, Nitish said: “We belong to the same family. People need not make comments about each other. Actually, the entire people of this country are members of a family. But, Bihar and Jharkhand have some special bonding. We are brothers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nitish-one-should-not-comment-on-languages-for-political-dividend/articleshow/86377945.cms||Madan Kumar

There are a total of 56,633 teachers and non-teaching staff working across schools in the region. Of them, 46,432 (81%) have received both the doses so far while 54,802 (96%) of staff have received the first dose. The percentage of vaccination with the first dose is higher in government/municipal Corporation-run schools. “We will be able to ensure 100% full immunization of teachers and non-teaching staff in the next few days,” Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director, health services, Pune region, said. The Union government introduced 'teacher' and 'non-teaching staff' categories on the centralized CoWin portal to accelerate full immunization among the segment from September 1. Besides, the Centre has allocated more than two crore additional Covid-19 vaccines to states to vaccinate school teachers and non-teaching staff on a priority basis. Most teachers have had already received the first dose of the vaccine and the move about introducing the separate categories on the CoWIN is primarily meant to expedite full vaccination in the segment. “It is crucial for teachers and school support staff to get fully vaccinated as part of the preparation of reopening the schools,” Sanjay Patil, chairman of the Indian Medical Association of Hospital Board of India (HBI), said on Monday. Schools have been closed for almost 18 months now since March last year after the Covid-19 outbreak in the country. This has raised concerns about the cognitive as well as physical growth of children. Many states are considering reopening schools after Diwali. N K Arora, chairman of the National Technical Advisory Group on immunisation, had told TOI that states must expedite full vaccination among teachers and non-teaching staff. There are nearly 97 lakh teachers in the country. In August, NITI Aayog member VK Paul had said that almost 50% have already been vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/81-teachers-support-staff-fully-vaccinated/articleshow/86380335.cms||Umesh Isalkar

By Anant Chaturdashi, more than 1.6 lakh immersions took place at 73 natural and 176 artificial immersion spots, up from 1.4 lakh last year. While immersions in artificial ponds rose compared to previous years, still overall, less than half the total number of idols were immersed there this year. Approximately 2.65 lakh kg of nirmalya (flowers) was collected across the city. Of the 1.6 lakh visarjans this year, 79,129 were in artificial ponds, and 85,632 in the sea and natural water bodies. Around 70,200 Ganpati idols had gone to artificial tanks last year. The BMC said 34,452 idols were immersed till 6am Monday. Of these, 29,060 were household moortis and 5,043 from mandals. For the first time, the Lalbaugcha Raja was immersed on Anant Chaturdashi rather than the morning after. Neighbouring Ganesh Gully completed visarjan around 12.30pm. Interestingly other major mandals like Sahyadri Krida Mandal at Tilak Nagar chose to build an artificial tank bedecked with flowers in their precinct, and performed the ritual on site. Spokesman Jaya Shetty said, “We would earlier travel 12-14 hours to the seashore. Our message is that even big mandals are following the government's guidelines.” In Andheri (E), the Marol Cha Raja was given a unique farewell in a tub filled with 2,500 litres of rose water, said organiser Sagar Chonkar “Ganeshotsav was a challenge due to Covid-19, still it was better than 2020. Due to the height restriction on idols and ban on physical darshan, there were hardly any devotees. So mandals did not get any donations and advertisers backed out. Ancillary businesses like decorators and musicians were hit,” said Naresh Dahibawkar, president of the Brihanmumbai Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav Samanvay Samiti. In neighbouring Navi Mumbai, a total of 5,933 idols were immersed on Sunday, including 90 sarvajanik idols in all the eight wards of the civic body. Of the total number, 2,436 idols were led to artificial ponds. Overall, through the festival, 50 tonnes of wet and dry nirmalya (mainly flowers, garlands and idol decorations) were collected in specially designed kiosks at various immersion sites. This will help the solid waste management of the city, said civic officials. In Thane, 4,536 idols, both household and sarvajanik, were immersed on Anant Chaturdashi. Around 2,050 devotees opted for online time slot booking facility started by the civic body to facilitate easy immersion at various sites. As many as 3,567 antigen tests were also conducted at 24 spots.

---||Dehradun||Borewell ‘diverting’ water from villages to luxury villas, locals stage stir||Nainital: Six villages of Nainital, already dealing with water shortage, could face a worsening crisis because of the commercial misuse of their limited resources. Locals from these villages and environmentalists staged a protest against one such project, in which a builder has been allegedly diverting a borewell’s water to luxury villas near Satoli for years. The borewell was dug almost a decade ago at Satoli, near Mukteshwar in Nainital, locals said. “The permission was for residential use. Now, a builder has operationalised it to supply gallons of water to luxury villa projects nearby,” said a protester at Satoli. “The hills don’t have a water table under the ground. Water is drawn from water channels, the only source of water for villages in the lower regions. If water is drawn out illegally, there will be nothing left for people living in these villages — Satoli, Peora, Diyari, Chatola, Satkhol and Sitla.” About 150 turned up at the protest. The protesters want the borewell in contention to be sealed and others in the Kumaon region, functioning without permits, to be shut. “Several households will be affected by this. The villages of Satoli, Diyari, Peora and others nearby already face water scarcity. Illegal borewells and water extraction to this extent pose a huge threat. The shortage will get worse if misuse like this is not stopped,” said Dr (Colonel) CS Pant, chairperson of Aarohi, a Satoli-based environment NGO. “It has to be stopped.” The district administration said it had taken note. A local official said, “We are aware of the protest and the issue will be looked into. If the owners of the borewell are found to be violating norms, action will be taken."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/borewell-diverting-water-from-villages-to-luxury-villas-locals-stage-stir/articleshow/86375760.cms||Prashant Jha

---||Surat||1,000 improperly immersed Ganesha idols recovered||SURAT: At least 1,000 idols of lord Ganesha were recovered from various canals and small ponds by a group of youth Sanskruti Raksha Samiti (SRS) and were immersed into the sea at Hazira. After noticing the pitiful condition of the immersed idols, SRS started the drive a few years back. In 2020 the group had recovered and immersed over 4,500 idols. This year, less idols were improperly immersed as there was an overall drop in the number of Ganesh pandals this year due to the Covid-related restrictions. The group doesn’t take any outside financial help for the initiative. “Every year after the immersion day we see Ganesha idols lying around. Instead of immersing them properly many people throw them in the canal or ponds. People should stop doing this,” said Ashish Suryavanshi of SRS. On noticing the condition of the idols post immersion the SRS was formed by the youths from Udhna. Several volunteers have joined the efforts and now they have members in different parts of the city. “We have made representations to the government with a demand to ban the POP idols completely. If the idol is made of clay it will dissolve in water immediately and we can prevent the insult of god by a few irresponsible people,” said Suryavanshi. The volunteers visit various canals and immersion spots. This year total 19 artificial ponds were created in the city by Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) along with immersion in sea at Hazira.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/1k-improperly-immersed-ganesha-idols-recovered/articleshow/86375769.cms||---

The 30 teachers who submitted their objections to the list also presented their cases to LUTA. “While preparing the list, LU has not followed the rule book for calculating teachers’ seniority,” said a member. He added that in the case of a few teachers who had taught at some other university before joining LU, previous years of teaching have not been added while making the list. In other cases, teaching years have been mentioned in university records but not added while making the list. In a number of cases, seniority of part-time teachers who were later regularised has been counted from the time they were part-time teachers.

While two others were rescued by local fishermen, one is still missing. Around 8.30pm, Shubham Nirmal (18), his brother Shivam, and friends Vijay Marathe (16), Vijay Patil (18) and Sanjay Tawde (20), all residents of Kasam Nagar, a chawl off Veera Desai Road near the Andheri RTO, entered the water to immerse Tawde’s household idol. As they got pulled in by the strong current, they started screaming for help. Fishermen rescued Marathe and Shivam and rushed them to hospital before the arrival of fire brigade. Through the night, firemen looked for the other three youths. “Search operations were carried out by a flood rescue team and lifeguards, along with navy divers and a police boat,” a fire officer said. They found Tawde and took him to hospit-al, but he was declared brought dead. Shubham’s body was fished out at 10.30am on Monday, a few hundred metres away from the spot where he had drowned. Patil is still missing. “There are lifeguards deployed at all immersion spots, but since this was not a designated immersion spot, there were no lifeguards,” said Prabhat Rahangdale, deputy municipal commissioner, disaster management. “Serach operation for the fifth youth was stopped on Monday night as Coast Guard divers can’t dive in the dark.

---||Rajkot||CMFRI scientists taste success in intercropping of marine fish||Rajkot: In a unique attempt, Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI) has conceptualized the idea of intercropping of marine finfishes in coastal shrimp ponds in Veraval. While the country is making progress in aquaculture, it's the first-ever successful attempt by the scientists at CMFRI to harvest two species of fish — Silver Pompano fish intercropping with Tiger Shrimp — in one pond under mariculture. Both these species are marine fishes and found in the ocean. However, a pond has to be created near the seashore to get saline water for the marine fish. According to the scientists, generally under marine farming, crops of one species at a time are taken in some states of south India. But intercropping, in which two species crop at one time, is not possible. The fishermen have to take a three to four months’ break in taking crops of two different species in an artificial pond. CMFRI conducted an intercrop harvest fair of marine finfish and shellfish last month in the presence of institute’s director, A Gopalkrishnan. This fair was to educate fishermen about intercropping and its benefits. Scientists claim the fishermen will be able to earn additional income by harvesting fish crops in this pond. Fishing is prohibited for three months in the ocean during monsoon and the cyclonic warning also eats into the limited fishing period. The catch near the seashore is also reducing because of pollution and climate change. In such a condition, fishermen can take fish crop in the pond using mariculture technology, they said. Divu D, station in-charge of Veraval CMFRI said, “We have trained some beneficiaries as master trainers in mariculture technologies who will help by providing hands-on training to other entrepreneurs.” Five entrepreneurs have signed MoUs with CMFRI to adopt this technology. The institute will handover the technology to the fishermen across Gujarat coast at Veraval, Porbandar, Mangrol, Diu, Okha, Valsad etc. The key objective of this programme is to develop entrepreneurship in mariculture by providing training and upgrading fishermen’s skill in mariculture technology so that it can be easily adopted in Gujarat. Mariculture is a part of aquaculture, according to official data India needs to produce 18 million tonne fish by 2030. The current production is 10 million tonne that includes aquaculture production also. The goal of 18 million is not possible without aggressive production of aquaculture and mariculture.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/cmfri-scientists-taste-success-in-intercropping-of-marine-fish/articleshow/86375873.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya
---||Goa||Low enrolment forces 14 more govt schools to shut: DoE data||PANAJI: The number of government primary schools came down by another 14 during the last academic year 2020-21 as state-run schools offering education from Class I-IV continue to close down in Goa due to low enrolment. Four schools in Pernem taluka, three in Bicholim taluka, two each in Ponda, Sanguem and Quepem, and one in Tiswadi shut down last year. A majority of them were Marathi-medium schools, while one Konkani medium and one Urdu medium school each also had to face closure, as per the Educational Statistics at a Glance 2020-21 released by the directorate of education (DoE). The number of government primary schools in the state is now down to 728 in 2020-21, as against 742 in 2019-20. Little over a decade ago, the number of state-run primary schools was over 1,000. Academics have long believed that a perception related to the quality of these schools is leading to reduced enrolment year after year. State education officials said that of the schools that have been shut down, a couple of them were recently amalgamated with neighbouring government primary schools which had relatively higher enrolment. But the long-standing issue of government primary schools struggling with low enrolment continues, as apart from the 14 schools that shut down, hundreds more are on the verge of meeting a similar fate. In Sattari taluka, 61 government primary schools have an enrolment of 20 or lower from Class I-IV. Fifty-three schools in Ponda, 48 in Canacona and 38 in Dharbandora have similar student numbers. The number of government primary schools with 20 or fewer students is 33 in Sanguem, 32 in Pernem and 30 each in Bicholim and Bardez. In Tiswadi, 11 government primary schools are on the verge of closure. The figure of such schools is 23 in the case of Quepem, 12 in Salcete, and seven in Mormugao. However, government-aided and unaided schools continue to flourish as their number has shown an upward trend in 2020-21, too. The number of such schools run by private managements went up to 411 during the last academic year from 407 in 2019-20. Of the surviving government primary schools, an overwhelming majority of 661 are Marathi medium schools, followed by 19 Konkani medium schools, 13 that offer both Marathi and Konkani medium, and 11 that have Marathi and Urdu as their medium. Five government primary schools have Marathi and Kannada as their medium, four offer only Kannada, three Hindi, two Urdu and Hindi medium, and two only Urdu as the medium.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/low-enrolment-forces-14-more-govt-schools-to-shut-doe-data/articleshow/86380449.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar

In this notice, the samiti has objected to institutional and other use of these properties by Mahatma Gandhi Darshan Museum and Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Governance and Social Sciences on the land of Hotel Laxmi Vilas and Kanak Bhawan. Vimal Chaudhary, advocate counsel for Sangharsh Samiti said the notice has been sent to chief secretary Niranjan Arya, Urban Development and Housing (UDH) principal secretary Kunji Lal Meena and JDA Commissioner Gaurav Goyal. After hearing the writ petition in May 2017, the Rajasthan High Court had ordered the state government to take possession of the hotel and Kanak Bhawan land and in future this land should be used only for park or garden use and not for other uses. “This order was given after hearing the petition filed by Sanjay Tyagi. Following the same orders, Jaipur JDA took possession of the hotel and building land in May 2017,” he added. The state government has now proposed to set up Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Governance and Social Sciences on the lines of Tata Institute of Social Sciences and Maharashtra Institute of Technology School of Sciences of Governance here. “For this, a plan is being prepared to demolish the hotel building and build an institute in the Kanak Bhawan, which is against the orders of the court,” said samiti president Yogesh Yadav. A source at town planning department said, “To open the institute, the JDA will have to change the land use change as it falls under the ecological zone. However, in JDA’s master plan 2025, the land of Laxmi Vilas hotel has been shown for commercial use.” The samiti, however, claims the high court has given a clear order to JDA that the hotel land will not be used for commercial use in future but only for park or garden use.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/central-park-samitis-legal-notice-to-officials/articleshow/86380452.cms||---

The class IV student was playing with a friend in front of her house when the minor boy took her to a secluded place and sexually assaulted her on September 16. The girl returned home crying and showed her injuries to her mother. The local panchayat asked the girl’s family to "compromise and take an undisclosed amount". The girl’s mother somehow managed to contact police on Sunday and lodged a complaint. An FIR was then registered under section 376 (rape) of the IPC and relevant sections of the Pocso Act. The girl’s mother alleged that she was put under house arrest by a few influential persons of her village which is why it took her time to file the complaint. The boy, a student of class VIII, is in police custody and was sent to a juvenile home on Monday. The girl's medical examination has been completed. Bareilly SSP Rohit Singh Sajwan told TOI, “The crime occurred last Thursday. A complaint was lodged much later as the girl’s kin were forced to compromise. As soon as the police came to know, a team was sent to the village and a thorough probe was carried out." The SSP further said, "We have registered an FIR against the minor boy and he has been produced in the juvenile court. I have asked the circle officer to investigate the role of local village head as the girl’s mother said he was the mediator in the meetings and was forcing the family to compromise. We are also looking at the other possibilities in this case.” (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/9-year-old-school-girl-raped-by-13-year-old-neighbour-in-bareilly/articleshow/86378321.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Allahabad||Devotees from other states arrive at Sangam to perform Pitru Paksha rituals||Prayagraj: After a gap of two years, devotees from far-flung districts and states started arriving in Sangam to perform Pitru Paksha rituals. Pitru Paksha, beginning from Tuesday, is observed by Hindus to offer peace prayers to their ancestors. This year, the Pitru Paksha will culminate on October 6. Interestingly, devotees arriving at the Sangam to perform rituals, contact the pandas and priests sitting at the banks of Ganga during Pitru Paksha while tracing their family roots. Shiv Shankar, a priest at the banks of Ganga told TOI that they keep a detailed record of every devotee who comes to them to offer prayers to ancestors. He added that the majority of devotees are drawn towards the Sangam to trace back their roots as the record holds the details of their forefathers including when they last visited the place. “When these devotees start their journey from their village\block\ city, they have a complete idea and details of the panda whom they have to visit to perform rituals said another priest adding many families come to Sangam for immersing ashes during Pitru Paksha or offer 'Pitru daan' and after arriving at the banks of the Ganga river, they find the names of their forefathers who had visited the Sangam city”, he added. These pandas, better known by the picture on the flags rather than their names, have carefully kept the family chronology of every pilgrim, irrespective of the time period when the pilgrim had visited the city last. And moving with the times, the new-age pandas are at the disposal of their jajman (client) on the internet too as some have their own websites. Clients on their part also contact the pandas concerned before starting their journey through technology. The practice of maintaining these vital records has been continuing for generations and the whole family is usually involved in maintaining them. Once a pilgrim contacts them, these pandas take care of everything the devotee needs, from performing rituals to getting aboard a boat. Pandas also follow the old rituals of maintaining records. They keep a detailed record of the names of every family member, including their addresses in a large size book wrapped with a red cotton cloth called ‘Bahi’. For keeping the records, names are penned down by a munshi (clerk) and then a signature of the jajman(client) is taken for authenticity. Moreover, the flags of pandas\ priests also narrate the typical symbols as the signs on flags speaks about the sign of the firm that they own”. Noted city astrologer Amitabh Gour told TOI that the Pitru Paksha commences after the full moon day, and it marks the beginning of the waning phase of the Lunar cycle. He said that it is a 15-day period of vast significance and rituals like Tarpan and Shradh are carried out to pay respects to dead relatives/ ancestors. It is believed that the unhappy souls of the deceased return to the Earth to see their family members. Therefore, to ensure they attain Moksha, people quench their thirst and satisfy their hunger by performing the 'Pind daan'. Moreover, prayers are offered, and rituals are performed to help the souls get freed from the cycle of birth, life and death.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/devotees-from-other-states-arrive-at-sangam-to-perform-pitru-paksha-rituals/articleshow/86380479.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||PGI-Chandigarh mulls opening physical OPDs soon||CHANDIGARH: With the PGI director keen on resumption of physical OPDs, sources said a meeting with heads of departments will be held this week to take a decision. “I am of the opinion that physical OPDs should reopen for the benefit of patients. In the advanced eye care centre, we have increased intake to over 200 patients a day. They are not even registered over the phone or online. They walk in and are being seen,” said PGI director Prof Jagat Ram. PGI closed physical OPDs in March 2020, when the Covid pandemic hit the city. Healthcare workers got infected and many patients also caught the infection. To prevent transmission, the institute opened a dedicated Covid hospital away from the OPDs and took to tele-consultation. “However, phone lines are limited as compared to patient inflow. I have been trying to get tele-consultation since the the last one week, but have been unable to connect,” said Harpal Bhatti, a city resident. Also, doctors feel that tele-consultation is not sufficient in most cases. “It can help manage follow up cases but not new ones, which need to be physically evaluated. Teleconsultation is a stop-gap and cannot replace physical OPDs,” said a faculty in PGI. PGI received more than 10,000 patients in its OPDs daily prior to tele-consultation. “Most of the departments have been calling their follow up cases without tele registration. However, this limits other patients from visiting. Therefore, it is high time that physical OPDs are resumed. All the other hospitals, including GMCH 32 and GMSH 16 have been seeing patients in physical OPDs,” said a faculty in PGI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pgi-mulls-opening-physical-opds-soon/articleshow/86378325.cms||Shimona Kanwar

Jayapalan P R, who resides at Pooppanaparambil House, Maradu, was the winner. Jayapalan, who is fondly called Kannan, stays near Kottaaram Bhagavathy temple and is an autodriver at the Ambedkar Junction auto stand at Maradu. Jayapalan, a self-made man, hails from a poor family. He has been looking after his family, which includes his 95-year-old mother Lakshmi Bhai, wife Mani and two sons, Vyshakh, who is an electrician and Vishnu, a homeo doctor. His wife Mani is working as a sweeper in Chottanikkara homeo hospital. “I bought the prize-winning ticket from Meenakshi lotteries near Statue Junction on September 10 as I felt that it was a fancy number,” Jayapalan said. He said that he sat silent even as rumours spread about the ‘winner’ as he had the real ticket with him. Perhaps because of his grounded experiences as a hard working auto driver, Jayapalan was found so cool and peaceful even after this great fortune and said the lottery has come as a great blessing to him. “I have vehicle and housing loans to be repaid and I will utilize the rest of the amount productively after discussing with my family,” he said. Speculations were rife since Sunday afternoon, when the draw was done, about the winner of the Onam bumper. Initially, the rumour was that the ticket was jointly taken by three youths from Panackal. Then on Monday TV channels started to air a story that Saithalavi from Panamaram in Wayanad has claimed the ownership of the ticket from Dubai as his friend had bought the ticket for him from Kozhikode. All these rumours were put to rest by evening as Jayapalan revealed that he was the real winner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/maradu-native-wins-onam-bumper-lottery/articleshow/86380515.cms||Sivadas Varma

Compared to the past two years, when precipitation was 31-33% above normal, this year it has so far been normal. There is not much likelihood of receiving excess monsoon rainfall in the remaining 10 days of this season, the India meteorological department (IMD) said. “Light to moderate rainfall will continue and the seasonal total will be near or around normal value this season,” IMD said. The cumulative rainfall in Goa from June 1 to September 20 is 3,009 mm which is 5% higher than average. IMD records show that Goa received surplus rainfall in the past two years—2019 and 2020—owing to various weather systems. In 2019, Goa’s cumulative rainfall till Sept 19 was 33% percent higher than normal while in 2020 it was 31% percent more. Though monsoon activity has been weak over Goa for the past few days, the IMD has forecast higher rainfall activity in the state from September 21 onwards owing to two weather systems.  “Rainfall exceeding 6cm in 24 hours are likely in one or two places over Goa, from September 21 onwards, and improved spatial distribution is also likely,” IMD said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/this-monsoon-likely-to-be-normal-unlike-past-2-years/articleshow/86380547.cms||---

Almost 90% of these factories belong to the engineering industry. One manufacturing unit among these stands out with its unique concept of employee care. This unit has a gaushala in its backyard. The gaushala was started around two years back so that the workers and other staff of the unit can be served pure milk, ghee, buttermilk and other dairy products. “We started the gaushala so that our employees get unadulterated milk and dairy products. We started it when the Covid hadn’t struck us all. But it helped in employee retention during the pandemic. Because of this special care I never faced a manpower crunch even though 90% of workers at my unit are migrant labourers,” Kishor Tilara, one of the partners of the unit, told TOI. Shapar shares the characteristics of any other industrial area — its air is filled with stench emanating from chemicals and factory waste and ear-hurting constant industrial noises. Still, the gaushala, a brainchild of Kishor, sustained here. Started with six Gir cows the number has gone up to 19 now. Tilara has employed a family to maintain the gaushala. The milk and dairy products produced by the gaushala is served daily to the 225 staff of the unit. Every day the canteen provides the employees with one meal, milk, dairy products. The employees are not charged for these services. The food is prepared with ghee and the tea too has cow milk. “Our aim is to serve pure food to all the employees because we treat them as our family members,” said Dilip Suvagya, a HR manager of the factory. “We get around 150 litres of milk per day from the gaushala. Most of it is used to feed our employees while the remaining stock is used by the families of the three partners,” Ramesh Tilara, another partner said. Tilaras are involved in manufacturing and exporting of hot forged rings, bearing races, gear blanks for automotive and non-automotive segments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/gaushala-flourishes-inside-industrial-cluster/articleshow/86375983.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya
---||Mumbai||Climate change, pollution, agri practices causing illnesses: Study||Mumbai: A new study has established interconnections between climate, air quality and agriculture and their combined impact on public health. It categorises health impacts into heat-related illnesses (such as exhaustion, heat stroke, and cardiovascular events), pollution-related illnesses (such as asthma, enhanced risk of lung cancer, and chronic pulmonary diseases), and nutrition-related illnesses (such as anaemia in women of reproductive age, and iron and zinc deficiency). This interaction between climate, agriculture, and air quality to specific health impacts creates a composite picture of the effects on public health due to anthropogenic (human-induced) environmental changes, says the paper, titled, ‘A systems lens to evaluate the compound human health impacts of anthropogenic activities’. The study, published in the journal One Earth on Monday, calls for the attention of policymakers to consider these diverse and dynamic inter-linkages and approaches to public health through a comprehensive scientific lens. Using examples from India, the scientists have emphasised the need for better tools and local, high-resolution data on health, weather, emissions, air pollution, and land use to evaluate human and environmental impacts on public health. Prof Ashwini Chhatre, associate professor, Public Policy, Indian School of Business, who led the research in South Asia, said, “Agricultural practices impact air quality, but air quality also impacts agriculture, all amplified by human-induced climate effects.” Along with ISB, researchers from Columbia University, University of Washington, Boston University, and the University of Delaware have collaborated on this multidisciplinary research. India, the research says, is one of the most vulnerable regions to environment-related health hazards, owing to its high population density, high poverty rates, severe food insecurity, and over-reliance on agriculture. Dr Deepti Singh, assistant professor, University of Washington, and lead author of the paper said, “We are offering a framework to assess the overall health impacts from multiple parts of Earth's natural systems, which are all changing at the same time because of human impacts.” Dr Roxy Mathew Koll, Scientist, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, said, “Simultaneous exposure to extreme weather events due to large-scale climate change, poor air quality due to local air pollution, and food-water crises can lead to complex and compound health issues in developing nations. Another example is when seawater intrusion along coastal regions leads to diseases like cholera, but also compromises agriculture (food) and water quality over the region.” Dr Anjali Prakash, research director, Bharti Institute of Public Policy, said, “The IPCC’s physical science report which was released recently showed that there has been an unprecedented change in the climate induced by human intervention. This study takes the issue further and links climate change with public health. The pathways shown in this research can inform policy makers to make some tough decision to course correct the present pathways.” Dr Prakash is also coordinating lead author of the IPCC Special Report on Ocean and Cryosphere, 2019. “Climate and agriculture interactions are critical to understanding health impacts in South Asia due to the region’s extensive agriculture-driven land-use change, cropping patterns, and high prevalence of livelihoods based in smallholder farming,” explains Kyle Davis, co-author of the One Earth paper and assistant professor, University of Delaware.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/climate-change-pollution-agri-practices-causing-illnesses-study/articleshow/86382743.cms||Chittaranjan Tembhekar

Her in-laws allegedly turned her out of the house and did not allow her to take her two-year-old son either. Police have registered a case. Ravinder Kaur, a resident of Panchkula, filed a police complaint saying that she got married to Taranjit Singh on September 2, 2018 at Batta village of Mohali. She said soon after the marriage, she came to know that her husband was an alcoholic. Her husband and in-laws started demanding more dowry from the victim, for which they allegedly beat her up. She said her family gave Rs 70,000 to her in-laws, who forcibly took her jewellery. Despite this, she said she was beaten up on many occasions. When she complained to her parents, a panchayat was called and her in-laws’ family assured that nothing of the sort would happen in the future. However, she said the beatings continued and eventually, she was thrown out of the house without her son. She said when her parents went to the house to take her son, her in-laws used abusive words against her and her parents. She approached the police and a case was registered under section 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 406 (punishment for criminal breach of trust) and 498/A (Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty) of the IPC.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Two days after 17-year-old’s body is found hanging from tree, family alleges murder||NEW DELHI: Two days after the body of a 17-year-old boy was found hanging from a tree close to his house near Haiderpur, the family alleged that the teenager did not commit suicide but was murdered. They accused the family of a minor girl with whom the boy was believed to be in a relationship for the purported crime. The incident has taken a communal turn since the victim and the girl belong to different communities. “Our family has been in a bad state after I lost my wife two years ago,” said Hari Ram, the father of Alok Kumar, whose body was hanging from a tree with a red chunni. “We hadn’t recovered from that loss and now I have lost my son too.” The father also charged the girl’s relatives with thrashing them when he and others enquired from them about his son’s whereabouts. Ram insisted that his son couldn’t have killed himself, though he was unaware whether Alok was in a relationship with the girl. “Most messages on his phone are from that girl,” he did concede. The family of the girl has locked the house and left the locality. Security arrangements have been made to prevent an escalation in the tense situation. When TOI reached the residence of the victim, it found a crowd there, including some people who claimed to be members of religious organisations. Alok’s family, however, chose to keep their distance from them. Alok went missing on Friday evening, said Jyoti, 23, the teen’s eldest sister. “When we couldn’t locate him, we went through his phone to see if someone had called him for the usual supply of water bottles. We noticed a call and it turned out to be from the phone of the girl’s friend,” said Jyoti. “That friend identified the girl for us. We saw her messages on Alok’s phone were romantic in nature. I don’t know if they were in a relationship.” The CCTV footage in the locality showed the girl and her friend first coming to Alok’s house and then later leaving. The teen’s employer added that he felt Alok was up to something with the girl and had warned him not to be involved with her. Ram alleged that when they went to the girl’s house at night after Alok failed to return home, they were beaten up. “My other daughter is in hospital after being injured in the bust-up. We want police to act against the girl’s relatives,” said Ram. TOI found the girl’s residence locked. Neighbours said the family of five did not interact much with others. Police said no external injury marks were visible on Alok’s body. Inquest proceedings under Section 174 of the Criminal Procedures Act were started. “Initially, the boy’s family didn’t allege foul play and the body was handed over to them for the last rites. Later, they claimed the family of the girl had murdered the teen since they objected to his relationship with her,” said a police officer. Alok’s kin took his body to the cremation ground and protested on the road there demanding police action. “The boy’s family have filed a complaint and it is being looked into,” the officer said. “Legal action will be initiated as per the findings of the autopsy. The body was later peacefully consigned to flame at Haiderpur cremation ground.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/two-days-after-17-year-olds-body-is-found-hanging-from-tree-family-alleges-murder/articleshow/86380513.cms||---

Officials claim that around 48% of city residents have been fully immunised. The UT administration claims that all residents will be fully immunised by December end. With a daily average of 4,000 second doses a day, it might take longer to achieve the target. Though vaccination is a mode of Covid prevention, it does not offer complete protection against the virus and its transmission. A public health expert said, “Despite complete immunisation, there have been cases and also a few deaths, therefore, it is advised to wear masks and maintain social distancing.” On Sunday, the UT health department issued an advisory asking people to be prepared for the third Covid wave, which could be more disastrous than the second. However, a public health expert said, “Going by the decreased positivity rate in the country, increase in vaccination and development of antibodies in almost 67% of the population, it seems that we will not have a pandemic. It will be endemic--where the infection is limited to certain areas/pockets.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/thrust-on-second-dose-ut-aims-at-full-immunisation-by-dec-end/articleshow/86378352.cms||Shimona Kanwar

Scientists said it’s too early in the Covid cycle to ascertain if AY.4 is a matter of concern. AY.4 was found in 1% of the samples tested from Maharashtra in April as part of the Indian Covid-19 Genome Surveillance. Its proportion increased to 2% in July and 44% in August. A closer look at the August report showed that while Delta (B.1.617.2) was found in 111 (36%) of the 308 samples analysed, AY.4 was found in 137 samples (44%). Coronavirus live updatesAt the all-India level as well, AY.4’s presence increased from 5% of all samples tested in June to 8% in July and 45% in August. The last Indian Covid-19 Genome Surveillance report said while Delta and Delta sub-lineages continued to be the main variants of concern globally, AY.4 is the main global sub-lineage. Read AlsoCovid-19: What makes the Delta coronavirus variant, first found in India, so worrisome?Two factors set delta apart and make it potentially the most dangerous to date: First, it has about a 40% higher transmission rate compared with alpha, which already had a 50% higher transmissibility than the original strain of the virus. Second, it is also believed to cause more severe disease thanThe latest genomic sequencing series completed in the Kasturba Hospital lab last week, too, showed the presence of many “Delta derivatives”, including AY.4. “Delta and its derivatives, which were previously called Delta Plus, are not considered to be separate entities yet,” said a civic source. BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare said there are Delta derivatives in circulation, “but it is not significant”. The BMC team is in the process of correlating the Delta reports with clinical reports of patients to map out if and how the variants have changed Covid’s symptoms and severity. “A variant becomes a matter of concern only if we can establish it has increased transmissibility, causes severe infection and/or it can cause breakthrough infection,” said a doctor. The evaluation for AY.4 is on at a global level.

The latest release from the Insacog network of laboratories that maintain the Indian Covid-19 Genome Surveillance said there are problems with tools for classifying AY.4 to AY.25 lineages. “While Insacog has started reporting the new lineages for better epidemiology, they are all Delta for clinical and public health purposes,’’ said the release.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/delta-derivative-ay-4-soars-in-maharashtra-state-india-samples-but-not-of-concern-yet/articleshow/86380604.cms||---

Chadha asked zonal revenue officers (ZROs) to do a door-to-door checking in the area to rectify cases of incorrect billing, instructing them to check algorithmic trends of bills generated on an average, during the pandemic. He said erroneous water meter reading cases needed to be investigated by the officer, with the ZRO to be suspended, if bills were not rectified within a week. “It has come to my notice that in the last few billing cycles during Covid-19, the bills are being generated based on incorrect water meter readings. Algorithmic trends of all such bills have to be checked by the officers so that consumers can avail the 20kl scheme benefit. This incorrect billing has an adverse impact on DJB’s billing mechanism and it is absolutely essential for everyone present here to understand that all information fed on the tablets regarding water meters must be correct,” Chadha said on Monday during his inspection. He added that consumers had approached him with their grievances and concerns, with the vice-chairperson instructing the ZRO and the Joint Director Revenue to revisit all houses in the area to check meter readings. Chadha said no water bills generated on average will be accepted. As per DJB’s policy, if the meter read status is other than ‘OK’, then that particular read is considered as an average read.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/chadha-tells-officials-to-fix-incorrect-water-billing/articleshow/86380565.cms||---

The incident occurred on September 16 at Sainagar near Bibvewadi, where the businessman, Shekhar Mulik, met a man and exchanged a bag containing Rs2 lakh in cash for a newspaper packet purportedly containing UAE dirham notes. As it turned out, the packet contained cakes of detergent instead. Mulik approached the police on Sunday. As per the complaint, Mulik — a raw material supplier to food courts and cafeterias in malls and software company — came across an SMS, which contained a link and a cellphone number, and offered dirham at a low rate of exchange. “Mulik’s friend had first received the text message. He forwarded it to Mulik,” assistant inspector Rajesh Usgaonkar of the Bibvewadi police said, adding, “He had no plan of going to the UAE, but was tempted by the low rate.” Mulik called the number in the SMS and then, emptied his savings account and further, borrowed money from a friend. At 7pm, Mulik and a friend went to Kondhwa, where they met a man. “The man counted the cash and told Mulik to meet another man, who was waiting with the forex, in Sainagar,” the FIR stated. As per the FIR, they reached the spot at 8pm and met a man, who took the bag of cash from Mulik and handed over a red-coloured plastic bag. Mulik immediately found that there were two detergent cakes instead of dirham notes and tried to take back his bag. The suspect shoved Mulik and his friend and fled the spot. Mulik and his friend attempted to give chase, but in vain, police said. “We have booked two men and are searching for them. We have obtained some clues, including the phone number of one of the suspects that was mentioned in the SMS,” Usgaonkar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bizman-falls-for-forex-fraud-loses-rs-2-lakh/articleshow/86378389.cms||---

According to the teachers, Meena has been creating hinderance in the working of the university during the CAS promotion process. They said promotions have been pending for over a decade and the university was left with just four professors. Professor Jayant Singh, who was part of the protest said, “Ram Lakhan Meena has been creating unnecessary problems in the promotion process. It is better to remove such a member. He is creating problems for the university and not abiding by the orders of the Supreme Court for promoting the teachers.” On Sunday, Rajasthan University law Teachers’ Association had sent a letter to CM Ashok Gehlot requesting him to remove him as a member of the syndicate. They said Meena was terminated from the central university for misconduct in 2014 and the matter was still pending in Rajasthan High Court. Meena, however, refuted the claims of the university professors saying promotions were going on against the norms of the UGC. “Professors who retired from the university 10 years back are now being considered for promotion, which is against the norms of the government. UGC has even sent a letter to the university asking for an explanation. I am working honestly to save the university from dishonest people and just performing my duties as a government nominee transparently. These letters and protest is a way to defame me,” said Meena.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ru-professors-protest-against-govt-syndicate-nominee/articleshow/86380580.cms||---

The civic body has finalised work of five roads worth Rs391.7 crore in the first phase of the project. “These facilities will be developed using credit notes without spending cash from civic coffers,” said Hemant Rasane, chairperson of the Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) standing committee. The five roads are the development plan road near Baner hill (worth Rs18.7 crore), Sus-Baner-Mhalunge fringe road (Rs13.5 crore), Baner road near the national highway (Rs 8.5 crore), ring road near Ahmednagar road to Lohegaon to Pimpri Chinchwad (Rs215 crore) and Gangadham Chowk to Shantrunjay Mandir to Kondhwa (Rs 136 crore). A PMC official said the civic body allowed credit notes only for building permissions when they were first approved in January. The use of the credit notes was expanded for payment of other municipal charges such as property tax in July. The committee also approved a proposal to continue the Covid hospital in Baner for another three months. It has extended the contract with the firm, which is operating the facility. A decision to use pipe natural gas for cremation facilities was also taken.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/five-roads-flyovers-get-pmc-approval/articleshow/86378395.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Sealing of mall in Karol Bagh sparks BJP-AAP slugfest||NEW DELHI: The sealing of a building complex, which houses multiple shops, in Karol Bagh by North Delhi Municipal Corporation on Monday led to a war of words between AAP and BJP functionaries. An official of the civic body said the complex had been first sealed in 2013, but in 2018, it was found to operational after the seal was broken. “As soon as we got to know, a police complaint was filed and the complex was sealed. However, we received complaints of the shops at the complex having opened once again. On Monday, our team visited the place and sealed the complex at multiple places besides filing another complaint with the local police station,” said the official. A few hours later, AAP MLA Saurabh Bharadwaj alleged that the BJP-ruled civic body’s leaders had taken crores as bribes from the “mall”. Addressing a press conference, he claimed the mall was allowed to run for eight years and accused the north corporation of sealing it once again when the traders did not pay up. He alleged that Delhi BJP leader and former mayor Ravindra Gupta had been extorting from the traders. Dismissing the allegations as baseless, Gupta said he will file a criminal defamation case against Bharadwaj if he did not apologise. He said the owner of the mall had illegally de-sealed the building due to which it has been sealed again. Bharadwaj, however, stuck to his guns and said the mall was sealed and not demolished because bribes were taken. “The authorities knew about this and still took no action,” he alleged. He claimed that the shopkeepers had made the allegations against Gupta before reporters. Ravindra Gupta, in turn, alleged that AAP leaders were conniving with the owner of the mall. “Around 10 days ago, I had filed a complaint against the land mafia with Delhi Police and also CBI. A few days ago, Bharadwaj was praising me for exposing corrupt practices and now they are levelling allegations of corruption against me. It is totally baseless,” said Gupta. Reacting to AAP’s allegations, standing committee chairman Jogi Ram Jain said he has asked officials to conduct an inquiry into the matter. “We have yet to get the details on this issue and it would be too early to comment. After getting the facts, we will be able to decide,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/sealing-of-mall-inkarol-bagh-sparksbjp-aap-slugfest/articleshow/86380662.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Classes 6-8 finally open after 18 months, attendance thin||JAIPUR: Around 10% to 30% students of classes 6 to 8 attended as schools reopened across the state on Monday after a gap of 18 months because of Covid. In top schools that has good online class facilities, attendance was thin but in middle-income schools, it was better comparatively. Authorities of Subodh Public School said only 90 students out of 900 total from classes VI to VIII attended school. School PRO Sanjay Parashar said due to lack of transport facility and fear of third wave still looming, parents were reluctant to send their wards to school. Principal of Mahaveer Public School Rashmi Talwar said the response was very low as most parents have the option of online classes. In middle-income schools, attendance was slightly better than upper class schools. As online classes are not very good and most parents have no mobile phones, around 20% students attended classes. Anil Sharma, president of School Shiksha Pariwar, said on the first day, the attendance was not satisfactory because parents were still not ready. But they hoped that attendance would improve after a week. Most parents said this was not the right time to send children to school. Sunil Yadav, president of All Rajasthan Parents Forum, said they were against sending students to school. “The government should rethink their decision to reopen schools for small children. We are not ready for this and decision to reopen was taken just to exert pressure parents to pay fees. Even students from classes IX to XII are not going to school and they are expecting smaller kids to attend,” said Yadav. Jyoti Sharma, a resident of Raja Park, said she would send her children to school only after seeing the response of other students. Many schools have not reopened as they half-yearly exam would begin in September-end. St Xavier, St Anslem, Maharaja Sawai Man Singh Vidyalaya would open after a couple of weeks once the exams are over.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/classes-6-8-finally-open-after-18-months-attendance-thin/articleshow/86380620.cms||---
---||Delhi||No compromise on corruption: Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta||NEW DELHI: Despite nominating new faces for the municipal elections in 2017 to ward off anti-incumbency over allegations of corruption, Delhi BJP has yet again been forced to expel councillors barely six months before the next civic polls are due in 2022. Pooja Madan from Mukherjee Nagar (north corporation), Rajni Bablu Pandey from New Ashok Nagar (east corporation) and Sanjay Thakur from Saidulajab (south corporation) were expelled for six years on allegations of corruption. Former Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari had accepted that corruption did exist and they didn’t want it to continue. Asked if more councillors would be expelled as part of a purge and new faces introduced, Delhi BJP president Adesh Gupta said the party would not compromise with corruption and was committed to take strong action. “But that doesn’t mean we have a certain policy/plan to introduce new faces in the coming election. Those who have done good work and their performance and commitment towards the public is on a par with acceptable standards will surely be considered for the next term,” he added. Over the past few years, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has been blaming BJP councillors for corruption and mismanagement, which has allegedly led to the poor financial situation of the three municipalities. AAP has adopted an anti-corruption campaign as a major poll plank. AAP MLA Saurabh Bharadwaj and party in-charge of the corporations Durgesh Pathak accused ousted BJP councillors Thakur and Pandey for corruption in April and August, respectively. Asked if the recent action validated AAP’s anti-corruption stance, Gupta said, “AAP itself has lost its main plank. They welcomed an expelled councillor into their party barely a few hours later, which shows their double standards. We are at least reacting to the charges and taking action, but what about our complaints about corruption in DJB and other departments? Why has no action been taken?” Meanwhile, Madan said she was not served any notice regarding misappropriation or mismanagement of funds. “I had differences with the district president and this was communicated to the party leadership several times, but no action was taken. Also, I was facing a really tough time in doing any development work in my area due to the corporation’s cash crunch. This forced me to join AAP. BJP came to know about it three days before my expulsion, that’s why they expelled me hours before I joined AAP. Had I been corrupt, no other party would have accepted me,” added Madan. The two other councillors said they had no plans of joining another political party. Thakur said the letter came as a shocker. “I have been associated with the party for a long time and worked dedicatedly for 4.5 years. The party should have heard our point of view before issuing such a harsh letter,” he added. Pandey said, “I was not shown any proof of corruption. I’m not going anywhere and am waiting to prove my innocence.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-chief-no-compromise-on-corruption/articleshow/86380628.cms||Vibha Sharma

However, in recent months, locals have been reporting increased movements of tigers within the sanctuary area. The death of four tigers by poisoning reported from Golaulim in Sattari in January last year proved the presence of tigers in the upper reaches of the sanctuary. Recently, a male tiger was spotted in the forested areas of Goa, Karnataka and Maharashtra. The tiger had preyed on cattle belonging to Dhangar families residing in the sanctuary and its vicinity. During the rainy season, locals reported repeated sightings of the big cat in and around Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary, which was reaffirmed by the presence of scats, pugmarks and other evidence. However, camera traps failed to capture any footage of the tigers. Presently, the sanctuary has three female tigers, besides the adult male tiger. “We have already directed our field staff to carry out patrolling and monitor tiger movements in the sanctuary. Our efforts are gaining success to make the area a favourable natural habitat for tigers,” deputy conservator of forest, wildlife division, Jabestin Arulraj told TOI. The National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) in its report in 2020 had stated that the management of the sanctuary left “much to be desired” and without adequate strengthening of conservation efforts, the place may become a “death trap for tigers”. Unfortunately, even after more than two decades of declaring the Mhadei region as a sanctuary, it is managed on a completely ad-hoc basis “as there exist no management plan”, the NTCA report had noted. “Though, anti-poaching camps have been established in the Mhadei sanctuary, no proper protection mechanism exists. Increasing anthropogenic activities are posing a threat to tigers and their habitat here,” a wildlifer from Bicholim, Subodh Naik said. Range forest officer of the Mhadei sanctuary, Deepak Tandel told TOI, “We are in the process of constituting a tiger task team of our officials that will persistently work in protecting and conserving tigers.” Mapusa-based NGO, Goa Foundation, has already approached the high court of Bombay at Goa to direct the state government to act on the NTCA’s report pertaining to conservation of tigers in Goa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tigers-increasingly-on-the-prowl-in-mhadei-wildlife-sanctuary/articleshow/86380847.cms||Rajendra P Kerkar

The official said a discussion was held with the National Informatics Centre, which is developing an online system for doctors to register. “The system is expected to be ready by this week. With 10 days left for the month to end, we don’t think many doctors will register, and they have to become familiar with the new system,” the official added.

Though the incident took place last Thursday, what has stuck investigators is its possible link with the Jorasanko robbery that took place in an identical fashion last Saturday. Police said the second incident was reported from Mangala Lane area. The local Bowbazar police have registered a case under the Robbery and Arms Act even as the detective department is helping them in the probe. “Three unidentified men wearing masks and caps, taking care to conceal their identities, entered the shop. They threatened and silenced the employees present at the time, looted around Rs 60,000 and fled,” said an officer at Lalbazar. Like in the Jorasanko case, the accused had pulled down the shutters when they entered the shop. “ Besides local CCTV footage, call records are being checked. It seems they had an idea where to look for the cash. An insider link cannot be ruled out. Police have recorded the statements of all the victims and collected a list of all employees who worked in the firm in the recent pandemic,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/another-robbery-in-bowbazar/articleshow/86378489.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The mother, in her statements to the magistrate made soon after the FIR was lodged and also in court during trial, said she had not seen anything. The woman deposed that her children used to visit the house of the accused. She said that on September 29, 2017, when both her sons went to the house of accused, she heard her son crying. She found both the sons near the door of the accused and brought them back home. “She had not noticed anything. The people from the chawl gathered, they asked her to accompany them to the police chowky and said something ‘wrong’ took place with her sons. So, she complained,” the court said referring to the woman’s deposition. The accused has been out on bail since December 2017. The court noted that she had told the magistrate that the accused was a decent man. “He never stared at young girls in her house. This shows he is decent. She do not state to the magistrate there was any injury to the.. [private parts] of the child. She specifically stated that... people forced her to go to police,” the court said.

At a press conference organised by Soochna Evum Rozgar Adhikar Abhiyan here on Monday, social activist Aruna Roy said the first detailed draft of the bill prepared by civil society activists was launched by CM Ashok Gehlot in February 2019, followed by a draft prepared by bureaucrats in 2020, but the law was yet to see the light of the day. The activists reminded Gehlot that the bill found a place in the Congress manifesto ahead of the 2018 assembly elections amd also how the chief minister stressed the need for it in his first interim budget. Urging the government to urgently pass the bill, Roy said citizens across the state were not able to hold the government accountable legally for their delay and failure to deliver services. “The law that gives people the right to file grievances on account of violation of any policy, guideline, programme, legislation, citizens charter and get dated acknowledgement receipts,” said Roy. The Abhiyan presented the case studies of at least six persons who suffered to get their legal work done under several schemes due to negligence of the officers. “These are just cases we came across recently. There are countless citizens who suffer from an inability to access their rights, claim basic services, have their complaints redressed in a time-bound manner and have no accountability of errant officials causing distress to citizens,” said activist Nikhil Dey, adding that if the law was passed, it will be the first-of-its-kind in the world, bringing together accountability measures under one composite architecture. He said the Abhiyan would launch a statewide public campaign to raise awareness among people about the need for such legislation and a sustained advocacy campaign for the passage of the bill in the next assembly session. The state constituted a committee under the chairpersonship of the former state election commission, Ram Lubhaya, to advice the government on the drafting of the Social Accountability Bill in September 2019. Roy and Dey have been camping for the law since 2011. Both of them have held 100 day-long Jawabehi Yatra in 2015 across all 33 districts to build momentum for the Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/implement-accountability-law-urge-activists/articleshow/86380655.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Hyderabad||Telangana records 31% excess rainfall this year||HYDERABAD: Telangana recorded 31% excess rainfall this year, the highest in the country in all sub-divisional meteorological regions. Figures by India Meteorological Department (IMD) indicate that from June 1 to September 20, the state recorded 920.7 mm of rains as against a normal of 701.2 mm. As the southwest monsoon is inching closer to its withdrawal, IMD figures indicate eight regions in the country have recorded excess rainfall. Of them, Telangana is the most surplus state with 31% of excess rains, followed by Marathwada, Rayalaseema, north interior Karnataka, West Bengal, Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi, Konkan and Goa and Andaman and Nicobar. “This is the first time in the past many years that Telangana has recorded highest surplus rains in the country. It can be attributed to seven systems that the state witnessed into low-pressure areas, cyclonic circulations and troughs. Of them, two occurred in June, three in July and two in August,” said Naga Ratna, in-charge director, IMD, Hyderabad, adding that even now, rains are triggered by a trough extending from south interior Karnataka to south Tamil Nadu across Telangana. Telangana recorded 48% of excess rains by the end of southwest monsoon last year. However, it was not the highest in the country as Sourashtra Kutch recorded 126% of excess rains in 2020 . Experts have attributed this to change in weather patterns. “Usually, the weather systems developing over Bay of Bengal have a tendency to travel in the northwesterly direction towards Odisha, Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand. However, in the last few years, the track of monsoon systems changed and it is now travelling in the westerly direction across central parts triggering massive rains over Telangana,” explained Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, meteorology and climate change, Skymet Weather, an independent weather forecasting agency. Raising concerns over the change in weather patterns, climate experts said that the phenomena are here to stay. “This change in directions of the weather systems can be attributed to climate change.  We have to see if these systems continue to proceed westerly as against its usual direction to be able to confirm it as a change in monsoon pattern,” added Palawat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-records-31-excess-rainfall-this-yr/articleshow/86380676.cms||Preeti Biswas

They said need-based changes in CHB houses, which is a longstanding demand, has not been met so far. The federation demanded a policy for residents of CHB houses to give them relief. Association members said that garbage collection is not being done properly in a few areas, where collectors do not come every day and the garbage collected is not segregated. They said that the condition of sanitation had deteriorated even after paying crores to the private company for cleaning the southern sectors. “The issue of need-based changes in CHB houses has been raised from time to time over the last two decades. Politicians make promises during election times but forget when elections are over. What residents of 60,000 CHB units want is to have one-time settlement as has been done in Delhi. Secondly, there is the issue of conversion from leasehold to freehold at allotment rates and not on new rates, which run into lakhs. We should not forget that majority of this category of residents are middle class people who cannot afford to pay hefty amount for conversion,” FOSWAC members said. Federation members said that the MC had imposed the garbage management policy arbitrarily and needed to be scrapped or modified. They said that residents had to pay three times the charges without any value addition and that there were cases of grossly wrong and hefty bills. “We suggest that the work be handed over to willing RWAs. They will manage your garbage trucks and the MC will also save Rs 30 crore for management of trucks,” they said. They also raised the issue of increase in water charges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/foswac-raps-mc-chb-for-pending-issues/articleshow/86378445.cms||---

The incident was reported from Karrahi area under the limits of Barra police station. The police have arrested four friends of the victim and on the basis of clues provided by them launched a search operation in the Pandu river to fish out the body of the deceased. Mahendra Dohre, a resident of Khiria Kandor in Datia district of Madhya Pradesh, used to live with his brother-in-law Nandram at a rented house in city’s Karrahi Nai Basti area. Both used to earn their livelihood by selling ‘chaat’ in the area. Mahendra’s brother Surendra, who had come from their native place on Saturday, alleged that late in the evening hours of Sunday, a young man from Jarauli and his three friends had visited their house and took Mahendra with them over the pretext of outing. It was when his brother did not return home till late night hours, they launched a frantic search, but in vain. On Sunday, at around 11.30 am, their brother-in-law received a call on his mobile phone. The caller from the other side said that that Mahendra has been kidnapped and demanded a ransom of Rs 2 lakh rupees from him for his safe release. After this, three more back-to-back phone calls were made on the mobile phone of his brother-in-law, and the caller asked him to arrange and send the money quickly. Sensing trouble, Mahendra’s brother-in-law, however, approached the Barra police and informed the cops about the development. Immediately after collecting vital information, police swung into action and after tracing the number, managed to nab the caller and his three friends. Inspector Ajay Seth said that during interrogation, the accused have confessed to throwing the body of their friend after killing him into the Pandu river. They also admitted that they have also demanded a ransom of Rs 2 lakh from Mahendra’s brother-in-law. “To fish out the body of the deceased, searches are continuing with the help of divers in Pandu river.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/22-yr-old-youth-kidnapped-murdered/articleshow/86380714.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Biggest drug haul: How 3 tonnes of heroin worth Rs 20,000 crore seized in Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: In what is touted as the biggest drug haul from Gujarat and perhaps India, the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) on Monday declared the seizure of 2,988kg or close to 3 tonnes of heroin from two containers at Mundra port. The operation had been underway from September 14. Top officials said that the contraband could be worth Rs 20,900 crore if one considers the heroin rate in the international market to be about Rs 7 crore per kg. “The consignment was imported by M/s Aashi Trading Company based in Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh. It was declared as semi-processed talc stones originating from Afghanistan and was shipped from Bandar Abbas port in Iran,” said a senior official. “Based on specific intelligence, the consignment was intercepted by officers and the two containers were brought down for further probe.” It was a daunting task as in total, there were about 20-odd bags of about 2 tonnes of powder and semi-solid stones each. The officials roped in experts to assess the contents of each bag carefully and found 2,000kg of heroin from one container and 989kg from another. Sources aware of the development said that each consignment containing the contraband had the stones at the top, the talc powder in the middle, and the heroin powder at the bottom. It thus took more than four days for the officers to ascertain the exact quantity of the contraband. “The examination was conducted by the officers from the Directorate of Forensic Sciences (DFS), Gandhinagar. During the examination, the suspected narcotics were found from both the containers,” said the official. “The DFS report confirmed it to be heroin which was seized under the provisions of the NDPS Act, 1985.” The official said it’s considered to be high-quality heroin. Officials said that based on the information so far, searches have been conducted in Ahmedabad, Delhi, Chennai, Gandhidham, and Mandvi. Two persons have been arrested in connection with the haul so far. A Bhuj court on Monday sent them to custody for 10 days for further probe. “The investigation so far has revealed the involvement of Afghan nationals in the incident, too,” said an official. “Questioning is on to understand the possible destination, the operation of the cartel, and other persons involved.” Sources said that a couple from Chennai, currently living in Delhi, have been arrested in connection with the case. The agency however remained tight-lipped about their role. Sources indicated that the agency is probing the Taliban connection to the haul and the contraband might have made way during or after the power takeover by the new administration. “The probe is also focusing on the history of the importers and whether a similar modus operandi was employed earlier,” said a source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/haul-of-infamy-3-tonnes-of-heroin-seized/articleshow/86378497.cms||---

---||Delhi||Two from Delhi win 2021 universal design awards||NEW DELHI: Two Delhiites were among the 12 winners of the 12th NCPEDP-Mphasis Universal Design Awards 2021. While 20-year-old Madhav Ajay Lavakare was an awardee in the working professional category, Subhash Chandra Vashisth (48) won the Javed Abidi Public Policy award. In 2017, when Lavakare was in Class XI, his hearing-impaired friend dropped out of school because day-to-day communication was becoming an insurmountable problem. Lavakare, a resident of Sunder Nagar, tried to understand the problem better and began looking for solutions to help his friend. He learnt that most deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) individuals used a combination of assistive technology solutions for better communication, but they were often unaffordable, inconvenient, or inaccessible. After an intensive research of five years, Lavakare came up with TranscribeGlass, an assistive technology device for DHH and the elderly. It is an affordable, comfortable, accessible and convenient real-time heads-up captioning solution. Vashisth is a lawyer and a specialist in accessibility, universal design and diversity inclusion. The resident of Mayapuri said, “I have been working for nearly two decades on disability rights, inclusion, accessibility and universal design. I have also taken up several writs and litigation on disability rights.” He is also a Certified Professional in Accessible Built Environments level-III expert, the first in India to achieve this credential. He co-founded Centre for Accessibility in Built Environment Foundation in April 2016. The awards were instituted in 2010 by National Centre for Promotion of Employment for Disabled People (NCPEDP) in partnership with Mphasis. Of the total 72 applications received this year, the jury announced 12 winners in different categories. The winners would be felicitated in a virtual ceremony on September 28. Som Mittal, NCPEDP chairman, said, “The last two years have further highlighted the importance and urgency to bridge the gaps in accessibility and technology. The Covid-19 crisis has impacted the disabled the most. Universal design has to be in the very DNA of every field, right from technology to infrastructure.” “The pandemic has made all of us realise that universal design will be a non-negotiable feature to all technologies, services and infrastructure, in the future,” said NCPEDP executive director Arman Ali.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/two-from-delhi-win-2021-universal-design-awards/articleshow/86380702.cms||---

A few second year students had asked for character certificates as part of migration documentation. They asked for mid term migration as they had to join the cricket academy. Some had their own issues for migrating mid-term. For almost a week, students of Khalsa College have been fighting with the administration over character certificates. The work was both clerical and time-bound as students who would require character certificate for migration needed it immediately. The administration of Shri Guru Gobind Singh College, sector 26 was denying students their character certificates citing that it was against the law of migration under Panjab University and there were no guidelines for mid term migration. At this students staged a protest saying that they were deprived of their basic right. In a few cases, the character certicate was issued with a note saying, “It is applicable outside Chandigarh union territory.” Students said this was arbitrary. Soumya, from All India Students Association (AISA), sent a complaint to the director, higher education, Chandigarh administration regarding this arbitrary clause. Students demanded immediate issuance of character certificate and probe by the administration to ascertain the reason behind the arbitrary statement made in the character certificate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/after-protest-college-issues-character-certificates-to-students/articleshow/86378492.cms||---
---||Mumbai||If cases start rising, BMC set to buy 5,000 vials of cocktail drug for Rs 60 crore||MUMBAI: The BMC is set to buy 5,000 vials of a cocktail drug to treat Covid-19 patients in preparation for a possible third wave. With each vial costing Rs 1.2 lakh, the civic body is expected to spend Rs 60 crore on the purchase. Hospitals across the city started using the monoclonal antibodies since the end of May. Among civic-run hospitals, where it is being administered for free, SevenHills in Andheri has given it to the maximum patients. Each vial of the cocktail drug contains two doses. Since a patient requires only one, the BMC’s actual spending per patient will be around Rs 60,000. “We have got very good results from the cocktail. It has been administered to several patients at the SevenHills Hospital and the patients have responded well. We are completing the entire procedure and have kept things ready. Since the patient numbers are low, we are not placing the order right now. If there is a rise in numbers, we will place the order for 5,000 vials in a phased manner,” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner (health). Dean Dr Balkrishna Adsul said over 610 patients have received the cocktail therapy (see box) since June. “Barring one or two patients who progressed to need oxygen support, most recovered within days. There were no deaths among those who got the therapy,” he said. Lately, many hospitals have started administering the drug in day care. At least a dozen patients have been given the medicine on day-care basis at SevenHills. Dr Vasant Nagvekar, infectious disease expert and a member of the state Covid task force, said he has treated nearly 100 patients with the drug. Although the price remains prohibitive for many, doctors believe it becomes cost-effective since it cuts down the duration of hospitalisation drastically. “The results of the cocktail therapy have been great so far. We have discharged patients within a day instead of four-five days of hospitalisation. So, it also becomes cost effective for them,” he said. Further, Nagvekar said the drug has reduced the use of steroids and remdesivir. “The key is people must come to us early.” The cocktail was given to former US President Donald Trump when he had Covid in October 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-if-cases-start-rising-bmc-set-to-buy-5000-vials-of-cocktail-drug-for-rs-60cr/articleshow/86380799.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan register marriage bill under scrutiny||JAIPUR: The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) will examine the Rajasthan Compulsory Registration of Marriages (Amendment) Bill, 2021 passed by the assembly despite opposition last week. The bill seeks to register child marriages. The commission might take legal course if it finds the bill going against child issues. NCPCR officials claimed they were already facing challenges in preventing child marriages and with this amendment, they would have another conflict at their hands. Law experts claimed that while the amendment would safeguard legal rights of married minors and their children, the government needs to clarify about actions it would take against persons solemnising child marriages. TimesViewRajasthan has been infamous for child marriages and the government needs to ensure that existing laws are enforced with focus on prevention. While there is ambiguity about the law among people and even state officials, it cannot be denied that solemnising child marriage is a punishable offence. The state should concentrate on taking action against violators. The amendment, which may have been meant to act as a deterrant, needs clarity and has the possibility of creating chaos among departments that have to enforce the same.People involved in preventing child marriages said implementation of laws need to be stressed to curb social evil; amendment in itself does not mean people will register child marriages since there is no penalty provision if a person, including an adult, does not get the marriage registered. NCPCR chairperson Priyank Kanoongo said, “Our legal team is studying this amendment. After reading it, I found that this will make the situation more difficult for us when it comes to prevention of child marriages.There is already no concept of preventive FIR in such cases and now when we start registering child marriages, then it goes against the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act.We will study it in detail and go to court if required.” Section 8 of Marriage Registration Act provides that if parties to the marriage have not completed the age of marriage, the parents or guardians shall be held responsible to submit the application within a period of 30 days. However, activists who have been working in this field for decades claimed that this amendment has undone their years of work. Kriti Bharti, rehabilitation psychologist and managing trustee of Saarthi Trust who has been instrumental in getting 43 child marriages annulled said, “This is the darkest moment for me as while the government claims that they are trying to make the process of annulment simpler through this amendment, they have in fact complicated it further. If registration does not mean validation, then what does it really mean? No activist, no legal sources or victims of child marriages were consulted before this amendment was passed and now it will just lead to more challenges. Child marriage is a cognizable offence but we are giving it validation.” The government had clarified that registration of a minor’s marriage does not mean that it had become legal and it was for the officials to initiate action against violators. Giving an holistic view of the amendment, Ramakanta Satapathy, manager, child protection, Save The Children said, “Marriage registration was made compulsory over a decade ago and possibly this amendment is for safe guarding the rights of the children. However,the government should clearly state as to the action they will take against those persons who solemnise child marriages.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/panel-to-study-bill-that-allows-registration-of-child-marriages/articleshow/86380739.cms||Yeshika Budhwar

The fourth schedule of witness examination will begin from September 21. In the first schedule, the panel headed by ex-SC judge V S Sirpurkar examined principal Secretary (home) Ravi Gupta, Disha’s sister and investigating officer (IO) J Surender Reddy. While Gupta claimed police fired in self-defence, the panel mostly raised several questions on eye witnesses, injuries to cops and rules. IO Reddy was quizzed again in detail during second schedule in September. The IO was told to explain failure in collecting CCTV footage from Shadnagar PS, the private guest house where the accused were interrogated in police custody and from the prison where they were lodged during the judicial remand. The commission also pointed out that despite taking a long time the IO was unable to answer questions. The IO was also grilled about not furnishing hospital records of the injured cops and statement of the guest house owner. IO also admitted that fingerprints of the encounter victims were not found on weapons allegedly snatched by them. Panchnama witness Rajasekhar had told the commission that two accused snatched weapons from the CI and SI, and police fired at least 10 warning shots in air before opening fire at the accused. During the third schedule, headmasters of government schools where the victims studied were examined about credibility of entries in school admission records, based on which bona fide certificates were issued. The families cited school records to claim that two of the accused were minors at the time of the alleged encounter. Finally, the then tahsildar of Farook Nagar, J Pandu, who remanded the accused in judicial custody and subsequently also conducted the inquest of one of the victims, was examined. The Tahsildar admitted that he had signed on the remand report already prepared by the time he reached the Shadnagar PS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/disha-killings-sc-panels-4th-schedule-of-witness-testimony-set-to-begin-today/articleshow/86380776.cms||Mahesh Buddi

This is the second circular from a government department, earlier one was issued by the local self-government department in 2019 following a ruling by the Kerala state child rights commission. The circular gains importance in the wake of fears that children who have lost a parent during the Covid-19 pandemic could be married off by the guardians, forcing pressure on the surviving or vulnerable parent. “We have to close all the possible ways to prevent child marriages. The commission had issued the orders asking the government to ensure that places where marriages are conducted should insist on age-proof documents,” said K Nazeer, a member of child rights commission who had issued the directives while hearing a case filed by Childline in 2019. The WCD circular directs that the authorities can inform Childline or police or stop the conduct of marriage immediately in case of doubt. They can immediately call the officials. The LSG departments had in its circular warned that license of the establishment could be cancelled if it is known that their premises were used to conduct child marriage. The groom should have completed 21 years and the bride should be above 18 years for getting married. According to the official data, 87 children have been identified for financial assistance to be granted to children orphaned by Covid-19. But child welfare activists state that while these children have come under the state’s integrated child development scheme, there are several thousands who have probably lost one parent but are still vulnerable to pressures from relatives or due to the economic crisis caused by the Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/wcd-circular-seeks-age-proof-certificates-from-bride-groom/articleshow/86380792.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

---||Ranchi||Jharkhand: BJP refuses to be part of the all-party delegation||RANCHI: Opposition BJP on Monday rejected chief minister Hemant Soren’s call to join an all-party delegation to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi to press for a caste-based census. Earlier, Soren had written to Modi seeking his time to meet the delegation on the issue. Addressing a press conference, BJP state unit president and Rajya Sabha MP Deepak Prakash said his party will not join the delegation, accusing the ruling coalition of playing “petty” politics over the OBC reservation issue. His statement came on a day when Congress was hosting a meeting of all non-NDA parties as part of its move to form a united front against BJP both in the state and the Centre. He said, “We haven’t got any invitation to be a part of the delegation. Moreover, we don’t believe in their leadership. If at all we have to meet the PM, BJP will independently meet him. Why should we go with them? Congress and their allies are today shedding crocodile’s tears but never cared for the OBCs and the backward castes when they were in power. Only BJP and Modiji are the messiahs of the poor and downtrodden.” Questioning the agenda behind the meeting hosted by Congress, Prakash claimed that it was yet another “ploy” by the grand old party to dupe the people of the state. “We don’t know the purpose of the meeting called by Congress but BJP strongly demands that the Hemant Soren government implements the 27% reservation to OBC for jobs and education in Jharkhand,” Prakash said. He further said, “I came across a few statements made by some leaders of the ruling party that they will resort to a protest if the 27% reservation is not given. We want to ask Congress, JMM and RJD’s coalition government here who has stopped them from giving the reservation. Along with the 27% OBC reservation, the state government must also give 10% quota to the other economically backward people on the lines of the policy implemented for the purpose by the central government.” Currently, OBCs in the state are demanding 27% reservation which the ruling alliance parties had promised in their poll manifestos. OBCs now have 14% reservation in Jharkhand. The Union government has recently passed a bill in the monsoon session of Parliament empowering the states to decide on the hike of quota to the OBCs in their respective regions. However, several non-BJP ruled states are seeking a caste-based census in the upcoming nationwide population survey, claiming that without the actual figures of the existing population in different caste categories, deciding on the reservation is difficult. Prakash also lashed out at the state government over issues of the deteriorating law and order and alleged corruption incidents in the public distribution system among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bjp-rejects-cms-call-to-be-part-of-the-all-party-delegation-to-meet-pm-for-caste-based-census/articleshow/86380033.cms||ASRP Mukesh

Sources in the Rajasthan Congress say many now believe that CM Ashok Gehlot may no longer be able to postpone accommodating the rival factions, especially the one led by his former deputy Sachin Pilot, in the state government. Party workers feel changes could take place after the fortnight-long “Pitru Paksha” — considered inauspicious for any new initiative — that began from Monday. Read AlsoUnder fire, Congress says will fight Punjab polls under both Channi, SidhuA row erupted in Punjab Congress on Monday after senior leader Sunil Jakhar slammed AICC state in-charge Harish Rawat for purportedly saying the party would go to the 2022 polls under the leadership of state unit chief Navjot Singh Sidhu. Opposition BJP promptly latched on to Jakhar’s statement toThe demand for Cabinet expansion and reshuffle, political appointments in state commissions and boards and reconstitution of the Rajasthan Congress unit has been pending since July-August last year when Pilot and his 18 loyalist legislators revolted against Gehlot’s leadership. A day before the political manoeuvring that culminated in Amarinder Singh stepping down as Punjab CM, AICC general secretary in-charge of Rajasthan, Ajay Maken and Pilot separately held discussions with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in New Delhi. Maken, who played a key role in the change of guard in Punjab, is part of the AICC committee tasked to consider the demands of the Pilot faction. In the run up to the developments in Punjab, Maken told media that cabinet changes in Rajasthan would have taken place by now but for Gehlot’s ill health. “Through Punjab, the Congress high command has conveyed that it can act tough even against top leaders toeing their own line,” said a PCC office bearer. MLA Ved Prakash Solanki, who rebelled along with Pilot last year, told TOI, “Congress central leadership is now working full force. We are sure of a revamp soon here too so that we defeat BJP in the next election.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/captains-exit-gives-hope-to-pilot-camp/articleshow/86384951.cms||---

The food ministry and CSC e-Governance Services India (CSC) signed an agreement for this on Monday. The food ministry said this will help increase the income of ration dealers and the beneficiaries of highly subsidised foodgrains will get these services close to their homes. The CSC will now identify feasible activities that can be provided at the ration shops so that these can work as CSC Service Centres. The CSC will tie up with state governments for signing bilateral MoUs for providing interested ration shop dealers access to Digital Seva Portal (DSP) for delivery of CSC services. “All states have been advised to explore the possibility of increasing income and business opportunities of FPS by way of allowing them delivery of CSC services after due diligence,” the food ministry said. Moreover, ration card services provided by states and UTs such as application for new cards, updating existing ration card, Aadhaar seeding request, status check of ration availability and grievance registration can be explored by states through CSCs as an additional option. “This is at the discretion of the state government who will ensure due diligence regarding data safety, adherence to statutory provision and other relevant guidelines,” the ministry said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/soon-pay-your-utility-bills-get-passport-forms-at-ration-shops/articleshow/86384991.cms||---

Petitioners — Rajashree and her daughter Anisha Kamble, Vasudeo Ingole, Kamlesh Samarth and Shahnawaz Hussain — were booked by the GittiKhadan police under Sections 406, 409, 420, 467, 468, 471 and 120-B of the IPC for allegedly drawing a layout on forest department land near Gorewada and selling the plots, thus cheating 33 persons. The petitioners applied for anticipatory bail, which was opposed by intervenors led by counsel Shreerang Bhandarkar and others. Justice Vinay Joshi said, “The City Survey officials stated that they measured the land which was shown by petitioners”. Passing several strictures against the City Survey officials, the judge said that it is difficult to comprehend as to how they conducted measurements on government land without verifying the location from their original record. The court observed that officials cannot measure the land at the whims of owners, but it is their (officials) primary duty to ascertain the land from the official record. “Rather it was the main purpose of carrying measurement to locate the land, which itself got frustrated due to total negligence of the authority,” said Justice Joshi. Pointing out that the petitioners’ in collusion with City Survey officials had carried out a false measurement of forest land, the judge said one of them was present while conducting entire procedure, which means “he was aware about all the fraudulent activities”. The judge said, “The role of City Survey officers concerned, who carried out measurement, is not free from suspicion which requires thorough investigation. It is revealed from the statement that later they cancelled the measurement, since it was conducted on forest department land at the behest of Rajshree.” The judge stated that one more fraud surfaced when another land was about to be remeasured on the basis of forged treasury challan regarding payment of measurement fees. “When forged treasury challan was produced, the authority suspected and the fraud was disclosed. Suffice to say that falsity, misrepresentation and fraud are abundant,” the judge tersely said. Earlier, public prosecutor MJ Khan informed that some payments were made by cheque, but those were never cashed in by the vendor. “Apparently, the entire transaction is fishy. One can easily sense that Rajshree was well aware that the legal heirs of the original plot holder of another land were not the owners of the property, still she ventured into the transaction. Payment of sale consideration is also a matter of investigation,” the judge said. Stressing that the sold land was an agricultural one, he said unless it is converted into non-agricultural (NA ), layout cannot be prepared. “To remove this hurdle, Rajshree and Anisha engaged agent Ingole to procure NA order of the land. Rajshree paid Rs.9.30 lakh to Ingole, which speaks for itself. Prima facie, it appears that the Rajshree was so proficient that on the basis of old 7/12 extract in the name of original owner, and by use of forged NA order, she mutated her name to the city survey record,” the judge said. What HC said * Work of measurements on govt land at petitioners’ behest is suspicious * It puts a question mark on functioning of City Survey office * City survey officials can’t measure land at whims of owners * It’s their primary duty to ascertain land from official record * It was main purpose of land measurement, which was frustrated due to negligence * Petitioners’ in collusion with city survey officials conducted false measurement of forest land||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/fraudulent-sale-of-govt-land-hc-lens-on-city-survey-depts-actions/articleshow/86379808.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Business||Average salary hike in 2022 to be 8.6%: Survey||BENGALURU: Bengaluru: The average salary increment in India is expected to be 8.6% in 2022, buoyed by improved business confidence, says Deloitte’s Workforce and Increment Trends survey. The increments match the pre-pandemic levels of 2019. A quarter of the companies surveyed have projected a double-digit hike. The survey found that 92% of companies gave an average hike of 8% in 2021, compared with only 4.4% in 2020. Only 60% of companies had extended a pay hike last year. Deloitte's latest report surveyed over 450 organisations across seven sectors and 24 subsectors. Anandorup Ghose, partner, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India, said, “While most companies are projecting a higher increment in 2022 compared to 2021, we continue to operate in an environment where Covid-19 related uncertainty persists, making it harder for companies to forecast. Some of the survey respondents have also just closed their 2021 increment cycle, so 2022 increments are a fair distance away for them. GDP forecasts for FY 2021-22 were revised down after the second wave and we expect organisations to closely watch similar developments while managing their fixed cost increases next year.” The IT sector is expected to offer the highest increments, followed by the life sciences sector. The IT industry is seeing a strong demand from global customers who are embracing digital technologies more than ever before. Some digital / e-commerce players are also planning to give good increments. Retail, hospitality, restaurants, infrastructure, and real estate companies continue to project some of the lowest increments in line with their business dynamics. Organisations continue to differentiate pay increases by skills and performance. Anubhav Gupta, partner in Deloitte India, said top performers can expect about 1.8 times the increments given to average performers. “Going forward, specific increment differentiation may become more prevalent as attrition rates vary significantly across different skills. Compensation is usually one of the top reasons for attrition, particularly at a junior management level, where virtual hiring has made it easier to jump ships,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/average-hike-in-2022-to-be-8-6-survey/articleshow/86385062.cms||Shilpa Phadnis

MLAs who have been siding with Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu, including Pargat Singh, Kuljit Singh Nagra, Amarinder Singh Raja Warring and Sangat Singh Giljian, are being seen as probable choices. All eyes, meanwhile, are on loyalists of the previous CM Capt Amarinder Singh to see if they face the axe now. From Sidhu camp, Nagra and Giljian already are working presidents and Sidhu had appointed Pargat state unit general secretary, the top leadership will have to take a call if these leaders will be brought into the government. “The way new chief minister Channi went to meet Warring a day before his swearing-in has created a buzz around his name. He has been aspiring for a cabinet berth for some time now. Also, Gilzian’s possible induction will send out the right message of giving representation to an OBC leader and add to the endeavour of striking a caste equation,” said a party leader. Many from the rival camps, including Rajya Sabha member Partap Singh Bajwa, Lok Sabha members Mohammad Sadiq, Gurjit Singh Aujla and Jasbir Singh Gill, besides MLAs Rana Gurmit Singh Sodhi and Fateh Singh Bajwa, went to congratulate the new deputy CM O P Soni on Monday. Sodhi, besides other outgoing cabinet ministers like Gurpreet Singh Kangar and Sadhu Singh Dharamsot, is a known loyalists of Capt Amarinder and it is still not clear he and others like him will be brought back into the cabinet.

On March 23, Lakha Singh, 30, pleaded guilty to the affray and unlawful possession of a bladed article. Judge Jonathan Moreton Ferris of the Isleworth Crown Court on Monday sentenced Lakha to 12 months for the affray and 15 months for the possession of a sword, stating that he had played a leading role in the violence. The sentences will run concurrently. “That is a headline sentence of 15 months, of which you will serve half, and you have already done that,” Ferris said. Lakha was arrested after the brawl on the night of January 16 and is in custody since. The judge said: “In theory, you should be released on licence but being in immigration detention, you will be deported. You made slashing motions with the sword and it is not shown …whether you hit anyone, though you acted as though you might have.” Lakha entered Britain illegally and kept under the radar until his arrest on January 17. Two days, later the sword was found in a car park. Another Punjabi, Suhvir Singh, 23, who was arrested for keeping the sword’s sheath, was discharged after a jury found him not guilty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjabi-involved-in-southall-brawl-to-be-deported-after-15-month-jail-term/articleshow/86382233.cms||NAOMI CANTON
