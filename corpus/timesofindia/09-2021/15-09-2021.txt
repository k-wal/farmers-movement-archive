In Karnataka, the attendance was 80 per cent. The exam was held in 157 cities across India, including 23 in the state. There were 32 centres in Bengaluru. While 66,304 students registered for the exam nationally, 44,741 attended it. In Karnataka, 17,295 of 21,352 wrote it. ComedK holds key to 20,000 seats in 180 engineering colleges of Karnataka. ComedK and Unigauge — an entrance exam for 32 private universities in India — are conducted as a single exam with separate merit lists. A few obstacles were seen in Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh, where 120 students were scheduled to take their exam. The state authorities refused permission as an event in which the Prime Minister was participating was scheduled 1km away from the exam venue. An alternative arrangement was made to accommodate all candidates at a centre 10km away, said a press release from ComedK. Students from Jamnagar in Gujarat found it extremely difficult to reach centres in Rajkot because of unprecedented heavy rain and flooding of the highway, which resulted in only 50% attendance. Two centres in Chandigarh and Jalandhar were not made available by the government authorities on Monday night and another one had to be arranged. Said Amoda Hegde, a student: “The exam was as per expectations. Most of the questions were NCERT-based. Physics was the easiest, chemistry was moderate and maths was moderate to difficult.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/80-applicants-write-comedk-test-in-state/articleshow/86211553.cms||---
---||World||School vaccine campaigns targeting students face blowback||Fearing his parents wouldn’t approve of his decision to get a Covid-19 vaccine but needing their signature, Andrew signed up for the appointment in secret, and then sprang it on them at the last minute. They said no. Andrew cursed at his mother and father and called them idiots. Andrew’s dad grabbed him by the shirt collar. “He said, ‘You’re not getting this damn vaccine; you need to lower your voice. Watch your tone when you talk to me.’ It was, it was the first time my dad had ever done something like that — he grabbed my shirt and yelled in my face,” said Andrew, a 17-year-old student in Hoover, Alabama. In most states, minors need the consent of their parents in order to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Navigating family politics in cases of differing views has been a challenge for students and organizers of outreach campaigns, who have faced blowback for directly targeting young people. President Joe Biden has encouraged every school district to promote vaccines, including with on-site clinics, to protect students as they return to school amid a resurgence of the coronavirus. But several governments and school districts have taken more neutral stances in areas where skepticism of the vaccine remains prevalent. In Tennessee, the health department ended vaccination events and outreach aimed at minors following criticism of advertisements that featured children and included slogans like “Give Covid-19 vaccines a shot.” Republican lawmakers accused the health department of “ peer pressuring ” children to get the vaccine and criticized a top official who sent a memo to vaccine providers explaining that they could legally waive parental consent under Tennessee law. Nationwide, half of people ages 12-17 have been vaccinated. That age group has been eligible for the Pfizer vaccine since May on an emergency use authorization. Trials are underway for younger children. Full approval for the drug was granted by federal safety regulators recently for people 16 and older. Last week, the Los Angeles Unified School District school board voted to mandate vaccines for students 12 and older. In Molalla, Oregon, the mayor pressured a high school to cancel a vaccine drive on campus this semester, citing a $50 gift card incentive he equated with bribery. Many who called for an end to the vaccine drive expressed opposition to the vaccines, although Mayor Scott Keyser said he’s not against them. Misinformation surrounding in-school vaccination efforts has also eroded trust between parents and school districts across the country. School officials in Kettering, Ohio, received death threats in August after TikTok videos baselessly claimed the suburban Dayton district was vaccinating children without parental consent. There was no truth to the claims — they came out before the school year began, and spring vaccine clinics required parents to be present — but they caused “huge hysteria” in the community nonetheless, according to Kettering City Schools superintendent Scott Inskeep. “Our families really are struggling with both information and disinformation,” Inskeep said. “It’s like a match being put to a gasoline fire. When it starts it’s hard to put out.” In a total of eight states, all in the Southeast and Pacific Northwest, providers can waive parental consent requirements — Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Arkansas, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Alabama, according to a May review by the Kaiser Family Foundation. In some areas, there have been efforts to make it easier for kids to get vaccinated. State legislators in New York and New Jersey introduced laws that would allow teens to consent to vaccines without parental consent, but they were never passed. D.C. passed its law and is being sued by an anti-vaccine group. In New Mexico, health officials remade consent forms so that parents could sign them and send them with their kids, instead of having to show up in person. Elsewhere, some officials have tried to give parents more say over vaccinations for teenagers. In May, officials in two Oregon counties barred health officials from giving vaccines to kids without parental consent. Yamhill County Commissioner Lindsay Berschauer and the mother of three teenagers defended the move saying, “Our children are not the property of the State of Oregon.” But the counties backed down after state health officials issued a legal opinion affirming consent rights for children 15 and older. Berschauer continues to advocate against vaccine incentives for teens, calling the programs “peer pressure.” On paper, Alabama’s law is one of the more liberal, allowing minors like Andrew to get the vaccine on their own. In practice, that’s nearly impossible. The Alabama Department of Public Health requires parental consent as a matter of policy, and so do major pharmacies. The day after the argument with his parents, Andrew’s father took him to the pharmacy and signed, without saying a word. Andrew’s father confirmed his son’s account but declined to be interviewed. Andrew asked that his last name not be used out of fear of further upsetting his parents. Pediatricians in some cases try to facilitate conversations between children and parents and promote the Covid-19 vaccine. But it doesn’t always work, even with parents who have accepted their pediatrician’s recommendation on other vaccines, including for HPV and the flu. “They look at me like I’m suggesting that they feed their child poison when I’m recommending a COVID vaccine,” said Dr. Katrina Skinner, president of the Alabama Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics. Andrew’s Hoover High School does not promote Covid-19 vaccinations on its website or social media channels, and there’s no indication the school will host a vaccine clinic. School officials did not respond to calls and emails requesting comment. Alabama state health officials have been encouraging the vaccines among young people with a contest on the social media app TikTok that awarded $250 for the best video promoting Covid-19 vaccinations. One of Andrew’s schoolmates, Rotimi Kukoyi, 17, was one of four contest winners. He shared the video with his 18,000 followers, built over two years by making jokes. “I showed the CDC explaining how the vaccine is safe, and how it’s effective, and then I linked resources for people to sign up to get the vaccine,” Rotimi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/school-vaccine-campaigns-targeting-students-face-blowback/articleshow/86211972.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Karnataka: Cop fines driver who refused to transport body, suspended||BENGALURU: A sub-inspector attached to Gubbi police station in Tumakuru district who penalised a mini-goods truck driver after he refused to transport a dead body has been suspended. The incident was followed by truck drivers and local residents staging a protest against the cop, accusing him of indulging in corruption and being associated with the gambling mafia. Sleuths from Anti Corruption Bureau (ACB) are making enquiries based on a petition submitted by the residents. On September 2, a man died in a road accident near MH Patana and SI Jnanamurthy was supervising the case. A mini-goods truck carrying vegetables to Tumakuru from Arsikere passed by and Jnanamurthy directed its driver to carry the body to Tumakuru government hospital. The driver refused, saying the vehicle was packed with vegetables and he couldn’t place the body in their midst. “Angered, Jnanamurthy fined the driver Rs 7,000, mainly for overloading and improper documents like vehicle insurance, fitness certificate and permit. Since he wasn’t carrying that much cash, the driver digitally transferred the amount to the account of a woman police constable present at the spot. She withdrew the cash from an ATM and handed it over to the SI,” said a senior police officer. However, Jnanamurthy did not release the vehicle, which led to a protest by fellow truck drivers. “Initially, the protesters accused him of accepting bribe of Rs 7,000. Locals soon joined the protesting drivers and accused Jnanamurthy of corruption,” the officer said. A departmental inquiry was conducted against Jnanamurthy. “It was true that he accepted the payment digitally. But a detailed inquiry into the other allegations revealed he allegedly indulged in corruption and had joined hands with the local gambling mafia. So, he has been kept under suspension,” a senior officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/cop-fines-driver-who-refused-to-transport-body-suspended/articleshow/86211450.cms||---
---||World||US to hold $130 million of Egypt's military aid over human rights||WASHINGTON: The Biden administration will withhold $130 million worth of military aid to Egypt to pressure its Arab ally to improve its human rights record, two sources familiar with the matter, including a US official, said. Secretary of State Antony Blinken's move will be a break with his predecessors' policy of overriding a congressional check on military aid to Egypt. In the past, an exception was granted to free up $300 million in Foreign Military Financing for Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi's government on the basis that it was in the interest of US national security. A portion of the financing, $130 million, will be withheld on human rights concerns but will be available in future fiscal years if Egypt improves its record, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Human rights groups, which had called on the administration to withhold the entire amount, called the move "a betrayal" of US commitments to put human rights front and center in its foreign policy, and specifically with Egypt. "If the administration’s dedication to human rights were sincere, this decision would have been simple: withhold the $300 million in military aid as conditioned by Congress to incentivize al-Sisi to change course," said a joint statement from nearly two dozen rights groups, including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International. "Instead, the administration chose to ignore its commitment to human rights by evading the legislative conditions," it added. Sisi, who ousted the Muslim Brotherhood in 2013, has overseen a crackdown on dissent that has tightened in recent years. He denies there are political prisoners in Egypt and says stability and security are paramount. President Joe Biden has pledged to put human rights at the heart of his foreign policy and rights advocates have been pushing Washington to get tougher on Sisi, even though ties with Egypt have improved after Cairo's mediation to help end hostilities in April between Israel and Hamas militants. Criticism from rights groups on Biden's commitment to promote rights and freedoms worldwide is not limited to Egypt. They say while his increased emphasis on the issue is an improvement from the position of his predecessor Donald Trump - who praised authoritarian leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin - Biden has so far refrained from impactful action. Sources said a formal announcement on the Egypt decision could come later this week. A State Department spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Politico reported the move late on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/us-to-hold-130-million-of-egypts-military-aid-over-human-rights/articleshow/86212814.cms||---

---||World||US says nearly 500 Afghan citizens evacuated from Uzbekistan||TASHKENT: The United States said Tuesday it had evacuated nearly 500 "military and civilian" Afghans from Uzbekistan, while the ex-Soviet country declared there were now no Afghan refugees on its territory. The days leading up to the Taliban's capture of Kabul caused scenes of chaos in Afghanistan's Central Asian neighbours Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, as soldiers loyal to the crumbling government fled over state borders in military aircraft. Uzbekistan had mostly withheld comment on the number and status of the refugees as it looked to cultivate ties with the Taliban next door. But a US embassy spokesman told Tuesday it had evacuated 494 "military and civilian" Afghans out of Uzbekistan's southern Termez airport with the Uzbek government's help. "The evacuation was completed September 12-13," the spokesman told AFP by telephone, making no comment on the final destination of the refugees. Uzbek foreign ministry spokesman Yusup Kabulzhanov on Monday confirmed the evacuation in comments to the privately-owned Kun.uz outlet. "All Afghan refugees have left the territory of Uzbekistan", he said, without giving figures. A staffer at Afghanistan's embassy told AFP last month that up to 1,500 Afghans might have crossed into Uzbekistan illegally after the Taliban secured control of the northern stronghold Mazar-i-Sharif in mid-August and began beating a path towards Kabul. In a rare statement on the refugees in August, Uzbekistan said it had returned 150 people to Afghanistan at their own request and following talks with the Taliban to guarantee their safety. Tajikistan, which has eschewed official contacts with the Taliban, has been similarly secretive about the number of refugees it has taken in. The European Union's delegation in the country said on Tuesday that it was providing 160,000 Euros in humanitarian aid funding "to benefit up to 5,000 displaced Afghans" in two Tajik provinces bordering Afghanistan. The EU statement cited the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) as saying that "up to 50,000 refugees could be registered in Tajikistan after the total withdrawal of American and NATO troops by the end of 2021". The statement comes after Interior Minister Ramazon Hamro Rahimzoda earlier this month criticised international donors for failing to help Tajikistan house refugees. Afghanistan is set to dominate discussions at the summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation -- a bloc that includes four ex-Soviet Central Asian countries, China, India, Pakistan and Russia -- hosted by Tajikistan this week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/us-says-nearly-500-afghan-citizens-evacuated-from-uzbekistan/articleshow/86213052.cms||---

---||World||China views Quad talks as attempt to curb its influence||China views the upcoming meeting of leaders of the Quad countries — India, the US, Australia and Japan — as an obvious attempt to counter the challenge thrown up by its overwhelming role in international affairs. The Chinese foreign ministry said on Tuesday that these "countries should abandon the outdated zero-sum mentality and narrow-minded geopolitical concept and correctly view China’s development". For the first time, US President Joe Biden will sit down for a meeting with Prime Ministers Narendra Modi, Yoshihede Suga of Japan and Scott Morrison of Australia at the White House on September 24. The Chinese foreign ministry reacted hours after the White House announced the meeting of leaders of the Quad, or Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, countries, It will be held soon after the UNGA session that Biden will address in New York on September 21. The meeting is expected to work out a strategy to counter Chinese attempts to fully control the South China Sea, a major sea route. About 55% of India’s trade with the Indo-Pacific region passes through these waters. "The Chinese side believes that any regional cooperation mechanism should go with the trend of the times and be conducive to mutual trust and cooperation among countries in the region," Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said. "[It] should not target a third party or harm the interests of a third party," he said, adding that China’s rise had benefited the region and the world. A Chinese expert said this week that India is emerging as the "sixth eye" supporting the Five Eyes of intelligence-sharing among Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK, and US. "Although India has not formally joined the Five Eyes, it has established different forms and levels of intelligence-sharing with members of the group," Lin Minwang, a professor with the Institute of International Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai, wrote in the Global Times. "In this regard, China must be vigilant against the future impact of intelligence sharing between India and the Five Eyes". The US is particularly keen about making a success of the Quad grouping (described in some quarters as the Asian version of Nato) in view of the great loss of image it suffered after withdrawing its troops from Afghanistan. The withdrawal was seriously criticised in the Chinese media, which applauded Beijing’s diplomacy in building relations with the Taliban. The Chinese foreign ministry tried to explain that there is no such thing as a China threat. "I want to stress that China is not only an engine for economic growth in the Asia-Pacific, it is also the main force safeguarding peace," Zhao Lijian said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/china-views-quad-talks-as-attempt-to-curb-its-influence/articleshow/86213671.cms||Saibal Dasgupta
---||World||‘UK cancels third deportation flight to Pakistan in 12 months’||LONDON: A third UK home office deportation flight to Pakistan has been cancelled in the space of a year. The most recent flight was due to take off on September 8 carrying 25 people, according to a report in the Guardian. These may have been overstayers, failed asylum seekers or Pakistani nationals with criminal convictions in Britain. Pakistan refused to accept the home office charter flight as the UK has not removed Pakistan from the UK’s red Covid travel list, the Guardian stated, citing sources. But the Pakistan high commission in London has denied this. "The issue of the Covid travel red list was discussed between the two sides during the British foreign secretary’s recent visit to Pakistan. However, the assertion that there is a link between the cancellation of the flight and the red list is not correct," it said in a statement to TOI. Pakistan has been on the UK’s red list since April owing to concerns about the Delta variant and, unlike India, has not been removed yet, meaning that British passengers arriving from Pakistan have to spend 10 days in mandatory hotel quarantine and Pakistani nationals are not allowed to enter the UK. Two other deportation flights to Pakistan were cancelled in October 2020, the Guardian stated, citing an FOI request response. These flights were not given clearance to land by Pakistan, TOI understands. UK media speculated at the time that it was because the UK had not repatriated former Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif, who is in London, to face corruption charges in Pakistan. Each time the home office cancels a planned deportation charter flight it costs the British taxpayer about £100,000 (Rs 1 crore.) The home office refused to confirm or deny the Guardian report. A home office spokesperson told TOI: "People who come to this country and commit crimes should expect to be removed. That is why we regularly operate charter flights to different countries — to remove foreign offenders, and those who have no right to be in the country." Since January 2019 the UK has removed 8,441 people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/uk-cancels-third-deportation-flight-to-pakistan-in-12-months/articleshow/86213752.cms||NAOMI CANTON

The Audax event, popularly known as Brevet de Randonneurs (BRMs) was first held by Audax Club Parisien on September 11, 1921. To celebrate this centenary brevet, a special 200km BRM ride was organised across the world, by Audax affiliated clubs. Team WE R Cycling, organised a 200km ride on Kankanady-Kundapura-Kankanady route. Sarvesha Samaga, president, WE R Cycling, said, “There was a lot of uncertainty until late Thursday evening due to the weekend curfews, and once that was lifted everyone came together to be part of a BRM after a gap of nearly six months. Some of the finest riders from Mangaluru including Joseph, Shyam, Navin, Dheeraj, Ashok, Harivijay, Dr Ramraj, Anees, Muqthar, Dr Gururaj, Sreekanth, Shivananda, Gautham and riders from Kasaragod and Bengaluru participated. It was the first BRM for 16-year-olds Arnav and Tejas, who accompanied their parents. Meanwhile, Bhargav, Rajat and Sandeep kick-started their BRM journey, with a centenary BRM.” The ride was flagged off by senior rider Joseph Pereira and the star of ultra-races Dhanraj Karkera. The challenges were many. The riders said that they had to handle the harsh weather conditions including scorching heat, humidity, headwind and rains and unusual traffic from Kulur to Kankanady, demanded that extra effort to manoeuvre. To commemorate this event, specially designed medals from Audax Club Parisien France would be distributed to all those riders who have finished the ride in time. BRMs are rides of fixed distances that are to be completed within specified time limits, having successfully passed through pre-determined time controls. Each rider, who finishes the event within the cut-off time is awarded a certificate and a medal. Moreover, the rider will get a step closer to becoming a Super Randonneur and an opportunity to take part in one of the oldest and most coveted cycling events in the world, the Paris Brest Paris event, held in France once every four years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/cyclists-celebrate-100-years-of-randonneuring/articleshow/86208862.cms||---
---||World||US President Joe Biden nominates first LGBT woman to federal circuit court||WASHINGTON : President Joe Biden is nominating a Vermont judge who played a critical role in paving the way for the legalization of same-sex marriage to become the first openly LGBT woman to serve on any federal circuit court. The White House announced Thursday that Biden has tapped Beth Robinson, an associate justice on the Vermont Supreme Court since 2011, to serve on the US Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit. The court’s territory includes Connecticut, New York and Vermont. In 1999, before she was appointed to the Vermont Supreme Court, Robinson helped argue the case that led to Vermont’s civil unions law, the first legal recognition in the country of same-sex relationships — a forerunner of gay marriage. Robinson served as counsel to Vermont Governor Peter Shumlin, a Democrat, from 2010 to 2011. From 1993 to 2010, Robinson was a civil litigator in private practice at Langrock Sperry & Wool where she focused on employment law, workers’ compensation, contract disputes and family law. Robinson previously worked at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom in Washington, D.C., focusing on white-collar criminal defense. She was a law clerk for Judge David Sentelle on the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia from 1989 to 1990. The White House also announced that Biden is nominating employment law attorney Charlotte Sweeney for the U.S. District Court in Colorado. She would become the the first openly LGBT woman to serve as a federal district court judge in any state west of the Mississippi. Biden thus far has announced 35 judicial nominees to serve on the federal bench.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-president-joe-biden-nominates-first-lgbt-woman-to-federal-circuit-court/articleshow/86213867.cms||---

However, celebrations are low-key, keeping in mind the safety protocols that have to be followed amid the pandemic. The Ganpati mandals have not just reduced their traditional supersized idols with four-feet ones in accordance with the guidelines stipulated by the government this year, but some of them have also been trying to focus more on medical and health camps and vaccination drives, albeit on a much smaller scale. A stem cell registration camp was organised by members of the Mumbaicha Raja mandal in LalbaugMumbaicha Raja in Lalbaug, one of the oldest and prestigious mandals in Mumbai, held a health drive for one day this year. Kiran Tawde, president of the mandal, told Bombay Times, “We conducted a stem cell registration camp on Sunday at our mandal office, and around 522 people registered. Keeping in mind all the restrictions, this year we did just a one-day camp and followed all protocols and guidelines.” The Akhil Chandanwadi Ganeshotsav Mandal has arranged free check-ups at hospitals and is also giving free vaccines. Tejesh Sakpal, Vice President of the mandal said, “We have organised a general health check-up this year and our next COVID-19 vaccination drive will be held on September 16-17, for which we have tied up with a hospital.” Jaya Shetty, vice-president of Sahyadri Krida Mandal in Tilak Nagar, Chembur, shared, “Like last year, our Ganpati murti this year, too, is just four feet in height and we have not collected donations from residents. We organised a few health camps, including bone densitometry to detect early osteoporosis, a camp for women for a complete check-up, breast and cervical screening. We also have free BMI, sugar testing, BP check-up and Po2 check-up being held in association with Dr Pradeep Doshi till Saturday.” Shetty added that the mandal and its members are strictly following all guidelines and have created an artificial floral pond at the pandal site for the idol immersion. Meanwhile, some mandals in the city have either put their health camps on hold or haven’t organised them this year, owing to the pandemic. Subodh Chitnis, from Andhericha Raja Azadnagar Sarvajanik Utsav Samiti said, “We hold health camps and blood donation drives every year, but this year, we aren’t doing anything because we are following the official guidelines. We feel that if we have such activities, then people would flock to the mandals and we didn’t want that. People can participate in the aarti and do darshan online this year.” The smaller sarvajanik mandals and Ganeshotsavs held privately by large housing societies are also going easy on festivities and keeping a check on the number of people within the premises to ensure that the guidelines set by the government are followed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/ganpati-mandals-opt-for-low-key-celebrations-and-a-few-health-drives-amid-the-pandemic/articleshow/86212396.cms||Debarati S Sen
---||World||Blinken defense of Afghan policy clouded by al-Qaida warning||WASHINGTON: Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday sought to parry bipartisan congressional criticism of the Biden administration’s Afghanistan withdrawal, as new intelligence estimates warned that al-Qaida could soon again use Afghan soil to plot attacks on the United States. Blinken had mixed results in attempting to face down a second day of tough congressional questioning, this time from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. As a day earlier before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, he was assailed by Democratic and Republican lawmakers alike over the administration’s preparation for and handling of the pullout. Even lawmakers sympathetic to President Joe Biden’s decision to end America’s longest-running war by withdrawing from Afghanistan after 20 years expressed disappointment and concern about the large number of Americans, green card holders and at-risk Afghans left behind in the chaotic and hasty evacuation from Kabul. And, as Blinken testified just three days after the 20th anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks that led to the US invasion of Afghanistan, intelligence officials presented a bleak assessment that al-Qaida could begin to use Afghan territory to threaten America within one to two years. “The execution of the U.S. withdrawal was clearly and fatally flawed,” said committee chairman Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., who has been generally supportive of Biden’s foreign policy but has taken issue with several of its aspects, including Afghanistan. “This committee expects to receive a full explanation of this administration’s decisions on Afghanistan since coming into office last January,” he said. “There has to be accountability.” “The withdrawal was a dismal failure,” said Sen. Jim Risch of Idaho, the top Republican on the committee. He and virtually all of his Republican colleagues accused the administration of “ineptitude” that has cost the United States international credibility, led to a deadly attack on U.S. troops and Afghan civilians at the Kabul airport and left many in the lurch. “There’s not enough lipstick in the world to put on this pig to make it look any different than what it actually is,” Risch said. Much as he did on Monday at the often contentious hearing in the House, Blinken tried to deflect the criticism and maintained the administration had done the best it could under extremely trying and chaotic circumstances. Blinken again blamed the Trump administration for its February 2020 peace deal with the Taliban that he said had tied Biden’s hands, as well as the quick and unexpected collapse of the Afghan government and security forces that led to the Taliban takeover on August 15. “Even the most pessimistic assessments did not predict that government forces in Kabul would collapse while US forces remained,” he said. “They were focused on what would happen after the United States withdrew, from September onward.” Blinken said the administration would hold the Taliban, which hosted and protected Osama bin Laden and top members of his al-Qaida network as they plotted the 9/11 strikes, to their promises not to allow Afghanistan to be used again as a base for terrorist attacks. But as he spoke, US intelligence officials said al-Qaida may be only 12 to 24 months from reconstituting itself in Afghanistan to pose a significant threat to the United States. Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier, who leads the Defense Intelligence Agency, gave that estimate while speaking at the Intelligence & National Security Summit. Meanwhile, David Cohen, deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency, said the US already had detected “some of the indications of some potential movement of al-Qaida to Afghanistan. Experts have long said the Taliban still maintains ties to al-Qaida, which took sanctuary in Afghanistan prior to 9/11. Although Blinken was not asked directly about the intelligence assessments, he said the Taliban had not fully severed its links with the group. Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, a vehement opponent of numerous Biden policies, called the withdrawal “the worst foreign policy catastrophe in a generation” and accused the administration of being naive in hoping the Taliban live up to their promises of moderation. “They don’t want to be welcomed into the community of civilized nations,” he said. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., demanded to know how intelligence about the collapse of the Afghan government had been so wrong. He suggested not only that the wrong people were in charge of assessing the situation but that the policy had been incoherent and left the US vulnerable to rivals. “This was a failure of policy and planning,” said Rubio, another frequent critic of Biden’s. “I think China and Russia and Iran, they look at this botched withdrawal and what they see as incompetence that they think they might be able to exploit.” The State Department has come under heavy criticism from both sides for not doing enough and not acting quickly enough to get people out of the country after the Taliban took control of Kabul, cementing its hold on the country before the completion of the U.S. withdrawal on August 30. Blinken defended the withdrawal and the end of America’s longest-running war as “the right thing to do” after 20 years. And, he noted that despite severe difficulties the US and its allies had managed to evacuate some 124,000 people. “The evacuation was an extraordinary effort — under the most difficult conditions imaginable — by our diplomats, military, and intelligence professionals,” he said. Even some Democrats, though, were unswayed. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the only woman on the committee, who has long fought for the U.S. to protect the advances made by Afghan women and girls, lamented the current situation and said presidents and lawmakers of both parties shared the blame for the situation. “Let’s stop with the hypocrisy of who’s to blame, there are a lot of people to blame and we all share in it,” she said, her voice rising as she took a pointed dig at former President Donald Trump and his second Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who negotiated the 2020 peace deal with the Taliban separate from the Afghan government with no assurance that minority rights would be respected. “I want to know where the outrage was when they were giving away the rights of women and girls,” Shaheen said. In response, Blinken said he would soon be appointing a senior official to oversee US policy toward Afghan women and girls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/blinken-defense-of-afghan-policy-clouded-by-al-qaida-warning/articleshow/86214059.cms||---
---||World||US President Biden turns to Colorado to pitch investments in clean energy||DENVER: While legislators craft the details back in Washington, President Joe Biden is pitching his massive domestic spending package with a visit to a renewable energy lab in Colorado to highlight how the investments in clean energy in his plan would help combat climate change. The trip to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Denver capped off the president’s two-day swing to the West, and offered Biden the chance to continue linking the need to pass the spending package to the urgent threat posed by climate change. Biden spent Monday in Boise, Idaho, and Sacramento, California, receiving briefings on the devastating wildfire season and viewing the damage by the Caldor Fire to communities around Lake Tahoe. “We can’t ignore the reality that these wildfires are being supercharged by climate change,” Biden said, noting that catastrophic weather doesn’t strike based on partisan ideology. “It isn’t about red or blue states. It’s about fires. Just fires.” During both of his Monday stops, Biden held out the wildfires across the region as an argument for his $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill and additional $3.5 trillion package of spending. The president said that every dollar spent on “resilience” would save $6 in future costs. And he made the case that the rebuilding must go beyond simply restoring damaged systems and instead ensure communities can withstand such crises. “These fires are blinking ‘code red’ for our nation. They’re gaining frequency and ferocity,” Biden said after concluding his tour of the Caldor Fire damage. “We know what we have to do.” The climate provisions in Biden’s plans include tax incentives for clean energy and electric vehicles, investments to transition the economy away from fossil fuels and toward renewable sources such as wind and solar power, and creation of a civilian climate corps. Biden has set a goal of eliminating pollution from fossil fuel in the power sector by 2035 and from the U.S. economy overall by 2050. While in California, Biden also campaigned for Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who is facing a recall election Tuesday. Speaking at a rally in Long Beach, Biden framed the recall as a battle against “Trump Republicans trying to block us from beating this pandemic” and characterized Newsom’s leading Republican opponent as “another Trump climate denier.” The president’s two-day Western swing comes at a critical juncture for a central plank of his legislative agenda. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill are working to assemble details of the infrastructure-plus plan — and how to pay for it, a concern not just for Republicans. Besides unified Republican opposition in Congress, Biden needs to overcome the skepticism of two key centrist Democrats in the closely divided Senate. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona have expressed concerns about the size of the $3.5 trillion spending package. Manchin said Sunday, “I cannot support $3.5 trillion,” citing his opposition to a proposed increase in the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28% and vast new social spending envisioned by the president. Manchin also complained about a process he said feels rushed. In California, Biden appeared to respond to those concerned about the plan’s size, saying the cost “may be” as much as $3.5 trillion and would be spread out over 10 years, a period during which the economy is expected to grow. He also insisted that, when it comes to addressing climate change, “we have to think big.” “Thinking small is a prescription for disaster,” he said. The 100-member Senate is evenly split between Democrats and Republicans. Given solid GOP opposition, Biden’s plan cannot pass the Senate without Manchin’s or Sinema’s support. The White House is trying to turn the corner after a difficult month dominated by a chaotic and violent US withdrawal from Afghanistan and the surging delta Covid-19 variant that have upended what the president had hoped would mark a summer in which the nation was finally freed from the coronavirus. Biden acknowledged his polling numbers have dipped in recent weeks, but argued his agenda is “overwhelmingly popular” with the public. He said he expects his Republican opponents to attack him instead of debating him on the merits of his spending plan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-president-biden-turns-to-colorado-to-pitch-investments-in-clean-energy/articleshow/86214360.cms||---

"Why are you all pulling me over when there are brown people hurting white people," said Donald Craighead, 44, during his arrest on Monday morning, according to an affidavit submitted in court by a U.S. Capitol Police Officer. Prosecutors have charged Craighead, of Oceanside, California, with unlawfully possessing prohibited weapons, a felony. Around midnight Monday morning, a Capitol Police officer was on patrol when he noticed a pickup truck with a bayonet and a machete inside of it, and a swastika and other white supremacist symbols painted on it, the police department said in a news release. The truck was parked near the DNC headquarters, which borders the US Capitol complex, the statement said. Craighead said he was "on patrol" and began talking about white supremacist ideology, according to the affidavit. According to police, when asked why he had the weapons, Craighead stated: "I'm not much of an attacker. I'm build for defense. If I had to hurt someone I absolutely would." A judge on Tuesday ordered Craighead jailed until his next court date later this month. A Saturday rally is planned by supporters of the roughly 600 people charged with taking part in the deadly January 6 riot involving backers of then-President Donald Trump.

"We're encouraging everyone ... from the private and public sector to take actions to require vaccination," she said, when asked if the White House was encouraging states to enact their own vaccine mandates. President Joe Biden last week introduced a federal vaccine mandate aimed at employees of big companies and all federal workers and contractors. The mandate faces legal challenges. Previous vaccine mandates in the United States have mostly been introduced by state and local governments, and related to public spaces and schools. "Last week, as you know, we took big and strong actions as part of the tools that we have ... to boost vaccinations from the federal government," Jean-Pierre said. "We certainly advocate for local leaders to do the same," she said, calling the push to vaccinate Americans against the spread of the coronavirus "a wartime effort."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/white-house-encouraging-state-local-covid-19-vaccine-mandates/articleshow/86215775.cms||---

The government tabled the Karnataka Gram Swaraj and Panchayat Raj (Amendment) Bill-2021 in the assembly that seeks to transfer the power of setting up a delimitation commission to the government from the SEC. The move, according to sources, is an effort by the government to postpone the upcoming zilla and taluk panchayat elections. The delimitation of wards of zilla panchayats and taluk panchayats, which has already been done by the Election Commission, is challenged in the high court by several individuals. The government is likely to approach the high court with the amended Act and plead for permission to take up delimitation exercise afresh. The government also presented the Prisoners Identification (Karnataka Amendment) Bill, which allows authorities to collect blood, DNA, voice and retina samples of prisoners in the state. The bill, tabled by home minister Araga Jnanendra, will be taken up for passage before the ongoing session concludes on September 24. The bill, once passed, is expected to help government agencies keep tabs on repeat offenders and criminals. Supplementary estimatesThe government also presented the first instalment of supplementary estimates aggregating to Rs 10,265 crore for the current financial year. The highest allocation under the supplementary budget has been accorded to the RDPR department with Rs 2,858 crore, followed by Rs 1,700 crore to food and civil supplies department. Law and parliamentary affairs minister JC Madhuswamy tabled the bill to this effect on behalf of chief minister Basavaraj Bommai, who is also the finance minister. The bill is likely to be taken up for passage tomorrow or day after. The supplementary estimates are the expenditure incurred by the government over and above the budgetary provision in a current financial year. 10 bills presentedThe state government on Tuesday tabled 10 bills in total, which included Karnataka Prison Development Board Bill and Karnataka State Stamps (Amendment) Bill. The stamps amendment bill will give effect to the budget proposal of slashing the stamp duties on affordable housing priced up to Rs 45 lakh. The stamp duty has been proposed to be reduced from 5 per cent to 3 per cent.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/govt-tables-bill-to-take-away-secs-power-on-delimitation-of-wards/articleshow/86216035.cms||---

According to officials privy to the issue, the fund share could be 67 per cent for Ballari and the rest for Vijayanagara, largely, because assessment of ecological damage due to illegal mining indicated that it happened mostly in Sandur and Ballari taluks of Ballari district and not Hospet in Vijayanagara district. Anticipating trouble, chief minister Basavaraj Bommai pushed the division of funds till 2023-24. At a recent meeting of the Vijayanagara district formation, he said the current action plan under Karnataka Mining Environment Restoration Corporation (KMERC) and District Mineral Fund (DMF) will continue for the next two fiscals. The new fund share may boost development of Ballari, which lost tourism revenue accrued from Hampi to Vijayanagara. An official said: “As per a previous directive, the erstwhile district of Ballari was affected by mining. Accordingly, Vijayanagara will get a smaller portion of the fund.” Ballari has Rs 13,378 crore under KMERC which has 12 categories. As per the revised plan, Ballari will get Rs 8,968 crore and Vijayanagara Rs 4,415 crore. The government may divide DMF in the same ratio, with Ballari getting Rs 670 crore and Vijayanagara Rs 330 crore. Vijayanagara, banking on funds for development of Hospet, Kudligi and Hagribommanahalli taluks where mining caused significant ecological and social imbalance, may struggle financially under the new fund share regime. While Kudligi and Hagribommanahalli faced marginal impact, Hospet saw heavy damage as 80 per cent of iron ore drawn from Sandur went to a major steel manufacturer in the region. “Based on this assessment, we decided to give smaller share of the fund to Vijayanagara,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/ballari-dist-may-get-lions-share-of-mining-relief-fund/articleshow/86216037.cms||Sandeep Moudgal

The G-4 stage blocks, which are primarily ready for mineral exploration after preliminary assessment, will be up for grabs and the state government will have to auction them to generate revenue. The seven blocks of gold mining which have been identified are in Kakol and Sevanagar in Haveri district, Belaghatta and Katanahatti in Chitradurga district, Marutipur spread across Dharwad and Haveri districts, Kanivehalli located across Ballari and Davanagere districts and Mududi in Hassan district. According to GSI sources, the Union government has allowed conducting an auction of mining activities in 220 sqkm of the potential mineral area including gold and limestone under the new MMDR amendments. “The recent amendments to the MMDR are expected to increase employment, investment, production, and revenue in the mining sector in the state. The time-bound operationalisation of mines, maintaining continuity in mining operations after the change of lessee, and increasing the pace of exploration and auction of mineral sources is the key,” said Halappa Achar, minister for mines and geology. Ramesh Ballari, an entrepreneur, said there are no prominent industries in Haveri district and the allocation of two gold mining blocks of potential mineral dimensioned G-4 to the district will be crucial for its industrialisation.“We are expecting the new gold mining blocks to generate jobs for skilled workers,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/gold-exploration-to-resume-in-ktaka/articleshow/86216040.cms||Basavaraj Maralihalli

A consortium headed by Shapoorji Pallonji and Company Pvt Ltd is executing the project on contract in five phases. Replying to a question from the JD(S) MLA Manjunath R, the CM said all five phases will be taken up simultaneously and it should be completed before the end of the year. “We may even think of relooking at the contract if the works are not done properly,” he added. BBMP can impose a penalty of Rs 1 lakh a week on the contractor for the delay, he said. The project was approved in 2019 to replace 4.85 lakh streetlights with energy-efficient LEDs. The contract was handed to BSPL, the consortium of Shapoorji Pallonji, SMC Infrastructure and Samudra Electronics Systems to execute under public-private partnership. "LED lamps have been installed at some places, however the work has been delayed at some places for various reasons. I have instructed the officials to ensure all the lights are installed before December 31,” Bommai said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/cm-sets-dec-31-deadline-to-install-3-lakh-led-streetlights-in-bluru/articleshow/86216041.cms||---

---||World||Third shot: UK to offer Covid-19 booster jabs to over 50s||LONDON: The UK announced Tuesday it will offer a third dose of coronavirus vaccine to everyone over 50 and other vulnerable people to help the country ride out the pandemic through the winter months. The booster shots, which will be rolled out beginning next week, were approved a day after the Conservative government also backed plans to offer one vaccine dose to children 12 to 15 years old. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunization, which advises the government, recommended that booster shots be offered to everyone over 50, health care workers, people with underlying health conditions and those who live with people whose immune systems are compromised. They will be given no earlier than six months after a person received their second dose of vaccine. Around 30 million people will be eligible for the booster shots, which aim to protect against a modest waning in immunity among those who have received two jabs. “The result of this vaccination campaign is we have one of the most free societies and one of the most open economies in Europe,” British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told reporters on Tuesday. “That’s why we’re now sticking with our strategy.” Although the number of people now contracting COVID-19 is way higher than this time last year — over 30,000 new infections a day — the British government has opted not to re-introduce further virus restrictions for England, as the vaccine drive this year has reduced the number of people requiring treatment for COVID-19 and subsequently dying. However, Johnson said the government was ready to re-introduce measures over the coming weeks and months if the pressure on hospitals becomes acute. The number of people in UK hospitals with Covid-19 stands at around 8,500, way down from the near 40,000 that were hospitalized earlier this year during a catastrophic second wave of the pandemic. Measures held in reserve include mandatory mask-wearing, vaccine certifications for nightclubs and other large-scale events, though not pubs, and a requirement for people to work from home. “When you’ve got a large proportion, as we have now, with immunity, then smaller changes can make a bigger difference and give us the confidence that we don’t have to go back to the lockdowns of the past,” Johnson said. “In the meantime, we are confident in the vaccines that have made such a difference to our lives.” The JCVI said the Pfizer vaccine should be the primary choice for booster shots, with a half-dose of Moderna as an alternative. It said these messenger RNA vaccines are more effective as booster shots. The AstraZeneca vaccine shot, which is based on a different technology, will be offered to anyone who can’t receive an RNA vaccine for clinical reasons. The decision to offer booster shots is not one that’s being recommended by the World Health Organization, which has asked wealthy nations to delay giving them out until every country has vaccinated at least 40% of their people. Only a few other wealthy countries have recommended their use. In the United States, the FDA is publicly debating booster shots later this week. England’s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, said it’s hugely important that developing countries get the jabs they need but pointed to the difficulties in transporting the Pfizer vaccine, which has a relatively short shelf-life and needs to be kept at super-chilled temperatures. Appealing to everyone eligible for a vaccine to get one as soon as possible, Whitty said there is a “very substantially smaller” risk of being admitted to a hospital with Covid-19 if someone is vaccinated compared to those who are not. He said someone in their 30s who is unvaccinated is running the same level of risk as someone in their 70s who is vaccinated. “One of the most depressing things for doctors, including myself, is talking to people who have just chosen not to get vaccinated because it wasn’t convenient at that particular moment. And you see them being wheeled down to intensive care, and you know this was a very serious problem as a result of them not being vaccinated,” he said. Whitty also took aim at those who spread misinformation about the vaccines after being asked about comments from rapper Nicki Minaj, saying anyone “peddling untruths” to discourage others from getting the vaccine should be ashamed of themselves. On Monday, Minaj sent a series of sometime conflicting tweets to her more than 22 million followers, including an unsubstantiated story regarding her cousin’s friend being rendered impotent after being vaccinated. However, she also said that she was “sure” she would end up getting a shot in order to go on tour but wanted to do more research. When asked about the impotency remark, Whitty sought to stress that most people are ignoring baseless claims and are getting the vaccines — 81.2% of people 16 and older in Britain are fully vaccinated. “There are a number of myths that fly around, some of which are just clearly ridiculous and some of which are clearly designed just to scare,” Whitty said. “That happens to be one of them. That is untrue.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/third-shot-uk-to-offer-covid-19-booster-jabs-to-over-50s/articleshow/86216301.cms||---

Delhi's anti-terror unit chief, Pramod Kushwaha, told police had recovered IEDs containing RDX, grenades, Beretta pistols and ammunition, which had been stocked up for the attacks on large congregations during the upcoming festivals. One kg of RDX has been found till now. Dawood Ibrahim's brother Anees was directly coordinating execution of the plot and handling recruitment, finance, transport and other logistical aspects through his underworld channels. Read AlsoDelhi: On terror trail, sleuths focus on camp in PakistanThe investigation into the ISI terror module busted by the Intelligence Bureau and Delhi Police's Special Cell is now focused on the training camp in Thatta, Pakistan, which was earlier used by the Pakistan Special Service Group and the shadowy Inter-Services Intelligence to train Ajmal Kasab for Two of the arrested men — Mohammad Osama from Delhi and Zeeshan from Prayagraj — were trained by the ISI and Pak military at Gioni in the Gwadar port area. Ibrahim’s henchmen first got them to Muscat and then took them to Pakistan via the sea route. They came under the scanner of agencies during this time. The module had got multiple IEDs arranged from sources across the border and were at an advanced stage of execution when the agencies swooped down on them, thereby saving scores of lives. The first to be arrested was the chief handler and D Company henchman, Jaan Mohammed Sheikh alias Sameer Kaliya (47), a resident of Social Nagar, Mumbai. Read AlsoISI terror module: D Company’s role back under lensThe operation against a terror module brings in the limelight the enhanced and renewed role of Dawood Ibrahim's so-called D Company in destabilising India and shows how Pakistan’s ISI is engaging with Ibrahim in lieu of the safe haven provided to the underworld don’s syndicate.He was nabbed from a running train in Kota, Rajasthan, while he was on his way to Delhi. He led the teams to Mohammad Osama (22) alias Sami, a resident of Abu Fazal Enclave in Jamia Nagar area of Delhi. Simultaneously, cops picked up another D Company associate and hawala dealer Moolchand (47), a resident of Rae Bareilly in UP. Raids continued with the arrest of Zeeshan Qamar from Prayagraj and Mohammad Amir Javed from Lucknow. Mohammed Abu Bakar (23), a resident of Bahraich, was arrested from Sarai Kale Khan in Delhi. Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana reviewed the operation on Tuesday noon. The operation was conducted by a crack team led by ACP Lalit Mohan Negi and Hriday Bhushan. The raids and arrests were made by teams comprising inspectors Sunil Rajain, Ravinder Joshi and Vinay Pal. According to the police, the arrested persons were tasked separately to execute different aspects of the terror plan. "The underworld operative, Sameer, a close contact of Anees Ibrahim, was tasked by a Pak-based person connected with underworld operatives hiding in Pakistan to ensure smooth delivery of IEDs, sophisticated weapons and grenades to different entities in India," DCP Kushwaha said. Osama and Zeeshan, who are Pakistan-trained terror operatives working under the instructions of ISI, were given the responsibility of conducting reconnaissance of suitable locations in Delhi and UP and place the IEDs, he added.  "The special cell of Delhi Police had received a reliable input from a central agency that a Pak-abetted and sponsored group of entities was planning to execute serial IED blasts in India. For this, the group has got multiple IEDs arranged from sources across the border and were at an advanced stage of preparation," DCP Kushwaha said in a statement. Their inputs, said cops, indicated that an Okhla-based entity was an important part of this module who had associates based in various parts of the country, including Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra. "A multi-pronged operation was launched to unearth the whole conspiracy and several teams were stationed at Mumbai, Lucknow, Prayagraj, Rae Bareilly and Pratapgarh in UP simultaneously. On September 14, 2021, on the basis of intelligence gathered through human as well as technical nodes, simultaneous raids were conducted in different states. The operation in UP was done in coordination with the UP ATS," said Kushwaha. The interrogation of suspects has revealed that this module had received sophisticated RDX based IEDs, grenades, pistols and cartridges from a sleeper cell operative and these were sent to UP for safe concealment. Thereafter, underworld operative Jan Mohd Sheikh was tasked by Pak-based Anees Ibrahim to receive them in Delhi and hand over to other terror operatives in Delhi, Mumbai and other parts of the country. "Subsequently, further deliveries of similar consignments of IEDs were to be done through the same channel," the DCP said. The suspects are being interrogated about the other consignments and the identity and locations of other members of their syndicate.

---||Bengaluru||Only 0.3% of 35 lakh children screened had Covid in Karnataka||BENGALURU: As part of its strategy to face a possible third wave, the Karnataka government has been screening children in the 0-19 age group since mid-August and found that just 0.3% of the 35 lakh tested so far have had Covid. With the overall fresh Covid-19 cases in Karnataka declining, the government’s focus has shifted to the 1.5 crore paediatric population. Health commissioner Dr KV Trilok Chandra said the screening of paediatric population will be completed in the next two months. The screening is being done under the Arogya Nandana scheme launched in mid-August. The scheme will also look for markers that indicate nutritional levels in children and aims to improve their immunity. While those children with ILI/SARI and other Covid-like symptoms will be flagged off immediately, the health department will prepare reports of the findings based on which action will be initiated. The government had screened 2.5 lakh people by the end of August and covered 32.5 lakh in the first two weeks of September at the rate of 2.5 lakh people a day. Separate data from Covid-19 war room shows as of September 12, over 3.2 lakh people in this age group have had the infection and 157 -- or 0.04% of them -- have succumbed to Covid-19. Comparatively, as of August 31, there were 3.1 lakh cases and 155 deaths. Data shows that of the over 29 lakh cases, the highest number of infections (nearly 6.8 lakh) have been reported among those in the 30-39 age group. This is followed by more than 6.3 lakh infections in the 20-29 age group and nearly 5.2 lakh cases in the 40-49 years group. There are only 226 cases among those aged above 100, while more than 4,549 cases have been reported in the 90-99 years category. When it comes to deaths, the highest number of deaths (nearly 11,000) have been reported in the 60-69 age group, followed by more than 8,000 in the 50-59 years category.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/only-0-3-of-35-lakh-children-screened-had-covid-in-ktaka/articleshow/86216656.cms||Chethan Kumar
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Another MBBS aspirant in Ariyalur ends life a day after NEET||ARIYALUR: An MBBS aspirant in Ariyalur district, who appeared for the national eligibility cum entrance test (NEET) on Sunday, was found hanging at her house late on Monday. The deceased has been identified as K Kanimozhi, 17. The girl’s father Karunanidhi is a lawyer practising in Jayankondam court. Kanimozhi allegedly ended her life at her house at Thularankurichi near Udayarpalayam over fear of failure in the test, when her parents were attending a function at Ariyalur. Her elder sister is a student at a private college in Perambalur. Her family took her body to their native at Sathambadi in Ariyalur district, where her final rites were conducted in the evening. Sathambadi panchayat president Thanga Ravichandran said that the girl was a student of a private school at Namakkal and had scored 562 out of 600 in Class XII board examinations. Her score in Class X was 469 out of 500. She appeared sad after appearing for NEET at a centre in Thanjavur as she had apprehension that she may not clear NEET. Udayarpalayam police took up the investigation. It is the second such suicide in the state in the last two days. Dhanush, 19, of Mettur in Salem district had ended his life before appearing for NEET. Chief minister M K Stalin expressed shock over the death of Kanimozhi and he sought to drive away NEET through legal means. “I assure the students and their parents that there will be no compromise on abolishing NEET with the consent of the president of India,” said the CM. The chief minister also said that impersonation, question paper leak and malpractices at the coaching centres proved that NEET is not an exam that weighs the eligibility of the students. Registering his condolence, former chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami asked the DMK to put an end to the ‘political drama’ over NEET and explain the reality to the students. The former CM also demanded the state government to provide counselling for the MBBS aspirants after appearing for NEET. Former chief minister O Panneerselvam said that it was disheartening that the students were taking such extreme steps, while all political parties in the state were raising pitch against the NEET. Calling it an unfortunate event, which should not happen to any student in future, TMC president G K Vasan MP said that political parties should not give any false hope to the students and their parents by politicising education. MDMK general secretary Vaiko demanded the central government to give consent to the anti-NEET bill tabled by the DMK government. “NEET imposed by the BJP cost the lives of 15 students in Tamil Nadu. The Constitution of India has vested the state government with the power of enacting a law over education in the concurrent list for protecting the interest of the state,” said Vaiko.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/another-mbbs-aspirant-ends-life-a-day-after-neet/articleshow/86213017.cms||---

J Nithyasree of Srirangam secured first rank while Sarathivasan ranked eigth. Different rankings were awarded based on various factors including maths and physics scores and date of birth. Sarathivasan of Thuvakudi Malai in Trichy completed Class VII at Boiler Plant Higher Secondary School, a government-aided school, and then to Bengaluru. Sarathivasan said he plans to pursue engineering at the main campus of Anna University in Guindy, Chennai. “I am thinking of opting for BE computer science or B Tech Information Technology. I wish to become a software developer.” The cut-offs for engineering admissions are likely to go up by 2 marks to 70 marks, with more than one lakh students securing 150 and above. Experts said it will be extremely tough for students to give preferences of choices due to such a huge variation compared to the previous year. Higher education minister K Ponmudi told reporters 1,51,870 seats would be available in 440 colleges. The number of students in the counselling process increased by 26,627 over the previous year, with 21 colleges opting out. Last year, 461 colleges took part. Career consultant Jayaprakash Gandhi said awarding marks without exams has made the admissions process challenging. “Choice filling for these students will be very tough,” he said. One lakh students scoring above 150 cut-off marks is unprecedented and TNEA may have to add at least two more rounds of counselling. Earlier, Ponmudi said TNEA would conduct five rounds of counselling to fill seats falling vacant after medical counselling. “Last year, around 700 fell vacant on Anna University’s four campuses,” he said As many as 15,660 students from government schools applied for counselling. “As per the 7.5% reservation, 11,390 seats are reserved for government school students. Chief minister M K Stalin will give allotment letters to top 10 candidates from government schools at Anna University on September 18.” Counselling for special categories will be from September 15 to 24 and online counselling from September 27 to October 17.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-loadmans-son-among-13-with-200-in-engg-list/articleshow/86213116.cms||---
---||Chennai||RS poll in Tamil Nadu: DMK fields Kanimozhi NVN Somu and KRN Rajeshkumar||CHENNAI: The ruling DMK on Tuesday named Kanimozhi NVN Somu and KRN Rajeshkumar as its candidates for the two vacant Rajya Sabha seats from Tamil Nadu. The Election Commission of India (ECI) had last week announced the schedule for the two “casual” vacancies in Rajya Sabha and the election will be held on October 4, 2021. The two seats fell vacant following the resignations of two AIADMK members - R Vaithilingam and K P Munusamy. The senior AIADMK leaders, who are also the party’s deputy coordinators, had resigned on May 7, after getting elected to the Tamil Nadu assembly in the recent elections held on April 6. The names of the two DMK candidates were announced by party president M K Stalin in a statement. Stalin’s statement, however, did not specify who between the two will serve the residual term of Vaithilingam that was to end in June, 2022. Munusamy’s term was to end in April, 2026. Kanimozhi Somu, a doctor by profession, is the daughter of late Union minister and former DMK Lok Sabha MP from North Chennai NVN Somu. She is the party’s medical wing secretary. Kanimozhi had earlier unsuccessfully contested as DMK candidate from T Nagar in the 2016 assembly election. Rajeshkumar is DMK in-charge for the party’s Namakkal east district. With the ruling DMK having a majority of its own with 125 members and along with the allies commanding a support of 159 members in the 234-member state assembly, the victory of the two DMK Rajya Sabha candidates is a foregone conclusion. The AIADMK and its allies have 75 members in the house. “The AIADMK is unlikely to field any candidate for the Rajya Sabha bypoll. Even if it ventures to do so, our party’s both the candidates will emerge successful,” senior DMK leader and party Rajya Sabha member R S Bharathi said close on the heels of the ECI announcing the election schedule. By naming the candidates for both the seats, Stalin has put to rest the aspirations of the allies, especially the Congress, from seeking one of the two Rajya Sabha seats. DMK had reportedly promised a Rajya Sabha seat to the Congress, while pressurising the national party to settle for lower number of seats in the alliance for the assembly elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/rs-poll-dmk-fields-kanimozhi-somu-and-rajeshkumar/articleshow/86212962.cms||D Govardan
---||India||SC: Won’t reopen settled issues on promotion quota||NEW DELHI: Dealing with a bunch of petitions raising the contentious issue of reservation in promotion, the Supreme Court on Tuesday said it would not reopen norms settled in its earlier judgments that had ordered exclusion of the creamy layer, quantifiable data on adequacy of representation of backward classes in government posts and safeguarding administrative efficiency. This clarification came repeatedly from a bench of Justices L N Rao, Saniv Khanna and B R Gavai while taking up 132 petitions, which challenged various state legislations attempting to brush aside the mandate of three constitutional bench judgments - Indra Sawhney (which in 1992 stipulated exclusion of the creamy layer to OBCs and capped quota at 50%), M Nagaraj (which in 2006 called for quantifiable data to justify the extent of reservation in promotion with a mandate that quota must not dilute administrative efficiency) and Jarnail Singh (which in 2018 ruled out reconsideration of Nagraj and extended creamy layer exclusion for SC/ST employees in promotion). In 2019, in Pavitra-II judgment, the SC had diluted the settled concepts. In Pavitra-I judgment, the SC had quashed a Karnataka law providing consequential seniority along with reservations in promotions as unconstitutional on the ground of absence of quantifiable data criteria, which was held mandatory by both Nagaraj and Jarnail Singh judgments. However, in Pavitra-II, the SC diluted the consistently insisted upon norm of quantifiable data on adequacy of representation by allowing the criteria to be fulfilled merely by a state saying that in its opinion there was inadequate representation to continue with reservation in promotion. In the Nagaraj case, the SC had ruled that "the state is not bound to make reservation for SC/ST in matters of promotions. However, if they wish to exercise their discretion and make such provision, the state has to collect quantifiable data showing backwardness of the class and inadequacy of representation of that class in public employment in addition to compliance of Article 335 (administrative efficiency)". At the outset, Justice Rao-led bench said, "We are making it very clear that we are not going to reopen Nagaraj, Jarnail Singh or any other judgment. Because the idea is to decide these petitions in accordance with the law already laid down by this court. We will proceed to hear the petitions on this basis." Attorney General K K Venugopal said he fully agreed with the court and that nearly all these issues are covered by the judgments of the SC, including the recent Pavitra case judgment. "I will give a total background of reservation from its inception until the last judgment and the court will find that nearly every issue is already covered. Only Tripura has a peculiar case. Otherwise, there is no scope for reopening any of the judgments," he said. The bench is hearing a clutch of petitions challenging 11 judgments of various HCs, which had either quashed or upheld state legislations on quota in promotion in reservation for being allegedly in contravention of the SC judgments The bench said the AG would give a background note on the issues raised in these petitions and how they were covered by various judgments. "Let the AG flag the issues and tell us about the judgments. But we are very clear that we are not going to permit any argument for reopening of cases or allow anyone to argue that the law laid down right from Indra Sawhney till Pavitra is wrong. Very scope of these petitions is to apply the law laid down by this court with the facts emerging from each state. We will proceed only on that basis."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sc-wont-reopen-settled-issues-on-promotion-quota/articleshow/86217087.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||Madurai||Pay traffic fines using e-wallet in Madurai||MADURAI: To simplify payment of fines for traffic violations through the e-challan system, the Madurai city police have included digital wallets and internet banking payment methods. Apart from this, anyone can settle pending fines of previous cases booked anywhere in the state using these payment methods. City police commissioner Prem Anand Sinha said that a proposal was made after analysing that realisation of fines was much lower considering the number of cases that were booked. “We found that only around 40% of fines were being collected through the e-challan system by payment through cards or e-service centres. As digital wallets and internet banking have become commonly available among the public, it would be easier for people to pay the fines quickly if these payment methods are available,” he said. Previously, through the e-challan system, payment of fines could only be done on the spot on the e-challan machine by use of debit or credit card or at a government e-service centre. “We cannot force them to pay. Most violators of traffic rules either say that they don’t have a credit or debit cards with them or they have low balance. They are also not keen to pay through e-service centres,” said a traffic police official. At e-service centres, a commission has to be paid which makes it even more burden for the people. Since last week, the city traffic police have gradually started accepting payment through various digital wallets such as Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm and internet banking from traffic violators. “Additionally, through the e-challan machine, we can pull up any pending fine amounts of previous cases booked in any district in Tamil Nadu and the violators can make payment for it too in a swift manner without any difficulty,” said Sinha. The commissioner also added that efforts are being made to create more awareness among the public of availability of these new modes of payment through social media and also by pasting posters/stickers on traffic police booths.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/pay-traffic-fines-using-e-wallet-in-madurai/articleshow/86211284.cms||---
---||Business||Reinvent workplace to make staff feel safe, empowered||By Srikanth KarraWe have come to witness over time that sustained periods of uncertainty and apprehension are known to alter human psychology and behaviour. The pandemic is unravelling such changes at a global scale. Perhaps, pandemic mitigation itself requires mass coordinated behavioural change to succeed. Now, how business and employers incorporate and embrace these changes will make or break an organisation in a ‘post-pandemic’, ‘future-ready’ world. From leading to new ways to foster workplace culture virtually and upholding employee morale during unprecedented times, Covid has proven the resiliency of community and human connection in spite of physical distance. People are understandably eager and ready to be together again to regain a sense of normalcy. The requisites of business continuity through the pandemic made it incumbent upon employers and organisations to re-invent and re-shape the workplace to make workers feel comfortable, supported and empowered to do their jobs effectively. In a post-pandemic setup, how one designs a workplace that responds not just to the fears and anxiety of the workforce but also integrates the full range of newly learned behaviours and attitudes that have evolved through the Covid crisis is what will set a business ahead of the curve. We are observing a new set of traits emerging across the workforce and these will surely shape a future-ready workplace… Hyper-personalisation of talent management: This is the key focus for organisations today. With a new flexibility required for a workforce joining forces remotely across the world, Corporations cannot adopt a one-size-fits-most programme for employee well-being anymore. There is a greater appreciation now for benefits and allowances centred on personalisation to employee productivity, wellness and engagement. Emotionally empowering workplace: To navigate through these challenging times, Leaders need to accelerate and create positivity among people. Management has to be comprehensible on strategic plans and priorities for the workplace and what they want to accomplish. Leaders must listen to employees at all levels, evaluate best practices, and dispense a clear direction, which should be articulated both internally and externally. Agile work culture with integrated flexibility: People no longer view flexibility as an amenity, but as a must-have in their jobs and, in future, employers must have a range of options for integrating flexibility for the benefit of their employees. Workplace design needs to provide supportive features to reinforce a sense of safety and empower employees to make good decisions for their personal needs. Upskilling for the highly digital landscape: Over time, we have come to understand that people are learning and skilling & upskilling at an unparalleled rate because the productive time they now have at their disposal has quite literally quadrupled. For the post-pandemic workforce, skilling has become a priority. Organisations, now more than ever, need to foresee the right skills for the future, build a cultural foundation, construct modern upskilling programmes, and nurture a cohesive learning and development function for their agile workforce. Employee wellness & accelerated focus on fitness: There’s been a lot of self-awareness and introspection among the workforce as Covid got people thinking. Mental health programmes are seeing a rapid increase in adoption and investment. Considering employers’ heightened awareness of health concerns, telemedicine programmes are experiencing one of the most significant increases in popularity out of all wellness benefits. Providing an outlet for employees to continue with their physical wellness will unquestionably have an overall positive impact on other wellness dimensions. While there is no silver-bullet solution for a perfect working environment, the current crisis has unravelled opportunities to reshape the workplace and create spaces that are meaningfully centred on the human experience. Tailoring workplaces for the post-Covid mindset will tackle the challenges we face now and create more resiliency for businesses in the future.

Additionally, a fund managed by Bank of America bought nearly 49 lakh on the same day. As a result of these two large deals, the stock of the company rallied 45% in Tuesday’s session and closed with a 40% gain at Rs 262 on the BSE. Across the two exchanges, nearly 22 crore Zee shares changed hands, data from both the NSE and the BSE showed. On Monday, Zee disclosed that two foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) — Invesco Oppenheimer Developing Markets Fund and OFI Global China Fund, which together hold nearly 18% in the company — had asked for an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) to oust three of its directors, including Punit Goenka, its MD & CEO. The same day, two of its directors — Ashok Kurien and Manish Chokhani — resigned. Goenka still continues, and attended the company’s AGM on Tuesday evening. The two funds also want to put in six of their nominees as directors on Zee’s board. Zee chairman R Gopalan made no mention of Invesco’s move to rejig the media company’s board at the AGM. While a couple of shareholders mentioned Invesco’s move at the meeting, the company’s board, however, remained silent. “Invesco seems to be having problems with the company. But it is not sharing its issues with other shareholders. Why should we vote in favour of its proposals?” asked shareholder Aspi Besania. Another shareholder Krishnan from Chennai said that the developments over the last 24 hours are telling on the Zee stock. Market has welcomed the move, he said. Some shareholders said they supported Zee’s current leadership under Goenka. Goenka’s father and chairman emeritus of Zee, Subhash Chandra, also attended the AGM. Chandra currently owns just 4% in Zee. The business man lost majority control of Zee due to financial troubles. He had to sell a significant chunk of his stake in Zee to pay off debts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/jhunjhunwala-buys-rs-110cr-zee-shares-stock-up-40/articleshow/86215019.cms||---

They wanted to showcase the importance of the day and raise awareness about the use of the national language. Speaking as the chief guest of a function organized by the Hindi department of Patna University (PU), noted littérateur, Bhupinder Kalsi, pointed out that Hindi should be made a medium of science education so that it gets wider acceptance. “A lot of job opportunities have come up for Hindi linguists in recent years. If necessary steps are taken for promoting its use in higher education in science and technology, it will certainly develop as a global language,” Kalsi said, adding that Hindi was the fourth most-spoken language in the world after English, Spanish, and Mandarin. PU’s geology department, on the other hand, organized a speech contest on ‘Contribution of Hindi Language in the Development of the Nation’ in which Mohd Asad Rahman, Shafquat Arfa, Avinash Upadhaya, and Anil Kumar received prizes. The head of the geology department, Atul Aditya Pandey, in his presidential remarks, recalled that Hindi was adopted as one of the official languages of India on September 14, 1949.

---||Patna||LJP MP Prince booked on rape charges||PATNA/SAMASTIPUR: LJP MP from Samastipur, Prince Raj, has been booked on the charges of rape, criminal conspiracy and destruction of evidence. An FIR was lodged against him with Delhi's Connaught Place police station on the directions of a local court on September 9 after three months of a complaint submitted to the police by the victim. The FIR also mentions the name of Prince’s cousin and Jamui MP Chirag Paswan. Chirag has been booked for hatching a conspiracy to delay action against his cousin. The FIR has been lodged under Sections 376, 376 (2) (k), 201 and 120 of IPC by a former party functionary. Advocate Sudesh Kumari Jethwa, appearing for the complainant, said, “We had lodged a complaint with the Delhi police in July. But the FIR was registered against the accused after the court directed the police to do so.” On June 17, Prince, through a tweet, had denied the allegation. “I categorically deny any such claim or assertion that has been made against me. All such claims are blatantly false, fabricated, and part of a larger criminal conspiracy to pressurise me professionally and personally by threatening my reputation,” he had tweeted. The woman alleged that she had met Prince several times and in one such meeting, she picked up a water bottle from the table, but the MP said he would give her another bottle from inside. “After consuming it, I fell unconscious. When I regained consciousness, I found my head on his shoulder. He told me I was unwell and then I returned home. Later, he showed me a video recorded by him. He was making physical relations with me but my face was not visible in the video,” she alleged in her complaint. The complainant claimed that Prince proposed to marry her or he would put the video online. “I was scared and then he started visiting my house at odd hours for a physical relationship. I informed the (then) party chief Chirag Paswan about it,” she said. On January 15, the complainant said she went to see Chirag and after all discussions, he pressurised me not to file the case against Prince as he was ready to resolve the matter. “I left the party in February and when Prince came to know about the matter, he lodged an FIR against me,” she alleged. On February 10, Prince lodged an FIR against the woman and her fiancée with the Delhi Parliament Street police station, alleging that he was being pressurised to pay Rs1 crore. The woman and her fiancée were booked under sections 384 extortion and 389 of IPC. Meanwhile, LJP state chief (Chirag faction) Raju Tiwari said the Jamui MP has been falsely implicated in the case. Prince is among the five MPs, who rebelled against Chirag and sided with his uncle Pashupati Kumar Paras, who is now a Union minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ljp-mp-prince-booked-on-rape-charges/articleshow/86208643.cms||Ramashankar
---||Amaravati||Andhra Pradesh meets first quarter capex target, gets Centre’s nod for additional borrowing||AMARAVATI: In a big relief to the cash-strapped state government, the Centre has permitted Andhra Pradesh to go for additional borrowing to the tune of Rs 2,655 crore thanks to its performance in meeting the capital expenditure target. AP is one of 11 states to have achieved the target set by the Union finance ministry for capital expenditure in the first quarter of 2021-22 and has got an incentive to borrow an additional amount. The additional open market borrowing permission granted is equivalent to 0.25% of the gross state domestic product (GSDP). Additional financial resources thus made available will help the states in pushing their capital expenditure further. AP has been allowed to borrow an amount of Rs 2,655 crore during the current fiscal. Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand are the other states that have met the capital expenditure target. All the 11 states together were allowed to borrow an additional amount of Rs 15,721 crore. Capital expenditure has a high multiplier effect, enhances the future productive capacity of the economy, and results in a higher rate of economic growth. Accordingly, out of the net borrowing ceiling (NBC) of 4% of GSDP for the states for 2021-22, 0.50% of GSDP was earmarked for incremental capital expenditure to be incurred by the states during 2021-22. The target for incremental capital expenditure for each state to qualify for the incremental borrowing was fixed by the department of expenditure. To become eligible for incremental borrowing, the states were required to achieve at least 15% of the target for 2021-22 by the end of the first quarter of 2021-22, 45% by the end of second quarter, 70% by the end of third quarter and 100% by March 31, 2022. The next review of capital expenditure of states will be in December 2021. The capital expenditure achieved by the states till September 30 will be assessed in the next round. The third review will be done in March 2022. The capital expenditure-linked borrowing ceiling of 0.50% of GSDP will be allowed to those states that will achieve actual capital expenditure of at least 45% of the target by September 30, 2021 or 70% of the target by December 31, 2021. There would be a final review of capital expenditure by the states in June 2022. Any shortfall in comparison with the targeted capital expenditurewill be adjusted from the borrowing ceiling of the state for 2022-23.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/ap-meets-first-quarter-capex-target-gets-centres-nod-for-additional-borrowing/articleshow/86210224.cms||Samdani MN
---||Patna||Assess crop damage due to rain too: Bihar agriculture minister||PATNA: Taking a departure from the past practices, the agriculture department has asked the DMs of the 28 flood-prone districts to assess the crop damage suffered by the farmers both due to rainfall and floods. Agriculture minister Amarendra Pratap Singh told mediapersons on Tuesday that the fresh assessment was ordered on the direction of CM Nitish Kumar. The state began to witness heavy rain from the last week of May even before the formal start of the monsoon around June 12. Several plots of land were flooded by rainwater and no paddy plantation could be done in those plots. The agriculture department has put a condition that such waterlogged plots of land which could not have kharif cropping this year had to have the record of cropping done in the last three years. Further, with the formal onset of monsoon, floodwaters began damaging cropped land. Kharif crops like paddy and pulses were damaged by the floodwaters. However, this year, the assessment of the damage caused to the standing sugar cane plantation will also be done for compensation to the farmers, like in the case of paddy and other kharif crops. The major sugar cane growing districts are West Champaran, East Champaran and Sitamarhi. Incidentally, the September rain is considered useful for paddy. The farmers only want that there should not be accumulation of excess water in the paddy fields.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/assess-crop-damage-due-to-rain-too-bihar-agriculture-minister/articleshow/86208875.cms||Abhay Singh

According to a rough estimate, more than 7,000 tonnes of municipal wastes have accumulated in various localities of the city, such as Gandhi Maidan, Boring Road, Bailey Road, Dak Bangalow, Fraser Road, Langar Toli, Ashok Rajpath, Mithapur and Station Road. Heavy rain over the last two days has added to the woes of the people. Arpana Singh, a resident of Patliputra Colony, said, “The situation is deteriorating day by day because of intermittent rain. The city has turned into a slum. The government should act as soon as possible.” Since monsoon-related diseases are on the rise in the city, people are more concerned. Megha Singh, a resident of Boring Road, said, “It has become unbearable now. People just can’t live under these circumstances. We have no other option but to dump garbage in an empty plot.” PMC commissioner Himanshu Sharma, however, said 90% sanitary inspectors have already returned to work. “Daily wage and contractual workers have also been given an ultimatum to return to work,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/heaps-of-garbage-give-rise-to-viral-fever-cases/articleshow/86208405.cms||---

Among them, 113 were admitted to different hospitals and the rest prescribed medicines. At least 6,800 such cases have so far been reported this month at different government hospitals in the state and 14 children have died. Additional chief secretary of health department, Sanjay Kumar Singh, said these data were provided by different government hospitals, including district and sub-divisional hospitals. Private hospitals in the state have also been treating many children suffering from viral fever. Singh said most children return home after check-up in the OPD and take prescribed medicines at home. “Some children recover in five to six days after proper medication. They don’t need hospitalisation. None of the children visiting the OPDs of government hospital with complaint of viral fever has so far been tested positive for Covid-19,” Singh said. He cited humid weather as one of the reasons for viral fever among children along with receding floodwaters. “This happens every year. Hence, parents should not panic,” Singh added. Former head of Patna Medical College and Hospital paediatrics department Dr Nigam Prakash Narain said parents should follow Covid-appropriate behaviour to protect their children from viruses. “Infected people should keep away from children,” Dr Narain said, adding such viral cases happen every year, though it has happened a little early this year. “These cases have nothing to do with Covid-19. However, people should keep their surroundings clean,” Dr Narain said. Muzaffarpur-based paediatrician Dr Arun Shah has also advised parents to follow all safety protocols and encourage their children to maintain hand hygiene. “Most children suffering from viral fever respond well to medicines. Some even don’t need to visit the doctor. However, parents should monitor their kids. In case of loss of appetite and breathing problem, one should visit the nearest paediatrician without delay. In case of persistent high fever too, doctors should be consulted,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/viral-fever-113-kids-admitted-to-bihars-govt-hospitals-in-24-hours/articleshow/86208374.cms||Sheezan Nezami

The first incident was reported on Sunday in jail number 3. According to a jail official, an inmate, identified as Vikas Dhull, facing a case of cheating, was attacked by Vikas Chopra with a surgical blade. “Chopra was involved in cases of robbery, snatching and Arms Act. Dhull suffered an injury on his face and was taken to the hospital,” the official said. Investigators said it seemed to be a targeted attack to scare Dhull. “Further investigations are on,” an official said. In the second incident, a 28-year-old undertrial was attacked by another inmate on Monday. Police were informed by DDU Hospital that Vijay, an inmate of jail number 3, was admitted after he was stabbed with a sharp metal piece during a scuffle at Tihar. The doctor told police, “The patient received two injuries on the hip.” Further investigations revealed that around 10 am on Monday, Jonny, another inmate, assaulted Vijay. A case under IPC Section 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means) was registered at Hari Nagar police station and it was found that personal enmity had led to the scuffle. According to an official, 25 inmates were injured 10 days ago, but these were self-inflicted minor injuries. “To put pressure on the authority, some inmates created trouble and caused self-inflicted injuries,” the official said. Last Saturday, two inmates were injured during a clash inside the prison. Police have registered a case and claimed that the incident was part of a gang war. In August, a 29-year-old gangster, Ankit Gujjar, was found dead inside Tihar and a deputy superintendent of jail number 3 has been booked for the alleged murder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/two-inmates-injured-after-assault-inside-tihar-in-separate-incidents/articleshow/86213976.cms||---

The chargesheet does not speak about how and from where now-dismissed assistant inspector Sachin Waze, a key conspirator, procured gelatin. It states that two days prior to Hiran’s murder, Waze handed over a bag containing huge cash to encounter specialist Pradeep Sharma, who in turn paid Hiran's killers, but the source of the money is not clear. Read AlsoSachin Waze planned to extort money from Mukesh Ambani: NIADismissed police officer Sachin Waze, the mastermind behind the planting of explosives in a vehicle near Mukesh Ambani’s residence on February 25, had planned to extort money from the industrialist, according to the chargesheet submitted by the National Investigation Agency (NIA).Further, referring to the threat post that appeared on Telegram channel named “Jaish Ul Hind” claiming responsibility for placing the explosives-laden vehicle, the chargesheet talks about two motives: Waze wanted to regain his clout as ace detective/encounter specialist and hence conspired with others to place the explosives-laden vehicle and a threat note to Ambani, and about the second one, the chargesheet states, “Herein demand for ransom is made from Ambani family to avoid dire consequences which clearly depicts the motive of Waze for huge monetary gains from the entire conspiracy.” The NIA suspects that former city police commissioner Param Bir Singh’s email ID was used to create the FaceTime ID, which allegedly was used to talk to other accused. The NIA is probing the matter and has written to the phone manufacturer to provide details of the FaceTime ID it has found.

However in the NIA chargesheet, there is no mention of this.  Aurangabad resident Vijay Nade had lodged a complaint of car theft though the number plate of his car was recovered along with several electronic devices such as laptop, DVR, mobile phones, hard drive and fake number plates of vehicles from the Mithi river. The stuff was apparently dumped there at the behest of Waze and his subordinate Riyazuddin Kazi. NIA officials said their investigations are still underway, and some more persons likely to be arrested, and the supplementary chargesheet will have further information. NIA had on September 3 submitted the chargesheet before the court presided by special judge Prashant R Sitre against 10 accused, including Waze, retired encounter specialist Pradeep Sharma and inspector Sunil Mane. It was filed two days before the stipulated period of 180 days under UAPA would end.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-chargesheet-silent-on-where-waze-got-gelatin-sticks-from/articleshow/86215914.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Business||UPI to be linked to PayNow of S’pore by July next year||Mayur.Shetty@timesgroup.com Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) have announced a project to link their respective fast payment systems — Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and PayNow. The central banks have set July 2022 as the target to operationalise the link. Connecting UPI to PayNow will allow users of each of the two fast payment systems to make instant, low-cost fund transfers on a reciprocal basis without a need to get onboarded onto a third-party system. The RBI said that the UPI-PayNow linkage is a significant milestone in the development of infrastructure for cross-border payments between India and Singapore. It added that the move closely aligns with the G20’s financial inclusion priorities of driving faster, cheaper and more transparent cross-border payments. NPCI International and Network for Electronic Transfers (NETS) have already been working to foster cross-border interoperability of payments between India and Singapore using cards and QR codes. The agreement between the two central banks will further anchor trade, travel and remittance flow between the two countries. According to Bloomberg, cross-border flows between India and Singapore add up to over $1 billion annually. PayNow is the fast payment system of Singapore that enables a peer-to-peer funds transfer service, available to retail customers through participating banks and non-bank financial institutions (NFIs) in Singapore. It enables users to send and receive instant funds from one bank or e-wallet account to another in Singapore by using just their mobile number, Singapore NRIC/FIN, or VPA. “By reducing the cost and inefficiencies of remittances between Singapore and India, the PayNow-UPI linkage will directly benefit individuals and businesses in Singapore and India that greatly rely on this mode of payment,” said MAS chief fintech officer Sopnendu Mohanty. The announcement comes a day after NPCI International announced a deal with the Liquid Group to bring UPI payments to 10 more Asian countries. Earlier, NPCI International had tied up with Mashreq Bank to enable UPI acceptance in the Middle East. Bhutan was the first neighbourhood country to enable UPI acceptance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/upi-to-be-linked-to-paynow-of-spore-by-july-next-year/articleshow/86213581.cms||Mayur Shetty

Calendar year 2021 has seen nine venture capital deals valued over $18 million in the non-academics edtech space compared to just two such deals of around $4 million in 2019, data from Venture Intelligence shows. Leading academics-oriented edtech firms such as Vedantu and White Hat Jr (Byju’s) have also recently launched extracurriculars on their platforms to cement their position as a one-stop learning source. From music to dance to arts & crafts, yoga, and other hobbies, kids can now pursue their passion from homes and founders say nuclear families and increased comfort with all-things digital makes the model sustainable in a Covid-free world. Investors are also all in as the model plays into every parent's key goal- well-rounded education of their kids. A top deal in this segment includes children’s extracurricular platform Yellow Class raising $6 million in series A led by Elevation Capital with participation from India Quotient and others. Founders Anshul Gupta and Arpit Mittal say parents world over are looking for better cognitive growth-oriented alternatives to YouTube and other platforms that kids consume passively. “We have kids from over 500 cities in India - from remote villages to metropolitan cities. There are several operational and economic reasons because of which kids cannot explore and learn new hobbies offline,” they added. Akshay Bhushan, partner at Lightspeed (that has backed edtech startup FrontRow) says a big reason for rise in such platforms is the global trend of rise in social media creators and associated passion economy. “These new career paths are driving an increasing interest from consumers for extra-curricular education products,” he said. FrontRow is a platform for creative arts and sports and offers classes taught by celebrities.Another startup Crejo.Fun raised around $3 million seed funding in June led by Matrix Partners India and marquee angels including Flipkart's Kalyan Krishnamurthy, Phone Pe’s Sameer Nigam and Cred founder Kunal Shah. Co-founder Ankit Agarwal says they received high local and global investor interest for the round. “In edtech, it’s very important to own the content to ensure quality and the quality of teachers is critical to stand-out, especially in the extra-curricular activities space,” he said. Live teaching platform Teachmint, which hosts both academic and non-academic teachers, says it has seen a 25% month-on-month increase in the last one year in the number of hobby-driven learning hours. “Today, over one million hours of live learning takes place on Teachmint every day. 10% of our total classrooms are focused on extracurricular learning,” Mihir Gupta, co-founder and CEO, Teachmint, said. Industry trackers note that the extracurricular segment is expected to reach over $5.8 billion in 2021. But it’s mostly a fragmented market catered to by smaller localized players and startups are attempting to change that.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/extracurricular-learning-cos-catch-parents-investors-eyes/articleshow/86211797.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

The inquiry was conducted after one Rajni Devi alleged that the nurses and paramedical staff of the labour, delivery and recovery (LDR) room at the Sadar hospital compelled her and her family members to cough up money for better healthcare and facilities. Rajni alleged that she paid Rs900 first but the hospital staff were demanding more. A video of the entire episode had gone viral on social media. The victim and her family members were subsequently forced to give a written rejoinder that no money was demanded by the hospital staff. Dr Sharma and other members of the inquiry team, however, found the allegations to be true and removed Kiran Kumari, Anita Kumari, Majula Kumari, Ritesh, Noori and Geeta. Two other nurses — Nutan and Nitu — were removed on the charges of dereliction of duties. The civil surgeon said the department had received complaints regarding the issue. “We have already removed the LDR room staff and further steps to reshuffle the healthcare personnel are in the process. Departmental inquiries against them are also underway. If need be, the state health department will also be informed about it,” he said. “The healthcare services, including delivery, surgery or other medical services being provided at the Sadar hospital, primary health centres (PHCs) and other government hospitals are free of cost. We advise the patients and their attendants to inform the health authorities whose mobile and telephone numbers are displayed prominently, if anyone asks for money or tries to divert them away to private clinics or so,” he said. District health department officials have recently initiated steps to check the menace of touts at the government hospitals and rampant corrupt practices by the hospital staff, who misguide patients to visit private hospitals for better treatment. Steps like putting posters with captions such as ‘dalalon sey savdhan’ (beware of touts), surprise checks at hospitals, close monitoring by internal vigilance team on the outsiders roaming around hospital premises besides the healthcare personnel have been initiated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/five-nurses-3-paramedical-staff-of-bpur-hosp-removed/articleshow/86209720.cms||Kumar Rajesh

However, there were no cancellations, airport officials clarified. “A total of 11 departure and 10 arrival flights were delayed between 9am and 6pm owing to heavy rains in this part of the city. The average period of delay was between 35 minutes to 40 minutes,” airport director C Pattabhi said. Since morning, an intense spell of thunderstorm with moderate to heavy rainfall had continued over several parts of Kolkata and its neighbouring areas, including the area surrounding Kolkata airport. The intense rain caused major waterlogging on Jessore Road outside the airport, a one sq-km stretch of Haldiram’s on VIP Road and Chinar Park on New Town’s main arterial road, slowing down airport-bound traffic. Vistara was even quick to issue an advisory at 9.44am, alerting passengers about the waterlogging situation outside the airport. “#TravelUpdate: Due to waterlogging on account of heavy rains in Kolkata, traffic congestion is expected. Customers travelling are advised to allow more time for their journey to the airport. Thank you!” – the airline had tweeted.

But does the colour of the tail change over the years? A zoologist or a veterinary doctor can give the best answer to it, but recently the colour of a cow’s tail became a legal dispute in Vadodara. A dairy farmer from Padra, who owns one buffalo and three cows, dragged an insurance company to court as the latter denied her claim for a dead cow. The farmer Dipika Patel’s cow died on July 12 last year due to natural causes. When Patel filed a claim of Rs 50,000 with United Insurance Company Pvt Ltd, the company, in a bizarre reply, told Patel that as per their record the cow’s tail’s colour is white while in the photo of the carcass it looks black. Patel filed a complaint against the insurer at Vadodara District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum to get the claim amount of Rs 50,000. During the court proceedings, the insurance company’s lawyer argued that the claim was turned down as per the terms and conditions of the policy because the dead cow did not match with the insured cow. In response to the insurance company’s arguments, Patel’s lawyer submitted that the postmortem report also mentions that it is the same cow and not a different one. It was also argued that for identifying an animal its colour, shape of its horn among other characteristics are considered, but its real identification can be done by its tag. The court upheld the argument that the cow’s real identity is its tag. Patel’s insured cow’s tag number was 1626 and the dead cow’s tag number is also the same. The court also closely observed the photo of the carcass and noted that the tail is little bent and due to bad light in the photograph it may look black. “Insurance companies are statutory bodies and its responsibility is to not reject insured person’s claims by citing irrelevant technical issues. Thus, by rejecting the claim, the insurance company has been deficient in its services,” the court stated. It asked the insurance company to pay Rs 50,000 to Patel along with 9% interest and pay a compensation of Rs 10,000 for mental harassment and litigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/insurance-co-fails-to-make-head-or-tail-of-cows-colour-loses-case/articleshow/86211578.cms||Jay Pachchigar

Though the prevailing rainy spell is likely to reduce its intensity over the next couple of days, a fresh spell of showers is likely to lash the state Friday onwards. An official at Patna Meteorological Centre said light to moderate rainfall occurred at one or two places in north Bihar, few places in south-west, south-central and many places in south-east Bihar in the last 24 hours. The rainfall in Patna between 8.30am and 5.30pm on Tuesday was measured at 6mm. Fresh spell of rainfall is likely to occur around the weekend. The IMD stated in its all-India weather bulletin that a cyclonic circulation is likely to develop over north Bay of Bengal on September 17. It is likely to move west-northwestwards towards Odisha- West Bengal coast during subsequent 48 hours and cause fresh spell of enhance rainfall activity in eastern parts of India. “The cyclonic circulation is likely to weaken into a low-pressure area as it will move towards Odisha and West Bengal. The combined impact of the existing low-pressure area over north Chhattisgarh and the upcoming cyclonic circulation is likely to lead to rainfall across Bihar from Friday onwards. The intensity of rainfall is likely to be comparatively higher in northern parts of the state,” said Sanjay Kumar, a meteorologist at Patna Meteorological Centre. Weathermen have attributed the ongoing rainy spell to peripheral impact of the low-pressure areas over north Chhattisgarh and adjoining north Odisha, which was leading to moist winds in the region. The official at Patna Meteorological Centre said few districts in south-west Bihar, including Buxar, Rohtas and Arwal may witness heavy rainfall as well. “One or two places in south-western and central parts of the state are also likely to witness thunderstorm and lightning,” the official said. Meanwhile, Bihar has received 7% surplus rainfall in the monsoon season till date. As per data available on the website of IMD, the state has received 975.7mm rainfall from June 1 till September 14. The normal rainfall during the same period is 911.2mm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/met-expect-fairly-widespread-rain-in-bihar-till-september-18/articleshow/86208814.cms||Piyush Tripathi

Tejashwi said his party does not differentiate on the basis of caste or religion and repeated his father Lalu Prasad’s statement that a person’s religion, caste or gotra should only be humanity. Tejashwi also hit out at Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s ‘Abbajaan’ remark and tweeted: “UP CM should tell how many people who had been calling Pita-jaan have got employment, education and health facilities.” Tejashwi stated that BJP has no other tool but to spread hatred during the elections. While talking to a news a agency, Tejashwi made it clear his party will not be fighting UP elections, but will support those who will contest against the BJP. Earlier, former JD(U) MLC Krishna Kumar Singh joined the RJD. Speaking on the occasion, Tejashwi said: “We hold discussions on topics which are important, but they talk useless things. While we show the truth, they hide their faults through lies.” He said while education, health, irrigation facilities, employment and problems faced by the farmers should be the agenda, the present government was talking about Hindu-Muslim, Pakistan and Taliban. Tejashwi also took a swipe at CM Nitish KUmar’s janata darbar and said: “It is as if one is meeting an officer and not a public leader. In Lalu ji’s time, poor people used to directly come with their problems. But in Nitish ji’s janata darbar, a poor man is not heard because he does not know how to get the registration done.” However, BJP state spokesperson Prem Ranjan Patel hit back at Tejashwi saying the NDA’s agenda has always been “sabka saath, sabka vikas. In seven years of PM Modi’s rule, there has not been a single allegation, but Tejashwi’s family had ruled only for themselves and amassing property.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nda-govt-believes-in-divide-rule-tejas/articleshow/86209873.cms||Sheezan Nezami

The UP CM, in his public speech at Kushinagar on Sunday, had said before he came to power in 2017, people did not get rations “because only those who said ‘abbajaan’ used to digest the ration. The rations of Kushinagar used to go to Nepal and Bangladesh.” Addressing mediapersons after appointing former MLA Khiru Mahto and Gulab Mahto as the Jharkhand JD(U) president and vice-president, respectively, Lalan said, “The country belongs to everyone, be it Hindus, Muslims, Christians or other communities. Our country is known for ‘unity in diversity’. Political parties should maintain restraint and not make any such remarks which harm the country.” JD(U) is the first BJP ally to criticise the UP CM for his remark. And, it’s not for the first time also that JD(U) has distanced itself from the policies of Yogi or for that matter the BJP. AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi, who was in Patna on Tuesday, also said Yogi’s statement was a polarizing tactic. In a tweet, Owaisi said, “Nothing has changed in UP since 2017. Earlier it was shamshan-kabristan, now they are doing ration and abbajaan." Meanwhile, the JD(U) chief also criticised Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren for his statement purportedly aimed at Bhojpuri and Magahi-speaking people in his state. “Everybody has a right to settle wherever in the country they like,” Lalan said. Hemant, in an interview to a media house on Tuesday, said people who speak Bhojpuri and Magahi are dominant in nature. “These are not regional languages, but that of Bihar. Bhojpuri is a borrowed language. Then why Biharisation of Jharkhand? When Jharkhand was part of Bihar, people who spoke these two languages were involved in wrongdoings with the women of the then South Bihar. During the agitation for Jharkhand, they used abusive words in Bhojpuri for the natives. These two languages had no contribution during the Jharkhand movement. These are languages of Bihar,” Hemant said, inviting sharp reaction from Bihar BJP chief Sanjay Jaiswal, who said such statements reflected “the low mentality of a leader occupying a constitutional post”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/jdu-president-criticises-up-cm-for-his-abbajaan-remark/articleshow/86209826.cms||Jai Narain Pandey

The engineer was found in possession of Rs 15.5 lakh in cash, gold jewellery worth Rs 33 lakh, three flats, including two at Krishna Apartment on Boring Road here and plots of land near Saguna Mor in Patna and Hajipur in Vaishali. The estimated cost of the two flats at Krishna Apartment is around Rs 1 crore. The engineer had purchased the flats recently. A senior bureau official said a disproportionate assets case was lodged against the executive engineer in the special vigilance court and search warrant was obtained. However, the operation was delayed as the engineer had gone to Delhi. A VIB team led by deputy superintendent of police Surendra Kumar Mahuar started the search operation around 10am in flat number 403 of Nityanand Enclave at Gosaitola near Sadaquat Ashram soon after the executive engineer returned home from Delhi on Tuesday. The DSP Mahuar said deeds of flats and land were recovered during the search operation. More than eight passbooks of different banks were also seized, he said. The search team also seized documents related to other investments made by the executive, who is posted at Gulzarbagh division of the RCD in Patna district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/vig-raids-yield-engineers-assets-worth-rs-1-76-crore/articleshow/86209662.cms||Ramashankar
---||Business||NSE probes freak F&O trades||Mumbai: The NSE is looking into a series of freak trades that took place in its futures & options (F&O) segment in contracts on five of the most traded stocks — Reliance Industries, Bharti Airtel, HDFC, HDFC Bank and TCS. These trades were done at prices that were about 10% above the then prevailing market price. Such trades, at times also called ‘fat finger trades’, have the potential to distort prices in the cash segment too as it often picks up signals from the F&O segment. The NSE said on its twitter handle that some unusual trades were observed during the session, which were executed by a trading member. “The same is being examined by the regulator team of the exchange,” it said. However, the trades were done within the permissible limits, it added. Of late, there have been some cases of freak trades in the F&O segment of the market. The exchange has been working to put in place some system so that such freak trades could be avoided. Among Tuesday’s trades, RIL futures were traded at Rs 2,616 while the price of the stock was Rs 2,392. Likewise, trades in HDFC Bank futures were recorded at Rs 1,715 compared to its stock price of Rs 1,565. Similar trades were reported in Bharati Airtel, HDFC and TCS, traders said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/nse-probes-freak-fo-trades/articleshow/86215061.cms||---

Jaiswal said on the induction of Paras into the Union cabinet, “As should be clear as to which organization is in the NDA and it is for everyone to see. Today, the LJP is a part of the NDA and Pashupati Kumar Paras is our minister at the Centre.” Paras is in the Union cabinet because he, before the recent cabinet expansion, split the six-member LJP parliamentary party in the Lok Sabha and became the chief of the majority faction comprising five LJP MPs. He also declared himself as the chief of the LJP faction led by him. Consequently, Chirag as an MP was left alone and moved the dispute to the Election Commission of India (EC) with which the matter is pending for resolution. Incidentally, BJP minister Neeraj Kumar Singh Babloo on Monday said “Chirag was with the NDA, is in the NDA, and will remain even in the future.” While the JD(U) did not appreciate Babloo’s statement, the RJD alleged duplicity in the BJP and the NDA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ljp-is-part-of-nda-says-bjp-bihar-chief/articleshow/86208696.cms||Abhay Singh
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh CM Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy to inaugurate iconic cow worship centre during Brahmotsavams||TIRUPATI: The Saptha Gau Pradakshina Shala, a first-of-its-kind iconic centre for the worship of the cow, is all set to be inaugurated on October 11 during the annual Tirumala Brahmotsavams. The structure is being built at a cost of Rs 13 crore near Alipiri in the temple city. After the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) trust board passed a resolution to construct the Pradakshina Shala in 2016, former trust board member J Sekhar expressed his consent to bear the cost of construction and to hand over the completed project to the TTD. Sekhar had also agreed to bear the maintenance costs of the project for a lifetime. Though the construction was supposed to have been completed earlier, works were stalled due to Covid-19. Following the easing of restrictions, work is expected to be completed by the end of September. Speaking to TOI after reviewing the progress of the works on Tuesday, Sekhar said the centre will have a ‘gau tulabharam’, which is a first-of-its-kind in the country. “A specially-made weighing-bridge from Madhya Pradesh is being procured for the purpose. As part of the gau tulabharam, a sacred cow will be made to stand on one side of the scale and devotees can extend donations of their choice in equivalent measure of the weight of the cow. The donations received will be utilised towards the upkeep of the gau mandir and the gau tulabharam facilities,” Sekhar said. Devotees coming to Tirumala can now stop by at the Saptha Gau Pradakshina Shala, where they can perform the gau puja. While the trial run at the Pradakshina Shala is expected to begin from October 2, chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy will formally inaugurate the structures during the Tirumala Brahmotsavams on October 11. The TTD trust board had passed a resolution in 2016 to construct the Pradakshina Shala.

---||Business||In a first, Tatas may install CEO at helm, says report||Mumbai: Tata Sons, which controls India’s biggest conglomerate Tata Group, may consider creating a CEO position for the first time in its 104-year history in a bid to reorganise leadership structure and improve governance standards, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday. Historically, Tata Sons’s operations and investment in portfolio companies have been overseen by its executive chairman. But it had a COO position occupied by Farokh Subedar from 2010 to September 2017. Though Tata Sons is yet to issue an official statement on the leadership revamp, Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter, said the plan is to have a CEO guide the company’s sprawling businesses, while the chairman supervises the CEO’s functioning on behalf of shareholders. The report further said the approval of Ratan Tata, chairman of Tata Trusts, which owns a majority stake in Tata Sons, will be key to implement the change. Current Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran’s five-year tenure ends next February and the company is considering renewing his term, the report said. “Any decision regarding succession at Tata Sons will be taken after fair and due deliberations by its board,” Ratan Tata had said earlier. The report said heads of Tata Group companies, including the chief of Tata Steel, are being considered for the CEO’s role. It, however, added that no final decision has been arrived at, and the plan and details could still change. A group CEO will have an array of challenges. Tata Steel is racing to pare a $10-billion debt, while Tata Motors has had three consecutive years of losses through March 2021. Besides, Tata Sons’s plan to move further into the digital space and capitalise on the country’s growing base of online shoppers has yet to bear fruit. Despite having TCS at its disposal, the plan to launch an e-commerce super app has been delayed. Though Tata Sons is not a listed entity, the proposed leadership structure overhaul, if implemented, will be in line with capital market regulator Sebi’s recommendation that listed companies should split the role of CEO and chairman by next April, the report said. The proposed addition of “a professional manager atop Tata Sons also shines a spotlight on how Ratan Tata — who continues to shape the conglomerate — might envision his own transition from his current role of semi-retired chairman-emeritus,” Bloomberg added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/in-a-first-tatas-may-install-ceo-at-helm-says-report/articleshow/86214967.cms||---

They were demanding reservation of seats for the pupils who passed their Class XII exams from the Bihar School Examination Board (BSEB). Before the counselling sessions could begin at Patna Science College and Patna College, a section of students prevented the admission seekers from entering the centres. They also asked the teachers and other supporting staff not to engage themselves in admission-related works. The agitating students, led by the former president of the Patna University Students’ Union, Manish Yadav, pointed out that the BSEB students were given very low marks despite writing their exams in the physical mode. Their counterparts from other boards, on the contrary, got higher marks without any examination. Later, PU proctor, Rajneesh Kumar, told this newspaper, “The students’ welfare dean, Anil Kumar, tried to convince the protesters, but they did not relent. Consequently, the counselling session and the admission-related work remained disturbed for a long time.” However, the counselling and admission of students at other centres like B N College and Magadh Mahila College went on peacefully. Students were admitted to the allotted courses after verification of their documents and certificates at the college counters. The principal of B N College, Raj Kishore Prasad, claimed, “Several aspirants from the centres where the counselling session was disturbed reached here and took admission.” On Day 1, the admission process was slow as only 150 students, including 54 at Magadh Mahila College, 53 at B N College, 23 at Patna College, and 20 at Patna Science College, were admitted. The process of counselling and admission at all these centres will continue till Saturday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/protesters-disturb-patna-universitys-admission-process/articleshow/86209005.cms||B K Mishra
---||Business||Yes Bank, six execs settle Sebi case||Mumbai: Six top executives of Yes Bank, along with the lender, have paid about Rs 1.7 crore to settle a case with markets regulator Sebi. The case related to selective disclosure of price-sensitive information about RBI’s risk assessment report on the lender. The case was settled under Sebi’s consent mechanism where all the seven entities together paid up the fine without admitting or denying their fault. The Sebi order noted that on February 13, 2019, the bank had disclosed to the exchanges that the RBI had found in its report ‘nil’ divergence between Yes Bank’s reporting of its bad loans and what the central bank’s own auditors had found about the same number. It had a substantial impact on Yes Bank’s stock price. Sebi investigations found that although the bank had highlighted the positive observation from the RBI report, it had not disclosed several of the central bank’s adverse comments about the lender. After Sebi initiated an investigation and issued a show-cause notice to the seven entities, they approached the regulator to settle the case. After the regulator’s empowered panel agreed to the terms of the settlement, the seven entities paid up nearly Rs 1.7 crore on August 9.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/yes-bank-six-execs-settle-sebi-case/articleshow/86215241.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Number of Zero FIRs grows since Disha case in 2019||VIJAYAWADA: Since the horrific gang rape and murder of a veterinary doctor in Hyderabad in December 2019, Andhra Pradesh police have begun implementing ‘Zero FIR’, a non-jurisdictional document that can be registered for a cognizable offence. From December 03 till date, 546 Zero FIRs have been registered across various police stations in the state. Out of which, 149 were registered in 2021 (till August 31), 338 of them were registered in 2020, and 59 in 2019 (from December). According to police sources, a majority of these cases (46%) pertains to missing persons, followed by sexual offences and other cognizable crimes. Compared to Telangana, Andhra Pradesh files 64% fewer Zero FIRs. This is predominantly due to lack of awareness of the Zero FIRs in the state. It is pertinent to note that Zero FIRs were conceptualised much before the veterinary gang rape incident. The idea came to fore after the 2012 Nirbhaya gang rape where the government set up Justice Verma committee to look at amendments to criminal law in India. In fact, apart from Justice Verma committee report—on October 12, 2015, the Union ministry of home affairs issued an advisory to all chief secretaries of all states and Union territories, to instruct the concerned departments to compulsorily register FIRs. The home ministry stressed that a police officer is duty-bound to register a case on the basis of such information disclosing a cognizable offence and an FIR has to be registered irrespective of territorial jurisdiction. Nevertheless, none of the states bothered to implement the concept for a long time. However, the issue got highlighted in December 2019 after the Shamsabad police station in Telangana delayed in filing the FIR in the gang rape and murder incident citing jurisdictional issues. Director general of police D Gautam Sawang sent an order to all police stations to implement Zero FIRs with immediate effect right after the incident. Cops explained that within a month of implementing Zero FIRs, they were surprised to find 59 FIRs registered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/no-of-zero-firs-grows-since-disha-case-in-19/articleshow/86210317.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

According to police, the two accused Sachin Rawal and Dhruvesh alias Digu Rawal had attacked the dog on September 2 confusing it with another canine which used to bark at them. Around noon, the other dog was allegedly creating noise by barking near the house of the accused duo. Hearing this, the duo came out of their house with a baseball bat, seeing which the dog ran away. They followed the dog but it managed to give them the slip. However, they came across the pregnant dog and vented their frustration on the female dog, mercilessly beat the canine. Sachin later dragged it on the road too. Locals who learnt about the incident called 1962 Animal Helpline and the dog received immediate treatment. On September 8, when an animal activist from People for Animals NGO got to know about the incident from a local resident, he approached the police with a complaint against the two accused and an offence was registered. Police are, however, yet to arrest the accused duo. “Right now, the dog is safe and healthy and is expected to deliver in the next few days. We have asked the people living in the locality to keep an eye on it and inform us whenever it delivers,” said the activist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/two-batter-pregnant-dog-with-baseball-bat/articleshow/86211483.cms||---
---||Business||IDFC’s reverse merger plan hit||Mumbai: IDFC Ltd, the parent of IDFC Bank, on Tuesday indicated to investors that it faced challenges in pursuing a reverse merger with IDFC First Bank. According to analysts present in the meeting, the management said that the parent company holds stake in IDFC Mutual Fund, and two ventures — one with the Delhi government and one with Karnataka government — would need to be exited and there are challenges in exiting these. Shares of IDFC were down 3.4%, while the IDFC First Bank stock rose 2.4% following the analyst meet. Although neither had announced merger plans in the past, the same has often been speculated by analysts. Their expectation of the holding company merging into the bank got a boost after the RBI in July clarified that IDFC can exit as the promoter of IDFC First Bank. The central bank had also allowed small finance banks (SFBs), which came under a holding company structure, to reverse merge with their parent. Following this, a couple of SFBs merged with the parent. For IDFC shareholders, the merger with the bank is beneficial considering that there have been reports that the company is selling its MF arm. If post-sale proceeds are distributed to shareholders, it would be very tax-inefficient as IDFC would be paying capital gains as well as dividend distribution tax. In the event of a merger, the sale proceeds need not be distributed but can be infused into the bank as capital. As the bank’s equity is trading at higher multiples compared to the parent, there is an upside for IDFC shareholders if there is a merger. However, IDFC First Bank already has enough capital and may not be able to deploy the fund immediately. During the call, IDFC’s non-executive chairman Vinod Rai said that there were challenges in unwinding the complex corporate structure of IDFC. He also said that the corporation had initiated the process of divesting stake in non-core subsidiaries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/idfcs-reverse-merger-plan-hit/articleshow/86215163.cms||---

While patrolling, powermen have come across a major portion of the wire which has been damaged and needs immediate change. Assistant executive engineer (AEE, transmission) Shilpi said, “Several blocks such as Katihar, Manihari, Mansahi, Amdabad, Korha, Falka and Barari will go without power from 11 am to 4 o' clock in the evening, on Wednesday.” “During the shutdown period, the total electricity supply to grid substation (Katihar), grid sub-station (Manihari) and traction sub-station (TSS) of North-Eastern Frontier Railway under Katihar division will be interrupted,” she said, adding, “The Katihar division of NFR has been informed in advance about the interruption. However, they have an alternate power supply source to run the trains.” “Phase conductors and jumpers will be also replaced because damage was detected during patrolling. The detection of fault helps us to carry out repair or replacement work in a planned manner. Besides, it takes less time. But, when the fault or damage is detected late, then we face a lot of problems, such as informing the higher ups, procuring the material and manpower to carry out the repair work,” the AEE added. “Apart from this, repair work is being carried out in view of the upcoming festivals.

The city has also administered at least one dose to 82% of the 93.48 lakh eligible population. However, sero surveys are not fool-proof: a survey in Delhi had indicated that 60% of citizens had antibodies to the virus but the capital was among the worst hit during the second wave with 25,000 cases reported daily. “If a survey is not done scientifically by choosing people in a randomized manner, it may not be very indicative of the ground realities,’’ said a doctor. BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani refused to confirm the numbers. “We are fine-tuning the findings of the fifth sero survey report and will release it in a day or two,’’ he said. The BMC administration is still worried that people will become lax about Covid-appropriate behavior such as wearing a mask or maintaining social distance. “If a new variant emerges, then everyone could be vulnerable to Covid,’’ said the doctor. The fifth survey was done during the lockdown, in the second week of August—ahead of the rising curve noticeable in the last 15 days in the city. The fourth survey among the pediatric population showed 50% of children tested had antibodies to the virus. The third survey across 24 civic wards in February-March showed 41% in slums and 28.5% in non-slum areas had antibodies. The first two surveys were in three wards; the exposure was found to be 45% in slums and 18% in buildings during the second survey in August 2020, and 57% and 16% respectively during the first survey in July 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-5th-sero-survey-may-show-70-80-popln-with-antibodies-now/articleshow/86214023.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Salary scam: Accused produced in court, remanded in judicial custody||Times News Network Chandigarh: The crime branch on Tuesday, produced a junior assistant and home guard volunteer in the local court in the Rs 1.1 crore salary scam. The court remanded them in judicial custody. Police arrested Balwinder Kumar, junior assistant and then in-charge of the salary branch at police headquarters on Saturday and obtained their three-day police remand for further interrogation. A case was registered under relevant sections of the IPC and the Prevention of Corruption Act at Sector 3 police station on February 25, 2020. During investigations, the crime branch found that around 161 police personnel got extra money in their accounts. Most of them informed the accounts department and returned it. However, 64 police personnel, in connivance with clerks of the accounts branch, kept quiet. The clerks took a share of the extra salary credited to their accounts. This led to a fraud of over Rs 1 crore between 2016 and 2019. The incident came to light when the police department received an anonymous complaint and an internal investigation was conducted in 2019. On the request of the police department, a special audit team checked the accounts department books. The audit was completed 10 days ago and its report stated Rs 1.1 crore extra was credited to the accounts of constables and head constables from 2016 to 2019. Now, the police department plans to conduct an audit of the accounts department from 2013 to 2015, too. Balwinder dealt with the salaries of constables and head constables of the UT police and was deployed in the accounts branch in 2013. Crime branch police said during the probe, the department started recovering the extra money disbursed and almost 100% of it has been reclaimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/salary-scam-accused-produced-in-court-remanded-in-judicial-custody/articleshow/86211526.cms||---

As per the figures presented in the corporation council meeting held here on Tuesday, 2,04,430 kg non-recyclable waste was sorted from three dump yards at Putharikandam, Erumakuzhy and Attakulangara. It is the first time ever the city corporation collected legacy waste from the dump yards. The enormous quantity of legacy waste obtained from three dump yards reflects the growing economic and environmental impact from the rampant use of non-recyclable materials in the city. The civic body had engaged 40 workers pooled from destitute camps and migrant labourer camps at SMV school and Attakulangara school as part of clearing the dump yard at Erumakuzhy in 2020. Tenders were called for bio-mining of legacy waste and initial estimates went above Rs 1 crore for the entire project. It was when the tender processes were halted following lockdown; the corporation thought of engaging persons camped in schools depending upon their willingness. The corporation had estimated that over 11,000 cubic metres of unsegregated waste had been piled up at Erumakuzhy and Palayam over the last few years. The dump yard at Palayam has been cleared through bio-mining as part of the smart city project. It was estimated that there could be roughly 9,684 cubic metres of legacy waste spread over 40 cents of land (0.4 Acre) at Palayam. The survey results prepared in 2020 showed that 2,388 cubic metres of waste had accumulated at Erumakuzhy. The corporation recently entered into an agreement with Clean Kerala company for the collection of legacy waste left over from non-recyclable waste which did not have any takers. The agreement was executed for collection of thermocol and rexin waste at Rs 10 per kg along with other kinds of waste like leather, rubber sandals, bags, furniture and plastic. It had earlier mulled over co-processing of non-recyclable plastic waste and had tapped the possibilities of supply of alternate fuel in the cement industry to deal with soaring non-recyclable plastic waste.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/2-lakh-kg-of-waste-handed-over-to-clean-kerala-ltd/articleshow/86211556.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||Kolkata||‘Skipping flu shots, less exposure to virus lead to viral pneumonia in kids’||Kolkata: An increasing number of children are being admitted in hospitals across the state with viral pneumonia or similar symptoms. Doctors said that even while a few sporadic cases of viral pneumonia are not unexpected during monsoon, the count at present is quite alarming. TOI on September 11 had reported on how PICUs (paediatric intensive care units) across government and private hospitals in Kolkata were filling up fast with children suffering from viral pneumonia. The situation is not restricted to city hospitals. According to NRS Medical College associate professor and also paediatric nephrology unit in-charge Biswanath Basu, one of the reasons for the spike could be because most children had given the pneumonia vaccine or the booster dose a miss last year due to the pandemic. “There could be several factors, including missing influenza shots last year, less exposure to the virus due to more strict adherence to norms like masking and staying indoors during the lockdown, leading to falling immunity against the influenza virus,” said Basu. Institute of Child Health (ICH) associate professor Prabhas Prasun Giri said similar kind of viral pneumonia outbreaks in children are being witnessed in the UK and the US. Both influenza A and B, RSV, metapneumovirus and parainfluenza virus are causing the problem. The respiratory viral panel PCR test detects the exact virus. While the cost of the test at institutes like ICH is about Rs 8,000 the same could be close to three times in private hospitals. Doctors said places like NICED that have such facilities should be opened so that samples can be tested free for parents who cannot afford them. “We are seeing a large number of kids with symptoms of flu like fever and cough. A few of them have required admission. In most of these cases, they have tested positive for other viruses like RSV and influenza,” said Rajesh Kumar Singh, paediatric consultant, Fortis Hospital, Anandapur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/skipping-flu-shots-less-exposure-to-virus-lead-to-viral-pneumonia-in-kids/articleshow/86211580.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Two girls noticed that someone threw a stone at his bike due to which he fell off his cycle,” the boy’s uncle Nitin Sharma said.He said that Krishna was trying to get up when the unidentified man approached him. “Krishna thought that the man was coming near him to offer help. However, he picked him and took him across the street where they bundled him into a vehicle,” he said.Krishna’s father, Ashutosh Sharma told TOI that so far no ransom call was made to him. “I am extremely worried about my son’s condition. We don’t know if he has eaten or not,” he said. Nitin said that the family comes from a humble background and they don’t have any enmity with anyone. “We want him to safely return,” he said.Police said that the family members had searched around the area for the missing boy but did not find any clue about him. They then filed an FIR at the police station. “We have constituted teams to track him down. Based on the description provided by the people who last saw him, other nearby police stations were put on alert too,” an official said, adding that the abduction case remains unclear because neither the family has received any family call nor have they suspected anyone else who could abduct the boy.Police said that CCTVs of the nearby areas were examined while another team spoke to local residents to see if they had noticed any suspect moving about the area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/no-clue-of-missing-8-yr-old-boy-even-after-3-days/articleshow/86215912.cms||---

The accused was identified as Shifan Taj (23), a native of Amballoor near Kanjiramattom. He has reportedly transferred large amounts of money to the bank account of one of the accused in the case and the excise suspect that it was used to fund the drug smuggling. “We have been interrogating several persons in connection with the case and it was found that the accused transferred over Rs 2 lakhs to the bank account of one of the persons arrested earlier. Taj could not give a satisfactory explanation about the transfer and he has been arraigned as an accused under NDPS Act on charges of conspiracy. He has been remanded and further probe has been initiated,” said official sources. The investigation has been expanded around the bank transactions of the six accused persons to find the involvement of more people in the case. The plan is to identify the suppliers and buyers of the accused in and outside the state. “We are looking at persons who made financial deals with the accused persons and the details are being collected using bank transactions. A list of suspects has been made and interrogation has started. It seems the gang, part of an interstate drug peddling network, had several customers,” said sources. However, the investigation team is yet to trace the suppliers of MDMA though they confirmed that the contraband was seized from Triplicane in Chennai. Most phone numbers collected by the excise officers were switched off. Other numbers, which got connected, were found to be taken using fake IDs and the owners of the sim cards have no connection to the case. The accused persons are now in judicial custody. It is yet to be confirmed whether the drug was locally manufactured in Chennai or smuggled in from other countries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/excise-arrests-one-more-in-kochi-mdma-seizure-case/articleshow/86211577.cms||---

Captive solar plants are eligible for exemption for seven years from the date of the commissioning of the projects. Despite this exemption, the discoms have been sending notices to the power producers for the payment of the electricity duty.Earlier, Rajasthan Solar Association had approached senior officials in the departments of finance, energy secretary, nodal agency RRECL for a review of the demand in the light of the exemptions provided in the policy. Finding no solution, RSA had sought legal remedy and moved a petition against the imposition of the electricity duty with the Rajasthan High court, Jodhpur.In the interim order, the court asked the members of the solar industry to submit their grievances within six weeks prior to the next hearing date. The court has also directed the department concerned not to initiate any action forcing the members to pay the duty.Vishnu Khandelwal, executive member of RSA, said despite exemption in the Rajasthan Solar Policy, discoms demand for the electricity duty payments will scare away prospective investors in the state.Ashu Gupta, regulatory expert and RSA executive member, said by not adhering to the Rajasthan Solar Policy, which was duly cleared by the state government and its cabinet, will also impact the development of solar projects in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/court-stays-discoms-duty-demand-on-solar-plants/articleshow/86215922.cms||---

The counsels for the petitioners submitted their reply arguments to the counter affidavits filed by the Andhra Pradesh Public Service Commission (APPSC). The entire process of conducting Group-1 mains examination was illegal and an attempt was made to infuse the candidates of their choice in the service which is nothing but a ‘constitutional coup’, said Thandava Yogesh, advocate representing one of the petitioners. Yogesh argued that the appointment of APPSC secretary was made without following due process. Since from the appointment of the secretary, the chairman of the commission has been side stepped in every major decision. While it was the responsibility of the chairman to approve the question paper and appoint examiners, he was not even made party to those decision by the secretary which is evident from the affidavit filed by chairman. Senior counsel B Adnarayana Rao who also argued on behalf of the petitioners earlier, also submitted that the digital evaluation method adopted by the APPSC was not done according to the norms. While there have been many doubts over digital evaluation process, the marks were given in an excel sheet instead of writing on the answer sheets. Yogesh pointed out that the master record of the excel sheet was received by APPSC on April 1 and the results were declared on April 28. He said that the APPSC did not explain the reasons for delay. He expressed doubts that the marks have been tampered in the excel sheet to recruit their own people into service which is an attack on the Constitution. Earlier, the standing counsel for APPSC, R V Mallikharjuna Rao said that the petitions were not maintainable as the mains examination was conducted according to the norms prescribed in the notification.Considering the arguments on both sides, Justice DV S S Somayajulu reserved orders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/order-on-group-1-exams-reserved/articleshow/86211568.cms||Srikanth Aluri
---||Thiruvananthapuram||KWA officer arrested for accepting bribe||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) officials have arrested a senior official of Kerala Water Authority (KWA) while accepting bribe from a contractor. KWA public health north division executive engineer John Koshi was caught while accepting a bribe of Rs 25,000 from a contractor named Manoharan. The arrest was made by a VACB unit led by DSP Ashok Kumar. The VACB officials said John Koshi demanded a bribe from the complainant to pass his bills despite the latter securing a favourable order from the state high court for passing the bills without further delay. Manoharan was the contractor who undertook works related to replacement of pipes and related maintenance works between Chekkalamukku and Societymukku near Sreekaryam under KWA PH north division. The works were carried out under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) projects scheme for 2017-18. The complainant alleged that despite successful completion of the works, there was a delay of over three months in passing the bills. Following this, he personally met the executive engineer to enquire about the reason for delay. But, he was told to pay a bribe of Rs 10,000 for passing the bills. When he refused, he was met with another delay of 16 months for clearing his dues. Frustrated, Manoharan approached the state high court with a plea. Though the court ordered to clear the bills within 15 days, the executive engineer chose to ignore this order, forcing Manoharan to approach the court again. This time, a portion of his bills - Rs 40 lakhs - was cleared. When he asked about the rest of the dues, he was demanded a bribe of Rs 25,000 again. Following this, Manoharan decided to alert the Vigilance department. He filed his complaint before VACB Intelligence SP K E Baiju, which eventually led to the arrest of John Koshi on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/kwa-officer-arrested-for-accepting-bribe/articleshow/86211620.cms||---

Several hospitals in Mumbai have registered more dengue and malaria admissions than Covid in the past month. The BMC on Tuesday confirmed 85 cases so far in September. The numbers don’t include suspected hospitalisation or cases that don’t have lab-confirmed diagnosis. From a dozen dengue cases in June, it rose to 28 in July and 144 in August. No deaths have been reported till now. Since January, 305 dengue cases have been recorded in the city. In all of 2020, 129 cases were reported, and in 2019, 920 cases. Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer, said most of the cases have been reported from E (Mazgaon, Byculla), G south (Dharavi, Dadar, Mahim) and G north (Worli, Prabhadevi, Mahalaxmi) wards. It has become endemic in some wards and vector control is proving a challenge due to vast open spaces, such as railways tracks and yards. The BMC’s pesticide control team said breeding inside homes is a problem too. Bombay Hospital, which has been focusing on Covid for the past 17 months, saw more dengue and malaria admissions for a month. Dr Gautam Bhansali said he has nearly 20 dengue patients. “Most have typical presentations of falling platelets and WBC counts,” he said. The good change this year is early detection, said Bhansali, since people are rushing to test for fear of Covid. Dr Shahid Bharmare, who consults with three hospitals in the central suburbs, said they have tackled more cases of malaria, dengue and respiratory infections than Covid recently. Dr Samrat Shah, internist at Bhatia Hospital, said he is seeing three to four dengue patients every day with 50% requiring hospitalisation. “Dengue is more prevalent than malaria. Besides fever and joint pain, now it’s causing high fever with tremendous weakness and fatigue,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-dengue-cloud-over-city-too-e-g-wards-report-most-cases/articleshow/86214087.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Kolkata||After push from Centre, West Bengal to prepare database of children with co-morbidities||KOLKATA: With vaccine against Covid-19 for children slated to get rolled out in one to one-and-a-half months from now, the state government will start preparing list of children with co-morbidities. The Union health ministry has said that the inoculation drive for children between 12 and 17 years will begin with kids with co-morbidities. Sources at Swasthya Bhawan said mechanism is being devised to prepare a list of children. “We are yet to get a list of co-morbidities that should be considered while prioritising the recipients. But we have certainly started working on the modalities like collecting data from paediatric cancer registry, hospital based data on children with heart and other chronic conditions,” said a senior health department official. ZyCov-D is the first vaccine for children to get emergency use authorisation in India. Even during the rollout for the adult vaccination the government took the-phase wise manner to include different priority groups. “Though Covid-19 infection among children has not been that severe, the virus could prove dangerous for kids with co-morbid condition. Therefore it is always a wise option to provide the protection first to the most vulnerable,” said Apurba Ghosh, director Institiute of Child Health (ICH) ICH was among the institutes where ZyCov-D was put under Phase III clinical trial in children. “Just like adults, children with co-morbidity and compromised immunity are more prone to complications of infections. And introducing the vaccine in phases will ensure a more efficient inoculation drive,” said professor at ICH Jaydeep Choudhury, the co-investigator of the ZyCov-D trial. Unlike the three adult vaccines that are being administered in India currently, this home grown vaccine is DNA based and is a needle free vaccine. “Beginning from those with co-morbid conditions the drive will ultimately be extended universally to the eligible paediatric population. Even while the infection itself might not be severe in most children they are likely to be part of the transmission chain. So it is very important to bring children under the inoculation drive,” said senior clinical trial specialist Santanu Tripathi. Apart from the hospital network – private as well as government officials hinted at roping in organisations like Indian Academy of Paediatrics to compile the co-morbidity data. Even as there have been cases of breakthrough infections among the fully vaccinated adult population, data so far shows the vaccine preventing the severity of the infection and reducing mortality.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/after-push-from-centre-state-to-prepare-database-of-children-with-co-morbidities/articleshow/86211632.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

Officers working on the project made a note of this in their report submitted to the Haryana Assembly speaker. A meeting was held between administrative and police officials to remove the encroachments. During the meeting with Panchkula mayor Kulbhushan Goyal, deputy commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh and deputy commissioner of police (DCP) Mohit Handa, Haryana Assembly speaker Gian Chand Gupta directed officials concerned to remove the encroachments. The speaker said, “A lot of effort have been made to get approval for a medical college here and encroachment is becoming a hurdle which cannot be tolerated at all.” Officials said that the land on which the medical college will come up includes 31 kanals and two marlas of Municipal Corporation (MC) and 18 kanal and 18 marlas of Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA). The speaker formed a committee comprising the DC, DCP and MC commissioner, who will be responsible for removal of encroachments from the land. Officials assured that encroachments would be removed before the beginning of Navratras. Speaker also sought suggestions from officials on making Mata Mansa Devi temple as a Religious Tourist Centre. As for removal of encroachments at the villages of Batour, Alipur, Sukhdarshanpur, Jalouli, Kot and Chandimandir, officials are conducting drone mapping and marking land which belongs to the MC or HUDA. Special duty timings to end encroachment: It was decided that MC and HUDA anti-encroachment wing officials would work from 12 noon to 8pm and the police post in-charge would help officials during the anti-encroachment drive. Estate officer, HUDA Mamta Sharma also sought a reply from a junior engineer fo his negligence during anti-encroachment duty. Work on underpass to start soon Officials said that Panchkula administration had submitted Rs 25 crore for construction of an underpass to connect sectors 12, 12A road with sectors 20 and 21. On August 19, National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) approved the vehicle underpass to be built at Zirakpur-Kalka Expressway to connect Sectors 20 and 21 with the rest of the city. This was a longstanding demand of a large number of residents living in sector 20 and 21. Heavy traffic jams throughout the day can be seen at the Sector 20 light point every day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/encroachments-stall-work-on-med-college-speaker-calls-for-demolition/articleshow/86211624.cms||Arvind Bishnoi

Jose, who set off on his cycle from Thrissur on July 15, had actually wanted to reach there on Sept 11 to celebrate his 80th birthday after cycling 4,500km. He got stuck at Leh after an unexpected snowfall and was able to make it on Tuesday as the weather improved. Speaking over the phone, Jose said he just wanted to send a message to the youths that it is possible to undertake arduous tasks if they lead a disciplined life. Jose, who retired from Thrissur medical college as a plumber, said he used to smoke and drink and his life changed in 1983. “I then achieved a rare feat of running 10,000m in 39 minutes and eight seconds. Newspapers published photos of me smoking and on seeing this a doctor at the medical college called me at his home and gave me a book about smoking. He said I shouldn’t squander my talent and that day I quit smoking and drinking,” he said. Gokul PR from Ayyanthole in Thrissur, who accompanied Jose said the last leg of the rally was challenging. “Jose could not cycle for around 5km when his internal oxygen level dipped, which is quite common at high altitude locations. He managed to cycle the last 1km,” he added. Jose was all praise for the military personnel stationed there. “Many of us don’t realize the extreme hardships they endure here to protect our nation. I completed the trip only with their support,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/80-year-old-pedals-to-his-dream-destination-at-17600ft-above-msl/articleshow/86211618.cms||T Ramavarman

The board has also taken serious note over the delay in starting of 18MLD reverse osmosis (RO) set up to process the effluents draining into the river. The board has warned strict action will be taken against the units that flout the order. Though the RO plant is almost ready, carelessness of the common effluent treatment plant (CETP) trust has led to delay in startung the plant. Though the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had also ordered a strict ban on discharging effluents into the river, it failed to prevent the units from draining pollutants into the waterbody. Looking at the situation, the RPCB issued the order on September 13 to CETP to stop textile units from operating. According to information, the CETP trust itself was not following the orders of thde NGT and the Pradushan Nivaran Evum Paryavaran Sankarshan Samiti, informed RPCB chairperson Veenu Gupta. Samiti secretary Om Prakash Soni said if CETP fully abided the orders of NGT, the problem of pollution could have been solved to a great extent. Textile units in Balotara have been functioning for the last 40 years but have done precious little to save the environment. RPCB member Anand Mohan said the board took serious note of carelessness of the CETP trust by not starting the RO plant which led the textile units to release polluted water into the river. He said the CETP trust had told the board that the RO plant was ready but when checked it was not operational. In this regard, letters were written to the CETP to start the plant on January 27, March 24, and on April 15. Mohan said the plant was almost ready and could be made operational in 2-4 days if they wanted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/800-textile-units-in-barmer-told-to-shut-shop-for-polluting-luni/articleshow/86215923.cms||---

As per the proposal, the corporation will earn money from the transportation of 14 types of dry waste while it has to pay for multi-layer covers, bags, chappals, clothes and road waste. Pet bottles and hard plastic, two of the major components of non-biodegradable waste in the city, will fetch the corporation Rs 15 and Rs 13 per kilo respectively. Coloured plastic, rubber and coconut shells are other items for which the corporation will receive money from the agencies for transportation. The most commonly dumped plastic waste - milk cover will - earn the corporation Rs 13 per kg while carry bags will be transported at Rs 7 per kg. Oil packaging, white plastic covers and paper waste are other types of dry waste for which the corporation will now earn money for collection and transportation. At the same time, the corporation will have to shell out money for the collection and transportation of clothes, bags and chappals at rates ranging between Rs 5 to Rs 8 per kg. Road waste will be transported at a cost of Rs 7.5 per kg. Meanwhile, BJP councillors relayed a volley of questions at the health standing committee chairman Jameela Sreedharan soon after she sought the council’s approval for the proposal. BJP councillor Anil Kumar alleged dry waste collection in the city has always been ridden with corruption charges and that the agencies are cheating the corporation and swindling money out of the civic body. The BJP councillors demanded formation of a sub-committee to consider various factors like previous experience of the agencies, the location where waste is transported, mode of transportation and the like. Countering the BJP’s charges, health committee chairperson Jameela Sreedharan replied that one of the chosen agencies - Sarojini Ponniah foundation - had come to the aid of the civic body even when the corporation owed the firm lakhs as payment. She said that owing to Covid induced lockdown, waste transportation was affected and that dry waste was being piled up in resource recovery centres. It was then that the corporation had to extend the contract of the agency and despite pending bills; the agency took up the task of transporting the waste from the city. When the BJP persisted with questions and cited lack of clarity in the agenda, an annoyed Jameela Sreedharan replied that everything was very clearly written down in the agenda and those who have doubts may read it carefully. Her remark provoked the BJP councillors who said it was improper of the chairperson to issue such a brusque reply to a genuine question by the councillor. Jameela Sreedharan said the agency has been associating with the civic body for the past four years and that the health team had inspected their facilities before roping them for waste collection. She said they have facilities at Tirunelveli and Nagercoil and that she was not aware of any kind of ban on waste transport to Tamil Nadu, referring to a BJP councillor’s comment that there were restrictions in transportation of waste to the neighbouring state. Unlike previous years, the city corporation received quotes from two firms for around 18 kinds of dry waste this time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/corp-nod-for-agencies-collecting-dry-waste/articleshow/86211686.cms||---

The gold was offered by Ganpat Lal Anjana, a businessman of Choti Sadri in 1965. The gold was under the custody of Udaipur collector for almost 38 years.The gold was deposited by Anjana to the then collector of Chittorgarh under the Gold Bond Scheme and a receipt for the same was availed.When the gold was deposited in the collectorate, its weight was 56.863 kilogram and the value was around Rs 5 lakh. When the gold was weighed for shifting on Monday, it was found to be 67.800kg, valuing around Rs 32 crore.The CGST team had reached Udaipur to collect the gold. On Monday midnight, the team left for Delhi with 64.600kg of gold jewellery and gold biscuits. The remaining 3.2kg of gold has been retained in the warehouse because of some discrepancy in the engraved words on gold biscuits and the words mentioned in the documents.When Shastri's visit got cancelled, the gold was deposited with the Chittorgarh collector. In 1969, a person named Gunwant filed a case against Ganpat and Heeralal demanding that if the gold has not reached Lal Bahadur Shastri it should be returned to the public. The ACJM court on in its decision on 11 January 1975, had ordered to hand over the gold to CGST.In 1982, this gold was shifted from Chittorgarh to Udaipur collectorate. In compliance with the order of the Udaipur ACJM Court, the ADJ-1 court ruled in favour of GSTC. The gold was to be handed over on September 14, 2007, but could not be delivered because of some issues. In 2020 again, the CGST lawyer filed a petition in the Udaipur Court. There was an error by the CGST in writing the exact quantity of gold so without mentioning the quantity of gold and considering it a human error, the court ordered the handing over of entire gold to CGST.On Monday, the gold was weighed for handing over to CGST which turned out to be more than the quantity mentioned in the document.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/65kg-gold-donated-to-weigh-ex-pm-shastri-goes-to-centre/articleshow/86215925.cms||---

Tera Software MD Tummala Gopichand, who was also summoned for questioning, did not turn up. Prasad and Rao appeared before the investigating officer around 11 in the morning and were questioned for two hours. A total of 18 persons have been named in the FIR filed by the CID on September 9, which states that Prasad, who was the appointed member of tender evaluation, colluded with Gopichand and illegally handed over the tender valued at Rs 321 crore pertaining to AP Fibernet to the company. A report submitted by the CID to the court suggests that the accused accepted faulty and falsified documentation given by a consortium led by Tera Software. Hari Prasad later told reporters said all accusations against him are false. “I was not asked anything about the case. The CID said they will summon me again.

The injured are undergoing treatment in the government medical college and hospital in Dharmapuri. The Thoppur police identified the deceased as Rathinavelu, 30, of Edamalai in Trichy district, and truck driver Siddhaiyan, 49, of Ettimangkurichi village in Salem district. A police officer said the accident occurred when 12 staff members of a sewage suction truck were attending to a technical snag that their vehicle developed at Thoppur check post, where it was stopped on roadside, around 11pm on Monday. The truck, the officer said, was heading to Trichy from Dharmapuri. “Suddenly, a truck that was transporting potatoes to Avinashi in Tirupur district from Gujarat rammed the stationary vehicle and toppled. Another truck laden with boulders hit the potato-laden truck, while a container truck hit the former from behind. In the impact of the multiple collision, the sewage suction truck and the potato-laden truck fell into a roadside pit,” said district superintendent of police C Kalaichelvan, who visited the spot the same night along with Salem range DIG S Maheshwari. He said the truck laden with boulders was heading to Palani in Dindigul district from Krishnagiri. “Details of the container truck are not known as the driver fled after the incident.” Rathinavel, a member of the sewage suction truck team, and Siddhaiyan, driver of the potato-laden truck, succumbed to their injuries on the spot. Among the injured were 11 members of the sewage suction truck team, three people in the boulder-laden truck and the second driver (Pradhap, 30, of Thathanur in Salem) of the potato-laden truck who lost both his legs. When alerted, the Thoppur police rescued the injured and took them to the government medical college and hospital, where their condition is said to be stable. Police personnel, along with Palayam toll gate staff, removed the vehicles involved in the collision from the stretch, where traffic came to a halt for nearly three hours, and restored the vehicular movement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/salem/2-killed-in-collision-involving-4-trucks/articleshow/86214223.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Convalescent plasma therapy may do more harm than good: Study||MUMBAI: A study led by Canadian researchers has proved what was feared all along by many Indian medical experts: convalescent plasma therapy may do more harm than good. Nearly 36,000 people in the state are believed to have been treated with convalescent plasma through the two Covid waves. Pune division saw the highest use, followed by Nagpur and Konkan. The CONCOR-1 trial published in Nature Medicine journal found that plasma therapy, one of the most hyped treatments, was ineffective in reducing the risk of intubation (going on ventilator) or death. Worse, recipients of the blood product (33%) had significantly more serious adverse events, including increased oxygen requirement and respiratory failure, than those who got standard care (26.4%). Intubation or death occurred among 32.4% patients treated with plasma, over 28% who did not get it. The other crucial learning was that variable antibody levels in patients and plasma donors affected the treatment response. “Plasma found to have either low or non-functioning antibody levels was associated with a greater risk of intubation or death,” the study found. The “poor” antibodies in plasma may compete with a patient’s functioning antibodies to derail the immune response, the researchers believed. “It has been thought that the blood plasma of Covid-19 survivors would help those seriously ill from the virus but, unfortunately, it does not,” Donald Arnold, a professor at McMaster University in Canada and co-principal investigator of the study, told PTI. Demand for plasma touched the skies during the first wave as patients shelled out up to Rs 60,000 for a single unit. The euphoria subsided when the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) revealed last year its trial findings that plasma was not that effective. But it didn’t disappear as the private sector continued its indiscriminate use. ICMR removed it from its treatment protocols only this May. Maharashtra announced its own trial, Platina project, on 150 critical patients as well as for distribution of plasma for emergency use. It was stopped in January as it was found to be detrimental, said Dr Mohammed Faisal, nodal officer, adding that the findings will be published. According to the Maharashtra FDA, 34,874 units of plasma were distributed across districts. A total of 19,631 people had donated 36,246 bags of plasma. Since the ICMR removed it from treatment protocol, they have stopped keeping records, said an official. The state has no data on deaths caused by adverse events of plasma. Dr Vasant Nagvekar, a member of the state Covid task force, said with monoclonal antibodies, the use of plasma has almost stopped.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/plasma-may-do-more-harm-than-good-in-mumbai-study/articleshow/86214417.cms||Sumitra Debroy

The HC bench of Justices S S Shinde and N J Jamadar recorded the statement by the public prosecutor made on instructions from the state and posted the petition for final hearing to September 27. Advocate Surendra Gadling and writer and activist Sudhir Dhavale, accused in the Elgar Parishad case, had through their advocate S B Talekar challenged the January 24, 2020 order issued by the Union home ministry for handing over the probe to the NIA. The petition said that under the NIA Act, a decision to transfer investigation to the central agency was required to be taken within 15 days of the state informing the Centre that it is investigating the accused for terror offences under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). The petition said the state had informed the Centre “sometime in July 2018” and the “fact that no such decision was taken within 15 days, the Centre ceased to have power to direct NIA to investigate”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/wont-file-any-affidavit-to-plea-by-2-elgar-accused-in-mumbai-state/articleshow/86215987.cms||---

However, these are not utilised to their maximum capacity. To clean the industrial waste flowing into the Yamuna, all the available resources must be utilised to their maximum capacity and all departments must work and achieve their individual target within three years,” said Jain.The water minister directed DSIIDC officials to connect all stormwater drains carrying industrial waste to the existing common effluent treatment plants.Officials said the issue of discharge of industrial waste into the stormwater drains by industries was also discussed in the meeting, for which the minister said that industries polluting the river needed to be identified.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/jain-ensure-no-untreated-waste-flows-into-yamuna/articleshow/86211708.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Cop focus on Bypass before Metro work||Kolkata: Reopening of offices has led to a surge in traffic volume on Maa flyover and is affecting traffic movement at Mathpukur and Metropolitan crossing on EM Bypass. These will have a bearing on the traffic movement plans for the Metro work at the Chingrighata crossing. According to police sources, the per minute traffic volume discharge at the Metropolitan end of Maa flyover during office hours is now almost back to the pre-Covid times. “We had 342-372 vehicles per minute in 2019 on this stretch. At present, the numbers are between 280-320 vehicles per minute,” said a traffic police source. The rising numbers have led Kolkata traffic police to allow a 9-minute uninterrupted traffic cycle for the north-south movement on EM Bypass. The decision would mean that the traffic signal at Metropolitan will be used only for pedestrian movement. “In the pre-Covid times, we had decided not to allow vehicles from the Ultadanga side of Bypass and a right turn towards Tangra at Metropolitan crossing for four hours (two hours each in the peak period). These vehicles had to take a U-turn from Mathpukur. Now, those hoping to take a right from Tangra will have to wait for nine minutes before being allowed the turn. We do understand that hundreds of residents — in the new apartment blocks face inconvenience. But this is the only way we can manage traffic at this important stretch. We will strictly adhere to this from now on,” said an officer. The police have also decided that they will try and synchronize a few traffic signals on the Bypass. “Ideally, we would have liked to synchronize our system with the one at D L Khan Road-AJC Bose road Crossing when vehicles are taking the AJC Bose road flyover. However, since that is impractical, we can at least ensure that all signals between Science City and Kadapara work in tandem. While this too has been in place for the past few years, we might be calibrating the timings to try and accommodate the office rush,” said an officer. The police said a number of long term proposals to decongest this part of EM Bypass are up for discussion with both KMDA and RVNL and they will be announced once a decision is taken. “We might need two signals operating in tandem — one near Chingrighata Bridge approach (while travelling towards Ultadanga) and the other that is presently operating at the crossing. All vehicles coming in from Science City side and moving towards Ultadanga will have to take an acute left once Metro blocks out the centre of Bypass for construction. Even if we curve out the same road width from the police guard area as the existing one, the holding capacity will go down. Hence, we need to regulate vehicles right from Captain Bhery,” explained a Beliaghata traffic guard officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cop-focus-on-bypass-before-metro-work/articleshow/86211715.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Almost 90% of the eligible population in the state who have been vaccinated have received Covishield. The study shows that patients who were inoculated between 10-14 weeks gap had more than three times immune response in comparison with those who received two jabs between a shorter gap of 4-6 weeks. The debate over the ideal gap between the two jabs has been raging on but no studies are yet available from India. Recently, Kerala high court had asked central government to make changes in the CoWIN portal to allow citizens willing to pay for the second dose to choose between an early vaccination to be safe or a late vaccination for better efficacy) . The study conducted by Dr Padmanabha Shenoy, clinical immunologist and rheumatologist, and his team at CARE Hospital, Kochi, focussed on patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases. As many as 213 patients were selected for the study. Till May, the interval between the two doses was 4-6 weeks and 102 patients who received both the doses during the said period were selected. Another 111 patients who were inoculated after a policy change at an interval of 10-12 weeks were also included in the study. The anti-spike antibody of both the groups, with mean age being 51 years, was measured after a month of the second dose. “It was found that the patients who took vaccines at an interval of 10-14 weeks acquired about 3.5-fold rise in the antibody levels compared to patients who took vaccine at an interval of 4-6 weeks. Therefore, the longer the gap between two jabs, much better the antibody levels. Higher antibody levels are likely to give higher levels of protection from the disease and immunity is likely to last for a longer time,” said Dr Shenoy.  “However, we don’t know how the immune system would respond if the gap is for 4-8 weeks,” he said. A study conducted in UK also showed similar results. The study is significant for all those eligible for the vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/spacing-out-doses-boosts-antibody-levels-three-fold/articleshow/86211762.cms||Preetu Nair

This has brought an end to the week-long protest by the students and PhD scholars of the department, seeking to continue the programme. The four-year course is being offered at the TNAU’s Forest College and Research Institute at Mettupalayam. The academic council of the university had earlier decided to suspend the course for the next two academic years. It was told that TNAU was looking for an alternative location for the department with a suitable environment for mulberry cultivation and silkworm rearing. Students had been protesting the move for the past seven days. Many farmers’ organizations had extended support to the protest. PMK leader S Ramadoss had on Monday condemned TNAU administration for dropping the programme and urged chief minister M K Stalin and agriculture minister M R K Panneerselvam to intervene and ensure continuance of the programme. After several rounds of talks, a TNAU team led by M Kalyanasundaram, dean, Agricultural College and Research Institute, informed the agitating students about the decision not to discontinue the programme on Tuesday.

---||Kolkata||Snag hits Aadhaar-ration card link, consumers and dealers suffer||Kolkata: Implementation of one nation-one ration card remained bumpy for both the consumers and dealers. The linking of Aadhaar card with ration card, which is a prerequisite for implementation of the system, is getting very tough both for customers and ration dealers. “Linking of Aadhaar with mobile and that with the ration card is facing a huge challenge at ration shops across the state. Server errors are resulting in long queues in front of the ration shops across the city, with people agitating over the fear of losing monthly ration if the link is not established,” said Biswambhar Basu, general secretary, All India Fair Price Shop Dealers Federation. After scanning digital ration cards (DRCs) in the e-POS, it is taking a lot of time to move on to the next level. But even after all the hard work, the e-POS is displaying ‘invalid response’ from the server and ‘time out’ notice. Such repeated attempts are taking 20-25 minutes for each customer, said Basu. Such issues are leading to unpleasant situations while trying Aadhaar seeding or authentication and mobile seeding for digital ration cards (DRCs). “Consumers are facing the problem and we are bearing the brunt,” said Gour Basak, a ration dealer. Even during the ration delivery, we are faltering at every step. Use of biometric or by OTP, the direct beneficiary identification is failing at times. Even after attempting OTP, it is not getting reflected on the mobile of the beneficiary. Sometimes, the cardholder’s mobile is receiving the OTP long after the statutory time of 60 seconds. Even if the OTP reaches the mobile of the beneficiary on time, verification of the OTP is not successful, said Basu. Following such lengthy process of scanning, “error 300 and error 993” followed by “beneficiary identification failure’’ are reportedly occurring. “The entire transaction has to be repeated all over again. It is taking 30-40 minutes to complete a single transaction. In some cases even after taking time for hours, a transaction cannot be completed and there are numerous examples of such hazards,” said Basu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/snag-hits-aadhaar-ration-card-link-consumers-and-dealers-suffer/articleshow/86211769.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

The coaching centres are, in turn, charging anywhere between Rs 20,000 and Rs 30,000 for the two-month crash course, including study materials. “Usually, exams are conducted three to four months from the date of issuing the notification. But this time, we have just two months to prepare for the exam, which is scheduled for November. While the questions will be from the curriculum that we teach daily, we need dedicated training to attempt difficult and tricky questions,” said K Vanaja, one of the job aspirants. She is a commerce teacher with a private school in the district. Aranga Gopal, director, Shibi IAS Academy, said they had started receiving enquiries well ahead of the notification. “Candidates are ready to join us and we may start the coaching classes in a few days. It will be a challenging task for both the candidates and coaching centres. If the exam was scheduled during the summer, as it mostly happens, candidates could have got time to prepare well. As a coaching centre, we bring experienced teachers from colleges and schools who are now busy with classes.” Manager of another coaching centre at Gandhipuram said they were planning to start early morning and evening classes for the candidates. “Fortunately, the lockdown norms are relaxed and candidates can come for physical classes before and after the school hours.” Some of the experienced government school and college teachers have also started taking evening classes at their houses for the job aspirants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/coaching-centres-cash-in-on-teachers-recruitment-board-exam/articleshow/86214278.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kochi||Pandemic out, lifestyle diseases in?||Kochi: As the country observes September as a nutrition month to mark its fight against malnutrition, the pandemic period is likely to produce a whole lot of population with severe lifestyle diseases with many likely to become overweight or underweight, say dieticians. “We have been getting calls from people who say that they have dramatically gained weight---up to nearly 10kg----in the last one year,” said Dr Mumtaz Khalid Ismail, president, Association for Evidence-based Dietetics and Nutrition- Kerala. Last year, even as people stopped eating outside, they just plunged into home-based cooking and baking. The sale of home-made food rose sharply and it was mostly bingeing and no-exercise. “There has been a rise in the number of social-media cooking channels and everybody has been getting into cooking,” At the same time, she says patients who are underweight have also been coming to see them and that they are mostly in their early 20s. “We have been noting severe deficiencies in their diets too,” she said. To reach out to the public as part of the National Nutrition Month, the association has launched a campaign to create awareness among the public about healthy diet. “We are giving 50 individualized diet consultations. Dietitians all over Kerala are joining hands to create awareness among the public. The campaign has been launched through social media under the Eat Right Campaign,” she said. According to nutritionists, most people have been having high carb diet and drinking all kinds of so-called health drinks without balancing it with proteins and vitamins. There has been a trend for more home cooked fried foods in the last year and the effects of that imbalanced diet is showing on the body this year. If this continues, I’m afraid we will be fighting more lifestyle diseases that will rival Covid-19 in its spread by next year,” Dr Mumtaz said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/pandemic-out-lifestyle-diseases-in/articleshow/86211823.cms||Sudha Nambudiri

Shanavas alias Shanu residing near CRPF camp at Pallippuram is the individual who has committed the alleged crime. The Mangalapuram police have registered a case and launched a search to arrest him. The police said the incident related to the case took place on Monday night around 8 pm. He turned up at the Travancore Bakery shop at Pallippuram and threatened to harm the owner and his wife, brandishing a knife. He then went on to terrorise other traders in the locality. He entered the mobile phone recharge shop nearby and threatened the owner of that shop too. He also roughed up a young guest labourer who was in the shop at that time and injured him using the knife. The injury was not serious in nature, the police said. It was in April this year that Shanavas critically injured the owner of Travancore Bakery without any apparent provocation. He went absconding after the crime and was arrested two months later. But, he was released on bail within a few weeks. After getting bail he did not return to Pallippuram for several weeks. It was only two days ago he returned home. On Monday night, he turned up at the bakery with an intention to intimidate the complainant against him, the police said.  Besides arresting him again, police were also planning to invoke provisions of KAAPA against him.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/goon-out-on-bail-attacks-guest-labourer/articleshow/86211804.cms||---

It is the responsibility of the central government to purchase rice. Isn’t Telangana a part of India,” he asked.  He said paddy is being cultivated in 55 lakh acres in the state in the present Vanakalam season and 1.40 crore metric tonnes of yield is expected. Of that, FCI is willing to purchase only 60 lakh metric tonnes. What about the remaining 80 lakh metric tonnes, he said.

---||Coimbatore||Bid to upgrade town panchayats in district draw voices of dissent||Coimbatore: Some village panchayat representatives raised objection to upgrade four town panchayats to municipalities in the district during a public hearing meeting held at the collectorate on Tuesday. The meeting was chaired by collector GS Sameeran. There are 37 town panchayats in the district. The state government has planned to upgrade four town panchayats – Karumathampatti, Karamadai, Gudalur and Madukkarai – to municipalities. “If the four town panchayats are upgraded to municipalities, many village panchayats will be brought under the municipalities. Once the village panchayat areas will be merged with the municipalities, the property tax rates will increase many-fold. Prices of properties will also increase, thereby making it difficult for locals to buy lands,” one of the panchayat representatives said in the meeting. Another representative said, “If the village panchayats are merged with the municipalities, we will lose work under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act schemes. People won’t get benefit from the Green House Scheme.” While some representatives said they have decided to pass a resolution to merge their areas with the municipalities, a few said they would pass resolutions against the government move. Collector Sameeran said the state government decided to upgrade the four town panchayats to municipalities based on the revenue of the town panchayats, population and other factors. Coimbatore MP PR Natarajan, AIADMK MLAs AK Selvaraj, VP Kandasamy and Amul Kandasamy participated in the meeting. The second public hearing will be held at the four town panchayat offices on September 18.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/bid-to-upgrade-town-panchayats-in-district-draw-voices-of-dissent/articleshow/86214347.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Delhi||‘Readying plan to clean sources that dirty Yamuna’||New Delhi: Delhi government is planning to treat around 155 million gallons per day (MGD) of wastewater coming from Haryana and Uttar Pradesh into the Yamuna, said water minister Satyendar Jain. He held a meeting with officials from Delhi Jal Board and the Irrigation and Flood Control department on Wednesday and said the government was laying down a master plan to clean all the sources that pollute the river. Jain said drains from both the states would either be diverted to sewage treatment plants (STPs) in Delhi or undergo in situ treatment. The treated water will be further used to revive lakes and waterbodies and the rest will be discharged into the Yamuna. The Yamuna receives 105 MGD of wastewater from Haryana and around 50 MGD of wastewater from Uttar Pradesh. The 105 MGD of Haryana’s flow largely comes through two major drains— the Badshahpur drain coming from Gurgaon and Drain number-6 from Sonipat. Similarly, the 50 MGD of wastewater from Uttar Pradesh enters into the river in Delhi via the Ghazipur drain. Jain said the Yamuna did not belong to a particular state but to the whole country, and to achieve the target of cleaning the river, the government would do whatever is needed. “The Yamuna is a holy river. It’s a river that we all pray to and seek blessings. It does not belong to a particular state but to the whole country. It belongs to every citizen of the country. The states that are polluting the river should also take steps to clean it, but we are taking additional responsibility upon ourselves because it is our commitment to the citizens of Delhi that we will clean it within three years,” said Jain. The minister said this additional work would be done at the expense of Delhi government. “Wastewater is a resource that can solve water problems of any city when handled properly,” he said, stating DJB had already taken a few steps in this direction. “Drain number-6 is carrying around 15 MGD of water, out of which the major flow has been tapped through the barrage and diverted to the Narela STP, which is currently treating around 12 MGD against a design capacity of 10 MGD. Pipelines are being laid to carry treated water to various lakes, waterbodies, tanks and green areas of the Narela area for rejuvenation and recharging purposes,” he added. For tapping wastewater from Ghazipur drain, barrage work to take it to Kondli STP has also been completed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/readying-plan-to-clean-sources-that-dirty-yamuna/articleshow/86245195.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Goa||Karuna’s residential football academy for underprivileged girls in Goa has big dreams||Panaji: Kennedy D’Silva has to pinch himself to confirm that his dream of a residential girls football academy is now a reality. A former footballer and champion athlete, D’Silva has undertaken several challenging tasks in his life. He once walked from Mangaluru to Goa, covering a distance of 410 kms in five days. During the pandemic, he covered 2000 kms in 96 days and led a 74 km peace walk from Mollem to Vasco. On the organisational front, with little in hand, he galvanised everyone to host the Expo Unity World Cup in 2014 as amateur teams from Brazil, Portugal, Colombia, Ghana and Nigeria travelled to Goa. The National Residential Girls Football Academy, though, is the most ambitious project launched by the Karuna Football Foundation. “We always wanted to see girls playing football in rural Goa. It’s such a beautiful sight to see girls running across open fields chasing a ball, scoring goals and loudly cheering,” said D’Silva, who heads the foundation. Through the foundation, D’Silva had started Compassion FC, a team that got its players from organisations and shelters that deal with orphans, single parents and children from slums and streets. They took part in age-group tournaments and made good progress. Early this year, Compassion FC fielded a women’s team. Now they have an academy of its own at the Holy Rosary Convent High School in Nuvem “The foundation has stepped forward to take the game to the marginalised and underprivileged girls from orphanages, streets and slums,” said D’Silva. Scouts working with the underprivileged and marginalised communities have handpicked players from across the country. There are five from Manipur, three from Tamil Nadu, one each from Kerala and Maharashtra, while 14 are from Goa itself. “They are all here on merit. The academy is providing the girls from economically backward backgrounds with an all-round education. Not just football, they will be trained in life skills and vocational training for jobs in the future,” said D’Silva. The foundation for the academy has been laid by Heidi Scheunemann, holder of DFB-B-license from Germany. She has been working for the last 25 years in Indonesia and has produced several internationals. Mario Aguiar, goalkeeping coach for the Indian team at the Fifa U-17 World Cup 2017, has been appointed as the head coach, while former India captain Maria Rebello and Naomi Vase (formerly Dempo SC) are also part of the coaching staff. “The academy is now up and running,” said D’Silva. “This is something that I always wanted to do for the girls, but there is no doubt we need support from every quarter. I am sure there will be well-wishers who will step in to help.” VM Prabhu Desai, executive director of the Sports Authority of Goa (SAG), was the first to offer all possible help. SAG coaches – Aguiar and Rebello – have been allowed to work here, while physiotherapist, nutritionist, equipment and use of the artificial-turf ground at Fatorda is on the to-do list. Goa Football Development Council (GFDC) chairman Brahmanand Shankhwalkar and AIFF technical director Savio Medeira also attended the launch, while former internationals Yolanda de Sousa, Juliana Gurjao, Succorinha Pereira, Ritinha Pereira and Maria Rebello were felicitated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/karunas-residential-football-academy-for-underprivileged-girls-in-goa-has-big-dreams/articleshow/86242859.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

---||Dehradun||Tourist footfall down to a 5th in 2 yrs, U’khand banks on winter tourism for revival||Dehradun: To deal with a sharp decline in tourism – the mainstay of Uttarakhand’s economy – during the pandemic, the state government is now banking on winter sports and lesser-explored locales for a revival. It also plans on offering incentives on hotel bookings and organising events at popular hill stations, like Mussoorie and Nainital. In 2017, Uttarakhand received a total of 3.5 crore tourists, 3.7 crore in 2018 and 3.9 crore in 2019. After that, the pandemic struck and the number slid to 78.4 lakh in 2020, a little more than a fifth of the previous year’s figure, plunging thousands into financial uncertainty. The situation saw a slight improvement this year, with 90 lakh tourists having visited the state in 2021 (till June), but a lion’s share of that contributed by the Haridwar Maha Kumbh (April 1 - 30), when around 75 lakh devotees visited Haridwar, most flouted the Covid-19 guidelines, and caused the pandemic to spiral out of control in the district and the rest of the state. With the prospect of opening the Char Dham Yatra looking bleak (Uttarakhand HC has put a stay on it and the yatra closes for the winter in early November), the state now plans to throw its weight behind winter sports, especially the Auli Winter Games, which mostly includes skiing and is held at the fag-end of winter when the Garhwal Himalayas are covered in snow. “Covid-19 cases have gone down in Uttarakhand. While we remain alert, if the situation stays like this, we plan to promote winter tourism in the state,” tourism minister Satpal Maharaj told TOI. As for the Char Dham Yatra, Maharaj said that the four shrines – Kedarnath, Badrinath, Gangotri and Yamunotri – are closed to devotees during Diwali and are usually closed for winter during early November. However, if the HC lifts its stay on the yatra, devotees can still visit the temples for a month. “Granted the peak time of Char Dham yatra will have passed, but we would still have a month if the HC lifts its stay on the annual pilgrimage. We will follow all norms as directed by the court if the yatra is allowed to be conducted,” he said. The Char Dham Yatra, the annual six-month pilgrimage in Uttarakhand, is usually the backbone of the state’s economy. Not only the tourism department, but tour operators and other stakeholders in the yatra also suffered a heavy blow when it was delayed last year and disallowed this year. In 2017, 21.9 lakh devotees took the Char Dham Yatra, 26.2 lakh went on the pilgrimage in 2018 and a record 32.4 lakh pilgrims visited Char Dham in 2019. In 2020, when the pilgrimage started past its peak time, only 3.2 lakh devotees came. Besides, the Kailash-Mansarovar Yatra and the Adi Kailash trek, taken by around 1,000 tourists every year, has not been held for two years now. Maharaj added that even once the Char Dham shrines are closed, several other temples would be open for devotees and the state would promote those. “We will promote these locations on a national level and it will definitely draw devotees to Uttarakhand,” he said. The state now also plans to offer incentives on hotel bookings, spread awareness and offer discount packages for lesser-explored locations like Chakrata and Almora, apart from planning events like carnivals at go-to hill stations like Mussoorie and Nainital. Speaking to TOI, additional director, tourism, Vivek Singh Chauhan said, “Most tourists rush straight to Mussoorie or Nainital. However, lesser-known places like Chakrata, some obscure places in Garhwal and Kumaon, can also draw tourists in big numbers. Take Auli, for instance. It can draw a huge number of adventure sports enthusiasts. We plan to spread information and awareness about these locations.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/tourist-footfall-down-to-a-5th-in-2-yrs-ukhand-banks-on-winter-tourism-for-revival/articleshow/86209789.cms||Kautilya Singh

Akhtar, in his article, said ‘Hindus were the most decent and tolerant majority in the world. Akhtar said India could never become Afghanistan as it is naturally not fundamentalist. Last week, the Sena in its editorial in ‘Saamana’, headlined, “There would be differences with respect to Sangh…yet…” slammed Akhtar and said “linking Hindutva with the Taliban is disrespectful to Hindu culture.” “In my recent interview, I had said Hindus are the most decent and tolerant majority in the world. I have also emphasised that India can never become like Afghanistan because Indians by nature are not extremists. It is in their DNA to be moderate, to be in the middle of the road,” Akhtar wrote. Akhtar said those who were hitting out at him were angry as they found similarities between the mindset of the Taliban and the Hindu right-wing. “While the Taliban is forming an Islamic government based on religion, the Hindu right-wing wants a Hindu Rashtra. The Taliban wants to curb women’s rights. The right wing here has also made it clear that they don’t like the freedom of women,” Akhtar wrote. Akhtar, however, was all praise for CM Uddhav Thackeray. “Not even worst of critics can accuse him (Uddhav Thackeray) of any discrimination or injustice. It is beyond my understanding how and why anyone can call Uddhav Thackeray’s government ‘talibani’, Akhtar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hindus-most-tolerant-says-javed-akhtar-in-saamna/articleshow/86216005.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh high court pulls up officials for going soft on illegal sand mining||VIJAYAWADA: The high court on Tuesday pulled up officials for not acting against illegal mining in the state. Hearing a petition challenging the inaction of officials against indiscriminate sand mining from island lands at Kedari Lanka and Bollanka villages in East Godavari district, Justice U Durga Prasad Rao said officials do not seem bothered. “They go to sleep after giving temporary permission and do not bother to check indiscriminate illegal mining. Even after finding irregularities, they are imposing only nominal fines. They have the power to impose fines up to five times of the damage caused apart from filing criminal cases, but they are hardly exercising their powers,” he observed. B Dhanaraj and two others moved the high court over illegal mining activity in the ecologically sensitive island lands in Godavari river, alleging that in the name of levelling lands allotted for house sites, illegal mining of sand and blunt clay, which act as protective shields for agriculture lands, is continuing on the island lands due to which the course of the river is being altered, resulting in corrosion of agriculture lands. When the court sought a reply from the mining department, the assistant government pleader for mining said temporary permission was given for mining on the island lands. Taking a serious note of his reply, Justice Rao said the action of officials against illegal mining should be like a snake bite rather than mosquito bite and asked them to act strictly against illegal mining by exercising all their powers. When the court sought a reply from the mining department, the assistant government pleader for mining said temporary permission was given for mining on the island lands.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Repair drive on campuses with eye on reopening||KOLKATA: Colleges and universities in the city have started cleaning, repairing and renovating their campuses, including classrooms, laboratories and other facilities, most of which have been lying unused since March last year, when all educational institutes were shut down when the pandemic broke out. From overhauling electrical wiring and appliances to repairing classrooms, stairs and washrooms to painting corridors, campuses are undergoing largescale revamp following the chief minister’s hint that educational institutes might reopen after the Pujas if Covid cases remained under check. The authorities said repairs had become necessary as the places had not been used for over 18 months and hardly any maintenance work had been carried out. They pointed out the scramble for renovation was to ensure that the buildings were ready to welcome students and teachers back, if permitted. Many principals said the higher education department had sought a report on the condition of campuses and verbally conveyed to them to carry out repairs. Jadavpur University has set a target of 45 days to repair the English department classes and 25 days for civil engineering classes. The teachers’ association at the university wrote to the education minister last week, drawing his attention to equipment, worth hundreds of crores, gathering dust. “Notices have been sent to departmental heads for an audit after the emergency EC meeting last week regarding campus reopening. They will get back with other requirements,” said a JU official. Calcutta University has also initiated maintenance work at almost all its campuses across the city, including restoration of a server in the Centenary Building on College Street, repair of classrooms and toilets at Rajabazar Science College and electric wire overhaul at Ballygunge Science College. “The campuses have been shut for 18 months. Two cyclones and torrential rain have damaged the infrastructure. Faults have appeared in wiring and several electrical gadgets have not been used,” said an official of the CU estate department. Scottish Church College is strengthening the brick arch ceiling and other parts of the main building. St Paul’s Cathedral Mission is repairing the toilets in Jani Ali Building. Other colleges, like Jaipuria, Maulana Azad and Asutosh, too, are carrying out repairs. “The education department has told us to prepare a report on the condition of the buildings and initiate repairs so that whenever campuses are reopened, there should not be any safety risk to anybody,” said a principal of a north Kolkata college.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/campuses-train-eyes-on-reopen-launch-repairs/articleshow/86211878.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Delhi||Jain: 47k flats for poor to be used under central plan||New Delhi: Urban development minister Satyendar Jain on Wednesday said Delhi government was constructing 47,511 flats to relocate slum dwellers but the Centre ordered that all these houses would now have to be given under the ‘Affordable Rental Housing Scheme’ (ARHS) and not to them. At a press conference, Jain said many of these flats were ready and others were being constructed. He added that, of the total houses, many government departments and agencies had already given relocation charges for 9,104 flats, however, partial payments were made for these flats, which were to be allotted soon. “A few days ago, we received a letter from the central government that all 47,511 houses are to be used for affordable rental housing scheme only,” Jain said. The minister added that Delhi government would have to construct houses from the scratch for the slum dwellers. He claimed that Delhi Development Authority, too, had asked for 9,535 units to relocate slum dwellers from land under its jurisdiction, but the Centre had said no to this as well, and these housing units were to be under affordable rental housing scheme. ARHS is aimed at providing affordable housing for the urban poor and migrant population from economically weaker sections and lower-income group categories. The housing will be rental and in the shape of one or two-bedroom dwelling units and dormitory of four to six beds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/jain-47k-flats-for-poor-to-be-used-under-central-plan/articleshow/86245263.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Hyderabad||Telangana in the soup as FCI nixes buying rice||HYDERABAD: With the Food Corporation of India (FCI) deciding not to purchase coarse rice from Telangana, the state government faces a significant challenge in initiating a change in cultivating pattern as the country’s largest producer of coarse rice (approximately 1.5 crore tones) for two seasons, the state has the largest number of farmers (21 lakh) benefiting from minimum support price (MSP) rice. The government has been asking for additional paddy from the Union government. Farmers are facing a challenge in selling the coarse variety of paddy while there is little clarity on the non-local market, as the reliance of neighbouring states on imports from Telangana is decreasing. Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka, which used to import rice from Telangana, have seen a rise in local paddy cultivation. Local traders are also buying rice from states such as Uttar Pradesh and Chattisgarh, which have lower MSPs than Telangana. Officials said, “Our farmers are losing market share on these two accounts. The export market outside is also limited when compared to production.” According to experts, modifying the cultivation pattern will be a difficult task, and the state administration is considering numerous possibilities. According to Professor Jayashankar Telangana Agriculture University (PJTAU), cropping should be done in an alternate pattern. “Many states rotate crops each season, and after cereals, pulses will be sown. We need to adopt this strategy, because there is more production than demand, and paddy cultivation has an ecological impact,” PJTAU vicechancellor Dr Pravin Rao said. Agriculture scientist GV Ramanejaneyulu believes that the state should offer farmers robust support mechanisms to encourage them to grow other crops. “It was not the proper method to encourage paddy and cotton despite the availability of water resources. If other crops are also supported, even if not with a minimum support price, the cultivation pattern will change,” he says. Centre biased against Telangana in rice procurement: Civil supplies ministerCivil supplies minister Gangula Kamalakar on Tuesday charged the Centre with discriminating against Telangana in procurement of boiled rice. “The Centre had procured 1.13 crore metric tonnes of boiled rice from Punjab in the Yasangi season but is saying that only 25 lakh metric tonnes would be purchased from Telangana. It is the responsibility of the central government to purchase rice. Isn’t Telangana a part of India,” he asked. He said paddy is being cultivated in 55 lakh acres in the state in the present Vanakalam season and 1.40 crore metric tonnes of yield is expected. Of that, FCI is willing to purchase only 60 lakh metric tonnes. What about the remaining 80 lakh metric tonnes, he said. The minister requested Union minister G Kishan Reddy and BJP state president Bandi Sanjay Kumar to prevail upon the BJP government at the Centre to procure the entire crop in the interest of the farmers of Telangana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-in-the-soup-as-fci-nixes-buying-rice/articleshow/86216003.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

The matter will be heard on September 20. Ranaut’s lawyer Rizwan Siddiqui moved a plea citing her ill health. He told court she had Covid-like symptoms and was to undergo a test. The lawyer said she travelled over the last fortnight and had met people during promotions of her latest film. The medical certificate was issued by a doctor who has been cited as a witness by Akhtar’s defence. He said in the past the court was also not working on a few of the court dates. Akhtar and wife, actor Shabana Azmi were in court. His lawyer Jay Bhanushali sought issuance of a non-bailable warrant against Ranaut, telling the court that so far she had not appeared even once. He said Akhtar diligently attended almost all hearings. The lawyer said the summons were issued eight months ago and she was granted exemption even when shooting in Europe. The court kept the plea pending until the next date. Submitted in November through advocate Niranjan Mundargi, Akhtar’s plea had said he was shocked when he learnt on July 19, 2020, that Ranaut had given an interview to Arnab Goswami of Republic TV and Republic Bharat, damaging his “immaculate reputation by falsely attributing statements to him”. The plea said during the 57-minute interview Ranaut gave her opinions on circumstances around actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death without appearing to have direct knowledge of it. The plea said she referred to Akhtar as being part of a “suicide gang”. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaiwarrant-if-ranaut-fails-to-appear-in-akhtar-case/articleshow/86216047.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Retired SI beats up RTI activist, mother||Kollam: A five member gang led by a retired police sub-inspector on Tuesday trespassed in to the house of an RTI activist and beat up him and his mother at Karuangappally. Ammini Amma, 61, and her son Sreekumar, 41, a RTI activist, of Kunnelputhenveettil, Kallelibhagom, Karunagappally, were injured in the attack and are currently admitted to the Taluk hospital. The five member gang, including a retired SI Abdul Rasheed and a woman, barged into the house of Ammini Amma by 8 am and beat up the mother son duo using iron rods. The attack is alleged to be in retaliation of Sreekumar filing a complaint with the police that Abdul Rasheed's son Amal, an advocate, illegally constructed a building in the paddy land he purchased east of the Chavara police station. Following this, the district sub-collector inspected the building and found the construction as illegal and submitted a report to the district collector in this regard. The collector later issued an order to demolish the building. But, Abdul Rasheed's son Amal filed an appeal to the government to review the collector's order. However, the government also upheld the district collector's order. So the attack is alleged to be as revenge against Sreekumar for filing the complaint with the police. Karunagappally police have taken Abdul Rasheed into custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/retired-si-beats-up-rti-activist-mother/articleshow/86211983.cms||---

The transition back to physical classrooms, after nearly five months, will enable students to interact with teachers and among themselves providing them with an opportunity to participate and build social skills. As the education sector grappled with challenges due to Covid-19 pandemic, the British Council had transitioned to online classes and remote working for students and professionals. Speaking on the reopening of the English learning centre, British Council India director of learning services, Antonius Raghubansie said, “The past 18 months have been an adjustment for teachers as well as learners. We know that our learners have missed attending classes in-person. We have gathered regular feedback from our students who felt comfortable to return to our classrooms once again, and to that end, we are implementing strict health and safety protocols on our premises to make our classrooms a safe space for learning.” British Council officials said all safety protocols, including distancing norms were being maintained in the classrooms. While each class accommodated around 20 students earlier, only 10 are being allowed now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/british-council-reopens-teaching-centres-after-five-months/articleshow/86211958.cms||---

Hotels in tourist spots such as Mahabaleshwar and Lonavla have recovered 50-70% of the pre-Covid business, Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India (HRAWI) officials told TOI on Tuesday. Sherry Bhatia, president of the association, said, “This is the first instance of room bookings picking up at these major tourist spots after the second wave began to subside. We anticipate the coming months will bring in more improvement in resort locations.” Hoteliers expect a significant increase in occupancy starting November since there is a chunk of fully vaccinated people in Maharashtra and cases are still in check. “This will boost travellers’ confidence to head out,” he said.  MTDC resorts at these locations have started clocking 90-95% occupancy in the past few weekends, said regional manager Deepak Harane. Poona Hoteliers Association (PHA) president Sharan Shetty said, “Post-Diwali we expect occupancy to increase further with corporate travel picking up. Families have also started enquiring about banquet bookings for weddings.” Travel portal iXigo’s officials said based on trends, flight bookings have crossed 60% of pre-Covid levels with airlines consistently carrying over two lakh passengers every day. “Train travel in India is seeing a faster recovery than flights. Train ticketing now stands at 80% while bus bookings are around 50% of pre-pandemic levels,” said Aloke Bajpai, iXigo co-founder and group CEO. Rajeev Kale, president and country head of Holidays, MICE, Visa for Thomas Cook India, said, “It is back to pre-pandemic levels led by destinations like Leh-Ladakh, Kashmir, Himachal, Rajasthan, Andaman and Goa. Strong demand with positive announcements on reopening of international borders and vaccine acceptance is seeing a surge in travel,” he added.

The Congress also slammed TRS for misusing the police force to place Congress leaders under house arrest and for taking several leaders under preventive custody, including AICC secretary and Dalit leader SA Sampath Kumar on Tuesday, ahead of minister KT Rama Rao’s tour to Jogulamba Gadwal. Telangana Congress campaign committee chairman Madhu Yashki Goud sought to remind all the ministers and TRS leaders that it was chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao who had announced that Telangana state government would procure every grain of paddy produced by the farmers, but has now issued a diktat to them not to go for paddy cultivation than the area prescribed by agriculture extension officers. “KCR, ministers, and TRS leaders are playing with the lives of farmers. The state government should have come out with a clear-cut policy on production of paddy and other variety of crops,” Madhu Yashki Goud said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kcr-playing-with-farmers-lives-goud/articleshow/86216014.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Dehradun||Piped cooking gas supplies start in Haridwar||Haridwar: With the supply of piped cooking gas beginning in Haridwar, a new civic amenity has been added to the city’s list. A joint venture of Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) and Gail Gas Limited, the project was completed during Kumbh 2021. Gail Gas project manager Paranjai Joshi told TOI, “An 830km-long pipeline has been laid and gas supply to around 17,000 consumers has already begun. Work is underway to set up a city gas station at Roorkee. Under this Rs 200 crore Central government project initiated in 2016, four districts including Dehradun, Nainital, Udham Singh Nagar and Haridwar are covered.” “As there was pressure to complete the five-year project before Kumbh 2021, Gail Gas had to work hard to provide gas connection to households in the Kumbh area as well as ashrams and akhadas. Even though we faced difficulties due to Covid-19 situation in the state, we managed to complete the work well in time.” During the 25 years of authorisation that Gail Gas has been given, it hopes to take the number of consumers well beyond 40,000. The number may rise once the project is completed in two other cities, Roorkee and Laksar, of the district. The company is responsible for maintenance as well during its period of authorisation. The project is in the investment phase and will continue to be so for a few years before it yields profit, Joshi said. Former BJP municipal councillor Dinesh Joshi expressed satisfaction with the new facility. Resident of Saptarishi, ward number 1, Ratan Mani Dobhal said, “While gas supply has begun in most of the areas from Ranipur More to Jwalapur including Govindpuri, Vivek Vihar, Model Colony, Khanna Nagar, Arya Nagar, Adarsh Nagar and Ambedkar Nagar, the main Haridwar and Kankhal areas have been left out. However, there is no complaint about gas supply service.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/piped-cooking-gas-supplies-start-in-haridwar/articleshow/86209929.cms||Sheo S Jaiswal

---||Nagpur||Rs249cr allocated for roads, yet no end to potholes in city||Nagpur: Roads in Nagpur are in bad shape. Potholes, craters, ripped off surface, cracks are some of the ‘features’ citizens attribute to the city roads. Moreover, the pathetic condition of roads is a major cause of accidents daily, many of which go unreported. Even after the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) earmarking Rs249.57 crore for roads in the current year’s budget, the condition of roads is worsening with each passing day. According to information obtained from NMC’s accounts and finance department, the civic body earned Rs933 crore in five months of the current fiscal. Of the budgeted provision, Rs153 crore is for cement roads, while only Rs96 crore have been provided for tar roads. However, despite allocation, NMC has not spent the funds for improving road infrastructure. To top it all, rains have caused massive damage to the roads, making them perilous to drive on. The NMC has claimed to have repaired 9,993 potholes so far, with more than 50% between June 1 and August 30, the data revealed. The prolonged spells of rain have created over 5,101 potholes, reveals NMC’s hotmix department data. The data also reveals that the department is yet to repair 2,973 potholes under four zones — Mangalwari (1,847), Ashi Nagar (245), Dhantoli (564) and Hanuman Nagar (317). Numerous potholes have been formed in most of the tar roads across the city, while the bitumen topping has been washed away in several stretches, exposing the poor quality work and maintenance by the civic body. An official from the hotmix department blamed heavy rain for the bad roads. In most cases, black topping of the recently repaired roads too has been washed away due to the rainwater. “The innumerable potholes leave no space to manoeuvre the vehicle. Apart from the physical discomfort to drivers, vehicles also take a beating,” complained motorists, saying not providing pothole-free roads is contempt of the high court, which had taken the NMC to task. Avinash Waghchore, a motorist who had a miraculous escape after his two-wheeler skidded on one such road, claimed he was lucky to escape unhurt after he met with an accident due to loose bitumen on pothole-ridden Rabindranath Tagore Road in Civil Lines. He said though NMC is neglecting potholes, it should at least ensure that loose bitumen is removed from roads. Due to loose bitumen, minor accidents involving two-wheelers have increased manifold, said motorists. “Why aren’t the authorities taking action? Why can’t we have pothole-free roads? How long will the motorists suffer due to the apathy of officials? Will they act only after someone from their family falls victim in a road accident due to poor road condition?” — these were some of the questions raised by road users. Many motorists also pointed out that the problem is not limited to monsoon season. When the rain stops and roads are dry, vehicles kick up heavy dust storm, blinding other motorists on such poorly maintained roads. Congress corporator Kamlesh Chowdhary wondered as to why the NMC was ignoring road repairs even as it earned Rs933 crore revenue. “Despite citizens paying taxes, the ruling BJP is providing them pothole-ridden roads,” he said. Standing committee chairman Prakash Bhoyar admitted condition of city roads has deteriorated. “In the recently concluded general body meeting, mayor Dayashankar Tiwari has directed the administration to repair roads without delay,” he said. During the same meeting, municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B had cited fund crunch. Bhoyar said re-appropriation of various heads will be made to make additional provision for improving city roads.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rs249cr-allocated-for-roads-yet-no-end-to-potholes-in-city/articleshow/86240426.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

---||Rajkot||Gujarat: Five lions ‘de-ported’ from Pipavav let loose in Gir forest||RAJKOT: The forest department which had captured the five lions that were seen roaming in areas of Kovaya near Pipavav port last month were released in the Gir sanctuary. While initially the department said that the wild cats had ben captured for health check up, sources stated that the main intention was to take ‘de-port’ them from the area. The pride that was captured was residing near Pipavav port which falls in Gir east division of the forest department, but were released in Gir west division. In a sudden operation, the forest officials swooped down suddenly on the pride consisting of five female felines and three sub-adults on August 19. Even as lion activists alleged that the wild cats were captured without protocol, the department had always maintained that the cats had been captured for routine medical check ups. According to sources, routine medical check ups on lions are done in the field only and there is no need to capture the animals. After massive hue and cry by the activists, the department released the pride of eight lions in the sanctuary area after five to six days of capturing. However, the officials have continued their status quo on the reason for capture while they are tight-lipped on whether the animals were released from captivity or not. There is no official confirmation, but according to sources, the lions were captured and taken to Jasadhar animal care centre and also releasing them in different territories had come directly from Gandhinagar and the local officers had no say in it. The group had moved to newer areas in search of fresh habitat as the sanctuary area is almost over crowded with lions. Sources also claimed that lion movement in the port area was also posing man-animal conflict risk and that videos going viral in social media of lions venturing freely in the port area created a major embarrassing situation for senior forest officials. D T Vasavada, chief conservator of forest (wildlife circle) told TOI, “There was a threat to the lions’ life in the port area because of the movement of loaded trucks and containers in that area. There were recent incidents in which lions were crushed under the train. It was a decision taken to safeguard animal life.” “They (forest department) just focussed on increasing the numbers of lions. Now when the lion population has increased, they don’t have any clue what to do with them,” alleged lion activist, Mayank Bhatt. He said that this clear shows lack of long-term vision. The activist demanded a new lion conservation management plan which focuses on long term conservation of the grand animal. Around 150 lions prowl in Amreli district alone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/five-lions-de-ported-from-pipavav-let-loose-in-gir-forest/articleshow/86209983.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya
---||Nagpur||Covid hits supply, stamp papers being sold in black||Nagpur: Covid has also left its impact on availability of stamp papers. Needed for signing deeds or filing affidavits, the stamp papers remain in shortage even as the situation has normalized with Covid cases receding. Long queues of the needy can be witnessed at the treasury office near collectorate to buy stamp papers of Rs100 or Rs500 denomination, which are also reported to be fetching heavy premium these days. Black marketers are learnt to be charging almost double the amount. The vendors are blaming district administration for not releasing adequate quantity of stamp papers to meet the demand. Officials, on the other hand, say the shortage began because the India Security Press (ISP) at Nashik did not work from March to September last year due to Covid lockdown. The situation has to be managed with the stock in hand, they say. Even as the ISP work resumed from October 2020, supply remains low. The Nagpur treasury office got a fresh lot only in January this year, followed by another in May. After that, there was a recent supply of stamp papers worth Rs11 crore. However, this has to last for another three months. This means, the rationing may continue. The current supply too is less than the demand. As against 1,000 bundles of Rs100 stamp papers, only 600 have been allotted to Nagpur. A demand was raised for 250 bundles of Rs500 denomination stamp papers, but only 100 were received. The fresh stock can only be supplied to vendors after next 15 days as entire procedure, including recording the number of each stamp paper, has to be completed, said the official in-charge at the collectorate. “Stamp papers are needed for a slew of purposes ranging filing affidavit, signing of any agreement to even applying for government welfare schemes. The situation was worse during the lockdown, but the shortage continues even now,” says Ram Heda, an advocate. The vendors have been fixed a quota of stamp papers worth Rs40,000 twice a week. There are chances that the quota may be increased to Rs1 lakh each, if there is comfortable stock, said the officer. Earlier, there was no quota, and vendors could buy as much as they needed. This left a chance of hoarding. Individual vendors used to fill up challans for stamp papers worth as much as Rs6 lakh in a day. Multiple challans were submitted in a single day. There was also an incident of challan being recorded twice. This could have led to supply of additional stamp paper worth Rs1 lakh without any payment against it. The error was detected in time. This led to the quota system, said a source. There is also a likelihood that huge quantity of stamp papers may be hoarded since the lockdown days. Vendors deny the charge saying there are certain agents outside the premises who may be engaged in black marketing. “We are in a helpless situation. The supply has been curbed to Rs40,000, customers have to wait for hours and return empty handed,” said Satish Patil, president of Vendors’ Association. In the queue stood Ajay Gupta, easily in his sixties, hoping to get a Rs100 stamp paper. He had to submit an affidavit to claim compensation for an acre of his land taken over for an irrigation project.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/covid-hits-supply-stamp-papers-being-sold-in-black/articleshow/86209946.cms||Shishir Arya

Rajnikant Dulera, a peon with the Gandhinagar district panchayat office in Sector-17, went to deliver letters to the old secretariat and then went to the canteen for refreshments, said inspector Dharmendra Chaudhari of Sector-7 police. Rajnikant DuleraChaudhari said that when he went out, it was raining, so he stood under the neem tree outside the canteen in Block Number 11, waiting for the rain to stop.

---||Delhi||HC to govt: Take call on entry to religious sites||New Delhi: Delhi High Court on Tuesday directed Delhi government to take a decision on a representation seeking that visitors to religious places be allowed, subject to strict compliance of Covid-19 protocol.The court said the representation must be decided in accordance with law, rules, regulations and government policy applicable to the case, as expeditiously as possible and practicable.A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh was dealing with a plea by NGO Distress Management Collective that submitted that in view of a “significant drop” in Covid cases, while authorities had permitted the opening of several places, including malls, gyms and spas, there was “selective exclusion” of religious places even in the DDMA’s latest order.“Religious places can open but the public is not allowed... My representation (to allow visitors) was sent 40 days back,” the counsel for the NGO added.“We are giving them a direction to decide the issue,” said the court. As per the plea, “online worship service will never be able to provide the same experience as a physical visit and the continued prohibition on visitors gives an impression that they (the authorities) see religious places solely as places of worship and not a necessity.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-to-govt-take-call-on-entry-to-religious-sites/articleshow/86212099.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ahmedabad||Ahmedabad: Three asphyxiate in Ghatlodia bakery||AHMEDABAD: Three workers, including a minor boy, of a bakery in Ghatlodia died of asphyxiation after an oven remained switched on and created a massive smoke cloud. The tragedy came to light when the owner of the bakery, UKS Food Joint, opened the shutter on Tuesday and found the three on the floor, said an officer of Ghatlodia police. The cops have registered a case of accidental death. The bakery is located in the Gopalnagar locality of Ghatlodia. The owner, Rajeshwari Patel, called police and the 108 ambulance service. Police officers said that the doctor of the ambulance service declared the three dead. The victims have been identified only as Aslam, 21, Ibrahim, 45, and Hasan, 15. The inspector of Ghatlodia police, Yuvrajsinh Vaghela, said the victims did not have any documents and hence their full names and addresses are not yet known. “We came to know from the locals that the victims had come to the city from Uttar Pradesh only 15 days ago when the bakery was inaugurated,” said Vaghela. A local corporator, Jatin Patel, said that the workers died due to smoke inhalation. “There was neither a short circuit nor a fire. Keeping the oven switched on generated smoke and took their lives,” said Patel. As for any negligence on the part of the owner, Vaghela said: “We have registered a case of accidental death and if any negligence is found, we will take the necessary legal action.” A team of forensic experts was called in.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/three-asphyxiate-in-ghatlodia-bakery/articleshow/86212088.cms||---

The party will put its weight behind him in the elections.” AAP also announced its election campaign committee, with Deepak Bali as the president and Basant Kumar as vice-president. The party, which announced its CM face earlier this year, is trying to emerge as a viable third option to the Congress and BJP in the state, using quality education and subsidized electricity as its poll planks.

---||Mumbai||BMC spent Rs 14k on fixing each pothole, yet craters back: BJP||MUMBAI: Even as the BMC has claimed to have filled up more than 33,000 potholes, the BJP has alleged the civic body has spent more than Rs 14,000 per crater on repairs. The BJP further alleged the BMC used shoddy material to fill up these potholes, which has seen most of the material get washed away and the craters resurface. TimesViewThat an aspiring global city like Mumbai has been unable to solve its potholes problem over the years reflects gravely on its municipal administration. Every year, the BMC spends hundreds of crores on road maintenance and repairs, but the potholes reappear with a vengeance. In civic corridors, it is well known that there is a nexus between some civic officials and road contractors. An independent committee of experts is needed to fix responsibility and check the road quality.“The BMC issued tenders worth Rs 48 crore to fill up potholes. They gave out tenders for Rs 2 crore per ward for the 24 wards. In all, till September 11, they have filled 33,000 potholes. This means the total cost for fixing each pothole is Rs 14,545. Despite this exorbitant amount, the city is full of potholes,” said BJP corporator Vinod Mishra. Last week, the BMC had said in the past five months, till September 11, it had filled 33,156 potholes. Mishra said there must be an audit of the Rs 48 crore spent on filling potholes. “Despite these bogus claims, all crucial roads in the city have potholes. The BMC data is a farce. There are at least 100 potholes on every arterial road, and let’s not even talk about the smaller roads in residential areas. Public money is going down potholes along with harassed commuters,” Mishra said. Several roads in the city continue to be full of potholes, leading to major traffic snarls. Commuters, residents groups and corporators have pointed out that several important junctions are full of potholes, slowing down traffic. While scores of motorists have complained of potholes along the busy Jogeshwari-Vikhroli Link Road, some said the ROB near Nahur station connecting Mulund-Goregaon Link Road to the Eastern Express Highway was in a bad shape too. At Malad West, potholes on the crossing of S V Road and Ramchandra Lane have been filled up in such a manner that the stretch has become uneven and risky for users. The traffic department deploys additional personnel on stretches where frequent snarls are reported. Officials said from now on, all roads wider than six metres will be concretised to ensure there are fewer potholes. “We will reconstruct all roads wider than six metres in a phased manner with cement concrete instead of asphalt. This will ensure even minor roads are pothole-free,” said a BMC official. “The BMC has already exhausted the Rs 48 crore and now wants to spend more money to fill up the remaining potholes. The BMC fills up the potholes and the next day they resurface. Filling potholes has become a money-making exercise for the BMC,” Mishra said. When contacted, additional municipal commissioner (projects) P Velrasu refused to comment on the cost of filling potholes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bmc-spent-rs-14k-on-fixing-each-pothole-yet-craters-back-in-mumbai-bjp/articleshow/86216058.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

---||Delhi||Delhi: Kalkaji set to trump Kathputli in rehabilitation||NEW DELHI: In a major milestone for Delhi Development Authority’s in situ slum rehabilitation initiative, permission for allotment of EWS houses constructed at A-14, Kalkaji Extension to eligible slum dwellers of nearby Bhoomiheen Camp was approved in the meeting chaired by LG Anil Baijal on Tuesday. While the Kathputli Colony project is older, the Kalkaji work was taken up by DDA in 2013. Unlike Kathputli Colony, which is being constructed under public-private-partnership, the Kalkaji Extension project was built by DDA itself. DDA has created 14-storey towers, which have 3,024 flats to house dwellers of Navjeevan Camp and Jawaharlal Nehru Camp, apart from Bhoomiheen Camp. While work was on for about eight years, the number of slum dwellers went up and DDA carried out a fresh survey. On Tuesday, approval was given to relocate residents of Bhumiheen Camp, which has about 2,700 households. There are 8,461 jhuggies in the area. A scheme was prepared in 2011 for in situ rehabilitation of three slum clusters in a phased manner. In the first phase, three hectares of land earmarked for a community centre was used for construction of 3,000 EWS houses. An equivalent land area was swapped at the cross section of Guru Ravi Dass Road and Govindpuri Road and a scheme was prepared for construction of EWS houses, of which 93% work is done and the project is likely to be completed next month. The land vacated by shifting the slum cluster, measuring 20,460 sqm, and land encroached by the remaining two JJ clusters, would be taken up for in situ rehabilitation on PPP mode. Eligible households would be allotted EWS flats on payment of Rs 1.1 lakh plus Rs 30,000 as maintenance charges for five years. On Tuesday, DDA also approved relocation of three slum clusters at GP Block in Pitampura, Kohat Enclave and Golden Park in Rampura, with about 2,068 households, to the EWS flats at Bhalswa proposed to be acquired from DUSIB. “In case of any shortfall or non-provisioning of the DUSIB flats, the slum dwellers will be relocated to vacant DDA EWS flats in pockets 1A, 1B and 1C, Narela. The Union ministry of housing and urban affairs will be asked to grant permission to transfer the Bhalswa flats to DDA,” the DDA spokesperson added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/kalkaji-set-to-trump-kathputli-in-rehab/articleshow/86212072.cms||---

The concept of the sub-centre was till now limited to rural areas only. Moreover, a plan is afoot to shift 14 sub-centres from rented accommodation to new government buildings. These centres, like mohalla clinics in Delhi, aim to provide primary health services to residents near their homes. The government is planning to appoint specialists and provide an array of health services to people through these centres. However, the condition of the existing sub-centres is not quite good. Of the 76 health sub-centres initially planned in Ghaziabad, 34 are lying defunct for months in the absence of community health officers (CHOs). The government had planned to upgrade the sub-centres that focused on maternal and child healthcare to health and wellness centres in Ghaziabad. The target was to increase the number of such facilities to 76 by 2020-21 fiscal. But only 42 are functional now. These sub-centres are the first healthcare points in villages and family planning drives, counselling sessions, routine immunisation programmes and ante-natal check-ups are planned at these facilities. Some centres also conduct procedures like insertion of copper IUDs as part of the family planning drive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/now-health-sub-centres-in-gzb-urban-areas-too/articleshow/86214569.cms||Aditya Dev

---||Delhi||Delhi Development Authority makes land pooling flexible and attractive||NEW DELHI: Delhi Development Authority on Tuesday gave its final approval to additional development control (ADC) norms for areas notified under its ambitious land pooling policy, in order to make it more attractive for landowners & private developers. The proposed ADC norms, which would see implementation of new features like vertical mixing and transferable development rights for the first time in Delhi, were approved at the Authority’s meeting chaired by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal. The policy, which was notified in 2018 and aims to overcome the cumbersome process of land acquisition by making landowners equal partners in the development process, has seen 6930.4 hectares of land submitted for pooling till December 20, 2020, through a web portal launched in February 2019. While DDA is to play the role of a facilitator, it is working towards initiating planning and development in some likely-to-be eligible sectors. Officials admitted, on the condition of anonymity, that though overall enough land has been pooled to create a sub-city, the land parcels are scattered and need readjustment as the response from landowners has been far short of what was expected. “That is why, these ADC norms have been brought to allow more flexibility to developers and make the policy more attractive. Now mixed use in the land pooling areas has also been approved, including high-intensity mixed-use development along major transportation corridors,” said an official. Vertical mixing, a first for the capital, would allow multiple uses in a single structure with maximum FAR of 400 and transferable development rights, which is a new concept for the capital. It would be possible to build more commercial spaces in the pooled area or more residential ones, depending on the market demand. “For instance, flexibility to convert commercial use to residential has been permitted as long as the norms are not violated. The development should not be monotonous, and developers can take up land pooling projects based on market demand,” said the official. The total area that can be built at the sector level can be varied or loaded across different plots in a sector but without exceeding the maximum FAR limit of the sector, so that an overall balance is maintained. The new norms also allow plotted development in areas notified for land pooling in a cluster of a minimum size of 5,000 sq m on a net residential plot. Priority has been given to walkability, enhanced open spaces, public plazas and active frontage in the sectors. The proposed ADC norms will now be forwarded to the union ministry of housing and urban affairs for its consideration and final notification. The policy is at present applicable in the urban extension areas of Delhi, comprising 95 villages. The entire area is divided into 109 sectors, with an average area of 250 to 350 hectares in each sector, which are expected to accommodate a population of 80,000 to 1 lakh. Other important decisions taken by the Authority include constitution of a board for reviewing the objections and suggestions received on the draft Master Plan for Delhi-2041. DDA is working towards getting the final approval for MPD-2041 by December. DDA also approved modification of the nomenclature for a plot earmarked for a sports complex in Dwarka’s Sector-19 to name it International Sports Complex. The area is expected to become an entertainment and tourist destination with real estate development like hotels, retail, convention centre, residential, etc. It was decided at the meeting that facilities would be available to public not only on the basis of membership but through pay-and-play services too. DDA also changed the land use from residential to transportation for a multi-level car parking facility at Idgah Road, which would help north corporation and DMRC to construct the facility, which is coming up as an integrated project with the proposed Nabi Karim interchange Metro station of Phase IV.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dda-makes-land-pooling-flexible-attractive/articleshow/86212178.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Broken roads, floating household items, damaged bridges and flattened farmlands bore testimony to the furious downpour that began on Sunday midnight and continued till Monday evening. People were seen rummaging through water and sludge in hope of recovering some of the washed away valuables in several villages even as the district administration pressed in teams to dispose of water and dirt in the urban areas of Jamnagar and Rajkot cities. The air was filled with unbearable stench of dampened garbage and dead animals in villages. According to sources, at least 450 villages of Kalavad, Dhrol, Jodiya, Jamjodhpur and Jamnagar rural have suffered severe destruction that emerged after waters receded Dharmendra Zala, a resident of Aliyabada village said, “There is a huge loss of livestock in the villages.

Aneesh (45) went missing on Friday and his body was found in a forested area of Masuri the next day. According to police, on Saturday, about five hours after Aneesh’s body was found, his uncle Jaan Mohammad hanged himself in his home in Hapur, 2km away from Masuri. Aneesh’s wife and Jaan allegedly hatched a plan to kill him so that they could sell his land and buy a house for themselves with that money. The police have recovered CCTV footage in which Aneesh can be seen travelling towards Hapur in an auto-rickshaw on Friday morning. During investigation, the police found that Aneesh had got dropped near Jaan’s house that day. Shailendra Singh, SHO, Masuri, said Aneesh’s wife told them that she was in a relationship with Jaan for about five years and he used to help them with money regularly as Aneesh’s income was not enough to run the family. “About a week ago, Aneesh’s wife and Jaan planned the murder. The woman sent Aneesh to Hapur on Friday saying there is some work for him and he would be able to earn Rs 15,000. At Hapur, Aneesh met Jaan who took him to a deserted area and killed him,” he said, adding that the woman told the family that Aneesh was out to get some medicines and would return soon. “The next day, Jaan was seen throwing some clothes into the canal. When the police questioned him, he could not answer properly. Later, he went to his hou-se and committed suicide,” the station house officer (SHO) said. According to the police, Jaan and Aneesh’s wife had planned to sell a nine bigha plot after killing him. They wanted to buy a house in Hapur with that money and stay together. “The plot was in Aneesh and his wife’s name. The woman wanted to sell it but Aneesh was not ready to do so. She and Jaan hatched a plan to kill Aneesh so that they could sell the land. They also fixed a deal with someone who was ready to buy it,” a police officer said. Initially, an FIR had been registered against Aneesh’s brother-in-law Rahat, his brother Farhat and another person under Section 302 (punishment for murder) of the Indian Penal Code. Now, Aneesh’s wife and Jaan’s names would be included in it and they would be booked for murder, an officer said. Rahat, Farhat and the other man’s names would be removed from the complaint, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/mans-body-found-in-masuri-wife-held-for-murder/articleshow/86214608.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Gorky Sadan shooting a case of road rage: Cops||Kolkata: The shooting at Gorky Sadan on Sunday night was a case of road rage, revealed a preliminary investigation into the incident. Cops have arrested one person in this connection. The youth, who had fired at Howrah businessman Pankaj Singh (38), and several other bikers, however, are still at large. Joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma said that raids were on in Kolkata and adjoining districts of South 24 Parganas and Howrah to nab them. Ruling out any business rivalry or any other motive for the daring shooting at the Woodburn Park-AJC Bose Road intersection opposite Gorky Sadan, cops said the bikers, who had chased, overtaken and intercepted the car — in which Singh and his friends were travelling — were from Panditya Road and were part of the Ganesh immersion procession that was making its way to Babughat. Police sources said the road rage trigger could have been attempts by the car to overtake the immersion procession comprising two trucks and half a dozen bikes somewhere near Beckbagan crossing. “The overtaking and perhaps honking by the car, in which Singh and his friends were travelling, appears to have infuriated the bikers. They appear to have chased the car as soon as it overtook them,” said an officer. Even as the bikes drew alongside the car at Minto Park crossing, there was a heated exchange of words between the two sides. At the next intersection, the bikes overtook the car and forced it to stop. With the bikers shouting profanities and making gestures, Singh alighted from the car to challenge them. The heated argument soon turned into a scuffle and assault. That is when one of the bikers pulled out a gun and fired at Singh from behind.  The Anti Rowdy Squad of detective department has taken over the case from Shakespeare Sarani police station. Cops have so far identified around eight to nine bikers who were involved in the incident. One of them — Ronit Gupta alias Bongi (21), a resident of Sevak Baidya Street near Dover Terrace, who works with an app-based food delivery company — has been arrested. He has claimed one of his friends shot at Singh after the latter held him by the collar. The Anti Rowdy Squad of detective department and the Shakespeare Sarani police have used CCTV footage and the information from local sources to identify the accused involved in the shooting late on Sunday night. While both the procession and Singh and his friends were violating night curbs (the shooting happened around 11.20pm), cops were worried over the fact that a gun was being carried by a participant of the immersion procession. “We have registered a case of attempt to murder, hurt and assault along with section 25 and 27 of the Arms Act,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/gorky-sadan-shooting-a-case-of-road-rage-cops/articleshow/86212249.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Delhi||Delhi: Norms for alterations, additions to DDA flats streamlined||NEW DELHI: In a decision that is likely to benefit lakhs of people living in DDA flats, the policy and procedures for regularisation of additions and alterations have been amended and streamlined. DDA has also clarified that all residents have right to access terraces and common staircases and these are not for the exclusive use of any individual owner or group of owners. “While the policy& procedures already exist, amendments and clarity were needed on some issues,” said an official. DDA clarified that common areas, including terrace and common staircase extended to the terrace of an apartment block, shall remain common to all residents or owners of the block and cannot be used by any particular resident or owner or group of residents or owners exclusively. TimesViewThis is a much-delayed but welcome step by the DDA. Hopefully, it will help clear misunderstandings, end forcible occupations of common usage space, and consequently improve relations among neighbours.“Water tanks and many common services are located on terraces, but in some places people on the top floors restrict access by making them exclusively their own. Also, in many old DDA flats, one needs to enter the topmost flat to access the stairs leading to the terrace. This leads to altercations sometimes as for other residents, accessing the terrace means taking permission from top floor residents,” said the official. The official added, “Now, it will be ensured that everyone has equal access to these services and if staircases have to be accessed through someone’s flat, another access will be allowed to be created. These are very small things, but matter a lot for harmonious and co-existential living. We are streamlining the processes and adding new provisions.” “We have also allowed covered verandahs and balconies and these can be legalised by payment of charges. For other alterations and additions, flat owners can submit the plan and get them authorised after paying charges. The amended policy touches very basic but important things, like installation of split airconditioner units. We have tried to make it public-friendly,” the official said. The policy and procedures were formulated in 2007, but regular complaints from allottees were being received by DDA and the municipal corporations regarding interpretation of provisions, leading to disputes and court cases, a DDA spokesperson said. Under the policy, installation of solar panels for domestic use would be allowed. Requests for allowing installation of charging points for electric vehicles would be examined separately.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/norms-for-alterations-additions-to-flats-streamlined/articleshow/86212212.cms||---

As the local police gathered evidence, registered an FIR and launched a hunt for Rahul for his wife’s murder, it got information about his death in an accident on NH-24. According to police, Rahul and Rani, 24, were not on good terms since their wedding. “He (Rahul) used to regularly quarrel with his wife over dowry and other matters,” a source said. A resident of Sambhal district’s Khetpur village, Rani had come to Moradabad’s Pakhbara area after the wedding three years ago. But, after yet another round of quarrel, she had been living at her parents’ home in Sambhal. About ten days ago, Rahul went to her in-laws home and brought his wife back to Moradabad, with a promise of good behaviour. But the clashes resumed. And on Sunday, when Rani was fast asleep, Rahul allegedly put a live electric wire on her neck, leaving her grievously injured. Station house officer (SHO) of Pakhbara police station, Yogendra Singh Yadav, told TOI, “The accused electrocuted his wife to death. The woman was found unconscious with burn marks around her neck on Monday morning. An FIR was registered under IPC section 304(B) (dowry death) and under the Dowry Prohibition Act. The woman’s body was sent for a postmortem examination.” As the police were trying to trace the accused, they got information about his death. SHO Yadav said, “The accused, Rahul, who was absconding, was killed in a road accident on Tuesday in Mainather area of Moradabad. He was run over by a speeding vehicle on NH-24.” The couple are survived by a daughter, who is just 17-month-old.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/on-the-run-after-electrocuting-wife-to-death-up-man-26-run-over-on-nh-24/articleshow/86210059.cms||Maria Khan
---||Pune||Temghar full, water level to be lowered for pending repairs, says Maharashtra irrigation department||PUNE: The state irrigation department on Tuesday said water from Temghar reservoir — filled to 100% for the first time this rainy season — would be used on priority so that work to stop seepage from the dam’s wall could be taken up once the monsoon ends. Irrigation department officials said 95% of the seepage had been plugged and that it was safe to fill up the dam. The remainder of the work could not be completed before the monsoon due to Covid-induced curbs, an official said. Water would be released during the discharge schedule starting next month; Temghar can hold 3.7 thousand million cubic feet (TMC) of water. “We have already sent a revised proposal for additional funds — for long-term strengthening of the dam — to the state government and expect it to be approved next month,” an official said. The official said the pending 5% of the work would only be possible once the water level is brought down to its lowest — treatment is planned on the inside of the wall, upwards from the bottom. “The repair plan is ready. We can implement it once the water level is lowered in a phased manner,” the official added. A state-appointed committee of experts had given the go-ahead fill Temghar to 100% during the monsoon. Once the repair work is complete, the irrigation department would conduct frequent inspections of the dam wall. So far this monsoon, the reservoir’s catchments have received over 2,830mm of rainfall, highest among the 25 major dams in Bhima basin. Water from the reservoir was released on Monday once it touched 100%. “The ongoing release is necessary as the reservoir gets an inflow of rainwater. The released water flows into Khadakwasla reservoir,” another official said. Meanwhile, water release from Khadakwasla into the Mutha river continued on Tuesday at the rate of 9,000 cusec towards the evening, due to reduced rainfall activity in the catchments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/temghar-full-water-level-to-be-lowered-for-pending-repairs/articleshow/86212275.cms||Sarang Dastane

The boy’s father, however, managed to rescue him with the help of villagers. The same leopard is suspected to be behind the attacks. Farmer Radhe Yadav had just parked his bike outside his house when he saw a leopard dragging away his son, Sandeep, outside the house. Without wasting a moment, he jumped at the leopard and caught its hind leg. Hearing their screams for help, neighbours rushed to their aid and attacked the leopard with sticks. Surrounded by people, the leopard let go of the boy and escaped. Sandeep sustained multiple injuries. He is being treated at the community health centre ,where his condition is said to be stable but he is still under the shock. Anil Patel, divisional forest officer, told TOI, “This area is affected by floods which is why the leopard has shifted towards it. The village is also on the banks of river Ghaghra and is surrounded by flood waters. The only way to reach the village from the city is by boat. We are unable to carry a cage to the village at the moment, but we have installed two fox lights to keep wild animals away at night. Locals have been advised to be cautious and keep children indoors after sunset.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/man-saves-son-from-jaws-of-leopard/articleshow/86210096.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: App cab refusals plague flyers returning home from airport||KOLKATA: Passengers coming out of Kolkata airport are being subjected to harassment every day over the last few weeks as app cab drivers refuse to pick them up unless they tell them their destinations. The drivers are allegedly taking passengers only for the destinations of their choice and if the rider doesn’t share the destination over phone or if the driver doesn’t want to go there, he simply doesn’t turn up or doesn’t respond to the person’s call, forcing the passenger to cancel the ride. “It has become a regular menace at the airport. Currently, the app cab service is worse than the yellow cabs. The yellow cab drivers still have the habit of asking the destination and then charge Rs 30 or Rs 50 extra over the usual fare but they at least take you to home or office. The app cab drivers don’t even turn up if they don’t like the destination and they wouldn’t even bother to tell you that. I spent close to an hour and had to cancel three cabs while coming back to my Parnasree home from the airport,” said Sourav Sen, a frequent flyer. App cabs in Kolkata had gained popularity following the yellow cab drivers’ frequent refusals that had even prompted the then transport minister Madan Mitra to launch the “No Refusal” taxi movement. But with time, the disease has even crept upon app cabs. “I was heading to a hotel in Rajarhat barely 5km from the airport. But three drivers cancelled my trip upon hearing the destination before a fourth one finally accepted me,” said Namrata Sharma, a businesswoman from Guwahati. App cab drivers cited the lack of passengers on return journey and the destinations far away from cabbies’ home as the major reasons behind the cancellations. “With fuel prices clocking Rs 100 mark and the company providing us with meagre incentives, it becomes difficult for us to drive for several kilometres without a passenger to pick someone and drive him to a short distance or a place, from where there is less chance of getting another passenger. Hence, we plan our trips accordingly to cut down on losses,” said Suman Seth, an app cab driver at the airport. Both the online aggregators of cabs and commuters said that the problem of refusal has been persisting for the last three months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/app-cab-refusals-plague-flyers-returning-home-from-airport/articleshow/86212289.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Selvakumar had petitioned against renaming the airport after Thevar and also sought to rename it after Goddess Meenakshi.A division bench of justices M Duraiswamy and K Murali Shankar observed that it was the contention of the petitioner that the Centre was taking steps to rename the airport after Thevar and in such case there would be a law and order problem.The judges took note of the submissions of the standing counsel appearing for the Centre who stated that there was no proposal to rename the airport after Thevar or any other personalities. He submitted that the proposal should emanate from the state government for renaming. He further submitted that if a proposal or recommendation is received from the state, the Centre would consider the same in accordance with law.The judges observed that from the above submissions, it is clear that the petition is speculative of nature and it was filed without any basis. Hence, the judges observed that they are not inclined to entertain the petition and dismissed it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-dismisses-plea-against-renaming-of-madurai-airport/articleshow/86214644.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Disha accused was down with kidney ailment, says his widow||HYDERABAD: Ch Renuka, the 17-year-old widow of Chennakeshavulu, who was accused in the Disha rape and murder case told the Supreme Court appointed commission of inquiry on Tuesday that her husband could not have committed the crime. “How could he (Chennakeshavulu) commit such a crime when he could barely stand? He was suffering from a kidney ailment,” she told the lawyer of a cop involved in the alleged encounter. Referring to her affidavit before the commission, the advocate asked on what basis she called the encounter as fake and termed it a brutal murder. Renuka stated her husband worked on the lorry for some time and had to quit due to kidney problems. A few days after his arrest, they received a call from police informing them that her husband was unable to stand and was falling down. “We told them he was suffering from kidney problems and, on their insistence for proof, my father-in-law sent medical records,” Renuka said. The counsel, representing police, then showed CCTV grabs where Chennakeshavulu was standing with the accused. Prior to that, Renuka mentioned before the commission that at the time of her marriage, she was 13 and her husband 15 years old, adding that she wrongly mentioned her age as 19 in the affidavit due to fear as she was a minor. At 3am on November 29, 2019, truck owner Srinivas Reddy came to their house and along with others in civil dress and took him away saying they wanted him to show the house of Arif, another accused killed in the alleged encounter, Renuka said. Referring to the accident, the commission’s counsel Virupaksha Dattatreya Goud asked her why did police attend to the treatment of her father-in-law. While admitting that police had attended to the treatment, Renuka alleged that Srinivas Reddy could be responsible for the accident as the incident happened two days after her father-in-law expressed fear of something happening to him. During crossexamination by state counsel V Surender Rao, Renuka said she had two Aadhaar, but discarded one.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/disha-accused-was-down-with-painful-kidney-ailment-claims-his-widow/articleshow/86214671.cms||Mahesh Buddi

Coordinator of Neernilaigal Pathukappu Kuzhu, R Abubakkar said that the plight of the 10 channels from Sellur kanmoi in Meenambalpuram all the way to GRH in Alwarpuram are heavily polluted with sewage and it is made worse by garbage being dumped into them, something that the civic body has never been able to address. Dumper bins are placed on the sides of the channels near the bridges and when they fill up, which is very frequent, the garbage overflows into the channels. K Thiru of Sellur said that even sanitary workers burn the garbage near the bridges when their vehicles are overloaded. Bakker added that there are not enough sanitary workers. “The sanitary workers cannot deal with the huge tonnes of garbage being generated in some of the streets near the Vaigai river. They just dump the excess waste into the channels and burn them. This is a common sight on the Meenambalpuram - Poonthamalli bridge.” “The bridge in Jeeva street has tonnes of garbage dumped on it and it looks as though it never cleaned,” said S Saraswthy of Meenambalpuram, who says that these dumps have given their area the nickname ‘dirty area’. “Adding to the woes, heavy vehicles bring building debris and dump it near the Kamarajar second street. If heavy vehicle movement is prevented on this road the debris cannot be dumped,” he said.

A PMC official on Tuesday said MahaMetro has been told not to dig up roads without permission. “Our teams are conducting inspections. Repair and filling of potholes has already begun at some spots,” the official said. Hemant Sonawane, general manager (public relations) at MahaMetro, said steps are being taken along with the PMC out repair roads at all stretches. Separate teams will now work on stretches along Paud Road, Karve Road, Raj Bahadur Mill Road and others, according to Maha-Metro.“The agencies working on the field have been told to carry out repairs on priority. We are in communication with the municipal corporation’s road department and are extending necessary assistance to restore roads,” said Sonawane. At junctions or stretches with huge traffic flow, MahaMetro is installing prefabricated structures to avoid road closures, he said. Road users and elected representatives have sought repairs at regular intervals. A meeting of MahaMetro and municipal corporation officials was also convened recently. Separate teams will now work on stretches along Paud Road, Karve Road, Raj Bahadur Mill Road and others, according to MahaMetro. Murad Shaikh, an autorickshaw driver who operates in the Pune Station area, said stretches of the road from Sangam Bridge to Bund Garden are in need of repair. “The road is bound to deteriorate because of the Metro work. Motorists are navigating around potholes, wet roads, dust, diversions and uneven patches,” said Shaikh. Motorists who use Paud Road and Karve Road raised similar issues. Dipali Shetti, a private bank employee, said there are potholes and rough patches along the stretches where the Metro work is going on. “Roads should be cleaned regularly. Also, lighting needs must be improved for the safety of road users at night,” said Shetti. According to activist Sandeep Khardekar, regular meetings and visits are held with MahaMetro and PMC officials to minimise commuters’ problems. “We have also told the administration to ensure that other facilities such as footpaths, walkways and crossings along the roads remain intact during the Metro work,” said Khardekar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mahametro-pmc-to-jointly-repair-roads-fill-potholes/articleshow/86212350.cms||Sarang Dastane

---||Ahmedabad||Chip shortage boosts used car demand||Ahmedabad: Dinesh Joshi, a city-based developer, was looking for a new car but ended up buying a pre-owned sedan car. “I travel between Changodar and Ahmedabad every day and wanted a CNG car. However, company-fitted CNG models for high-end cars come costly. Therefore, I opted for a second-hand car and got the CNG kit retro-fitted. It gives me the comfort of driving the car I like and it takes care of fuel cost too,” Joshi said. Increased waiting time for delivery and rising cost of new cars have led customers towards the after-market, pushing up the sale of used cars. Estimates by Ahmedabad-based dealers suggest that used car sales have grown by a significant 25% against pre-pandemic levels, going by sales figures of July and August. “Key factors propelling pre-owned car demand include increased waiting time for new cars, which has increased up to five months for new cars, due to the ongoing semi-conductor shortage faced by auto-makers globally. People are not getting their preferred model and the delay continues. Therefore, many are opting for used cars,” said Pranav Shah, chairman, Gujarat region, Federation of Automobile Dealers’ Association (FADA). “New cars are getting costlier due to BS-VI transition and also a change in tax structure on automobiles due to which customers are getting diverted towards the second-hand car market,” he said. The demand for pre-owned luxury cars has also gone up for similar reasons. “I always wanted to buy a BMW 3 Series and preferred a car which is under warranty. When I checked used cars, I got one which was cheaper by Rs 15 lakh. The car was barely used for a year and is in brilliant condition. Instead of shelling out more money on a luxury car which has become costlier, I opted for a pre-owned variant,” said Aadhar Kumar, owner of a pathology and diagnostics firm. Used car dealers attribute the surge in demand to increased preference for a personal vehicle post-pandemic. Suresh Ramnani, director of an Ahmedabad-based used car dealership, said, “The overall demand is good because people want a personal vehicle for themselves and are discouraging use of public transport. We are sealing deals on at least 80 cars every month and people come with various budgets. Cars that are up to 3-4 years old are in maximum demand.” Rising cost of ownership of cars due to surge in fuel prices is also one of the crucial factors impacting sale of cars, according to dealers. “As petrol and diesel prices have skyrocketed, preference for CNG cars has gone up. While the waiting period for company-fitted CNG cars is as high as five months, new BS-VI enabled vehicles cannot be retro-fitted with CNG kits later as per RTO norms. As a consequence, customers are increasingly opting for used cars and getting their vehicles retro-fitted with CNG kits,” said Jigar Vyas, CEO of a city-based dealership.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/chip-shortage-boosts-used-car-demand/articleshow/86212432.cms||Niyati Parikh
---||Meerut||Employee, aide held for murder of ex-minister in UP||Meerut: Two men accused of killing a senior BJP leader in Uttar Pradesh’s Baghpat district were arrested on Tuesday. Atmaram Tomar (75), a party veteran who was given ministerial-rank post in Kalyan Singh government, was found murdered at his home on Thursday night. Marks of last minute struggle were found all over his body. The family members of Tomar had filed a case against the two men, including a relative who worked at a cooking gas agency owned by the BJP leader. On the basis of a complaint filed by Tomar’s son and after scanning the CCTV footage of the house, local police had booked the main accused Praveen Kumar and his accomplice Balram Singh on Friday. “Both of them have been arrested now,” a police officer said. During the course of its probe, police had on Sunday arrested two men, Manmohan Singh and Subhash Kumar, for allegedly giving shelter to the two main accused. The SUV stolen from Tomar’s home was also recovered from their possession. On Tuesday, police recovered the keys of the SUV from main accused Praveen. During questioning, Praveen alleged that Tomar used to “treat him like a servant” and wouldn’t even give him the salary on time. Superintendent of police (SP) of Baghpat, Neeraj Jadaun, said, “Both the murder accused, Praveen and Balram, have been arrested. They have confessed to their crime as well. We have also recovered SUV keys and the mobile phone of the deceased.” Tomar, who stayed alone at his home, was found dead on Thursday night. Tomar’s elder son, Pratap, a radiologist, had said, “Praveen used to work at my father's gas agency. He was sacked due to financial irregularities recently. However, my father called him back at the family's request. But he was still angry. Praveen and his accomplice Balram killed my father.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/employee-aide-held-for-murder-of-ex-minister-in-up/articleshow/86210134.cms||Sandeep Rai

---||India||Richest 10% in India own over 50% of assets: NSS||The richest 10% of Indians own over half of the country's physical and financial assets while the bottom 50% own less than 10%, a recently released government report shows. The All India Debt & Investment Survey, 2019, conducted by the National Sample Survey shows the richest 10% owns 55.7% of the total assets in urban areas and 50.8% in rural areas. Assets were calculated by putting a monetary value on everything owned by households, including physical assets like land, buildings, livestock and vehicles as well as financial ones like shares in companies, deposits in bank, and post offices, etc. The survey, conducted from January to December 2019, estimated that the total physical and financial assets owned by people living in the rural areas was to the tune of Rs 274.6 lakh crore of which Rs 139.6 lakh crore was owned by the richest 10%. In rural areas, the top 10% owned assets worth Rs 132.5 lakh crore out a total of Rs 238.1 lakh crore. The bottom 50% owned 10.2% of assets in rural areas and an even smaller 6.2% in urban areas. The skew is more marked in some states. Within rural areas, where close to two-thirds of India lives, the skew was the highest in Delhi, with the top 10% owning 80.8% of assets and the bottom 50% just 2.1%. This could be because of the high valuation of whatever is left of rural land in the capital's peripheries. Among large states, after Delhi, asset inequality in rural areas was starkest in Punjab where the richest 10% own over 65% of assets and the bottom 50% just over 5%. Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh and Haryana also had pronounced skews in asset ownership in the villages. Among large states (and UTs), the rural skew was the least in Jammu and Kashmir with the top 10% owning 32% and the bottom half 18%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/richest-10-in-india-own-over-50-of-assets-nss/articleshow/86217266.cms||Atul Thakur
---||Hyderabad||Saidabad rape case: Zero technical intelligence paralyses probe, police left searching in the dark||HYDERABAD: The reliance on technical intelligence to crack cases stood exposed as investigators have not been able to make any headway in capturing the accused even five days after the rape and murder of the 6-year-old girl in Saidabad. The probe has been paralysed as the accused has not used a mobile and cops haven’t found any great CCTV footage. This is the second such case in recent times where investigation was derailed due to lack of technical input. Earlier, cops took more than a month to capture a few undertrial prisoners who had escaped from Gandhi Hospital’s Covid-19 ward. Generally, during press conferences, senior Telangana cops claim that they cracked the case quickly using technical evidence such as CCTV footage, tower location of mobiles used by the accused and call detail record (CDR). But retired IPS officers cautioned that though technology does help in producing results quickly, it has also increased expectations of the people. “There should always be a mix of technology and traditional policing. Police should avoid making the claim that they cracked a case in the shortest time while declaring arrest. In the absence of leads from technology, it is an extremely time-consuming task. In the present generation policing, system of having informants should be strengthened,” former additional director general of police VK Singh told TOI. In the 6-year-old’s rape and murder case, police quizzed all the relatives and friends with a hope that he might get in touch with one of them while being on the run. But till now he had not called or contacted any of the expected persons. As the accused has worked in the past in Suryapet, Mahbubanagar, Yadadri-Bhongir, Warangal, Hanumakonda, cops are also exploring the possibility that he might have gone to one of these districts.

Bhaskar Pandey was arrested on Monday from Haldwani in a joint operation of Special Task Force (STF) and Almora Police. Director general of police (DGP) of Uttarakhand, Ashok Kumar, said, “During questioning, Pandey has confessed that he was trying to rebuild the Maoist cadre and was in search of recruiting more persons from the hills. He also confessed to have undergone training under the extremist CPI (Maoist) outfit, which is banned under the UAPA.” DGP Kumar said that Pandey was the “last important Maoist” who was hiding from police. “He was also involved in the last Maoist activity in the state that took place before 2017 assembly polls where the jeep of tehsildar was burnt in Dhari area of Nainital,” the police officer said. Before 2017, maoism was active in Kumaon, in areas like Almora, Nainital and Dhari. Petty crimes, like burning vehicles, were reported before the assembly elections then. In 2004, in two places at Nainital and US Nagar, arms training camps run by naxal outfit NCCI had been busted. Most maoists caught in Uttarakhand could be traced back to these camps. Since 2003, Uttarakhand Police have registered 33 cases in Maoist-related activities and arrested 24 people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/last-important-maoist-in-uttarakhand-was-on-mission-to-revive-cadres-before-polls-claims-dgp/articleshow/86210176.cms||Gaurav Talwar

The group said the step was leading to wastage of public funds. The PMC was spending around Rs1.25 crore on these tanks. “The way these tanks have been taken on rent is suspicious. The expense is unnecessary. The civic officials, who are responsible, should be taken to task,” said Vivek Velankar of the group. The civic administration justified its initiative saying that the move aimed at avoiding crowding at immersion sites. “The civic administration has taken 60 tanks on rent. The PMC plans to spend Rs11.5 lakh per day on these tanks. The facility has been taken on rent for 11 days. Even if the festival is of ten days the rent is given for 11 days?” Velankar said. The group on Tuesday wrote a letter to the PMC an inquiry. It stated last year only 30 tanks were used. “What was the need of taking 60 tanks this year?” the letter stated. The group also demanded an inquiry into the expense of around Rs 19,121 per mobile van per day. “The civic administration has come up with this initiative to avoid large gatherings at the makeshift tanks. It aims at promoting social distancing,” said Ajit Deshmukh, head of PMC’s solid waste management department. He said the due tender process was carried out before giving the contract. Six bidders had applied and competitive rates were finalized. As per the PMC, the tender amount included driver, helper, fuel, maintenance, accident insurance, travel expenses, water expense and banners.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/citizens-group-questions-immersion-tanks-expenditure/articleshow/86212380.cms||---

As physical education has been prohibited at schools due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the facility was set up to help students relieve stress by playing traditional board games such as Snakes and Ladders, Chess, Pallanguli etc.,“The students have been out of school for more than one and a half years and are also spending a lot of time on mobile phones. We wanted to do something for the students as a fun activity to enjoy and also learn. We enjoyed playing these traditional games when we were younger, so we came up with the idea. We never expected it to become such a hit among students,” said S Sasithra, headmistress of the school. The headmistress said the playground allows students to be out in the open air and feel connected to nature.“The idea was to make everything as natural as possible. That is why instead of buying board games, we painted everything. This helps students feel more connected socially to the outside world unlike in the case of games on mobile phones. Students can play whenever they get a recess,” said Sasithra.Apart from helping students relax, the traditional board games also help students improve concentration, brain activity and fine motor skills. “Students also learn life lessons from these traditional games and it creates a healthy competition among them. They also learn why ancestors gave importance behind playing such games,” the headmistress added.The school has a strength of around 2,500 students, while just more than 1,000 students are from Class IX to XII.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/govt-school-sets-up-traditional-games-facility-for-students/articleshow/86214736.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The association has also sought weekly-off of one day for those on Covid-19 duty considering the physical and mental health of doctors and other healthcare staff.Addressing media at Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH), Dr K Senthil, state president of TNGDA, said that the GO was sanctioned to resolve various issues over pay hike and promotion. “However, following resentment of doctors working in primary health centres (PHC) and others who didn’t gain expediency over the sanctioned GO, the TNGDA insisted on certain amendments,” he added.After the state minister for health and family welfare, Ma Subramaniam, organised a meeting with other doctors associations to consider and discuss difference of opinion over the GO, he said that decision will be taken after consulting the same with chief minister M K Stalin. “Following this, without any available written orders, officials have communicated to stop the implementation of the GO for the past two months,” said Dr Senthil.The TNGDA has also demanded for the Covid-19 incentive of Rs 20,000 and Rs 30,000 to be provided as promised by the government at the earliest and others, who are deserving of it to also be considered for it. “Covid-19 vaccination must be completed at the earliest for all above 18 years of age especially with the possibility of a third wave,” added Dr Senthil. The state executive committee meeting of TNGDA has been scheduled in Madurai on October 3 and if the demands are not met, further course of action is set to be taken then, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/tngda-demands-implementation-of-go-incentives/articleshow/86214730.cms||---

Dismissing the PIL filed by one Arun Pathak of Mirzapur, a division bench comprising Acting Chief Justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari and Justice AK Ojha said, “The temples in the premises of Maa Vindhyavasini Devi Temple are private temples, thereby public interest litigation would not be maintainable.” In the PIL, the petitioner had sought from the court a direction to the state government and concerned authorities not to damage/demolish certain temples within the campus of Maa Vindhyavasini Devi Temple. However, the state government’s counsel informed the court that in the year 2006 also, a PIL was filed, seeking similar directions restraining demolition of small temples inside the temple campus. This PIL was dismissed on March 30, 2007, while observing that the temples in the premises of Maa Vindhyavasini Devi Temple were private temples and thereby PIL would not be maintainable. The state counsel apprised the court about the previous order and the temple project and pleaded that the PIL was not maintainable. The court said that the PIL filed earlier also was dismissed by the court on March 30, 2007, saying that the PIL against the private temple is not maintainable. On this basis, the court dismissed the petition as not admissible.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/hc-dismisses-pil-against-razing-of-small-temples-in-vindhyachal/articleshow/86212425.cms||Rajesh Kumar Pandey

---||Pune||Pune: Gauri puja & visarjan celebrated with fervour||PUNE: Women brought Gauri, the deity known as the mother of Lord Ganesh, home with great fervor on Sunday for a three-day celebration. The Gauri and Ganapati visarjan was held on Tuesday. Women were seen carrying the deity ‘mukuts’to local lakes and water bodies for visarjan, but the numbers were far less than previous years. “Many households have brass or metal mukuts (heads) of the idol so the visarjan is a symbolic gesture to bid the deity goodbye until next year. After immersing it in water, we take it out and store it to use the next year. Some people purchase the same made of PoP or clay every year, so they perform a proper visarjan,” said Vaidehi Suryawanshi, resident of Bibvewadi. “Gauri puja is a celebration of womanhood in all it’s variations. This year, my husband and children also helped prepare all of Gauri’s favourite dishes such as bhakri, bhaji, sweet dishes and faral and modaks,” said Priyanka Kulkarni from Sadashiv Peth. “It is believed Gauri comes to her maternal home and devotees pamper her while she is there. Last year, there was no fanfare, but this year all our women relatives come over for the haldi-kumkum which on Monday,” said Rutuja Patil, resident from Gangadham. Rashmi Bhedekar, from Kothrud, said, “As the only daughter of the family, I am also pampered a lot along with Gauri.We dressed up our idol in my mother’s jewellery and bought new sarees for her. I also invited my colleagues for lunch and darshan.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/gauri-puja-visarjan-celebrated-with-fervour/articleshow/86212359.cms||Anjali Jhangiani
---||Mumbai||Court points to lapses in Rs 73-lakh robbery investigation, pulls up cop||MUMBAI: Pointing to the lapses in the investigation into a Rs 73-lakh robbery case, a sessions court has said that the ACP Zone II should be apprised of the lapses and requested to take necessary action. “Considering the lapses in the investigation, it is desirable that the Assistant Commissioner of Police, Zone II, be apprised of the same with a request to give necessary instructions and directions to the investigating officers,” the court said. The court gave the directions in an order granting bail to one of the accused, Govaram Devasi. The court said that except the alleged disclosure by the co-accused, there is absolutely no evidence against Devasi. The court said that the investigating officer could have collected the call detail record of all the accused to ascertain whether they were in contact at all the relevant times. “However, he apparently has not paid any heed to such an important aspect of the investigation. Therefore, except the statement of the co-accused, there remains no other material to show that the present accused was also involved in commission of the said offence,” the court said. Devasi and three others were arrested in April for allegedly assaulting a 49-year-old South Mumbai homemaker in her flat and decamping with Rs 72 lakh in cash. The accused were arrested from Rajasthan. The woman, the wife of a garment trader, knew the accused as he frequented their house. During investigation, Rs 64 lakh was recovered at the instance of the “associates” of the accused. The court pointed out that though Devasi was alleged to be the main conspirator, there was hardly any evidence to substantiate this. The court then called the investigating officer to show the evidence available against him. The officer appeared and produced copies of the disclosure statement of the “associates” of the accused who had allegedly disclosed his involvement in the robbery. “Such being the material against him and as the chargesheet has already been filed, further detention of the accused does not seem necessary,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-court-points-to-lapses-in-rs-73-lakh-robbery-investigation-pulls-up-cop/articleshow/86212705.cms||Rebecca Samervel

The girl, who is the daughter of Muskan Ali Mirza, 41, a beggar from Prem Nagar Colony in Amberpet, was kidnapped by the accused, Asia Bee, a garments seller from Shadnagar. At 11 am on Monday, when Muskan was seeking alms near Chanchalguda prison along with her daughter, Alfiya, Asia Bee approached her using a pseudo name, Fatima. The kidnapper told Muskan that a person known to her was willing to donate money at Hafeez Baba Nagar and took Muskan along with the girl to Hafeez Baba Nagar in an auto. Near Habeeb function hall, the kidnapper pointed to a house and asked Muskan to go inside alone to get the money from the landlord. When Muskan started walking towards the house, the kidnapper stopped an auto and left the place along with the girl. Based on the complaint of Muskan, Kanchanbagh police registered a kidnapping case and six teams launched a manhunt to nab the accused. Police verified the CCTV footage and realised that the kidnapper went to Shamshabad in an auto and from there reached Farooqnagar by travelling in a bus and an auto. “We rescued the girl from Asia Bee’s house. Asia Bee wanted to give the girl to a relative who has three sons and wanted a daughter,” Kanchanbagh DI B Kotaiah said. Asia Bee was previously involved in a case related to illegal sale of PDS rice.

---||Dehradun||SC quashes U’khand HC verdict not recognising case transferred by Allahabad HC||Nainital: The Uttarakhand high court dismissing a 25-year-old case transferred to it by the Allahabad high court is “not tenable at law,” the Supreme Court said on Monday, while quashing the Uttarakhand high court order. “Considering the fact that the dispute is very old, we request the High Court to finally decide and dispose of the (case) at the earliest and preferably within a period of six months from the date of receipt of the present order,” the order by Justices MR Shah and Aniruddha Bose said, asking the Uttarakhand high court to maintain “judicial discipline”. The case goes back to 1996. The services of an Uttar Pradesh Jal Vidyut Nigam Limited (UPJVNL) employee, Balbeer Singh, had been terminated. The Dehradun labour court held that his dismissal was illegal and ordered that Singh be reinstated. The UPJVNL approached the high court which, at that point, had jurisdiction over what is now Uttarakhand. In 2000, when UP was bifurcated, the Uttar Pradesh Reorganisation Act said all cases based in Uttarakhand should be moved out of the Allahabad high court. Singh’s case was never transferred. It came up for hearing in 2014 and the Allahabad high court allowed UPJVNL to withdraw the case and approach the Uttarakhand high court. Five years later, the Uttarakhand high court said the power to transfer a case from UP to Uttarakhand lies only with the Chief Justice of Allahabad high court. By allowing the petitioner to approach Uttarakhand high court, the Allahabad high court judge had “barged into” provisions of the UP Reorganisation Act, “adoring himself with the powers of the Chief Justice,” the Uttarakhand high court had said. By then, 19 years had passed and that, too, made it untenable, the Uttarakhand high court had added. The Supreme Court on Monday said the grounds on which the Uttarakhand high court judge dismissed the petition were not “tenable at law” and there was “no error” in the Allahabad high court’s decision. “The single judge of the high court of Uttarakhand is not at all justified in making comments upon the judicial order passed by the coordinate bench of the Allahabad high court,” the Supreme Court said, adding that the Uttarakhand high court judge was “not acting as an appellate court against the judicial order passed by the high court of Allahabad”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/sc-quashes-ukhand-hc-verdict-not-recognising-case-transferred-by-allahabad-hc/articleshow/86210242.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Ahmedabad||Covid shrank CNG sales in Gujarat by 13% in financial year 2021||AHMEDABAD: The compressed natural gas (CNG) sales in Gujarat contracted by 13% in 2020-21 as its consumption reduced due to the restricted vehicular movement following the imposition of curbs to tackle Covid. The provisional sales of CNG in the state declined to 6.49 lakh metric tonnes in April-March 2021 as compared to 7.45 lakh metric tonnes in April-March 2020. This is revealed in the data compiled by the petroleum planning and analysis cell (PPAC) of the Union ministry of petroleum and natural gas. City gas distribution (CGD) players attributed the reduction in CNG sales to the Covid-induced restrictions, especially the nation-wide lockdown imposed in the first quarter of the fiscal 2021. “The sales of CNG had taken a major hit during the April-June quarter of the last financial year, which impacted the overall sales in the entire year,” said a source in a city-based CGD company. In fact, CNG sales were down 32% in the first two quarters of 2020-21. The CNG sales in the state are primarily driven by autorickshaws, school vans, public transport, and cabs, including those operated by aggregators. While schools remained closed throughout the year, rickshaw movements were curtailed due to the lockdown and territorial restrictions to contain the subsequent waves of the pandemic, said industry players. The CNG sales, however, have improved because of the easing of restrictions after the second wave of Covid and vehicular movement getting back to almost normal. According to Crisil Ratings, sales volume of city gas is set to soar 25-27% in 2021-22. This includes CNG used by vehicles and piped natural gas (PNG) used by homes and industries. “The first quarter of this fiscal, unlike last year, saw far less impact of lockdowns on vehicular mobility and industrial activities as volumes were up 130% on-year though down 18% sequentially,” said Manish Gupta, senior director, Crisil Ratings. “We expect sustained recovery for the rest of the year, as both CNG and industrial PNG demand improve on a combination of higher economic activity and record price advantage against alternate fuels,” he added. “This will drive the overall demand by 25-27% this fiscal, even 8% above fiscal 2020 levels.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covid-shrank-cng-sales-in-gujarat-by-13-in-fy21/articleshow/86212486.cms||Kalpesh Damor

Sandeep Patil, the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation’s (MSRDC) executive engineer in charge of land acquisition for the project, said, “The deputy CM has asked us to explore the feasibility of a change in the route alignment. It will involve acquisition of some more land and will increase the ring road length by one km.” Patil said the MSRDC needed 142.75 hectare of land covering 11 villages in Maval tehsil for the ring road project.. “We have so far completed a joint measurement survey in two villages and have measured about 25.59 hectare land in Maval,” he added. On Monday, Pawar held a meeting in Mumbai with MSRDC officials and MLAs from Khed and Maval tehsils to discuss the issues relating to the proposed ring road. Members of the Shri Vitthal-Rukhmai Bhandara Dongar Trust and Warkari sect members have opposed the tunnel, because they feared it would disturb the sanctity of the hill, which is connected to the life and literature of Sant Tukaram Maharaj. Balasaheb Kashid, the trust’s president, said they were not against the project. “We equested political leaders and the MSRDC officials to change the road alignment to save the hill,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/dy-cm-for-study-on-tunnel-alternative-says-msrdc/articleshow/86212408.cms||Sandip Dighe

---||Meerut||National-level kho-kho player was killed by ‘drug addict’, say UP cops||BIJNOR: With the discovery of a rope, a shirt with two missing buttons and a slipper, police say they have solved the murder of the national-level kho kho player in Bijnor. A labourer who lives at Adampur village, 26, has been arrested for killing the woman, 24, after an attempt to rape her. Police said the man is addicted to smack, hash and alcohol. “Shahjad, who also goes by Khadim, has confessed to his crime. He is a labourer who used to unload goods from trains. He is married and has a two-month-old daughter. He knew she always took the route by the railway tracks to get home — it was shorter,” Bijnor SP Dharamveer Singh said at a press briefing. “On Friday, there was no work at the railway station. He took smack and was sitting by the pile of railway sleepers when the woman passed by around noon. In an attempt to rape her, he dragged her away. When she struggled, he panicked and strangled her with a rope. She died, he got scared and ran away.” Police said he took her phone because she was on a call when he attacked her — her screams and cries for help were recorded in a chilling audio clip her friend later shared with the police. The phone, whose location was last traced to Adampur village, has not been found. What police did go on was a rope they said they found at his house. It was not clear why he had the rope on him when the woman was passing by. Police added that they found a shirt with two missing buttons, which they believe was because of the struggle, and a slipper that matched one left at the spot. “There were injury marks on his body which he may have got during the struggle,” the SP added. Shahjad’s father Khaleel, meanwhile, said the injuries were from a fight Shahjad got into with his brother earlier. Khaleel sat in protest outside the Bijnor police station on Tuesday, demanding his release. The woman’s father, too, was not convinced. He said, as he has over the past few days, that she was a sportsperson and could not have been overpowered by just one man — there must have been others as well. Shahjad has been arrested and booked under sections 376 (rape), 302 (murder), 201 (concealing evidence) and 511 (offences punishable with life or other imprisonment) of the IPC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/natl-level-kho-kho-player-was-killed-by-drug-addict-say-cops/articleshow/86210254.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Mumbai||Wall blocking stormwater drain demolished by BMC||Mumbai: Heavy rain in the last few days seems to have prompted BMC to demolish an illegal sea protection wall being built by a tony Malabar Hill housing society as it obstructed the Rungtha Lane stormwater drain. A complaint was filed by civic stormwater drain department on September 13 and the ward office took action the next day. Brighton housing society allegedly started construction of the wall in July without coastal regulation zone clearance. Rahul Kadri, an architect and committee member of the housing society, said they had permission from the city collector but have now stayed the work. “We will start building the wall only after we get all permissions,” he said. Kadri said the construction was in line with a nearby slum, and protected the slum too. Activist Santosh Dhaonkar had filed a complaint in August with the city collector’s office and then local D ward office and Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority. He had alleged the construction was being carried out in the sea without permission. The additional collector stated in his report that a wall was bring constructed by the housing society but as the land was given on lease to the society it had to be ascertained if the construction was being carried out on land leased to the society or in the foreshore area of the coast. The additional collector’s office forwarded the complaint to the city survey office for further action. But heavy rain for the last few days, resulting in waterlogging, forced the stormwater drain department to file a complaint with the local ward office. The complaint stated, “During regular cleaning of Rungtha lane outfall it was observed that brick wall constructed near the outfall by Brighton society was obstructing the stormwater drain line... request to demolish the brick wall to facilitate the cleaning of the outfall.” Advocate Y P Singh said demolition of the wall was not enough. “The administration must display the rule of law and prosecute the society under section 15 of Environment Protection Act. The society cannot claim negative equality with slum-dwellers as they are aware and should have sought permission,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/wall-blocking-stormwater-drain-demolished-by-bmc/articleshow/86216089.cms||Clara Lewis

At least seven gangs operating here are selling the stuff in city while being based in other metros such as Bengaluru, Mumbai and New Delhi. “All the seven gangs are mostly into cocaine smuggling. Some are into MDMA also. After several arrests in Hyderabad, they have taken up a ‘hit and run’ model. They live in other metros and based on orders they come to Hyderabad, deliver and go back,” a top official of excise enforcement department said. Most of these traffickers have either jumped bail or are yet to be caught, according to Telangana excise enforcement dossier, a copy of which is available with TOI. One of the most prominent traffickers is the Ebuka gang against whom cases were registered with Golconda, Ameerpet, Nampally ad Musheerabad excise stations. The gang is headed by Divine Ebuka Suzee, a Nigerian, who hops between Hyderabad and Bengaluru. Several of his gang members are absconding, including one identified as Dandy who is believed to be in Mumbai. The gang’s supplier is a Brazilian who goes by the name Choose. Each gang operating in the city has connections in various parts of the country. The gang led by Bernard alias Ben has connections in Andhra Pradesh and Puducherry; the Ezhe Chidi and Saeed gang has Delhi and Goa links; Peterson gang, Chuks gang and Lesmm gang are operating from Bangalore and Mumbai. The gang led by Able Emmanuel Umudu and James Morrison includes five accused who are still absconding. These gangs sell each gram of cocaine for about Rs 6000-7000 in Hyderabad and other metros. While the cocaine being sold here originates from Mexican and Colombian drug cartels, heroin is being smuggled in from Afghanistan via South Africa and Qatar, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/drug-gangs-sell-in-city-return-to-other-metros-to-escape-cops/articleshow/86214814.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

For a miscalculated slip in the watering hole may prove costly for littering the Union Territory. So, even if you forget to take your delectable ‘bitings’, remember to carry your own trash bag as tossing an empty beer can carelessly now will earn you a Rs 500 fine for the first time and Rs 1,000 for repeat offender! The order was issued by Daman collector Rakesh Minhas on Tuesday aiming to prevent littering. Daman officials claim that such an order is a novel attempt to keep its public places clean by one of the oldest municipalities of the country. Officials of various government departments are authorised to collect the fine. Teams of these officials will keep watch at public and private places and catch and fine offenders on the spot. Officials of police, municipality, panchayat, excise and other departments have been assigned the responsibility. “A challan will be issued on the spot fine. The fine amount is kept minimum and the motive is to keep our beaches and other public places clean,” said a senior Daman administration officer. At present, teams of total 300 people keep the beaches and other public places clean. Daman administration found out that disposal of waste in some private open plots lead to blockage of waterways and rivulets, thereby creating an unhygienic condition in the area. This also leads to spread of diseases. “It is the responsibility of the land owners to keep their plots clean. They will have to undertake cleaning on a regular period and also ensure that outside people do not dispose of waste on the plot,” the official added. Daman recently organised a cleanliness drive on August 23. As an extension of the efforts the order for fine has been issued. Beaches, Parks and main roads have been redeveloped by Daman authorities in the recent past.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/eat-drink-and-carry-your-own-trash-while-in-daman/articleshow/86210307.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta

In the aftermath of the incident, there has been massive public outrage with many blaming police for allegedly failing to curb illegal sale of liquor and drugs in the area. Locals say the area has become a safe haven for anti-social elements and those involved in illegal activities. “If the police would have curbed the illegal sale of liquor in the area, the incident of the minor girl’s rape and murder may not have taken place. The accused is a habitual drunkard and is addicted to bad vices. Easy availability of liqour is a curse for the poor,” said Saleha Begum, a resident from the area. Locals have also alleged that nearly every other house has become a haunt for drunkards. They said that law enforcement agencies and the commissioner’s task force have failed in keeping tabs on anti-social elements. They added that sale of ganja, among other contraband, has become rampant in the area, attracting many youths. Previously, there were illegal LPG gas refilling units being run in the area, but through consistent crackdown by the civil supplies authorities and police the menace was controlled. In several operations, domestic and commercial LPG gas cylinders were seized which had been used for re-filling purposes. “There are no cordon and search operations being carried out in the area. Despite alerting the police several times, our issues have fallen on deaf ears. There is an urgent need for intensified police patrolling in the area,” said Vidya Sagar a local. Locals have said that illegal businesses are being carried out in the area in broad daylight and on the main roads. They alleged that prohibition and excise authorities have turned a blind eye to such problems.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/saidabad-colonies-a-den-of-illegal-activities-say-locals/articleshow/86214797.cms||---

Of total 10,164 buildings that are required to obtain fire NOC after due inspection by the Ahmedabad Fire & Emergency Services, there are 7,428 buildings which have got valid fire NOC on September 8. The high court has been directing the civic body to ensure that all such buildings should have fire NOC, particularly after a fire tragedy that killed eight Covid-19 patients in Shrey Hospital on August 6, 2020. The petitioner-advocate Amit Panchal filed a PIL and sought directions to the authorities for proper implementation of the fire safety norms. At the time of Shrey Hospital fire accident, there were many hospitals and clinics which did not have valid fire NOC. Later, fire accident in Rajkot’s Uday Shivanand Hospital killed five more Covid-19 patients. The high court issued strict orders to ensure fire safety provisions in hospitals. After the second wave of Covid-19, the state government adopted a soft approach and decided not to take any coercive action against defaulters of fire safety norms and BU permission at least till March 31, 2022 citing the pandemic. However, after the Supreme Court held the decision contrary to provisions of law, the government came out with a new notification saying that the fire safety norms would be strictly enforced. According to AMC data, the residential buildings have emerged as bigger defaulters on this count with more than 40% residential buildings – 1,453 out of 3,106 — not having the fire NOC.

Apart from ramps, features like Manikarnika Ghat gate, Jalasen entrance point, a Ganga view gallery, cafeteria and public utilities have been added later in this project in March and sent to the state government for approval. Talking to TOI on Tuesday, divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal said, “In anticipation of the government’s sanction, the process of tender for the features later added to the KV Dham project has been initiated.” Supervising KV Dham project, PWD executive engineer Sanjay Gore said, “The bid of participants in this tender process will be opened only after the arrival of government sanction for Rs 55 crores additional work.” Removal of some dilapidated buildings purchased later led to changes in the initially approved design of the project, especially at its entry points from ghats along the Ganga. Gore said, “Not only space for creating ‘Ganga view gallery’ was found, but the alignment of the approach road from the access points to KV Dham being created near Manikarnika, Jalasen and Lalita ghats was also changed. A cafeteria building, Manikarnika Gate, block-4 of shops and public utilities, additional ghat area at Jalasen Ghat, three ramps and 600m boundary wall were added to the project with an estimated budget of Rs 55 crore.” With the change in alignment, there will be a straight approach road and dedicated ramp from entry point up to the highest flood point from where escalator facility will be available, said the official. While a platform of 80m length and 11m width for construction of Ganga view gallery will enable the visitors to enjoy the view of the Ganga as well as corridor area, a lower platform will be utilized for events like Ganga aarti and cultural activities. Steps between both the platforms steps will be in pyramidal shape The formalities for seeking government approval were delayed due to the second wave of Covid-19, said the officials, expecting that the process of sanction and awarding of work for additional features will be finalised in a month. Deadline for completion of the work will be separate from the deadline of the initial work of the project, they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/tender-process-for-addl-work-of-kv-dham-project-begins/articleshow/86212541.cms||Rajeev Dikshit
---||Ahmedabad||Investors can trade in US stocks from Oct||Ahmedabad: In a move that would boost retail participation at Gujarat International Finance Tec-City (GIFT City) in Gandhinagar, the NSE International Exchange or NSE IFSC, a wholly owned subsidiary of National Stock Exchange India Ltd, is planning to launch an initiative in October that will allow Indian investors to buy and sell stocks of 50 US-listed companies like Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, Tesla, Facebook and Netflix, among others. To begin with, NSE IFSC aims to open 10,000 trading accounts, aimed at attracting millennials and HNIs. The entire trading, clearing, settlement and holding of US stocks will be in GIFT City under the regulatory structure of IFSC authority. “We plan to start with 50 US companies listed in the S&P top 500. The selection of some of these will be based on their market capitalization, while in some cases, it will be on the basis of liquidity. Many of them are favoured by the millennial generation. In the first four months of this fiscal, the National Stock Exchange saw 50 lakh new registrations on its platform. A large number of them are youngsters whom we aim to draw to NSE IFSC for investing in US stocks,” said Ravi Varanasi, president of NSE Group. Currently, one can open an international trading account through any of the foreign trading platforms to invest in US stocks or buy international mutual funds. With this new product, investors can hold the depository receipts in their demat account opened in GIFT City. The price discovery will also take place at NSE IFSC and arbitrage will also happen here in future. Depositories, banks and brokers have already started working with NSE IFSC to enable these investment products for Indian investors. About 60 broking firms have already set up their operations at GIFT City.. Zerodha, India’s largest trading platform by volume, is in the process of starting its operations at GIFT City and sees huge opportunity in NSE IFSC’s new initiative. The initiative is said to be a first of its kind at IFSC where Indian retail investors will be able to transact on NSE IFSC platform under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme limits prescribed by the Reserve Bank of India to the tune of $250,000 (Rs 1.84 crore approx) per financial year. Investors will be provided with an option to trade in fractional quantity/value compared to the underlying shares traded in US markets. The proposed framework will make US stocks affordable to Indian retail investors. NSE IFSC Clearing Corporation Limited will offer its robust risk management framework, facilitate clearing as well as settlement of all trades in depository receipts and provide settlement guarantee in respect to all trades executed on the NSE IFSC platform. “GIFT IFSC is becoming an important gateway for inbound and outbound investment. While we are seeing good growth in corporate business, the latest arrangement will allow larger retail participation in IFSC. We foresee GIFT IFSC becoming a household name with this new initiative and would bring in larger participation of intermediaries in IFSC,” said Dipesh Shah, Head Development, International Financial Services Centres Authority. He said the new initiative is expected to operationalize in October. “The ecosystem of banking and capital markets at GIFT IFSC is growing fast. We have seen a surge in businesses such as AIFs, PMS and stockbroking firms. The introduction of new products on international exchanges will provide good opportunities to retail investors” Tapan Ray, MD & Group CEO, GIFT City “Presently, if you want to buy international stocks, you have to get into unregulated areas through a US broker. The business model offered by NSE IFSC will provide safe investment opportunity to Indian investors which is easy and cheaper” Nithin Kamath, founder and CEO of Zerodha||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/investors-can-trade-in-us-stocks-from-oct/articleshow/86214872.cms||Maulik Pathak
---||Noida||YEIDA gets board’s nod to earmark land for Film City||Greater Noida: The Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) on Tuesday took the board’s approval to earmark a land parcel off the Yamuna Expressway in Sector 21 for developing Film City, the ambitious project of the Yogi Adityanath government.Though the Authority had already identified 220 acres for the project, the board’s approval was required before starting development work. The bid document is expected to be ready this week and the process of selecting the bidder will start after the papers are vetted by the legal department. The 220-acre land would be developed as part of the first phase.Among other key decisions taken at YEIDA’s second board meeting this year, the Authority decided to launch a one-time settlement scheme for allottees from October 1. “But this time, the scheme is going to be different from what it used to be in the past. We are going to waive the compounded amount,” said Arun Vir Singh, the chief executive officer of the development authority.Though all the three industrial development authorities in the region have been launching one-time settlement schemes, YEIDA’s plan is aimed at resolving the differences with allottees over the interest rate. The Authority will now levy only simple interest instead of compound interest.The simple interest that prevailed at the time of allotment will be considered to recalculate the due amount. Shailendra Bhatia, the head of the investment cell at YEIDA, said, “If the Authority commanded 8.5% interest on the premium, it would levy 11.5% compound interest at the end of the first default. For the second, a compound interest of 14.5% was levied. Basically, the default amount was compounded every six months. We are going to waive the compounded amount and levy only simple interest.”The officer said the due amount should come down significantly after the recalculation. The scheme, he added, would be offered up to November 30.Sources said the move would benefit about 32,000 allottees, including real estate groups that are executing group housing projects. YEIDA’s move is likely to put pressure on the Noida and Greater Noida authorities to introduce similar schemes. YEIDA, officials said that, it had also decided to get a drone survey done of the populated villages under its jurisdiction. The aerial survey will identify the houses in the villages and YEIDA will issue property cards to the families with demarcated boundaries. At the meeting, the layout of the proposed Medical Device Park was finalised too. Planned over 350 acres in Sector 28, only 90 acres will be developed in the first phase of the project. The size of the plots in the park will be kept between 1,000 and 10,000 sqmt and 89 such plots will be on offer.YEIDA also got an approval to launch the Data Centre Park over 100 acres in Sector 28. Heeding to the demands of entrepreneurs and individuals who had bought industrial and residential plots along the expressway, the Authority has decided to give time till December 31 to execute lease deeds. Moreover, an extension till March 2022 has been offered to complete construction work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/yeida-gets-boards-nod-to-earmark-land-for-film-city/articleshow/86214719.cms||Shalabh

The petitioner, the National Federation of the Blind, has sought HC directions to the state authorities calling for records relating to maintenance of the roster for giving effect to the 3% reservation for persons with disabilities in terms of the Persons With Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection or Rights And Full Participation) Act, 1995 and the Supreme Court’s judgment, and about the 2016 amendment that included a 1% quota for persons suffering from blindness and low vision.  Details have been sought for the period since 1996. The demand has been made to quash recruitments in which the 4% quota rule has not been followed. The PIL demanded that the government be directed to undertake a special recruitment drive to fill the backlog of vacancies for each category of disability, including blind persons and those with low vision separately. The government pleader sought time and informed the court that the general administration department and department of social justice are considering the issue and will come out with a solution soon. The court posted a further hearing for September 30, said the petitioner’s advocate, S H Iyer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/court-seeks-reply-on-quota-for-persons-with-disabilities/articleshow/86212535.cms||---

A case in point is Nagla Amaan village, where the first cases of dengue-like viral fever were reported last month. So far, 10 families have moved out following 12 fever-related deaths over the past three weeks. Some 200 residents are still battling with the fever but have no access to medical facilities as the the government health centre at the village is closed. Anshu Yadav, a grocery shop owner at Nagla Amaan, confirmed, “Ten families with five to 10 members each have left the village. The situation is the same at nearby villages. Almost every family in the village has a member suffering from dengue-like fever but proper treatment facilities do not exist.” Veeresh Kumar, a village elder, said, “People are dying without proper treatment. So far, 12, including four children have died. Families are either leaving or sending their children away to protect them.” He blamed local authorites for poor sanitation and waterlogging at the village, the main reasons for the infection. Farmer Satish Chand said, “The local authorities had swung into action ahead of the CM Yogi Adityanath’s visit last month. Cleanliness work was done on a largescale and free medicines were distributed. After that, there was no follow-up. Now, people are pawning their jewellery and cattle to raise money for treatment at private hospitals as government hospitals are full.” District magistrate Chandra Vijay Singh said, “We are running a cleanliness campaign across the district. Waterlogging is being cleared. Anti-larval spraying is also being conducted in the affected areas. A control room has been set up at the district-level and helpline numbers have been issued for time-bound action.” The DM said, “Doctors from some of the health centres in rural areas have been deployed at special camps for treatment of patients. Health facilities are being upgraded.” There are 64 active camps in the district and 4,800 people, including those suffering from fever, are undergoing treatment there, CMO Dinesh Kumar Premi said. Despite these efforts by the administration, the toll continues to rise in Firozabad. With six more deaths reported in the last 24 hours, the toll on Tuesday increased to 126. Out of these, 96 were children. Thirty-four critical patients were under treatment at the 18-bed emergency ward of the medical college. Besides, 540 more patients were undergoing treatment at designated wards for those suffering from viral fever and dengue-like symptoms. Two third of these patients were children, health department sources confirmed. The health department officials said, so far over 500 cases of dengue have been confirmed in Firozabad district. A few cases of malaria, scrub typhus (a bacterial illness spread by larval mite) and leptospirosis (a bacterial disease spread through the urine of infected animals) have also been reported. Diarrhoea has emerged as a new threat to children. This is posing a fresh challenge to hospitals with beds already full with patients.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/fearing-for-life-families-moving-out-of-fever-hit-firozabad-villages/articleshow/86210341.cms||Deepak Lavania

After a single-judge bench quashed SVNIT’s decision to expel the students for not meeting the minimum requirement of 25 points after the second semester after he skipped the tests, the institute filed an appeal and expressed grievances about certain observations made about the institute. The judges told SVNIT’s counsel that the student is a young boy of 18 years and the court would like to see that the student does not suffer. “We are compelled to take a view more as parents of the child and less as judges. We are requesting you to reconsider the case by treating it as a special case…We are concerned about the future of the child instead of the rules,” the judges said. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/treat-depressed-students-matter-as-special-case-hc/articleshow/86212561.cms||---

The farmers were to demand withdrawal of farm laws as well as remind PM Modi of his “promise” to set up a potato processing unit in Agra — the largest potato producing district in north India. Senior superintendent of Agra police, Muniraj G, confirmed to TOI that “some people were stopped from going to Aligarh on the basis of local intelligence”. “The action was taken to maintain the law and order situation at the PM’s event,” he said, without divulging details of how many people were detained. BKU leaders, however, said that 500 people were stopped from moving out of their homes and going to Aligarh. BKU Agra division president, Gajendra Singh Parihar, said, “Over 500 farmer leaders and BKU workers were detained by police in their homes. Farmers wanted to highlight various issues and demand withdrawal of the three contentious farm laws. We will attend rallies of the PM ahead of elections and raise our demands in a peaceful manner.” BKU district president Rajveer Lawaniya told TOI he was also detained on Tuesday. “Police and the local administration didn’t allow farmers to attend the PM’s rally. We were forcefully stopped in our homes even though we had assured the authorities that no disturbance will be created. We had plans to use pamphlets to raise our demands.” The farmers said they voted for the party in the last assembly elections but “got nothing in return”. BKU’s women wing leader, Savitri Chahar, said, “We trusted the PM and voted for the BJP. It is very upsetting that even after several promises, no efforts were made to establish a potato processing unit in Agra,” she said. In November 2013, Modi while addressing a mega rally at Kothi Meena Bazaar had spoken about the need for a potato processing unit in Agra where potato is grown in 75,000 hectares.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/over-500-farmer-leaders-bku-workers-say-detained-at-home-ahead-of-pms-aligarh-visit/articleshow/86210388.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Nagpur||Govt told to consider uniform med app||Nagpur: Acting on a petition filed by city-based pharmacist Arunpal Singh Behal, the Supreme Court has ordered the ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW) to look into his suggestions like development of a centralized portal for impartial hospitalization, supply of genuine medicines that too at appropriate rates and uniform charges for various tests during the pandemic. After filing the petition as the president of the SFS School Old Boys’ Association, Behal himself pleaded the case. In the order dated September 9, the bench comprising judges DY Chandrachud, Vikram Nath and Hima Kohli said, “Petitioner Behal, who appeared in person, suggested under Article 32 of the Constitution instituted during the course of the second wave of the pandemic that maintaining a centralized portal to disseminate real time information regarding essential ‘Covid commodities’ to ensure uniformity and transparency and to curb black marketing and hoarding of supplies. Since the petitioner has some suggestions, it would be appropriate to grant him liberty to move the ministry of health and family welfare for considering the suggestions, including the need for a centralized portal. His suggestions may be duly looked into at the appropriate level. The petition is disposed of as withdrawn, with the aforesaid liberty.” Behal told TOI that he has prepared a memorandum and will soon approach MoHFW for development of a centralized portal. “Our association has worked tirelessly during the first and second wave. We were able to help many people with hospitalization and supply of medicines. During the peak of the second wave, we felt helpless in managing beds as only a select few were getting them. Also, we were helpless when it came to supply of medicines as rampant black marketing prevailed at that time. Also, fake medicines were sold due to shortage. Laboratories and radiology centres charged different prices for the same tests. There is a centralized portal to get vaccinated at a government or private centre. Therefore, a centralized portal for hospitalization, medicines, tests etc is also possible. There should be one portal for the entire nation for medical services,” he said. Behal said, “I’m from the pharma field but had to file the petition as people lost their hard earned money due to lack of a proper policy, mismanagement by the government and the centralized portal. I have a franchisee of surgical instruments but will fight at any level to give justice to the people.” PETITIONER’S OBSERVATONS AND SUGGESTIONS * In second wave, people faced shortage of essentials which resulted in black marketing and sale of fake medicines * No uniform distribution of medicines and single reliable source for genuine products * System giving updated information was absent * Total chaos with people struggling for beds, oxygen, medicines etc * Common portal or app solution to problems * Government can monitor it * Portal/app will also ensure genuine, timely and updated info * Suppliers and consumers should be registered * Portal/app a modification of GST portal and Co-win app||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/govt-told-to-consider-uniform-med-app/articleshow/86212554.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Jabbed, Bhowanipore locals gear up to vote||KOLKATA: On April 26, when Bhowanipore went to assembly polls, many residents, especially senior citizens and those with co-morbidities, avoided casting their votes as that would have meant queueing up at booths and risking contraction of the novel coronavirus. But now that many of the families have already received their two doses of Covid vaccine, they seem emboldened and are keen on visiting the polling booths on September 30, the day for by-election. Bhowanipore is a melting pot of communities, with very old Bengali families residing there for generations, along with Gujarati and Punjabi households, both old-timers and new-comers. The poll excitement, that was somewhat missing during the assembly elections earlier this year, has caught on, thanks to the fact that a large section of residents have completed their vaccine regimen, which recipients feel would keep the disease severity in check even if they do catch the virus. Seventy-two-year-old cloth merchant Dinesh Dattani and his wife Hansa had skipped the polls last time because they hadn’t been jabbed. Though they don’t have any co-morbidity, they did not want to take a chance. “Now, we have taken both the doses and will definitely vote. Last time, we were sad but we didn’t want to take a risk,” Dattani said. Rukmaniben Popat, a resident of Rammoy Road, was down with Covid when the elections took place and so, was confined indoors. “I missed the election. But this time during the by-elections, I am vaccinated and am looking forward to voting,” she said. Many, however, said they might be vaccinated and would themselves follow all Covid-safety protocols, they expected the Election Commission to ensure distancing was maintained at the booths and that no none was allowed without a mask. Most said that last time, there was a lot of compartmentalisation of booths that helped control the crowd and they expected this to happen this time, too. “My booth is Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay’s house on Ashwini Dutta Road. Last time, the fear of contracting the novel coronavirus had kept me from casting vote. But now that I have got both my doses of the Covid vaccine, I will go out and vote. But I expect people to behave responsibly in the queue because vaccination is not a guarantee that I won’t catch the virus. It can only keep the intensity of the disease low,” said former Indian cricketer Saradindu Mukherjee. His 82-year-old father, Purnendu Mukherjee, too, have received both the jabs and is likely to go out to vote. A group of senior citizens of Bhowanipur, who have formed Mahila Mahal, that carries out social work and also conducts Durga Puja, has members who did not participate in the elections last time. But they had now been vaccinated now and planned to cast their vote, said president of the group, Swapna Mukherjee. “We are all seniors and are at risk from Cobid. But now that we are vaccinated, we are trying to make a fresh start, of course with precautions,” she said. Harish Mukherjee Road resident Sandip Banerjee had voted last time despite not being vaccinated at that time. “I wanted to do my duty as a citizen, but I carried my sanitiser and was very careful. I went to the booth when the crowd had thinned. This time, I am vaccinated and that gives me more confidence but that doesn’t mean I will let my guard down,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/jabbed-bhowanipore-locals-gear-up-to-vote/articleshow/86212617.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

Earlier on Sunday, police had nabbed a BDS student Juli Kumari, who was allegedly impersonating the actual candidate, and her mother in this connection. Commissioner of police, A Satish Ganesh, said that Dr Osama, a native of Mau district, who had appeared in MBBS final year exam at KGMU Lucknow this year, used to find aspirants on behalf of Patna-based solvers’ gang. “This gang used to take contracts to send impersonators to appear in the entrance exam. In case a candidate qualifies for the exam, the gang charges anything from Rs 30 lakhs to Rs 40 lakhs from the candidate,” he added. The CP said that Mehta is the brother of arrested BDS-II student Juli Kumari. He had convinced Juli to appear in NEET exam in place of an aspirant from Tripura -- Hena Biswas -- after getting a proposal of Rs 5 lakh from the solvers’ gang’s Vikas Kumar Mahto. “Police have recovered copies of 15 admit cards, four photos of aspirants, four receipts of couriers, two mobile phones containing chatting of gang members, details of money transaction and other items,” he added. “Both the persons arrested on Tuesday have divulged the names of the members of their gang belonging to UP, Bihar and other states. Several teams of police have been formed to nab the other members as well as the kingpin of the gang,” he informed TOI. On Sunday, a crime branch team had raided a NEET exam centre at St Francis Xavier School in Sona Talab area under the limits of Sarnath police station in afternoon session and caught Juli Kumari, who was appearing in the exam in the name of Hena Biswas of Tripura. The cops had also nabbed Juli’s mother Babita Devi of Patna. However, gang member Vikas Kumar Mahto of Khagaria district, who was accompanying Babita and Juli, managed to escape. An FIR was lodged under section 419 (cheating by personation), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 467 (forgery), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (fraudulently or dishonestly uses as genuine any document which he knows or has reason to believe to be a forged document)and 34 (criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of the common intention) of IPC against them with Sarnath police. During police investigation it came to light that a Patna-based person, who is known by his initials PK, is the leader of this interstate gang, while Osama used to hunt for candidates. Though the police succeeded in nabbing Osama and other members, reaching PK is proving to be a difficult task as he rarely uses phones and prefers to communicate through courier and travels by trains only.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/neet-solvers-gang-kgmu-medico-held/articleshow/86212600.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

---||Chennai||Madras high court asks if moving education to Concurrent List was legal||CHENNAI: A day after the Tamil Nadu assembly passed a bill to circumvent NEET for admissions to medical courses, the Madras high court wondered if the Emergency-era transfer of education as a subject from the State List to the Concurrent List amounted to tinkering with the basic structure of the Constitution. The court also remarked that the 42nd constitutional amendment of 1976 had not taken education out of the state’s purview entirely, as it is still on the Concurrent List and not under the Union List. “Even though the matter was taken away from one list to another, there was no complete takeover of the subject as such,” said the first bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice P D Audikesavalu on Tuesday. The court made the observations while hearing a public interest writ petition filed by Aram Seyya Virumbu Trust, represented by DMK legislator Dr Ezhilan Naganathan, questioning the constitutionality of the 42nd amendment. “By virtue of transferring the subject of education from List II to List III, the States’ executive/ legislative autonomy in matters of education has become subservient to Union’s executive/legislative powers,” the PIL said. Admitting the petition, the first bench observed: “Vast number of places do not have medical institutions. Why should MBBS dreams of students in certain states, where there are no medical colleges, remain unfulfilled just because the state does not have a medical college?” Batting for ‘equitable distribution’ of educational resources, the court said: “One can respect the sentiments of the petitioner but, at the same time, please remember we have vast parts of this country where they continue to be kind of underdeveloped without the resources that other places have … Therefore, there has to be a certain amount to equitable distribution of the educational resources or making it available to students from places where it may not be so readily available. “Even now, unfortunately, we don’t consider people from northeast as mainstream Indians, which is a tragedy because of their looks we call them Nepalese or Chinese. But they are also as much Indian as you and I,” the court said. “They come from places where such infrastructures are not available, so we must consider all of them,” the court added, and directed the Union government to respond to the plea in eight weeks. The court then suo motu impleaded the Tamil Nadu government as a party-respondent and directed the state to report its views.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/hc-asks-if-moving-education-to-concurrent-list-was-legal/articleshow/86212657.cms||Suresh Kumar

Among them, six companies will be deployed in Bhowanipore, while the rest will head for Murshidabad. Election Commission (EC) officials said that these 15 companies will be part of the 52 companies of central forces that will be on duty during the Bengal by-polls. The 15 companies will comprise seven companies of CRPF and four companies of BSF, along with two companies of SSB and one company of CISF and ITBP each. Earlier, EC officials had held a meeting with state officials about the law-and-order situation in Bengal, particularly in areas that are going in for by-elections. The EC has already deployed poll observers and set up a flying squad of the income tax department to track any illegal cash carrier. On Sunday, a person was arrested by the RPF at Howrah station for carrying Rs 45 lakh as he failed to provide any satisfactory explanation for the hugh amount of cash on him. I-T official interrogated the person, Bhagirathi Sinha, a resident of Raipur, Chhattisgarh. In Kolkata, state police are likely to be deployed 200 metres from polling booths. On election day, several quick response teams—comprising central force personnel—will be on the rounds, with local cops acting as guides. Besides, RT vans and sector mobiles will be on the roads. Kolkata Police for the first time will not use the Police Training School premises to house the central forces. “The PTS is being used as a vaccination-cum-monitoring centre. So, we have decided to put up the three companies arriving early for area domination at other police properties, including the one at Dumurjola,” an officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/15-central-force-cos-start-arriving-for-pre-poll-watch/articleshow/86212692.cms||Debasish Konar

In a statement, NHRC said it has asked the National Disaster Management Authority, Union ministry of home affairs and the Union health ministry to submit reports with respect to the "adverse impact of farmers agitation on various aspects and observance of Covid protocols at the protests sites". The commission also directed the Institute of Economic Growth (IEG) to examine the adverse impact of the farmers agitation on industrial and commercial activities and production, and disruption of transport services on commercial and normal consumers, including inconvenience and additional expenditure, among others and asked it to submit a comprehensive report by October 10. Additionally, NHRC asked the Delhi School of Social Work to depute teams to conduct a survey and submit a report, assessing the disruption of livelihood, lives of people, impact on the aged and infirm persons due to protracted agitation by farmers, the rights panel said. "The NHRC has received several complaints regarding the ongoing farmers protest. There are allegations of adverse impact on the industrial units, seriously effecting more than 9,000 micro, medium and large companies," it said. The rights panel said it has been informed that transportation has also been adversely impacted, causing commuters, patients, people with disability and senior citizens to suffer due to heavy traffic on roads where farmers are sitting in protest of the contentious farm laws.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/nhrc-notice-to-4-states-centre-over-farmers-stir/articleshow/86217688.cms||---
---||Kolhapur||Mills to start cane crushing from Oct 15||Kolhapur: The high-powered state ministerial committee has fixed October 15 as the date from when sugar mills can start crushing sugar cane for the 2021-22 season. The committee, led by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, has also decided to file criminal offences against the directors of the mills if they start crushing sugar cane before October 15. Already, there is a provision to impose a hefty fine on such factories. The committee fixes the date in consultation with the stakeholders of the industries so as to ensure a level-playing field for all. For 2020-21, 146 mills have cleared 100% dues of the cane growers. The committee has decided not to allow mills, which have not paid the sugar cane farmers as per the fair and remunerative price (FRP), to start crushing. The crushing licence is issued through the sugar commissionerate. Due to floods and continuing rainfall in the south Maharashtra region, which is considered as the sugar bowl of the state, the mills are likely to start the crushing season late. Ganpatrao Patil, chairman of Shri Dutta Shirol Cooperative Sugar Factory, said, “Due to the floods, the sugar cane in our area has been damaged. Also, the rainfall is still on and it will be difficult to harvest. Most mills are therefore likely to start crushing at full capacity little later than the date fixed by the committee.” In the July floods, suagr cane grown on 60,000 hectare in Kolhapur district was damaged. Large tracts of sugar cane fields from Sangli and Satara districts too were damaged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/mills-to-start-cane-crushing-from-oct-15/articleshow/86208034.cms||---

As per the details, around 854 students of grade XII of GIC who have been recently promoted without exams due to Covid were protesting for a few days as their online mark sheet did not show any marks. As a result they were having difficulty in getting admission in Colleges. Sources reveal this happened as the school authorities had failed to submit the internal marks at the Board office. The protest was getting aggressive day by day and to solve the issues, a meeting was held between the SDM Sadar, Santosh Upadhyay, Principal GIC and some student leaders in the school office. In-between hundreds of students entered the school premises and locked the authorities inside the room and started protesting aggressively. As the police were informed, heavy force arrived and started lathi charge to disperse the crowd. The matter became more tense after a video went viral in, which some men were seen attacking the students with burning wooden sticks. Meanwhile it was alleged that some police officials also misbehaved with the media persons who were present at the scene and were asking the officials who had ordered for the lathi charge on the students. On Tuesday, a number of political parties staged a protest and submitted their memorandum to DM Lalitpur, Annavi Dinesh Kumar against the lathi Charge on the students. On the other hand a group of media persons also lodged their complaint to the DM against the misbehaviour of the police. By evening DM Lalitpur ordered an enquiry of the whole incident by a three member committee consisting of ADM Judicial, Rajnish Rai, District Social Welfare Officer, Abhishek Awasthi and District Minority Welfare Officer, Dilip Kumar. On the other hand SP Lalitpur, Nikhil Pathak informed that he has ordered a separate enquiry of the incident. “It seems that some miscreants had also entered the premises who, under the camouflage of students, were trying to create unrest”. Talking to TOI, DM Lalitpur said, “In all 1090 students from the district of, which 877 are from GIC who have not got marks as the school authorities could not get the pre board exams done because of covid. Almost over one lakh such students are there in the entire state. Seeing this, the government has decided to conduct another exam which will start from 18th. I have ordered an enquiry”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/students-lock-up-sdm-and-school-principal-in-lalitpur/articleshow/86212682.cms||Arindam Ghosh
---||Ahmedabad||When Gujarat CM Bhupendra Patel said egos must be shed in Gandhinagar!||AHMEDABAD: The popular belief is that people with fat egos and deep pockets can easily walk into the power corridors of Gandhinagar and get things done in a jiffy. But the new chief minister is of the view that egos go for a toss and people have to be humble when working with the government in the state capital. In a video that has gone viral, Bhupendra Patel, the newt chief minister of Gujarat and an ardent follower of the spiritual guru Dada Bhagwan, is seen sharing his life experiences at Trimandir at Adalaj a few months ago. “People who go to Gandhinagar have to shed their ego. We have to go to government departments for work and so I know this,” he says.  “You cannot keep a fat ego and go there for work. People have to shed their ego before heading for Gandhinagar.”  He says this in a video address where he is seen speaking before Deepakbhai Desai, the spiritual guru who heads the Dada Bhagwan Foundation. Little would Patel have imagined while giving this speech that he will soon be at the top post in Gandhinagar, beating several senior BJP leaders. In the short video clip, Bhupendra Patel says that he was infected with Covid-19 and it took about two months to recover. “This gave me an opportunity to read two books of Dada Bhagwan. After reading them I realized that had I not read them I would have really missed something very important in my life,” he says. “When reading them, I felt as if Dada Bhagwan was narrating them to me in person.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/when-bhupendra-patel-said-egos-must-be-shed-in-gnagar/articleshow/86215001.cms||---
---||Agra||UP great example of double engine govt’s benefits, says PM Narendra Modi||ALIGARH/LUCKNOW: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday laid the foundation stone for a university in Aligarh named after Jat king Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh and hailed Uttar Pradesh as a “great example of the double-engine government’s double benefit”, virtually sounding the BJP’s poll bugle for the 2022 assembly elections in the state. Paying tributes to the Jat leader, the PM said, “It is unfortunate that contributions of many icons towards nation building were ignored for decades by earlier regimes. But today Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh ji is being given the importance he truly deserves.” The BJP has long rued that Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) has not done enough to honour the memory of Singh who donated a portion of the land in which AMU is set up. The decision to set up the university — which will span over 92 acres and provide affiliation to 395 colleges of the Aligarh division — is also being seen by many as an effort to appease the Jat community that has been present in large numbers during the ongoing farmers' protest against new farm laws. Jats, many of them on the dais as leaders, recently organised a well-attended kisan mahapanchayat in Muzaffarnagar, with Aligarh next door and a part of the west UP neighbourhood. The community could sway elections in several constituencies as it adds up to about 17% of the population in 26 districts of west UP, accounting for 136 of 403 assembly seats. Modi touched upon farmers’ issues in his 40-minute speech. “Eight of 10 farmers in India have a small piece of land, measuring two hectares or less. The Centre is making continuous efforts to empower them and stand with them as partners,” he said, while highlighting schemes rolled out by the government such as minimum support price (MSP), kisan credit cards and crop insurance for farmers. He said the UP government has worked towards resolving issues of cane farmers for the past four years. The PM praised chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s efforts to “end mafia raj” and put UP on the path of development. “Till 2017, UP was infamous for its mafia-raj, with gangsters and gundas having a free run. But Yogi ji has ended all this and put gangsters in the place they belong — jail,” he said. Taking a jibe at the opposition, he said that people “cannot forget the scams that took place before the BJP came to power”. Modi said that earlier there were roadblocks in the implementation of welfare schemes meant for the poor, but the “double-engine government” – led by the BJP in the state and at the Centre – had led to “double benefits”. The prime minister also inaugurated the Aligarh node of the Uttar Pradesh Defence Industrial Corridor. The establishment of the corridor was announced in 2018. A total of six nodes — Aligarh, Agra, Kanpur, Chitrakoot, Jhansi and Lucknow — have been planned. Recalling an anecdote from his childhood, Modi said he knew about Aligarh because a Muslim man from Aligarh would often visit his village to sell locks. “Aligarh, which was known to manufacture locks for securing houses, will play an important role in securing the country's borders in the 21st century,” he said. Modi said that with the establishment of the defence corridor, India would soon be in a position to export defence equipment. “India will not only become self-reliant in defence matters but also become a major exporter in this sector,” he said, announcing Rs 9,000 crore for the development of BrahMos missile at the defence corridor.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/pm-lays-foundation-stone-for-univ-in-aligarh-named-after-jat-king/articleshow/86210482.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: New ministers’ council to be sworn in soon||GANDHINAGAR: The suspense over who will retain their place in the cabinet of newly appointed chief minister Bhupendra Patel and which of the sitting ministers will be axed to pave way for younger, fresher faces will become clear as Patel’s council of ministers will take oath soon. The governor’s office or the chief minister’s office (CMO) is, however, yet to announce a formal schedule of the swearing-in ceremony of the council of ministers. In the intervening period, a quiet unease gripped the state capital amidst broad hints that senior ministers could be dropped. Speculation was rife over a flurry of activities late on Tuesday by aggrieved leaders who apprehend that they could be dispensed. There were reports of many senior leaders reaching out to each other over the apprehension of an impending, unceremonious exit from the cabinet. Although deputy chief minister Nitin Patel has openly stated that he fully supported the decision of naming Bhupendra Patel as CM, he was visibly emotional when asked about the decision. Patel, who was passed for a second time for the top post in the state, could become a rallying point for some senior leaders who are reeling under the insecurity of suddenly being rendered dispensable. Earlier, in 2017, Nitin Patel had refused to take charge of the portfolios assigned to him as he was not given the finance portfolio. A sulking Nitin Patel was then given the portfolio after intervention from senior BJP leader Amit Shah. Key sources in the ruling party said the new cabinet will be a balancing act representing regions, castes and communities and that younger MLAs are likely to be inducted into the cabinet. Although top leaders of the BJP held a series of meetings to finalise members of the new cabinet, until Tuesday evening, none of the MLAs had been formally summoned to Gandhinagar to prepare for the swearing-in. Sources said, “Earlier, the new cabinet was expected to be sworn in by Wednesday, but the ceremony will now be held later. CM Bhupendra Patel, state BJP president C R Paatil and Gujarat BJP incharge Bhupendra Yadav, who has been camping in the state over the weekend, held several meetings with Amit Shah. Patel, Paatil and Yadav also had meetings with the MLAs who are hopeful of getting a cabinet berth. So far though, none of the MLAs have been formally summoned for preparations of their entry into the cabinet.” Commenting on what is expected next, sources said, “After preparing a list of probables, the CM and Paatil will discuss it with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah. Most of the MLAs who will be finalised for a cabinet berth will be informed soon.” “The names of those who will be in the council of ministers will be made public soon.” Balancing act focus on inclusivityA key source said, “As former CM Vijay Rupani is no longer at the helm of affairs, representation from Saurashtra will increase. In order to be inclusive, a few cabinet ministers and ministers of state are expected to be dropped and OBC MLAs are likely to be given ministerial berths. At the same time, a couple of MoS-rank ministers are likely to be elevated to cabinet rank.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/new-ministers-council-to-be-sworn-in-soon/articleshow/86215667.cms||Kapil Dave
---||Agra||Who was Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh?||For 20 years, Mahendra Pratap Singh lived a charmed life. Born to Maharaja Ghansham Singh Bahadur of Hathras in 1886, his days passed with “dancing girls and wine”. Everything changed in 1906, when he attended an Indian National Congress meet in Calcutta. He came home and declared he was a Swadeshi. With that began the Jat king’s pursuit of a pan-Asian insurrection against the British. “He was convinced that the struggle for India’s freedom could not be fought from within the country,” wrote South Asia historian Carolien Stolte, chronicling his global voyage to secure support for overthrowing the British, visiting Moscow, Kabul, Beijing and Tokyo. He set up India’s first “government”, tried raising an “Asian army” and was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1932. Singh was incarcerated as a war criminal when the Americans occupied Japan. After decades in exile, he won a Lok Sabha election, defeating Atal Bihari Vajpayee from Mathura in 1957. His wayfaring life began with the Balkan War in 1912. His classmates from Mohammedan Anglo-Oriental College, now Aligarh Muslim University, had gone to the front but he was late and Turkey didn’t let him go any further. But he travelled to Berlin in 1915 and, as a sympathiser of Germany against Britain in World War I, went to the front as a visitor. That year, he left for Afghanistan and established the Provincial Government of India. It was a “government-in-exile”. By 1920, he had become an Afghan citizen — so he couldn’t be arrested outside British territory — and was an unofficial envoy for the country. Singh had given up some of his property so a technical college could be set up in Vrindavan. He also arranged for a lease of land to his alma mater for a school in 1929, starting a journal, ‘World Federation’, in which he spoke of an Asia-led new world order. In his map, India would be part of the “Aryan” district, one of five in Asia, going all the way from Persia and Afghanistan to Assam. To achieve this, he dreamt of an “Asian army” and set up recruitment centres in Tokyo, Dairen and Tsingtao in Japan, Stolte writes. Not much came of it. In 1938, the All India Jat Mahasabha shot off petition after petition to get him back to India from Japan. When he did, he was a spent man. He died in 1979 at Hathras. He was 93.

Currently,a single ember can be elected from a constituency. The cabinet is in favour of two members being elected from each constituency. The government is now considering multi-member constituencies for municipal corporations excluding Mumbai. This will give an opportunity for more contestants from each constituency. The former BJP-led government had mandated multi-member constituencies, but this decision was reversed by MVA after it came to power. The State Election Commission said the decision on multi-member constituencies for councils will not result in pushing forward local body polls. “In most cases, constituency boundaries do not have to be redrawn, so it is unlikely to lead to postponement. If government asks for boundaries to be redrawn, SEC will have to take a view,” said a senior official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-mva-cabinet-for-2-member-seats-in-civic-council-polls/articleshow/86216126.cms||---

As per SP GRP Jhansi, Mohd Imran, all the three accused were brought here on transit remand on Monday. They have been identified as Mohd Rafi (23), Sanjay Kumar (29) and Yashpal Sharma (25), all native of district Rajouri of Jammu. During interrogation it was revealed that they have been working with one Real Security Services in Hyderabad. In due course of time they came to know that some persons from Jammu who were working with other such companies were recently caught by Kerala police for possessing fake licenses. As a result they got scared and thought to leave the place. All of them took leave and left with their arms and ammunition. Meanwhile two of their associates who had already left for Jammu few days ago also asked them to carry their arms. The license of one of them had expired in the month of May while the other one is under scrutiny. They further revealed that when police caught the bags, they were present inside the compartment but could not muster courage to claim their baggage. Later on they decided to go the their native place and lodge a complaint of missing weapons but were caught in the mid way. As per SP GRP, “We have sent a team to Rajouri to nab the rest of the two accused and further investigate the details. Meanwhile we have come to know that one of the absconding accused Majid has a pending case of 2005 against him lodged in Rajouri under section 341, 452, 382 IPC. We are trying to trace the past history of all the accused”. Sources reveal that a number of such persons from Jammu working in security agencies in various districts of South India have recently returned in various trains to their native place under fear of getting caught due to having wrong papers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/3-arrested-in-connection-with-abandoned-arms-found-in-train/articleshow/86212723.cms||Arindam Ghosh

Karnataka Sangrama Seva president Sanjeev Dumanal said the Centre is imposing Hindi in the name of national language policy on non-Hindi speaking states. “Hindi is used in all competitive exams in the country. Each state has its own mother tongue and culture. But the central government is trying to insult and destroy regional languages, including Kannada,” he said. Terming the move to impose Hindi as an anti-Kannada policy, Dumanal said all Kannada organisations will intensify the agitation against the Centre. The protesters said the Union government should stop celebrating this dark day as Hindi Diwas and give equal respect to mother tongue of each state, including Kannada. They later submitted a memorandum addressed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the tahsildar. In Dharwad, KRV (Swabhimaan and Shivarame Gowda faction) and Jaya Karnataka took out separate rallies and staged demonstrations in front of the SBI Main branch and also deputy commissioner's office. KRV leader Papu Dhare said that nationalised banks have made Hindi as an administrative language. This is an insult to Kannada in Karnataka. The state government has ordered making Kannada administrative language and the banks too should follow it, he said. Challans, receipt and other forms should be printed in Kannada and the bankers should be asked to compulsorily speak in Kannada, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/kannada-activists-oppose-hindi-day-celebration/articleshow/86210577.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi Disaster Management Authority likely to give nod for business exhibitions||NEW DELHI: Traders and people associated with the exhibition and event industry in Delhi may get a huge relief soon, as Delhi Disaster Management Authority is likely to permit business-to-customer exhibitions. DDMA is also likely to order continuation of schools for senior classes (IX to XII). A DDMA order is expected on Wednesday. A Delhi government official said DDMA would take a final decision about permitting reopening of schools for VI to VIII. However, according to sources, the reopening of these classes may take little more time. Chamber of Trade & Industry (CTI) chairman Brijesh Goyal said while business-to-business exhibitions were permitted in Delhi after Covid-19 situation improved, business-to-customer exhibitions were still banned. “The government is likely to give relaxations to the exhibition and event industry, which will help hundreds of exhibition traders and thousands of people directly or indirectly associated with them. About 40,000 people are estimated to be associated with the industry in Delhi,” said Goyal. Led by the CTI chairman, a group of traders associated with the industry recently met health and industry minister Satyendar Jain and senior DDMA officials with request to allow business-to-customer exhibitions and events. “There are no restrictions on business-to-customer exhibitions in Noida, Gurgaon and Ghaziabad due to which so many events have been shifted to these neighbouring cities. Delhi government is also losing revenue because of this,” said Goyal. The traders have been demanding that because the Covid situation has improved in the city and weekly markets, cinemas, schools, metro, malls, markets, etc., have been permitted to open, exhibitions and events should also be permitted. “It will create thousands of jobs because tent, light, camera, sound and mic, food, catering, decorators and security services are directly connected to this industry,” said Goyal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ddma-likely-to-give-nod-for-business-exhibitions/articleshow/86212794.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Flooded Roads, Floating Cars A Regular Monsoon Affair||Madhapur Issue: As heavy rains lashed the city in October last year, scary visuals of flooding surfaced from Hyderabad’s Madhapur area, which houses IT and pharma companies, in addition to gated communities. Resident’s cry: From the past two-three years, the road adjacent to Nectar Gardens gets inundated every time it rains. Several cars were submerged in October when the city experienced rains like never. I hope the government will do something about the roads in Hyderabad —T Akhilesh | a resident of madhapur Expert solution: In 2016, the Telangana Assembly Estimate Committee found that nearly 60 acres near Durgam Cheruvu has been encroached. There are also several recent encroachments not just in the lake FTL area but also the Shaikpet nala which is under dispute from a very long time. These issues have to be resolved by removing encroachments and ensuring that proper engineering is done to restore the inlet and outlet channels —Jeevan Kumar | a civil engineer ..................................... Bowenpally Issue: Many areas surrounding the Ramannakunta lake at Bowenpally in Secunderabad Cantonment reported heavy water logging in July this year. There are as many as 20 residential colonies facing flood threat as water level in the lake rises dangerously with every spell of rain. Resident’s cry: Our troubles have been continuing for nearly three decades now. We don’t know when they would be permanently resolved. Earlier, it was just the roads that used to get inundated. Now, the water gushes into our houses, further adding to our miseries. The problem is only worsening with every passing year —Geeta Kumari | a resident of sitarampur in bowenpally Expert solution: The Rammanakunta lake, Hasmathpet lake and RK Puram lake are all interconnected. There is flooding in the surrounding areas because the inlet and outlet nalas have been encroached. The authorities should ensure that the encroachments on nalas are removed and the network of nalas must be restored —Thakur Rajkumar Singh | environmental activist ............................................. Tolichowki Issue: Tolichowki’s Nadeem colony and Baba Nagar bore the brunt of all the major extreme rainfall events in the last two decades. The area suffers massive flooding. Many lanes in these colonies turned into rivulets as two-wheelers, cars and in some cases even people were seen floating. Resident’s cry: In October last year, the rains increased water level in the inlet nalas and Shah Hatim Talab (lake) as the entire water from the upstream flowed down. Our houses got inundated as the water level gradually rose till the ceiling, almost 10-12 feet high, causing massive destruction. Even now, due to the rains in the last few days, the drains in the area are once again overflowing -- Mohammad Hameed, a resident of Nadeem Colony. Expert solution: The GHMC has recently carried out de-silting and cleared the choked outlet channels by setting up a temporary bund with sandbags, which is a short-term solution to the problem. The only permanent solution is to remove encroachments in the lake and on channels and activate the defunct culvert that was built a few years ago -- P Ramakrishna, a civil engineer Saroornagar Issue: Several families experienced a repeat of last year’s monsoon nightmare as areas around Saroornagar lake — among the worst-affected by rain-induced floods last year — were inundated once again this year. Kondaram Nagar and Seesala Basthi were among the worst affected as surplus water from the lake exceeded the capacity of the drains meant to carry it to Musi river. Resident’s cry: There are as many as 1,800 to 2,000 families that suffer inundation every time it rains in this area. Most of the drains are clogged and obstruct free flow of excess water from the lake and upstream areas -- Kota Sai Kumar, member of a resident welfare association in P&T Colony Expert solution: Flooding in the areas around Saroornagar lake is mainly due to surplus water from surrounding areas such as Meerpet, Kapula Cheruvu, BN Reddy Nagar and Balapur being diverted to the residential colonies in low-lying areas. The storm water drain carries water from Meerpet, Bandlaguda and surrounding areas up to a spot in Karmanghat and leaves it there causing flash floods. To arrest the flooding in this area, we need to construct a drain pipeline under the strategic nala development programme of the GHMC. Plans are afoot for the project and once it concludes, water from upstream areas will follow its natural course to Musi without causing any floods -- H Krishnaiah, GHMC LB Nagar zone deputy commissioner GFX Issue VS solution · The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) has identified 28,872 encroachments on major nalas flowing through 390 km length in its limits · Of the 28,000 unauthorized constructions identified last year, the civic body concluded that 1,001 structures in 47 critical bottlenecks are to be removed immediately to avoid inundation during heavy rains. But till July this year, there has been no major drive or attempt to remove the encroachments except taking up the removal of bottlenecks at some isolated places · Initiating steps to prevent flooding of low-lying areas, the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) has decided to acquire 260 properties by paying compensation of over Rs 80 crore towards development of storm water drains across the city · In an effort to fix the city’s drainage system, GHMC’s nala development wing’s strategic nala development programme (SNDP) was rolled out in November, 2020 post the floods that wreaked havoc in the city · Though 260 properties with a combined extent of 23,000 square yards have been listed for acquisition through the legal route, GHMC is making efforts to acquire properties through negotiations wherever possible under the GHMC Act QUOTES Under phase 1 plan, 15 packages have been sanctioned under strategic nala development programme (SNDP) for Rs 858 crore.

Blaming ‘overspeeding’ for most road accidents, a division bench of Justice N Kirubakaran (since retired) and Justice T V Thamilselvi refused to accept the stand taken by the Union government that the speed limit had been fixed by an expert committee considering improvement in infrastructure and better engine technology of vehicles. “When overspeeding is a major cause for road accidents, it is not known as to how improvement in road infrastructure and engine technology would reduce accidents,” asked the bench. In fact, better engine technology would always be a reason for uncontrolled speed and thereby cause more accidents, the court added. It said authorities must use modern gadgets like speed gun, speed indication display and drones to find out speeding vehicles and punish drivers. “Violators of road traffic rules should be strictly punished in accordance with law. Vehicles with high speed engines should be calibrated in such a manner the vehicle does not exceed the permitted speed limit,” the court said. The court passed the orders while increasing the compensation awarded to a lady dentist who sustained 90% disability in a road accident and her two children. The court enhanced Rs 18.4 lakh awarded by a tribunal to Rs 1.5 crore. In 2013, while the victim was riding her two-wheeler on Kancheepuram road, an MTC bus, which was driven in a rash and negligent manner, hit her. Disposing of the plea, the judges suggested that the government to constitute special courts to deal with traffic offences and accident claim cases, so that criminal cases arising out of the accident and the claim arising out of the same accident could be dealt with by the special courts together comprehensively.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/hc-cuts-speed-limit-to-80kmph-from-120kmph/articleshow/86212753.cms||Suresh Kumar
---||Hyderabad||Vijay Nagar Colony road finally cleared of overflowing sewage||Hyderabad: Sewerage overflow at Vijay Nagar Colony in Tolichowki was resolved within days after the grievance was aired by a citizen reporter. The sewerage was overflowing on the main road for many days, causing immense inconvenience to the commuters. The stretch was full of drainage water thereby turning it into a breeding ground for mosquitoes. It was posing a risk for spread of dengue and other vector borne diseases in the neighbouring areas. “It is my daily route and I observed that on frequent occasions, the sewerage was overflowing on the road. I had complained to the civic authorities on multiple occasions through various mediums. However, it was resolved only after it was published in these columns,” said Mohammed Hussain, the citizen reporter. The heavy rains that the city has witnessed this monsoon has only added to the misery. Many such areas in Tolichowki have faced rampant sewage overflow. “It’s a matter of three to four days. Every time they clean the manholes, it overflows yet again. We need a permanent solution to such issues. The sewerage network needs to be improved drastically to avoid overflow, especially during monsoon,” said Parvez Mohiuddin, a Tolichowki resident. Meanwhile, the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation authorities along with local corporators inspected rain affected areas and instructed monsoon labourers to clean open drains, take up desilting and also clear garbage for free flow of drain and rain water in Tolichowki.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/vijay-nagar-colony-road-finally-cleared-of-overflowing-sewage/articleshow/86214695.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Readers’ Corner||I found my passion for books By Krithika Sai Mora When the lockdown had started most kids like me were happy about not going to school. But then, a few days later, we realised how boring it was staying at home the whole day without doing anything. At the start of lockdown there weren’t even any online classes going on, so we had to keep ourselves busy with something else. I started reading books and whenever I picked up a new book I realised I would get transported to another world with the characters in the story and imagined me being the main character. I finished a lot of books as I started reading a new one every day. I also started getting into the habit of maintaining my own diary, I wrote all my thoughts in it and even decorated it to keep myself busy. While I couldn’t see my friends, teachers and missed them all during the lockdown, I got a lot of time to spend with my family and do things with them that we would never get time to do earlier as everyone would be so busy with their work. We played games, did marathon movie sessions and other things. It made our bond stronger. So, while the lockdown had its problems it did us a lot of good too. People like me found a hobby and grew passionate about it. Now, of course many of us have started online classes while some are even going to physical schools, have exams are coming up etc. I see a lot of people roaming on the roads without a mask, which isn’t a good thing. I just hope all of us are careful and get our vaccines – even children by the end of the year, hopefully -- as we embrace this new normal. (The writer is a class 7 student of DPS, Nacharam) …......................... Learnt to appreciate my mom By Dikshita Chitlangi During the lockdown, after the initial shock, I was actually delighted and thankful for it as I was able to spend more time with my dad and get to know him more. The lockdown passed away with cooking, eating and doing some household chores. But when the restrictions were eased and my dad resumed work, that was when it struck me that staying locked up in the house and doing simple chores left me frustrated by the end whereas this has been the life of my mom and all the other housewives out there. All of us respect and love our moms but as they say, you will never understand someone unless you have a similar experience. In this new normal where people have returned to their routines, I'm trying my best to reduce my mom's load, at least a little bit. (The writer is a student at Badruka College of Commerce and Arts) …........................ Have given up on social gatherings By T Kailash Ditya After witnessing two waves of Covid-19 pass by – thankfully without getting infected myself – in this post Covid-19 era I always ensure that I wear a face mask, carry sanitiser in my pocket and keep myself away from large gatherings. Giving more time to myself and family rather than indulging in social gatherings and movies is also something that I have personally started to do. I have acclamatised myself to the concept of virtual meetings, online payments and spending more time on social media only to be in touch with near and dear ones. I have also taken up the habit of having more home-cooked food rather than food bought from hotels and added healthy options like millets, fruits and ginger masala chai(tea) to my diet. Spending more time on mental and physical fitness activities like meditation, yoga and walking has also become a priority for me. Of course, it is difficult to restrain myself from attending special occasions of people close to me at times, but I realise the gravity of the situation and understand that staying away is the only way to beat this virus. The Covid-19 wave has also made me realise how much freedom one used to enjoy before this virus entered India and how eagerly everyone is waiting for the good old days to come back so that we can all move freely without masks and sanitisers and celebrate weekends with friends and relatives.

---||Mumbai||‘Nirbhaya squads’ to fight sexual crimes in public places: Mumbai top cop||MUMBAI: Police commissioner Hemant Nagrale on Tuesday announced the formation of a 'Nirbhaya squad' at every police station to prevent instances of sexual harassment in public places, even as a team of cops from Sakinaka was felicitated for solving the brutal rape-murder case of a woman within 12 hours. The Nirbhaya squad will patrol crime hotspots, besides gathering intelligence from areas where women's hostels and shelters are located. Activists pointed out that the initiative needs to sustain in the long run and should not fizzle out. The Nirbhaya squad will comprise a woman officer and two constables-- at least one of them a woman-- besides a driver. The personnel will undergo training, which would include the use of recording equipment, such as pen cameras, to help collect evidence in stalking cases. Spots where crimes against women are frequently reported and isolated stretches would be identified and patrolling rounds scheduled as per crime patterns. The squad is required to keep tabs on movements of individuals who have been booked for sexual offences in the past five years. Women safety cells will be formed at each police station. TimesViewThe state and Mumbai police have been under immense pressure after the gruesome case came to light. Instead of starting new squads, the police force needs to be sensitised to be more humane in their approach to citizens, irrespective of their class or background. Usually, people hesitate to lodge a complaint as it could be a tedious process, especially when cops are unhelpful. The living and working conditions of the force would also have to improve to bring about a change in attitudes.The squad is to impart self-defence training in schools and colleges and install 'Nirbhaya boxes' for female students to submit complaints confidentially. Nagrale also wants Nirbhaya squads to prepare a list of elderly women living alone and visit them to redress their grievances. "The squad should maintain a separate register on action taken by them and a nodal officer will go through the register periodically. Regional additional commissioners will hold review meetings every month to iron out any issues," a circular issued by Nagrale said. In 2014, after the murder of techie Esther Anuhya, the Mumbai Police had launched a free SMS service for ensuring safety of women travelling alone at odd hours. Before taking an auto/ taxi, a woman could message the registration number of the vehicle to a dedicated helpline. Police had said they would keep track of the vehicle and would get the woman's location through GPS. As time passed, the initiative was scrapped. "Mumbai Police have limited manpower so forming new squads is going to add to the police station's burden. Another problem is the personnel's disinterest in lodging complaints, particularly where the complainant is poor or illiterate. Typically, complainants are cross questioned so many times that they'd rather leave than press charges," said RTI activist Anil Galgali. The police department has also tied up with an organisation, Mpower, to counsel victims of sexual assault and child sexual abuse as well as juvenile delinquents. (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/nirbhaya-squads-to-fight-sexual-crimes-in-public-places-top-cop/articleshow/86215227.cms||Nitasha Natu

Officiating chairman of NDDB Meenesh Shah presented Assam’s dairy development roadmap before Assam chief minister Dr Himanta Biswa Sarma on Monday in Guwahati. Atul Bora, minister for agriculture, horticulture, animal husbandry and veterinary was also present during the meeting. Sarma is keen to promote dairying as a livelihood in Assam. He wants to achieve a target of handling around 10 lakh litres of milk per day by end of the project period, said Shah. The CM emphasized that initiatives should be commercially viable and sufficiently remunerative for the dairy farmers of Assam. Shah said that the plan will include creating processing infrastructures, village level institutions and marketing of milk and milk products. “Simultaneously, productivity enhancement of milch animals will be achieved through increasing artificial insemination coverage, usage of sex-sorted semen, induction of high yielding animals, calf rearing programmes and interventions in feed and fodder,” he said. Assam government had earlier requested NDDB to manage the West Assam Cooperative Milk Union (WAMUL) which was on verge of closure. NDDB had taken over its management in 2008. Keeping in view the effect of NDDB’s intervention in restoring/reviving the dairy cooperative institution, the Assam government has approved another extension of NDDB’s management of WAMUL for a period of further five years. An agreement for the same was signed on August 6.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/assam-govt-and-nddb-to-form-spv/articleshow/86211638.cms||---

B B Dangde, CEO of Zilla Parishad, Thane, also tendered an unconditional apology on Tuesday and submitted an action plan. STEM Water Distribution and Infra Company Pvt Ltd which supplies water to the village has started supplying drinking water. Dangde, who also holds charge of managing director, STEM, told the court that a special drive will be undertaken to disconnect all existing 400-odd illegal water supply connections. Through advocate Ashish Gaikwad, Dangde also told the court that water charges to the tune of Rs 10 lakh were due from the village gram panchayat. The HC bench of Justices S J Kathawalla and Milind Jadhav asked the Kambe gram panchayat to take note of the efforts put in by advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni, and said it ought to undertake measures to clear pending water bills. Kumbhakoni said a committee has also been set up and had met to discuss various issues. The gram panchayat through its advocate R D Suryawanshi had said that the water supply by STEM was regular, but from October 2020 “taking undue advantage of the pandemic’’ had curtailed the water supply.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-after-hc-rap-kambe-village-gets-10-water-tankers-daily/articleshow/86216143.cms||---

Police initiated action on the basis of a complaint registered by a 71-year-old Bibvewadi resident. The group of senior citizens made the booking in December 2019 and the tour was to take place in March-April last year. The tour was cancelled in the wake of the nationwide lockdown announced by the central government due to the pandemic. When they demanded a refund, the operator told them that he had already paid the money for hotel bookings and to other agencies. Later, he locked his shop and ran way. Police said the operator took money towards hotel bookings, meals and flight tickets and local transport vehicles for movement in Kullu-Manali, and adjoining areas. Police said he had promised the group a refund on receipt of the money from airlines and hotels. However, he shut his shop and fled in March this year, police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/tour-operator-booked-on-charge-of-duping-7/articleshow/86212845.cms||---

Police arrested Dhananjay Nikam when was waiting to catch a train for his home town. The city police had got specific information on Nikam from their counterpart in Maharashtra. According to case details shared by Nikam with city police, he is a BSc graduate and living in Shahpur village in Jalgaon district. Currently unemployed, he was upset because he did not get OBC post-metric scholarship since past one and a half years. He also tried to make representation to Thackeray, but did not succeed.

---||Nagpur||After March, last 14 days have been longest spell of no Covid deaths in Vidarbha||NAGPUR: September 1 to 14 is probably the longest span when the region did not record a single Covid death since March 2020. The last fatalities were one each from Nagpur and Amravati, reported on August 31. Last month, there had been 21 deaths across the 11 districts. The month of July had recorded 74 deaths, when the sharp decline in Covid toll began. Barely five months back, the region had seen nearly 250-300 deaths in a day during the second wave peak. The month of April this year recorded the highest number of 5,670 Covid deaths, since the pandemic started. A single death had been reported in March 2020 and after that the numbers have always remained in double digits. The five months from May to September had seen 6,870 Covid deaths, with drastic drop starting from June onwards, when fatalities came down to 527 in the entire month. So far in this September, the cases have remained low at over 400, which is almost 10 times lower than the August tally. Another peculiar feature of the Covid graph now commonly seen is zero cases in more than two districts at regular intervals. In fact, the rural parts of Nagpur did not report a single case for over 12 days at a stretch in August-end. Bhandara, which currently has only two active cases, became the first district to become Covid free for several days. This month too, it has seen only three cases. The region has recorded an average of 29 cases this month. The spike in cases in one or two districts such as Nagpur or Buldhana takes the day’s tally to more than 10. As cases have gone down, the testing figures too have declined. However, more than 100 tests are performed even in districts not reporting any cases. Infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde said, “The incidence of disease has dropped due to herd immunity. The next wave will be driven by either unvaccinated people or by a new variant. A variant which is stronger than delta seems less likely right now.” Asked how long the region can maintain the current situation, Dr Shinde said generally the next wave starts 5 to 6 months after the previous one. “We are reaching that point now. We will require new variants and super spreaders events and more unvaxxed people. This will make environment conducive for the virus,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/after-march-last-14-days-have-been-longest-spell-of-no-covid-deaths-in-vid/articleshow/86212857.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||India||Post-mortem report can’t be sole basis for conviction: SC||NEW DELHI: Holding that a person cannot be convicted merely on the basis of post-mortem report, the Supreme Court on Tuesday acquitted a man who was sentenced to life imprisonment for unnatural death of his wife and quashed trial court and Patna high court order convicting him on the basis of medical report which said that she died of throttling. A bench of Justices Ajay Rastogi and Abhay S Oka said the guilt of the accused has not been established beyond a reasonable doubt and the circumstances established by the prosecution do not lead to only one possible inference regarding the guilt of the accused. The court also noted that there was no eyewitnesses in the case and the relationship between the husband and wife was not strained to indicate any foul play on his behalf. In this case, the husband contended that she died of burn injuries as she caught fire while cooking and family members tried their best to douse the fire. The prosecution, however, rubbished his claim as the autopsy report said the death was due to asphyxia. Going by the findings of a post-mortem report, the trial court and the HC convicted him and awarded life imprisonment. Examining statements of all witnesses and evidence, the apex court said the guilt of the accused was not proved beyond doubt and acquitted him. "In this case, neither the prosecution witnesses have deposed to that effect nor any other material has been placed on record to show that the relationship between the appellant and the deceased was strained in any manner. Moreover, the appellant was not the only person residing in the house where the incident took place and it is brought on record that the parents of the appellant were also present on the date of the incident in the house. The fact that other members of the family of the appellant were present shows that there could be another hypothesis which cannot be altogether excluded. Therefore, it can be said that the facts established do not rule out the existence of any other hypothesis," said Justice Oka who penned the verdict. "Therefore, what survives for consideration is only an opinion of the medical practitioner who conducted the autopsy and gave a report on the cause of death. As held in the case of Balaji Gunthu Dhule, only on the basis of post-mortem report, the appellant could not have been convicted of the offence punishable under Section 302 of IPC and consequently for the offence punishable under Section 201 of IPC," it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/post-mortem-report-cant-be-sole-basis-for-conviction-sc/articleshow/86217713.cms||---

---||Amritsar||Man arrested for violation of Takht Sri Kesgarh Sahib sanctity linked to Sirsa dera: Jathedar||Patiala: The Akal Takht officiating jathedar on Tuesday alleged a direct link between the Ludhiana resident arrested on Monday for allegedly smoking at Takht Sri Kesgarh Sahib and controversial Sirsa-based Dera Sacha Sauda. However, police refused to corroborate it, saying the matter was under investigation. Jathedar Giani Harpeet Singh claimed that accused Paramjeet Singh was a follower of Dera Sacha Sauda and son of a member of its central committee. He alleged that the accused’s in-laws were also dera followers and that he had tied the knot as per the sect’s rituals. He demanded legal action against the dera head, its committee and Paramjeet’s wife their alleged involvement in the crime to hurt the sentiments of the Sikh community. The jathedar accused the dera of instigating its followers to conspire sacrilege of Sri Guru Granth Sahib. Ropar SSP Vivek Sheel Soni refused to comment on the allegations, saying the matter was under investigation. “We would not be able to comment on the issue until the investigation in the matter is completed,” he said. Takht Kesgarh Sahib manager Malkit Singh said they have set up a five member co-ordination committee to help the police in investigation of this case. Paramjeet had allegedly smoked inside the premises of Takht Sri Kesgarh Sahib, to which the staff and devotees had objected. He was nabbed by the gurdwara security guards and handed over to the police. A case has been lodged against the accused on the complaint of a sewadar. The Sikh Rehat Maryada (Sikh code of conduct) strictly prohibits smoking. Meanwhile, there was complete bandh in Anandpur Sahib city following a call by given by the Beopar mandal. All shops remained closed after 11am in protest against the unfortunate incident of smoking at Takht Sri Kesgarh Sahib. Anandpur Sahib Beopar Mandal president Inderjit Singh Arora said, “We gave a bandh call and all shops were closed after 11am as a mark of protest against the sacrilege at Sri Kesgarh Sahib. Only some dhabas, restuarants and medical shops were open.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/man-arrested-for-violation-of-takht-sri-kesgarh-sahib-sanctity-linked-to-sirsa-dera-jathedar/articleshow/86212909.cms||Bharat Khanna
---||Nagpur||Over 50% Vidarbha population jabbed in 9 months||NAGPUR: Nagpur and Amravati circles have collectively inoculated 1.27 crore people with at least one dose across the 11 districts in Vidarbha. This comes to around 51% of the total population. The region’s total population is estimated to be around 2.5 crore while 70% of it is the target for Covid vaccination. This means another 25 lakh remains to be covered even after nine months from the start of the vaccination programme. On Tuesday, the 11 districts achieved a record over 95,000 vaccination. Considering this as average per day jabs, it will approximately need the region anther 30 days to cover the remaining 25 lakh beneficiaries (approx). Also, if the supply of doses remains unaffected, the total eligible population is likely to be vaccinated in next three months The Nagpur division with 76.97 lakh jabs has contributed 60% in the total vaccination achievement of the region. Amravati’s five districts have jabbed 50.87 lakh which is 39% of the region’s achievement. Out of the 1.25 crore vaccinations, 73% are first dose at 94.51 lakh. The second dose coverage is abysmal — 33.33 lakh which is just 26%. Nagpur district with over 33 lakh vaccination is leading the chart. Amravati district with 12.89 lakh jabs is second and closely followed by Chandrapur at 12.58 lakh. Gadchiroli has the lowest number of vaccination at 4.89lakh. The major achievement of the drive came since June onwards when government allowed vaccination of 18-45 years group. With each district having enough stock and private hospitals’ doses lying idle, the only factor delaying drive now is longer gap between both doses of Covishield, which is given at over 90% centres. Vaccination centres are daily flooded with queries from anxious beneficiaries regarding their second dose. When asked about the huge difference between first and second doses, Vidarbha Hospital Association convenor Dr Anup Marar said, “The percentage gap can be because of the revised prolonged duration between 1st and 2nd dose which affected all 18 plus majority. Those who sincerely got vaccinated are eagerly waiting for their second dose. It is high time government strictly pursues those who have not yet got vaccinated.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/over-50-vid-population-jabbed-in-9-months-second-dose-getting-delayed/articleshow/86212917.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

---||Pune||Most Covid patients in ICUs not vaccinated: Pune hospitals||PUNE: Going by the trend of Covid-19 patients admitted to intensive care units of hospitals in the city, fully vaccinated people are less susceptible to coronavirus-induced serious illness. A majority of patients currently being treated in the hospitals’ intensive care units (ICUs) were unvaccinated and a big chunk of them was in the age group of below 45 years, stated treating doctors. The ICU admission trend coincided with the lowest vaccination numbers in the below-45 age bracket and underlined the importance to hasten Covid immunization in this young, productive, and highly mobile category, experts stressed. Noble Hospital’s infectious diseases expert Ameet Dravid said, “From August, we have treated 52 Covid patients in our hospital’s ICU. Of them, 31 patients (approximately 60%) were unvaccinated against Covid-19.” Among the rest of the 21 Covid patients in the hospital’s ICU, a total of 10 had taken a single dose of Covid vaccine and 11 had taken both doses, Dravid said. Twenty-one of the 52 ICU patients (40%) were below 45 years of age. Of the remaining 31 ICU patients, as many as 18 were above 60 years and 13 were in the 46-60 years age bracket. “Our analysis of the hospital-based data revealed that the current ICU admission trend of Covid patients was driven by those who have not yet opted for vaccination. We shall continue to see the impact of Covid among the unvaccinated and it is primarily among them that we see the majority of severe illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths,” Dravid said. “The vaccine is really protective in terms of avoiding hospitalization or death, and a majority of people we are seeing that are sick and ending up hospitalized and on ventilators, are unvaccinated patients,” he added. Noble Hospital in Hadapsar is the first point of referral for hospitals in rural parts of Pune and adjoining districts like Ahmednagar and Solapur because of its easy-to-approach location. “That’s also the reason why we have more patients in Covid ICU than most other hospitals in the heart of the city,” Dravid said. At Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital, a total of 12 Covid patients are undergoing treatment in ICU. Of them, six are unvaccinated. “All those unvaccinated are below 45 years,” said the hospital’s chief intensivist Prasad Rajhans. Rekha Dubey, the chief executive officer (CEO) of Aditya Birla Memorial Hospital in Chinchwad, said, “It is very sad to see young and unvaccinated adults seeking care for Covid when a potent protection against Covid-19 is available and is given free at many centres.” Only six of the 32 Covid patients admitted at Sahyadri Hospital’s ICU in the last few days were vaccinated. “Of them, two were fully vaccinated and four had taken a single shot. The rest 26 were unvaccinated,” said the hospital’s chief operating officer, Abrarali Dalal. Physician Aniket Joshi, an ICU consultant at 10 different private hospitals in the core city areas, said, “Currently, we are getting sporadic Covid patients who need ICU care. It is true that a sizable number of mild or moderately ill Covid patients we see are unvaccinated. Overall, Covid cases from the city areas are very few.” Joshi is visiting ICU consultant at Poona Hospital, Pune Cantonment Board-run Sardar Vallabbhai Patel General Hospital, Tarachand Hospital, ONP Meera Hospital and Alliance Hospital, among others. Loni-Kalbhor based Visharaj Hospital’s chief intensivist Kapil Borawake said, “It is my observation that those who need hospitalisation are most often unvaccinated or partially vaccinated or have got the first shot recently and this has not allowed enough time for the body to mount the adequate immune response against the contagion.” Pune Municipal Corporation’s nodal officer for Covid, Sanjeev Wavare, said, “We shall take up the analysis of the data of Covid patients on oxygen therapy and in ICU in terms of their vaccination status. The overall observation is that more unvaccinated people are seeking care than those vaccinated.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/most-covid-patients-in-icus-not-vaxxed-city-hospitals/articleshow/86212926.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The suspects agreed on Rs5 lakh following negotiations. But, the councillor on Monday approached the police and filed a complaint. Jagdale said based on the CCTV footage recovered from the complainant’s office and recordings by him in his cellphone, the police arrested the trio on Tuesday. “We will soon arrest the remaining suspects,” Jagdale said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/3-arrested-for-bid-to-extort-rs-15-lakh/articleshow/86212902.cms||---
---||Lucknow||33,000 children born with heart disease in UP every year||LUCKNOW: While playing in his courtyard one day, 11-month-old Roshan turned unconscious and his body started to turn blue. Panicked, his family rushed him to a doctor who suspected he had a congenital heart disease. The baby was referred to Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGIMS) where cardiac surgeons diagnosed him with tricuspid atresia, commonly known as blue baby syndrome. A seven-hour surgery saved the boy. However, not all babies in India are as lucky as Roshan. Data shows that nearly 2 lakh children are born with CHD in India each year. Described as a structural abnormality of the heart, CHD is a leading cause of child mortality across the world. “About one-fifth affected children are likely to have serious defect, requiring an intervention in the first year of life. But advanced cardiac care is available to only a minority,” notes the article ‘Congenital Heart Disease in India’ published in medical journal Indian Paediatrics. The Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram (RBSK), in which children from birth to 18 years are screened to identify defects, deficiencies, diseases and development delays, has come to the rescue of such children. More than 700 children with CHD have been operated upon and given a new life through the programme in UP since 2017. “The numbers would have been better had Covid-19 not hampered programmes. For the first time, the system is reaching out to the population to screen children,” said Dr Ved Prakash, general manager of RBSK, National Health Mission, UP. According to estimates, CHD burdens about 33,000 babies in UP each year. Of these, one-fifth or 6,500 need cardiac surgery. “There is gross ignorance about CHDs among public. A majority of children arrive late and are diagnosed in their 20s. Awareness is the first step,” said Dr Sanjay Niranjan, senior member of Indian Paediatric Association. According to cardiac surgeon Dr Vijayant Devenraj, a number of cardiac centres have come up over the past decade but most are in the private sector and geographically not very well-distributed. The system going into the public through RBSK is a great idea. “However, investing hefty sums in old government hospitals will not bring about desired returns. Collaboration of public and private stakeholders can save many more lives at a lower cost,” he said. To explain, he added, “There are surgeons and private hospitals willing to work and corporate social responsibility funds can be put to logical use. The government can come up with a model which bridges the gap to save more children. This can also support those with complex cardiac conditions who land at big hospitals but have no money to bear the cost.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/33k-kids-born-with-heart-disease-in-up-every-year/articleshow/86215250.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Kerala: Following churn in Congress, yet another top leader joins CPM||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: In another setback to the Congress party, KPCC former general secretary K P Anil Kumar on Tuesday quit the party and joined the CPM. Former KPCC secretary P S Prashanth, who also faced disciplinary action for criticising the DCC presidents' appointment, had joined the CPM in a similar fashion a few days ago. Tuesday's developments were dramatic as the dissident leader joined the CPM within four hours of announcing his resignation from the Congress at 8.10am. He was expelled from the Congress by 11.30 am and he joined the CPM at 12.10pm. The CPM had organised a reception to him at the AKG Centre, with three politburo members Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, S Ramachandran Pillai and M A Baby receiving him. The state Congress leadership was firm about its action. "The party decided to expel him as the explanation given by him was not satisfactory. Anil Kumar is someone who occupied key posts in the party. The kind of statements he made are unacceptable," KPCC president K Sudhakaran said. Opposition leader V D Satheesan also said discipline is paramount in the party. Ahead of joining the CPM, Anil Kumar lashed out at the state Congress leadership at a news conference. Alleging that the state leadership was behaving in an authoritarian manner, he asked why there was no disciplinary action against senior leaders Oommen Chandy and Ramesh Chennithala who also raised similar charges against the state leadership. He said he could lead the state Youth Congress without succumbing to factional pressures for five years from 2002 to 2007, and he and his colleagues had an important role in keeping youths within the party fold when veteran leader K Karunakaran left it to form his own party. "When I was denied opportunities in the party, I never went to hold talks with the BJP or Sangh Parivar. Sudhakaran has admitted that he was ready to talk with Sangh Parivar if he was denied the KPCC president's post. Only a person with a Sangh Parivar mindset can think of joining them. When such a person is heading the party in Kerala, how will there be democracy and secularism in the Congress," he asked. He also blamed AICC general secretary K C Venugopal for the present crisis in the party. “Venugopal has a huge role in the latest developments. He wants everything to be under his control,” he said. Anil Kumar said he had to pay a price for ignoring group equations as he was kept away from organisational positions for long. He had worked for the Congress for four decades and he was made a KPCC general secretary when Ramesh Chennithala became president. He had served as KPCC general secretary under V M Sudheeran, M M Hassan and Mullappally Ramachandran. He said he was denied a seat to contest in 2016 and 2021 assembly elections. He wanted to contest from Koyilandi seat in Kozhikode but was asked to contest from Vattiyoorkavu in Thiruvananthapuram. Later, he was not allotted the seat following local protests. It was all orchestrated, he said. Anil Kumar was accompanied by Prashanth to the AKG Centre. "The Congress is disintegrating and Anil Kumar was a key leader of the party responsible for organisational affairs," Kodiyeri said while admitting him to the party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/following-churn-in-cong-yet-another-top-leader-joins-cpm/articleshow/86212942.cms||---

But does the colour of the tail change over the years? A zoologist or a veterinary doctor can give the best answer to it, but recently the colour of a cow’s tail became a legal dispute in Vadodara. A dairy farmer from Padra, who owns one buffalo and three cows, dragged an insurance company to court as the latter denied her claim for a dead cow. The farmer Dipika Patel’s cow died on July 12 last year due to natural causes. When Patel filed a claim of Rs 50,000 with United Insurance Company Pvt Ltd, the company, in a bizarre reply, told Patel that as per their record the cow’s tail’s colour is white while in the photo of the carcass it looks black. Patel filed a complaint against the insurer at Vadodara District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum to get the claim amount of Rs 50,000. During the court proceedings, the insurance company’s lawyer argued that the claim was turned down as per the terms and conditions of the policy because the dead cow did not match with the insured cow. In response to the insurance company’s arguments, Patel’s lawyer submitted that the postmortem report also mentions that it is the same cow and not a different one. It was also argued that for identifying an animal its colour, shape of its horn among other characteristics are considered, but its real identification can be done by its tag. The court upheld the argument that the cow’s real identity is its tag. Patel’s insured cow’s tag number was 1626 and the dead cow’s tag number is also the same. The court also closely observed the photo of the carcass and noted that the tail is little bent and due to bad light in the photograph it may look black. “Insurance companies are statutory bodies and its responsibility is to not reject insured person’s claims by citing irrelevant technical issues. Thus, by rejecting the claim, the insurance company has been deficient in its services,” the court stated. It asked the insurance company to pay Rs 50,000 to Patel along with 9% interest and pay a compensation of Rs 10,000 for mental harassment and litigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/insurance-co-fails-to-make-head-or-tail-of-cows-colour-loses-case/articleshow/86210768.cms||Jay Pachchigar

The employee of the company riding a pillion got stuck near the wheel of the crane and collided with the divider and was dragged for a few metres following which he died, while his companion sustained grievous wounds. Puneet Pal (34), a resident of Karrahi Road, was a manager in a private pharma company in the city. On Tuesday afternoon, he was going from Bidhnoo to Naubasta along with his friend Satwik. A speeding crane hit the bike from behind on Hamirpur Road near Naubasta Bamba. As a result, Satvik was injured by falling on the left side, while Puneet got stuck in an iron angle near the wheel of the crane.

---||Pune||Unused tocilizumab stock from Satara diverted to Pune||PUNE: The administration has started diverting unused stock of tocilizumab — an anti-rheumatic drug administered to severely ill Covid-19 patients — from Satara to Pune to address its acute shortage in the district. “Currently, we have diverted 100 vials of tocilizumab, each containing 40mg drug, from Satara district through the divisional commissioner’s intervention. We are tapping the unused stock of the medicine in other neighbouring districts as well,” said Shyam Pratapwar, assistant commissioner (drugs), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Pune. The treating Covid hospitals have been facing the drug crunch for a week now. Quite a few severely ill patients are getting referred to hospitals in Pune from rural areas and adjoining districts. Some of these patients have cytokine storm — an abnormal immune response — and need tocilizumab to tide it over. Unlike remdesivir, tocilizumab is distributed to treating hospitals only against requirement through the district collectorate because it is an imported drug and its supply has always been erratic. “We are doing our best to replenish the stock in Pune,” Pratapwar said. Noble Hospital’s infectious diseases expert Ameet Dravid said, “We have used tocilizumab in 39 Covid patients in our ICU in the last one month. The treatment outcome is the best in carefully selected patients.” Doctors are using other drugs in view of the shortage of tocilizumab, including anti-cancer, anti-ulcerative colitis and immunosuppressant drugs, but studies have not proven them very useful in tackling Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/unused-tocilizumab-stock-from-satara-diverted-to-pune/articleshow/86213016.cms||Umesh Isalkar

The petrol pump is only a few hundred metres from Sonegaon police station. Police said two security guards had shut down the pump and kept the cash inside the office after the working hours. The three robbers came in a four-wheeler, which they parked near a hotel on Wardha Road. They walked into the petrol pump and called the security personnel. As soon as the security personnel came out of the office, the goons assaulted them and threatened with knives. Two of them then barged into the office while one stood outside to keep a watch. The goons lay their hands on Rs2.30 lakh cash and decamped in the car towards Narendra Nagar. Sources stated that the petrol pump had been targeted by robbers in the past too.

This would include the high- and low-risk contacts,” said an official of the district health department. Additional chief secretary, health, Dr Pradeep Vyas on Monday told all the collectors to ramp up testing. The district’s daily testing dipped to 18,000 this against 25,000-30,000 the previous week. “There has been a consistent decline in tests not just in the state but in the district, too. Pune collector Rajesh Deshmukh directed all the health officials in a meeting to ensure that enough testing was done in the rural areas, with a lot of floating population because of the festivities. We want to ensure that anyone having any Covid symptoms are immediately tested and isolated,” said the health official. With five days remaining for visarjan (immersion), intensive tests are being conducted at various places in the state. Last week, the rural areas in Pune registered 4.6% weekly positivity (WPR) against less than 4% in the city areas. The district health officials told all 104 laboratories in Pune to complete their data entry before the weekly Covid-19 review meeting to be chaired by the deputy chief minister, Ajit Pawar, either on Friday or Saturday. The delay in data entry of negative reports from the laboratories affected the overall WPR of the district in the note given to the state cabinet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/conduct-2-5k-tests-per-day-before-immersion-dist-admin-to-talukas/articleshow/86212970.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Delhi||Delhi Police inflated amount in cheating case: Court||NEW DELHI: A city court has come down heavily on Delhi Police, saying it appeared that the money allegedly laundered in a cheating case was “intentionally inflated” by the investigating agency with a “malicious intent to hoodwink the court”. The case is related to an alleged cheating case in which the Special Cell of Delhi Police claimed the accused had laundered money to the tune of Rs 1.7 crore. During the hearing of bail application of one of the accused, his counsel pointed out that according to the complainant, the cheated amount was a mere Rs 30,000. In order to determine the quantum of the cheated amount and the status of the victims, the court had requested the assistance commissioner of police concerned to look into the matter and apprise it about the actual facts. The ACP and the investigating officer (IO) appeared before the court and proffered the statements of six witnesses. Additional sessions judge Dharmender Rana said that even the ACP and IO had conceded that none of the witnesses accused the suspects of any cheating. “The perusal of the record would reveal that it was specifically reported to this court that in the case at hand, Rs1,74,27,194 was the money laundered out of India illegally. It appears that the investigating agency is not at all sincere in its intent to trace the victims or the alleged money laundered has been intentionally inflated by the investigating agency with the malicious intent to hoodwink the court. In either case, it is a serious issue,” the judge said in the order. The court also said that it was pained to observe that for the past six months, even the sole complainant has not been asked to join the probe by the IO. “The ACP concerned and the IO have not apprised this court of any palpable reason why they have opted not to even ask the complainant to join the investigation. Considering the totality of circumstances, more particularly, the rights of unheard victims, I deem it appropriate that DCP concerned may personally look into the matter,” the judge said. The court directed the DCP to apprise it by way of an affidavit on the steps taken to trace the victims of the cheating in the matter by linking the bank transactions of the alleged account. It added that it was conscious of the rights of the accused for expeditious disposal of the instant application, but the court was equally conscious of the rights of the victims. The judge said, “To arrive at a just conclusion, I deem it appropriate that unheard and invisible victims in the case at hand are at least in a position to put forth their version in the court.” He adjourned the matter for further arguments on September 15.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/police-inflated-amount-in-cheating-case-court/articleshow/86213256.cms||Usha Das
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Ex-corporator, kin torture minor for talking to 13-year-old||NAGPUR: A politically well connected couple allegedly locked up a 17-year-old boy before thrashing him for being friendly with their 13-year-old daughter in Wadi area on September 10. The scared minor and his family managed to muster courage to approach police after two days to register a complaint. Sources said former woman corporator, belonging to a national political party, and her family members were miffed at the boy, residing in the same locality, after they came across chat messages and call details on the girl’s cellphone. The messages and call logs indicated frequent communication between the 13-year-old and the boy, which infuriated the girl’s parents and elder sister. In a bid to teach a lesson to the boy, the girl’s elder sister contacted the boy when he had gone to a grocer’s shop last Fridiay and asked him to come to their place. As the unsuspecting boy stepped inside the house, he was allegedly assaulted by the ex-corporator, her husband and elder daughter. As per the complaint, the boy was also hit by utensils when he ran towards the kitchen to save himself. The boy was repeatedly threatened by the trio after thrashing him mercilessly. It’s learnt that the former corporator also threatened to frame the boy in some case so as to keep him away from her daughter. The boy somehow managed to flee the place and reached his house in an injured condition. Though the boy narrated the incident to his mother, the aggrieved family was scared to go against the politically well connected family. Senior inspector Pradeep Suryawanshi of Wadi police station said an offence of threatening, assault and hurling abuses has been registered against the ex-corporator and her family members. “We are investigating the case,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ex-corporator-kin-torture-minor-for-talking-to-13-yr-old/articleshow/86213046.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Nagpur||Coal on way out as renewable energy costs hit record lows in India||Nagpur: South Asia has a pre-construction pipeline of 37.4 gigawatt (GW) of new coal projects, with India’s 21GW pipeline accounting for 56% of this. New coal does not make economic sense for India anymore, as renewable energy can deliver these outcomes better, quicker and cheaper, and without the negative socio-economic, health, and environmental impacts of coal, reveals a new report assessing the global pipeline of new coal projects. The report ‘No New Coal By 2021: The Collapse of the Global Pipeline’, released by independent climate change think tank E3G, analyses that there has been a 76% reduction in proposed coal power since the Paris Agreement was signed in 2015. It further highlights that though India is moving slowly away from coal at a national level, considerable progress is being made at the state level. The climate groups behind the report are E3G, Global Energy Monitor and Ember. “India’s pre-construction pipeline of 21GW is the second largest in the world. The country is currently constructing 34GW of new coal capacity, more than the next seven countries combined. This is on top of India’s considerable existing operating fleet of 233GW (11.3% of the global total),” the report states. It further highlights that since 2015, the country has seen over 326GW of projects getting cancelled, including more than 250GW of shelved capacity. “Conditions are now ripe for India’s remaining pipeline to not continue into construction,” it added. Between 2019 and 2021, public officials from four Indian states — Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka — announced their intention to “not build new coal power plants”. According to a 2019 study, many more states have the potential to move away from new coal power due to a combination of socio-economic and environmental factors, particularly the rapidly increasing cost competitiveness of new renewables. Stating that the cost implications of building new coal plants are starker in India than in many other countries, the analysis finds that average coal plant load factors have fallen consistently — from 61% in 2018 to 53% in 2021, making it more expensive to run existing plants and highlighting the folly of building new coal. “Meanwhile, renewable tariffs in India are some of the lowest in the world, reaching a record low of Rs1.99 kilowatt hour (kWh) in December 2020. This is cheaper than the majority of the existing Indian coal fleet, and all the new coal projects. Renewables backed by storage are also increasingly competitive,” the report adds. Researchers also revealed that there has been a 76% reduction in proposed coal power since the Paris Agreement was signed in 2015, bringing the end of new coal construction into sight. “The collapse of the global coal pipeline and the rise of commitments to ‘no new coal’ are progressing hand in hand. The economics of coal have become increasingly uncompetitive in comparison to renewable energy, while the risk of stranded assets has increased. Governments can now act with confidence to commit to ‘no new coal’,” said author of the report Chris Littlecott. Pointing out that multiple countries can add their voices to a snowball of public commitments to “no new coal”, Dave Jones, Global Programme Lead at Ember, said, “We urge governments to publicly state their intentions that no new coal plants will be built in their country. Only five years ago, there were so many new coal power plants planned to be built, but most of these have been now either officially halted, or are paused and unlikely ever to be built.” Ember is an independent climate and energy think tank focused on accelerating the global electricity transition from coal to clean energy.

Champalal Prajapat was a native of Sujangarh in Rajasthan and was an expert in superconductors. His close friends suspect foul play but police ruled it out. Trombay police registered an accidental death report. A close friend of Prajapat said Ganesh Chaturthi was a holiday, but he was called to work as he was the secretary to the upcoming symposium involving his technical physics division. At 5.08pm he called his wife and said he would be home by 5.30pm . He did not return, so a friend was requested to look for him. At 7pm he was found in the helium plant hanging. His body was blue. There was no suicide note found after the incident and the hanging too “was not proper”, added the friend. Senior inspector Siddheshwar Gove said, “The post-mortem report showed that he died by hanging. We recorded the statement of his wife and a witness, and found that he was depressed. We have learnt that he was under stress and was undergoing treatment at BARC hospital itself,’’ said Gove. In January, scientist Anuj Tripathi (37), working in the bio-chem department of BARC, died by suicide after a tiff with his wife.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-scientist-found-hanging-at-barc-plant-in-mankhurd/articleshow/86215409.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Won’t tolerate film actors in Ramlila: Ayodhya seers' group||AYODHYA: The seers of Ayodhya, including Mahant Dharam Das of Hanuman Garhi temple, have demanded that Bollywood actors should not be allowed to perform in Ramlilas as they do not have “moral and religious discipline”. Seers said the artistes who perform in Ramlilas follow strict discipline in their lives and people bow before them to seek blessings. Nearly a hundred prominent seers from Ayodhya met at Bada Bhakt Maal temple, an important seat of Hindu religious studies in Ayodhya, and decided to seek an appointment from CM Yogi Adityanath to get the “immoral Ramlila banned”. “There is a special tradition of Ramlila in Ayodhya. Artistes who play the roles of Lord Ram, Mata Sita and other characters in traditional Ramlila, are respected by people. We bow before them. We cannot seek blessings from Bollywood actors who don’t follow religious discipline,” said Mahant Dharam Das, the priest of Hanuman Garhi temple. Mahant Awadhesh Das Shastri, chief priest of Bada Bhakt Maal temple, said: “We cannot tolerate such people performing in Ayodhya’s Ramlila. They consume alcohol, eat non-vegetarian food and indulge in immoral practices.” “Last year, when Bollywood actors staged Ramlila, they wore ‘Mughaliya sherwani’ and leather shoes on the stage. How can one perform in such an indecent costume,” said Mahant Pawan Kumar Das Shastri, secretary of Hindu Personal Law Board. “We want Ramlila to have essence of ‘sanaatan dharm’. We do not want film personalities who have destroyed the Hindu religion,” said Mahant Janmejay Sharan, chief priest of Bada Sthan temple. Meanwhile, the Ayodhya Ramlila Committee performed bhumi pujan on the Saryu banks on Tuesday formally announcing that the star-studded Ramlila would be held in the presence of UP law minister Brajesh Pathak.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/wont-tolerate-film-actors-in-ramlila-ayodhya-seers-grp/articleshow/86215363.cms||Arshad Afzaal Khan

---||Aurangabad||AIMIM plans ‘Thank You’ campaign to greet CM||Aurangabad: In a unique protest aimed at highlighting different civic issues that have been plaguing Aurangabad city, the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) has announced a special “Thank You” campaign to greet chief minister Uddhav Thackeray upon his arrival to attend the Marathwada Liberation Day celebrations on September 17. The proposed demonstration, which is planned amid complaints of erratic and once-a-week water supply in Aurangabad and poor roads in many areas, will involve forming a human chain from the Aurangabad airport all the way up to the government guest house on a route of the CM’s convoy and showering of petals on him amid sounds of the tutari. Stating that the city police have denied them permission to hold any public protest due to the Covid-related curbs, local AIMIM MP Imtiaz Jaleel, on sarcastic note, said that the “Thank You” campaign aims to express gratitude to the CM for “addressing” the basic civic issues of Aurangabad and putting the city on the path of “development”. “Shiv Sena boasts of producing 14 efficient mayors in the history of Aurangabad, with claims of carrying out a slew of developmental works for the benefit of the city. While the police have barred us from holding a protest, they cannot prevent us from expressing our thanks to the Sena chief and the CM during his visit,” Jaleel told reporters on Tuesday. Taking a further swipe at the CM, he said the people of Aurangabad also want to thank Thackeray as he did not allow a sports university to come up in Aurangabad. “Instead of the sports university, the CM has offered us the Sant Vidyapeeth at Paithan. He does not want the youth to play sports, but to become saints. For that, he deserves a special thank you,” the MP said. While Jaleel, on past occasions, had skipped the Marathwada Liberation Day celebrations, prompting his political rivals to recall the purported history of an allegiance of AIMIM founders with the Nizam rule, the city MP said he would be in town this year and would celebrate the occasion in his own style. “The CM and ruling party leaders visit Aurangabad every year on September 17 and make hollow claims of progress and their love for Marathwada. Last year, on the occasion of the Marathwada Liberation Day, I met the chief of Railway Board to pursue the demand for constructing an RoB at Shivajinagar,” he said. Former Sena MP Chandrakant Khaire and immediate former mayor of Aurangabad Nandkumar Ghodele could not be reached for their comments despite repeated attempts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/aimim-plans-thank-you-campaign-to-greet-cm/articleshow/86208403.cms||Prasad Joshi

The youth of Uttar Pradesh has come to know that real nationalism means good education, good health system, employment opportunities and safe society where there is no fear of criminals.” He added, “The life of Lord Ram gives the message of brotherhood. Forgetting the distinctions of caste and creed, he teaches to embrace everyone.” Sisodia and Singh had reached Ayodhya on Monday, a day ahead of the yatra. They had offered prayers at the Ram Janmabhoomi temple and Hanuman Garhi temple and met saints and seers.

---||Jaipur||In 4 Rajasthan districts, more women vaccinated for Covid than men||JAIPUR: In four districts of the state, more women have vaccinated against Covid-19 compared to men, according to data released by the health department. This include Jhunjhunu from where Prime Minister Narendra Modi had launched the national-level ‘Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao’ campaign in 2018. Dungarpur, Nagaur and Rajsamand are the three other districts where women have taken the initiative to get inoculated. While 47,745 more women received jabs in Dungrapur than men, reporting the highest gender difference in vaccinations among these four, Jhunjhunu came second. Jhunjhunu came second with 36,233 more doses, followed by Nagaur 19,162 and Rajsamand 13,837 more doses, respectively. Dungarpur’s chief medical health officer (CMHO) Dr Rajesh Sharma said, “We have conducted aggressive awareness campaign in cooperation with district the administration in our district and encouraged women take the jab. This has proved fruitful for us. We used pictures of influential women for the campaign. Also, we roped in female staff who went going door-to-door and persuaded women to get vaccinated.” Jhunjhunu, the district in Shekhawati region which flagged off the campaign for gender equality in 2018, vaccinated 9,28,403 women compared to 8,92,170 men. The district had reported the lowest child sex ratio (CSR) at 837 as per Census 2011 in the state. It has, since then, made significant progress in the category. The sex ratio between April 2015 and March 2016 was 903 in the district, which increased to 944 between in 2016-17, and 979 in 2020-21.The district is witnessing serpentine queues of women in urban and rural areas as well. “In Jhunjhunu, women are more aware as they are literate. Jhunjhunu is one of the district which has the highest female literacy rates in the state as per Census 2011. Also, it seems that the event organised in Jhunjhunu for pan-India expansion of ‘Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao’ has also made a positive impact among women,” said Rajan Chaudhary, a social activists based in Jhunjhunu, who has played a big role in saving the girl child by helping the state government in conducting decoy operations to nab those involved in female foeticide and conducting sex determination tests. Health department officials have also focused on improving the participation of women. “As per the trend here, more women got vaccinated than men in the district. We have encouraged them by reaching out to those living in remote areas. We have taken the help of panchayati raj institutions and public representatives in rural areas to create awareness among women. We strategically planned our vaccination sites to ensure that women got the vaccine doses near their houses,” said Dr Dayanand Singh, reproduction and child health officer (RCHO), Jhunjhunu. “Women in Jhunjhunu are more aware about vaccination as they are literate and work in different sectors. There are women serving in the Army, medical, education and other sectors. This has also made a positive impact on women’s vaccination in the district,” Dr Singh said.

---||Nashik||Nashik: Police constable kidnaps minor girl, held||Nashik: A 38-year-old constable was arrested by the police on Monday on the charge of allegedly kidnapping a minor girl. The constable was known to the girl’s family and he allegedly convinced the girl to travel with him from one place to another in his car on Sunday afternoon. The girl’s parents eventually registered a complaint and the constable was traced with the girl on Monday afternoon. Bharatkumar Suryawanshi, the senior inspector of the Mhasrool police station, said the complainant is also acquainted with the accused constable’s family for a long time. According to Suryawanshi, on the constable’s insistence, the girl left with him in his car on Sunday afternoon. Later, he took the girl from one place to another in the city. He had, however, switched off the girl’s phone and so her parents were unable to contact her, the officer said. On Monday morning, the girl’s parents also spoke to the constable and told him that their daughter was missing. The constable met her parents in the CBS area and allegedly said that he would help trace her. Suryawanshi said that the girl’s parents were suspicious that their daughter was with the constable. They registered a complaint with the Mhasrool police station around noon on Monday, telling the police that they suspected the constable in their daughter’s abduction. The police traced the two to the Nanduri Naka area of the city around 2 pm. The girl was handed over to her parents. The police said that a medical check-up of the girl would be done so that additional charges can be brought against the constable, if need be. The constable is attached to the Motor Transport Department of the police. However, he has been on sick leave for over 10 months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-police-constable-kidnaps-minor-girl-held/articleshow/86208442.cms||Santosh Sonawane
---||Mumbai||With Rs 73,000 crore arrears, Maharashtra may plunge into darkness||MUMBAI: The financial crisis at state-run Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Co Ltd (MSEDCL) deepened, with cumulative arrears due to non-payment of bills surging to Rs 73,879 crore and debt rising to Rs 45,440 crore. Energy minister Nitin Raut said the state will be plunged into darkness if MSEDCL’s arrears are not cleared. TimesViewMounting debt and soaring arrears will gravely impact MSEDCL’s power supply functions. The state-run company has nearly three crore consumers and payment of bills is required for its day-to-day functioning and expansion of infrastructure for uninterrupted power supply. The government must incentivize payment of dues rather than take harsh steps of disconnecting connections. Also, the department should put its house in order and reduce wasteful expenditure.A meeting to find a solution to ever-mounting losses was chaired by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday and was attended by nearly a dozen cabinet ministers. Raut said the highest outstanding of Rs 49,575 crore was from agricultural consumers, while nearly Rs 8,000 crore was uncleared by inter-governmental departments like water supply schemes. Officials said the department sought Rs 20,000 crore as loan guarantee for liquidity, but no assurance was given by Thackeray regarding the financial package. Raut said mismanagement during BJP rule led to an increase in pending dues. The arrears in 2014-15 stood at Rs 23,224 crore, which soared to Rs 59,833 crore in 2019-20. “As soon as we took charge we were hit by the pandemic, then there were natural calamities like cyclones and a deluge, which led to a huge loss of electricity infrastructure. We have floated an expression of interest seeking help from international consultants to tide over the situation,” said Raut. He said once the consultant submits a report giving solutions they will take it to the cabinet for approval and action. Raut said the government was considering splitting MSEDCL into divisional companies. Sources said many ministers, including those of Congress, were critical about MSEDCL’s functioning. “Despite huge losses, it approved purchases of many cars. Cost of electricity production is higher due to poor quality of coal. There is huge discrepancy in meters, especially for agricultural consumers. They need to get their house in order,” said a senior minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-with-rs-73k-cr-arrears-state-may-plunge-into-darkness/articleshow/86216218.cms||Bhavika Jain
---||Mumbai||Only 0.35% of fully vaccinated Mumbaikars got Covid: Report||MUMBAI: Around 0.35% of fully vaccinated Mumbaikars -- or 350 out of every 1 lakh – have suffered breakthrough Covid-19 infection, according to a BMC report. The term ‘breakthrough infection’ indicates an infection despite being vaccinated against it. There have been fears of people getting Covid despite immunisation, but the BMC report proves such numbers are low. “Our report shows that only a fraction of those vaccinated get affected. Clearly, there should be no reason for vaccine hesitancy,’’ said BMC additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. The report was collated last month when the number of those who have taken both shots of Covishield, Covaxin or Sputnik stood at 25.39 lakh. Of these, 9,001 got Covid-19. (On Tuesday, the fully vaccinated tally had increased to 31.32 lakh). A doctor associated with the BMC vaccination programme said the updated report which is being finalized showed that breakthrough infections amount to only 0.3%. The age-wise breakup of those infected despite taking their shots shows those over 60 years seem more vulnerable to the SARS-CoV-2 virus depite inoculation. While 4,479 out of 7.58 lakh senior citizens (0.59%) got Covid, only 1,835 of the 6.94 lakh in the 18-44 age group were similarly affected. “Even among the vaccinated people, senior people are more prone to the infection,” said BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare. Mortality and severity of Covid infection has been higher among senior citizens than younger people across the world. The age-related skew could be due to higher incidence of chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertensions among the elderly. “The other reason could be that vaccination for senior citizens started in March and the antibody titre could be dropping already and resulting in infections,” said a doctor who didn’t want to be named.  BMC also analysed data of Covid infections among those who had taken only one shot. Of the 41.7 lakh in this category (when the report was prepared), 14,329 (0.34%) had got infected. Elderly were again the worst hit: 1.52% of 3.28 lakh senior citizens (5,004) got Covid. In comparison, 0.41% of the 18-44 age group (or 4,420 out of 31.76 lakh) got similarly infected. Of 6.7 lakh in the 45-59 age group who got the first Covid shot, 4,815 (0.72%) got infected. The report is based on data from civic ward-level war rooms; every Covid-positive person is contacted by the local ward office and asked about vaccination status. “There could be some reporting error, but the numbers are broadly indicative of vaccine’s ability to protect against severe Covid infection,” said a BMC officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/only-0-35-of-fully-vaccinated-mumbaikars-got-covid-report/articleshow/86213437.cms||Malathy Iyer
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Book on Dharavi reveals how backend Covid warriors led from front||MUMBAI: Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday released a book ‘The Dharavi Model’, which chronicles BMC’s fight against Covid-19 in Dharavi, Asia biggest slum. The book is written by Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner, G-north ward, under which Dharavi falls. Dighavkar was one the key faces in BMC’s fight against Covid-19 in Dharavi and had led from the front during the first and second waves since the pandemic broke out in March 2020. The book has first-person accounts of frontline workers and officials who were part of the fight. It detail how BMC tracked the first case of coronavirus in the slum pocket, to food distribution during the first nationwide lockdown, opening of clinics across Dharavi and door-to-door screening of residents. The book also talks about worldwide praise for the Dharavi model and backend warriors who led from the front, which includes doctors, other medical staff, and those deployed in ward war rooms over the last 18 months. Thackeray has written the foreword for the book. Dighavkar recalls in the book from April 1, 2020, “Suddenly, a phone call broke my flow of watching… Aaplya Dharavi mahde case aali aahe (We have a case in Dharavi), said a person from the testing lab. I wanted to pinch myself and tell myself that this was untrue. I could fathom the gravity of it going forward. We had been stamping people from UAE and Kuwait and not only asking them to stay indoors, but also deploying cops to make sure they adhered to this isolation. On April 1, the first case of Dharavi did not give me time to prepare. A spontaneous decision was taken to divide our teams in 2 and visit Dilshad Shaikh. Dilshad, a 56-year-old garment unit owner, was Dharavi’s first coronavirus case. A team visited his house and put the entire family of 10 in quarantine and sealed the building with 380 flats.” Dighavkar also wrote about a call from Thackeray in mid-April 2020 when he was browsing the Internet to see how major global cities were tackling the deadly virus. “I was scrolling, my phone was suddenly interrupted as a landline number flashed on the screen. The voice on the other end said, ‘I am calling from Matoshree and the CM wants to have a word with you. The voice itself left me perturbed. Countless questions entered my mind at once. I thought about what had gone wrong. What’s the information he wants? Kashe Aahat Dighavkarji? Mi Uddhav Thackeray bolton (How are you, Mr Dighavkar, Uddhav Thackeray speaking) I told him I was fine and and before I could talk about work, he asked how my family was? I called to say that you are doing a great job and you must keep it up’,” Dighavkar wrote. Dharavi has an estimated population of over 7 lakh residents and is spread across 2.1 sq km. There are around 5,000 small businesses and industrial units in Dharavi. The first coronavirus case in Dharavi was reported on April 1, 2020, nearly 20 days after the first patient was found in Mumbai on March 11. Dharavi became a hotspot of coronavirus infection again in early April this year. The slum colony, said to be Asia’s largest, reported the highest (99) Covid-19 cases on April 8. Dighavkar led the fight and roped in celebrities like actor Ajay Devgn and corporates to chip in with money to buy equipment, food kits and more recently for vaccination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-book-on-dharavi-reveals-how-backend-covid-warriors-led-from-front/articleshow/86215497.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar
---||Chandigarh||YouTuber booked for blackmailing showroom owner||Hisar: Police have registered a case of blackmail and extortion against a YouTuber and three of his friends for allegedly demanding money from the owner of a garment showroom and defaming the shop by uploading a video. The police have started an investigation, but no arrest has been made so far. Urban Estate police registered a case on the complaint of Manoj Kumar, a resident of Rampura Mohalla in Hisar, against Mohit Panu, the operator of the YouTube channel ‘News Age Nation’, and his three associates under Sections 384 (extortion), 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 67 (publishing or transmitting obscene material in electronic form) of the IT Act. In the complaint to the police, Manoj said his son Gaurav had a showroom of readymade garments. Mohit Panu along with some of his associates had come to his shop and said he runs ‘News Age Nation’ channel and demanded Rs 10,000 every month or else he will defame the showroom. After this, he started asking for clothes for himself and his friends for free, but he refused, Manoj alleged. He said on July 9, Mohit had again visited the shop with his three companions and repeated the same demand, but he refused to pay the money. But Mohit picked up clothes from the showroom and threatened to spoil the image of the showroom by uploading a video on his channel, Manoj added. He said on July 12 and July 13, he got calls from many customers who informed him that Mohit had uploaded a video against the showroom. Police said after registering a case in this regard, the investigation has been handed over to ASI Sarjudin, but no arrest has been made so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/youtuber-booked-for-blackmailing-showroom-owner/articleshow/86213165.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||BJP: Weak legal representation caused OBC quota scrapping||Aurangabad: Stepping up its attack on the ruling MVA government over scrapping of political reservation for the OBCs in local self-governing bodies, the local BJP unit on Tuesday alleged that a weak legal presentation led to the debacle. While the state election commission has declared by-polls for six zilla parishads and panchayat samitis in respective districts without OBC reservation as per ruling from the Supreme Court, BJP leaders also announced protest from Wednesday as a part of a state-wide agitation planned by the party over the issue. Addressing reporters here on Tuesday, local BJP MLA and party general secretary for Marathwada Atul Save alleged that the state government miserably failed in the legal battle over the OBC quota issue in the apex court. “Even the state Congress chief Nana Patole has publicly said that MVA government did not give a lawyer to present its side before the Supreme Court. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and NCP chief Sharad Pawar owe an explanation over such a grave lapse,” he said. Save also alleged that the state government kept the state Backward Class Commission fund-starved when it needed official backing to collect the empirical data of OBCs. Accusing the state government of backstabbing the OBC community, BJP city president Sanjay Kenekar said the ruling parties were not keen to protect the political rights of the community concerned. “The chief minister repeatedly said that polls for local self-governing bodies would not take place sans OBC quota. Such rhetoric proved of no use as poll schedule has been out. We would launch a rigorous protest against the government by involving the OBC community,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/bjp-weak-legal-representation-caused-obc-quota-scrapping/articleshow/86208509.cms||---

The only exception to this is Mysuru-Bengaluru Expressway which connects Bengaluru with Mysuru, Mandya, Ramanagar cities beside many taluk headquarters.However, once the work on 10-lane Expressway is completed, it will be converted into an access-controlled road making toll payment compulsory, which is likely to result in an increase in the bus fare and other transport costs. A few argue that as the new road will bring down travel time, and so the nominal toll charge is acceptable.The inter-state Mysore-Wayanad Road has two toll plazas which are opposed by the farmers. As the work on 10-lane road project is nearing competition, locals, including regular commuters and farmers are worried over the high toll fee.Mysuru MP Pratap Simha had announced the project cost is expected to increase by another Rs 700 crore from estimated Rs 8,066 crore after he held a meeting with NHAI member (projects) RK Pandey, project director BT Shridhar and other officials in which it was decided to acquire additional land to provide entry and exit to Badari, Ramanagar, Channapatna, Maddur, Mandya, Srirangapatna beside constructing a bridge across river Shimsha in Maddur. A new flyover is also proposed at the Mysuru city entry point.The activists have raised eyebrows at the toll collection rule followed in two toll booths in Mysuru and Chamarajanagar districts where monthly passes have been made mandatory even for the non-commercial vehicles within a distance of 20km from the toll plaza. They fear that once toll collection begins, it will have a negative impact on all sectors including agriculture, tourism and transportation among others.Federation of Lorry Owners and Booking Agents’ Association president GR Shanmugappa said converting the Bengaluru-Mysuru Road into an access-controlled road by collecting toll is highly unscientific. “From farmers to traders, industrialists, all stakeholders will end up paying more money. It will make farming and related activities unviable,” he warned.“Today, for goods transportation between Hubballi and Bengaluru, we are paying Rs 4,000 as toll in several points. Same will repeat on the Bengaluru-Mysuru stretch. Once the toll collection begins, it will continue for an indefinite period of time. The governments are using the new roads to make money. We are against this,” he said.Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha state president Badagalapura Nagendra informed that toll collection from farmers is causing a lot of heartburn already on Wayanad Road. “Farmers will be affected more if toll collection is started on Mysuru-Bengaluru stretch. We will not allow anyone to set up toll plazas,” he said.However, Federation of Mysuru Organisations president Prashanth BS said he welcomes a nominal toll. “Today time is money. This road will save travel time between two cities. So, I welcome the nominal toll,” he said.Project implemented in an unscientific way: Sumalatha Mandya MP Sumalatha Ambareesh said in her constituency limits, the project is being implemented in an unscientific way which has resulted in many protests. “The road is being developed in such a way that farmers are forced to travel for kilometer together to reach their fields, causing inconvenience. This is a lifetime project. So, while implementing it, the concerns of all the stakeholders should be addressed,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/farmers-oppose-toll-collection-on-mysuru-bengaluru-expressway/articleshow/86208605.cms||Shrinivasa M
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: SC asks railways to pay Rs 35,000 to passenger for train delay||ALWAR: In a rare case, the Supreme Court has upheld a tribunal order directing the Indian Railways to pay Rs 35,000 to a passenger for the delay in arrival of a train, resulting in him missing his connecting flight and being forced to hire a taxi to reach his destination. Sanjay Shukla, a resident of Alwar, had booked tickets for himself and his family for Jammu on Jammu-Tawi Express on June 11, 2016. But the train reached the destination four hours late. So, he missed his flight to Srinagar. He had to hire a taxi and he lost his advance booking for a boat ride on Dal Lake. He had to travel 12 hours by taxi to reach Srinagar, which would have been a 20-minute flight, due to the fault of the Railways. Sanjay approached the district consumer court in Alwar seeking compensation for the financial loss and mental torture. The consumer forum asked the Railways to pay him Rs 35,000, which included the taxi fare of Rs 15,000, advance booking of boat ride of Rs 10,000, Rs 5,000 as family expenses and Rs 5,000 for mental torture. The Railways challenged the order in the high court and tribunal, but both the courts upheld the order. It was then challenged in the Supreme Court. But there too the Railways had to face embarrassment after the apex court upheld the consumer court order.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/sc-asks-railways-to-pay-rs-35kto-passenger-for-train-delay/articleshow/86215507.cms||---

The number is almost double of patients reporting at these fever desks in the first week of September when the average daily count was around 600 patients. “In all, the number of fever patients in the city currently is at least 20% higher than normal,” said a health department official. “As in fever season every year, patients are of different age groups and there is nothing alarming on this ground. Moderate temperature along with high moisture and humidity in monsoon cause seasonal fever,” he added. As per health department data, as many as 72,609 patients have reported at the 19 fever desks in government hospitals in the city since June 1. Of these,8,220 patients had to be admitted. On an average, 684 fever patients have reported to fever desks per day in the 106 days since June 1. This is 15% higher than the daily average of the non-monsoon period. The fever cases started increasing gradually in September, with the daily count rising from 603 on September 4 to 1,004 on Tuesday in a span of 10 days. As per norms, samples of fever patients collected by the health department are tested for dengue and malaria. If the sample is positive for a specific disease, the patient is provided treatment accordingly, however, if the sample is negative for these diseases, it is considered a case of seasonal fever and the patient is treated symptomatically, said doctors in the chief medical officer office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/fever-cases-surge-over-1000-patients-turn-up-at-govt-hosps/articleshow/86215492.cms||Yusra Husain

---||Delhi||Delhi cops arrest man who helped jailed conman launder over Rs 100 crore||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police’s Economic Offences Wing has arrested an alleged hawala dealer in the case of extortion of Rs 200 crore from a well-known business family in the country by jailed conman Sukesh Chandrasekhar. The accused has been identified as Avtar Singh alias Dolly Kochar. The suspect is alleged to have laundered over Rs 100 crore of the siphoned money, cops said. Singh is an associate of another suspect named Deepak Ramnani already arrested in the case. Ramnani purportedly laundered the money for Chandrasekhar for a 7% commission through Singh. The money was laundered in cash and through shell companies in Mumbai, Chennai and Hyderabad apart from Hong Kong and other foreign locations. Earlier, the cops had arrested actress Leena Maria Paul in connection with the case, two weeks after she was quizzed by the Enforcement Directorate. Paul’s boyfriend, Chandrasekhar, was the first to be arrested from jail along with seven others, including a bank manager, for their alleged involvement in the extortion case. He has been booked under the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organized Crime Act (MCOCA). His associates, including Paul, will also be an accused under MCOCA. On August 10, TOI was the first to report on the biggest-ever extortion case reported in Delhi in terms of the amount of money and that the ED had started a parallel probe. On August 23, ED had seized 16 high-end cars, a luxurious beachfront bungalow located in Chennai, Rs 82.5 lakh in cash and 2kg of gold. The EOW has also arrested the manager of RBL Bank, Connaught Place Branch and two of his associates on charges of allegedly facilitating and laundering money for Chandrasekhar. The accused manager was identified as Komal Poddar and his aides as Avinash Kumar and Jitender Narula. “The accused were involved in dubious transactions for circulation of funds and arrangement of cash,” the EOW had said. Chandrasekhar was using the number spoofing technology to impersonate high-ranking government officials. He would call the targets to strike deals and the victims would see the numbers on the screen as desired by him. In one of the last calls to a victim, Chandrasekhar had impersonated the law secretary, a source said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/cops-arrest-man-who-helped-jailed-conman-launder-over-rs-100cr/articleshow/86213318.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: BJP to use PM Narendra Modi's event to launch poll campaign||LUCKNOW: Even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone of a state university in the name of Jat icon Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh in Aligarh and reviewed the progress of the defence corridor on Tuesday, the BJP state brass was busy drafting a detailed blueprint for its campaign to project its development-oriented face on the completion of four-and-a-half years of rule in Uttar Pradesh on September 19. A top government official told TOI that data of development work, employment generation and measures taken on the law and order front are being centrally compiled. “It will also be shared with public representatives,” the official said. In fact, political analysts viewed PM Modi’s event in Aligarh as launch of BJP’s pre-election campaign from the restive west UP, which is witnessing agitation by farmers, mainly Jats of the region. The Aligarh node of defence corridor is projected to get investment of around Rs 1,250 crore and would boost economic activity in the region besides generating employment for 6,700 people. BJP’s organisational machinery, meanwhile, has rolled up its sleeves for holding ‘chaupals’ in all 27,700 ‘Shakti Kendras’ (covering five to six polling booths) across the state on September 19 to highlight the achievements of the Yogi Adityanath government. From September 20, the party MLAs will hit the ground in their respective constituencies for connecting with voters and informing them about the government’s feats, development and welfare schemes. The party functionaries will also distribute specially-prepared leaflets and campaign material during their door-to-door campaign from September 26. Experts said CM Yogi has already switched to campaign mode and inaugurated, laid the foundation of new projects in Sant Kabir Nagar and Kushinagar districts of east UP and will be further touring the state extensively. They added that BJP is in no mood to lie low and allow the Opposition to firm up in the run up to UP assembly elections.

This is owing to the rise in the number of students seeking admission in them.The difficulties induced due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and demand for fees from private institutions have made parents opt for government schools. The education department has established Karnataka Public Schools (KPS) and English-medium schools to provide quality education, that is on par with private English-medium schools. There are 1,617 government, aided and private schools in the district, of which 12 schools are KPS, and 65 schools are English-medium schools. As per the education policy, which directs the schools to have pupil-teacher ratio (PTR) of under 30:1, there should be not more than 30 students in a class.As there is a growing demand from parents to admit their children to government English-medium schools, deputy director of public instructions (DDPI) Ramachandra Raje Urs, has written a letter to the education department commissioner, seeking permission to run eight additional English-medium schools in the district.DDPI Ramachandra Raje Urs told TOI that there is good response from parents to admit their children to government English-medium schools in the district.“As there are guidelines to not to have more than 30 students in each classroom, the admissions had to be restricted. Wherever we receive more applications than the available seats, we select the students through a lottery system. The high school headmasters will be given responsibility for students’ admissions, and in KPS, the principal will look into admissions,” he said.Another official said that there is a demand from parents to admit their children to government schools. “So we have urged the commissioner for an additional eight schools,” he said.Schools in Kodagu to reopenMadikeri: Based on the recent decline in Covid positivity rate in Kodagu, the district administration has ordered for the reopening of schools and junior colleges from September 17.

UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh said that institutions were being constructed in memory of national heroes. “The Samajwadi Party chief should tell what he had done this during his term. During SP’s rule no effort was made to permanently record the memory of great men in history,” Singh said. Swatantra Dev charged the opposition parties of getting scared in the name of bulldozers. He said that it seems those who promoted encroachments are now suffering. “The mafia and criminals were given protection in the SP governments leading to ‘jungle raj’,” he said, adding that if bulldozers were being run over encroachments, then only the patrons were bound to suffer the most.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/sp-govt-made-no-effort-to-keep-memories-of-great-men-bjp/articleshow/86215560.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

They have decided to write to the government seeking its guidance on running the universities without temporary staff as they are facing a huge shortage of permanent faculty.Karnataka State Dr Gangubai Hangal Music and Performing Arts University VC Nagesh V Betakote said this circular is not new to his university. “But I am pressurised against implementing the government order. I have made it clear in the university syndicate meeting that government orders can’t be implemented. So, now misinformation is being spread against me,” he said.“We don’t have funds to pay for the salaries for our staff as we only got Rs 50 lakh as development fund from the state government. We don’t have affiliated institutes or a large number of students to ensure a healthy financial position. We don’t have any permanent faculty either. These are major challenges,” he explained.University of Mysore (UoM) registrar R Shivappa informed that he will write to the state government seeking guidance on implementing the order as the university is now run with the help of temporary staff.“Vice-chancellors have the power to recruit temporary employees. To ensure better ranking and time-bound services to the students, many temporary staff are appointed over a period of time. The number of departments have now increased to 72 from the original 40. There is no permission to recruit the permanent staff either. So, we will seek government suggestion in this regard,” he said.According to a VC from a state university, it is high time to ensure that even the temporary staff are recruited by following rule books. “Currently, a large number of temporary staff are recruited without following any guidelines. Kin of elected representatives and academicians etc are hired. Later they move to court, seeking perks. It is like an injustice to the deserving candidates who struggle to get jobs even after academic excellence. So, the government must act strictly,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/varsities-in-a-fix-after-govt-order-on-temporary-staff/articleshow/86208676.cms||Shrinivasa M

The next date for hearing her bail plea has been rescheduled to September 18. Ambejogi-based additional government pleader Ashok Kulkarni said the additional sessions court that was supposed to hear the matter was on a pre-scheduled leave due to which the additional charge of the court was with sessions judge VK Mande. “The court holding additional charge was ready to hear the plea, but neither the police filed their reply nor the applicant’s side filed their response,” he said. Another lawyer from the court maintained that the court holding charge for regular bail is on pre-scheduled leave till September 16. As there is holiday on account of Mukti Sangram Day, the regular court will resume on Saturday when her bail plea would be heard. Sharma-Munde and Arun More were booked on September 5 after they reached Parli to hold a news conference against social justice minister Dhananjay Munde. However, women activists as well as Munde’s supporters strongly opposed the move and disrupted Sharma-Munde’s attempts of holding the news conference. It was while stepping out of Parli Vaijyanath, a scuffle broke out between Sharma-Munde, More and a group led by 37-year-old Vishakha Ghadge of the Women Economic Development Corporation. In her complaint, Ghadge has alleged that Sharam-Munde assaulted one Baby Tamboli and when her kin Guddu tried to save her, More alleged attacked him with a sharp-edged weapon. Following the incident, More was remanded to two-day police custody, while Sharma-Munde was remanded in judicial custody and since then the duo has been in custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/karuna-sharma-mundes-bail-hearing-scheduled-for-sept-18/articleshow/86208681.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Delhi||Delhi: Karol Bagh, 3 other sites may get off-street parking||NEW DELHI: North Delhi Municipal Corporation has approved a first-of-its-kind proposal for constructing four multilevel parking lots on Ajmal Khan Road (Bank Street), Old Rajendra Nagar, Shastri Park and Pusa Lane after converting these properties into freehold. The project will need the approval of the House before tenders are invited. Standing committee chairman Jogi Ram Jain said the parking lots would address the long-pending demand by traders for developing off-street parking in Karol Bagh and neighbouring areas to decongest the roads. “We tried to develop the parking lots after leasing out the properties multiple times in the past few years and even reduced the cost, but no response was received. A decision was then taken to make these properties freehold and the final reserve price was increased by 25%. However, we will continue to run 75% of the parking lots,” added Jain. After making the properties freehold, the civic body would lose ownership rights. An official said the proposal was updated based on amendments made by DDA in Delhi Master Plan 2021 giving relief in the height of parking facilities. Leader of the House Chhail Bihari Goswami said, “There won’t be any restriction on the height of parking lots, provided they get the approval of the agencies concerned, such as Delhi Urban Art Commission, Archaeological Survey of India and the fire department. However, the amendment has put restrictions on areas for commercial use. For a parking lot on a 3,000 sqm plot, FAR for commercial use can be 100%, but for plots above 3,000 sqm, 60% FAR will be allowed. Since all these plots are above 3,000 sqm, the second condition will be applicable.” The total area of the Ajmal Khan Road parking lot is 4,115 sqm. Currently, it is being used for surface parking. Space would be created for parking at least 500 vehicles. Earlier, the reserve price was Rs 157.6 crore, but now it has been increased to Rs 175.6 crore. The Shastri Park facility would have a provision of 577 vehicles with a site area of 4,806 sqm. The reserve price has been kept at Rs 119.4 crore. For the Old Rajendra Nagar project, the area of the plot is 3,871.3 sqm with a provision for parking 464 vehicles. For Pusa Lane, the reserve price has been fixed at Rs 148 crore. Unlike other projects, it was conceived recently with a provision for 381 cars.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/karol-bagh-3-other-sites-may-get-off-street-parking/articleshow/86244121.cms||Vibha Sharma
---||Chandigarh||Darabassi declared NAC for violating air quality standards: CPCB||Barinderjit.Saluja Mohali: Derabassi has been declared a Non-Attainment City (NAC) for consistently violating air quality standards. The town has failed to meet the National Ambient Air Quality Index continuously for five years. Derabassi has been named as the one city out of 94 Non-Attainment Cities (NAC) which have consistently violated air quality standards throughout the country by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). Additional deputy commissioner (G) Komal Mittal said cities are declared NAC if they consistently do not meet the National Ambient Air Quality Index over a five-year period. Mittal said an Action Plan has been prepared to take counter measures in Derabassi, under which pollution check centers have been upgraded and efforts are being made to de-congest vehicular traffic at main light points. “To remove the tag of Non-Attainment City, Derabassi will soon be equipped with a mechanical sweeping system, water sprinkler, electric vehicle charging stations and electric vehicle-based waste collectors,” she said. Mittal said that construction work on two parking zones has started on tehsil road and the area adjoining the vegetable market of the city. She said that the traffic police strictly monitored the area with a smart CCTV system. An awareness campaign is underway in schools and other areas to sensitise people about the ill-effects of pollution through online seminars, camps and public meetings, she said. Emphasising on regular checking of pollution emission in vehicles, the ADC (G) said the focus was on electric vehicles in Derabassi. The PPCB and RTA secretary were told that some charging infrastructure would be set up in coordination with prominent industries. She also said that electric behicle-based waste collectors would be designated to collect waste from houses in the city. Instructing the municipal council to buy a mechanical sweeper system at the earliest, she said these systems would prove beneficial in enhancing air quality. She also called for optimum use of water sprinklers to ameliorate air quality. She stressed the need to control burning of municipal solid waste and regular checks by the MC and asked the police to ensure uninterrupted flow of traffic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/darabassi-declared-nac-for-violating-air-quality-standards-cpcb/articleshow/86210888.cms||---

The forest and wildlife department has rescued two red sand boas, a common sand boa, a juvenile peacock and 62 rose-ringed parakeets from the possession of those arrested. A dead peacock was also recovered. According to a forest official, two people were arrested after they smuggled the parakeets to a market near Red Fort. In another incident, two snakes, including a red sand boa and a common sand boa, were rescued from Indira Vikas Colony. They were in captivity of two snake charmers, who have been arrested. In a separate incident, two more snake charmers were arrested from Park Street, Seelampur, and a red sand boa was seized from the accused people. The arrested people have been booked under the relevant sections of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. Aditya Madanpotra, deputy conservator of forests (Central), said, “All the six arrested accused were produced before the magistrate. People should report cases of captive snakes immediately to the forest department.” Meanwhile, an injured nilgai was also rescued after it strayed into human habitation. In July this year, a man was arrested near Kashmere Gate ISBT with leopard claws, teeth and other body parts by Delhi forest and wildlife team in a joint operation with Wildlife Crime Control Bureau. The forest department had also launched an integrated tree and wildlife helpline number — 1800118600 — earlier this year where complaints regarding wildlife trafficking or wildlife in distress can be made.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/six-arrested-for-wildlife-related-offences-in-separate-cases/articleshow/86213354.cms||---

Sharma said the MC has submitted it does not have information on crucial aspects related to paid parking, CCTV camera installations, contractor payments and available parking slots. “The BJP-led MC is refusing to provide the copies of the agreements it has entered into with all the paid parking contractors in the name of trade secrets and intellectual property,” the former councillor alleged. “These are some of the glaring revelations that have come to light, thanks to a recent RTI application I filed. It is quite clear that MC is intentionally being evasive in its replies. The real question is who are they trying to protect, and at whose behest? Mayor Ravi Kant Sharma must take full responsibility for not ensuring accountability of the MC and resign immediately,” Sharma added. In its RTI reply of August 13, the MC has reportedly revealed that it imposes parking fines ranging from Rs 500 to Rs 10,000. At the same time MC has refused to divulge the details of the amounts on account of penalty/violation, claiming that the information is “scattered across dozens of files”. The MC has stated in the reply of the RTI that it does not even maintain basic data on the number of two-wheelers and four-wheelers that can be accommodated within its paid parking sites, Sharma claimed. The MC has also claimed that it does not have any information on whether its contractors/licensees have been making payments for electricity connections of all the paid parking lots, Sharma said. “BJP is supporting the parking mafia and harassing the public in the name of smart parking. There is nothing smart in the paid parking except being an organized racket by the BJP. How can the MC deny supplying such essential information? How can the MC not have any idea of the number of paid parking slots available under its direct supervision and jurisdiction, especially when it pertains to crucial and sensitive queries around CCTV cameras, which have a direct impact on the safety of Chandigarh’s citizens, especially women’s security,” Sharma said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/bjp-led-mc-hiding-paid-parking-info-claims-aaps-sharma/articleshow/86210922.cms||---
---||India||ED alleges WB police bid to derail probe into Abhishek case||NEW DELHI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) moved the Delhi high court on Tuesday, challenging a pair of notices issued to it by Bengal police on the basis of an FIR lodged by Trinamool MP Abhishek Banerjee, who is under the agency's scanner for alleged money laundering linked to the illegal coal mining case. "The notices will not stand scrutiny even for a minute," additional solicitor general S V Raju said, terming these "patently illegal, malafide and a counter blast" to the ED investigation into Abhishek's alleged involvement in the case. The agency petitioned Justice Yogesh Khanna to quash the two notices and any subsequent notice that Bengal police might issue in connection with the FIR. Additional solicitor general Raju, appearing for ED, argued the notices were tantamount to "harassment" with a view to derail the probe into the illegal coal mining case. Justice Khanna deferred the hearing to September 21, saying the senior counsel representing Bengal would "take care" of the notices issued to the ED officers. Abhishek, a nephew of Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, had filed a police complaint against a news channel on April 5. Two notices were subsequently issued by a sub-inspector of Kalighat police station to ED officers investigating charges against the Diamond Harbour MP under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ed-alleges-wb-police-bid-to-derail-probe-into-abhishek-case/articleshow/86217723.cms||---

The wild incident took place late in the afternoon on Monday and has taken social media by storm since. Video shows how the man tried to overtake a the bus on a curve from the left side and his error would have proved near fatal had it not been for the bus driver to immediately applied the brakes after the motorcycle hit the front side of the bus. The man apparently misjudged the turn that the bus would take and his bike was thrown several meters ahead on the road, while the rider was ‘swallowed’ in the space between the road and the floor of the bus between the two front wheels. After the bus came to halt, people ran to check what happened when he surprised everyone by wriggling out from beneath the bus.

UP also holds the record of vaccinating the maximum number of people on a single day, leaving behind states like Maharashtra, Delhi, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal and many others.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Doctors operate upon man with rare combination of heart ailments||NEW DELHI: Doctors at a private hospital in the city recently operated on a 43-year-old man suffering from a rare combination of heart diseases — a tear in the part of aorta (main artery that carries blood away from the heart) where it exits the heart and an ascending aortic aneurysm (swollen and weakened area in an artery). He survived the complications due to timely surgical intervention that involved replacing a part of his aorta using an artificial graft and reconnecting the coronary arteries. According to doctors at Aakash Super Specialty Hospital, the patient had a malformation of the heart valve since childhood, which was detected only two months ago during a routine health check-up. However, the tear in the aorta and the aneurysm were discovered when he developed a tearing chest pain that travelled to his back recently. Dr Abhay Kumar, director, cardiac surgery at Aakash healthcare, who led the surgery, said type A aortic dissection — which the patient suffered from — is a potentially fatal disease. “If the patient waited another few days, a dilated part of the aorta would have ruptured that could have caused his sudden death,” he said. Dr Kumar added they conducted the Bentall procedure, which is an open-heart surgery that involves the use of an artificial aortic valve with artificial graft to replace a part of the aorta (the root) and reconnection of the coronary arteries. The process was invented in 1952 by Professor Hugh Bentall, a British cardiac surgeon, he said. According to Dr Kumar, Bentall procedure is a complex surgery but has an excellent survival rate — long-term survival of patients after surgery was 93% after five years and 89% after 10 years. Due to the combination of two rare conditions in this patient, Bentall was the only way in which he could have been treated without necessitating multiple operations, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/doctors-operate-upon-man-with-rare-combination-of-heart-ailments/articleshow/86213453.cms||---
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Tourism, hospitality see revival; business 50-70% of pre-Covid days, say hotels||PUNE: Tourism and hospitality sectors in Maharashtra are showing first signs of recovery after the second Covid wave struck. Hotels in Mahabaleshwar and Lonavla now have a healthy 50-70% business of the pre-Covid levels, top sources from the Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India told TOI on Tuesday. Sherry Bhatia, president of the association, said, “This is the first instance of room bookings picking up at these major tourist spots after the second wave began subsiding. We anticipate that the coming months would bring in more improvement in bookings.” Bhatia said his own resort in Murud-Janjira recently recorded occupancy of 60-70% of the pre-pandemic levels, a first in months. Hoteliers expect a significant increase in occupancy starting November, as against last year, because of the number of fully vaccinated people in Maharashtra and cases still being in check. “This will boost travellers’ confidence to head out,” Bhatia added. Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation resorts at these locations have now started clocking 90-95% occupancy in the last few weekends, regional manager Deepak Harane said. Poona Hoteliers Association (PHA) president Sharan Shetty said hotel occupancy in Pune has also doubled to 30% in comparison to the 10-15% figures a month ago. “Post-Diwali, we expect occupancy to increase further with corporate travel picking up. Families have also started enquiring about banquet bookings for weddings. The last few days have seen an increase in enquiries translating into tangible bookings.” Travel companies have seen a significant surge too. Travel portal iXigo sources said that based on booking trends on its website and app, flight bookings have crossed 60% of the pre-Covid levels with airlines consistently carrying more than two lakh passengers every day. “Train travel in India is seeing a faster recovery than flight travel with an increase in reserved train ticketing. Train ticketing now stands at around 80% , while bus bookings are around 50% of the pre-pandemic levels. We are seeing an uptick in hotel bookings too,” Aloke Bajpai, iXigo’s co-founder and group chief executive officer, said. Rajeev Kale, president and country head of Holidays, MICE, Visa for Thomas Cook India, said as per their company data there has been over 100% month-on-month increase in bookings. “We are seeing brisk business. It is back to pre-pandemic levels led by destinations like Leh-Ladakh, Kashmir, Himachal, Rajasthan, Andamans and Goa. Strong demand together with positive announcements on reopening of international borders and vaccine acceptance is seeing a surge in travel,” he added. Daniel D’Souza, president and country head, SOTC Travel, said, “Business has doubled in comparison with July. With the number of destinations opening up to fully vaccinated citizens, we expect to grow at the same rate for September.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/tourism-hospitality-see-revival-biz-50-70-of-pre-covid-days-say-hotels/articleshow/86213441.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Lucknow||UP: Seek data on law & order from home department: Samajwadi Party national president Akhilesh Yadav to PM Narendra Modi||LUCKNOW: Samajwadi Party national president Akhilesh Yadav on Tuesday questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s statement that crime has come down in UP and urged him to seek data from the state home department which would tell a different story. The comment came in response to a media query on the Prime Minister’s statement earlier in the day where he said that law and order in Uttar Pradesh has improved and that only mafia and gangsters ruled the roost before 2017 (when the SP was in power). The PM was addressing the gathering after laying the foundation stone of the Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh State University in Aligarh. “I have not heard what the Prime Minister has said. If you are quoting the PM correctly, I would urge him to seek data from the home department and ‘Dial 100’ (police control room). It would give him the real picture,” he said during a function where leaders from various parties joined the SP. He said the PM could also go through the National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB) report and also find out which state in the country had been served the most number of notices by NHRC. “The PM should ask the UP Chief Minister about the top 10 gangsters of the state. All are aware that the CM has withdrawn cases against himself,” he said. Taking a jibe at the BJP, he said, “Setting up a university is a welcome step but the BJP should also start an institute to train people in telling lies and spreading falsehood as they excel in it.” Referring to the alleged demolition of some houses in Ayodhya, he said the BJP should pick ‘bulldozer’ as its election symbol. Responding to CM Yogi Adityanath’s comment that opposition leaders lack vision, Akhilesh advised him to “get his eyesight tested to find out his vision”. Earlier, Akhilesh took to twitter to describe BJP’s move to build a new university after Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh as ‘dhong’ (pretence). “It is a pity that BJP is setting up a new university named after Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh, who was opposed to communalism and narrow politics and who got the deposits of BJP candidates forfeited. BJP government disrespected him by declaring the Gurukul Vishwavidhyalaya made by him in Vrindavan as a fake university,” Akhilesh tweeted.He also accused the BJP of failing to honour its own leaders, referring to the foundation laying of a university after former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee in Lucknow in 2019. “The university is yet to be completed.

The suspects, between 20 and 22 years old, hail from Bhalki in Karnataka and were living in a rented room in the city for the past month-and-a-half, the police said. Fourteen cellphones, totally worth Rs2.65 lakh, were recovered from the suspects, the police said. The suspects would restore the stolen handsets to factory settings and sell them in the grey market back in Bhalki, the police added. The four youths — Manoj Kashinath Kasle (20), Shilarsaheb Mohammed Ismail Saudagar (20), Balaji Dhanraj Kasle (22) and Sherli Chandsaheb Shaikh (22) — had moved to Pune around the beginning of August and rented a room in Kasturba slum, off Aundh Road. They would move around the city on two motorcycles and mostly target women and pedestrians talking on the phone. Two suspects were caught on a CCTV camera snatching a phone from a woman. Following five complaints of cellphone snatching in the past couple of weeks, the Airport police had stepped up vigil in their limits. A team comprising senior inspector Bharat Jadhav and inspector Mangesh Patil received a tip-off on September 8 about the suspects, who were spotted riding two-wheelers without registration plates. The team nabbed the duo, who confessed under questioning. “The youths mostly targeted Chikhali, Bhosari, Vimannagar, Chandannagar, and Yerawada,” senior inspector Jadhav said. “After snatching the cellphones, the suspects would format and sell them for Rs 4,000-5,000,” he added. A crime branch officer said smartphones which can be easily unlocked and cannot be traced are sold two or three states away from where they were stolen. This way, the officer explained, the stolen phones cannot be traced. Smartphones which are password-protected are taken apart and their parts — mic, camera lenses and screens, etc — are sold to third-party mobile repair shops.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/4-from-karnataka-held-for-series-of-cellphone-thefts/articleshow/86213459.cms||Gitesh Shelke

As many as 2,406 cases, including both pulmonary TB and extrapulmonary TB, were reported in 2019. It came down to 1,628 cases in 2020 and 991 cases till September 13 in 2021, in the district. Though health authorities feel that Covid protocols might be one of the reasons for the decline in cases, they also point out hesitancy on the part of people to get tested fearing that they might test positive for Covid if they approach hospitals for treating cough and fever, which are also symptoms of TB, also led to drop in cases. The district also reported 27 TB cases when samples of 441 post-Covid patients were tested this year so far. “Pulmonary TB, which affects lungs, is spreading fast to other people when the infected person mingles in the community. We should strictly follow airborne infection control measures, including wearing masks, while stepping out of houses. This will help reduce spreading TB cases. While extrapulmonary TB is not spreading,” said Sarath Rao, TB programme officer in Ernakulam. The district also witnesses deaths due to TB especially in pulmonary TB cases as lungs get damaged beyond repair. TB often gets aggravated due to delay in availing treatment. It is also reported among guest workers too, but less compared to Keralites. The problem authorities’ face while providing treatment to infected guest workers is that contractors ask the patient to go back to his/her house. But the patient goes to other districts and in most cases, s/he will be unreachable on mobile numbers, thus spreading the infection. As restrictions are relaxed, authorities plan to conduct TrueNat tests of people with respiratory illness as it provides more accurate results. Rise of temperature in the evenings, cough for more than two weeks, weight loss and night chills are the symptoms of TB. However, health authorities said most often people with these symptoms buy medicine from medical shops to save money in availing treatment from hospitals. “Buying medicines from shops will be beneficial for a patient for the time being. But ultimately, the patient is going to lose,” said Rao. He said Covid infection does not cause TB. The 27 people might have had TB before they were infected with Covid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/covid-protocols-help-bring-down-tb-cases-in-district/articleshow/86211042.cms||T C Sreemol

While turning down the application seeking registration of attempt to murder case, JMFC NA Wankhede ruled: “I observe that the alleged act had a reasonable connection with the discharge of official duty, therefore, prior sanction is sine qua non even to order investigation.” The JMFC specifically recorded, “here the act alleged in the complaint purported to be done while discharging official duty, cognizance thereof cannot be taken unless requisite sanction of the appropriate authority”. Unhappy about the JMFC turning down his application, Naryalwale has appealed against the order before the sessions court. Meanwhile, eight policemen led by senior inspector Prashant Mahajan, who were suspended on charges of assaulting Naryalwale, have been reinstated and attached to the police control room. The alleged thrashing took place on April 9, however the video went viral on social media after a span of 47 days — on May 27. The video showed Narayalwale being thrashed by policemen team led by deputy superintendent of police Sudhir Khiradkar, who is currently under suspension after landing in an ACB trap. Reacting to the video, political bigwigs, including former CM Devendra Fadnavis and entire state BJP leadership, demanded action against the policemen. Initially, a police sub-inspector and four constables were suspended and later senior inspector Mahajan and three more constables were also suspended. Police have stated that 26-year-old gym owner Darshan Dewawale was seriously injured in an accident and was admitted in Deepak hospital where he died on April 9 following which Naryalwale along with his supporters ransacked the hospital where several critical patients were under treatment. Based on the complaint lodged by hospital’s security staff, some unidentified suspects were booked under relevant section of Maharashtra Medicare Service Persons and Medicare Service Institutions (Prevention of violence and damage or loss to property) Act – 2010.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/jmfc-turns-down-bjym-office-bearers-plea/articleshow/86208849.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Delhi||Rai directs all depts to make their own action plans to tackle winter pollution||New Delhi: Environment minister Gopal Rai has asked every department to prepare its own action plan by September 21 to tackle winter pollution. Based on all recommendations, Delhi government will release a final winter action plan by September 30. The development department has been directed to draft a timeline and an action plan to curb stubble burning, Rai said on Tuesday. Delhi government has sought an appointment with the Union environment minister. The municipal corporations, Delhi Development Authority, CPWD and PWD, Cantonment Board, irrigation and flood control department and other government bodies involved in construction work will focus on reducing dust pollution, Rai added. The key areas will be procurement of dust suppression chemicals, mechanical road sweeping, disposal plan for dust sucked from roads and awareness training for ground staff. “People throw garbage on the roadside and it is burnt. Residents welfare associations have said their guards burn wood or garbage to save themselves from cold,” said Rai. The corporations will find an alternative to tackle waste burning, he added. To reduce vehicular pollution, the transport department will promote electric vehicles and intensify monitoring of pollution certificates, while the traffic police will ensure decongestion and make arrangements to immediately remove vehicles that break down on road. The transport department will see that if a DTC or Cluster Scheme bus breaks down, a mechanic from the nearest depot fixes it, Rai said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rai-directs-all-depts-to-make-their-own-action-plans-to-tackle-winter-pollution/articleshow/86213492.cms||---

The deceased has been identified as K Kanimozhi, 17. The girl’s father Karunanidhi is a lawyer practising in Jayankondam court. Kanimozhi allegedly ended her life at her house at Thularankurichi near Udayarpalayam over fear of failure in the test, when her parents were attending a function at Ariyalur. Her elder sister is a student at a private college in Perambalur. Her family took her body to their native at Sathambadi in Ariyalur district, where her final rites were conducted. Sathambadi panchayat president Thanga Ravichandran said that the girl was a student of a private school at Namakkal and had scored 562 out of 600 in Class XII examinations. Her score in Class X was 469 out of 500. She appeared sad after appearing for NEET at a centre in Thanjavur as she had apprehension that she may not clear the exam. The Udayarpalayam police took up the investigation. This is the second such suicide in the state in the last two days. Dhanush, 19, of Mettur in Salem district had ended his life before appearing for NEET. Chief minister M K Stalin expressed shock over the death of Kanimozhi and sought to drive away NEET through legal means. “I assure the students and their parents that there will be no compromise on abolishing NEET with the consent of the President of India,” said the CM. The chief minister also said that impersonation, question paper leak and malpractices at the coaching centres proved that NEET is not an exam that weighs the eligibility of the students. Registering his condolence, former chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami asked the DMK to put an end to the ‘political drama’ over NEET and explain the reality to the students. The former CM also demanded the state government to provide counselling for the MBBS aspirants after appearing for NEET. Former chief minister O Panneerselvam said that it was disheartening that the students were taking such extreme steps, while all political parties in the state were raising pitch against the NEET. Calling it an unfortunate event, which should not happen to any student in future, TMC president G K Vasan MP said that political parties should not give any false hope to the students and their parents by politicising education. MDMK general secretary Vaiko demanded the central government to give consent to the anti-NEET bill tabled by the DMK government. “NEET imposed by the BJP cost the lives of 15 students in Tamil Nadu. The Constitution of India has vested the state government with the power of enacting a law over education in the concurrent list for protecting the interest of the state,” said Vaiko.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/ariyalur-girl-ends-life-a-day-after-neet/articleshow/86213480.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The state registered 3,530 cases against 2,740 on Monday, while the city tally rose to 367 from 345 in a 24-hour period. Daily deaths in the state rose from 27 to 52 on Tuesday. Coronavirus live updatesCovid testing had dropped due to Ganpati festivities in the last five days and the state health department has asked districts to increase the numbers. While 2.5 lakh tests were done daily on an average, it fell more than half to 1.1 lakh on September 12 and rose to 1.4 lakh on September 13.   In Mumbai, BMC authorities said testing had dropped marginally due to the festival holidays and reluctance among people. “But we have been conducting a sizeable number of tests daily unlike in some other districts,” said a BMC official. The BMC Covid update on Tuesday said 28,498 tests were conducted on the previous day, resulting in 367 cases and a test positivity rate of 1.2%.   Six of them were children at Oberoi Splendor society on Jogeshwari Vikhroli Link Road. Dr Mangala Gomare, executive health officer, said the children had attended a birthday party. “After one of them developed symptoms, they got tested and came positive,” she said, adding that the children were from different buildings.

Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the state’s task force, said the city’s Covid graph started changing a week after travel restrictions were lifted. “While no increase in cases was noticeable in the first week, the caseload grew by 20-30% in the next two weeks. At the moment, it seems to have plateaued around 350 cases daily.” If the health system keeps up the ‘testing, tracing and treatment’ policy, the plateau should stabilise further. “However, we need to wait till the festival season is over to check if the trend continues or if there is a rise in cases,” Pandit added. In the state, September 1 to 14 is probably the longest span when Vidarbha has not recorded a single Covid death since the pandemic started. The last fatalities — one each from Nagpur and Amravati — were reported on August 31. Last month, just 21 deaths across 11 districts were recorded. Officials said testing will be ramped up majorly to detect any surge in cases after the festive season.

---||Pune||Pune: Man gets 15 years in jail for raping 17-year-old||PUNE: A fast track special court has convicted and sentenced a 24-year-old man from Bhandgaon in Daund taluka to 15 years’ rigorous imprisonment for a sexual assault in September 2017 resulting in the pregnancy of a 17-year-old girl from the city. In December 2017, the survivor had to undergo a medical termination of pregnancy and the police then preserved the fetus for a DNA test by forensic experts, which established that the rape survivor and the accused were biological parents of the fetus. Special judge KK Jahagirdar upheld additional public prosecutor AS Brahme’s submission seeking maximum sentence for accused Rushiraj Babasaheb Shelke. The judge held that the accused deserved no leniency in punishment, considering the circumstances in which he committed the sexual assault and left the girl in the lurch. The court handed out the main 15-year sentence to Shelke for the offence under Section 5 (j) (ii) — which deals with sexual assault resulting in pregnancy of a female child — of the POCSO Act. It sentenced the accused to 12 years’ rigorous jail for offences under Section 376 (rape) of the IPC and 3 & 4 (sexual assault) of the POCSO Act. Both the sentences are to run concurrently. A few months before the registration of the case on December 20, 2017, with the Yerawada police, Shelke had approached the girl near her college. The two had then exchanged their numbers. In August 2017, he proposed to marry her. On September 18, 2017, Shelke took the girl to a lodge in Kondhwe Dhawade and forcibly established physical relationship with her. A few days later, the girl complained of stomach ache and the doctor told her and the parents that she was pregnant.

The medical university after revered Atal Bihari Vajpayee has become functional in Lucknow while the National Law University has been proposed in Prayagraj,” he said. The chief minister also took the opportunity to express gratitude to PM Narendra Modi for his support and guidance amid Covid-19 pandemic, especially in providing the Covid-19 vaccine. “Under PM Modi’s leadership, India has presented a model to the world on Covid-19 management. Today, India became successful in vaccinating 75 crore people which is a huge achievement and nearly nine crore people in Uttar Pradesh have been provided vaccine doses. No other country has supplied as many vaccines,” the CM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/govt-making-up-an-education-hub-yogi/articleshow/86215665.cms||Neha Lalchandani

---||Chandigarh||Punjab issues MBBS degree to Ludhiana doc on NCSC directions||Chandigarh: The Punjab government on Tuesday issued an MBBS degree to a Ludhiana-based doctor from a scheduled caste (SC) community on the directions of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC). The degree was withheld by college authorities due to amendments in the post-matric scholarship scheme for scheduled caste students. During a meeting in New Delhi on September 1, commission chairman Vijay Sampla asked Punjab government officials and college authorities to immediately release the degree of Dr Sheena Mattu. Dr Mattu had informed the commission that her scholarship amount was not paid by the state government. Dr Mattu got admission in Dayanand Medical College, Ludhiana, in 2015 under the ‘management quota' and she was paid scholarship amount for the first two years, but the state government decided to discontinue it after wrongly interpreting a circular from the central government. Therefore, the college had also refused to issue an MBBS degree to the student. “As per the central government’s circular issued in 2018, the state governments were asked to discontinue the scholarship scheme for the students seeking admission under the management quota. However, it was clearly mentioned in the circular that the beneficiaries, who were already enrolled to the scheme, will continue to get scholarship till completion of their courses whereas the students taking admission in 2017-2018 will not be given such benefits,” said Sampla. He explained the circular issued by the central government was applicable to those taking admissions in 2018 and onwards.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-issues-mbbs-degree-to-ludhiana-doc-on-ncsc-directions/articleshow/86213511.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Daylong downpour floods Kolkata, puts drainage infrastructure to test||KOLKATA: Frequent spells of heavy rain that began on Tuesday morning and continued till late evening inundated extensive parts of Kolkata, Salt Lake and Rajarhat. High tide in the Hooghly in the afternoon added to the woes in south Kolkata, particularly in areas along Tolly’s Nullah. As the downpour lashed the city between 11am and noon and again between 1pm and 2pm, the drainage infrastructure struggled to cope. KMC drainage pumping stations in Ultadanga, Belgachhia, Maniktala and Beerpara (RG Kar Road) received over 100mm rain in three hours. Low-lying areas in north and central Kolkata such as Thanthania, MG Road, Chittaranjan Avenue, Amherst Street, Camac Street went under water as the civic body’s drainage pumping stations were struggling to drain out storm water from major thoroughfares in the wake of fresh showers. Several south Kolkata thoroughfares, including Alipore Road, Belvedere Road, Harish Mukherjee Road, Rashbehari Avenue, Gariahat Road, Shamsul Huda Road, Diamond Harbour Road and Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Road experienced heavy rain and stayed waterlogged till late at night. Tarak Singh, a member in the KMC board of administrators overseeing the sewerage and drainage department, assured all efforts were being taken to drain out storm water. “We have pressed into service the majority of heavy-duty pumps at our drainage pumping stations to drain out storm water by tonight. We will give relief to residents of major parts of Kolkata if it doesn’t rain more,” Singh said. A section of drainage department officials were, however, concerned over low-lying pockets such as Kidderpore, Behala, Jadavpur, Garia and large areas off EM Bypass that lack a proper drainage network. “We are keeping ready portable pumps to flush out storm water from these areas,” said a civic official. The lashing rain and subsequent inundation of streets made traffic crawl. The scenes were particularly bad in areas such as Strand Road, Chittaranjan Avenue, MG Road, College Street, APC Roy Road, Camac Street, AJC Bose Road, Alipore Road, Gariahat Road, DH Road and NSC Bose Road (Tollygunge), among others. Some stretches of these major roads that have developed craters and crying for an urgent repair became a motorist’s nightmare. Large parts of Salt Lake and Rajarhat were inundated due to the heavy showers, with several road stretches of the IT hub heavily waterlogged. Office goers and commuters travelling to Sector V had to face a tough time to negotiate and wade through the roads with nearly knee-deep water in many places. Cars and other vehicles heading towards Sector V had to negotiate the potholed spots at several places. “Some roads in Sector V were waterlogged as there was very heavy rainfall within a short span of time and water was back-flowing from the drainage canal. All the four pumping stations in Sector V were operated to flush out the excess rainwater,” said an official of Nabadiganta Industrial Township Authority (NDITA).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/daylong-downpour-floods-city-puts-drainage-infra-to-test/articleshow/86211053.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi must cut PM2.5 by 58% to meet annual standards||NEW DELHI: With the rainy season nearing its end, Delhi is readying for winter, a time when air pollution hits a peak. A change in wind direction as the monsoon begins to withdraw from the region leads to a drop in wind speed and temperature, both of which trap local and wind-borne pollutants from neighbouring states. The winter action plan to combat pollution is expected to be released by the end of September. While data since 2015 does show the annual average PM2.5 level reducing each year, anti-pollution plans have to take into consideration that Delhi still needs to reduce its annual PM2.5 load by another 58% to meet national air quality standards. Track the pollution level in your cityIn 2020, when the city went into a lockdown due to Covid-19 and determined the ‘base’ pollution levels that could be achieved if key sectors are regulated, the capital still could not meet the national safe standard of 40 micrograms per cubic metre for PM2.5, logging a reading of 96 micrograms per cubic metre. An analysis by the Centre for Science and Environment on behalf of Central Pollution Control Board’s data from Delhi’s five oldest air quality monitoring stations — ITO, IHBAS, Mandir Marg, RK Puram and Punjabi Bagh — shows the annual average PM2.5 at 152 micrograms per cubic metre in 2015, but dropping to 127 in 2016, 120 in 2017, 118 in 2018 and 109 micrograms per cubic metre in 2019. By 2018, Delhi had 36 air monitoring stations and the average PM2.5 concentration that year based on all the 36 stations was 112 micrograms per cubic metre, still three times the acceptable limit. “The most recent data relates to 2019 because in 2020, the lockdown affected collection of data,” said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, CSE. “It is still clear that Delhi requires considerable improvement across sectors to reach anywhere close to the national standard for PM2.5.” Based on a three-year, rolling average method, however, when the annual average readings from 2018- 2020 are taken, Delhi’s annual average PM2.5 is 105 micrograms per cubic metre, which Chowdhury explains is a more accurate determination of the average pollution level. “Particulate pollution has begun to stabilise and decline, but the capital still needs to reduce the annual average PM2.5 by around 60%. There are big gaps in action at present. There is a need to scale up public transport, add walking and cycling infrastructure and implement parking restraints to reduce traffic volume. Delhi also needs to achieve 25% electrification of its vehicles, control pollution in small and medium scale industries and look at waste management infrastructure,” said Chowdhury. Dipankar Saha, former head of CPCB’s air laboratory, said alongside local action, there has to be coordination with other states to ensure that stubble burning and dust, two external factors, do not add to the local load. “Until the Aravalis are made green again, dust will be significant with winds blowing from Rajasthan towards Delhi. Stubble burning, meanwhile, constitutes 30-40% of Delhi’s PM2.5 load in the peak farm fire period,” said Saha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-must-cut-pm2-5-by-58-to-meet-annual-standards/articleshow/86213567.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

This decision was taken jointly with the consent of all elected representatives in a meeting chaired by municipal chairman Antony Ashanparambil. “Sir or Madam are terms used by British rulers to protect their special status as our rulers. Actually, Sir is an abbreviation of ‘Servant I Remain’ or ‘Slave I Remain’ to create a class difference between the laymen and senior officials,” said Ashanparambil. The chairman said he had taken the decision with the consent of all councillors to stop such a mode of address during all the future council meetings. The council asked the officials as well as people to address the councillors either by using their names or by adding the term councillors. The council on Tuesday also took the decision to address all the officials in the municipal office by calling them as per their official position. “With this, citizens visiting the municipal office for various purposes can address officials formally by mentioning their official status,’’ he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/municipality-bans-sir-madam/articleshow/86211081.cms||Sivadas Varma
---||Thiruvananthapuram||‘No sting ops showing judiciary in poor light’||Thiruvananthapuram: The controversy related to a leaked audio clip of a telephonic conversation between a judicial magistrate and a police officer, slyly recorded and publicised by the police officer, prompted the high court registrar to direct the state police chief to instruct the members of the force against using such tactics that would tarnish the judiciary before the public. Interestingly, instead of warning the police against such recording and leaking, the communique (accessed by TOI) by state police chief Anil Kant issued last Saturday addressed to ADGP (law and order), ADGP (crime branch), zonal IGs and the range DIGs, only says that all police officers should “be more vigilant while using social media platforms and avoid occurrences of such incidents in future, which will tarnish the reputation of the judiciary before the public”. The communique leaves the question unanswered whether it is permissible for the police officials to undertake such “sting operations” against officials or anyone else other than judicial officers. The communique issued by the state police chief explains the background of the matter in detail, which is an incident that happened in May this year. An audio clip purportedly that of the then judicial first class magistrate-1, Neyyattinkara, Tiara Rose Mary, was circulated through the social media. In the audio clip, allegedly recorded and forwarded by a policeman of Parassala police station, the magistrate was heard rebuking the police officer for repeatedly calling her on her official phone without manners. Subsequently, the magistrate had also issued an order to the police and excise inspectors in her jurisdiction forbidding them from calling her directly. After the audio clip went viral, the high court had transferred the magistrate from the post. On June 16, the high court registrar, in charge of district judiciary, had written to the state police chief stating that “it has been noticed that the act of the police personnel in recording the conversation and publishing the voice clip in social media has resulted in tarnishing the image of the judiciary in whole”. The registrar further requested the police chief to take necessary action and issue direction to avert the occurrences of such incidents in the future. The registrar’s directive had hinted at the background of the incident seeking action in such matters in the future. It was as a compliance measure that the state police chief has now issued a communique. Surprisingly, in the communique, the state police chief mentions the name of the concerned judicial magistrate and states that the “magistrate was heard using an unsavoury language against him in a conversation over mobile phone”. It further said that henceforth, any such act from the part of the police officers will be “viewed seriously and will attract disciplinary action”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/no-sting-ops-showing-judiciary-in-poor-light/articleshow/86211102.cms||KP Saikiran

It will be developed as a full-fledged tiger reserve equipped with all infrastructure. The decision was taken in the first meeting of Dudhwa Tiger Conservation Foundation on Tuesday. Minister for environment, forests and climate change Dara Singh Chauhan said the reserve should be developed on the lines of others. Amangarh is among the three tiger reserves of UP. The other two being Dudhwa Tiger Reserve and Pilibhit Tiger Reserve. The 80km reserve was notified in October 2012. It forms the buffer of Corbett reserve and tigers dispersing from Corbett find a home in Amangarh. One reason behind declaring it a reserve was to manage the population of tigers in the area. However, the reserve has remained underdeveloped all these years. Meanwhile, the minister also said that the ecotourism season will start from November 1 instead of November 15 in UP this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/amangarh-tiger-reserve-is-now-new-corbett-tiger-reserve/articleshow/86215694.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Assistant inspector Abhijit Jadhav of the Wakad police told TOI that the woman runs a food joint in Wakad area. “After closing late on Sunday night, she was returning home with her husband,” Jadhav said. There were stray dogs on the road and the woman’s husband went a little ahead to see that the dogs were gone. “That is when the suspect approached the woman on his bike and touched her improperly. He passed lewd comments at her,” he said. When the woman’s husband noticed him, the man fled. “She filed a complaint in the early hours of Monday against the suspect,” he said.

By merging of these areas, the city police are all set to have an MIDC Shendra police station. The proposal to merge Bidkin, Chikalthana, Khultabad and Phulambri police stations have been pending for long. Officials said there is a possibility of the CM making an announcement about the expansion of the Aurangabad city police commissionerate during his tour on the occasion of Mukti Sangram Day. By merging these areas, authorities at the DG office are all set to form an independent MIDC Shendra police station to cater to the needs of the core area belonging to the Aurangabad Industrial City, which is the country’s first well-planned and greenfield smart industrial city. The move follows Aurangabad police commissioner Nikhil Gupta being promoted to the rank of additional director general of police and the state home department elevating the Aurangabad police commissionerate from special IG rank to ADG and retaining Gupta as the police commissioner. DG office on Monday sent a letter to the Aurangabad CP’s office — with directives to revert on the same day with specific details, including the amount required for a makeshift police station or a rented premises till the construction of a permanent police station at MIDC Shendra is done. The letter, signed by assistant inspector general of police Ramesh Dhumal (planning and coordination department), has also sought the grade of the proposed police station (metro-A, city-B, or rural-C) and its temporary location.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/chikalthana-ps-parts-of-karmad-ps-to-be-merged-to-form-midc-shendra-ps/articleshow/86208956.cms||Mohammed Akhef

They also demanded an investigation into the Rs 20 crore development work of the national memorial. Members of Jallianwala Bagh Freedom Fighters Federation, Desh Bhagat Yadgar Committee, Bhartiya Kisan Union Ekta Ugrahn and AAP leaders, who took part in the protest, said that places like Jallianwala Bagh were never renovated but preserved. Leader of Mass Organisations of Amritsar, Rattan Singh Randhawa said they had written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday, stating that changes affected in its layout had divested the Jallianwala Bagh of its historical heritage. Regarding murals on both walls of the alleyway, he said they reminded one of festival and not of a place where more than two thousand Indians were massacred by the British army. BKU Ekta Ugrahan’s Balwinder Singh Mahal said, “The government has distorted the historical place, which was an unpardonable offense.” Senior Akali leader and former Punjab minister Bikram Singh Majithia alleged that the recent renovation done in the name of restoration allegedly at the behest of the Centre government had given the memorial a marriage palace look. “This blunder should be set right.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/protest-against-renovation-of-monument-to-jallianwala-bagh-massacre/articleshow/86213543.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Will not spare troublemakers: Gujarat high court||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Tuesday said that it will not spare anyone who is creating trouble in respect to the pollution of the Sabarmati. The court told the civic body that if it starts taking action against the polluters, it will create a warlike situation, but it should press on in the public interest. During the hearing of a suo motu PIL on river pollution caused by the improper treatment of sewage at the Pirana STP (sewage treatment plant), the bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice V D Nanavati asked the AMC to take stringent action against the polluters. The court especially mentioned the industrial units which discharge untreated effluents into gutters. The judges said: “We will try to make some difference. We will not spare anyone who is creating trouble.” The bench told the AMC: “Once you decide to take appropriate steps, it is going to be a warlike situation.” It added: “But for the good of the people and for the sake of environment, you will have to make a decision, whoever the industry owners may be, whoever that person may be.” The court went on to say: “You need to identify all these industries, find out who these people are and initiate steps.” The court once again sought the AMC’s plan to put an end to the problem of pollution and asserted that its directions must not remain on paper. The court said that it will pass a short interim order. It inquired whether the civic body plans to upgrade the sewage treatment plant, which has been affected by trade effluents. “The first thing that we need to do is to ensure that all such connections [discharging industrial effluents into sewer] are snapped,” the court said. “Take strictest of actions against these erring industries…initiating criminal prosecution, whatever it be. Once you take care of this, the sewage treatment plant might start working properly.” The judges said this after the AMC’s counsel submitted that there is a Rs 600 crore budget for upgrading the city’s STPs and Rs 140 crore for the Pirana STP. The judges told the AMC counsel again: “Your client will have to displease a huge mass of society, but in larger public interest you will have to do it. We want the AMC and Gujarat Pollution Control Board to do it.” The HC assumed a strict position after the amicus curiae in this case, advocate Hemang Shah, submitted his report. He showed the court that pollution levels were much higher than permissible limits. The court perused the photographs placed by Shah and made several suggestions to immediately stop polluting activities. Shah pointed to farming activities by Miroli Piyat Sahakari Mandali, which draws sewage water for irrigation. “People feel that the industrial effluent serves well as fertilizer,” he submitted and demanded that the cooperative and the district collector be joined as party respondents in the litigation. The court has posted further hearing on September 23.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/will-not-spare-troublemakers-hc/articleshow/86215707.cms||---

---||Pune||Pune: Baner-Pashan Link Road residents flag frequent power disruptions||PUNE: Residents of Baner Pashan Link Road (BPLR) claimed that they had been facing a series of power failures over the past two months. In the first 10 days of September, there have been at least four power disruptions ranging from 10 minutes to three hours, residents said. Members of housing societies in the area said the frequent power failures are causing serious disruptions as many people are working from home and children have online classes. Rajendra Chutar, president of the Baner Pashan Link Road Welfare Trust, said officials blame “technical problems” for the power disruptions. “Sometimes they say the problem is at the NCL substation, other times it is near one of the societies. How are we talking about smart cities if this is the situation,” said Chutar. Residents say they have prepared a log of all the power-related disruptions and already visited the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited last week to request officials to survey the area. According to the log, there have been 50 incidents of power failure in the past two months. An MSEDCL official said last week that residents met him following which power staff carried out maintenance work. “Almost 90% of the work is done and the remaining will be completed in two days. Problems arise due to moisture getting trapped in various electrical lines and boxes. All our cables are underground. As societies get old, the wiring also ages due to which insulation becomes weak leading to moisture which causes power failures,” said the official. According to resident Manish Mishra, the MSEDCL should consider buying high-quality cables and durable equipment. “Moisture cannot always be a reason, especially since Pune gets heavy rainfall,” said Mishra. The area also houses retirement home Athashri, where power outages cause serious problems for senior citizens. Former society president Hari Sundaresh said the average age of most residents is above 80. “Uninterrupted power supply is essential for washing clothes, heating food and ensuring hot water. There is a generator backup for lifts and lighting of common facilities but a permanent solution is required,” said Sundaresh. He also sought to know why the MSEDCL hasn’t invested in good insulation for its power utilities if it claims moisture is the problem for the outages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/baner-pashan-link-road-residents-flag-frequent-power-disruptions/articleshow/86213555.cms||Ardhra Nair

And it so happened early on Tuesday morning, when the premium train heading from Vadodara to Mumbai was left cooling its wheels for about 25 minutes en route when an injured eight-feet-long crocodile’s life lay literally sprawled on the track! It also brought a bevy of other trains running on the Vadodara-Mumbai line to a halt for nearly 45 minutes. However, despite best efforts by railway officials as well as animal activists, the gigantic male reptile couldn’t survive the hit it had taken on its head. “I got a call at about 3.15 am from the station superintendent of Karjan railway station that a crocodile was lying on the rail track.  It was spotted by a railway patrolman about five kilometres from Karjan Miyagam railway station. I left for the spot immediately with animal activist Neha Patel in our vehicle,” said Hemant Vadhwana, a wildlife activist. “But as the spot was located in the middle of nowhere and reaching there quickly was not possible at all. However, after our vehicle reached till Karjan railway station, we were pleasantly surprised to know that railway officials had halted Rajdhani express for about 20 minutes to help us board it and reach the exact spot, where the premium train stopped for another five minutes,” Vadhwana told TOI. “The railway staff that was present there said that the reptile was moving its jaw for a while. We examined it and found that it had severe injuries on its head. Sadly, it died within a few minutes. The reptile was run over by some speeding train,” said Neha Patel of Agniveer Pranin Foundation. The crocodile was then shifted to safety to allow train movement on this busy track. “Rajdhani is our premium train so we never delay it. But early on Tuesday morning, we kept the train on hold to help the rescuers reach the spot to save the crocodile’s life. Unfortunately, the reptile died of injuries,” said Santosh Kumar, station superintendent, Karjan Miyagam. “We took the dead reptile in Kisan train and handed it over to the forest department at Karjan railway station,” Patel added. Three more crocs rescuedOn Monday night, three more crocodiles were rescued by the wildlife activists from different areas. A four-feet-long crocodile was rescued from a village near Tarsali by Wildlife Rescue Trust volunteers. Another wildlife activist Hemant Vadhwana rescued a two-feet-long crocodile from the science faculty in MS University. It had ventured out of a drain nearby. A five-feet-long crocodile was also rescued by Vadhwana from Kotambi village in Halol.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/injured-croc-keeps-rajdhani-cooling-its-wheels-on-track-for-25-minutes/articleshow/86211121.cms||Tushar Tere
---||Raipur||Eight killed in 2013 Chhattisgarh firing weren’t Maoists: Probe report||RAIPUR: In yet another indictment of security forces in Maoist-hit Bastar, a judicial commission which probed the killing of eight people in Edesmetta village in 2013, has concluded that none of the slain was a Maoist, as claimed at the time of the firing. The forces might have opened fire in panic and ended up killing one of their own as well, said the panel. The one-man commission, headed by Justice V K Agrawal, a retired judge of Madhya Pradesh HC, submitted its report to the state government last week. A government spokesman said it is likely to be tabled in the next assembly session. The firing took place on the intervening night of May 17-18, 2013, in Edesmetta, a forest village, around 30km from Bijapur district headquarters and 440km south of Raipur. A group of local tribals had gathred to celebrate the Beej Pandum festival when 1,000-odd security personnel showed up and began firing. Eight people were killed. The CRPF's CoBRA initially claimed it had busted a Maoist hideout and that it had retaliated after it was fired upon by Maoists. According to sources, the judicial commission has observed that the forces may have fired in panic and the incident could have been avoided had there been better field intelligence. The commission also noted that a CoBRA constable Dev Prakash was killed by friendly fire and not by Maoist bullets, indicating that the muzzle-loading guns police claimed to have seized from the spot were not used to fire at him, said sources. The commission also doubts the seizure of weapons from the spot, noting that none of those was sent to the forensic lab. The Edesmetta judicial commission report is the second inquiry to indict security forces in Bastar for loss of civilian life. A judicial commission that probed the Sarkeguda encounter in which 17 people were killed in 2012, had concluded that the forces had opened fire "unilaterally, without any provocation".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/raipur/8-killed-in-2013-crpf-firing-werent-reds-probe-report/articleshow/86217773.cms||---

Deputy commissioner K V Rajendra said nearly 500 vaccination sites will be set up for the vaccination drive in the district. Of the total vaccines, 40,000 vaccines will be administered in the Mangaluru City Corporation (MCC) limits. More than 70% of the target population in the district have received at least the first dose of vaccines. As on date, nearly 50,000 people in the district are waiting for the second dose of vaccine. Panchayat development officers (PDO) have been directed to prepare a list of beneficiaries, who are yet to be given vaccines. Though the positivity rate in Dakshina Kannada has declined, the government is considering the district as a high-priority region, and planned a mega vaccination drive, he said. If the district faces a shortage of health staff, private hospitals will be roped in to carry out the mega drive. The district administration will identify a few private hospitals to conduct the free vaccination drive, and provide vaccines and syringes to them. The district will also make arrangements for the vaccination at doorsteps, exclusively for the vulnerable people in rural areas and border villages, he added. Covid-19 cases in DK falls to five months low After more than five months, the number of Covid-19 cases in Dakshina Kannada fell below the 100 mark on Tuesday. The district reported 87 positive cases with a very low test positivity rate of 0.8%. While the district reported five fatalities, the death toll increased to 1,623. The district has 1,576 active cases.

---||Delhi||Green push: South Delhi civic body to set up 35 e-charging and battery swapping stations for scooters||NEW DELHI: Starting next month, residents and other commuters in south Delhi can for the first time access e-charging and battery swapping stations for their two-wheelers. In a push to e-scooters, South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) has engaged Telecommunications Consultants India Limited (TCIL) for setting up 35 e-charging stations in the next four months. It will also install 10 four-wheeler charging stations. “The sites have been finalised and we aim to inaugurate some of these eco-friendly stations for two-wheelers on October 2,” said Sanjeev Kumar, chairman and managing director of TCIL. “We are expecting more people to use electric two-wheelers than four-wheelers in future,” he added. TimesViewE-charging stations are essential infrastructure for vehicles running on electricity. This is a good initiative to encourage two-wheelers in that direction. However, many more such stations need to be set up for the e-movement to really catch on.Electric two-wheelers are not only eco-friendly but also occupy less space and travel 80-100km after a full charge that consumes eight units of electricity, said an SDMC official. Electric four-wheelers consume 20 units to travel 100km and SDMC has already set up 21 e-charging stations for these vehicles. “As per a study of Delhi Pollution Control Committee and Phase II of Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicle scheme of the Centre, two-wheelers contribute to the two-third of the vehicular pollution in cities. That’s why we are creating separate points for charging two-wheelers, particularly on roadsides,” said Prem Shankar Jha, deputy commissioner of SDMC’s remunerative and project cell. “Our stations will be on Ring Road or Outer Ring Road to encourage their use for last-mile connectivity too.” After the Centre’s decision on a major rebate for electric two-wheelers, the sales are likely to jump, said Jha. These stations can also be used to charge three-wheelers, he added. TCIL will be responsible for installation, maintenance and operation of the e-charging and battery swapping stations. Each station for two-wheelers will have space for charging at least four two-wheelers at a time. “The PSU will get space equivalent to three cars (37.5sqm) for running each facility and, in lieu of the land, it will share revenue at Re 1 per KWh with SDMC,” said Col (retd) B K Oberoi, standing committee chairman. If it needs more space at any station, Rs 2,000 will be charged monthly per extra space, he added. “Though each charging point can run on 3.5kW load, we will also install pole-mounted distribution transformers of 100kW each for uninterrupted power supply,” said the SDMC official. The smart stations will have solar panels and can also run on solar energy. Arrangements for drinking water and free Wi-Fi for a specified period will be made to help people wait for an hour during charging. All stations will also have a charger management system, a meter box, LED screens, CCTV cameras and a battery swapping system, said Atul Kumar, executive director (civil) of TCIL. To get bulk users, TCIL will approach service providers in the e-commerce industry who depend on two-wheelers, said Sanjeev Kumar. “As they need to cover shorter distances, e-vehicles will be more economical for them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/green-push-sdmc-to-set-up-35-e-charging-and-battery-swapping-stations-for-scooters/articleshow/86213608.cms||Vibha Sharma

Health minister Veena George, however, said that the Ward 9 of Chathamangalam panchayat where the house of the 12-year-old boy who died of Nipah on September 5 is located, will continue to be a containment zone. In other areas which were part of the containment zone, shops will be allowed to function and people will be allowed to travel. However, those who have symptoms should remain inside houses. If anyone experiences any health issues, they should contact health workers immediately, she said. The decision was taken following the recommendation of the medical board and expert committee. The entire Chathamangalam panchayat along with areas of Mukkam municipality and Kodiyathur panchayat coming under the 3km radius around the house of the deceased boy at Pazhoor were declared as containment zone by Kozhikode district collector on September 5. Veena said that the Covid vaccination which had been suspended in the containment zone will resume on Wednesday. An action plan will be prepared for the conduct of vaccination drive by identifying those who are to get the Covid jabs. However, those with any symptoms should not come to take vaccination. There are as many as 9,593 people in the containment wards who are to take their first dose Covid vaccination. They will be administered vaccines in batches of 500 or 1,000 in separate sessions. Meanwhile, three more contacts of the boy have tested negative in the tests conducted at National Institute of Virology, Pune. With this, a total of 143 contacts have tested negative so far.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/curbs-lifted-in-nipah-containment-zones/articleshow/86211150.cms||---
---||Business||Laurus Labs and partners to develop pediatric HIV drug||Hyderabad: City-based pharma player Laurus Labs on Tuesday announced that it has entered into an agreement to accelerate the development of second and third-line HIV medication — darunavir boosted with ritonavir (DRV/r) —for children in association with Unitaid and the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI). Despite being available in high-income countries for over a 15-year period, a generic, fixed-dose combination pediatric version of DRV/r is still not available. Through this agreement, the partners are working towards filling this gap. The second-and third-line therapies are critical for children living with HIV/AIDS (CLHIV) where the World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended first-line treatment dolutegravir (DTG) may not be an option due to medication resistance or intolerance. Currently available second- and third-line treatments are often difficult for children to take due to bitter taste and difficult forms of administration. “A pediatric version of DRV/r has been a global health priority since 2013, but is still not available, leaving thousands of children without the lifesaving medication they need,” said Ann Veneman, interim co-CEO of CHAI.

Punjab is already facing several major challenges as it is a border state, where the hostile neighbour was continuously indulged in smuggling of arms and other contrabands. Amid such crucial circumstances, the treatment being meted out by Centre could become more precarious for the state,” said Tewari while addressing a press conference here on Tuesday. He claimed that the Punjab government led by chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh effectively tackled all the challenges, including the management of Covid-19 pandemic and was also the first to raise a voice against three black farm laws besides rejecting these in Punjab assembly. “Amarinder Singh is the real sympathiser of Punjab and people should retain the Congress in 2022,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/centre-treatment-to-punjab-step-motherly-says-tewari/articleshow/86213577.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Trough after low pressure prolongs wet spell||Kolkata: The city was drenched by heavy showers on Tuesday that were triggered by a sudden and unpredicted movement of the monsoon trough from the Bay of Bengal to Gangetic Bengal. Along with Kolkata, the neighbouring districts of South 24 Parganas and North 24 Parganas, Howrah and Hoogly, too, were hit by repeated spells of torrential rain that continued through the day. The rain may continue in Kolkata for the next 48 hours, said Met office, though it is likely to be moderate. A day after intermittent showers lashed Kolkata on Monday — under the impact of a deep depression over Bay of Bengal that moved towards Odisha and central India — heavy showers struck Kolkata early on Tuesday, taking even weathermen by surprise. “While we had expected the rain to lose intensity by Tuesday afternoon since the depression had moved away from Kolkata, the monsoon trough, that was stationed across Bay of Bengal, suddenly surged upwards towards south Bengal. It carried a huge mass of cloud with it that triggered intense showers in Kolkata and its surrounding districts,” said Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) director GK Das. With the depression moving away from the state, a ‘pressure gradient’ had been created that pulled the monsoon trough towards south Bengal, added Das. “Now that the depression has moved further away and lost strength, the gradient, too, will wane and the trough will trigger light to moderate rain,” explained Das. The monsoon trough, though, will continue to pass through south Bengal.  “The system had started moving away from Bengal towards Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh on Monday. So, it was expected to lose intensity. But the monsoon trough sprung a surprise,” said Das. Another low-pressure may form over Bay of Bengal around September 19 but it was too early to predict its intensity, said the Met office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/trough-after-low-pressure-prolongs-wet-spell/articleshow/86211194.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

The court, on the other hand, has asked the state government to consider their demands and take necessary decisions in eight weeks. A division bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice S Kumar said the sanitation workers would resume their duties immediately. In the meantime, the state government should take the decision on their 12-point charter of demands within eight weeks as per the undertaking received from the advocate general representing the state government. “Let the decision taken by the state government on the demands of the employees be placed through an affidavit of the principal secretary, Urban Development and Housing Department, Government of Bihar,” the court ordered while hearing the joint petition on Tuesday. The next hearing will be held on October 21. Advocate general Lalit Kishore stated that the issues highlighted by the sanitation workers and their unions shall be dealt with and decision taken, as per law, positively within eight weeks from Tuesday. He further stated that before taking any final decision, opportunity of hearing shall be afforded to the representatives of the employees and their union in the application. Senior counsel Yogesh Chandra Verma, representing the union of sanitation workers, highlighted their grievances which prompt them to go on an indefinite strike. He said the state government may consider releasing certain payments which undisputedly are due and admissible to the employees. Learning about the dues, the court said there was no reason as to why the employees must not get their dues within time. Further, the division bench directed that dues which are undisputedly admissible and payable must be released to the employees as early as possible, but not later than one week. Verma also said the state government should not proceed with the policy of outsourcing. On this, the court said none can have any grievance with the policy decision of the state government unless, of course, it is manifestly arbitrary or illegal. “It is always open to judicial scrutiny in an appropriate proceeding. However, we clarify that till such time the decision is taken by the state government on the employees’ representation, their services shall not be dispensed with,” the judges remarked. The senior counsel also pointed out that during the strike, the state government has taken disciplinary action against 200 employees and services of majority of such employees stand dispensed with. The advocate general, however, told this newspaper that the court has ordered that if the employees were removed simply because of strike, then their services will be restored by the employer/the municipal body/state government. “However, if such employees had indulged in penal or criminal offence or vandalised the property, then they will face the disciplinary action as per the court’s order on my submission,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/sanitation-workers-to-end-stir-on-hc-order/articleshow/86211188.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Lucknow||150 illegal slaughter houses closed in 4 years: UP govt||LUCKNOW: The UP government has ensured closure of 150 illegal slaughter houses in the state after coming to power in March 2017. It has also identified 356 mafia elements involved in the cattle smuggling, said a government spokesperson here on Monday. Hitting out at the previous Samajwadi Party government for allowing cattle smuggling to flourish in UP, the spokesperson said that currently only 35 slaughter houses are operational in the state. Besides, the government has initiated legal action against 1,823 criminals involved in the cattle smuggling and has confiscated assets worth over Rs 18 crore of 68 cattle smugglers who were booked under the UP Gangster and Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act. The spokesperson said that cow smuggling has always been a sensitive issue in UP and has led to several incidents of violence. The previous SP government had overlooked the functioning of slaughter houses which were flouting rules openly, he said. “In the SP regime everyone seeking to open a slaughter house used to get permission and nobody was concerned with ensuring that he should adhere to rules and regulations. But the situation changed after Yogi Adityanath took over as the UP CM. He has successfully ensured implementation of the Supreme Court’s order and the Centre’s guidelines in this regard,” he said. The UP police data shows that 319 cow smugglers have been arrested in the past 4.5 years, while properties of two have been attached and 14 booked under the National Security Act. Another 280 have been charged under Gangster’s Act and 114 under Goonda Act. Meanwhile, in an adoption programme for destitute cows under which the government gives an allowance of Rs 900 per month to farmers for looking after a stray cow, more than 83,200 cows have been given to 43,168 people till July 2021. There are 5,278 permanent cow shelters in the state which house about 5,86,793 cows. The Municipal Bodies Act was also amended in 2018, freeing municipal bodies from the responsibility of building and running government slaughter houses. Now, anyone can run a slaughter house with the permission of a state level committee of the urban development department, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/150-illegal-slaughter-houses-closed-in-four-years-up-govt/articleshow/86215714.cms||---
---||Delhi||Practical return: Delhi University reopens from today||NEW DELHI: Starting Wednesday, Delhi University will reopen after a long Covid layoff for final year students for courses that require practical work. The colleges are unsure of how many students will turn up, but they have been collecting data on their vaccination status and the mode of transport they will probably use to reach the campus. As per the notification issued by the university, students will be required to have had at least one dose of vaccine to be able to attend the practical classes and to get hostel accommodation. The guidelines for resumption of practical classes set a limit of 50% capacity at any one time. This means that only a limited number of experiments and exercises considered crucial are likely to be conducted. SP Agarwal, principal of Ramanujan College, said, “We are opening the laboratories for practical classes for final year students. The library facility for final year students has been opened. The teachers have been instructed about Covid protocol for students. We have also communicated to students other than final year ones that they must inform the college before coming to the campus.” While the teachers have been told that they can hold physical classes, Agarwal added, “How many students actually come for the practicals, we will only know tomorrow.” At Rajdhani College, the authorities have circulated Google forms and asked students to fill in details on their vaccination status, the mode of transportation they will use and their parents’ consent for them to return to college. The college mostly expects students undertaking chemistry, physics, computer science, mathematics Honours and the BSc programme courses. Rajesh Giri, principal of the college, said, “Around 300 students have responded and filled the forms. How many actually return will be clear in the coming days. At the college level, our Covid task force is at high alert. We have ordered gloves and shoe covers for students. We have made provisions to have the labs sanitised after every two hours. Thermal scanning will also be done at the entry gate.” With 60% students in DU colleges from outside the city, college principals say it might be some time before the laboratories and classrooms are filled up again.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/practical-return-du-reopens-from-today/articleshow/86213644.cms||---

Police sources said that the girl, who lives in Makarpura, left her home when her father got angry and took away the tablet. When her father went out searching for her, he found her standing at a petrol pump near Akashwani. On seeing her father, the girl ran inside a building beside the petrol pump and went to its terrace. Her father, the building’s security guard, too went behind her. Meanwhile, the police control room and the fire brigade were informed about the incident. The girl’s father and others managed to convince the girl to not take any extreme step and brought her down safely. “Before our team and the fire brigade reached, the girl had been brought down. She was brought to the police station and counselled,” said a cop. The incident attracted a huge crowd of passersby and onlookers due to which the traffic slowed down for a while.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/girl-threatens-suicide-after-father-takes-away-tablet/articleshow/86211230.cms||---
---||Delhi||Making demand for Hindu Rashtra doesn’t promote enmity, HC told||New Delhi: In a democratic setup, a demand for “Hindu Rashtra” does not amount to promoting enmity between religious groups, an accused in a case of alleged hate speech at an event at Jantar Mantar argued before Delhi High Court on Wednesday. Preet Singh, one of the organisers of the event who is at present in judicial custody, contended before Justice Mukta Gupta that he would not press his bail application if the court held a contrary opinion. “I say with the greatest sense of responsibility, if the court holds that the demand (of Hindu Rashtra) comes under Section 153 IPC, I will not press my bail application. In a democratic setup, if it (the demand) is promoting enmity, I will not press my bail,” Singh’s counsel submitted. “Nothing is said by my client, which attracts Section 153A IPC. They are putting a case of Section 34 IPC (common intention) but the event ended at 11.45 am and sloganeering happened at 3.45 pm. My client was not present at the time,” he stated, adding sloganeering was the genesis of the FIR. The court was also informed by the counsel that the main organiser, lawyer Ashwini Upadhyay, has already been granted bail. However, the prosecution opposed the plea, arguing that all the accused acted in concert and Singh’s absence at the time of chanting of allegedly communal slogans would not absolve him from any liability. “The main organiser and the accused gave a common interview and said statements (attracting) Section 153A IPC. Thereafter, a co-accused gave another interview. Another leads the chants and another uploads a Facebook live. All acted in furtherance of common intention,” police submitted, adding that all accused, except Upadhyay, were in custody and investigation in the case is ongoing. On September 3, the court had issued notice on Singh’s bail application and directed police to file its status report. On August 27, a sessions court had rejected his bail while noting that the right to assemble and freedom to air one’s thoughts are cherished under the Constitution, however, these are not absolute and have to be exercised with inherent reasonable restrictions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/making-demand-for-hindu-rashtra-doesnt-promote-enmity-hc-told/articleshow/86244447.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The mail, received by one of the CSL officials, threatened to cause an explosion of the fuel tanks at the shipyard. Following this, a thorough security inspection was held within the CSL premises but nothing suspicious was found. The new threat mail arrived even as the probe into the earlier received similar emails is yet to make any leads. The police are trying to trace the IP address of the previous email sender. Interestingly, the new mail was received by one of the five officials who received the threat emails earlier. CSL had lodged a complaint with Ernakulam South Police and a probe has been launched. However, CSL authorities refused to comment on the incident. Security has been beefed up at CSL, though the authorities suspect it to be some kind of hoax or prank, sources said. “The probe is going on. CSL’s security alert will continue to remain and police will provide all support to CISF, which is in charge of the shipyard’s security,” said a senior police officer of Kochi city police.tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/cochin-shipyard-gets-one-more-bomb-threat-via-email/articleshow/86211209.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: 3.5-hour operation to rescue woman with leg trapped in gully pit in New Town||KOLKATA: Two dozen fire brigade officials, 20 odd policemen, scores of civic personnel and some 50 odd local residents lent a helping hand to rescue a 65-year-old woman in New Town who was stranded in the middle of a road — her leg trapped in a drain cover — for three-and-a-half hours amidst the downpour on Tuesday. DLF New Town Heights resident Jayashree Roy Chowdhury was wading back home through the waterlogged stretch when her leg was caught between a concrete drain cover and the edge of the drain near Sukhabrishti in New Town. After her leg was finally pried out, Roy Chowdhury was taken to a Salt Lake hospital for treatment. She returned home later in the afternoon. “My mother-in-law is safe now. We are thoroughly indebted to the local residents and the administration who lent their support and ensured my mother-in-law never felt panicky,” Roy Chowdhury’s daughter-in-law told TOI.  After her leg was finally pried out, Roy Chowdhury was taken to a Salt Lake hospital for treatment. Roy Chowdhury had gone to the local market for some grocery shopping. She was walking back home around 11am wading through knee-deep water when she accidentally tripped on a wobbly drain cover and her right leg went down into the underground drain before the cover jammed again, trapping her leg. Witnesses said the woman screamed in pain as she fell in the water. Those near her had initially thought she had slipped and fell and tried to pull her up but realised her leg had got stuck somewhere. The complex security guards initially tried to pull her. Then two men tried to go down in the water and tried to push the drain cover to release her leg. But everyone failed. Cops were alerted and multiple officers tried to move the drain cover but failed as well. Fire Brigade officials reached the place and tried to move the drain cover first with bare hands and then with crowbars and chisels but failed again. “The woman started getting tense and sick sitting in the water with rain pouring heavily. All the neighbours were very protective as we took turns to hold an umbrella above her head and fed her from time to time,” said Kalyan Bose, one of the neighbours. As the clock ticked, senior administrative and police officials rushed to the spot. NKDA chairperson Debasis Sen was in touch with civic officials and New Town DCP Bishop Sarkar before three pumps were called in to flush out water but even that didn’t help. Finally, a separate group of firemen reached the place with gas cutters and drill machines and dismantled the drain cover to finally release her leg. Cops took her to a local hospital where she was administered first aid before they released her. The residents, however, were vocal about the poor condition of drainage in the area. NKDA chairperson Sen said he had instructed the PHE department to run a check on gully pits and drain covers in the entire NKDA area and take urgent precautionary actions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/3-5-hr-op-to-rescue-woman-with-leg-trapped-in-gully-pit/articleshow/86211166.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Reviewing the plan for promoting exports from the state on Tuesday, Singh said that 22 products are being exported to 19 countries. “We are adding 23 new products to this list and will promote exports to 31 more countries,” he added. Singh said the tariffs in apparel sector in some countries are less, which makes Indian products about 10% more expensive. “We have written to Union minister o Piyush Goyal, requesting for a reduction in tariffs and bringing them at par with Bangladesh, Cambodia etc., to make our exports competitive,” he said. The minister directed officials to analyse the export gaps in the last three years and devise a strategy to address the shortcomings immediately. “There is a need to create new ports for increasing exports. The government will set up its own testing labs for certification of products, besides a technology research cell. Exporters will be linked with UP Institute of Design to promote export of clothes,” he said. The government has increased payment for transportation of containers from production houses to ports from Rs 6,000 to Rs 12,000, while the air freight subsidy has been increased from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 5 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/govt-aims-to-double-ups-exports-to-rs-2-5l-cr-min/articleshow/86215734.cms||---

The panel submitted its report to speaker Rana K P Singh on Tuesday. Committee chairman Congress MLA Rana Gurjit Singh warned that groundwater table gets depleted by 70cm each year but is recharged, partly due to the pudding method of paddy sowing. The recommendations include rainwater harvesting for housing of 250 square yards or more and promotion of direct sowing of rice (DSR) technology in the state. Rana Gurjit also made a case for introduction of water credit scheme to encourage people to use less water. There are concerns that the state will turn into a desert in 25 years if the current reliance on the underground water is not stopped. The committee has incorporated suggestions by experts of the water resources department and Israel based Mekorot company. The Punjab government is already taking services of Israeli company for the checking the depleting groundwater table and replenishing the ground water.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/special-panel-proposes-steps-to-check-groundwater-depletion/articleshow/86213630.cms||---

According to the state health department data, of 944 dengue cases in the region between January and the first week of September this year, Nashik alone had 730 cases, the bulk of which are from the city area under the jurisdiction of the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC). Dhule is next with over 100 cases. Between January and the first week of September, one dengue death was reported from the rural areas of Ahmednagar district, which registered 52 cases in total. Even among chikungunya cases, Nashik registered the highest number of cases as compared with the other four districts. However, there have been no deaths due to chikungunya in North Maharashtra. The region has seen a rising trend of both dengue and chikungunya cases this year, when compared to the figures noted last year. In 2020, there were 614 dengue cases and 84 chikungunya cases. State health department officials said that residents as well as civic agencies must ensure that there is no stagnation of water, especially after rain. Both NMC’s medical superintendent Dr Bapusaheb Nagargoje and district civil surgeon Dr Ashok Thorat agreed that a higher number of cases has been reported in Nashik. “But there is nothing to be alarmed about as Nashik did not have any death,” they said. Nagargoje added that Nashik city’s population is at least 4-5 times more than the population of urban areas in other districts of the region and a parallel cannot be drawn between Nashik city and cities in other districts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-recorded-most-dengue-chikungunya-cases-in-n-maha/articleshow/86209068.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

The immersion process started post-sunset with several devotees thronging the immersion tanks and water bodies. The officials of the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC), health department workers, police personnel and volunteers of social organisations were deployed across the city to carry out the immersion procedure. The civic body had set up 160 artificial tanks across the city and near the water bodies for the convenience of residents looking to immerse the idols. In a bid to avoid crowding, the police department had requested people to avoid aarti at the immersion spots. People were told to perform all the rituals at their homes and then go to the immersion tanks. The police had barricaded the roads leading to the Panchaganga ghat and Rankala lake. As many as 2,500 police personnel were deployed to maintain law and order in the city. Citizens, meanwhile, responded to the KMC’s call to avoid immersion in water bodies like the Panchaganga river, Rankala lake, Kalamba lake, Kotitirth lake, Rajaram lake, etc. Idol donation was carried out on a large scale, as many preferred to donate their idols instead of immersing them — as a way to prevent water pollution. Satish Jadhav, an idol donor at Tambat Kaman near Rankala lake, said: “This is our fifth year of idol donation. We had a plaster-of-paris idol and, therefore, we donated it to the KMC team. They can immerse it at the Irani quarry which has been reserved for idol immersions.” Due to the Covid situation, most people who had clay idols, preferred to immerse the same at their homes. Vaibhav Raut, a resident of the Nagala Park area, said, “We did Bappa’s immersion in a bucket at our home to avoid going out into a crowd.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/eco-friendly-gauri-ganapati-idol-immersion-in-kolhapur/articleshow/86209082.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

The bursting of the dam led to the death of a 55-year-old woman and loss of cattle and property in large number. Several acres of farm were also destroyed and now the farmers from the downstream villages are left with no water for drinking and irrigation. “After the incident took place, I visitedthe spot and met the residents and farmers. Most of them claimed that the dam was leaking from several sections and the demand to get the leakages repaired was ignored by the authorities. Also, we found that the person deployed for security and safety was shifted to other place due to local political interference. We therefore demand that district collector Rahul Rekhawar initiates a thorough inquiry into the incident, reasons for it and book the officials responsible for the ignorance,” Patil said. Patil also demanded that the farmers should be granted Rs 1 lakh per acre to restore the farms damaged due to the sudden bursting of the dam. According to primary estimates, farm land over 250 hectare have been damaged due to the floods generated after the dam burst. The state government has already sought a detailed report of the incident. Bhudargad MLA Prakash Abitkar met chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and requested him to grant funds for rebuilding the dam as the farmers have to face severe shortage of water during summer. Abitkar said since the dam did not burst due to heavy or extremely heavy rains in short time span, the compensation cannot be granted as per National Disaster Response Fund rules. “Thus the CM has decided to extend all sorts of financial help to the affected residents going out of the way,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/chandrakant-patil-seeks-inquiry-into-megholi-dam-burst/articleshow/86209087.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Former Army officer gets relief from SC, gets Rs 88 lakh refund||Barinderjit.saluja Mohali: Giving relief to a former Army officer, the Supreme Court directed a realtor to pay him double the interest amounting to Rs 16.32 lakh. The realtor was asked to pay Rs 88 lakh, including the principal amount of Rs 72 lakh, for failing to deliver a house he bought in stipulated time. Retired Colonel T S Virdi booked a flat under the Army Welfare Housing Organisation (AWHO) project in Sector 114, Mohali, in May 2014. As demanded by AWHO, he paid the full cost of Rs 72 lakh by October 31, 2014. Colonel Virdi said he had to take a bank loan for this. The AWHO promised that possession of the flat would be handed over by December 2014. However, when possession was not given even till December 2016, he applied for withdrawal from the scheme and requested AWHO to refund the amount he had paid along with interest on the bank loan taken. Colonel Virdi said, “By May 2017, the AWHO refunded the principal amount, however, it refused to pay back the interest paid to the bank. To seek justice, I filed a case against AWHO in the Lok Adalat and the verdict was awarded in my favour. The Lok Adalat directed AWHO to pay complete interest paid to the bank along with costs. The court further directed that interest be added at the rate of 6% if payment was made within 45 days and at the rate of 15% if paid later. The AWHO appealed in Punjab and Haryana High Court against the lower court's decision but their appeal was dismissed.” Thereafter, Colonel Virdi said AWHO moved Supreme Court. “The Supreme Court also upheld the original verdict by passing an order in my favour and directed AWHO to pay interest at 15% (Rs 16.32 lakh) instead of 6% (Rs 7.84 lakh) as sought earlier,” he said. The amount was credited to the former Army officer on September 7, 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/former-army-officer-gets-relief-from-sc-gets-rs-88-lakh-refund/articleshow/86211231.cms||---
---||Lucknow||IIA members flag concerns before GST council meeting||Lucknow: Two days before Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman is scheduled to chair a meeting of the GST Council in Lucknow on September 16 and 17, the Indian Industries Association, representing small and medium industries, flagged off several concerns with the GST portal and highlighted issues with filing tax returns. Sanjay Kaul, chairperson, Banking and Taxation Committee of IIA, said that even though GST was implemented two years back, the GST portal remained inefficient and taxpayers faced a poor experience when filing returns or reconciling details. Detailing the specific issues which are being faced on the portal, Kaul said that even though the law was clear about GSTR 3B, the portal had not been synchronised for it. “Another problem relates to viewing invoices in B2B under GSTR 1. Only five invoices can be viewed at a time so if someone has to see 450 invoices of different GSTIN, then they have to click on the screen at least 90 times. Other than this, viewing beyond 500 invoices is not even possible,” he said. Kaul added that a limited log in time of 45 minutes is unnecessary as processes often take much longer and require multiple log-ins. The credit and cash ledgers can be viewed for only six months at one time while only three months of refund applications can be viewed at one go, Kaul said, making the process unnecessarily long. “An amendment in B2B and B2CS invoice is allowed only once while in export invoice it is allowed multiple times. Secondly, it takes 10 minutes for generate a GSTR-1 summary, irrespective of the number of invoices. The portal also allows for only 100 Kb space for uploading documents like index copy, sales deed, address proof etc. This should be increased to 5 MB,” Kaul said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/iia-members-flag-concerns-before-gst-council-meeting/articleshow/86215750.cms||Neha Lalchandani

---||Delhi||Northeast Delhi riots case: Court orders separate trials for accused of different faith||NEW DELHI: Citing a judicial precedent in Gujarat’s Godhra riot cases, a Delhi court separated the trial of three Hindus and two Muslims after framing of charges against them in a case related to the alleged murder of a 24-year-old man during the northeast Delhi riots. In the Godhra cases, Gujarat High Court had separated the trial of the people belonging to two different communities who were made accused in a common FIR. In the current case, additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav said it was appropriate to separate the trial of the accused persons belonging to two different communities so that their defence didn’t get prejudiced. After the accused pleaded not guilty to the charges framed against them and pleaded trial, the court noted that a “peculiar situation” had arisen as to whether the trial could be permitted to proceed “with an assortment of accused from different religions purportedly acting under two different conspiracies and unlawful assemblies”. The judge said this was definitely going to prejudice the defence of the accused persons from different religions. When a similar situation had arisen before a Gujarat court conducting the trial of Godhra riots, “the matter had been referred to Gujarat High Court in a criminal reference titled as ‘Additional sessions judge V State of Gujarat 2011…” Yadav said, adding that the high court authorised separation of trial. “Bearing in mind the aforesaid judicial precedent, this court also deems it appropriate to separate the trial of the accused persons so that their defence may not even likely to get prejudiced,” the judge said. He directed court staff to put up a separate sessions case number in the present FIR and said the existing chargesheet should be treated as the chargesheet for three accused, Kuldeep, Deepak Thakur and Deepak Yadav, while the other chargesheet would be treated as the chargesheet for Mohd Furkan and Mohd Irshad. The court further directed the DCP (Crime Branch) to furnish a complete set of chargesheet in the physical form to it within two weeks from Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ne-riots-case-court-orders-separate-trials-for-accused-of-different-faith/articleshow/86213725.cms||Usha Das
---||Chandigarh||Family seeks PM’s intervention to trace missing seafarer||Gurdaspur: Family members of seafarer Pankaj Kumar, 31, have sought Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s intervention in tracing him as his whereabouts are not known since September 6. The family claimed to have tried to approach the local MP Sunny Deol, but is yet to get any response from him. Talking to TOI on Tuesday, Pankaj’s younger brother Sandeep Kumar, a resident of Chaunta village in Dinanagar block of Gurdaspur district, said his brother was second engineer with the merchant vessel MV Tampen that set sailing from Cameroon to UAE with a total crew of 17 persons on August 26. He said before leaving for UAE, his brother told him that he would be in touch with them on the way wherever he could get mobile network. Sandeep further said on September 6, he received a call from the office of shipping company that while sailing from Cameroon to UAE, the ship was attacked by the pirates which left two crew members injured while there was no trace of his brother. “The cook of the vessel claims to have seen four to five persons pushing Pankaj to the other side,” he said, adding that it was not sure whether his brother was kidnapped by the pirates or not. “Since then I am knocking at every door whereever I could approach, but to no avail. Even our local MP Sunny Deol has not replied so far. I have now pinned my hopes on PM Modi to personally intervene in the matter,” Sandeep said. Pankaj had got married just two years back and was on a holiday at home. He had flown to Mumbai on January 29 on four-month contract with the shipping company which was extended as per the work requirement. Local human rights activist Sunil Dutt, who has taken up Pankaj’s case at various platforms, said he had also written to foreign minister S Jaishankar, apprising him of the complete incident and seeking his support to trace the whereabouts of Pankaj. “Unfortunately, the ministry of external affairs has not replied to any of my e-mail,” he said. Pankanj Joshi, personal assistant to Sunny Deol, said he had forwarded the matter to the ministry of external affairs and had also held a discussion with the person concerned who has assured to get back as soon as the ministry receives information about Pankaj.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/family-seeks-pms-intervention-to-trace-missing-seafarer/articleshow/86213683.cms||Yudhvir Rana

---||Nagpur||Melghat cyber cell gives a hard time to wildlife criminals||Nagpur: The wildlife crime cell (WCC) in Melghat is giving a tough time to criminals by tracking them from their hideouts. Till now, the cell has helped arrest over 175 criminals in 33-odd cases of poaching and trading of body parts of animals. The WCC is the only such cell in Maharashtra. The role of WCC, popularly called the cyber cell, has come a long way in cracking down on poachers and traders, especially dealing in tiger, leopard, and porcupine body parts in the recent past. “In the last two months, the Nagpur forest division officials have arrested over 30 criminals in the Tadoba and Pench tiger reserve landscapes and the role of cyber cell proved crucial by tracking their locations from call details. We could immediately nab at least six criminals in the last two tiger poaching cases,” said deputy conservator of forest (DyCF) Dr Bharat Singh Hada. “When I was posted in Satara, we had seized a leopard skin. Here, too, the Melghat cyber cell data proved to be of big help in nabbing the criminals. Besides, call details records (CDRs) are also acceptable documents in the court of law,” Hada added. Talking to TOI, Melghat CCF & field director Jayoti Banerjee says, “The WCC made a modest beginning in 2013 by nabbing hardcore tiger poachers from MP. Now it consists of a separate office equipped with cyber equipment and technology and a dedicated team which includes a DFO and six forest guards. It has two workstations, drone squads, a vehicle, cyber tool kit, laptops, and software of data analysis, etc.” “In 2013, a few criminal cases that the cyber cell initiated had long-reaching implications. There were many gangs from Madhya Pradesh involved in poaching tigers and smuggling their body parts to traders in Haryana, Delhi, and Punjab. This led to establishing international links to China and Tibet. Wildlife crime has a wide impact on society, ecology and the economy. It is the third-largest trade after drugs and arms,” says DFO Vishal Mali, Kolhapur (wildlife), who played a key role in streamlining the cyber cell in 2013. CCF Banerjee said the Melghat cyber cell deals in CDRs, subscriber detail record (SDRs), tower dump data, live tower location, internet protocol details record, interception, international mobile equipment identity (IMEI) surveillance etc. “The cell maintains a database of wildlife criminals and does a follow-up of court cases. We are in the process of creating a graded information network in Melghat which will provide secret information of poachers and smugglers in all important wildlife crime cases in Maharashtra,” Banerjee said. “Wildlife criminals have gone hi-tech with taking to online trading in a big way by displaying pictures of tiger nails and skin. Our team led by forester Akash Sarda and others crack such cases from IP addresses. The team has been trained by the Maharashtra Intelligence Academy (MIA), Pune. This training process is ongoing,” says Banerjee. Sarda says the cyber cell provides data based on a formal request from the division head on particular offences. Recently, several cases were cracked and criminals put behind bars. “Our team is also trained in fingerprint lifting and digitization of fingerprints. It has been provided legal training and has been given a legal toolkit which is used at the time of offences,” he said. Not only cracking wildlife crime, but the cyber cell also played a crucial role in detecting forest fires in 2019. The WCC is registered with NASA firms’ satellite which delivers real-time messages and a map to respective RFOs, DyCFs and field director on WhatsApp as well as wireless. GPS was installed in each vehicle and the teams were tracked. This led to an immediate response from the staff. ACTION IN LAST 1 YR * Cases cracked: 17 * Accused held: 69 * Seizure: A tiger skin, 30 claws, 5 canines, 10 leopard claws and canines, & bones, 18 sloth bear nails, 6 sambar horns, 1 gaur horn, 1 ivory tusk, 10 monitor lizard skin, 130 pangolin scales, 2 sand boa and 10 motorcycles||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/melghat-cyber-cell-gives-a-hard-time-to-wildlife-criminals/articleshow/86213730.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

Desai and Jadeja are currently in judicial custody for the alleged murder of the cop’s partner Sweety Patel and disposing of her body.The duo appealed against a lower court’s order of shifting them to the central jail in Vadodara city stating the lower court’s order is wrong and against the principles of law. In their application, Desai and Jadeja stated that the executive magistrate and jailer had stated that due to Covid-19 social distancing cannot be maintained, but the reason does not hold as they both are vaccinated. It was also argued that there is a possibility of a threat to Desai’s life in central jail as hardened criminals arrested by him in the past would also be there. “We submitted the copies of applications given by the complainant, executive magistrate and the investigating officer for their transfer to the central jail. We also argued that they had to be shifted since they have influential positions in Karjan and also due to administrative reasons for which they should not have any objection,” said district government pleader Anil Desai, who opposed the duo’s appeal along with assistant government pleader Ramesh Gianchandani. The court of additional sessions judge A A Nanavati upheld the arguments and took note of the investigating officer and executive magistrate’s apprehensions of Karjan sub-jail not being suitable for Desai and Jadeja.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/jail-transfer-application-of-suspended-cop-aide-rejected/articleshow/86211290.cms||---
---||India||After rape bid, UP drug addict killed national-level kho-kho player||BIJNOR: With the discovery of a rope, a shirt with two missing buttons and a slipper, police say they have solved the murder of the national-level kho kho player in Bijnor. A labourer who lives at Adampur village, 26, has been arrested for killing the woman, 24, after an attempt to rape her. Police said the man is addicted to smack, hash and alcohol. "Shahjad, who also goes by Khadim, is a labourer and has confessed to his crime. He is married and has a two-month-old daughter. He knew she always took the route by the railway tracks to get home - it was shorter," Bijnor SP Dharamveer Singh said at a press briefing. "On Friday, there was no work at the railway station. He took smack and was sitting by the pile of railway sleepers when the woman passed by around noon. In an attempt to rape her, he dragged her away. When she struggled, he panicked and strangled her with a rope. She died, he got scared and ran away." Police said he took her phone because she was on a call when he attacked her - her screams and cries for help were recorded in a chilling audio clip her friend later shared with the police. What police did go on was a rope they said they found at his house. It was not clear why he had the rope on him when the woman was passing by. Police added that they found a shirt with two missing buttons, which they believe was because of the struggle, and a slipper that matched one left at the spot. "There were injury marks on his body which he may have got during the struggle," the SP added. Shahjad's father Khaleel, meanwhile, said the injuries were from a fight Shahjad got into with his brother earlier. Khaleel sat in protest outside the Bijnor police station on Tuesday, demanding his release. The woman's father, too, was not convinced. He said that she was a sportsperson and could not have been overpowered by just one man - there must have been others as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/after-rape-bid-up-drug-addict-killed-national-level-kho-kho-player/articleshow/86217781.cms||---

The MC is conducting a drive to dismantle the green belt outside houses in Phase 3B1 and replace these with interlocking concrete tiles, that too without giving prior notice to residents or taking their consent. Angered residents staged a protest outside House number 2 to stop the entry of a JCB in the sector. The protesters included N S Kohli, Captain Jasbir Singh Grewal, Bir, Arvinder Puri, Sohi, Viran Jain, Kanwaljit Kaur, retired Colonel Sangha, Harjit Benewal, Sahni, Rocky, Simmi Kaur, Om Prakash, Sarabjeet Singh Kamboj, Mann Sachar, R P Singh and others. Kohli said, “The area councillor is spoiling the flora and fauna outside our houses by removing green cover and fixing concrete paver blocks. There is no need to do all this. It will not only spoil the environment but also waste public money. We need to stop this malpractice, which is purely in the vested interest of the councillor.” According to residents, the paver blocks hinder ground water recharge and threaten the environment. Mayor Amarjit Singh alias Jeeti Sidhu said, “There are no orders to remove all green spaces from outside houses. It was said that paver blocks must be fixed outside houses only if residents agree.” MC commissioner Kamal Kumar Garg, who was out of town, tried to sound a pacificatory note. “The matter was discussed in the recent F&CC meeting and the mayor was informed that fixing of paver blocks is illegal. He assured that the exercise will not be conducted,” Garg said. Under its previous policy of landscaping outside houses, Gmada did not allow fencing or hedge beyond one feet in height. All parks, green belts and green spaces outside houses have now been handed over to the MC, which has not adopted any policy to regulate green spaces outside houses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/councillors-bid-to-bulldoze-green-spaces-for-paver-blocks-riles-residents/articleshow/86211310.cms||Barinderjit Saluja
---||Mangaluru||Pvt PU college to conduct self-assessment test for its faculty||Mangaluru: A private college management in Mangaluru has decided to conduct a self-assessment test for faculty members. This is because teachers have been confined to online classes for the past one-and-a-half years due to the pandemic, and have not taught in a classroom environment for many months. “This assessment test will give an idea to each teaching faculty member where they stand, and what improvement is needed. The test is going to ascertain the academic knowledge of faculty members,” said the vice-chairperson of the foundation that runs the educational institution. It is conducted for the first time for the faculty of the college, and a few have already taken the test. The chairperson said that college faculty have not taught in a classroom environment, and were confined to their homes. The online classes were conducted using Power Point presentations and other modern teaching methods. “So self-assessment will do a SWOT analysis and point out strong and weak points,” said the vice-chairperson. A written test is included in the assessment. The faculty will also have to take a class, which will be watched remotely by an expert panel. The panel will assess the performance of the faculty, and they have to sit for an interview with the panel after the class. The exercise will be a private one, and its findings will not be published. Apart from it, the self-assessment will also help in promoting junior faculty to senior positions. “A faculty member who has less teaching experience, may have more capability than a senior faculty member. Some faculty become stagnant after a certain period in the teaching field. The test will help us to promote the junior faculty to take higher classes or coaching for competitive tests such as NEET, JEE or CET. This is an opportunity for every faculty member to know their capabilities in the teaching field,” said the vice-chairperson.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/pvt-pu-college-to-conduct-self-assessment-test-for-its-faculty/articleshow/86209187.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

Three bodies have been fished out so far. The victims have been identified as Narayanrao Matare (45), Ashwini Khandale (25), Vrushali Waghmare (19), Atulrao Waghnare (25), Vanshika Shivankar (2), Nisha Matare (22), Kiran Khandale (25), Aditi Khandale (13), Mohini Khandale (11), Piyush Matare (8) and Poonam Shivankar (26). The Matares from Wadgaon in Warud tehsil in Amravati had their relatives visiting them from different districts, like Nagpur and Wardha, to attend the 10th day ritual of Narayanrao's nephew who had passed away this month. Shyam Matare and Rajkumar Uikey were the two survivors of the episode who had managed to swum to safety despite a strong undercurrent of the Wardha river flowing fast due to incessant rain in the region for last few days. Bodies of Narayanrao, Vanshika and Kiran have been fished out so far. Vanshika's mother Poonam's bodies were among the ones which are yet to be recovered. Search operations by State disaster response force (SDRF) and National disaster response force (NDRF) and local divers would resume on Wednesday too. Narayanrao, who lost his daughters Kiran and Nisha, had offered a ride for the family members and relatives from his village Gadegaon to Zunj. Senior inspector MH Sarkate of Benoda police station said the boat could have safely used for four or five persons. "It was the overcrowding on a small boat which had led to the tragedy. The river is also flowing fast with steady currents due to heavy rains," he said. Local sources stated the Matare family and their relatives were clicking photos and selfie in the boat before it got capsized. "The boat was at a place in the river where it's surface is calm but the water is having currents underneath due to the waterfall in the vicinity," he said. The residents from the villages in the vicinity of Zunj, like Haturna, were alerted by the survivors who in turn alerted the police. Sub-divisional officer Nitin Hingole and Resident collector Nitin Vyawahare coordinated the rescue and search operations under collector Pawaneet Kaur and SP Hari Balaji.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/11-including-4-children-drown-in-wardha-river-boat-capsize/articleshow/86213623.cms||Soumitra Bose

---||Hyderabad||Telangana CM K Chandrasekhar Rao vows to get Covid-hit Metro back on track||HYDERABAD: Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Tuesday announced setting up of high-level committee to explore ways to extend support to Hyderabad Metro which has been hit hard financially by the pandemic. The state government’s assurance to support the project assumes significance against the backdrop of reports that L&T was planning to sell its equity to overcome huge losses. However, as per concessionaire agreement, it needed prior approval of government for disinvestment. The high-level committee comprises municipal, IT and industries minister KT Rama Rao, roads and buildings minister Vemula Prashanth Reddy, chief advisor Rajeev Sharma, chief secretary Somesh Kumar, principal secretary Narsing Rao, finance special chief secretary Ramakrishna Rao, municipal special chief secretary Arvind Kumar and industries principal secretary Jayesh Ranjan. The panel will also study avenues for future expansion to cater to the mass transport needs of a growing city. L&T officials, who met the CM at Pragathi Bhavan on Tuesday, sought the state’s support and submitted details of losses due to the pandemic, bank loans and accumulating interest on its borrowings to the chief minister’s office. Sources said L&T Metro Rail Hyderabad Ltd has suffered over Rs 1,700 crore losses during 2020-21 fiscal due to services remaining shut for nearly six months following Covid-19 outbreak. It has posted losses in current fiscal too due to decline in passenger base and limited operations during the second wave. “Mass transit projects such as Metro are essential for a growing city like Greater Hyderabad and it needs to be expanded to serve large sections of people and areas in future,” CM KCR said. “State government has been supporting various other sectors impacted by Covid-19 and will do its best to support Metro to get back on profit track,” the CM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cm-vows-to-get-covid-hit-metro-back-on-track/articleshow/86213745.cms||Roushan Ali

The company has initiated plans to take up land in the area allotted to Reliance Aerostructure Limited in the Mihan-SEZ for the two units catering to the defence sector. Dassaut Reliance Aerospace Limited (DRAL), which is a joint venture between Reliance and France’s Dassault, has its unit in the same area. DRAL is making aircraft components with plans to make an entire aircraft by 2022. There are plans to allot land parcels to other group companies—Reliance Defence Limited and Reliance Armaments Limited (RAL)—for setting up the night vision and small arms untis respectively. However, the projects are at a rather initial stage. The companies will have to take up the necessary approvals from the board of approvals (BoA) under the ministry of commerce for starting a unit in the SEZ. This includes an industrial licence needed for making defence equipment. The proposal by Reliance Defence Limited’s to grant the industrial licence for its plan for the night vision devices unit is expected to be coming up in the next BOA meeting this month. The matter was taken up in an earlier meeting of the BOA held in July. At that time the BOA had decided to defer the proposal, for getting clarity on the standard operating procedure for safeguards considering the sensitive nature of the activity. Directions have been issued for further examination of the safety measure with reference to the procedure followed by the Department for Promotion for Industry and Internal Trade. The BOA is a body under the ministry of commerce which approves the projects coming up in SEZs across the country it, on the basis of which the letter of approval is granted. A similar application has been mooted for the small arms factory by Reliance Armaments. There are plans to make rifles, pistols and similar small caliber weapons apart from having a testing facility. However, the matter is yet to be taken up by the BOA. An email sent by TOI to Reliance’ s corporate communications office went unanswered. At Nagpur, Reliance Aerostructure Limited has been allotted over 120 acres of land and also granted the co-developers status. This means it can further let out land to other entities. DRAL is one such unit. The allotment of land would take place after formalities related to approvals have ended.

The girl allegedly committed suicide on Sept 7 and police had initially registered a case of unnatural death. Police said she allegedly took the extreme step due to mental strain. It was found that the teacher was sending inappropriate messages to her on social media and this came to light after the father examined her phone and reported the matter at school. As the teacher had sent inappropriate messages, she would have been under mental strain after the issue was reported by her parents to the principal during a PTA meet. Following this, the principal had taken up the matter with the teacher, police said. Melparamba inspector Utham Das T said the messages were inappropriate to be sent to a 12-year-old student. He said the accused was also charged under Section 75 of the Juvenile Justice Act. Kerala State Commission for Protection of Child Rights registered a suo motu case and sought a report from Kasaragod district police chief, Bekal deputy SP, Melparamba SHO and district child protection officer before Oct 4.

---||Delhi||HC denies bail to two accused caught on cam holding stick, throwing stones at cops||New Delhi: Making a key distinction between those caught on video attacking police as part of a mob, and those who might be a “curious onlooker” or were only present at the site, the Delhi high court on Tuesday granted or rejected bail in a case relating to the alleged murder of Delhi Police head constable Ratan Lal during the northeast Delhi riots in 2020. It denied bail to two accused—Sadiq and Irshad Ali—after multiple CCTV footage clearly showed them holding a “danda” and pelting stones at the heavily outnumbered force. The high court added that the footage of the crime scene was “quite egregious” and sufficient to keep them in further custody since unlike others who got bail, the duo were “caught in an overt act that indicated their active participation in perpetrating the offences.” While denying bail to the two accused, the high court said there was “clinching evidence” to show the presence of Sadiq and Irshad, who are in custody since April 2020 and December 2020, respectively, at the scene of crime where they “participated with the mob and actively attacked the hopelessly outnumbered police force.” The high court underlined that “it is this clinching evidence that tilts this court to prolong the incarceration of the accused,” as “their presence in the video is clearly identified at the scene of crime, holding a danda in one hand and pelting stones with his other hand or provoking the crowd while attacking uniformed officials present around who were heavily and hopelessly outnumbered.” Justice Prasad highlighted that both the accused were “not merely a curious onlooker but actively participated in the attack against police which justifies the IPC charges slapped on them.” In contrast, the court found that in the case of Mohd Ayub and Shahnawaz, both in custody since March 2020, the prosecution failed to table electronic evidence to place them at the scene of crime as a part of the unlawful mob and there “cannot be an umbrella assumption of guilt.” “When there is a crowd involved, at the juncture of grant or denial of bail, the court must hesitate before arriving at the conclusion that every member of the unlawful assembly inhabits a common intention to accomplish the unlawful common object,” it said. The court also clarified that “merely being one of the organisers of the protest as well as being in touch with others who participated in the protest is also not sufficient enough to justify the prosecution’s stand that one of the accused who was granted bail was involved in the pre-planning of the alleged incident.” Five other accused have already been granted bail by the high court in this case earlier.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-denies-bail-to-two-accused-caught-on-cam-holding-stick-throwing-stones-at-cops/articleshow/86213810.cms||Abhinav Garg

Meanwhile, the region as a whole did not report noticeable extreme weather conditions during the past 36 hours, ending Tuesday evening, although the India Meteorological Department (IMD) had predicted very heavy to heavy rainfall in a few parts of Marathwada for two days from September 13. Among eight districts in the region, drought-prone Latur (727 mm) and Osmanabad (637 mm) districts have received 103% and 106% of normal rainfall annually during the stipulated four months of monsoon. Beed district (771 mm) is also considered as vulnerable to water-scarcity, but the region has already received surplus 136% of season’s showers. Among the remaining districts, Jalna (864 mm) leads in Marathwada in terms of rainfall activity having received surplus 143% of season’s showers, followed by Aurangabad (720 mm, 124%), Nanded (990 mm, 122%), Parbhani (903 mm, 119%) and Hingoli (885 mm, 111%), official data shows. KK Dakhore, agricultural meteorologist with Vasantrao Naik Marathwada Agricultural University in Parbhani, said there may be a break in the system that caused havoc during early September during the second half of the month. “As per official forecast, Marathwada is likely witness below average run of monsoon till September 25, which is likely to restore normalcy in many areas affected due to the recent incessant showers. The possible gradual weakening of weather systems over Bay of Bengal, among other areas, is expected to reduce the intensity of rainfall from September 19 to 25,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/marathwada-surpasses-seasons-rainfall-quota/articleshow/86209249.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Body goes missing from coach of Mumbai-UP train||MUMBAI: A family from Mumbai carrying the body of a relative to Prayagraj by train was in for a shock on Monday when it discovered on reaching the destination that the body had gone missing from the coffin that had been placed in the Mumbai-Varanasi Special Expresss ‘guard’ compartment. After a 12-hour search, the body was found 200km away, on the tracks near Maihar station in MP. However, questions about how it got out remain: the Railway Protection Force feels the coffin turned over in an empty compartment and the body fell off, while the family blames railways for negligence, and activists fear train robbers who ‘steal bodies’ might have been involved. The family said there were injury marks all over the body of Sarwari Shaikh, 56. Shaikh, from Pratapgarh in Prayagraj, suffered from cancer and had been under treatment at Tata Memorial Hospital from July. Woman’s family and undertakers say coffin was fitted with screwsA woman’s body went missing from a coffin on a train to Varanasi and was later found 200 km away. Sarwari Shaikh’s son, Gulfam Shaikh, who works in a loom in Bhiwandi, had in July brought her to the city. She was staying at a relative’s place in Dharavi and undergoing treatment at Tata Memorial Hospital. On Sunday morning she passed away. Her family members decided to take her body to their native place for the funeral and had engaged Tirumala Undertakers. The family submitted all the documents, including the death certificate, from BMC to transport the body by train. At 9 pm on Monday, when the family alighted at Prayagraj and went to claim the body from the ‘guard’ compartment-—which is in the front of a train, with guards stationed often at the back—they found the coffin lightweight and hence opened it. They immediately alerted the railway police about the missing body. Senior GRP officials visited the spot and sent a message to the main control room as well as to all the major railway stations where the train had halted. A complaint was lodged, and after nearly 25 railway stations and tracks along the route were examined, police found the body lying on the tracks near Maihar station, 202 km away. An RPF team took possession of the body at Maihar on Tuesday afternoon and handed it to the family in Prayagraj late evening. “As procedure, we adopted the method which prevents decomposition of a body for 24 to 30 hours and loaded it in the special express for Varanasi,” said an official from Tirumala. The railways blamed the family. “Bodies are normally carried in the front guard room and as per rules, one of the relatives has to be near it. In this case, neither any relative nor guard was present. We suspect that as the bogie was empty, the coffin may have moved and the body may have fallen off the train,” said the inspector of Maihar RPF who idenfitied himself only as Rawat. The family as well as Tirumala Undertakers rubbished the RPF’s claims. “We packed the body in the coffin with screws fitted in all corners, so there is no question of the body automatically falling off the moving train,” said an official from the undertakers. Activist Imran Khan from Wadala, who has taken up the cause of the family, said, “It is shocking railways have not taken cognisance of the incident. This is a case of mischief by some robber or a racket involved in stealing bodies, which RPF should investigate.” Ansar Ahmed, a relative of the family, said, “It has been a horrifying experience. We never thought the railways would be so careless.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/womans-family-and-undertakers-say-coffin-was-fitted-with-screws/articleshow/86215844.cms||Ahmed Ali

With arrears rising to over Rs 70,000 crore, Raut is reported to have discussed options of restructuring and recovering dues through outsourced agencies. Raut’s move has ruffled political feathers with former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis calling it ‘extortion’. On his arrival at the Nagpur airport on Tuesday, Fadnavis said, “Raut’s presentation clearly indicates the piled up pending dues in their tenure. But these dues also include the subsidy given for agriculture. The losses that we incur have to covered through tariff charged to consumers. But in this case, it is seems that ground is being prepared for forcibly recovering money from consumers.” The leader of the opposition also said that the government is not offering sops to those affected by the pandemic, but causing them inconvenience. “Due to Covid, be it a farmer or a commoner, this government only wants to forcibly recover dues. The groundwork is being done for this purpose,” said Fadnavis. In his presentation, Raut blamed the Fadnavis-led government for its inability to recover dues which led to the huge pile-up of arrears. Meanwhile, former energy minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule told TOI that they too had inherited a similar situation. “When we formed the government, over Rs 23,000 crore was due from various categories of consumers. Yet, we never resorted to forcible recovery of dues. On the contrary, we tried to provide solutions. We had the guts to provide sops to citizens and even managed the overall finances in a much better manner,” said Bawankule. He challenged the state government to make public balance sheets from all the financial years during his tenure as the department’s minister. “It will become clear on how well we managed our finances without every troubling the consumer,” said Bawankule. Raut did not respond to TOI’s calls or messages.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/energy-min-says-pending-dues-over-rs70000-crore/articleshow/86213812.cms||---

Even the condition of the other state or national highways connecting Nashik is not good. A large number of people travel by road to various parts around the district for work and business. They said that the condition of the roads was not good prior to the monsoon season and it has deteriorated after the heavy rainfall. Vijay Bhagat, resident of Ghoti, said that the Mumbai-Agra highway gets damaged every monsoon. “Commuting is difficult, especially for those riding bikes. It is an uphill task to negotiate the huge potholes on the highway. Many times the bikers fall due to the potholes near the Ghatan Devi temple section of the highway,” he said. Motorists said that when they pay the toll, they expect that the roads are in a good motorable condition. However, that is not the case with the Mumbai Agra highway. Motorists have also rued the condition of the Nashik-Pune highway near Sinnar Phata in Nashik Road. Mohan Diwane, a resident of Nashik Road, said that they are waiting for the problem with the road to be resolved for seven years but it has not happened. “The work of road widening is only getting delayed year after year,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/highways-around-nashik-in-poor-shape/articleshow/86209264.cms||Santosh Sonawane

As per the rank list released by Anna University here on Tuesday, J Nithyasree from Srirangam in Trichy and PL Uma Shwetha from Thirumayam in Pudukottai district also secured 200 marks and stood top in the list. Sarathivasan from Thuvakudi Malai in Trichy completed his schooling up to Class VII from Boiler Plant Higher Secondary School, a government-aided school. Then he shifted to Bangalore where his maternal uncles took care of his studies as his father Sathyamoorthi was a load man at BHEL on a temporary basis. “I studied classes VIII to X at St Philomena’s Higher Secondary School in Bangalore and scored 592 marks out of 625 in Class X. I completed secondary education at RNS Vidya Niketan PU College in Bangalore, with a score of 584 marks out of 600 in Class XII,” Sarathivasan said. With the meagre income, his father struggled to spend money for Sarathivasan and his elder brother S Santhosh. So, their maternal uncles, who are doing business in Bangalore took care of both. Sarathivasan is aspiring to pursue his engineering studies at the main campus of Anna University in Guindy. “I am thinking of opting BE computer science or BTech information technology. I wish to become a software developer and my dream is to become the CEO of a multi-national company,” he added. “Without the encouragement of my mother S Premalatha, he could not have attained this,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichy-boy-scores-200-to-top-tnea-rank-list/articleshow/86213815.cms||---

Babu along with the minister for municipal administration, K N Nehru, inspected the Samayapuram Mariamman temple premises and the swimming pool for elephant at Akilandeswari Jambukeswarar temple in Thiruvanaikovil in Trichy after completing his visit to Tiruchendhur. Earlier in the day, the minister inspected the works carried out by the department at the Subramaniya Swamy Temple in Tiruchendur in Tuticorin district. Talking to reporters at Tuticorin, he said that efforts will be taken to streamline tonsuring at the temples under HR&CE department to ensure that the barbers do not collect money from devotees. The minister said that ear piercing at these temples will also be streamlined.

---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Central Drug Research Institute achieves breakthrough in trial of Umifenovir in Covid-19 treatment||LUCKNOW: The Central Drug Research Institute (CDRI) on Tuesday claimed that the clinical trials of antiviral drug, Umifenovir, in treatment of Covid-19 have been successful. The trial of Umifenovir on 132 Covid-19 patients showed that, if proper dose is given twice daily for five days, the drug can effectively reduce viral load to zero in mild or moderate symptomatic and asymptomatic patients by checking multiplication of the virus. Titled ‘Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial of efficacy, safety and tolerability of antiviral drug Umifenovir vs standard care of therapy in non-severe Covid-19 patients’, the clinical trial was conducted at three institutions – KGMU, Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences (RMLIMS) and Era’s Lucknow Medical College and Hospital (ELMCH). “Since Umifenovir is a broad spectrum antiviral and is being used as a safe over-the-counter drug for influenza and pneumonia for over 20 years in Russia, China and other countries, the first two trials were not mandatory,” CDRI director Prof Tapas Kundu said. “CDRI, therefore, directly went for phase-III trial, which was conducted on 132 patients who were either admitted to hospitals or were in home quarantine under the supervision of these hospitals,” CDRI director Prof Tapas Kundu said. “In a study, double-blind mode improves reliability of results by preventing bias when doctors evaluate patients’ outcomes. The results showed that viral load in mild, moderate or asymptomatic patients after being given two doses of Umifenovir (800mg) twice a day, became zero in an average of five days. Patients did not experience any side-effects and their symptoms also did not turn severe,” he said. “Studies by CDRI in collaboration with CSIR-IMT, Chandigarh, also showed that Umifenovir exhibits good cell culture inhibition of SARS-Cov2, which suggests that the drug inhibits the entry of SARS-Cov2 virus into human cells,” Prof Kundu said. He said the institute was getting the dosage plan patented as it had not been used earlier for Covid-19. “The Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) has evaluated the clinical trials report and in view of the highly encouraging results, he has asked the team to continue the studies on more mild, asymptomatic patients for grant of emergency approval of the drug,” he added. Chief scientist, CDRI, Prof R Ravishankar, who led the team of scientists, said: “Umifenovir will be economical for treating Covid-19 patients as it is around 50-54% cheaper as compared to current medication. Expert from the three hospitals which were part of the study said the drug is safe for pregnant women and children. We are looking into the possibility of Umifenovir syrup for children and also in powder form so that it can be used as puff inhalers.” According to CDRI, the head of KGMU’s medicine department, Dr Virendra Atam, and medical superintendent, Dr Himanshu Reddy, who were principal investigators of the study at the university, mentioned in their report done for the study that faster recovery of coronavirus patients would reduce virus shedding and consequent spread of infection to others. It also said that the principal of Era’s Medical College, Prof MMA Faridi, mentioned in his report that Umifenovir could be prescribed to pregnant women and children, if approved by the authorities. Similarly, Prof Vikram Singh from RMLIMS suggested that as Umifenovir was safe, it had significant efficacy on mild and asymptomatic patients and could also be useful as a prophylactic for high-risk patients. CDRI spokesperson Sanjeev Yadav said, “Umifenovir was selected from 16 drugs suggested by the CSIR after looking into the feasibility of synthesis using locally available chemicals at the peak of pandemic. The DCGI then gave permission for trials in June last year.” A team of CDRI chemists, Ajay K Srivastava, Chandra Bhushan Tripathi, Nayan Ghosh and Nilanjana Majumdar, and their students, synthesized the drug and developed the process technology – chemical processing used to refine raw material into finished product – in record time. The technology was then transferred to a Goa-based private pharmaceutical company within a month’s time to make the “active pharmaceutical ingredient” (API) and tablets for trials. Finally, after securing ethical approvals and completing stability studies of the drug at CDRI, the team of researchers took consent of patients and roped them in for the study.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cdri-achieves-breakthrough-in-trial-of-umifenovir-in-covid-19-treatment/articleshow/86215841.cms||Mohita Tewari
---||Nagpur||OBC reservation: BJP to start protests from today||Nagpur: The BJP will start a series of agitations at different locations from Wednesday to protest against what they term is the state government’s failure to ensure political reservation for the OBC community. Senior BJP leader Chandrashekhar Bawankule, in the presence of all city and district party office bearers, informed the media that the agitations shall continue “till the OBC community gets justice”. Speaking to TOI, Bawankule said, “The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government itself has some leaders who are not interested in giving reservation to the OBCs. If one looks at the way the government has approached the issue on the legal front, it’s clear that things have not been done properly.” He said Congress’ state unit chief Nana Patole’s statement regarding the ‘suspicious’ role of attorney general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni is an indication of how poorly things are being managed. “Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray also handles the law department and how much time did he or the senior ministers spend in briefing the AG on how to proceed with the case in the Supreme Court. When our government was in power, the then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis held a meeting with the AG and other lawyers till 3am regarding what the state’s stand will be during the court hearing scheduled in the afternoon. Has Thackeray done anything similar?,” asked Bawankule. Leader of Opposition and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis too arrived in the city on Tuesday evening to take part in these agitations. Reacting to Patole’s statement that AG Kumbhakoni was appointed during the previous government’s tenure and still continues to hold the post, Fadnavis said it was an incorrect interpretation of facts. “Kumbhakoni was re-appointed by CM Thackeray as it’s his prerogative, and it was approved by the cabinet. So technically, Kumbhakoni has not continued from our tenure, as is being said,” said Fadnavis. On ZP bypolls being announced sans OBC reservation, Fadnavis said, “Now we will go ahead and face the electorate. But from this (no reservation) it has become clear that there is a big difference between what the state government says and what it actually does.” Congress’ Nagpur city chief and MLA Vikas Thakre, however, criticized the BJP for ‘politicizing’ the issue. “When the ball was in their court (till 2019), these people did nothing. And now they are trying to politicize the issue just because of the bypolls scheduled for next month,” said Thakre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/obc-reservation-bjp-to-start-protests-from-today/articleshow/86213834.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Zoos to reopen today after 5 months||KOLKATA: The zoos across the state, including the Alipore Zoological Gardens in Kolkata and Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park in Darjeeling, and deer parks will reopen on Wednesday after the Covid second-wave break. The establishments that were shut in March-end are reopening after a gap of more than five months, said a senior forest department official. Talking to TOI, member secretary of the state zoo authority, Sourav Chowdhury, confirmed receiving the order. “We will open the zoos on Wednesday with all Covid protocols in place,” he added. Alipore zoo director AK Samanta said that they would strictly follow all Covid guidelines. “People without masks will not be allowed entry. The arrangements have been made in such a way that visitors will have to pass through two sanitisation gates before reaching the ticket counters,” he added. After purchasing tickets, they will have to undergo thermal scanning before entering the zoo campus. On being asked if there is any special plan to manage the crowd, Samanta said: “During this time of the year, the daily footfall at the zoo hardly crosses 6,000. Given the area inside the zoo, this crowd will not be difficult to manage. If the crowd swells, we will think of taking special measures,” Samanta added. Markings have been made near the toilets, at the counters, on visitors’ pathways and in front of enclosures to make sure visitors follow social distancing. According to Samanta, they used anti-viral spray to clean the zoo premises a couple of days ago. Before the zoo opens its gates around 9am on Wednesday, the staff will again clean the campus and the enclosures. The zoo stays open till 5pm, but the last ticket is issued at 4.30pm. According to an official, they will also re-activate the online system to purchase tickets soon. Both Alipore and Darjeeling zoos have been live streaming videos of some animals, at least for two hours every day, allowing people to watch them live from their homes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/zoos-to-reopen-today/articleshow/86211429.cms||---

The JDA has mentioned that an appeal or writ may be filed by unknown persons as the issue is of Public Interest Litigation. Sources claimed that the JDA is being extra cautious as it plans to lay the foundation stone of state government’s ambitious project, Gandhi Darshan Museum and Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Governance and Social Sciences at Kanak Bhawan on October 2. Central Park Bachao Sangharsh Samiti president Yogesh Yadav said, the JDA is adamant to construct a Rs 100-crore museum project on the Central Park after violating all rules. Yadav said, “The land was acquired for the Central Park and government itself is keen to break the rules. With the connivance of JDA and UDH officials, two clubs are functioning, and public cannot enter on the land which they have encroached. The space is shrinking and rather than planning expansion, the JDA is developing projects on the park land, which can be utilized for public.” The JDA had taken possession of the hotel, Kanak Bhawan and a horse stable at Central Park spreading across nearly 35,000 square metre following a Supreme Court order on May 3, 2017. The JDA has decided to develop a museum as it claims the land has been earmarked as commercial/recreation in Master Plan 2025. However, activists and experts said that the park land cannot be utilised for any other purpose. Vimal Chaudhary, advocate counsel for Sangrash Samiti, said, “It is contempt of the court. In the order, it has been specifically given directions to the state government to utilise the land for purpose it was acquired. Since the land has been acquired for the park, it cannot be utilised it for any other purpose.” Under the Rajasthan State Land Acquisition Act, the Urban Improvement Trust (UIT) had acquired 322 bighas in the Rambagh Complex for public utilities in 1973. As per UIT claims, these two prime buildings were part of the ‘acquired’ land, following which possession was taken by the JDA in 2017 after a long legal battle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/gandhi-museum-row-govt-files-caveat-in-high-court/articleshow/86215846.cms||---
---||Goa||Now, pay state to reforest your land, help Goa battle climate change||PANAJI: Even as climate change is raising temperatures in Goa faster than in the rest of the country, the state has proposed a scheme by which individuals and institutions can help the government battle global warming by paying it to plant and care for trees on their land. Here’s how it works: The individual (or institution) pays the Goa state biodiversity board to reforest their vacant land with trees that are indigenous and useful. The board, on its part, will not only plant the trees but also care for them. If a sapling dies, it will be replaced. The costs depend on the type of land: For instance, the board will charge Rs 7,000 to plant a tree on rocky or plateau land and care for it for five years. In other areas, the price for the same service would be Rs 5,000. In doing this, the landowner contributes their share in the state’s battle against climate change. There are various incentives in the scheme, too. For instance, new saplings can commemorate the birth of a child, memorialise a departed person, mark an anniversary, or for institutions, celebrate an important milestone. The plan has its roots in the Mopa airport project, where the government engaged the Goa state biodiversity board to carry out reforestation of the land. Encouraged by the result, the board now framed the scheme offering its services to all. The saplings will be procured from either the forest department or local farmers and nurseries. Village biodiversity committees will also be involved, and some local voluntary organisations, schools and colleges may also be roped in. Those who wish to avail this service and sign the MoU with the board will be entitled to enjoy fruits and benefits from the trees. However, if the board itself takes up plantation activity with its village committees or in collaboration with the forest department, the benefits will be shared 50/50 by both. “Plantation is to be done in such a way that support should be provided for a period of the first five years. This plantation scheme is mainly to ensure the intensification of existing green cover with indigenous trees useful from the point of view of ecological and economic perspective,” the scheme states. “In case the applicant desires to plant more than ten trees in a phased manner, the payment may be allowed to be made in instalments, but the actual implementation will only start after receiving 100% of the advance payment,” the board said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/now-pay-state-to-reforest-your-land-help-goa-battle-climate-change/articleshow/86213873.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar
---||Goa||Covid-19 violations at Goa border, collector issues fresh directions||PANAJI: North Goa collector Ajit Roy on Tuesday admitted that Covid-19 protocols are not being followed at the Patradevi checkpost, and issued fresh directions asking authorities at the Goa-Maharashtra border to maintain a register with details of buses and passengers. The move came after a passenger who regularly travels by bus along the Goa-Pune-Goa route flagged blatant violations there. In a letter to Roy, he said that bus drivers and helpers collect money to permit entry to those who are neither fully vaccinated nor hold a Covid-negative certificate. The passenger, a Tiswadi resident, met Roy and submitted video recordings of his claim, after which Roy’s directive went out. “The video is not very clear, but this kind of problem could occur only with passenger vehicles," Roy said. "That’s why fresh instructions have been issued to all those deployed at the checkpost to ensure that each and every passenger travelling in passenger vehicles are checked.” The collector, however, added that “There is a good system and good arrangement in place at the border”. In the letter, the citizen noted, “The act was committed with such brazenness and (openly) that it surely seems that it is being done on a larger scale with many or all bus operators, and being done in connivance with police and other government officials posted there”. He told TOI that he witnessed the unlawful activities on two occasions — August 26 and September 10 — in broad daylight at the Patradevi border, and when it happened the second time, he decided to raise his voice. “Even doctors have lost their lives in the second wave. It is negligent and unlawful acts like these at the border that snowball and then go out of hand. In mid-March, the second wave attacked us unexpectedly, but we’ve not learnt a lesson. The government spends money, time and resources in treating people, but these precautionary measures must be put in place,” he said. He said he was “shocked” to witness the lax security and scrutiny, and requested that the matter be looked into on an “urgent basis”. “Such brazen non-compliance will only lead to an increase in cases in the expected third wave, and affect the local population,” he said. “I and Goa too have lost many innocent and good people to Covid-19,” he added. “It is not correct and not fair, especially when the government has SOPs in place. I was part of a local Covid care team, and I too had a Covid attack. I’m all praise for the healthcare workers looking after people, but here at the border, there is no seriousness about the disease,” he said. The few black sheep must be brought to task, he said, and requested the collector to ensure those who are involved in the activity are booked immediately. “Are government SOPs not strong enough to ensure proper checks at the border? Is there inadequate manpower? The collector assured me he will look into the issue,” he told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/covid-protocol-violations-at-goa-border-n-goa-collector-issues-fresh-instructions/articleshow/86213844.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: First Covid dose cover for frontline staff, 45+ just short of 100%||VISAKHAPATNAM: Andhra Pradesh crossed the 3.5 crore Covid-19 vaccine dose milestone on September 13. Nearly 1.08 crore people completed their two doses of vaccine inoculation, translating to full immunisation in about 28% of the total eligible beneficiaries. The national average is about 20%. On the other hand, the first dose coverage has exceeded 62% in the state against the national average of some 61%. The nationwide mass inoculation drive was launched on January 16 with a focus on protecting healthcare workers and frontline staff. In phase-II, it was extended to people aged 60 and above, and those within the age bracket of 45 to 59 years with co-morbidities. But even after the Union government widened the net to include people aged between 18 and 44 to the priority groups, Andrha Pradesh had deferred the vaccination for this cohort until it recently opened up the programme for the same group. As per the data available with TOI, the first dose coverage among healthcare workers (HCW) and frontline workers (FLW) is almost 99%. Interestingly, of the 1.33 crore eligible beneficiaries in the 45+ age group, 1.32 crore people have got at least one jab, equalling 99.6% coverage. The first dose vaccine coverage among the young cohort (18-44) is about 45%. The state health officials informed that as part of a three-day special drive, between September 11 and 13, Andhra Pradesh administered 28.63 lakh Covid-19 vaccine doses. During this drive, the state has also surpassed two milestones, including crossing the 3.5 crore vaccine dose mark as well vaccinating at least one crore people with two doses. Each district, on average, vaccinated about 2.5 lakh people in these three days. District collectors organised a meeting on a daily basis to review the vaccination progress during the special drive. Andhra Pradesh will receive nearly 1.05 crore Covid-19 vaccine doses in September under the Union government quota. The vaccination numbers at the private hospitals continued to be sluggish as these centres administered only some 6.88 lakh doses as of September 13 despite the allocation of more than 40 lakh doses since May.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/first-dose-cover-for-frontline-staff-45-just-short-of-100/articleshow/86211418.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

The Navaja backwaters of Koyna dam received record 139 mm rainfall during the same period. The India Meteorological Department classifies 15.6mm-64.4 mm rainfall as moderate, 64.5mm-115.5 mm rain as heavy, 115.6-204.4 mm as very heavy, over 204.5 mm as extremely heavy rain, and over 300 mm as exceptionally heavy rain The IMD has issued ‘Orange Alert’ for the ghat sections of both Kolhapur and Satara districts for Wednesday as well. These regions can expect more than 65 mm rainfall. The discharge from Koyna dam continues to be 50,000 cubic feet per second (cusec). The inflow has increased to 55,000 cusec. The discharge from Warna dam too has increased to 10,000 cusec. The dam is filled to its 100% capacity. The discharge from both Koyna and Warna dam is likely to be increased by Wednesday morning. The discharge from the dams and the heavy rainfall in the free-catchment areas has led to increase in water level of Krishna river from 16 feet to 19 feet since Monday evening. Sangli district collector Abhijeet Chaudhary said, “The danger mark of Krishna is 45 feet. We have alerted the residents residing along the river and have asked not to go near to the river. They have been asked to keep watch on the water level and be ready to shift if the river starts swelling further.” Despite the alert, many villagers went to the river to immerse Ganesh idols. The Sangli civic administration had put up the artificial ponds so that the citizens do not immerse idols in the river.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/heavy-rain-in-navaja-mbaleshwar-in-satara/articleshow/86209288.cms||---

In a counter move, the BJP is trying to invoke the self-respect of voters stating that the ruling party can buy the leaders but not the voters. Finance minister T Harish Rao, who has been leading the campaign for the ruling party, is telling the people that he was elected six times as an MLA from Siddipet constituency because he delivered every promise made to the voters. Likewise, every promise being made by him in Huzurabad will be implemented. “I stand guarantee for implementation of every promise. I will myself inaugurate 2BHK houses, participate in griha pravesham ceremony. Eatala Rajender was minister for seven years but didn’t construct 2BHKs. Not a single mahila bhavan was constructed here but I got 20 bhavans constructed in Siddipet,” he told a gathering of women in Huzurabad. The finance minister sanctioned four mahila bhavans in Huzurabad and promised to construct one each in every village. He sanctioned Rs 6 crore for development of roads, Rs 35 crore for improvement of civic amenities, 13-km cement concrete roads in Huzurabad town will be laid. “Any other remaining work would be completed by Gellu Srinivas Yadav after his victory from Huzurabad constituency,” Harish Rao said. He also launched a verbal attack against local MP Bandi Sanjay stating what has the BJP state president done for Huzurabad till date. Eatala is trying to invoke self-respect of the voters stating that TRS can buy the leaders but not the voters. “Even I was elected six times by you (voters) because you trust me. I am able to speak my heart out because I have come out of TRS. But Harish is speaking against his will in favour of KCR to save his ministerial berth. KCR is trying to buy people with money and I have confidence in them that they would teach him a lesson,” Eatala said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-plays-credibility-card-to-win-hearts-of-huzurabad-voters/articleshow/86213852.cms||Roushan Ali

There was no rainfall reported in Nashik since early Tuesday morning, although a few talukas in rural Nashik received good showers on Monday night. Over the last 24 hours, Nashik received around 33 mm rainfall, the bulk of rain was reported in Igatpuri, Peth and Surgana talukas. Officials from the district water resources department said that the water discharge from Gangapur dam has been reduced to around 2,200 cusecs after 7am on Tuesday. On Monday, over 4,009 cusecs of water was discharged following good rain in the catchment area. “However, there is a need to remain alert as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted more rainfall in Nashik. The water resources department has been monitoring the water position across all dams in the district,” added officials. The fire department of the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) said that the water level in Godavari river has reduced considerably since early Tuesday morning. “There is no alert from our department at present unlike yesterday. Nevertheless, people, especially those residing in low-lying areas along the river, should remain alert in case there is heavy rainfall in Nashik again for a prolonged period since it could lead to the water level rising in the dam and that would result in increased discharge of water,” added an official. NMC had issued an alert yesterday as the river water at Ramkund swelled forcing vendors to shift their kiosks near the river bank. Meanwhile, some devotees from the city immersed idols of Lord Ganapati on the fifth day of the festival at Ramkund. NMC had deployed staff to ensure there were no mishaps during the visarjan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/as-rain-abates-on-tuesday-gangapur-reduces-discharge/articleshow/86209311.cms||---

The affidavit was filed before NGT on behalf of the central government by Dr Murali Krishna, a scientist from the regional office of the Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change (MOEFCC) of Bengaluru. As per the EIA notification in 2006, railways or railway projects are not included in it. The notification issued by MOEFCC on Sept 14, 2006 covers 39 development projects and activities including airports, ports, national highways, and buildings. This does not include railways or railway projects. Therefore, Silverline project doesn’t require environmental permission, the affidavit said. The affidavit further pointed out the incident of the Supreme Court staying the order of NGT seeking environment clearance for the Noida-Greater Noida Metro Rail project. Meanwhile, Kerala Rail Development Corporation (K-Rail) has appointed a consortium, led by EQMS India Ltd, to conduct a comprehensive environmental impact assessment for Silverline project and asked it to complete the study and submit a report within 14 months. Silverline rail project is envisioned as a complete green project, said K-Rail officials in an earlier affidavit filed before NGT. They also stated that the project is funded by foreign financial institutions that have strict systems in place to monitor the environment and social causes of the project. K-Rail stated that it will obtain all legal permits required from the MOEFCC on time. Silverline is an ambitious project that aims to cover a distance of 530km from Kasaragod to Thiruvananthapuram in under four hours. The project is facing criticism from a cross-section of activists and public who consider it illogical and unwarranted, considering the ill effects it would have on the lives of thousands of evictees and the huge financial burden it would bring on the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/silverline-needs-no-prior-environmental-nod-centre/articleshow/86211433.cms||---
---||India||Why SC uses special powers to end marriages||NEW DELHI: As irretrievable breakdown of marriage has not been given legal backing as a ground for granting divorce by amending the law despite repeated recommendations of law commission starting from 1978, it is the Supreme Court which has become the last resort for aggrieved spouses to get the marriage dissolved and the court has over the years invoked its special power under Article 142 of the Constitution to grant divorce in cases where marriages have broken beyond repair. A day after the top court brought to an end a two-decade old protracted legal battle by a spouse to dissolve a marriage which had not even taken off with the wife deserting the husband on the day of marriage itself, it again invoked its power under Article 142 to do justice and granted divorce as the husband and the wife had been living separately for the last 16 years and the marriage was virtually dead. As the opposite parties in both the cases opposed dissolution of marriage despite living separately for years, the apex court invoked Article 142 and said courts can dissolve a marriage as irretrievably broken down only when it is impossible to save the marriage, all efforts have been made in that regard, the Court is convinced beyond any doubt that there is actually no chance of the marriage surviving, and it is broken beyond repair. Allowing the plea of a police officer from West Bengal whose plea of divorce was not allowed by family court and HC, a bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and B R Gavai said that the husband and the wife were living separately for more than 16 years and it was impossible for them to live together again under one roof as a couple. As the wife was not represented by any lawyer, the court appointed advocate Ranjan Mukherjee as amicus curiae to talk to her but he could not persuade her for amicable settlement. Pleading for the dissolution, senior advocate Nikhil Nayyar, appearing for the police officer, said the marriage is dead for all practical purposes. "Having scrutinised the material on record and considering the submissions made by Nikhil Nayyar and Ranjan Mukherjee, without commenting on the merits of the matter, the marriage between the parties is emotionally dead and there is no point in persuading them to live together any more. "Therefore, this is a fit case for exercise of jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution of India. The marriage between the parties is dissolved," the bench said. The court also asked the husband to pay Rs 25 lakh to wife as a full and final settlement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/why-sc-uses-special-powers-to-end-marriages/articleshow/86217813.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

CM also performed the foundation stone laying ceremony of 107 more school buildings at a function held online. CM said the public education rejuvenation mission launched by the last LDF government has brought about a huge jump in the infrastructure development of government and aided schools in the state. He said KIIFB has been the major source of funding for the construction of school infrastructure development. “The infrastructure development work is taking place at a good speed and it must be completed in a time-bound manner. We need to complete the process at a greater speed as no more delay in achieving the target could be condoned,” the CM said. Vijayan said the government target was to improve the facilities of all public schools to centres of excellence. For this, the government has spent Rs 400 crore in the public education sector during the last government’s period, he said. Vijayan said the reopening of schools in the state would be made possible at the earliest. The quality of education in Kerala would be revealed when the same is compared with the education during Covid-19 pandemic period elsewhere in the country and abroad. Quoting a study by Unesco, Vijayan said Covid badly affected the education of 126 crore children worldwide. It affected the education of 32 crore students in India,” he said, adding that the government was successful in bridging the digital divide among students through diligent and continuous efforts and programmes. Construction of school buildings inaugurated on Tuesday had cost Rs 214 crore and Rs 22 crore was spent for 48 higher secondary labs. Three libraries were set up spending Rs 85 lakh. Foundation stones were laid for the construction of 107 new buildings for which Rs 124 crore has been earmarked. General education minister V Sivankutty presided over the function in which finance minister K N Balagopal was the chief guest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/92-school-buildings-48-labs-unveiled/articleshow/86211481.cms||---
---||Goa||Transport dept, fitment staff baffled by digi-meter rules||Panaji: Confusion reigned supreme at the offices of the transport department as conflicting statements on the nature of “free” meters for taxi operators, as frantic calls from fitment staff poured in for clarifications on whether the state or the operator pays the initial cost of the fitment. “We receive nearly 100 calls a day asking us to clarify, we are totally fed up,” said a transport officer. The state government recently announced that digital meters would be offered for free, with chief minister Pramod Sawant on Wednesday claiming that he had solved the issue before Ganesh Chaturthi, as he said he would. “The government can launch a scheme to give the digital meters for free, but the government cannot pay the amount to the vendor,” the transport official said. “The amount must be paid by the taxi operators. Once they pay for the installation and submit the bill, they will get the entire amount reimbursed to their bank account.” However, last week, transport minister Mauvin Godinho made a diametrically opposite claim. As reported by TOI on Thursday, he said that as per the earlier arrangement, operators had to fit the meters and then apply for reimbursement. “Now, they will not be required to apply for reimbursement as they can get it for free at the installation stage itself,” he said. In a nutshell, the cost of the digital meter is to be borne by the state government. The amount must however be paid to the vendor at the initial stage by the taxi operator. “The taxi operators have been coming to the fitment centres demanding that it must be fitted for free, because the CM said so. The device however is not free on arrival for fitment,” sources said. The total amount for fitting the device (including GST and backend cost) is Rs 11,234. Initially, the taxi operator would get relief on the cost of the digital meter, which was Rs 8579, in two installments — the first immediately after fitment and the second one, a year after installation. Now, however, the chief minister has offered the entire digital meter free of cost, allowing the operators to claim the entire sum of Rs 11,234. A cabinet decision was taken to this effect. Meanwhile, president of the all-Goa bus owners’ association Sudeep Tamhankar, who is also a spokesperson for the taxi operators, said, “We had never demanded free digital meters in the first place, yet the chief minister has given a foolish statement to appease taxi votes”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/transport-dept-fitment-staff-baffled-by-digi-meter-rules/articleshow/86213937.cms||Nida Sayed

---||Delhi||Two weeks after Jammu and Kashmir ex-MLC’s murder, west Delhi cops nab one suspect||NEW DELHI: Almost two weeks after the murder of former Jammu and Kashmir legislative council member Trilochan Singh Wazir, the west Delhi police has nabbed a man from Jammu who claimed to be present in the flat where the killing took place on September 2. Rajendra alias Raju allegedly told police that Harpreet killed 67-year-old Wazir to avenge the death of his uncle. According to Raju, Harpreet’s uncle was killed in 1983 and he suspected Wazir’s hand behind it. At least two others, Harmeet and Billa, were also involved in the crime, he claimed. Wazir was given sedatives following which he was shot, Raju told the cops. After his formal arrest, Raju will be handed over to Crime Branch of Delhi Police, which is handling the case. Investigating officials claimed that Raju said he was present in the house with Harmeet, Harpreet and Billa and, after Wazir was shot dead, all four accused left one by one. Raju had gone to his in-laws’ house in Jammu, said an officer. Crime Branch has so far identified 34-year-old Harmeet as the prime suspect as he was apprehensive that Wazir was a threat to his life. Harpreet reportedly told Harmeet that Wazir had given a contract to eliminate the latter for Rs 4 crore and already paid Rs 2 crore. Police had also suspected Harpreet as the body was found in his flat on September 9. Police are scanning the Facebook profiles of Wazir, Harpreet and Harmeet to trace the conversations among them. As per investigations, Harmeet threatened Harpreet with a gun after killing Wazir and said he would take care of everything. According to an alleged confession note by Harmeet on Facebook , he had murdered Wazir. After the murder, Harpreet went to the IGI airport on the directions of Harmeet to convince the victim’s family members that he had taken a flight to Canada, claimed police. “The following day, Harpreet called Harmeet and told him that he was scared. On the pretext of trying to save themselves, Harmeet asked for some money. Harpreet sold his house stuff and gave Harmeet some money. The duo also decided to surrender. But when Harpreet started getting calls from police, they ran away. Harmeet also contemplated committing suicide,” an officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/two-weeks-after-jk-ex-mlcs-murder-cops-nab-one-suspect/articleshow/86213926.cms||---

The village came alive to the thrum of devotional songs on Tuesday evening as the 17 ‘kutumbs’ (joint families) took out their idols in procession for immersion on the completion of five days of festivity. This year, the Borkar tableau was an acknowledgement of the service of frontline warriors. It carried messages that praised and thanked them for their relentless efforts. All the idols were taken to the Datta mandap in the village and after a last joint prayer, the idols were immersed in the Zuari. Several canoes were arranged to take them to the middle of the river for immersion. Adpai is well known for its kutumb Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations, which sees clan members from all over congregating at their ancestral home. These 17 ‘kutumbs’ include the Kurdikar, Khandeparkar, Borkar, Mahalaxmi Bandodkar, Pokle, Soshebhatkar, Khumne Bhatkar, Mardolkar, Shivamba Lotlikar, Khandekar, Khalche Mule, Madhle Mule, Varche Mule, Mangni, Tari Lotlikar, Tari and Vasta clans. Union minister Shripad Naik is a native of the village and belongs to the Soshebhatkar kutumb. The family’s tableau portrayed the Goddess Navdurga, this year. Besides its distinctive immersion tradition, on the third day, Adpaikars stage scenes on various themes depicting religious and cultural beliefs at their homes, which also attracts people from across the state. All the families celebrate the festival for five days, Pradyumn Naik, a youth from the Sosebhatkar Kutumb, said. Last year, the villagers, whose Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations are famous in the state, had concluded the immersion ceremony without any festivity for the first time in their collective memory.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/pomp-makes-its-way-to-adpais-kutumb-immersion-tradition/articleshow/86214192.cms||Suraj P Kaisuvker

Since the past three days, jabs had been erratic. Since Saturday, the city had not been getting supply of Covishield and vaccination was largely done with Covaxin. This affected the inoculation process as some people were not keen to get jabbed with Covaxin even as the majority of those seeking a second dose had been vaccinated with Covishield in the first. On Tuesday, 17,106 doses were administered in the city. The number is the highest on a day in September. The large numbers, however, were largely because those who had missed the dose since Saturday came for vaccination. Meanwhile, three persons tested positive for Covid-19 in the city on Tuesday. With this, the total number of cases reported in the city and district reached 72,028. The new cases were reported from the Makarpura, Ajwa Road and Soma Talav areas even as no new cases were reported from outside the city limits.

"Hindi must be promoted in co-existence with other regional languages," Shah said in his address at the Hindi Diwas celebrations here. He said India must preserve its local languages for generations to come by making them flexible, functional and useful to all. Shah suggested that just like September 14 is an annual occasion to reassess and review efforts to promote Hindi, a similar and simultaneous exercise should be undertaken to promote all local languages. He underlined the role of 'swabhasha', along with 'swadeshi' and 'swaraj', in the freedom struggle, and said this would be one of the key themes of the year-long 'Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav' celebrations to mark the 75th anniversary of Independence. He appealed to parents and elders to speak to the young in their mother tongue, whatever be the medium of instruction in their schools, to keep them connected to their roots and familiar with their culture, traditions and history. The home minister, who has ensured that Hindi has pride of place in terms of medium of instruction as well as files relating to his own ministry, said Hindi has received a boost with PM Narendra Modi making it a point to address all international fora in Hindi, helping all Indians overcome any 'hesitation' in speaking the 'rajbhasha'. Shah also said the PM's constant outreach to all stakeholders in Hindi during the pandemic ensured that the nation could put up a united fight against Covid-19. "During this time, there were around 35 interactions of the PM with CMs, governors, trade bodies and addresses to the nation, all in Hindi. This ensured that the message percolated to the grassroots."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/hindi-friend-not-rival-of-regional-languages-amit-shah/articleshow/86217894.cms||---

He said a decision was taken in 2013 to hand over all Central Tibetan Schools (CTS) of the Union ministry of human resource and development to private Tibetan NGO Sambhota Tibetan Schools Society. He said in pursuance of above orders, CTS association has passed an order to hand over six schools to STSS. He said number of Tibetan students studying in these schools is negligible as compared to Indians students and moreover, Tibetans are running their own administered schools in the areas where they can accommodate their students whereas Indian students have no other option, but to drop out from schools if these schools are handed over to STSS. “I have requested the Union government not to transfer or hand over these schools to a private Tibetan NGO and to convert these schools as Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs) in view of strength of Indians students to safeguard their future,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/hp-minister-writes-to-centre-not-to-hand-over-school-to-tibetan-ngo/articleshow/86214577.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||3 institutes study Pb, Hry air quality, find small towns bad||Hisar: The seasonal burning of crop residue gives Haryana and Punjab country’s foulest air after the wheat and paddy harvests, so scientists have studied its pattern and relationship to formulate season-specific control measures. They find that dirty air is now a problem of even medium and small town. Experts from the environmental science and engineering department of Hisar’s Guru Jambheshwar University of Science and Technology (GJUST), Chandigarh’s Panjab University (PU), and the department of community medicine and School of Public Health at Chandigarh’s Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) have together examined the continuous air quality monitoring data to understand the seasonal variation and its link with weather and straw burning. A research journal of Germany’s Springer Science and Business Media published this study authored by Sahil Mor, Tanbir Singh, Narshi Ram Bishnoi, Santosh Bhukal and Ravindra Khaiwal. The seasonal variation in ambient air quality was judged on 14 parameters such as particulate matter (PM), trace gases, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), along with meteorological parameters. The data came from 23 monitoring stations of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) in 21 districts of the Haryana. The figures belonged to 2019, where the districts were divided into three zones based on ecology and cropping pattern. In all districts of Haryana, the annual mean particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations) in the air was much higher than the national standards. There was a considerable seasonal variation in the concentration of all pollutants in the air over Haryana. The pollution peaks post-monsoon (October-December), followed by winter. PM10 and PM2.5 increase by 65 to 112% and 131 to 147%, respectively after monsoon, while rains are the clean season that washes out atmospheric pollutants. The satellite-tracked field fires show a significant influence of straw burning after monsoon, followed by the burning of solid biomass (cow-dung cake, wood etc.) in Haryana’s winter. The particulate matter, considered a proxy of air pollution, usually, has an annual mean PM10 concentration in Zones-1, 2, and 3 as 156±86, 174±93, and 143±74 μgm−3, whereas for PM2.5, it is 71±44, 85±54, and 78±47 μg m−3. Lead author Narsi Ram Bishnoi of Hisar’s GJUST said the study of seasonal variation in Haryana’s ambient air quality will help to formulate season-specific control measures. He said: "Air pollution is seen as a problem of big cities usually, but it’s increasing even over the medium and small cities." PGI professor Ravindra Khaiwal said: "Farmers need to adopt sustainable practices to contain harmful emissions. The straw and cow-dung cakes they burn for cooking and heating in their rural kitchens is a major contributor to air pollution along with industrial and vehicular emissions. National Clean Air Programme, subsidised clean-cooking fuels, and subsidy for crop-residue management haven’t helped for want of public participation and awareness.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/3-institutes-study-pb-hry-air-quality-find-small-towns-bad/articleshow/86214769.cms||---

Agriculture director Sukhdev Singh Sidhu said the department had already given approval to 10,297 applications till now received from PACS, panchayats and CHCs registered under farmer societies and individual farmers for purchasing of 31,970 agri-machines to combat the menace of stubble burning. The department has issued sanctions in five phases for purchasing paddy straw management equipment, by which 10,023 machines were sanctioned for individual farmers, 15,498 for CHCs, 5,543 for panchayats, 906 for PACS on 50% to 80% subsidy, taking total number approved machines to 31,970 till date. Sidhu said the department would complete the task of distribution of these implements well before paddy harvesting season. He asked the applicants who have received sanctions, to procure agri-machines/equipment as soon as possible. He said 76,626 paddy straw management machines were given on subsidy to the farmers in the past three years. The director said Patiala, Sangrur, Barnala, Bathinda, Ferozepur, Muktsar, Tarn Taran, Moga and Mansa were also identified as hotspot districts, where most of paddy stubble burning cases were reported in the past. The state government was also making all out efforts to deploy a special task force for enforcement and regulatory measures in these districts so as to ensure the prevention of stubble burning incidents in the ensuing paddy harvesting season, he added. Under CRM scheme, the state government has focused on super SMS, super seeder, happy seeder, paddy straw chopper/shredder/mulcher, hydraulic reversible mould, board plough and zero till drill for in-situ management and baler and rake in ex situ on subsidy for the ease of the farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/31970-machines-sanctioned-for-paddy-straw-management-in-punjab/articleshow/86214803.cms||---

The new panel constituted by the Union ministry of commerce and industry to review the legislation, has convened a meeting on September 17, 2021, to seek views of the tea producers and manufacturers’ associations on its relevance in controlling/increasing production and exports of tea. In a letter issued on September 13, S Soundararajan, the director of tea development of the Tea Board, wrote that the committee will invite opinions from the industry stakeholders to examine the requirements of the existing licensing system as mandated under the Tea Act, 1953, and the Tea (Marketing) Control Order, 2003. Vivek Goenka, the chairman of the largest planters’ body Indian Tea Association (ITA), finds it to be a good initiative. “This will make it (the Tea Act) more relevant for today’s business environment.” The Union ministry of commerce and industry had formed a committee to review The Tea Act, 1953, through an official memo dated September 9, 2021, and recommended the amendment to make it more pertinent in the contemporary global scenario. The three main agendas that will be discussed in the virtual meeting will include current ground realities regarding implementation of The Tea Act, 1953. The president of the small tea growers’ umbrella body Cista, Bijoy Gopal Chakraborty, said: “We cannot restrict production. We should stress on enhancement of internal consumption and exports. Most of the sections of the Tea Act, 1953, are now irrelevant. We want an industry-friendly Tea Act without any licencing bar for ease-of-doing-business.” BOX Garden workers’ bonus fixed at 20% Jalpaiguri: In a virtual bipartite meeting between the tea planters and trade unions, the festival bonus was settled at 20% of the salary on Tuesday evening. The labour unions had demanded a 20% bonus across all the four garden categories — A, B, C and D — in parity with the last year. All the workers of the 183 gardens of the Dooars (158) and Terai (45) will get the bonus at this rate. However, 20 sick and closed gardens have been given a waiver. A similar bipartite meeting will decide the fate of the workers of the 87 tea gardens in Darjeeling on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/planters-invited-to-tea-act-rejig-meet/articleshow/86212599.cms||Sovon Manna
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Future tense for Hindi medium schools||JAIPUR: Hindi medium schools are not a preferred choice for most parents in Rajasthan. As most of the top institutes in India impart knowledge in English, parents prefer to send children to English medium schools. To cater to this rising demand, more English schools are opening up while Hindi medium schools are slowly converting to English medium. Every year, more than 3000 Hindi medium schools are applying to state education department for permission to start teaching in English. Earlier, there were a lot of Hindi schools in Rajasthan, but the trend is fast changing. Anil Kumar, principal of Tagore Vidhya Bhawan Senior Secondary School, said the school was once a Hindi medium school but is now offering education in both mediums. “In fact, applications in Hindi medium are dwindling. Parents have realised that be it competitive exams or jobs in MNCs, English is a must. In coming years, we will completely shift to English medium,” said Kumar. A similar response was given by Ashok Vaid, principal of MPS Jawahar Nagar. He said one of their branches, Maheshwari High Secondary School, teaches in both mediums, but more students are opting for English. Rajasthan government has opened more than 500 government English medium schools in recent days. Chief minister Ashok Gehlot announced in the last budget that every village with more than 5,000 population will have an English medium school. Anil Sharma, president of School Shiksha Pariwar, said in the next decade there will hardly any Hindi medium school left in the state. He said it was state government’s responsibility to give students an option to study in the mother tongue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/rajasthan-future-tense-for-hindi-medium-schools/articleshow/86224823.cms||Parul Kulshrestha
---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Mystery shrouds death of 100 crows in Chikhaldara||NAGPUR: At a time when the population of crows is declining, over 100 crows were found dead under the jurisdiction of the Chikhaldara Municipal Council (CMC) on Sunday. However, animal husbandry department officials claimed only six crows died. Vice-president of CMC Abdul Sheikh, who first raised the issue, slammed the animal husbandry doctors for not staying at the headquarters to ensure the number of birds’ deaths and solutions thereon. “This is for the first time that such large-scale deaths of crows was reported and people, who came complaining to me, are themselves witnesses,” Sheikh said. “We collected only six crows for sampling while the remaining birds were disposed of in a tractor, a fact not known to the foresters and veterinary staff. The crows were lying dead at various spots near pipal trees where vendors sold mutton and chicken in the open on Sunday,” Sheikh told TOI. “The incident occurred on Sunday and Monday, too, was a holiday. There were no livestock development officers at the veterinary hospital (LDOs). Hence, we handed over the case to the Chikhaldara range forest officer (RFO). I don’t know what happened later,” Sheikh said. Crows are listed under Schedule V of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, but have been legally declared as vermin. After vultures vanished, crows have been playing the role of predators and scavengers. They eat practically anything. Melghat Tiger Reserve (MTR) CCF & field director Jayoti Banerjee said, “I’ve been told by my RFO at Chikhaldara that pesticide is suspected to be the reason for the death of the birds. It’s not bird flu. After the municipal staff handed over the six dead crows to the staff, veterinary doctors collected the samples to know the cause of death. The birds were later buried.” Talking to TOI, Amravati district animal husbandry officer Dr Vijay Rahate denied death of 100 crows. “There were six crows. There is no major reason to worry. I suspect the birds died of food poisoning may be after scavenging on flesh thrown as waste in the area.” “Samples are being sent to the Regional Disease Investigation Laboratory, Pune, for toxicological and bacterial tests. Had it been some epidemic, more crows would have been found dead in the last two days but we have not found a single dead bird. We are keeping a close watch and our staff is alert. Bird flu is also ruled out as the reason for death,” said Dr Rahate. Dr Ajay Poharkar, president, Maharashtra State Veterinary Council (MSVC), said it could also be the West Nile Virus (WNV), which has been detected in several birds, mostly crows and jays. “But unless it’s proved scientifically it would not be right to comment. Similar deaths of crows had occurred near Mouda in the summer of 2005,” the raptor scientist said. “I believe the population of crows is declining fast. In Melghat, there are huge trees and hence, the crow population there is in sizeable numbers. The loss of birds is an eye-opener for the forest department which should come with research on the subject,” said Dr Poharkar. Bird expert Nitin Marathe says, “Rapid disappearance of crows is a cause for concern. One of the major reasons for the decline is habitat destruction. Generally, crows prefer strong trees like pipal and banyan for nesting. These trees are being destroyed for road expansion and urbanization. Hence, they are left in very few pockets in the city.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/mystery-shrouds-death-of-100-crows-in-chikhaldara/articleshow/86212632.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar
---||Goa||Goa govt finally notifies rules to conduct eligibility test for elementary teachers||PANAJI: Twelve years after the Right to Education (RTE) came into being, the state government has finally notified the norms for the Goa Teacher Eligibility Test (GTET). As per the provision of the RTE Act, it is essential for a teacher to qualify in the test to be employed to teach from Classes I to VIII. But for 12 years, Goa did not implement this requirement and notification of the norms have finally paved the way for the GTET to be held from 2021. “The government of Goa is pleased to declare that the persons desirous to be teachers in Classes I to VIII (elementary) shall be required to qualify the GTET. GTET will be conducted by SCERT, Goa from 2021 onwards,” the notification stated. The state said that answering the exam and qualifying will be mandatory for teachers being appointed to teach from Classes I to VIII, even if the school is not receiving any grants from the state government. Three years ago, around 800 government primary school teachers were recruited and the state had set the condition that they would have to clear the GTET for their services to be confirmed. But the test was not conducted and the teachers continued to teach based on their selection carried out through a written test. From this year, two separate GTET will be conducted — for those who wish to teach Classes I to V and for those who want to teach Classes VI to VIII. “All questions in GTET will be Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs), with four alternatives out of which one answer will be most appropriate. Each question will carry one mark and there will be no negative marking for wrong response,” the notification stated. A person must score 60% or at least 90 out of 150 marks in the test to pass. SCERT will issue certificates to all successful candidates qualifying in the GTET. “The certificate shall be valid for life time. There is no restriction on the number of attempts a person can take for acquiring a GTET certificate. A person who has qualified GTET may also appear again for improving his/her score,” the state said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/state-finally-notifies-rules-to-conduct-eligibility-test-for-elementary-teachers/articleshow/86212663.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar
---||Goa||Nation based on religion is a false concept, can’t exist, says Goa governor||PANAJI: The idea of a nation built around a religion or a singular school of thought is bound to fail, said Goa governor PS Sreedharan Pillai on Tuesday. Reflecting on the 1971 war that led to the creation of Bangladesh, Pillai asked students and Indians to study the factors that led to the war, and urged the people of India to put aside their religion and unite. Pillai called the 1971 India-Pakistan conflict as “India’s greatest achievement in war”, and said that the Indian Armed forces made a permanent contribution to peace, democracy and human rights by defeating Pakistan and liberating Bangladesh. “The 1971 Bangladesh war, according to me, is because of the false concept of a nation based on religion on a particular school of thought. It will never exist,” said Pillai, speaking at Azad Maidan to commemorate Swarnim Vijay Varsh, the ‘Golden Jubilee’ of victory over Pakistan in 1971. “It is a matter to think about even now, it is relevant to think about its pros and cons. I am stressing this...our concept was that all the religions born in the world were welcomed by us. There was no persecution,” said Pillai. “Present students and others should study the background of the Bangladesh war.” While stressing on India’s secular credentials, Pillai pointed out that Mahatma Gandhi and several others who fought for Independence stood for a unified India which was not divided based on religion. “Then one group of people, I am not mentioning any names, they stated that no, religion is the basis for a country, so we want a separate country. As a student of history, I am wondering whether the people who migrated from present India — Goa, Kerala, Maharashtra — who went to Karachi and Dhaka, were accepted as proper citizens of that country,” said Pillai. Several 1971 war veretans were felicitated at Azad Maidan by Pillai and chief minister Pramod Sawant. “We can proudly say that the greatest achievement of our country in the field of war was the victory of 1971. The goal is a permanent contribution to the peace, democracy and human rights to the world,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/nation-based-on-religion-is-a-false-concept-cant-exist-says-governor/articleshow/86212713.cms||---

After last week’s demolition drive in Nanjangud, Mysuru district, which evoked sharp reactions from parties and the public, Bommai said the government has asked all deputy commissioners to not take any “hurried and hasty” decision on demolition of temples built on public land. “We will study the Supreme Court order in detail and issue specific directives in this regard,” he added. The first directive from the Supreme Court came on September 29, 2009, which asked state governments to demolish illegal religious places constructed on public land. Since the order was not implemented in toto, a series of public interest litigation were filed in the Karnataka high court. The same order was reiterated by the high court last year. The CM said he will call a cabinet meeting in a day or two with temple demolition as the specific agenda. “We’ll take a clear stand at the meeting,” he said, adding he would give a detailed reply on the issue in the ongoing legislature session. Earlier in the day, revenue minister R Ashoka hinted that the government will make its stand clear on the issue soon, while reiterating that the court order must be obeyed and the demolition operation should be carried out without hurting the feelings of people. The CM said a show-cause notice has been issued to the Nanjangud administration on the demolition and added its response was expected within two days. Mysuru deputy commissioner Bagadi Gautham confirmed that the government has sought a report on the demolition of Mahadevamma temple in Uchchagani village in Nanjangud taluk. In Mysuru, the controversial drive has been paused with the state government seeking a report on the campaign and the Mysuru City Corporation deciding to reassess the list of 93 shrines marked for demolition. A senior corporation officer said they will find out how structures could be saved from demolition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/stop-temple-demolitions-will-study-sc-order-says-karnataka-cm-basavaraj-bommai/articleshow/86217953.cms||---

Justice Amol Rattan Singh of the HC passed the order while hearing a petition filed by a runaway couple from Haryana's Jind district. The court also ordered the state authorities to determine the actual age of the girl and take legal action if her age was found to be false. "There is no firm proof of age of either of the petitioners other than their Aadhaar cards, which is actually no proof as no documentary proof is usually asked for at the time of applying for the Aadhaar card or the issuance thereof. Hence, if upon actual verification the age of the petitioners, especially petitioner No. 1 (girl), is found to be below marriageable age in terms of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, this order will not bar proceedings under the provisions of that act, all offences punishable under the provisions of the said act being cognisable in terms of Section 15 thereof," the HC said. Justice Amol Rattan, however, ordered the Jind police to protect the couple. In this case, the couple from Jind, who had married against the wishes of the girl's family on August 26, had approached the court seeking protection of life and liberty from their family and relatives. The court was clear that it would not rely on the Aadhaar cards presented by the couple as proof of their age.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/aadhaar-not-a-valid-document-for-proof-of-age-says-high-court/articleshow/86217930.cms||---

The idea is that Congress should pursue public programmes like agitations on issues of common interest in such a way that they create a deeper imprint on people's mind for the party. An AICC panel to plan "sustained agitation on national issues", chaired by Digvijaya Singh, flagged inflation, unemployment, farm laws, national monetisation pipeline among a few others, as concerns which require intensive protests. The panel unanimously felt that the party should perform better on the agitation front as its present strategy results in protests which are one-day affairs and fleeting in nature. As a corrective measure, the panel members including Priyanka Gandhi Vadra argued that better coordination should be established with all Congress fronts and outfits and voluntary organisations, so that the protests have a focused approach.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/congress-looks-to-cash-in-on-anger-against-bjp-convert-it-to-votes/articleshow/86218051.cms||---

The trial of Umifenovir on 132 Covid patients showed that if proper dose is given twice daily for five days, the drug can effectively reduce viral load in mild or moderate symptomatic and asymptomatic patients by checking multiplication of the virus. Titled 'Phase III, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled trial of efficacy, safety and tolerability of Umifenovir vs standard care of therapy in non-severe Covid patients', the clinical trial was conducted at three institutions - King George's Medical University, Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences and Era's Lucknow Medical College and Hospital. "Since Umifenovir is a broad spectrum antiviral and is being used as a safe over-the-counter drug for influenza and pneumonia for over 20 years in many countries, the first two trials were not mandatory. CDRI directly went for phase-III trial," CDRI director Tapas Kundu said. "In a study, double-blind mode improves reliability of results by preventing bias when doctors evaluate patients' outcomes. Results showed patients didn't experience side-effects," he said. Chief scientist, CDRI, R Ravishankar, said, "Experts said the drug is safe for pregnant women and children."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cdri-trials-show-drug-cuts-viral-load-in-mild-covid-cases/articleshow/86218096.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Intensity of rain to lessen over next few days, says IMD||PANAJI: The intensity of rain over Goa will be comparatively lesser compared to the past 48 hours due to a weakening of the deep depression in the Bay of Bengal and lack of any new systems forming in the coming days. “The deep depression over north interior Odisha weakened into a depression. As of September 14 it is over north Chhattisgarh and adjoining north interior Odisha. It is very likely to continue to move west northwestwards across north Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh and weaken into a well-marked low-pressure area during next 48 hours,” the India meteorological department (IMD) said. Besides the weakening of the depression there are no other systems scheduled to form over the next three to four days. Light to moderate rainfall will continue across the state, but there will be a slight reduction as compared to the rain received over the previous days. With the current monsoon season approaching its end very soon, this reduction in rainfall is an annual feature.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/intensity-of-rain-to-lessen-over-next-few-days-imd/articleshow/86213605.cms||---

However, the data is being hotly contested by officials on the ground. Ilanthila in Dakshina Kannada reported 117 cases over the past 28 days — August 15 to September 12 — while Doddathoguru in Bengaluru Urban district recorded 89 cases in the same period. Of these, 21 and 22 cases respectively came in the past one week. The two are among 20 worst-hit rural areas listed by the War Room as on September 12. However, village-level data compiled by local health officials shows much lower numbers. Officials point out that addresses given while swab samples were taken may have led to errors. War Room officials conceded that they will have to recheck the data. Ilanthila in Belthangady taluk has a population of 4,500 people. Those who need treatment must travel to Belthangady or Puttur taluk. Dr Kishore Kumar, district health officer, Dakshina Kannada, said Belthangady saw very little Covid exposure in the first wave, but had many cases during the second wave. But he categorically added: “Ilanthila is not one of the worst-hit villages. The test positivity rate was 1.7 %. The data needs to be re-examined.” Data from Kaniyuru primary health centre that covers Ilanthila, shows the entire village has seen only 96 cases since April and only two cases so far in September. “There must be data entry errors,” said Dr Diana Savitha, medical officer, Kaniyuru PHC. “The wrong pin code given during the time of taking swab samples may have led to these errors. The village has seen two Covid deaths since April this year.” While War Room data shows Bengaluru Urban’s Doddathoguru had 89 cases in the past four weeks, district health authorities say only 65 people have tested positive. The village, with a population of 5,884, covers a portion of Electronics City. Since March 2020, the village has seen 1,697 cases and nine deaths. “If people give Electronics City as their address, in some instances they end up falling under Doddathoguru,” said Dr Manohar N, district surveillance officer, Bengaluru Urban. “We have not missed any cases. There have been no clusters, but we have had individual cases here and there.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/two-worst-hit-villages-in-karnataka-see-huge-covid-surge-data-errors-suspected/articleshow/86218094.cms||Sunitha Rao R
---||Delhi||Delhi: On terror trail, sleuths focus on camp in Pakistan||NEW DELHI: The investigation into the ISI terror module busted by the Intelligence Bureau and Delhi Police's Special Cell is now focused on the training camp in Thatta, Pakistan, which was earlier used by the Pakistan Special Service Group and the shadowy Inter-Services Intelligence to train Ajmal Kasab for the 26/11 attack in Mumbai in 2008, sources said. Two of the six men arrested in the current operation had been taken by their Pakistani recruiters to a camp in the same area along with another two dozen draftees via the sea route from Muscat, according to investigators. Thatta has been in the scanner of Indian intelligence for being home to training camps for Lashkar-e-Tayyaba, Jaish-e-Mohammed and other Pak-backed terror groups. It is also a well-known launchpad for trained terrorists. The investigation and the interrogation of suspects has not only revealed details of how Pakistan's military has been training recruits from India and Bangladesh, but it has also exposed an altogether new route adopted by ISI to admit the draftees into Pakistan and the Afghanistan-Pak region. The Indian agents, sources said, were tracking a Delhi youth, Mohammad Osama alias Sami, since April-end when he left the country. The review of his passport and travel details show that Osama left for Muscat, Oman, on April 22 by Salaam Air flight from Lucknow. After reaching Muscat, Osama was summoned to a flat where he met another man named Zeeshan who had reached there from Prayagraj in UP (also arrested in this case). Soon, they were joined by 15-16 Bangladeshi nationals. They were divided into sub-groups, and Zeeshan and Osama found themselves in the same group. "Over the next few days, the recruits made several short sea journeys, changing boats a number of times. They were taken to a town named Jiwani near Gwadar port in Pakistan," disclosed Pramod Kushwaha, DCP (Special Cell). The accused, who are being interrogated by a special team led by ACP Lalit Mohan Negi and Hriday Bhushan, have confirmed during questioning that their group was received by a Pakistani national after reaching Jiwani and then taken to a farmhouse in Thatta city in Sindh province. "There were three Pakistani nationals at the farmhouse,” added Kushwaha. “Two of them, Jabbar and Hamza, imparted training to the group. Both were from the Pakistan Army as evidenced by their military uniforms." The recruits were also taken to Karachi, the six arrested men have revealed. The training, which the recruits referred to as Askari or military course, lasted for around 15 days. They were trained in IED assembly and bomb making, apart from ways in which to carry out arson using items of daily use. They were also trained in handling small firearms and AK-47s. After the training, the group was taken back to Muscat via the same route and then scattered as per the schedule decided by Anees Ibrahim. The investigators are now busy ascertaining what the module and its sleeper cells have been up to in the last three months. Delhi Police has a confirmed tip-off that several consignments of armament were being dispatched to India as part of the operation. On Tuesday evening, the accused were jointly interrogated about a consignment of 100 pistols, cartridges, a tiffin bomb and five grenades dropped in Amritsar, Punjab, by a drone in August. Cops suspect the weapons and explosives was destined for members of this group. The tiffin bomb also had 2-3kg of RDX. The arms, explosives and ammunition recovered in the current operation are being studied by experts to trace their source and the network. The investigators are also trying to trace the Bangladeshi trainees. The antecedents of Osama and Zeeshan are also being ascertained. The former has claimed to have studied up to BA third year at Allahabad University. Abu Bakar is a hafiz by profession, while Jaan Mohammed Sheikh alias Sameer Kaliya has been a D Company member for two decades, cops said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/on-terror-trail-sleuths-focus-on-camp-in-pak/articleshow/86213408.cms||Raj Shekhar

---||Goa||Goa: Driver faces homicide charge for parking truck dangerously on national highway at Pernem||PANAJI: A Mapusa court has ordered a driver of a tipper and the accused in a 2017 case, Santosh Lamani, 27, to answer charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder for parking a truck in a dangerous manner after it broke down on the national highway at Pernem, which had resulted in an accident and death of one. The accused had not used any precautionary measures to warn other vehicle drivers that his tipper was parked and a car had dashed into his truck at night. The court has ordered him to also answer charges of Section 337 (causing hurt by acting rashly), Section 338 (causing grievous hurt), and Section 177 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. The court held that “the onus was on the driver” to not have obstructed the national highway. “Hence, I find that the fault cannot be said to be of the Tata Safari driver, but that of the accused alone,” the court stated. It also observed that the acts of omission of the accused in taking necessary precautions in respect of the dangerously parked tipper truck caused death and injuries to the other occupants of the Tata Safari. The accused could have moved the truck safely away, the court stated. “… the sketch of the scene of accident shows that there was two metres katcha road on the left hand side of the Patradevi to Dhargal lane of the road where the accused, with the help of the mechanic, could have moved the truck safely away from the main highway,” ad hoc additional sessions judge Bosco G F Roberts stated. Public prosecutor Ralston Barreto submitted to the court that the accused had not switched on hazard or parking lights nor did he take any precautionary measures in the form of symbols or reflective tapes on the body of the truck to indicate its presence on the road where it was pitch dark. As a result the Tata Safari dashed into the truck, which was obstructing the road. Barreto further submitted that the accused dangerously parked the truck after it broke down in the middle of the NH-17 highway at Naibag, Pernem and the truck completely occupied the Patradevi to Dhargal lane of the two-way national highway. He added that the truck broke down at 3pm while the accident took place at 1.30am the next day providing the driver with enough time to have made arrangements to move the truck away from the national highway or at the very least set up some warning signs to warn other motorists.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/driver-faces-homicide-charge-for-parking-truck-dangerously-on-nh/articleshow/86213651.cms||---

The youth, who works at a laboratory kit manufacturing unit in Goa, had returned home for Ganesha festival. Dakshina Kannada DHO Dr Kishore Kumar said the man currently has no symptoms of Nipah infection, and he had not visited Kerala where the virus is prevalent. His samples have been sent for testing to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune. The DHO said the youth had got drenched while riding his bike from Goa. He had developed a fever and searched about Nipah viral infection over the internet and got scared that he had contracted the infection. He is technically not a suspected case of Nipah. It’s a case of palpitations and anxiety with fear of Nipah. He is being counselled,” Kumar said. The man first reported fever on September 11 and went to hospitals in Karwar and Udupi, and then Mangaluru. “He is absolutely fine and showing no symptoms,” Kumar said. Dakshina Kannada deputy commissioner Dr KV Rajendra said the youth worked at a unit manufacturing RT-PCR and Nipah kits. “Suspecting that he may have contracted the Nipah virus infection, the man self-reported at KMC, Manipal, for treatment on Saturday. Later, he was referred to Government Wenlock District Hospital in Mangaluru. Though he did not have any symptoms, the hospital has isolated him and his father, who accompanied him, as a precautionary measure. His sample results are expected in 24-48 hours,” the DC said. “We have received confirmation the industrial unit has not sent samples for tests and they have been following all SOPs. He has not come into contact with any suspected Nipah patient,” the DC said. The administration has asked his family members to isolate themselves.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-karwar-man-fears-nipah-virus-samples-sent-to-punes-niv/articleshow/86218126.cms||---

Medicinal plants such as neem could also be planted along the highway, GCCI said. This, GCCI said, will not only increase the state’s tree cover, but also generate additional income for the state. GCCI’s agriculture and food processing committee chairman Mahesh Patil, vice chairman Orlando Rodrigues, director Sanjay Amonkar and assistant director Ambika Dhakhenkar met with PWD chief engineer for national highways Dinesh Gupta to discuss the ongoing highway tree plantation drive. “The members proposed that the concerned authority should select fruit-bearing trees suitable to Goan environment, which will have various benefits such as generating income for the state in terms of harvested fruits for exports or plants with medicinal values,” GCCI said. GCCI’s suggestion was well-received by Gupta who assured them he would take it forward with his team.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/plant-fruit-trees-medicinal-saplings-along-highways/articleshow/86213791.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

An agency team returned to the party office on Tuesday morning, “collected more information” and asked village-level Trinamool worker Rabi Murmu to meet CBI officers in Durgapur, West Burdwan. Trinamool’s Illambazar block president Fazlul Rahman said the CBI team came to the party office to collect information about workers in Gopalnagar village. Another local Trinamool leader, Babar Ali, said the investigators asked for a few phone numbers and details of Gopalnagar booth committee members. “They asked us to compile the information,” Rahman said and added: “We will cooperate with the agency, but we think that this is a conspiracy to malign our party.

They have also flayed the panchayat body for failing in its duty to inspect and clean the drains before every monsoon. When someone brings construction material like bricks, concrete, sand or cement, the concerned person is duty-bound to clean out the drains before the monsoon and return it to its original position, residents said. However, this is not happening, they lamented. Another issue raised by the locals is that of illegal constructions. They said that while issuing construction licences, the authorities must ensure that all guidelines are followed and compliance adhered to.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/building-debris-clogging-drains-in-shristhal-irks-locals/articleshow/86213855.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Youth who pulled Mumbai woman’s dupatta gets 1-year rigorous imprisonment||MUMBAI: Ruling that in offences directly affecting life and right to privacy of a woman, an accused cannot be let off on a bond of good behaviour, a magistrate’s court has convicted and sentenced a 23-year-old man to one-year rigorous imprisonment for outraging the modesty of a Chembur woman by snatching her dupatta on a public road in 2016. Metropolitan magistrate Sharad S Pardeshi said that while no fault lay with the woman, the accused, Abrar Khan, pulled off her dupatta in a public place. While rejecting his release on a bond of good behaviour, the court also fined the convict Rs 5,000. Court relies on woman’s deposition over friend’sThis conduct of the accused…indicates that he is having errant behaviour with the informant (woman) and if such conduct is viewed leniently by extending the benefit of provisions under Probation of Offenders Act, it will send the wrong message in the society. Any leniency shown to the accused may instigate him to repeat a similar offence against the women,” the court said. The Probation of Offenders Act provides for a convict to be released on a bond of good behaviour instead of serving a sentence. The woman was among the witnesses examined by the prosecution. She said that on March 24, 2016, she was out with her grandmother on the eve of the Holi festival, when the accused came from behind on his motorcycle and honked loudly. He then snatched her dupatta. The woman said that when she protested, he started abusing her. The woman identified the accused with the help of her husband’s friend who was also at the spot. Since the friend and Khan live in the same neighbourhood, she found out his name and other details. She then informed her husband and they approached the police. The friend and another witness deposed in court, but claimed that the accused had only argued with the woman as a dispute arose over his honking. They both claimed that the accused had not snatched the dupatta. But the court relied on the woman’s deposition. “Before the occurrence of the incident, the accused and the informant were not on inimical terms. Thus, the informant had no reason to lodge a false report against the accused. In the circumstances, false implication of the accused due to some previous grudge is out of question,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/youth-who-pulled-mumbai-womans-dupatta-gets-1-year-rigorous-imprisonment/articleshow/86218156.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Kolkata||Asymptomatic Covid cases rise in Kolkata, doctors see mass vaccination behind trend||KOLKATA: Asymptomatic Covid patients — a fallout of mass vaccination — are rising across city’s private hospitals, often leaving doctors stumped and delaying non-Covid treatment for which they are seeking admission. Scores of patients who had planned surgeries, procedures or implants scheduled since August have tested positive in mandatory Covid tests at the time of hospital admission though they had none of the usual signs of the virus. There could be several reasons behind this, say experts, including resistance offered by vaccination that blunts the impact of Covid. Last week, a 70-year-old patient tested positive at the time of admission at Peerless Hospital for a knee surgery. According to doctors, he had no fever, cough or breathing distress. Nor had anyone in his family tested positive. “There have been several others like him who tested positive and had to be put in the Covid ward,” said Peerless CEO Sudipta Mitra. At AMRI Hospitals, around 5% of patients seeking admission for planned surgeries have tested positive over the last two weeks. “They were completely asymptomatic and had to return without surgeries. Since they didn’t require emergency treatment, they opted for home quarantine,” said AMRI CEO Rupak Barua. There have been asymptomatic Covid cases since the first wave but with vaccination, their number has increased as inoculation is resulting in mild and muted symptoms, says RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS) intensivist Sauren Panja, . “That apart, ‘host factor’ also decides the severity of symptoms. Individual immune systems react differently to a viral or bacterial attack, generating mild or severe symptoms. Also, the viral load varies from one patient to another resulting in very pronounced symptoms in some and almost none in others,” explained Panja. He added that there could be a further rise in the number of such patients. In a vaccinated population, the number of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients will rise exponentially, says Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education & Research (IPGMER) professor Diptendra Sarkar. “Mild or no symptoms will now be the order of the day. Asymptomatic patients prove that mass vaccination has had the desired result,” said Sarkar. Panja, however, warned that asymptomatic patients need to be quarantined like any other Covid patient. “While they may not require strong medication, they are still carriers of the virus and may end up transmitting the disease to many. So, RT-PCR tests ought to be stringent now,” he said. Rate of positivity has started climbing at Peerless Hospital since last week. “It had dropped to 2%-3% in August. It’s close to 10% now which is a spurt but most are again asymptomatic and have not been seeking hospitalization, choosing to recover in isolation,” said Mitra. Ignoring Covid protocol, however, could be dangerous, warned Belle Vue Clinic internal medicine consultant Rahul Jain. “If the number of Covid patients swell, those with severe symptoms will increase, too. This could again lead to a rise in hospital admissions, which, we need to prevent. It’s better to have more asymptomatic patients provided we can quickly identify and isolate them” said Jain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/asymptomatic-cases-rise-in-city-docs-see-mass-vax-behind-trend/articleshow/86215749.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
