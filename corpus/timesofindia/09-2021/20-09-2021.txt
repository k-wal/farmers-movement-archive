This is to cushion the burden of retail consumers. With the move resulting in immediate revenue losses, the council headed by the Union finance minister and representatives of states being its members preferred status quo despite the Kerala high court’s order to consider inclusion of motor fuels into the GST regime. Experts said moving petrol and diesel under the GST regime would have resulted in a drastic dip in retail prices, bringing relief to consumers. For instance, a litre of petrol in Karnataka currently attracts tax of Rs 59 that includes Rs 32.9 central additional excise duty (AED) and 35% of state sales tax on the sum of base price (Rs 41.8) and AED.  While the Centre last year increased AED by Rs 10 and Rs 13 on a litre of petrol and diesel, respectively, the state government hiked sales tax on them from 32% to 35% and 21% to 24%, respectively. The base price of the fuels, in the interim, spiked exponentially and the state’s average monthly revenue from the sales of petrol and diesel went up from Rs 1,100 crore to Rs 1,700 crore. But under GST, there will be a maximum tax of 28% on the base price of a litre of petrol and as a result, the retail price would have decreased from the present Rs 104.70 to Rs 56.5 (including Rs 3 dealer commission). The price of diesel would have fallen from Rs 94 to Rs 56.69. “The state government has gained a windfall revenue because of the ad valorem nature of the tax structure, where the quantum of tax increases with the increase of base price. But now, it is the duty of the Centre and the state to provide respite to people,” said KM Basave Gowda, president of Akhila Karnataka Petroleum Dealers Association. Noting that the consumption of fuels has fallen by 40% after the price hike, Gowda said it will increase if the taxes are reduced and the state’s revenue will also go up.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/trade-bodies-cut-fuel-tax-to-reduce-retail-prices/articleshow/86351738.cms||B V Shiva Shankar
---||India||A ‘turbaned Dalit’, Channi ticked all right boxes for Cong||NEW DELHI: When the names of Sunil Jakhar, Ambika Soni, Sukhjinder Randhawa were being discussed as possible replacements for Amarinder Singh, they represented politically important social groups like non-Sikh, Punjabi Hindu and Jatt Sikh communities to balance the high profile state unit chief Navjot Sidhu who is a Jatt Sikh. It was during the calculations on the pros and cons of these constituencies that the leadership threw a hitherto politically ignored group in the mix to expand the social basket. "Find a turbaned dalit" was the crisp demand. The choices by late Saturday zeroed on either Jakhar or a "dalit" or mazhabi Sikh. And Charanjit Channi crossed the tape. Sources said only he was found in the reckoning, qualifying on the important criteria like member of the leadership group - a former leader of opposition, senior minister and also Amarinder critic. Sources said the final decision to pick Channi was of Rahul Gandhi, who has long been expressing views in favour of a dalit CM. It also had the obvious political calculation of winning over the sprawling and expectant social group in Punjab, and undercutting attempts by Akali Dal, AAP and BJP on this front, while also positioning the Congress to tap its goodwill in the rest of the country. Channi's name apparently moved forward during the discussions held by Rahul Gandhi with senior leader Ambika Soni and the central observers stationed in Chandigarh who were also seeking the views of the MLAs. Having two Jatt Sikhs in the key positions of state unit chief and the CM's chair was seen to skew the political equation going into elections - a briefly held combine when Sidhu became the PCC chief recently while Amarinder was the CM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/a-turbaned-dalit-channi-ticked-all-right-boxes-for-cong/articleshow/86351889.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Engineering students to pursue 3 internships from 2021-22||BENGALURU: With the new National Education Policy (NEP) set to be implemented from academic year 2021-22, engineering students joining colleges in the state will have to pursue three internships instead of one that is currently the norm. The three internships include one after first year (three-week duration), another after second year (four weeks) and the last during the seventh semester (24 weeks).  The college can also split the students into two groups in the seventh semester — 50% will go for internship in the seventh semester and resume classes in the eighth and the other 50% will be on campus in the seventh semester and intern in the next. The first summer internship will be within the institution. In the second one, students will have to work with industries, government bodies, NGOs and MSMEs among others in areas related to their interests or streams.  The third internship can either be with the industry or involve research at centres for excellence set up in colleges, universities or companies. “All industries will accept students because they will have intelligent, confident, high-quality manpower with them for six months. The Karnataka government is working on connecting corporates to offer internships with stipends. It is also working on a portal for mapping students with industries...Financially strong students can also pursue internships in companies abroad,” explained VTU vice-chancellor Karisidappa. He said many points mentioned in NEP have already been implemented in the university since 2018. Students have to pursue ability enhancement courses as well as universal human values. While these courses are mandatory in the first two semesters, students can also choose one from the options provided in third to sixth semesters. Open elective courses will also include multidisciplinary ones, those on NCC, yoga, sports, music and fine arts, etc. Students in fourth semester will have to compulsorily learn the subject, biology for engineers. Unlike the present system where students have to earn 175 credits, they will have to earn 160 credits. Students can earn 18-20 extra credits to pursue honours degree. They can also get a minor degree in a stream of their interest by pursuing additional courses to earn extra 18-20 credits. Currently, 40% of marks are derived from internal assessments. Henceforth, 50% of formative assessments and 50% of end-of-semester exams will be used. Formative assessments will be through innovative means, including open-book exams and quizzes among others. Such assessments are conducted in a way to test the learning ability of students. A blended mode of teaching — digital along with classroom teaching — will be the new focus. “Train teachers in online teaching. The present generation is excited about online courses. Not all courses can be taught in online mode. Colleges have to identify subjects that can be taught by chalk and talk, assignments, online etc. and deliver accordingly,” the VC said. A mentoring system with a teacher turning into guide will be in place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/engg-students-to-pursue-3internships-from-2021-22/articleshow/86351645.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas

The insurer had earlier declined to refund the woman her entire medical expenses citing that she had opted for a different kind of surgery. B Shashirekha of Jayanagar 3rd Block has been holding a mediclaim policy with the Oriental Insurance Company Limited for 20 years and had last paid a premium of Rs 35,759 for policy validity till the end of 2020. On March 11, 2019, the senior citizen underwent a cataract surgery in her right eye on doctors’ advice. She spent Rs 88,772, but when she claimed a refund through her medical insurance she was only given Rs 32,000.  She questioned the decision of the insurer only to be told that an additional Rs 5,772 will be paid and not any more.  An infuriated Shashirekha contacted the officials of the insurance company stating that even for a cataract surgery in her left eye a few months earlier, which cost her Rs 68,900, she had received a similar response. She was told that she had opted a particular kind of lens surgery that was not permitted as per insurance terms. With the company not willing to budge, the elderly woman approached the Bengaluru Rural and Urban 1st Additional District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum in Shantinagar in October 2020 with a complaint against the insurance firm accusing it of unfair trade practices. In the 10-month-old litigation, Shashirekha’s lawyer presented the case, while the insurance company remained absent.  In their order pronounced on August 25, 2021, the judges noted that a qualified medical professional suggested the eye surgeries and an insurance firm can’t dictate what surgery the client must undergo. In Shashirekha’s case, no insurance document shows any restrictions and the opposite party’s act amounts to unfair trade practice, they added. The judges ruled that the company must pay the remaining mediclaim sum of Rs 36,900 towards the complainant’s left eye surgery and Rs 56,772 towards her right eye surgery, with interest. Taking into account the elderly woman being forced into court proceedings, the judges ordered the insurer must also pay Rs 25,000 for harassing her and causing agony and hardship and an additional Rs 10,000 towards her litigation expenses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/firm-told-to-refund-womans-93k-eye-surgery-bills/articleshow/86351643.cms||Petlee Peter

The gang hid the stolen money in a milk can and buried it in a farm field near Sira in Tumakuru district. Police recovered Rs 24.3 lakh from Bhavani Singh, Sunil, Ashuram Gujar and Kishore Singh. Police said the suspects are part of the gang which committed offences in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. They specialise in stealing huge sums of cash from shops, residences and business establishments, especially on the highways. The gang has members from Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. Bhavani allegedly led the team that stole cash from Ambika Textiles Sales Corporation on DK Lane, Chickpet. The gang of four entered the textile shop at night and fled with Rs 25 lakh. Police registered a case based on a complaint filed by shop owner Shankar Lal Solanki, who had kept the week’s collection in the shop as he was unable to deposit it in the bank. Cops suspected the involvement of Bhavani and Sunil, who were arrested in a similar case in February and released on bail, and zeroed in on them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bichu-gang-held-for-stealing-25l-from-shop/articleshow/86351675.cms||---

The division bench of Justice Ritu Bahri and Justice Arun Monga issued the order while setting aside a Ludhiana family court's refusal to grant divorce by mutual consent to a couple who had got married when the wife was a minor. The family court had ruled that the couple's marriage was not valid in the first place as the wife was younger than 18 at the time of nuptials. "Since the respondent wife was 17 years, 6 months and 8 days old at the time of marriage, and for all intents and purposes no petition was filed for declaration of her marriage as void by the wife, the petition for divorce under Section 13-B of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, should have been allowed," the high court said. After recording the statements of both parties, the bench granted them divorce by mutual consent. The couple from Ludhiana had got married on February 27, 2009 - the man was around 23 at the time - and had a child on January 31, 2010. The couple filed a petition for dissolution of their marriage before the Ludhiana family court on June 22 last year. While dismissing the plea, the family court cited Section 5(iii) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, which requires the bride to be 18 or above for union to be considered legally valid. The high court observed that the family court had wrongly dismissed the petition by referring to the Madras HC judgment about both parties being required to get their marriage nullified as per Section 13(2)(iv) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. A petition for nullity under Section 13(2)(iv) could be filed if the girl had got married at the age of 15, and she then filed a petition for dissolution of marriage before turning 18, according to the judgments of the Madras and Delhi high courts. In this case, since the girl was just over 17 years old at the time of the wedding, and she did not file a petition to get her marriage declared void on attaining the age of majority, the plea for dissolution of marriage by mutual consent should have been allowed by the family court, the high court held.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/marriage-valid-if-minor-doesnt-call-it-void-at-18-hc/articleshow/86352662.cms||Ajay Sura

---||Delhi||Comics are happy to return to live stand-up comedy gigs||After live streaming from home for almost over a year now, comedians are happy to tickle the audiences’ funny-bones in person – from a distance, of course! It’s not just the funny men and women who missed the energy of live performances, but even their spectators. But can the laughter get lost in translation through masks and has the pandemic changed comedy in any way? We speak to a few comedians to understand how it feels to perform on stage again. ‘Not concerned about cooker ki seeti or kutte ki awaaz when performing live vs at home’Neeti Palta, who recently returned to Delhi after doing housefull shows in Gujarat, puts it this way – “When you are standing backstage, about to go in front of the audience, and then the music plays and you step on to the stage to a thunderous welcome... that feeling is unparalleled. In comparison, when you perform from home, all you do is press a button. Besides, when I’m performing live, I am not worried about the mixer ka sound, cooker ki seeti or kutte ki awaaz.” She adds, “I could feel that energy in the auditorium. It was like we have made it this far and we are in this together, so let’s do this. We all have come this far now and we are here to enjoy.” Nishant TanwarTalking about why comedians don’t really enjoy live streamed performances as much, Nishant Tanwar says, “Log baniyan mein baithe hai! Koi kitchen mein khana bana raha hai, koi kha raha hai. Somebody’s network is gone and when he comes back, others are laughing and he is wondering what happened.” Tandon also cracked jokes about his experience during live streaming during a recent gig. He said that viewers behave as if they are watching TV, and forget that they are visible too. “Nahi bhai teri side bhi camera on hai!” he quipped. ‘With the audience in masks, you may miss the half-smiles and smirks, but not laughter’ You may assume that it would be difficult for comedians to ‘read the audience’ because of their masks. However, comics say that isn’t so, as they can hear their laughter. Nishant Tanwar who has been travelling for shows and has several performances lined up, says, “You may miss the half-smiles, smirks and grins, but most of the time the reaction is laughter. They also do the talking through their eyes or lean forward while laughing.” Talking about the COVID security measures in place during shows, Tandon says, “Most of the audience is vaccinated, while performers have also received both doses. Organisers are ensuring that COVID protocols are followed.” Many comics are refusing requests for selfies. Maheep Singh, who has been doing a lot of shows in NCR, points out, “In pubs especially, once the performance is over, everybody just comes towards the stage and wants a selfie with you. How can you take a selfie without removing your mask? Everybody removes masks to take pictures, so I’m quite apprehensive about it.” What are live stand-up comedy shows like in the new normal?‘Exploring the lighter side of the pandemic’Srishti Thakkar, who recently attended a show says, “It was great to hear all those jokes on COVID and vaccines. From going on crash diets during lockdown to knowing people who even see the positive side of COVID, the jokes were so relatable.” Stand-up comics are making the most of pandemic-relatedmaterial, some also find it amusing that even couples are forced to sit apart during shows due to the 50% capacity rule at venues. Tanwar says, “I have performed at multiples venues in different cities where even married couples were sitting apart”, while Neeti quips, “The husbands and wives must be very happy for all that time apart. They must be like – Chalo, ab government rule hai, what can we do?!” But are live streams here to stay?As far as venues are concerned, in recent weeks, restaurants have become the most common place where the shows are hosted. Maheep says, “Several restaurants in Noida, Delhi and Gurgaon now host these shows. Kahin plate gir rahi hai, kahin cutlery ki awaaz hai, kahin order de rahe hai. Then, as it is a restaurant, guests are not wearing masks. But all this is not up to a performer, it’s the organiser who has to ensure that there is enough space between the stage and guests, and that social distancing is maintained.” While a number of comedy clubs were closed in the pandemic, some have now started scheduling shows. So, will there be more shows amidst the third wave concerns? Neeti says, “The comedy club scene is getting better. Dekho ji, man proposes, God disposes. We are proposing this, and we will see...” Still, stand-up comedians say that live streamed shows may just be here to stay. Tanwar explains,“Corporates have now discovered that they can invite a stand-up comic and organise the show for their employees without any physical arrangements. Plus, it is cost-effective, as they don’t have to bear hotel and travel expenses.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/comics-are-happy-to-return-to-live-stand-up-comedy-gigs/articleshow/86346356.cms||Niharika Lal

Both pilots managed to eject from the plane before it crashed in Lake Worth, which is just west of Fort Worth, authorities said at a news conference.  "This incident could have been much worse," Lake Worth fire chief Ryan Arthur said of the crash, which authorities were alerted to shortly before 11 am.  Police Chief JT Manoushagian said one pilot's parachute got tangled in power lines and that both were being treated for injuries.  He said the people who live in the three damaged homes will be displaced because of the crash.  The neighborhood is located near the Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base.

---||India||Punjab: Congress replaces Captain, but will it win the test?||NEW DELHI: Clinching the political process in Punjab within two days by putting a Dalit in the chief minister's post is a bold move that will face the test of ousted chief minister Amarinder Singh's angst and whether a "stop gap" choice can help prepare Congress for the assembly elections next year. Once the dust settles over the political drama, Congress would be looking to ensure, and also hoping, that this reshuffle puts an end to the chaos of the past few months and readies the party for the polls and the dramatic changes amid most MLAs playing along deliver its anticipated results. The challenge before Congress now is to make sure that peace within takes roots while it is able to show that governance is filling the gaps that party MLAs identified during their attacks on Amarinder Singh. The state Congress remains a hub of conflicting egoes and searing ambitions, and it would be up to chief Navjot Sidhu to put the house in order. At least one aspirant has threatened to quit the party though his credentials are weak. A key challenge for the individualistic PCC chief would be to accommodate Amarinder loyalists or those who sided with the fallen satrap during the recent clash - a tough task given that the temptation would be to marginalise them and settle scores. Any return of bickering, party leaders believe, will negate the positive effect of ending the crisis with political points of a Dalit CM. "There is no doubt that Captain was one of the tallest CMs of Punjab. But he did lose the confidence of the MLAs. It is not easy to reconcile these contradictions. If everyone pulls together, the party will be able to deal with the situation quickly," said Congress Rajya Sabha MP Abhisekh Singhvi. Even more critical for Congress would be to ensure that Amarinder Singh does not turn into a persistently hostile figure. A seething Singh can tap into any negative that comes up in future, and put the Congress in a spot. However, party sources said the mood within is not to go beyond a point to appease Singh. As of now though, Amarinder is not drawing fine lines, convinced that the Gandhi siblings ousted him. A weakened and fractious Congress, it is feared, may not enthuse voters and open space for AAP, making the election multi-cornered, and creating difficult coalition scenarios. By picking a Dalit to be the CM, Congress has gambled that it's new mascot Sidhu can balance the political field by wooing his dominant Jat Sikh community, and will preempt any backlash from the group that is used to the top post. At the same time, the party will have to be careful of not giving out the impression that Charanjit Singh Channi is only doing a holding job for Sidhu, which can turn the new appointment into tokenism and negate the potential advantage. These challenges make the coming weeks and months critical for Congress where it would be required to do the balancing act on various fronts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/punjab-congress-replaces-captain-but-will-it-win-the-test/articleshow/86353856.cms||---

---||India||After day of drama, Channi is Punjab’s first Dalit Sikh CM||CHANDIGARH: Punjab got its first Dalit Sikh CM in Charanjit Singh Channi on Sunday as Congress ended a day of back-and-forth over Captain Amarinder Singh's successor with a surprise pick it claimed was the "unanimous choice", including that of the original contender and PCC president Navjot Singh Sidhu. Channi, among the cabinet quartet who had declared they had lost confidence in Amarinder's leadership, made the cut even as colleague Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa was being talked about as Congress's best bet once the party's Hindu face, Sunil Jakhar, found himself out of the race. AICC's Punjab minder Harish Rawat indicated that the party was likely to appoint two deputy CMs. Brahm Mohindra, a Hindu face, and Randhawa, a Jat Sikh face, are the top contenders, sources said. Read AlsoA ‘turbaned Dalit’, Channi ticked all right boxes for CongWhen the names of Sunil Jakhar, Ambika Soni, Sukhjinder Randhawa were being discussed as possible replacements for Amarinder Singh, they represented politically important social groups like non-Sikh, Punjabi Hindu and Jatt Sikh communities. It was during the calculations on the pros and cons ofChanni, the 58-year-old three-time MLA from Chamkaur Sahib, had been hoping for the deputy CM's post at best, sources said. Sidhu had positioned himself as the frontrunner for the chief ministership if Congress opted for a Jat Sikh - a point he put across forcefully during his meeting with the AICC panel - to replace Amarinder. The latter quit on Saturday, citing repeated "humiliation" by the central leadership. Apart from the Dalit factor, what swung the pendulum Channi's way was Sidhu and Congress veteran Ambika Soni backing him, sources said. The decision to pick Channi is seen as an attempt by Congress to outsmart rival parties trying to woo Dalit voters.

When the observers subsequently decided to speak to around 70% of the party MLAs over the phone for their feedback, Randhawa and Jakhar emerged as the top contenders.

The country reported over 2.14 lakh new cases in the week (September 13-19), down from 2.51 lakh in the previous seven days. This was the lowest number of cases reported in 27 weeks since March 8-14 (for weeks ending Sunday). This was the second consecutive week of a substantial decline in Covid numbers. Last week, cases in the country had seen a 13% drop, while in the previous seven days, numbers were mainly flat with a drop of just 0.6%. The sharp fall in infections were mainly due to numbers dropping in Kerala, which still accounted for 62% of all cases in the country during the week. Kerala reported 1.33 lakh fresh cases, a drop of 20.6% from the previous week's tally of over 1.67 lakh. Two week earlier, Kerala's weekly case count had crossed 2 lakh, as the latest wave of the pandemic in the state peaked. Cases continued to decline in Maharashtra while Mizoram and Tamil Nadu registered a rise in infections during the week. India recorded 2,315 deaths from the virus in the week, a 10% increase from the previous week's toll of 2,104. Meanwhile, on Sunday, India reported 30,814 fresh cases, nearly the same as the number on the previous day (31,242), as Kerala logged 19,653 new infections. The state had recorded 19,352 cases the previous day. There were 295 deaths from the virus, with Kerala reporting 152 fatalities, Maharashtra 49, Tamil Nadu 27, Karnataka 16 and Bengal 11.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/indias-weekly-covid-19-cases-drop-15-lowest-in-6-months/articleshow/86354722.cms||Amit Bhattacharya

These new varieties of 16 different crops seek to reduce malnutrition as they are a source of staple diet rich in micronutrients, agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar said on Sunday. Developed by institutions under the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, these are 1.5 to 3 times more nutritious than the traditional varieties. Similarly, the hybrid maize varieties are enriched with lysine and tryptophan, the finger varieties of millet (CFMV 1 and 2) are rich in calcium, iron and zinc and small millet (CCLMV1) variety is rich in iron and zinc. The list also includes new varieties of mustard and peanuts. The addition of the 17 new varieties has taken the list of such biofortified types to 71. It includes 22 varieties of wheat, followed by 11 of maize, eight of pearl millet, seven of rice and three each of finger millet, mustard and soybean. Addressing the G20 agriculture ministers' meet, Tomar spoke about making India as a destination of healthy food and appealed to the participating nations to support the celebration of 2023 as 'International Millet Year' to promote nutrition and sustainable agriculture even as India has been taking multiple efforts to promote cultivation of such crops. In order to promote use of these biofortified varieties, the government plans to link them with several programmes — Mid-Day Meal and Anganwadi — to make India free from malnutrition at a time when the country is estimated to have 15.2% of its population which is undernourished.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rice-with-zinc-wheat-with-protein-to-fight-malnutrition/articleshow/86354849.cms||Vishwa Mohan

---||Bhubaneswar||Crash probe training for officers involved in road safety work||BHUBANESWAR: The government will train officials tasked with ensuring safety of people on roads in proper crash investigation. The training will focus on ways to ascertain the exact causes of accidents, corrective measures and effective monitoring. The manual collection of data under the road accident management information system (RAMIS), which is being developed to inspect the accident spots, showed that in about 80% cases rash and negligent driving was cited as the cause of the accident. This finding could be faulty. According to the official proceedings of the state commerce and transport department, the training will help the assistant motor vehicle inspectors (MVIs), junior MVIs, police officials, junior road engineers and assistant engineers properly investigate the accident spots. A meeting was recently held by chief secretary Suresh Mohapatra in this regard. Though the Supreme Court committee on road safety has asked the states to get the accident spots inspected jointly by the MVIs, police and road engineers, Odisha is yet to comply with it. This led to transport secretary Madhu Sudan Padhi recently asking the district collectors, superintendents of police and regional transport officers to strictly comply with the directive of the SC committee. The proceedings brought to the fore the poor enforcement of driving license (DL) suspension law in the state. The SC committee had called for strict action against traffic rule violators and cent per cent suspension of offenders’ DLs. However, the enforcement authorities suspended the DL of only 7.64% of the violators for speeding beyond the permissible limit, 23.55% for drink driving, 9.06% for using mobile phones while driving and six per cent for riding two-wheelers without helmets, between January and June this year. “We have also asked the various road-owning authorities to reassess the traffic-calming measures taken at 8,102 accident-prone junctions in the state. Though the traffic-calming measures were completed at all the junctions, the road accident data revealed that about 27% of the fatalities occurred at these intersections last year, which is a matter of concern,” Padhi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/crash-probe-training-for-officers-involved-in-road-safety-work/articleshow/86351134.cms||Debabrata Mohapatra

On September 8, the HC had directed the Kalahandi SP to proceed against the IO concerned for non-compliance of this court’s order and submit a report to this court by the next date (September 17) and also cause production of the case diary positively. The HC had issued the direction after the state counsel informed that in spite of several communications, the I O of Jaipatna P.S. is not sending the case diary. The case diary was sought in connection with an anticipatory bail petition filed on July 28. But when the matter came up on Friday the single bench of Justice S Pujahari found that neither the case diary had been produced nor any report with regard to the action taken against the IO in the case had been received. Taking serious note of it Justice Pujahari issued notice to the S P, Kalahandi to show cause as to why appropriate contempt shall not be initiated against him for non-compliance of the Courts order dated 8th September, 2021||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/cuttack/hc-fines-probe-officer-50k-for-not-producing-case-diary/articleshow/86351118.cms||lalmohan.patnaik

A month back, the active case count was 3,292, which has now gone up to 3,778, a rise of 486. The city reported 218 new cases on Sunday against 176 recoveries. Experts said urban conglomeration, lifestyle and flow of people to the city from other parts of the state are leading to the capital’s Covid caseload. Civic body officials said it is not that the daily infection among Bhubaneswar residents is high. People from neighbouring districts and other places also get themselves tested here and as a result the compiled data reflect a big jump. Officials said residents of Bhubaneswar shouldn’t be blamed alone for the daily infection rise. Dr E Venkata Rao of Sum Hospital, who was involved in the clinical trial of Covaxin, said the city is testing more and so positive cases are also showing a rise. “It is not that places which are not reporting cases now or are reporting a few cases have brought the infection down. It may so happen that if testing number increases there, we may get more positive cases in those places as well. In Bhubaneswar, we have a different culture, pattern of social interaction, offices, food joints and other facilities that lead to inadvertent compromise of distancing between people, resulting in spread of infection,” Rao observed. “We need to have data on how many of the new infections are symptomatic cases,” he added. The state reported 623 new cases from 62,917 samples tested registering a test positivity rate of 0.99%. Four districts didn’t report a single new infection while Nuapada district with only 8 active cases is at the bottom. The state reported seven more Covid deaths, taking the toll to 8,135.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/capitals-active-ve-cases-up-by-nearly-500-in-last-30-days/articleshow/86351125.cms||---
---||Cuttack||Orissa high court poser on tenure of contractual workers||CUTTACK: The Orissa high court has held that the state government should not keep an employee on contractual, temporary or ad hoc status for a long period. The high court said the government should not exploit its employees nor should it seek to take advantage of the helplessness and misery of either the unemployed persons or the employees, as the case may be. The observation came in a recent judgment in the case of 48 data entry operators who were appointed on contract in various tehsils of Cuttack district after undergoing a due selection process in 2008. On completion of six years of contractual service, it was extended periodically instead of regularization, even as those in somewhat similar positions were regularized in other departments. “When services of similarly situated persons have been regularized in other departments, the petitioners cannot be deprived of such benefit on the caprice and whims of the authority concerned and such action of the state and its instrumentalities cannot sustain in the eye of law,” Justice Sarangi ruled. He added, “Since the petitioners have already rendered more than 6 years of service, they are deemed to be regularized.” Citing Supreme Court rulings, Justice Sarangi stated, “Otherwise also they have completed 10 years of service, having been appointed by the authorities against sanctioned posts by following due process of selection, and continued by them voluntarily, their services are to be regularized.” Accordingly, the high court directed the state government to regularize the services of the petitioners and grant them all consequential service and financial benefits in accordance with law as expeditiously as possible, preferably within a period of two months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/cuttack/hc-poser-on-tenure-of-contractual-workers/articleshow/86351136.cms||lalmohan.patnaik

---||Bhubaneswar||Odisha: Kids complain of eye problems, headache||BHUBANESWAR: With in-person classes for all in schools across Odisha yet to be resumed, children, as young as five to six years of age, have started complaining of headache and eye problems owing to prolonged screen time and lack of physical activities during the pandemic. “My seven-year-old son has been complaining of getting a headache every evening. Initially, I thought he was malingering, but later I realised he is really ill. I took him to the doctor who said it is due to spending long hours before the screen. He advised rest for eyes and to limit the screen time to one to two hours a day. But with restricted screen time, my son will miss many classes as all of them are being conducted online,” said a worried Shipra Mohanty. Mohanty said her son, Aditya, a Class 2 student, starts his day with a two-hour online class at 7am. His activity classes continue from 11am to noon. He then attends art/chess/music classes online in the afternoon for two hours, followed by a virtual tuition. During the breaks, he plays for over an hour on mobile and watches TV. Doctors said many children have started complaining of headache, neck pain, loss of appetite, dizziness and vomiting amid the pandemic. Four out of 10 children are suffering from different types of headaches. Sedentary lifestyle, lack of social interactions, excessive screen time and junk food are some of the most common reasons for headache among youngsters. “They need adequate sleep, a healthy diet, proper dehydration, physical exercise and relaxation,” said Dr SS Mohapatra, a senior paediatrician. According to the World Health Organization, for children up to five years, screen time should not be more than an hour. Kids between 5 and 10 years should have screen time between one to 1.5 hours per day, while it should be up to two hours daily for those aged between 11 and 13. Sometimes pressure on eyes, leading to myopia, causes headache, doctors said. “Excessive use of digital devices is causing computer digital syndrome. Many teenagers and children are being diagnosed with it. Parents need to visit an ophthalmologist as soon as their kid complains of headache, neck pain or pain in the eyes,” said Dr Rita Das, an eye-specialist at AMRI Hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/kids-complain-of-eye-problems-headache/articleshow/86352159.cms||Minati Singha

Seven top mining and metal platers including the JSPL, Essel Mining, Tata, Rungta, MSPL, ArcelorMittal and Electrosteel were in the race for the iron ore block. Sources said the JSPL won the block by committing to pay a premium of 118.1%, which means that it will have to shell out Rs 118 to the state government for the sale/transaction of every Rs 100 of iron ore from the block. The reserve, spread over 194.19 hectares, was operated by Essel Mining of Aditya Birla group until March 2020. With the recent amendment in the mining auction rules, the successful bidder (JSPL in this case) may not have to seek fresh environment clearance for the block. The iron ore block will cater to the raw material needs of the JSPL’s 6MTPA steel plant in Angul.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/jspl-bags-kasia-block-will-pay-govt-118-for-every-100-of-iron-ore-sale/articleshow/86352164.cms||Debabrata Mohapatra

Police seized nine cars, 14 two-wheelers, a DJ set, lights and beer bottles from the spot. According to police, there's no provision to organise such parties due to the prevailing Covid-19 situation. Ashitosh from Himachal Pradesh and Pranab from Kerala were the main organisers. Students, techies and private firm employees were among the participants. Police said the organisers used social media to contact them. They would reveal the details to only those who showed interest in participating and paid an entry fee. Based on a tip-off about the party that was under way last Saturday night, police reached the resort at 12.30am. Several partygoers took to their heels and cops managed to nab 37 of them. The resort belongs to a man identified as Srinivas. Police have written to the Anekal tahsildar to know whether the resort owner has necessary permissions from authorities or not. Action will be taken against Srinivas if he had rented out his premises to organise a party with prior knowledge. “We did not find any narcotics at the spot.

Chhotu is among eight children who have died following high fever in the last four days in Agra district. While this comes on the heels of UP's Firozabad district recording deaths of 61 people who had viral fever and dengue-like symptoms, Chhattisgarh has reported deaths of three children in one month. It's not just in UP and Chhattisgarh. While the country fights Covid-19 and braces for a possible third wave of the pandemic, doctors in many states across India are dealing with people afflicted with fever, and allied complications, due to causes other than Covid. States like Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Karnataka have also reported such cases. Most of these states have reported cases of dengue, scrub typhus, Japanese encephalitis, malaria, leptospirosis and typhoid, affecting mostly children. It began with news of a "mystery fever" killing children in several districts in western UP, prompting a team of doctors from Lucknow to visit Firozabad, Agra, Mathura and Aligarh. It found that D2 strain of the dengue virus was causing the fever and many deaths were attributed to scrub typhus-induced meningitis. In Chhattisgarh, the state government, worried over the deaths of children, has scrambled a team of paediatricians to Koriya district where more than 80 children are hospitalised with fever, cough and cold. State health officials said the deaths were due to a combination of the fever and congenital diseases. In Bihar, government data shows around 7,000 children visited government health institutes with fever and other flu-related symptoms this month. So far, 15 have died. State health department special secretary Sanjay Kumar Singh said humid weather and receding flood water could be the reason for children falling ill. While there was a scare initially in neighbouring Jharkhand about a mystery fever afflicting people, it turned out to be Japanese encephalitis. "Viral fever and dengue cases have been reported among children in Karnataka. But there have been no deaths," said Dr KS Sanjay, director, Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Health, Bengaluru. The government-run Children's Hospital, which gets referral cases from across the state, has seen 40 cases of dengue in the last two months. While Uttarakhand government denied reports of any cases of scrub typhus surfacing, sources in the health department confirmed the presence of such cases from a few districts in August and September. In Madhya Pradesh, over 2,500 dengue cases have been detected since July. Districts of north MP, which share their borders with UP, are on alert. However, in Bengal, health officials are still foxed, with more than 100 children affected by a mystery fever in north Bengal earlier this week. Five deaths have been reported so far. While the cause of the fever remains unknown, none of the affected has tested positive for Covid or dengue.

---||India||Breaking all barriers, Channi’s rise big in terms of symbolism||NEW DELHI: For all the politicking involved in the Punjab power play, the nomination of Charanjit Channi as chief minister breaks more than a few glass ceilings and social and political barriers. For the first time post-Independence, the state with the highest ratio of Dalit population (32%) has got a CM from the underprivileged community. In terms of symbolism, it does not get bigger. No political party has managed to jettison the Jatt Sikh domination in the state despite their population being only around equal to other social groups like OBCs and Dalits. In the last four decades, the bipolarity between Akali Dal and Congress ensured that they reigned supreme. The Congress decision to pick Channi ahead of many other, even stronger, candidates betrays a calculation driven by politics in view of coming polls. A mainstream political party, that too national, has crossed the Rubicon. Such decisions have till now not happened because they carry the risk of a backlash from the dominant groups. There is also the question of the credibility of the choice in view of a short run till elections and Channi having been in a few avoidable controversies. Terming the selection of Channi as "significant", veteran JNU sociologist Surinder Jodhka said, "Everybody is thinking in terms of identities now. The way Akali Dal has tied up with BSP, and BJP has been trying to win over Dalits.... It shows how the Dalit constituency has become autonomous. This is what democracy has done." He attributed the choice of CM to courage of the Congress party to go beyond symbolism. Giani Zail Singh was the last non-Jatt CM in Punjab, and he was from the artisan OBC community. And that was in the 1970s. The idea of a Dalit CM in Punjab has been so improbable that Akali Dal has promised to make a Dalit as deputy CM if voted to power.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/breaking-all-barriers-channis-rise-big-in-terms-of-symbolism/articleshow/86355388.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal

The boy, Jyoti Behera, a resident of Dhipisahi at Baramunda here, had gone to Shatabdi Nagar for tuition. He has been missing since 2 in the afternoon. Fire personnel, police and those from the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) had been trying to rescue him till the filing of this report. They could manage to find his bicycle, which was stuck in a corner of the drain. “Water was flowing on the road connecting the mouth of the drain number 8 at Shatabdi Nagar. The boy was perhaps caught unawares while passing the mouth of the drain. He must have slipped into it and the current may have pushed him deep inside the drain. The drain is covered up to Gandamunda,” said assistant fire officer Sushant Kumar Biswal. He added that in four hours of operation they have been able to fish out the bicycle. “We have handed over the bicycle to the family members. We have not found any other belongings. We are facing difficulty in entering the drain as it is covered and water is overflowing. We are keeping a watch and have suspended the operation temporarily,” Biswal added. BMC additional commissioner Laxmikanta Sethi said the incident took place in ward 51. “Rescue operation is on. Because of the high intensity of storm water, drains are overflowing. Every possible way is being explored to rescue the boy,” said Sethi. The city’s drainage system and poor storm water management had claimed two lives in the past. In September 2011, a two-year-old boy slipped into the drain while playing nearby his home at VSS Nagar. Fire fighters took two hours to fish out the body.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/boy-missing-after-falling-into-open-drain-in-city/articleshow/86353077.cms||Riyan Ramanath V

The move is to create awareness about family planning at the community level. Various activities will be organised on this day at all the health units to promote fertility awareness based methods and contraception. “Under this initiative, cases of unwanted pregnancies, maternal mortality, neonatal mortality and complications related to child birth can be reduced. With awareness and acceptance of family planning among the people, the health workers will be able to reduce the number of unsafe abortions in the state. Special attention will be given to target groups like women who have been identified as having a high-risk pregnancy and newly married couples,” Pandey said. “Decline in maternal and infant mortality and prevention from HIV infection would like to boost women empowerment as well as help in social and economic development of women,” he added. Pandey said if the interested couple chooses any one of the family planning options on September 21, then all arrangements will be made to provide them facilities. “To ensure the successful implementation of the Family Planning Day, preparations have been completed in the districts. Similarly, under the Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan, arrangements for counselling of pregnant women will be ensured at all health facilities on the 9th of every month. The women and their families coming for ANC (antenatal care) check-ups will be made aware of the family planning-related measures,” the minister said.

The Asiatic lions were being brought to Rajgir from the Sakkarbaug zoological park, Junagadh, Gujarat, in exchange of other animals from Bihar-based zoo. Sources in the Bihar’s environment, forest & climate change department said as soon as the forest officials’ motorcade, comprising four cars and two big trucks, approached the UP-Bihar interstate border check post near Mohania around 3am on Sunday, the prohibition officials stopped the vehicles to check them. The India-made foreign liquor (IMFL) is generally smuggled into Bihar through this road route. As their motorcade was stopped, the forest officials led by the Rajgir zoo safari’s deputy director Ambika Sharan Sinha, showed their identity cards, the animal transit permit and other necessary papers issued by the Central Zoo Authority to the prohibition officials and requested them to allow the vehicles carrying Asiatic lions to start their onwards journey for Rajgir, so that the animals could reach the zoo safari within the stipulated time frame. However, the prohibition officials insisted on conducting thorough check of the vehicles. The forest officials refused to allow checking of trucks on the plea that it would disturb the animals. “We somehow managed to come out of the check post after being halted for more than one hour,” a forest official told TOI over phone. He said all the six lions were safely carried to the Rajgir zoo safari. Dev Vrat Kumar, an excise inspector posted at Mohania check post, said the vehicles were stopped as part of their duty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/vehicle-checkexcise-forest-officials-spar/articleshow/86349771.cms||Madan Kumar

---||Patna||Bihar transport department to hike bus fares by five to 20%||PATNA: The state transport department has decided to increase the bus fares by 5-20% on requests from private bus operators following the spike in fuel prices and its cascading effects on other commodities. The department has released the draft proposal of the revised fare for private and government buses on its official website. The new rates are likely be implemented in the next 30 days after a mutual agreement among the stakeholders. The new rates have been fixed under sub-section (1) of Section 67 of the Motor Vehicles Act 1988. The department has proposed Rs1.50 hike per km for general buses, Rs1.70/km for deluxe buses, Rs2/km for deluxe AC buses and Rs2.50/km for Volvo, Mercedes and its equivalent buses and Rs6.4 for the first 4 kms and Rs3 for the next 2 kms for city buses. Transport secretary Sanjay Kumar Agarwal said the fare has been revised after 3 years in the interest of the operators and the public as the department received several complaints that the bus operators were charging exorbitant fares from commuters. “Besides, the bus operators were also demanding increase in fare due to the rise in fuel prices,” he said. The department has also decided to revise the bus fare every six months depending on the rise and fall in petrol and diesel prices, he said. Agarwal told this newspaper on Sunday that it would be better if they update the bus fare twice a year to control the excess fare charged by the bus operators. “We will also update the fare at every bus stand to make commuters people would also become aware,” the secretary said. The last bus fare revision happened in 2018 when petrol was Rs81.04-Rs85.01 per litre and the diesel was Rs72.05- Rs78 per litre between June and October. The petrol is now being sold at Rs104.01/litre whereas the diesel price stood at Rs94.76/litre in the state capital on Sunday. Uday Shankar Singh, president of Bihar Motor Transport Federation (BMTF), said with revised rates, most of the bus operators will be in no profit and no loss situation. “The new rates will not have much influence on our revenue, but at least we will not face losses,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/transport-dept-to-up-bus-fares-by-five-to-20/articleshow/86349894.cms||Faryal Rumi

YSRC nominees also won 17 out of 19 MPTCs in Kuppam mandal and over 97% of MPTCs in the other three mandals in Kuppam constituency. TDP candidate Gangadharam was trounced by YSRC candidate in the MPTC election in Naravaripalle, the home town of Naidu. YSRC candidates swept the village polls in Kuppam constituency, the fortress of Chandrababu Naidu for over three decades. YSRC-backed candidates had created ripples when they won 75 of 89 village panchayats in the elections in February. YSRC further improved its tally in April as it won 62 of the 65 MPTCs. TDP could not secure a double-digit score in the MPTC elections. According to reports, YSRC candidates won 17 of 19 MPTCs in Kuppam mandal leaving TDP with just two. YSRC nominees captured all 12 MPTCs in Gudipalle mandal and 16 MPTCs in Rama Kuppam mandal. Ruling party candidates secured 17 MPTCs of 18 in Santhipuram mandal.

However, the proposal has drawn sharp criticism from mayor Sunanda Palanetra, who has pointed out that such an action constitutes a violation of human rights. The drive was launched across the 65 wards falling under the jurisdiction of the MCC at the instance of the civic agency’s commissioner G Lakshmikantha Reddy.  The MCC commissioner pointed out that the civic agency is owed up to Rs 195 crore in dues from those yet to pay their water bill. “Some of the defaulters include commercial establishments and industries,” Reddy added. He said that, the mounting dues had left the MCC coping with a fiscal crisis, making it difficult to ensure regular supply of drinking water to all the residents. “This was what prompted us to undertake a drive to stop supply of drinking water to defaulters,” Reddy said. The MCC had compiled a list of defaulters in each of the 65 wards, he added. “In some cases, the MCC will initiate stringent action to enforce the rules. We are making all efforts to optimise revenue collection.” Reddy told TOI. Mayor Sunanda told TOI that the government could not refuse access to clean drinking water to its citizens. “Stopping water supply to residents is not right given that the elderly and children in the homes of defaulters will have to bear the brunt of it. I will direct the authorities to stop this drive, and we will discuss other ways to recover the dues from households, commercial establishments and industries at the upcoming MCC Council meeting,” Sunada said. Chandrakanth, an advocate, said that access to safe and clean drinking water was a fundamental right. “Right to drink clean water falls under the Right to Life that is guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution. Disconnection of water service for failure to pay bills is a violation of human rights,” Chandrakanth told TOI. Kuvempunagar resident K Gangadhar told TOI that the MCC must encourage the defaulters to pay the principal, and take the interest on instalment.  “The previous initiative had reduced the burden on defaulters. But a drive to stop supply of water is inhuman,” Gangadhar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/mccs-drive-to-stop-supply-of-water-to-defaulters-draws-flak/articleshow/86349693.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Ruling party sees in victories public support to welfare prog||Amaravati: Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy’s victory march in the electoral battles continues unchallenged with the ruling YSRC scoring a resounding victory in mandal and zilla parishad elections in the state. YSRC’s massive victories in the ZP elections has proved that the ruling party has further consolidated its base since the 2019 assembly elections. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s welfare mantra is reaping rich dividends for the party, leaving behind rival parties, including principal opposition TDP. “Jagan’s commitment to fulfilling the promises and bailing out the poor amid the Covid-19 pandemic despite facing serious financial troubles has made him tha favourite of commoners,” said party general secretary and government advisor Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy. Although the ZPTC and MPTC elections were held almost a year after issuance of notification and a long legal tussle, the TDP could not save face anywhere in the state. YSRC secured the panchayat, municipal, ZP and Tirupati Lok Sabha by-elections with resounding majorities. Interestingly, the chief minister did not campaign in any of the elections while TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu and his son Nara Lokesh campaigned in all elections. “Jagan is the only leader who is fulfilling every poll promise made before the elections. People have once again proved that they have complete faith in the leadership of Jagan,” said panchayat raj minister Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy. YSRC scored a landslide victory in urban local body elections by winning all 12 municipal corporations and 73 of 75 municipalities. Barring a couple of municipalities where the TDP put up a fight, other opposition parties such as Jana Sena and its ally BJP were wiped out. In fact, the results also point to the diminishing image of TDP as party candidates lost the elections in Naidu’s bastion Kuppam in Chittoor district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/ruling-party-sees-in-victories-public-support-to-welfare-prog/articleshow/86350410.cms||Samdani MN

The state government is already bearing the financial burden of the electricity charges of farmers, eligible SC/ST/MBC consumers, artisans and other category consumers. Thus, out of the total 1.86 crore consumers, 40 lakh consumers would benefit from the subsidies being provided by the state government. The Andhra Pradesh Electricity Regulatory commission (APERC) will organise the state advisory committee meeting on September 20. The meeting will focus on various components, including the reduction of cost of service, streamlining the power purchases, improvement of performance of the discoms, demand side management, and energy conservation and energy efficiency measures. APERC chairman justice CV Nagarjuna Reddy said the availability of reliable, quality and affordable power will help rapid agricultural and industrial growth in the state and spur overall economic development. “APERC and power utilities should work in tandem to reach the future goals and challenges. The APERC will keep consumers’ interests in mind while making every decision,” said Justice Nagarjuna Reddy. “Protecting the consumers and strengthening the power utilities are the twin objectives of the commission. The APERC is making every effort to be true to the regulatory role it has to play in the performance of its statutory functions and duties. As India’s power sector is undergoing a noteworthy change, the Commission wants the power utilities to strive to lead the state in the rapid growth of the power sector,” he said. According to the APERC officials, the Commission, for the first time, has approved Rs 1,657 crore towards extending the direct benefit to eligible consumers as promised by the government. It has been done to make the process of passing the government promised benefits to eligible consumers in a hassle free manner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/govt-to-bear-true-up-charges-of-40l-customers/articleshow/86350606.cms||---

For instance: Ahmedabad-based sampling and management platform for direct to consumer (D2C) brands Smytten raised about Rs 44.4 crore in August. The startup intends to utilize the fresh investment primarily for scaling up its user base and building many industry-first tech and data solutions. Another startup from the city Big Spoon Foods raised Rs 15 crore in a pre-Series A round of funding last month. The cloud kitchen startup will use the funds for market expansion, hiring and product development. The startup had also bagged Rs 15 crore funding last year. Incorporated in October 2020, edtech startup Orphicy recently obtained Rs 2.5 crore funding at a valuation of Rs 25 crore. This startup from Ahmedabad has received funds from NRI tech enthusiasts presently working in leadership positions at Facebook, Google, McKinsey. Agritech startup InfyU Labs recently raised Rs 1.8 crore in a seed round led by Angel Indian Network. In June, edtech startup Saarthi Pedagogy raised Rs 7 crore from Ecosystem Ventures and other investors. Similarly, LearnVern, another edtech startup from Ahmedabad, also received funding to the tune of Rs 7.3 crore from international investors in April this year. During the same month, Vadodara-based IEI Didactics received Rs 22.25 lakh from HDFC Bank’s SmartUp Grants. “Contrary to the perceived belief, funding for startups has seen a healthy growth over the last year. Despite the overall subdued global macro economy, Indian start-ups have managed to raise funds in a sustained manner,” said Dr. Sunil Shukla, director general, Entrepreneurship Development Institute of India (EDII), Ahmedabad. “The onset of Covid-19 pandemic saw the inception of several solution-oriented enterprises that are hi-tech and highly relevant in the present times,” he added. According to experts, startups raising more funds is a function of a maturing startup ecosystem in Gujarat. Explaining this, Anupam Jalote, CEO, International Centre for Entrepreneurship and Technology (iCreate), said, “Increasing number of investors are now seeing startup funding as a good avenue for investing their corpus, as startups reflect promising growth. The surge in the quantum of funds raised is also a reflection of a maturing ecosystem.” Jalote further explained that in the post-pandemic digital boom, a large chunk of tech startups such as providers of AI-driven solutions, fintech startups and even those in the electric vehicle segment are raking in the maximum funds followed by the other sectors.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/investors-back-guj-startups-7-get-rs-77cr-funding-in-fy22/articleshow/86351957.cms||Kalpesh Damor

---||Lucknow||No respite from potholes, vehicle owners bear the cost of Civic body’s apathy||Prayagraj: Even as the October 15 deadline set by chief minister Yogi Adityanath to ensure pothole-free roads across the state is fast approaching, roads dotted with craters continue to burn holes in the pockets of two-wheeler and car owners in the Sangam city. The condition of some of the roads including Tashkent marg, Tagore town road, Georgetown, roads near Manmohan Park, Old Katra, Netram Chauraha, Civil Lines bus stand, Rajapur trisection and adjoining areas are in such bad shape that a mishap seems inevitable. Moreover, the recent downpour and poor patch and repair work have compounded the woes of commuters. While chief minister Yogi Adityanath had cautioned officials of various departments to ensure quality work and even warned that complaints of irregularities will be dealt with severely, concerned development agencies are yet to initiate measures in the city. City-based physician Dr Anupam Dwivedi told TOI that the Tashkent marg was in the worst condition and driving had become next to impossible on this stretch. The road was widened for commuting and even after the construction of dividers months back, there was no beginning of road construction till now. The corporator and senior Congress leader Mukund Tiwari said that nearly two lakh vehicles ply on the roads in different parts of the city every day and over 40 per cent of the vehicles develop snags regularly, thanks to the crater and pothole-filled roads. Every month, hundreds of new vehicles hit the streets and these are also not spared from the fast decay due to bad road conditions. The poor condition of tabletops crossings also cause damages to vehicles’ suspensions. The cost of repairing these damages in most cases for SUVs and other expensive cars range from Rs 5,000 to Rs 15,000, and these are not even covered under the insurance policies. “Insurance can be claimed only when cars suffer damages in accidents. The cost of repairing luxury vehicles is spiralling up, but the damages cannot be insured,” said the owner of an automobile garage at Civil Lines adding that despite holding insurance policies, car owners have to shell out money for repairs." Apart from suspensions, ravaged roads wreak havoc on different car parts, especially axles, wheels and tyres. “The car’s alignment system suffers due to bad roads and it costs considerably to repair the cars even if the damages are minor," said a car owner who had to go for the repair of his vehicle.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/no-respite-from-potholes-vehicle-owners-bear-the-cost-of-civic-bodys-apathy/articleshow/86351286.cms||---

It was the last time the state had witnessed a single-digit daily Covid tally. Thus, it was a landmark day for the state on Sunday as Gujarat recorded eight cases in 24 hours — the feat achieved after over 500 days. The new positive cases included four from Surat city, two from Vadodara city, and one each from Vadodara and Valsad districts.

Out of 33, 16 districts have zero active cases. “It’s indeed a great news, and an encouraging one. But it doesn’t mean that we can relax and let our guards down.

At the same time passenger turnout in public transport, considered a gauge of vibrancy in social life, is increasing. “There is a small-but-steady increase in passenger turnout over the past two weeks. We expect that the numbers will further go up in the coming days,” said T Gopinanthan, general secretary, Kerala State Bus Operators Organization. Kochi Metro Rail Ltd (KMRL) is expecting more footfalls in the coming days. “We are operating only a few trains now and will increase their numbers based on the increase in footfalls. We are increasing sanitizing facilities and will also ensure social distance in the next few weeks,” said an official with KMRL. Authorities said they will put in place proper arrangements and precautions before reopening colleges and schools. “District disaster management authority (DDMA) will discuss all such issues. DDMA will set norms for reopening more sectors. Officials of many departments are members of DDMA. Then, such officials will be able to execute decisions pertaining to their areas,” said DMO Dr NK Kuttappan. Business community is expecting a positive change in a couple of months. “After Onam, business was dull. But, we hope that there will be a positive change once schools and colleges reopen,” said Mohammed Kamran, secretary, Ernakulam Merchants Union. “Then, the market will become vibrant for some time,” he said. At the same time, there are apprehensions over living in tandem with the new normal. “During the period where restrictions were issued to control the pandemic, our society acquired new habits. One of the major changes is the shift to online purchase. We are unsure how many consumers will return to shops even if all sectors reopen,” he said. Bus owners’ also were anxious about operating services amid new challenges. “Due to restrictions as part of Covid control, we are allowed to carry passengers as per our seating capacity. Once students start commuting, our revenue may further fall as their fares are low. We will have to limit the number of passengers to seating capacity. At the same time, we will have to carry students. It will see a fall in passenger traffic and subsequent dip in revenue,” Gopinathan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/hopes-and-concerns-rise-as-reopening-plans-unfurl/articleshow/86351674.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

Sujesh left home on Sunday morning in his car and has not returned home, said the complaint given by his brother Sunil Kannatt to Irinjalakuda police. His mobile was switched off after Sunday evening. The family filed a complaint on Monday as they thought Sujesh would have gone to some friend’s place and might return later by night. “He has not informed where he was going to anyone in the family, including his wife and mother,” said his father Krishnan Kannatt. Police said Sujesh’s last known tower location was in Kannur on Sunday night after he apparently switched on the mobile to access the internet. “He hasn’t switched on the mobile after that. Since he has taken the car, we assume we can get more information on his location by tracing the car,” said the CI of Irinjalakuda. Krishnan said Sujesh faced some threats when he had raised allegations about the involvement of some CPM leaders in the fraud at Karuvannur cooperative bank. “I don’t know whether he was facing threats recently,” he added. Sujesh, who was the Porathissery CPM branch secretary, had launched a solo protest demanding action against those involved in the fraud at the bank, on June 14. Subsequently, he was expelled from the party. However, he continued to expose corruption and had divulged critical information to the media on the fraud. A crime branch team probing the fraud have arrested nine persons, including the former president and CPM leader KK Divakaran. Probe by officials of the cooperative department had indicated that the CPM-ruled bank had incurred a loss of over Rs 100 crore due to the fraud.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/whistleblower-of-bank-fraud-reported-missing/articleshow/86351698.cms||T Ramavarman

---||Kochi||Disinfection service providers eye good business in Kochi||KOCHI: With the government planning to reopen schools, private players offering disinfection and sanitisation services in the city expect an increase in work orders. Many schools and colleges have started booking the services of such firms to prepare for the reopening. Moreover, these firms provide training to cleaning staff about the protocols and disinfection they have to follow once the schools start functioning. Many agencies are drafting customized disinfection packages to the schools ahead of the reopening. All the classrooms and other premises in the schools need to be sanitized. Moreover, once the schools are reopened, sanitation and disinfection need to be done on a regular basis and it will be a tedious task for school authorities.  Agencies offering such services have mushroomed since the pandemic and most of them are of high demand now. Agencies, which usually take quotation for cleaning homes and office spaces, are now upgrading their machines and technologies to meet the requirements of schools. Juby Paul, general secretary of Kochi Metro Sahodaya and principal of ToC-H Public School, Vyttila, said that the prime importance is given to ready the school for safe conduct of the classes. He said that most schools may have to seek the help of professional agencies, at least in the beginning stage, to get the disinfection done. Most agencies now offer three-step disinfection which includes ultra-low volume (ULV)-fogging treatment followed by a high-pressure steam treatment for the entire institute area including classrooms, washroom, and all indoor and outdoor areas. Moreover, schools are opting thermal fogging treatment (fumigation treatment) through which a dense fog treatment will be done especially in the outdoor areas. Sajeev S R, one of the partners of Clearsky Solutions, a disinfection service provider at Cheranalloor, said that they were preparing an action plan to approach school managements to get the contract. “We started our business two years ago and have been getting so many work orders from commercial spaces. As schools will be reopening now our focus is on getting orders from school in the city,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/disinfection-service-providers-eye-good-biz/articleshow/86351711.cms||Anantha Narayanan K

Candidates from different areas of Punjab and even Ganganagar, Rajasthan had come a day before the examination but were not allowed to enter. Jagtar, one of the protesters said, “Examination authorities did not issue any instructions about carrying a negative RT-PCR report. We were stopped from entering all of a sudden right before the examination. Now, our future is at stake. Who is responsible for this mess?” Other candidates slept on the road when the police tried to remove them from the roads. They also raised slogans against the sudden order mandating Covid test report.

---||Kochi||Kerala: Gamification for efficacy in online education||KOCHI: The National Service Scheme (NSS) of Vocational Higher Secondary Education (VHSE) explores the possibilities of gamification in teaching for online classes. NSS joins hands with Cochin University of Science and Technology (Cusat) to conduct a training programme for teachers in gamification. The decision has been taken considering the dire need for improving learner engagement of online classes in the state and the impact that gamification can create in achieving it. Manu Melwin Joy, assistant professor, School of Management Studies, Cusat, and a gamification expert, will provide management development programme on the topic ‘Gamification for Learning and Development’ for teachers. Joy has volunteered to conduct seven batches of three-day training programmes (more batches will be included as per the requirement) to VHSE teachers free of cost as a part of the CSR activity of the School of Management Studies. The official launch of the programme was held on Wednesday and Cusat pro-vice chancellor P G Sankaran inaugurated the training programme. Director of general education Jeevan Babu K released the training poster by handing it over to VHSE deputy director Anil Kumar T V, in the presence of NSS-VHSE project officer Santhosh Kumar V S, at DPI Headquarters, Thiruvananthapuram. “The pandemic threw life out of gear for everyone, including schoolteachers. Making a shift from traditional to online teaching was a challenge to the educators as the suddenness with which they were plunged into this new mode of teaching meant that they went into it with little preparation. So, initiatives to equip teachers to digitally be competent to excel in classrooms is the need of the hour”, said Babu. “Training programmes will be carried out in the evenings without affecting the normal work routine of schoolteachers. All the sessions are designed in a highly interactive and gamified manner so that teachers will get a feel of how to integrate gamification into online teaching. Apart from online training, teachers will be provided with individual hands-on training on gamifying their classroom with the help of assignments and live simulations. Certificates will be provided to all teachers who successfully complete the training programme by attending all the sessions and submitting all the assignments.  Based on the participation and involvement, 10 teachers will be given the best participant award during the valedictory function,” said Joy. NSS-VHSE programme coordinator Ranjith P said that for each batch, 90 teachers from the list of more than 7,000 VHSE teachers in the state will be included based on self-nomination.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/gamification-for-efficacy-in-online-edu/articleshow/86351759.cms||---

Now, the tourism sector in Kochi and outskirts is starting new projects and exploring fresh locations besides reopening the existing ones. According to the officials with the district tourism promotion council (DTPC), number of tourists visiting various destinations has increased. “It is during weekends that more people turn up. Tourists, especially domestic travellers, visit various destinations like beaches,” an official with the DTPC said. “After a couple of months, we expect more flow of tourists from north Indian states,” the official said. The water sports facility at Munambam was reopened on Wednesday. “There is very good response from the tourists. Activities at Munambam include skiing, surfing, banana ride, catamaran ride, kayaking, etc. It is the only beach in the area with such activities. The beach is very spacious with facility for parking,” said another DTPC official. The DTPC in association with a private partner is all set to start a kayaking facility and eco-friendly cottages at Aluva Manappuram. “We were planning to launch the project by the end of September. But the irrigation department has to carry out some restoration works near Harithavanam park at Manappuram,” said Santos King Tours and Travels director Santhosh Thayyil. It is in tie-up with Santos King Tours and Travels that the DTPC is planning the project. “We will be using non-motorized boats at Aluva. There will be kayaking and stand up paddle facilities through Periyar. We have a plan to connect various less known destinations like Parunthuranji Manappuram in the vicinity and make it a tourism circuit,” Thayyil said. “Tribespeople from Idukki will be making bamboo rafts for the purpose,” he said. Moreover, the tourism department is planning to conduct maximum promotional programmes as part of World Tourism Day on September 27.

Police said the accused had duped the aspirants for around Rs 2.5 crore and even organised fake training programmes in Dehradun as a part of the con. According to the police, the accused has been identified as Mohammad Raghib Firoz of Greater Noida. Firoz holds a postgraduate degree in psychology and a diploma in journalism and mass communication. “The accused coordinated all the activities of the racket, including the collection of money from victims, filling different forms regarding appointments and training, besides other miscellaneous parts of the con,” said R K Singh, additional commissioner of police (Economic Offences Wing). Singh said that two people, Brij Kishore and Sachin Kumar, were arrested in the case earlier. The arrested men told police that 40 job aspirants were cheated to the tune of Rs 2.44 crore by them. Most of the victims come from low-income families in villages around Agra, Hathras and Patna. Investigations revealed that one accused would pose as an IAS officer and lie to the victims about having good acquaintance and liaison with the Railway board, while others organised bogus job training sessions for the targets. Fake appointment and training letters were issued, fake medical examinations were conducted, and three months’ job training was also organised in Dehradun to earn their trust. The probe revealed that the victims had no idea about the accused’s whereabouts, except for their phone numbers. “The accused used to meet the targets at hotels in Paharganj and near the Railway Bhawan in Delhi. Through manual and technical surveillance, our team traced the third accused from Greater Noida.

---||Delhi||Water under the bridge: A plan to clear the mess at underpass in south Delhi||NEW DELHI: The waterlogging problem at Pul Prahladpur underpass in south Delhi is likely to be resolved within the next four months as the Public Works Department has awarded work for devising a permanent solution to the flooding that plagues the area every monsoon. The improvement work will cost Rs 2.6 crore and is likely to start next month. Pul Prahladpur underpass is on Mehrauli-Badarpur Road, which is an arterial stretch for people travelling to Faridabad, Badarpur, Sarita Vihar and beyond from Saket, Deoli and nearby places. Even after a short spell of heavy rainfall, this underpass gets flooded, which makes it impossible for vehicular traffic to use the road. The stretch is barricaded for the safety of commuters and people are forced to take a long detour, which leads to traffic congestion. The blockade continues for a couple of days till rain stops and the underpass dries up. The problem has also become a political issue. Leader of the Opposition in Delhi assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri recently claimed that he had to ride a boat to go to his Badarpur constituency. He said the underpass got flooded with rainwater as drains were clogged. Blaming the AAP government for the waterlogging, he added that thousands of people taking the road to travel to Badarpur and Gurgaon faced a lot of trouble. Bidhuri had released a video of him riding the boat on social media. The Badarpur MLA had said he had brought the condition of the underpass to the notice of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal long ago. A tender was floated by PWD on July 16 for addressing the problem. An official said the firm that got the work order would have to improve the area surrounding the underpass and construct a new sump within four months. A large underground pit would be created to suck the rainwater collected in the underpass so that it does not get flooded. A large heavy-duty motor would be installed at the site to pump out water to ensure there was no flooding. While two pumping sets are already installed at the site, they turn out to be inadequate to pump out the huge amount of collected water during heavy rainfall. Two sewage manholes would also be shifted as part of the improvement of the underpass because even they start overflowing after heavy rainfall.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/water-under-the-bridge-a-plan-to-clear-the-mess/articleshow/86354672.cms||---

Addressing the farmers of Karimnagar rural mandal, the minister said the farmers would face severe hardships if they don’t take the state government’s advice to switch to other crops. “You can cultivate sunflower, groundnut, millets and cotton among others,” he said. With Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao personally taking up the matter with the central minister, Food Corporation of India (FCI) has agreed to procure the paddy of last Yasangi and the next Vanakalam season. However, FCI made it clear that it would not purchase boiled rice of the next Yasangi season, the minister said. Expressing concern over the Centre’s decision, some farmers told the minister that it was suitable for them to take up cultivation of coarse variety of paddy. They urged him to take their opinion to the notice of CM KCR. The minister said he would organise a meeting of agriculture officials and scientists with the farmers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cut-paddy-area-grow-other-crops/articleshow/86353815.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The exam started at 9am in 10 centres. Students took four tests of 70 minutes each. At DAV College, Sector 10, parents and students were a harried lot. The center had a maths paper at 9am which was to end at 10.10am and the next paper of chemistry was to start at 10.40am. Students were instructed to arrive at the center one hour before the start of the examination. Those taking the chemistry test left the college at 9.40am but students who finished the examination at 10.10am came out after 10.20am, due to which students who came for the next examination stood outside the college from 9.40am to 10.20am. They were not allowed to enter at the given time which did not went well for the parents.The parents started questioning the college authorities. The wait caused traffic jams outside the college. Talking to TOI outside DAV College, father of one of the students, Vikram Singh said that there was such a crowd outside the center that it did not look like the administration had made arrangements to follow Covid protocol. He added that the health department should take action against the university and the college for letting such a huge crowd gather. Protocol followed Principal, DAV College, Pawan Sharma said Panjab University, which conducted the examination, should have made arrangements. “Crowds were reported to have gathered outside the college but no students were allowed inside as we had to follow our protocol. In every entrance examination, students are asked to report in advance. The college had to screen every student, so it took time to check. We all are aware of the parking problem outside the college which I believe has added to the pertaining situation,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/parents-cry-foul-over-crowding-outside-cet-centre/articleshow/86351819.cms||---

KSEB resolved to utilise the service of a retired executive engineer for the smooth implementation of the work meant for improving the agility and efficiency of hydro-electric dams and enhancing the monitoring mechanism of the dams. In 2012, the Union government introduced the dam rehabilitation and improvement programme (DRIP) with World Bank assistance. In 2014, the board decided to implement the project with an estimated cost of $25.41 million. However, when a tender for establishing instrumentation at 36 dams was invited in 2019, the board received very poor response. It received only two bids and the technical offers from the bidders were found non-responsive during the technical evaluation. Following this, the tender was cancelled, with the concurrence of the central project monitoring unit of the Central Water Commission (CWC) to retender the work with revised norms. The board decided to use the service of retired executive engineer Aloushy Paul C, who was associated with the supply, installation, testing, commissioning and maintenance of real-time structural health monitoring and early warning system at Idukki dam. The board decided to use Aloushy’s service as a technical expert for the evaluation of the bid and for providing technical advice during the implementation of the instrumentation and surveillance system in dams.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/retd-official-to-help-kseb-prepare-bid-documents/articleshow/86351930.cms||B S Anilkumar

While speaking at a webinar for Sunday schoolteachers Fr Roy Kannanchira who heads the Deepika Children’s League, said nine girls belonging to a Syro Malabar parish near Kottayam have eloped with Ezhava youngsters in one month. “We are talking more about “love jihad” and “narcotic jihad”. Along with it, our children are getting attracted to other sections as well,” he said, adding that he has information that it is a strategically planned move and that the young men are even getting training for it. “We are not cautious, that is one of the biggest crises that we face,” the priest said. After the video of the speech went viral, the priest expressed regrets in another video shared via YouTube and apologised for the remark if it has hurt anybody.

---||Ahmedabad||Strengthening the ‘Third Eye’ of police||AHMEDABAD: From hit-and-run incidents to thefts and abduction to murder, the importance of CCTV footage as an evidence and analysis of the incident has increased by every passing year. But can one compare the footage of one city with another? Or can the cameras not only perform the surveillance duty but also help preventing crime? With that aim in mind, the experts at National Forensic Sciences University (NFSU) have started the Bureau of Police Research & Development (BPR&D) funded project to study the CCTV networks in major cities of India and understand the human and technical aspects of camera surveillance. The outcome of the project will form backbone of a national level policy for CCTVs, said experts. Dr J M Vyas, vice-chancellor of NFSU, said that the project encompasses seven major cities such as Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai. “Surat from Gujarat is part of the study which encompasses close collaboration with city police, understanding specifications of camera and also public perspective,” he said. Primary issues addressed by the experts include the nature of CCTV network that can be most effective in covering the maximum area possible, finding the optimal mix of government and private cameras, quality of the footage, placement of cameras, and storage systems. “Some serious crimes need a continuous monitoring of the path the vehicle may have taken for example, or identification of persons when it’s taken place in dimly-lit places. As forensic science experts working with video analysis, we face these issues often,” said Dr Surbhi Mathur, senior assistant professor at NFSU. “Thus, when we started the project, the focus was on making the surveillance more effective and also devise ways in which the footage can help police find suspicious patterns.” “We have completed data collection from several cities, whereas work is on in some. We are hopeful of completing the project by December,” she added. What are some of the good practices the team has come across? Dr Mathur said that some police forces now recruit specialized personnel specifically for camera surveillance either through CCTV or drones. “They are better at remembering faces and technical aspects of the craft. Likewise, another force has sought help from citizens where the societies were requested to put at least one camera facing the road. Feed of that camera is accessible to police,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/strengthening-the-third-eye-of-police/articleshow/86351962.cms||Parth Shastri

With a show of numbers, environmental organisations like local units of global environment NGO Fridays For Future (an international movement of school students started by Greta Thunberg), The Earth and Climate Initiative, Do Not Trash, Citizens for Green Doon, The Friends of The Doon Society, Rajpur Community Initiative, IDEAL, Titli Trust, Pramukh, MAD by BTD and Aagas hope to convince the government to drop the plan. TOI had reported that the Centre has approved the project and sanctioned Rs 77 crore for it, allowing over 2,000 eucalyptus, mango, peepal and other trees to be chopped. “These trees have braved the storms and floods of Doon valley. The officials are wrong in calling them mature trees ready for felling. They are in very good condition. We have inspected the site,” said Dr Aanchal Sharma, founder of The Earth and Climate Initiative. “These trees are home to several birds and if the trees are gone, the birds will too.” Besides, it would cause immense ecological damage, Sharma explained. “Dehradun is a valley. If trees are uprooted, we will get submerged in floods,” she said. “The ecology of a valley should be left untouched.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/with-4k-tweets-11k-signatures-delhi-mussoorie-road-widening-stir-goes-online/articleshow/86349576.cms||Shivani Azad

The revenue department, and the department for information and technology appear keen on bringing in a paradigm shift by trying to introduce a mechanism where citizens will no longer need to submit documents either physically or digitally to avail services and schemes. While still in a nascent stage, the government has succeeded in integrating the income tax department’s online PAN portal and the directorate of settlement and land records with Goa Online. Goa Electronics Ltd (GEL) is now working with other departments to not only provide online service, but to also make document submission unnecessary. The other departments are the registration department, planning and statistics, chief electoral office, registrar of companies, Goa State pollution control board, directorate of panchayats, municipal administration and department of transport. “It is time to have a digital process wherein documents get attached to the application directly from the source department in real time without any intervention by the applicant,” revenue secretary Sanjay Kumar said. Right now, anyone applying for the Deen Dayal Swasthya Seva Yojana needs to submit several documents, including marriage certificate, ration card, Aadhaar card and other documents. Similarly for the Startups and IT firms, applications for various incentives require labour and employment documents, residence certificates. Citizens need to stand in line and apply for the documents and then submit them to the relevant departments. Kumar said that the government proposes to make all these certificates available for the citizen online 24x7, which in turn will simplify the online application process for at least 157 services that are currently available on Goaonline. Goa’s IT department has identified the departments that issue documents that are used for availing services or schemes of other departments. The department organised a training session for officials of the various government departments and then issued directions requesting the selected departments to integrate various documents issued by them on the Goaonline portal. In implementation of this concept, an Application Programming Interface (API) integration kit is being used to connect each government department to Goaonline so that documents can be automatically attached from the government’s database.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/soon-no-need-to-file-docus-proofs-to-avail-govt-services/articleshow/86353934.cms||Newton Sequeira

A section of bank employees said that over a dozen officials, who gave statements about the irregularities in the bank during the ongoing probe, are among those transferred. They alleged that the transfers were part of the vindictive steps undertaken by the bank’s administration. They said that even internal auditors, who are to be based at the bank headquarters, were transferred to some branches. Meanwhile, bank authorities said the transfers were made as per the general order made by the state cooperative department. The circular issued by cooperative registrar PB Nooh on September 9 has mandated that no employee should be allowed to remain in a section, including branches, for more than two years. Also, the administrative committees of banks should take steps to ensure the safety of banking software and internal auditors should conduct inspections in branches and submit reports to branches. Income tax officials had conducted raids at AR Nagar Service Cooperative Bank and had allegedly unearthed illegal transactions and multiple discrepancies, including operation of illegitimate bank accounts. Also, a probe by the cooperatives department is underway about the allegations which have surfaced about the bank.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/mass-transfer-of-employees-at-ar-nagar-co-op-bank/articleshow/86351999.cms||---

This has been the situation since several years, resulting in students being deprived of a quality education. This has forced Prakash Anchan, who heads ‘Sarkari Shaale Ulisi Belesi’ (Protect and Promote Government School) to write a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, requesting to fill all vacancies. The posts have remained vacant for several years, for unknown reasons. “As per the data available, as many as 412 and 196 teaching posts are vacant in primary and high schools in the district, respectively. Besides, roughly about 200 teachers are on the verge of retirement.” In his letter to the Prime Minister, Anchan highlighted that the numbers of students in government schools are increasing due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Several efforts have been made to empower government schools across the state. As a case in point, he cited the government school in Daddalakadu in Bantwal, which was on the verge of closure, with only 30 students, which was adopted by a local youth club, and the school turned into a model one. In less than five years, the strength of students has increased to more than a thousand. Though the student strength has increased, there are not enough government teachers. The government of Karnataka has not filled the vacant posts. “If the condition continues in the coming days, government schools will struggle to survive. Students will be at the receiving end,” he said in his letter. Anchan further told TOI, that this is the apt time to improvise the government school system, as many students are migrating from private schools to government ones. “The teacher transfer process in the district will be completed in a month. We will make sure that no school in the district has a shortage of teachers. Guest faculty will be deputed in all the schools with less teachers,” said Malleswamy, DDPI, Dakshina Kannada.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/several-full-time-teaching-posts-vacant-in-govt-schools/articleshow/86349571.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

Women have played an active role and have been the backbone, and more men should join them, he said. Talking to TOI, president of Bharatiya Sikh Sangthan Jasbir Singh Virk also reminded the farmers' sacrifice in adverse weather conditions and the loss of lives during the massive protest. Don't let their sacrifice go to waste, Virk said. The UP-based community leader urged more men to join the movement. "Several women from farmers’ families, belonging to different states, have come out in support and have been actively involved in the movement. Their presence at the protest sites shows our unity, like a family, and the authorities should know that we are very serious.” “We gave our complete support to the recent 'Kisan Mahapanchayat' in Muzaffarnagar," Virk said, and now want the 'Bharat Bandh' on September 27 to be successful, too. People should, however, protest in a peaceful way during the 'bandh' and keep their premises shut, he said. "Farmers, in particular, have been told to stay away from any kind of provocation and violence.” The 65-year-old leader further said, “I have been travelling to various states and conducting regular meetings with our community members. When I visited Mumbai, the main gurdwara committee in Dadar, which heads 164 gurdwaras, was reluctant to hold a meeting. But, when I explained the 'black' laws and its negative effects in detail, they gave us full support."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/ahead-of-bharat-bandh-sikh-community-leader-wants-more-men-at-delhis-borders/articleshow/86349602.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

Police said the armed men suddenly entered the house of Dr Jaswant Rai, 57, who runs his own ultrasound centre in Shahid Nagar, at around 8:30pm. The doctor was having dinner while his wife, Sunita, a gynaecologist, and his brother’s wife, Seema, who works as a tax officer in Firozabad, were sitting and chatting when the intruders pounced on them. The doctor couple stay alone while their daughter is studying medicine in Lucknow. Their sister-in-law was visiting them. Before he could react, one of the men hit him on his head. Rai said he lost consciousness. When he came to his senses, he found himself and his family members securely bound with tapes in one of the rooms. “The men threatened to kill us if we raised an alarm,” said Rai, adding that they took the keys of the almirahs from the family. After taking out all the cash and jewellery worth Rs 20 lakh, they put it all in a bag and fled. The trio managed to free themselves and called for help. Police said there were no signs of forced entry. Initially 44 people from the area were detained in a bid to identify the suspects by making the victims hear their voices. They were, however, released later as the family could not identify the looters on the basis of their voice. Vikas Kumar, SP (City), said, 10 teams had been formed to work out the case and it would soon be solved. An FIR has been registered against the five unidentified looters under IPC sections 395(Same offence with concealment of the former marriage from the person with whom subsequent marriage is contracted.), 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt.) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/5-armed-men-hold-agra-doctors-family-hostage-loot-house/articleshow/86349624.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Goa||Four Goa-run colleges headless as govt sits on GPSC names||PANAJI: Four major professional colleges in the state are currently functioning without a regular principal or head of institution even as highly-qualified and experienced candidates have been recommended for these posts by the Goa Public Service Commission. The Goa College of Engineering, Goa College of Architecture, Goa College of Art, and Goa Medical College are all currently headless. Most of these institutes are under the control of the director of technical education, and questions are now being asked in academic circles as to why the government is delaying the appointments of these institutional heads. The engineering college, in Farmagudi, was without a full-time principal for more than 15 years till the commission recommended Dr K Mysuru, who joined in 2018 but has since proceeded on long leave, leaving the college without a principal. The Goa College of Architecture has been without a principal for more than a decade now, and recently, the GPSC recommended Dr Leon Morenas to the position, Similarly, the commission recommended Dr Prajakta Parvatkar to the position of principal, Goa College of Art, which has been lying vacant since 2019. The government turned down both these recommendations without citing any reasons. Recently, the commission had recommended that Dr J P Tiwari be appointed dean, GMC. This proposal too has been lying with the government for more than a month. An educationist said that the government’s indecision on the issue of appointment of principals shows the scant regard it has for improving the quality of education in the state. He added that the fact that no state-run professional college finds mention in the recently-released list of top colleges in the country points to poor leadership at the policy and institutional level. In 2017, the government approved the appointment of five principals to government colleges, and significant improvements have been seen at these institutions; in fact, government college, Khandola, features in the top colleges list. In times of online learning with the hybrid format of educational content delivery being the norm in the future, students of these top institutions will be the ultimate losers in the absence of full-time heads of institutions, educationists feel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/4-state-run-colleges-headless-as-govt-sits-on-gpsc-names/articleshow/86353960.cms||Murari Shetye

The girl allegedly committed suicide on Sept 7 and police had initially registered a case of unnatural death. However, it was found that the teacher had sent inappropriate messages to the student over social media and it had caused mental strain to the girl, thus forcing her to take the extreme step. The issue came to light after the father examined the phone of the girl and the matter was reported to the school principal.

---||Coimbatore||BU VC concerned over undue delay in clearing PhD works||Coimbatore: Bharathiar University (BU) vice-chancellor has raised concerns about undue delay in awarding PhDs to scholars in the varsity. Much of the delay was attributed to research supervisors and the varsity is working out ways and means to eliminate the delay. Vice-chancellor P Kaliraj said that they have identified 75 PhD candidates whose viva voce has been dragging on for months together without any valid reason.Usually, it takes three years for a full time PhD candidate to complete the research work without extension. Once the thesis is submitted by a PhD student, it is sent for evaluation by an external examiner. Once the evaluation report is received from the examiner, the research supervisor must send a consolidated report to the university to facilitate viva voce for the student. While the viva-voce should be conducted within six months after external examiners give their evaluation report, there is a delay of more than one year in several cases.“There is no reason for research guides to delay the viva voce when external examiners have given a report after evaluating the PhD thesis,” Kaliraj felt.One of the measures planned by the university to eliminate the delay was to appoint a research coordinator from the university in the related discipline. The research coordinator shall initiate the process of viva voce even if research supervisors delay the process. This would facilitate the conduct of viva voce on time and awarding doctorate to the scholars without delay.Kaliraj had explained his objective of eliminating the delay during a recent interaction with principals of colleges affiliated to the varsity where several PhD scholars are pursuing doctorates. “We may not want to replace the research supervisors, but a research coordinator would step in when there is a delay in conducting the viva voce,’’ he said.A few research scholars who had faced such delay told TOI that the research supervisors often delay the PhD completion process. “Supervisors want to retain the PhD scholars as long as possible so that they can extract academic work done from them,’’ a research scholar said. One of the PhD candidates from Coimbatore said that she hesitated to do the entire academic work of her research supervisor as it was giving less time for her to focus on her research. “My guide ensured that my PhD work dragged on for over 6 years till I get special extension to complete my PhD work,” she said. She said she could not take up the matter with the university fearing backlash from my guide as could have put her PhD work at risk. Difference of opinion being another major factor that prevents the guide from approving PhD work of their students, according to scholars.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/bu-vc-concerned-over-undue-delay-in-clearing-phd-works/articleshow/86353988.cms||Sampath Kumar
---||Madurai||Allow students to attend physical classes only if parents are fully vaccinated: Doctors||COIMBATORE: More challenges await schools with the state government gearing up to reopen them for lower classes. Schools had resumed physical classes for the students of Classes IX to XII on September 1. A decision on reopening the schools for the students of Classes I to VIII is expected by this month-end, if there is no significant increase in daily Covid caseload. Medical practitioners have suggested a few precautionary measures ahead of reopening schools for the age group of 5-15 years. They said only those students whose parents were fully vaccinated should be allowed on school campuses with strict Covid preventive measures in place. D Vijayagiri, paediatric and laparoscopic surgeon, SGK Hospital, said, “We have seen 10 Covid clusters at Mettupalayam and surrounding areas recently. Children were among the infected and the cases were not severe among the kids whose parents were fully vaccinated. So, only those children whose parents and grandparents are fully vaccinated should be allowed to attend physical classes.” A Jayavardhana, professor and head department of paediatrics, PSG hospitals, said the students could be virus carriers and infect their classmates or family members. “But we can break the chain if family members are fully vaccinated.” As per the data available with the public health department, only less than 25% of the eligible population was fully vaccinated in the district four days ago. Teachers said it would be very challenging to ensure students’ adherence to face mask etiquette and social distancing all the time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/allow-students-to-attend-physical-classes-only-if-parents-are-fully-vaccinated-docs/articleshow/86353991.cms||Sampath Kumar

In the past two weeks, over 50 cases of dengue have been reported in Agra district. Fatehpur Sikri, Bah and Pinahat block are the worst affected. More than 1,500 cases of dengue have been confirmed in Agra division so far, according to the health department officials. Chief medical officer of Agra district, Arun Kumar Srivastava, said, “The peculiar thing about this fever is that we are getting less time to treat patients. They are dying quickly. Alert health department teams are conducting door-to-door surveys in the rural areas to identify patients with high fever. Medical camps have been set up." On Sunday, Ravi Pandey, a former gram pradhan and resident of Chachiha under Pinahat block, lost his 14-year-old son. “Chotu had a fever for two days. We consulted a private doctor in Fatehabad. His condition deteriorated in the morning. He was unable to speak. We were referred to the SN Medical College (SNMC) by a local community health centre," Pandey said, adding, "I saw my child dying on the way.” Three kids succumbed to high fever on Saturday. Two of them were siblings. Residents of Rasoolpur under the Fatehpur Sikri block of Agra district, Ruby (7) and Sachin (2) died at a private hospital in Bharatpur district. Suresh Chand, their father, alleged that staff at a local government health centre had denied admission. On Thursday, Vipin Kumar, Tedi Bagiya resident, lost his daughter Pari (3) and son Anshu (2). Pari died at a private hospital while Anshu passed away at the SNMC's emergency ward. Both had high fever and low platelet count. “Every household in the village has a family member with high fever and dengue symptoms. The community health centre is not admitting patients. The district hospital and SNMC is 50 km away. What should we do?” Vipin Singh, a resident of Midkoli under Bah block, said. Meanwhile, three more deaths were reported from Firozabad district - the hub of dengue cases - in 24 hours. Besides, two died in Etah, and one each in Kasganj and Mainpuri. In the last week, reports of deaths due to viral fever and dengue-like symptoms have surfaced from Aligarh, Mathura, Hathras, Meerut, Bareilly and some districts of eastern Uttar Pradesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/8-children-die-in-agra-in-last-4-days-dengue-cases-on-rise/articleshow/86349653.cms||Deepak Lavania

Also, the delay in the monsoon withdrawal over the Indian subcontinent for most of the 36 meteorological subdivisions is highly beneficial as it will increase the rain period or the length of the monsoon season over these areas, including Goa, Kumar said. Earlier, the withdrawal date of the monsoon from northwest India was September 1, but according to a new estimate, the India meteorological department (IMD) has revised it to September 17. Further, the date on which the monsoon withdraws from the subcontinent has been October 15. The normal date for monsoon onset over India is June 1 and for monsoon withdrawal is October 15 In the past decade, there have been at least three years where the delay was more than 10 days — in 2016, 2017 and 2020. The monsoon starts withdrawing from the northwest region of India when the following criteria are met — rainfall activity ceases over the area for five continuous days, an anticyclone establishes in the lower troposphere around 1.5km above sea level, and moisture content reduces.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/monsoon-withdrawal-likely-to-be-delayed-this-year/articleshow/86353992.cms||Nida Sayed

However, an inbuilt alarm went off when the burglar cut the wire in the machine, forcing him to flee. Nearby residents said they had heard the alarm sound around 5.30am and rushed to the Canara Bank building with its ATM centre on Vellalore-Singanallur road. When they found red chilli powder on its premises and black colour spray on CCTV cameras, they alerted the Podanur police. A team led by police inspector A Natesan visited the crime scene immediately, while forensic experts lifted a few fingerprints from the ATM centre. Bank authorities, who checked the CCTV footage, said the burglar had covered his face with clothes.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/man-attempts-to-rob-atm-at-vellalore/articleshow/86353982.cms||---

The new lab will have all the facilities to conduct RT-PCR and other tests, including malaria and dengue testss. The district administration has prepared an estimate of Rs 1 crore to set up the new lab, through the state disaster response fund (SDRF) in Puttur. Swabs for RT-PCR tests from taluk hospitals, community health centres and PHCs of Sullia, Puttur, Kadaba and Belthangady taluks will be sent to the new lab in Puttur, once it is opened. Similarly, the new lab will also function as the second district laboratory with all infrastructure. At present, swabs for RT-PCR tests from the region are being transported to KVG Medical College in Sullia, and Wenlock District Hospital in Mangaluru. District health and family welfare officer Dr Kishore Kumar M told TOI that a preliminary survey of the Puttur taluk hospital buildings and surrounding areas have been conducted to set up the new lab. “A project report with an estimate for the new lab in Puttur has already been prepared. Since the Puttur taluk hospital lacks sufficient space, we have plans to open the lab in one of the available buildings in its compound. We have plans to shift the RT-PCR unit from Sullia to Puttur. In addition, a request will also be sent to the government to sanction a new RT-PCR machine for the new lab in Puttur,” he said, adding that the new lab is expected to be opened within a month after the commencement of work. “Though the number of tests being conducted in the district is reducing, we will be prepared with all infrastructure. The test positivity rate in Dakshina Kannada did not cross 2% after September 7. The number of daily cases in the district were also less than 200 in the past 10 days,’’ he said, adding the district has been conducting an average of 10,000 RT-PCR tests per day. The district has eight laboratories conducting RT-PCR tests, including two government facilities at Wenlock District Hospital and KVG Medical College in Sullia, as well as six private labs. Nearly 80% of the RT-PCR tests are conducted in the government labs at Wenlock District Hospital and in Puttur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/new-rt-pcr-lab-to-come-up-soon-in-puttur/articleshow/86349647.cms||---
---||Delhi||Gangster, aides with pan-India plans charged under MCOCA||NEW DELHI: Delhi Police’s Special Cell has filed a chargesheet under the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) against notorious gangster Lawrence Bishnoi, his Man Friday, Sampat Nehra, and nine others for running an inter-state crime syndicate. Nehra had earlier hit the spotlight after being arrested in an alleged plot to kill actor Salman Khan on instructions of Bishnoi. The other members of the syndicate charged by the police are Jagdeep Singh alias Jaggu Bhagwanpuria, Rajkumar alias Raju Basodi, Ravinder alias Kali-Shooter, Naresh Sethi, Priyavrat, Anil Leela, Rahul Sanga, Sachin Bhanja and Akshay Antil. They are currently behind bars with a majority of them lodged in Tihar jail. The special cell had earlier filed a separate FIR under sections 3 and 4 of MCOCA to put a leash on the illegal activities of this gang which, at present, is spread across at least six states and comprises over 600 criminals. The chargesheet filed by the police elaborates on how Bishnoi and his syndicate amassed crores of rupees through organised crime and forging alliances with gangsters of north Indian states. The chargesheet accuses the syndicate of indulging in large-scale extortion, land-grab and contract killings while being lodged in jail. Bishnoi (30), son of a former policeman, belongs to Fazilka in Punjab. After completing his basic schooling from the local school in his hometown, he enrolled at DAV College in Chandigarh, says a senior police officer. In college, Bishnoi got involved in campus politics and also became a popular leader of Students' Organisation of Punjab University, a dossier on him states. This paved the way for him to transform into a “don” and quit studies. He failed exams and even appeared for one in handcuffs. Investigators recall Bishnoi as a youth who was interested in wrestling and practiced at the local Akhara regularly. His brother was into boxing. Bishnoi made his first gang in college and never looked back. As of today, he is named in over 25 heinous cases, ranging from offences like murder, extortion, carjacking, robberies and Arms Act. In 2016, Bishnoi was accused of killing a Congressman even as he claimed responsibility for it though Facebook. In 2018, he threatened to eliminate Salman Khan ahead of a court hearing in the Blackbuck poaching case. He also sent his aide, Sampat Nehra, to Mumbai to conduct reconnaissance of his house but Nehra was caught by the police. Of late, he has been under the radar of intelligence agencies for having links with Italian and Mexican mafia. Bishnoi had last year made an ambitious plan to forge alliance with local gangsters of each state and form a pan-India crime syndicate, which would control the underworld in north India. He recently joined hands with gangster Kala Jathedi as part of this plan. “The alliance aimed to indulge in extortion, drug and illegal arms trafficking, land grabbing and target killings, in collaboration with their partners in Mexico, Italy and Thailand. On their target are Bollywood celebrities, Punjabi singers and actors and businessmen from Rajasthan, Delhi and Haryana,” said a source. Bishnoi allegedly has links with international drug trafficker Amandeep Multani, connected with Mexican drug cartels. Multani was arrested by the US Drug Enforcement Agency in April this year. The second international contact has been identified as one Monty from the UK who has links with an Italian mafia outfit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/gangster-aides-with-pan-india-plans-charged-under-mcoca/articleshow/86354696.cms||Raj Shekhar
---||Coimbatore||Mass vaccination drive: Over 48% people get second dose||COIMBATORE: As many as 94,723 people were inoculated during the mass vaccination drive conducted across the district on Sunday. Almost half of them got their second dose. There was good demand for Covishield and vaccines were rushed to centres that ran out of stock by afternoon. With an aim of vaccinating a lakh population, vaccination camps were organised at 706 places across the district. Last week, 1,51,685 people were vaccinated in Coimbatore district, only next to Chennai where 1,85,370 were vaccinated as part of the mass vaccination drive. The district administration had planned vaccination camps at 1,475 centres last week and 33% of the population got their second dose. Over 48% of the population got the second dose on Sunday, which shows high demand for the second dose. Out of the 94,723 people inoculated on Sunday, 45,716 got their second dose. Unlike last week, when most of the people visited the camps during afternoon hours, people turned as early as 7am on Sunday. “Majority of the population who got their first dose of Covishield in June and July are due for their second dose and made use of the mass vaccination drive,” said a health official. R Kannan, 40, of Velandipalayam had to visit three vaccine camps along with his wife to get the vaccine. “I was informed by health staff that the vaccine got exhausted before afternoon when I visited the centres at 3pm. However, I managed to get vaccinated at the Mahalinga Nagar centre. It has been 90 days since I got the first dose of Covishield,” he told TOI. Meanwhile, the district administration has made it mandatory for shopkeepers and customers to carry vaccination certificates from Monday. But many people, who were vaccinated in the recent weeks, are yet to receive certificates. Deputy director of health services P Aruna instructed such people to visit the centres they were vaccinated to get the certificate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/mass-vaccination-drive-over-48-people-get-second-dose/articleshow/86354000.cms||---

Speaking to TOI, many of them said that the tourist activity had dropped in the hill state due to the fear of rain-related incidents. However, people are now booking for trekking to spots like Milam and Pindari glaciers as well as Nanda Devi and Panchachuli base camps. "We had stopped receiving bookings in June as rain-related incidents in Uttarakhand stoked fear in tourists. Thankfully, people are now calling in to enquire about the situation in the hills and making bookings for treks,” said Heera Singh, a trekking guide from Bageshwar district who organises treks to Pindari and Kafni glaciers. Locals say that even one-day treks in the region have started witnessing bookings after months. “Smaller treks like Khaliya Top are becoming popular and people are booking guides to these areas,” said Beena Devi, a homestay owner in Pithoragarh’s Munsiyari town. Meanwhile, many others involved in the tourism business say that even though the rain spells have stopped, many roads are still to be repaired and therefore, some of the tourists are still wary of traveling to far-off places.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/as-monsoon-subsides-trekking-and-mountaineering-activities-pick-up-in-uttarakhand/articleshow/86349703.cms||Prashant Jha

Shruthi, who was a law student in Bengaluru, had informed the parents that she would reach home on August 20. However, the parents said they received a phone call from Erode police station on April 17 saying that Shruthi has been admitted to a hospital there. When they reached there, they were told that Shruthi had died. The family suspects that Shruthi had become a victim of the actions of a drug and sex racket, Karthikeyan said. Kairali said as per the postmortem report, Shruthi had sustained fractures on the ribs. “I had requested the authorities in Erode to show me the full body of Shruthi before postmortem, but they showed me only her face, and the rest of the body was covered,” Kariali said. The family members said they were yet to receive the forensic analysis report of the samples collected from the Shruthi’s body. She also alleged that she had become suspicious after talking to Shruthi’s friends. “I was asked by the police to sign in some documents written in Tamil. Initially I declined, but later they persuaded me to sign in those papers, assuring me that they were related to the release of the body of my daughter. However, I came to know that the document had actually stated that I had no complaints about the death of Shruthi,” Kairali said. “From the conversations of her friends, I could make out that she had set off from Bengaluru to reach home as she had informed earlier, and had come up to Edamuttam near Valappad. But she was taken to Aluva, and from there to Erode by her friends. There are indications that Shruthi and her friends had a quarrel at Aluva station,” she alleged. The family of Shruthi had given a complaint at Valappad police station also. An officer had accompanied Karthikeyan and Kariali to Erode station. “But the case has to be investigated by the police at Erode as the crime had taken place there,” an officer at Valappad station said. However, Valappad police have taken the statement of Shruthi’s friend Harikrishnan from Adoor, who was present at Erode when the family reached there. “His statements have to be cross-checked. We have brought them to the notice of the Tamil Nadu police, through official channels,” said Valappad CI Sushant. “I have sent a complaint to several officials, including the chief minister, but none has told me what has happened to my daughter,” Kairali said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/a-month-on-these-parents-grope-in-the-dark-over-their-daughters-death/articleshow/86352141.cms||T Ramavarman
---||Chandigarh||Excessive oil in diet leading to early heart attacks: Report||Times News Network Chandigarh: A recent report published in the journal, The Lancet, says that younger Indians, especially those born after 1970, are dying of Ischaemic heart disease. Hydrogenated vegetable oil like Vanaspati is consumed in great quantities in states like Punjab, where more than 35.7% of the population has hypertension - a much higher figure than the national average of 25.3%. Various researches have been conducted to study trans-fat, an unhealthy fat. It has been concluded that trans-fat, an invariable component of industrial fat, is one of the major dietary factors associated with Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) mortality, increasing the risk of heart disease by 21% and deaths by 28%. “Trans-fats have been proven to be one of the major risk factors for cardiovascular diseases worldwide. The guidelines by WHO for assessment and management of cardiovascular risk state that the risk of developing a disease is higher in people on antihypertensive and diabetes therapy and those who are obese and physically inactive,” said Dr Sonu Goel, principal investigator, Strengthening Management of Hypertension Services Project (SMHSP) and professor, department of community medicine and school of public health, PGIMER. He added, “Similar is the case with people having a family history of premature CHD (Chronic Heart Disease) or stroke and raised triglyceride level. Modifiable risk factors include unhealthy diets - excessive salt consumption, a diet high in saturated fat and trans fats and low intake of fruits and vegetables.” Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are the leading cause of disease burden and deaths globally. In recent years, the rising burden of cardiovascular diseases and high disease severity has been one of the significant threats in low-income and middle-income countries compared with high-income countries. Every year, it accounts for 17.7 million deaths, which amounts to 31% of all global deaths. Four out of five cardiovascular diseases (CVD) deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes and more than 75% of these deaths are concentrated in low and middle-income countries. Cardiovascular diseases (heart diseases), considered a common problem among the elderly, are steadily rising among those below 50 years of age. Over the last three decades, there has been an increase in the rate of coronary artery diseases (CAD) in India. A study published by the Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research in 2016 states that Indians have three, six and 20 times greater risk of hypertension than the American, Chinese and Japanese population, respectively. “People who are young and are under the impression that heart attacks happen only in old age should wake up and adopt a healthy lifestyle at the earliest. One should give at least one hour to oneself and make sure not to ignore body signals,” advised Dr Sonu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/excessive-oil-in-diet-leading-to-early-heart-attacks-report/articleshow/86352068.cms||---

One of them is located at Nanjagoundanpalayam village, where farmers bring paddy for sales.The farmers said the paddy, which was stored in sacks, was soaked in the recent rain. “The direct procurement centre is functioning on a rice mill premises and there is no shelter to protect the paddy from rain,” said S Rajagopal, one of the farmers. Talking to TOI, he said the space was very limited on the mill premises, forcing them to store the paddy in an adjacent coconut farm.According to the farmers, the direct procurement centre at Nanjagoundanpalayam was functioning for more than five years. “We don’t have any other option, but to keep the paddy in the coconut farm,” said K Aravinth, another farmer.The farmers said the government officials hadn’t taken any steps to relocate the direct procurement centre or the godown to a safer place even after the paddy was soaked in the recent rain.“No one would buy the paddy if soaked in the rainwater. We are staring at a huge financial loss because of the official apathy,” Aravinth said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/relocate-paddy-to-safer-place-farmers-tell-govt/articleshow/86354013.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Curti-Khandepar villagers revive five water bodies, inspire a govt scheme||By: Durgashri Sardeshpande OLD GOA: Over the past three years, the villagers of Curti-Khandepar panchayat united to bring back to life as many as five community ponds, choked to death with waste and silt. For the most part, if the work required was minor, locals didn’t even bother waiting for government funds to be sanctioned. Now, the villagers’ perseverance has inspired a government scheme, which will aid such efforts by locals across any village in the state.  The work in the Ponda village was initiated at first by the Curti-Khandepar biodiversity management committee (BMC). The five ponds which have been revived were earlier used for irrigation by the community, but gradually neglect had pushed them to the verge of choking to non-existence. “Currently, locals have cleaned community ponds in Keri, Panchme, Kelbai, Copperwada and Curti area,” said Gurudas Khedekar, sarpanch of the panchayat. Having tasted success with the revival of the five water bodies so far, the locals have begun work on another four to five ponds. The locals work on the principle ‘minimum amount, maximum work’, which means that if minor work is required to bring the pond back to life, the villagers get started with the work without waiting for state funds. In case major work is required, the funds are allotted by the Goa state wetland authority. “In this one year, three projects have been completed under the ‘shram shakti se jal samruddhi’ (SSJS) initiative, and currently, 10-12 proposals are in line for approval, of which nods have been granted to three. Looking at the response and spirit of Goans, we have moved the file to prepare a scheme,” said environment minister Nilesh Cabral. In February last year, chief minister Pramod Sawant, pointing out that Goa is currently facing a shortage of 76 MLD of drinking water, launched the SSJS programme. The soon-to-be scheme aims at encouraging local communities to protect their own ecosystems. The programme was inspired from the model used by artist Harshada Kerkar and her niece Sharada Kerkar in Saligao to clean up filthy ponds with the help of locals and stranded migrants, with the aim to get buffaloes back to their resting place. “We liked the idea and decided to start a similar programme on a trial basis,” a senior official from Goa state biodiversity board told TOI. “The idea behind the programme is to preserve, revive and restore water bodies. The beauty of this programme is that less money is involved, and the impact is huge. Here, people are putting in their efforts. We provide the technical assistance and minimum amount for hiring the vehicles, and to buy the required machinery and refreshments.” The state allots a maximum of Rs 50,000 per pond to the community for the work. “Projects like these cannot succeed unless there is a sense of ownership through contributions at the ground level. Then the communities become stakeholders and will preserve the water bodies for which they had put in the hard work,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/curti-khandepar-villagers-revive-five-water-bodies-inspire-a-govt-scheme/articleshow/86354032.cms||---

The Ramlila committee headed by Agra mayor Naveen Jain, took the decision after consulting with the state authorities. This will be the fourth time in its 135-year-old history that the Ram Barat has been cancelled. The event was not organized last year due to Covid-19 outbreak, and also in 1947 and 1948, due to Partition of India and communal violence. Rajveer Agrawal, general secretary of the Ram Barat organizing committee said, “Considering the fact that lakhs of people participate in the Ram Barat event, the decision has been taken not to organize the event following the threat of the Covid-19. However, to continue with the tradition, all the programs of Ramlila will be organized in a symbolic manner at the Mankameshwar temple. Arrangements to telecast the events on social media are also being made.” Ram Barat is a unique, yearly festival in which the wedding ceremony of Ram and Sita is reconstructed, right from the barat procession to vidai. The barat passes from different parts of the city, and receives a grand welcome by locals, businessmen and market committee people. Artists and tableaux portraying various characters of the Ramayana are a major attraction. Following this, a grand reception ceremony takes place at the grand Janak Mahal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/agras-historic-ram-barat-cancelled-for-the-fourth-time-in-135-years/articleshow/86349721.cms||Deepak Lavania

Information provided by the central government says that no drone flying has been undertaken in any of the villages of Gujarat so far and hence, no property cards have been issued under the new scheme to any farmer of the state. In an unstarred question in the recent Lok Sabha session, Gujarat MP Mohanlal Kundariya sought to know the status of implementation of Survey of Villages and Mapping with Improvised Technology in Village Areas (SVAMITVA) scheme in Gujarat. Kundariya asked how may talukas had been selected under this scheme in Gujarat and the funds that have been allocated to the state under the SVAMITVA scheme. He also sought details by when mapping of village areas will be complete, especially in the districts of Rajkot and Sabarkantha.

---||Dehradun||Edu dept directs all govt teachers to return to their home schools||Dehradun: In an effort to better the student-teacher ratio across the state, the education department has asked all government teachers to join their respective home schools — where they were originally deputed. In Uttarakhand, the teachers who are deployed in remote or hilly areas often take postings in areas of their preference. This trend, according to the department, has led to a lack of teachers in several areas. The recent move is seen as an effort to better the quality of education in the state ahead of the upcoming assembly elections. Also, offline education has started in the schools after a long time and the department wants to build onto the momentum and bring normalcy among the students as well. Therefore, it has decided to dismiss the affiliation of the teachers to other schools as an adequate number of teachers are required in each school. Meanwhile, the state education department has appointed permanent principals in 73 state government-run schools. Among these, 58 principals have been appointed for various government inter colleges and the remaining for primary schools. According to TOI sources, more appointments of permanent principals are under process. Additionally, the department has been conducting drives to enroll more students in state-run schools. The student strength in several government schools has dropped following the Covid outbreak. In a recently-concluded drive, the department managed to enroll 1.2 lakh new students in government schools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/edu-dept-directs-all-govt-teachers-to-return-to-their-home-schools/articleshow/86349745.cms||Mohammad Anab
---||Ahmedabad||Internet subscribers up 10% in Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: Backed by high demand since the pandemic hit, the number of internet subscribers in Gujarat surged in 2020. According to data from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), internet subscribers in Gujarat stood at 4.8 crore as on December 31, 2020 against 4.4 crore a year earlier. According to telecom industry sources, with more people working from home, the number of internet users has increased. “Due to the lockdown, digital adoption grew significantly across all professional spheres and the internet became essential to keep the show going. As a consequence, more and more people opted for both broadband and mobile internet connections. The need only grew as people continued to work from home and education went online,” said a source. According to the TRAI data, the number of connections grew in both rural and urban areas. However, in the rural areas, the rate of increase was faster than in urban areas, albeit on a lower base. Rural internet subscribers grew by 13% in this period from 1.31 crore in 2019 to 1.47 crore in 2020, whereas urban internet subscriber numbers rose by 8.9% from 3.12 crore in 2019 to 3.41 crore in 2020. The number of people shifting to high-speed connections also increased in this the same period. According to the report by TRAI, the number of narrowband subscribers i.e. those opting for internet connections with slower speeds, fell. The number of people opting for broadband or high-speed connections went up. In 2020, the number of narrowband internet users fell by 17.5 lakh or 28.5%, against 24.5 lakh such subscribers in 2019. “With more members in every home working from home or taking online education, the requirement for bandwidth went up. Increasing use of video calling and video conferencing, the need for constant internet connectivity, greater online streaming of content, all led to a surge in bandwidth requirements. Thus more people shifted to high-speed connections,” said a source in the telecom sector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/internet-subscribers-up-10-in-gujarat/articleshow/86352134.cms||Niyati Parikh

The government had already acquired 3000 acre of land for Defence Corridor here, said member of parliament (MP) from Jhansi-Lalitpur Anurag Sharma. Addressing a press conference here on Sunday, on occasion of completion of four-and-a-half year of Yogi government in UP, Sharma talked about the development works done by the state government in the Bundelkhand region in its last four- and-a- half year rule. The survey for Metro rail has already started in Jhansi which had got delayed due to Covid pandemic, he further said. Talking about the progress of construction of the airport, he said that while the budget had been sanctioned for Lalitpur, but there are some minor technical glitches in Jhansi which will be sorted out soon and then the construction will be on full swing. “The Yogi government is the first government in UP which has transformed the Bundelkhand region and took several measures for the farmers. The mega ‘Har ghar nal yojana’ project was started from this region. Not only this, most of the canals have been desilted and the water has started reaching till the tail end of these canals. In addition, ponds have been dug up in 19,428 farms which besides helping in water conservation will promote fisheries and thus increase income of the farmers”, the Jhansi-Lalitpur MP said. The government, he said, is giving due importance to the cooperative societies in order to promote farm produce which help women to become self-reliant. In this context he cited the example of Balinee Milk Producer Company, a cooperative society, being run by women. This cooperative society has helped 36,000 women to become self reliant, he added. Speaking on the vaccination drive, Sharma said earlier the people in rural areas were reluctant to get vaccination but due to the sustained efforts of the government and the district administration, they are now coming forward on their own and getting themselves vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/jhansi-district-to-have-rifle-manufacturing-factory-defence-corridor-soon-mp/articleshow/86350856.cms||---

The letter also mentioned that action will be taken against anyone seen violating the orders. The diktat has been criticised by teachers by saying that it’s unfair for women teachers who at times have no one at home to look after their children. Talking to TOI, Rajendra Singh, district vice-president of Primary Teachers’ Association, said, “Many teachers belonging to other districts are posted here in Bijnor. They bring their children to schools as there is nobody to take care of them at their homes. Besides, some teachers have babies aged 1 to 2 years, who cannot be left alone. Thus, it is not a wrong practice and the order should be withdrawn.” Puja Singh, a teacher, said, “Even anganwadi centres allow staff to bring in their small children.

---||Mangaluru||With no takers, MSCL scales down transport hub project cost||Mangaluru: After three consecutive unsuccessful tender processes, the Mangaluru Smart City Limited (MSCL) has decided to scale down the project cost of the proposed integrated transport hub in the city. Though the Mangaluru City Corporation (MCC) has 7.23 acres reserved for a new integrated transport hub near Pumpwell flyover, the project is still in the proposal stage, due to a lack of bidders. With three tender invitations attracting no bidders, the MSCL is planning to implement the project with a new design and revised project cost. Accordingly, the project cost will be reduced from Rs 490 crore to Rs 150 crore. In fact, the MSCL has plans to develop the integrated transport hub, which includes a integrated bus terminal with retail mall and recreational centre, and a centralised and integrated bus terminal to include inter-city, intra-city and intra-state buses near the Pumpwell Junction. The project will have ancillary facilities for passengers, ample parking spaces, food stalls, hospitality, commercial space and other amenities. Mayor Premanand Shetty, who is also a director of the MSCL, told TOI that the new design with reduced project cost will be approved, and the process of re-tendering will begin soon. MSCL general manager Arun Prabha said that very soon a new detailed project report will be prepared, by scaling down the project. “We invited tenders for the project thrice, but did not find bidders to take it up. Hence, we have dropped all the previous plans regarding the project. We have held several consultations with various stakeholders, and decided to scale down the project. We have plans to reduce the project cost from Rs 490 crore to Rs 150 crore. We are in the process of preparing a new detailed project report for the project. Very soon, tenders will be invited for the new project,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/with-no-takers-mscl-scales-down-transport-hub-project-cost/articleshow/86349724.cms||---

---||Varanasi||Banaras Hindu University scientists discover new ‘metal eating’ bacteria||VARANASI: In a significant breakthrough, scientists at the Indian Institute of Technology, Banaras Hindu University (IIT-BHU), have discovered a bacteria that can separate toxic cancer-causing metal — hexavalent chromium — from water and make it safe for use. The research has been published in the reputed international journal, ‘Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering’. The new bacterial strain has been named ‘Microbacterium paraoxydans strain VSVM IIT (BHU)’. Dr. Vishal Mishra at the School of Biochemical Engineering, IIT (BHU), and his Ph.D student Veer Singh have isolated a new bacterial strain from a contaminated site which can remove toxic hexavalent chromium from wastewater. Hexavalent chromium is a heavy metal ion that is responsible for several types of health problems in humans, including various types of cancers, kidney and liver malfunctioning, infertility etc. Dr. Mishra said, “This new bacterial strain is able to tolerate large concentrations of hexavalent chromium. It is very effective for removal of hexavalent chromium from wastewater compared to other conventional methods. This bacterial strain showed fast growth rate in the Cr (VI) containing aqueous medium and easily separated the aqueous medium after the water treatment process.” “This bacterial strain is very advantageous because there is no need for an extra separation process after removal. Bacterial mediated wastewater treatment is inexpensive and non-toxic because there is no involvement of costly equipment and chemicals. The researchers have tested hexavalent chromium removal capacity of this bacterial strain in industrial and synthetic wastewater and found satisfactory results. Researchers also tested the hexavalent chromium removal mechanism in the bacteria. Research reported that several heavy metal tolerance mechanisms got activated in bacterial cells when they were grown in the growth medium containing hexavalent chromium,” he added. This research is focused on the cost-effective and eco-friendly method for removal of toxic metal ions such as hexavalent chromium from water. Bacteria can easily cultivate and remove hexavalent chromium in an effective way. No skilled labour is required for culturing bacterial strain. It is very inexpensive, non-toxic and easy to use. Also, separation after usage does not require large energy input and removes hexavalent chromium until the discharge limit of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). “Water-borne diseases are a major problem in developing countries. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) 3.4 million people, mostly children, die from water-related diseases each year. According to a United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef) assessment, 4,000 children die each day due to the intake of bacterial contaminated water. WHO reports that over 2.6 billion people lack access to clean water, which is responsible for about 2.2 million deaths annually, of which 1.4 million are children. Improving water quality can reduce the global water-borne diseases,” Dr. Mishra said. Cancer caused due to heavy metals such as hexavalent chromium is a severe problem worldwide. The developing countries such as India and China are very prone to heavy metal contamination. Human intake of hexavalent chromium is mainly through skin contact, intake of contaminated water or contamination in food products. The hexavalent chromium causes several diseases in the human body as well as dangerous ones like cancer. A report of the water resources ministry says a large number of the Indian population drink water with lethal levels of toxic heavy metals, about 239 million people across 153 districts in 21 states drink water that contains unacceptably high levels of toxic metal ions. WHO has warned that long-term intake of water containing toxic heavy metals such as lead, chromium, cadmium and arsenic may cause cancer of skin, gallbladder, kidney or lungs, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/iit-bhu-scientists-discover-new-metal-eating-bacteria/articleshow/86350893.cms||---

He said though mineral-rich Jharkhand gives a lot to the country, it hardly gets its due share in return. “Jharkhand is the land of struggle. Its minerals and resources help in developing the country. However, the amount which Jharkhand gives to the country, the central government does not give its equivalent share to Jharkhand (sic),” Tejashwi tweeted after reaching Ranchi. “Until and unless the old Bihar, that is Jharkhand, Bihar and Odisha progress, the country will not develop,” he further tweeted. Soon after reaching Ranchi, Tejashwi garlanded the statues of Birsa Munda and Jannayak Karpoori Thakur and paid tributes to both the legends. On Sunday, Tejashwi is scheduled to meet RJD workers at Ranchi. RJD’s Bihar spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan said Tejashwi would now regularly visit Jharkhand and hold meetings with party’s office-bearers and workers there. “Every third Saturday of each month, Tejashwiji will visit Jharkhand and review the party’s progress,” said Gagan, recalling the time when RJD had 10 MLAs in Jharkhand a decade back. “RJD under Tejashwiji’s leadership will strengthen its base in Jharkhand,” Gagan added. The RJD has just one MLA in Jharkhand, Satyanand Bokta, who represents Chatra constituency and is heading the labour ministry in the coalition government led by Hemant Soren.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/will-strengthen-rjd-in-jharkhand-tejas/articleshow/86327077.cms||Sheezan Nezami

---||Meerut||UP: Hindu woman forced to hit Muslim boyfriend with slippers on face||MEERUT: An interfaith couple was accosted, the Muslim man beaten up and the Hindu woman forced to hit him in the face with slippers in public as a video was shot to humiliate them. Members of the Hindu Jagran Manch, a right-wing outfit, then tried to get the Muslim man arrested for “forced conversion” but were later booked for rioting. It was on Friday at a busy market in Meerut that the couple was sitting under a tree. “A shopkeeper saw them and passed on the message,” said district president of Hindu Jagran Manch, Sachin Sirohi.  He landed there with 11 other men and confronted the couple. What were their names, they asked. The woman was Hindu and the man Muslim. They launched an attack on the man. After beating him up, they turned their attention to the woman. “Remove your slippers and hit him hard in the face,” one of them is heard saying in the 56-second video they shot which was shared widely. When she hit him lightly, the men ordered, “Is that all? Hit him with more force.” She slapped him with her slippers twice, after which the men said, “We are your brothers. We are standing here. Slap him with all you have.” One of them screams at the man, “How dare you smoke standing next to her?” while another says, “There are photos of women on his phone.” At this point, the video ends. The right-wing outfit members then made the man hold his ears through his legs and beat him up again. This went on for about 30 minutes, after which the men dragged the man to the police station — they wanted to get him booked for “forced conversion”. The woman, however, stood her ground. The man had not misbehaved with her, she told the police, and she was with him of her own accord. The Hindu Jagran Manch men then tried to get another person to complain, tracking down the mother of a female friend of the woman — who gave a written complaint to the police saying that the man had dragged her minor daughter onto the streets of the market against her will. “We found that the complaint was wrong and filed under pressure,” Devesh Singh, circle officer, Civil Lines, told TOI. “The woman said she had willingly accompanied the man. We have initiated an investigation against Sirohi and several other unidentified members of his organisation.” An FIR was lodged on Saturday night against them for rioting, causing hurt and abetment of offence. No arrest has been made yet. Sirohi said he was not in the wrong: “We only want to ensure anti-social elements do not malign our society."

Till now, over 23.52 lakh doses have been administered in Prayagraj district. Notably, over 13 lakh male and 10 lakh females were covered under the vaccination drive till September 18. According to the health department, on August 31, the number of jabs administered against Covid was 17,90,957, which surged to 23,52,492 on September 18. Altogether, over 5.62 lakh jabs were given in just 18 days of September. Moreover, mega vaccination campaign on September 17 on the occasion of 71th birthday of Prime Minister Narendra Modi had helped health authorities to cover as many as 91,822 jabs were given to eligible recipients in a single day as this was the highest number of vaccination being carried out in any district of the state in a single day. Moreover, in the past 18 days of this month, health staff on an average, were covering over 30,000 recipients in a day either giving first or second dose, and over 51% of targeted recipients have taken jabs in the district so far. Health officials have set a target of 46.10 lakh recipients, including 32 lakh aged between 18 and 44 years and 12.17 lakh above 45 years of age.The number of recipients jabs given till September 18 was 23,52,942 including 18,58,410 of first dose and 4,94,532 of second dose. Earlier, on September 6, a total of 90,696 recipients were covered in a single day during a mega vaccination campaign. The health department had also carried out its district-level vaccination drive on September 10, and covered 59,616 recipients, including 53,588 of first dose and 6,328 of second dose. Officials said that two prime factors including experiences shared by recipients, dismissing of misconceptions about vaccination and its side-effects have helped them cover maximum number ofbeneficiaries and ramping up the exercise. District immunisation officer (DIO) and additional chief medical officer (ACMO) Dr Teerath Lal told TOI that the department’s efforts are underway to ramp up vaccination campaign in each and every part of the district with an objective to cover maximum number of recipients in the coming days.

However, the venue and other details are yet to be finalized,” said Singh. Congress’s Meerut wing is looking for the biggest ground in the city to make Priyanka’s rally super successful. Avnish Kajla, district president of Congress, told TOI that over one lakh people are expected to attend the event. “We have shortlisted three venues, which will be reviewed by Dheeraj Gujjar, Congress state in-charge. The top brass will finalize one of the three choices,” added Kajla. Earlier, the party was planning to start Priyanka’s 12,000km-long ‘pratigya yatra’ on Gandhi Jayanti, on October 2, 2021. “Due to some changes in Priyanka Gandhi’s schedule, we have shifted the launch of the yatra to September 29. We have chosen Meerut as it was the centre point of the country’s first freedom struggle and this time, we are fighting for India’s freedom from the BJP’s dictatorship,” added Kajla. Talking about the yatra, Avnish said that this time, the Congress will not come up with ‘ghoshna patra’ (manifesto), it will introduce ‘vachan patra’ (promise papers). “Hum ab ghoshna nahi karenge, vachan denge. Hum logo k liye kya karenge, wo ab vachan hoga jo tootega nahi (we will not make any announcement now; we will make promises. Promises that we will not break.)” In the 2017 assembly elections, Congress won only seven seats out of 403 in the state. It’s important to mention here that almost every political party is focusing on west UP ahead of assembly polls scheduled early next year. PM Modi also addressed a massive gathering in Aligarh last week, while SP has also started its ‘Brahmin sammelan’ from here.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/priyanka-gandhi-to-kick-start-her-12000-km-yatra-ahead-of-up-polls-from-meerut/articleshow/86349887.cms||Ishita Mishra
---||Ludhiana||Not utilised ineligible ITC? Need not pay penal interest||GST COUNCIL MEETLudhiana: In a relief for the GST taxpayers who were facing penalisation for availing ineligible input tax credit (ITC) even if they had not utilised it, the GST council, in its recent meeting, made some amendments to the provisions related to interest liabilities. According to the new change, those assessees who have availed ineligible ITC but did not utilise it, will not be charged interest. Sometime back, a delegation of city businessmen had raised the issue of innocent businessmen being penalised in case some dealers in the supply chain were involved in bogus billing. The new development will give relief to such businessmen who were paying interest even after reversing the ineligible GST.City’s tax professional NK Thamman said, “The GST council, in its 45th meeting held on September 17, amended provisions related to interest liability retrospectively from July 1, 2017. Earlier, if a taxpayer had availed ineligible ITC, he was required to pay interest on reversal of this ITC even if he had not used it for payment of GST on its supplies. The investigating agency demanded 24% interest (per annum) on such reversals. But now the GST council has proposed to amend this provision and the taxpayer will not be liable to pay interest if he has not utilised the ineligible ITC.”Thamman said, “In case he has utilised the ineligible ITC, he will have to pay 18% interest per annum instead of 24%. In another change, if the taxpayer has utilised part of ineligible ITC for payment of GST on its supplies, then interest will be applicable only on that portion and not the entire amount.”According to Dev Gupta, general secretary of the Induction Furnace Association of North India (IFANI), “A lot more needs to be done to ensure that honest businessmen do not get penalised due to the fault of someone involved in bogus billing, but we appreciate the recent step taken by the GST council. At least some work has started in the direction.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/not-utilised-ineligible-itc-need-not-pay-penal-interest/articleshow/86349885.cms||Mohit Behl
---||Meerut||Thousands throng to see ‘rasam pagdi’ ceremony of new RLD chief Jayant Chaudhary||Meerut: Thousands of people, mostly from the influential Jat community of western Uttar Pradesh, on Sunday gathered in Baghpat to witness the ‘rasam pagdi’ ceremony of Jayant Chaudhary, as he formally stepped into the shoes of his father and former RLD chief Ajit Singh. Performed after over four months of former Union minster’s death, the ceremony saw participation of heads of at least 36 khaps and chief of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) Naresh Tikait. In parts of northern India, ‘rasam pagdi’ ceremony is held to pass on the responsibility of the family or that of the clan to the eldest surviving member, after the death of an elder. During this event, the family member is tied a turban -- signifying honour -- in presence of the members of the family or the clan. Sanjay Kalkhande, head of Kalkhande Khap, said, “After the death of Chaudhary Ajit Singh, this legacy has been handed over to his son, Jayant Chaudhary, who is also the president of RLD. The khap members and his kin tied turban on his head. From now on, Jayant Chaudhary will be called Bade Chaudhary.” The event was also seen as a “show of strength” by RLD ahead of assembly elections in the state. The programme was also attended by Gathwal Khap, which had distanced itself from the recent mahapanchayat held in Muzaffarnagar. “I will continue to ensure that Hindus and Muslims are united in western UP,” Jayant said while addressing the gathering. Choking with emotions, Jayant assured the crowd that he will work “just like his father”. “I will try to fulfill all the responsibilities given to me by all of you. Your support will act as a shield for me,” said Jayant, who added that carrying forward the legacy of his grandfather -- Chaudhary Charan Singh -- and father was not easy. “The most important thing for me is to maintain the Hindu-Muslim brotherhood. I will try my best that they are united,” he added. Later, BKU chief Naresh Tikait said, “We will support Jayant in all possible ways. The elections in 2022 will be fought for farmers.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/thousands-throng-to-see-rasam-pagdi-ceremony-of-new-rld-chief-jayant-chaudhary/articleshow/86349930.cms||Ishita Mishra

---||Ahmedabad||Lifeline sought from PM for Gujarat’s unique ‘swimming camels’||AHMEDABAD: They are fondly called the ‘ship of the desert’ but these unique camels of Gujarat can literally swim — an exceptional trait developed due to the climatic conditions of the Gulf of Kutch. To save the Kharai breed, the Kutch Camel Breeders Association (KCBA) recently wrote to PM Narendra Modi, urging the administration to conserve mangroves in three talukas of Kutch which is the sole grazing area for the camels. The letter dated September 11 sent to Modi and Kutch MP Vinod Chavda requests the government to declare the coastal areas of Bhachau, Abdasa, and Lakhpat as Biodiversity Heritage Sites under the Biological Diversity Act, 2002. The letter also presses for community forest rights under the Forest Rights Act, 2006. Ramesh Bhatti, programme director of Sahajeevan NGO, said that there are about 4,000 Kharai camels in Gujarat, of which 2,000 are in these three talukas of Kutch alone. “The other camels are found in Devbhoomi Dwarka and Jamnagar districts. Kharai camels are identified as a distinct breed by the National Bureau of Animal Genetic Resources,” he said. “The camels have been in the ‘endangered mammals’ category of the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) since March 2019.” The letter signed by Ashabhai Rabari, the president of KCBA, says: “Mangrove forests are dwindling owing to anthropogenic activities.” It goes on to say: “Restrictions of entry for grazing too have threatened the lives and livelihoods of the Maldhari communities viz. Rabari and Fakirani Jat.” Bhikhabhai Rabari, a keeper of Kharai camels, said that the animals have been with his family for three to four generations. “They can swim or wade through shallow waters to reach the mangrove islands off the shore,” he said. “It’s our collective effort to ensure that the corrosion of this fragile ecosystem is not exacerbated.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/lifeline-sought-from-pm-for-gujarats-unique-swimming-camels/articleshow/86352318.cms||Parth Shastri
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat HC quashes bootlegging charges against shopowner||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court has quashed bootlegging charges levelled against an owner of a wine shop situated in the Union territory of Daman with observation that the sale of liquor is permitted in that area and the accused holds a licence to sell liquor. In this case, four persons were caught by Pardi police in Valsad district ferrying more than 1,200 liquor bottles worth Rs 1.12 lakh in a car in March. They were booked under various provisions of the Gujarat Prohibition Act. Since they informed the cops that they had brought liquor from Daman, the FIR also mentioned the unknown wine shop owner as the fifth accused in the case. Later, Hira Valob was booked in the offence. He is the owner of one Lovely Wine Shop in Daman. He was accused of illegally selling liquor in such a huge quantity to other four accused to supply it the nearby dry state of Gujarat. Valob moved the HC for quashing of the charges levelled against him. His advocate referred to the item ledger from the department of Excise, UT administration of Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Damand and Diu for the month of February and March and submitted that the liquor bottles with the batch number mentioned in the FIR were not allotted to Valob’s shop. He was facing allegations for the sale of liquor, which is not prohibitory article in Daman. His is a licence holder of the wine shop and therefore FIR against him is not legal. After considering the facts and circumstances of the case, and taking into account the daily sale of wine under the licence issued to Valob, Justice Gita Gopi came to the conclusion that there is no reason to continue with the criminal proceedings against Valob. HC had suggested Daman’s merger with Gujarat to curb bootlegging As there are widespread accusations against the liquor sellers of Daman that they aid in smuggling liquor to Gujarat in huge quantity, the Gujarat high court in 2011 had suggested to the Centre to merge the Union territory of Daman into the state of Gujarat to effectively enforce prohibition in the dry state. Commenting on poor implementation of prohibition policy, the judge said, “I take judicial notice of the fact that the prohibition policy in Gujarat has not been able to yield positive results. One may not find an open bar on a public street, but the number of cases pending in the different courts in Gujarat bears eloquent testimony to the fact that either the policy is not effective, or something is wrong with the implementation of the law.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-quashes-bootlegging-charges-against-daman-wine-shop-owner/articleshow/86352343.cms||---

---||Hubballi||Karnataka: Bronchiolitis, viral infection on the rise among children||HAVERI/ BALLARI/ HASSAN: Amid mounting fears over the severity of the predicted third wave of Covid-19 and its possible impact on children, whom experts fear are likely to be more susceptible during the pandemic’s third iteration, cases of other pulmonary disorders are on the rise among kids across the state. In Haveri, Ballari and Vijayanagar districts, there has been a disturbing uptick in the number of cases of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, more commonly known as bronchiolitis. That the paediatric wards in government hospitals of the three districts have been full for the past four days attests to the prevalence of the infection. In Ballari, parents were seen waiting with their children on the pavement, owing to the shortage of beds at the government hospital. At the Vijayanagar Institute of Medical Sciences (VIMS), new wards have been set up at the dental college to accommodate the surging crowd. In Haveri, the authorities decided to use the beds in the Covid ward to treat children with viral fever and bronchiolitis that was set up in anticipation of the third wave. “We had set up a 30-bed Covid ward exclusively for children. Since there are no children with Covid at the hospital, we have decided to use the beds to treat those with bronchiolitis. Although there was a huge crowd four days ago, the situation has become more manageable over the past two days, and children are recovering from bronchiolitis and viral fever,” said Dr PR Havanur, Haveri district surgeon. Dr Vilas Hiregoudar, a private paediatrician in Haveri, although admitted to the spike in the number of patients flocking to the OPDs of hospitals, pointed out that the spurt in viral infection cases was a seasonal occurrence. Head of paediatric department at VIMS Dr H Durgappa said that bronchiolitis was common among children aged under two. “It is characterised by acute wheezing, which means that they have to be hospitalised. Usually, treatment for the infection is generally supportive,” Dr Durgappa told TOI. Dr Durgappa appealed to parents to ensure a hygienic atmosphere at home, and adequate ventilation. “Infants must be breast-fed for the first six months,” he added. Common flu cases spike in HassanMeanwhile, in Hassan district, a large number of children have contracted the common flu, and the many common symptoms that this infection shares with Covid-19 has left the parents understandably worried. Paediatricians have been struggling to allay parents’ fears of their wards having contracted Covid-19, and attributed the spike in flu cases to the relaxation of restrictions on the movement of people. Doctors at the Hassan Institute of Medical Sciences (HIMS), where around 70 children are being treated for the flu, pointed out that the infection, while manifesting in kids in the form of cold, cough and fever, it was not severe. “Since most of the restrictions have been lifted and most shops have opened, the common flu virus is spreading unchecked. We have around 42 ventilators in the paediatric ward at HIMC, and we have trained our staff ay primary health centres (PHCs) and community health centres (CHCs) – five beds have been reserved for kids at each PHC and CHC – to handle ventilators,” said Dr Chethan, assistant professor in the paediatric department at HIMS. Head of paediatric department, HIMS Dr Prasanna Kumar said that the change in weather was another reason for the spike in flue cases. “We have tested many of the children infected with flu for Covid-19, and they tested negative. We have made all the necessary arrangements to combat the predicted third wave of Covid-19,” he said. Shashi, father of a two-year-old girl who contracted the flu recently and was treated at HIMS, said, “She had a cough and cold that lasted a week. We gave her a syrup for the cold and cough to no avail. We then took her to the paediatric department, where the doctors prescribed antibiotics and a syrup. If the infection persists even after two days, we have been advised to try nebulisation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/bronchiolitis-viral-infection-on-the-rise-among-children/articleshow/86350075.cms||Basavaraj Maralihalli

---||Delhi||75% of adolescents in East Delhi feel breathlessness, finds study||NEW DELHI: A new report, titled “PM2.5 in ecologically different districts in India: characteristics and health effects,” has revealed that around 75% of adolescents aged between 14 and 17 years in east Delhi complained of breathlessness. Track the pollution level in your cityThe health survey was conducted among 2,427 participants based in six different districts: Ludhiana (industrial), east Delhi (megacity), Vishakhapatnam (coastal), Patiala (agricultural biomass burning), Panchkula (PM2.5 attained- city) and Jaisalmer (desert). According to the study, prepared by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) and supported by the Shakti Sustainable Energy Foundation, PM2.5 mass concentration had crossed the regulatory daily limit of 60 micrograms per cubic metres for the five districts, except Panchkula. In the study, heavy metals were identified as major components of PM2.5 characteristics that may result in potential health effects under prolonged exposure. A health survey on a study group of adolescents from Kendriya Vidyalayas in the age category of 14-17 years (mainly from Classes IX-XII) in the six districts was conducted between June 2019 and March 2020. “During the analysis, it was noted that the highest number of complaints for breathlessness was from Delhi and Patiala, while the highest sneezing and running nose complaints were from Ludhiana. Thus, the effect of bad air (elevated PM2.5 level in highly polluted districts of this study) on respiratory health was evident,” said the study. It stated that in east Delhi district, the maximum number of self-reported respiratory complaints were for breathlessness (75%), itchiness of eyes (24%), sneezing (22%) and cough in the morning (21%). The study revealed that the lockdown restrictions in 2020 resulted in a 39% reduction in PM2.5 concentration in the Delhi region. The mean levels of heavy metals detected in PM2.5 samples were chromium (76.1 ng/m3), copper (147.2 ng/m3), zinc (615.4 ng/m3), molybdenum (278.4 ng/m3) and lead (406.1 ng/m3) in Delhi during October 2019. The study reported toxic metallic elements, such as nickel (4.8 ng/m3), arsenic (11 ng/m3) and cadmium (21 ng/m3), in noticeable quantities. The study also estimated the Heavy Metal Exposure Index (HEI) on the basis of substance priority list given by Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR). HEI shows the most significant potential threat of heavy metals to human health due to their known or suspected toxicity. “HEI estimated in Delhi before lockdown (21.5) was more compared with after lockdown (13.2). In the surveyed six districts, the HEI value was highest in Ludhiana, followed by Delhi,” said the report. Meena Sehgal, project investigator, said, “Prioritising areas for mitigation actions based on toxic pollutants is critical for reducing harmful exposure. Heavy Metal Exposure Index shows some cities have higher exposures and a timeline should be set to control these.” The other team members of the study were Kanhaiya Lal, Mahima Uttereja, Vidhu Gupta, Kiran Shivpuri and Gaurav.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/75-of-adolescents-in-east-delhi-feel-breathlessness-finds-study/articleshow/86352576.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

Petitioner S Balaji’s father was working as a jeep driver at the office of the deputy director of health services in Ramanathapuram district when he died in 2008. Balaji’s mother had submitted an application in 2008 seeking appointment for him on compassionate grounds. Since he was not interested, his mother submitted a second application to the authorities seeking the same for his younger brother in 2019. The authorities had rejected the application on the ground that there is no provision for providing compassionate appointments to alternative legal heirs. Challenging this, Balaji filed the present petition before HC Madurai bench, seeking to provide compassionate appointment to his brother. Observing that the petition was devoid of merits, Justice D Krishnakumar said the petitioner had no locus standi to challenge the order which had rejected compassionate appointment to his brother. However, insofar as the case of the petitioner is concerned, since his name has been considered for compassionate appointment, it is for the petitioner to approach the concerned authorities with all documents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-dismisses-mans-plea-on-compassionate-posting-for-bro/articleshow/86352538.cms||---
---||Madurai||High court acquits seven sentenced to life in murder case||Madurai: Taking into account the inconsistent testimonies of eyewitnesses, Madras high court acquitted seven people who were convicted and sentenced to undergo life imprisonment for allegedly murdering a man in Theni district in 2015. It was the case of the prosecution that deceased Mandhri, a resident of Lakshmipuram village, had lodged a criminal complaint against police constable Rameshkumar which led to the latter’s dismissal from service and consequently enmity between them. Mandhri was village secretary in a political party which had given him the post after removing one Selvam. Hence, there was enmity between Mandhri and Selvam’s family too. The prosecution said that on June 30, 2015 Mandhri arrived in the village from Coimbatore. As he was standing at a tea shop, Rameshkumar, his parents Theivakani and Kodeeshwaran, Selvam, his wife Selvarani, his son Gobikannan and daughter Chandra came to the spot. While the others caught hold of Mandhri, Rameshkumar got a knife from Selvam and allegedly stabbed him. Mandhri was rushed to hospital with severe injuries, but he was declared brought dead. Based on a complaint from Mandhri’s son Pandidurai, Veerapandi police registered a case initially against 10 people. However, on finding during investigation that only eight people were involved in the offence, police filed a final report against them. The eighth accused died during trial. Additional district and sessions judge (fast track court) at Theni convicted and sentenced all seven to life imprisonment in 2018. Challenging the order, they filed criminal appeals before HC Madurai bench. A division bench of Justices V Bharathidasan and S Ananthi observed that the prosecution attributed the murder to two set of accused people having two different motives. The prosecution has not satisfactorily explained as to how these two sets came together and committed the offence, especially in the absence of charge for conspiracy under Section 120(b) of IPC. The judges further observed that testimonies of the eyewitnesses are unreliable and improbable. This creates a doubt regarding the presence of eyewitnesses at the time of occurrence. All the eyewitnesses are interested witnesses as they are closely related to the deceased. Their evidence does not inspire confidence and it will be unsafe to convict the accused based on their inconsistent testimonies. Observing that the prosecution has miserably failed to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt, the judges set aside the conviction and sentence awarded by the trial court and acquitted the seven.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/high-court-acquits-seven-sentenced-to-life-in-murder-case/articleshow/86352513.cms||Kaushik Kannan

A team of archaeologists from the Pandianadu Panpattu Maiyam, including professor T Muneeswaran and professors Lakshmana Moorthy and Aswathaman, had inspected a two-foot-wide and four-foot-long rock on an agriculture land in Karuvelampatti. They got the information from a local man called Surya Prakash. On close inspection, they found that the rock had the 500-year-old Grantha script inscribed on it in four lines. This script is found particularly in Tamil Nadu and Kerala and is said to have originated from the Pallava script. Modern Malayalam is said to be a direct descendant of this script. The script begins with the line which says son of Gopalakrishnan and ends with the word ‘Thammam’. Muneeswaran said that the word ‘Thammam’ may refer to a donation. They were not able to decipher the other lines which looked weathered, he said. A relief sculpture, in which the sculpted elements are seen attached to their background is also seen on the rock. The sculpture is 2ft in width and 3ft in length. There is a sculpture of a man with ornaments on his ears and neck. The female figure has a slanted hair bun (kondai) with long bangles on the hand. Faces of both the sculptures have been damaged and features are not visible. Renowned epigraphist C Santhalingam helped them decipher the inscription, which dates back to the 16th century AD.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/500-year-old-stone-inscription-with-grantha-script-found-in-madurai/articleshow/86352544.cms||---

Cops recovered the call detail record (CDR) on the mobile number linked to the vehicle number/e-challan and tracked down the family. The burnt man was N Sudheer (39), an orthopaedic doctor from KPHB colony. “He had left his KPHB house at around 6.30 pm without telling exactly where he was going. From KPHB, he took the ORR at Gachibowli and the fire started in the sedan at Pedda Golconda,” Shamshabad SI K Satya Kumar said. The incident happened around 8pm and the car was engulfed in flames before he could stop. By the time fire engine doused the flames around 8.45pm, he was charred. Police suspect that his seat belt must have been stuck and the doors jammed, trapping him inside. “The legs, hands and head were charred. The remaining body was stuck to the rods of the burnt seat. It was with great difficulty that we removed the body from the car,” a Shamshabad cop said. Soon after the incident, DCP N Prakash Reddy and other senior officials reached the spot. But identifying the victim became a challenge as his mobile phone and wallet were also reduced to ashes. Luckily, the number plate of the car survived the blaze as it had got detached. Covered in soot, cops cleaned it to identify the vehicle number, which led them to the pending e-challan and the phone number linked to it. Cops accessed the CDR to reach out to the doctor’s sister who was the last person he spoke to.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/car-blaze-challan-helps-cops-identify-charred-doctor/articleshow/86354765.cms||---

The city and suburbs have been receiving intermittent heavy showers leading to water logging on the roads. Adding to the woes is the heavy traffic flow that has damaged most of the roads. The East Marret Street has been damaged for a stretch of about one kilometer from Vilakuthoon to Yannaikkal junction. The top layer of the road has been peeled off, giving a very rough ride to the people. The Smart City zone is less than one kilometer away from this road. People demanded the corporation to give importance to this road, as it leads to a trading area in the city. As the road also functions as an open market, waste also enters the potholed road during rain making it slippery. All the three Chittrakara streets have also been badly damaged and to make things worse, rain results in inundation. Often people fall into the water, where the potholes are deeper. Madurai Corporation commissioner Dr K P Karthikeyan said that a comprehensive report and DPR to re-lay various damaged roads had been sent to the government. “We are expecting to get the approval soon. Once it is received, tenders would be floated and re-laying would be done,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/rain-worsens-state-of-roads-in-madurai/articleshow/86352580.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Seek fresh mandate, YSRC asks TDP MLAs||Amaravati: Irrigation minister Anil Kumar Yadav dared TDP supremo Chandrababu Naidu to have his 19 legislators quit the assembly and seek a fresh mandate from the people. The minister said the results of the ZPTC elections have once again proved that chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy has a place in the heart of commoners. Speaking to the media at the party office here, Yadav rubbished TDP state president K Atchannaidu’s demand for fresh assembly elections. “We won panchayat elections, municipal elections and swept the ZPTC and MPTC elections held in April. TDP was nowhere in the contest as the party candidates have lost deposits in Naidu’s Kuppam constituency. So, TDP should make its 19 legislators resign and seek fresh mandate if they have confidence of winning the elections,” the minister said. He claimed that no section of the society is with TDP as the party has been creating trouble for the government ever since Jagan Mohan Reddy took over the reins of the state. Yadav said Naidu and his son Lokesh lost the public’s support as people realised that the father-son duo were interested only in raising litigations. The minister said TDP fielded candidates in the ZPTC elections and also campaigned till the polls were abruptly postponed by former state election commissioner SEC Nimmagadda Ramesh Kumar. He said TDP forced Nimmagadda to conduct panchayat and municipal elections ahead ofthe ZPTC elections, hoping to win at least a few seats. “After seeing YSRC candidates winning 82% of seats in panchayats and municipal elections, the TDP suddenly announced boycott of the ZPTC elections. They realised that winning the public mandate is difficult,” said the minister. Agriculture minister Kurasala Kannababu said the people have reposed their faith in YS Jagan Mohan Reddy government’s welfare initiatives as they backed YSRC candidates in all districts. He said TDP could not win decent numbers only because of Naidu’s tricks to weaken Jagan’s strong base. YSRC spokesperson Ambati Rambabu said it was high time that the TDP dissolved the party as it has lost all the elections held since Jagan Mohan Reddy assumed office. “TDP’s embarrassing defeat in Kuppam should be an eye-opener for the TDP activists across the state. The party has no future under Naidu and Lokesh,” said Rambabu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/seek-fresh-mandate-ysrc-asks-tdp-mlas/articleshow/86350337.cms||Samdani MN
---||Ahmedabad||Ford’s exit a setback for Motown Sanand||Ford Motor Company’s sudden exit from its India business and the shutting down of car production at its Sanand facility came as a rude shock to employees and dealers. It is also a setback to Gujarat, which has worked hard to make its mark on the auto map of India. The American auto giant last week announced that it would shut its two manufacturing plants — one at Sanand in Gujarat and another at Chennai in Tamil Nadu — starting from the fourth quarter of 2021. However, the engine manufacturing at its Sanand plant, some 40km from Ahmedabad, will continue. Ford’s adieu is the second major exit of an automobile giant after General Motors, which exited the state after selling its plant at Halol to MG Motor India, a subsidiary of China’s SAIC Motor Corp. "The automobile industry is already facing a demand slowdown since the pandemic and, given the chip shortage, production has slowed too. Ford’s exit coming at such a time will certainly dampen sentiment of auto ancillary investors into Sanand in the near-term. However, with production and demand improving in the longer term, investments are bound to pour in," said Chintan Thaker, chairman, Assocham Gujarat state council. The sudden announcement that came following dipping sales and mounting losses, did send ripples among dealer circuits and left workers concerned about their future. "Over the last decade, the Indian auto industry has experienced an extended slowdown. Originally projected to reach 70 lakh units between 2010 and 2020, the industry managed less than half of the projections. The capacity utilization with Ford stood at less than 20% of its installed assets," said a Ford India spokesperson. "This combined with ongoing uncertainty in the long-term growth prospects of the auto industry and economy have resulted in serious challenges. These, combined with 20 years of accumulated losses totalling about $2 billion, led to Ford’s decision," the spokesperson said. Ford had invested Rs 4,000 crore in the two plants at Sanand, where a total of 1,600 persons are currently employed. Workers in the lurchFord’s move to shut production at Sanand plant within next three months has left its workers in the lurch. Vijay Bacodra, president, Karnavati Kamdar Ekta Sangh, and also a worker at Ford’s Sanand facility, said, "Employees are left with only three months to find a new job. We have been informed that the plant will shut by December this year." Many workers at the plant have taken home loans or are the sole providers of their families. "Four months ago, I took a home loan, and I was looking forward to an increment. However, such a sudden decision by the company will come as a huge blow because I am the only earning member of my family," a worker at the Ford’s Sanand facility said on the condition of anonymity. Yet another worker told TOI, "When the announcement came, I spoke to a few friends in other companies asking for jobs. But due to the chip shortage, most companies have cut production and are therefore not hiring new people. I don’t know when I will ever get a new job if I am to quit working here." Concerns over inventories piling upAs Ford India announced the shutting of vehicle manufacturing in India, dealers are concerned about getting rid of existing inventory. The company has a network of some 22 dealerships across Gujarat, according to estimates by Federation of Automobile Dealers’ Association (FADA). "Dealers have invested Rs 200 crore already and they have an inventory worth at least Rs 150 crore. The company’s sudden decision to shut its plant will dampen consumer sentiments and demand for Ford cars may take a hit. In such cases, dealers will be the ones to bear acute losses as it will compel them to sell cars at hefty discounts," said Pranav Shah, chairman – Gujarat region, FADA. Industry estimates suggest that at least 1,000 people employed at these dealerships may lose their jobs. "Some 20% of the existing bookings have already been cancelled after the shutdown announcement. We are waiting to see how the situation unfolds. The company, however, will be giving a support package to cover infrastructure and other costs," said a Ford car dealer. "We have started discussion with the union and dealers and will update stakeholders after we arrive at an agreement on all important matters including severance, dealer compensation," said a Ford India spokesperson. Challenges multiplyAs the demand for passenger cars declined post-pandemic, the automobile industry, which was already reeling from a slowdown, took a further hit. With the global semiconductor shortage, automobile manufacturers have downsized production, which in turn affects auto component manufacturers. According to data by Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation (GIDC), Gujarat is home to at least 200 auto component manufacturing units that make machine tools, brass parts for automobiles, engine and electric motors, bearings, tyres and other auto components. Industry players suggest that ancillary units, which were battling challenges, will further feel the heat with Ford’s exit. "Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) don’t have deep pockets and amidst a dearth of orders, servicing debts becomes a challenge. While this will affect the short-term investment sentiment, in the longer run, as India needs more hubs for automobile manufacturing, Gujarat is sure set to gain," said Vinnie Mehta, director general, Auto Component Manufacturers’ Association (ACMA).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/fords-exit-a-setback-for-motown-sanand/articleshow/86352608.cms||Niyati Parikh

The discovery is also proof that the inhabitants of Keeladi had expertise in water management over 2,600 years ago, experts say. The ring wells, which have been assumed to have been used for conserving water, were unearthed at the Keeladi site right from the first phase in 2014-15. So far 23 ring wells have been found. The well unearthed in the sixth phase had 32 terracotta rings and was the tallest discovered so far at the current site. Sources from the Tamil Nadu State Archaeology Department said that they have discovered seven ring wells in the seventh phase which began on February 19 this year. They were interesting because they had terracotta rings which were designed intricately. Last week, archaeologists discovered three ring wells close to each other - one is seen below another, while the other is a few feet away in the same quadrant. Sundaram Climate Institute founder Mridula Ramesh said that ring wells discovered in several other digs were water related structures and were once common in 4-5 centuries BC. Keeladi has already revealed that the people of this ancient civilization managed their water with expertise. They had different kinds of channels which may have indicated that they transported water too. Ring wells may have been used as soak pits or draw wells. Their presence sometimes indicates that the river flowed close by.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/7th-phase-excavation-at-keeladi-draws-to-a-close/articleshow/86352599.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: 54-year-old Lake Town realtor jumps off Maa flyover to death||KOLKATA: A 54-year-old realtor from Pallysree area of Lake Town reportedly ended his life by jumping off the Garia-bound flank of Maa flyover around 6.15am on Sunday. Pranab Kundu, a morning walker and an animal lover, was last spotted leaving his home on his two-wheeler at 4.35am as per his usual routine, according to his neighbours. Cops suspect that the man might have been grappling with a severe financial stress due to the pandemic, which prompted him to kill himself. However, cops have not ruled out the possibility of some personal tension behind his suicide. His two-wheeler was found parked on the flyover. “We found the victim lying unconscious on the service Road close to the main entry gate of Milan Mela under the Maa flyover. We rushed him to the NRS Hospital where he was declared brought dead. His bike was found parked on the Maa Flyover near the Garia down ramp. A pair of slippers and a helmet belonging to the victim were also found beside the bike. We identified the victim with the help of the documents that he was carrying with him,” said DC (East) Gaurav Lal. Cops said that they would wait for the post-mortem report to ascertain the cause behind his death as the spot of the flyover, from where he jumped, did not have any CCTV coverage. Since 2019, this was for the second time that a man jumped off the flyover. So far, this was the third suicide from the flyover, according to the police. Kundu is survived by his wife and son, an engineer. Cops will speak to his family members while the inquest proceedings have been initiated. Kundu, the youngest of his three brothers, was also an engineer. Pranab Kundu's house at Lake Town“He had been associated with realty business and ran his office from his ancestral house where his extended families live. There was no CCTV coverage of the area from where Kundu jumped. This is the second time that a person reportedly jumped from this part of Maa flyover since 2019 and the third such suicide overall on the flyover. The police said they will speak to the family even as inquest proceedings have been initiated. He stayed at a five-storey building where all the flats are shared by his relatives,” said a relative.  The family had settled in the area six decades ago when Kundu’s grandfather had built the house. Kundu, who fed stray dogs around Salt Lake and Lake Town, was respected in the area. The elder brother of the victim said they were not aware about Kundu’s financial problems. “He was perfectly normal even on Saturday. He spoke less and had an extremely selective group of friends,” he told TOI. His another brother is settled in Pune. Dipak Dey, a neighbour, said, “He used to go towards the Salt Lake side for morning walk. After coming back, he used to go to the local market and chat with some friends and feed the strays. On Sunday, we saw him leaving the house.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/54-year-old-lake-town-realtor-jumps-off-maa-flyover-to-death/articleshow/86352630.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Hyderabad||MLC wins Rs 19 lakh laddu at auction, gifts it to Andhra Pradesh CM YS Jagan Mohan Reddy||HYDERABAD: The famous Balapur laddu was knocked down on Sunday for Rs 18.9 lakh, the highest-ever auction price, as an MLC from Rayalaseema and his Telangana business partner joined the bidding to gift the ‘prasadam’ to AP chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy. The MLC, RV Ramesh Yadav, belongs to the YSRCP. This is the first time that the Balapur laddu, which weighs 21kg, auctioned on the day of immersion of the idols of Lord Ganesh is being gifted to AP chief minister post-bifurcation of the state. The move has surprised many a political pundit as it comes at a time when the relations between the two Telugu states are at the lowest over Krishna water dispute. It also gains significance as Jagan’s sister YS Sharmila has launched a new political party in Telangana and is actively touring the state. Interestingly, the joint successful bidder, Marri Shashank Reddy, is a native of Nadergul in Telangana. Also, this is the first time that a politician from Rayalaseema region of AP has participated in the laddu auction in the past 26 years. Jagan Mohan Reddy hails from the region. The laddu offered to Lord Ganesh is considered auspicious and the winner of the bid distributes it among close relatives for their well-being and prosperity. Ramesh Yadav and Shashank Reddy are partners in an education consultancy firm. The MLC will now take the laddu to Vijayawada to give it to Jagan. With the MLC from Kadapa joining the fray this time, the bidding went on briskly and people watched with political interest over the outcome. Finally, the laddu fetched Rs 1.3 lakh more than that of the 2019 auction when it got Rs 17.6 lakh. There was no auction in 2020 due to pandemic and incidentally the laddu was presented to Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao. Jagan became the third chief minister to receive the Balapur laddu. It was also presented to TDP president and former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu in 2013 even as the agitation over separate Telangana was in full swing. Around 15 people participated in the auction with the bid starting at 1,116. While many backed out after the bid touched Rs 10 lakh, the Rayalaseema leader and his business partner continued with their bid till no one challenged them. Ramesh is from the BC (Yadav) community. He is the first Yadav to become an MLC after K Ramaiah in 1962. Ramesh Yadav told TOI that he had tried to take part in 2019 laddu auction, but could not due to various reasons. “I was hopeful of bidding it in 2020 but there was no auction due to pandemic restrictions. It’s a tough competition and finally I have won it,” he said. He said since Jagan had made him an MLC it was his privilege to gift the famous Balapur laddu to the latter. Shashank Reddy said he was trying for an appointment of K Chandrasekhar Rao to show him the Balapur laddu and take his blessings.

---||Delhi||Pilot project: 15 Delhi govt schools to get health clinics by October||NEW DELHI: Fifteen Delhi government schools will soon have “school health clinics”, where children will be provided with physical and mental health services. With the schools reopening gradually, the government is hoping to inaugurate the clinics on October 1. The setting up of the school health clinics, on the lines of the popular mohalla clinics, was announced by the government in 2018. Now, as a pilot project, these are being started in 15 schools located in various districts of the city. The earlier plan was to set up such clinics in 265 Delhi government schools. A n order sent to the schools stated: "The government of NCT of Delhi has set new standards of development in our country by revolutionising the fields of primary healthcare and education. The Aam Aadmi Mohalla Clinics provide easily accessible world-class primary healthcare facilities, including diagnosis, treatment and prevention, for free, to people at large. The departments of health and education are coming together to synergise and expand their horizons to provide physical and mental health services to children through School Health Clinics (sic)." Just like mohalla clinics, these school health clinics will also be housed in porta-cabins. They will be located on premises and be exclusively used for students. The Public Works Department will complete the installation of furniture and fixtures, along with readying the electricity and water connections in the porta-cabins. “The clinics will have expert counsellors and doctors. Teachers can also use this facility. Students will get tested and their complete health record will be maintained here,” said an education department official. This is the second such health centre being built in Delhi government schools. Recently, the government had inaugurated the district resource centre for children with special needs. Close to 31 such centres are to be established in different districts. These centres are also operated by private organisations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pilot-project-15-govt-schools-to-get-health-clinics-by-oct/articleshow/86352997.cms||---

---||Kolkata||23-day-old dies of ‘suffocation’||Kolkata: A 23-day-old baby girl died on Saturday minutes after her mother, who was weak following a caesarian delivery, went off to sleep beside her in the Dhapa area. Several pillows were kept around the baby, born to Aparna and Uttam Das, when she was sleeping. Her parents, residents of Ramkrisnapally in Madhyamgram, were staying at the maternal uncle’s house of the woman at Uchupota near Khanberia in the Dhapa area. The woman reportedly fell asleep on a cot with the baby beside her around 3.30pm. In the evening, when she woke up to feed the baby, she found her unconscious. The baby was taken to NRS Hospital and Medical College where she was declared dead around 12.30am on Sunday. A police officer said, “Prima facie, it seems that the baby died of suffocation after a pillow fell on her face.” Cops also suspect that the baby, who might have been wrapped in a kantha, pulled it over her face. Unable to bear the loss of her child, Aparna fell unconscious several times. An office of Pragati Maidan police station said her statement would be recorded once she recovered from the shock.

---||Amaravati||YSRCP sweeps 13 zilla parishads, 90% mandals in Andhra Pradesh||AMARAVATI: Making a clean sweep, the ruling YSRCP captured all the 13 zilla parishads and over 90% of mandal parishads in the state. The results of elections to Zilla Parishad Territorial Constituencies (ZPTC) and Mandal Parishad Territorial Constituencies (MPTC) held in April were declared on Sunday after the completion of counting of votes which were delayed due to court cases. This is the first time that a ruling party has won all the ZPs in the state. YSRCP candidates left no room for confusion anywhere in the state as they trounced rival candidates with huge margins. The TDP could not win double digit ZPTCs in any district to get the status of principal opposition in the rural local bodies. The TDP had fielded candidates and campaigned for several months, but later abruptly quit the battlefield after the defeat in panchayat and municipal elections. Many TDP candidates continued in the fray by defying party decision, but lost. The ruling party’s performance comes after its resounding success earlier in panchayat and municipal polls where it had won over 83% seats in elections held in February. The State Election Commission (SEC) has now issued notification for elections of chairpersons to the zilla parishad and mandal parishad. ZPTC members will elect the ZP chief on September 25. The election of two vice-chairpersons and co-option members for ZP will also be held on the same day. The MPTC members will elect mandal parishad chairpersons on September 24. The counting for the polls held in April were taken up by the SEC on Sunday after the AP high court division bench cleared the decks for declaration of results last week. Barring a few minor incidents, the counting was completed peacefully. Counting was delayed in a few centres as ballots were damaged in rain water as well as due to termites. SEC asked the local returning officers and district collectors to take a call on counting of damaged ballots. YSRCP candidates won nearly 23% of ZPTCs uncontested. YSRCP candidates won all the 52 seats in Kurnool zilla parishad without leaving a single seat for the opposition. While YSRC won 16 seats uncontested, it captured all the remaining 36 seats in polling. Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy’s home district of YSR Kadapa too returned massive results for the ruling side as it captured the ZP for the second consecutive term. YSRCP candidates won 49 out of 50 seats in the Kadapa ZP. The ruling party had won the ZP much before polling as it snatched 38 seats unanimously. TDP won only one of the 12 seats which went to polls. TDP supremo Chandrababu Naidu’s home turf Chittoor also handed massive victories to YSRCP, as it won 63 of the 65 ZPTCs. Elections in two seats were suspended due to the death of candidates. YSRCP won 30 seats unanimously and 33 in election.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/ysrcp-sweeps-13-zilla-parishads-90-mandals-in-andhra/articleshow/86354783.cms||Samdani MN

Sanjay claimed that chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao was trying to portray a positive image of the state after home minister Amit Shah’s meeting in Nirmal. “The intelligence wing has informed the CM that the Nirmal meeting has been a success. So, he is frightened. But as long as he is the CM, no one in the state will get a job. But one more member of his family would get a post soon,” he said Sanjay also enquired whether CM KCR supported the triple talaq bill or not. “In this state, the government is creating problems for the majority community by prohibiting them from celebrating festivals,” he claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/kcr-afraid-after-shah-nirmal-rally-sanjay/articleshow/86354442.cms||---

By-lanes in Old City, Ranigunj, Saidabad, Koti, Musheerabad, Chikadpally, SR Nagar, Moosapet were among the most-affected areas due to Ganesh immersion processions across the city. Hyderabad police did impose traffic restrictions in various parts of city from Saturday itself keeping in view of the Ganesh immersion processions. Motorists going towards Hi-Tec City were stuck on the lane beside Railway Goods Shed Road in Moosapet for almost half-hour while waiting for a procession to move. “I waited for almost quite some time before taking a U-turn and taking another route to go on the other side of the road. We had to travel an additional 2 kms just to go on the other side of the road where the procession was blocking the road,” said Sai Prashanth, a resident of Aanjaneya Nagar colony in Moosapet. The situation was similar at an arterial road near Kotla Vijaya Bhaskara Reddy indoor stadium in Yousufguda. Covid protocols tossed aside Many who took part in immersion of idols on Sunday were seen violating Covid-19 protocols. At many places, people were seen shoving each other through the crowds, without maintaining any distance, to reach the vantage points to get a good view of the idols. At places like Charminar, Moazzam Jahi market, Basheer Bagh, Begum Bazaar and Tank Bund roads, devotees were dancing together to the music without wearing face masks or maintaining social distancing norms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/despite-arrangements-processions-choke-traffic/articleshow/86354608.cms||---

A total of 46,846 people received the jab in rural areas and 23,802 in city corporation limits.  “More locations chosen carefully by allowing residents to get the jab nearer to their houses and publicity measures have helped overachieve our target,” P M N Mujibur Rahman, commissioner, Trichy corporation said. Through sponsors, the civic body had announced Rs 60,000 worth of prizes including gold coins, bicycles and silk saris. In Madurai, finance minister P T R Palanivel Thiagarajan inspected the vaccination camp at Subbarayalu memorial middle school at Shenoy Nagar in the presence of collector S Aneesh Sekhar and corporation commissioner K P Karthikeyan.

---||Hyderabad||Cong moots Oppn unity with eye on assembly, LS polls||Hyderabad: Congress is trying to bring all anti-TRS and anti-BJP parties together in the run up to the 2023 assembly and 2024 general elections. The first of the opposition meetings was held at Gandhi Bhavan on Sunday with the state chiefs of Telangana Congress, CPI, CPM, TJS, CPI-ML-New Democracy 1 and 2, CPIML- Liberation, Telangana Inti Party attending it. The meeting decided that all opposition parties together would launch an agitation from October 5 onwards on issues mainly, including podu land, lakhs of acres of land not registered on Dharani portal and TRS government acquiring parcels of land assigned to Dalits by the successive Congress governments over the years. The opposition also decided to launch joint agitations against BJP and TRS governments over rising prices of petrol, diesel, domestic gas, Pegasus phone tapping, privatisation of public sector undertakings, monetisation, and the three farm laws. On the face of it, Congress is trying to project the opposition parties’ meeting as one to seek support for its Maha Dharna at Indira Park on September 22 in support of farmers and Bharat Bandh on September 27 in tune with the call given by AICC to state PCCs, against anti-people policies of BJP government at the centre, and other parties in the ruling in respective states. Sources said that Congress plan is to bring all anti-BJP and anti-TRS parties on a single platform and launch series of agitations jointly on various issues against the two governments up to 2023 polls. A team of senior and young leaders from Congress would also get in touch with civil society organisations, employee associations and various caste welfare organisations, seeking their support. Political analysts said while it is the right time to start efforts to bring opposition parties under an umbrella, the challenge would be to to keep the flock together for two years when the state is expected to go to elections. Box: 1 YSRTP, Jana Sena, TDP and BSP did not attend the opposition meet though invitations were sent to them. Congress leaders said efforts will continue to bring them too to the future meetings. The meeting convened by Telangana Congress on Sunday was attended by TPCC chief A Revanth Reddy CPI and CPM state secretaries Chada Venkat Reddy and Tammineni Veerabhadram, Telangana Jana Samithi president M Kodandaram, CPI-ML secretary S Ranga Rao, Telangana Inti Party chief Cheruku Sudhakar and Govardhan of New Democracy. Box: 2 TPCC chief Revanth Reddy said an all-party Maha Dharna on farmers’ issues will be held at Indira Park on September 22 and Bharat Bandh on September 27. Prominent leaders and activists of opposition parties would lead the Bharat Bandh protest on national highways connecting Hyderabad.

---||Hyderabad||After pandemic lull, Hyderabad bids Ganesha a grand adieu||HYDERABAD: After a lull in festivities last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the city was buzzing on the final day of Ganesh Chatruthi celebrations on Sunday. Chants of ‘Ganpati Bappa Moriya’ reverberated from all the major water bodies in the city as thousands thronged the streets to bid adieu to the jumbo god. Devotees were seen throwing colours in the air and dancing along the procession routes with troupes of drummers accompanying them as the 10-day festival came to an end. The immersion procession — Shoba Yatra — began early in the morning amid elaborate security arrangements. Heavy rain in the evening could not dampen the spirits of devotees who continued with immersion proceedings with fervour. “The procession slowed down a little for a while but continued without any hassle. Arrangements have been made by authorities to ensure everything goes smoothly,” said G Balraju, a traffic official. Idols in different sizes and forms were carefully placed on decorated trucks, cars and other vehicles that passed through some of the major thoroughfares such as Charminar, Moazzam Jahi market, Begum Bazaar, Basheer Bagh, Khairtabad and other areas. Around 27,000 policemen were deployed under the limits of Hyderabad, Cyberabad and Rachakonda commissionerates as lakhs took part in the immersion procession of nearly 40,000 idols in Hussainsagar and other water bodies across the twin cities. While idols larger than 10 feet were being immersed from Tank Bund side, the smaller idols were diverted towards People’s Plaza and other points around Hussain Sagar. The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) has installed 330 cranes of various capacities at 33 lakes and 28 special ponds were created for immersion. As many as 40 cranes have been deployed for immersion at Hussainsagar. To provide help in case of any drowning incidents, authorities also deployed boats with 30 expert swimmers at the water body.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/after-pandemic-lull-city-bids-ganesha-a-grand-adieu/articleshow/86354580.cms||Moulika.KV

The immersion processions started to roll from the afternoon onwards on the penultimate day of the 10-day Ganesha festival. Soon roads in the old city started to fill with devotees who braved the showers and ignored discomfort to see the colourful tableaux. To ensure that devotees adhere to the laid down Covid-19 guidelines, police personnel were deployed at every corner of the city. Along with physical surveillance, several drones also kept an eye on the processions in the old city area. Though devotees were seen dancing to the DJ music and playing ‘garba’, the celebrations were much subdued this time compared to the previous years. Many Ganesha pandal organizers preferred to immerse the idols in their areas, while hundreds headed towards the artificial pond in Navlakhi Grounds. Cops said that no untoward incident was reported during the immersion processions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/rain-soaked-devotees-bid-teary-adieu-to-ganesha/articleshow/86349718.cms||---

The Sun City laddu became the most-expensive laddu ever in open auctions replacing the famous Balapur laddu. The Sun City laddu was bought by residents of Richmond Villas for an eye-watering Rs 41 lakh at the open auction held on its premises. “82 of the 179 villas on the premises took part in the open auction to buy the laddu. In 2019, the laddu fetched Rs 18.7 lakh while in 2020, Ganpati laddu was auctioned at Rs 27.3 lakh,” Abhay Deshpande, a resident of Richmond Villas told TOI. The laddu will be distributed among the flat owners, he said. Meanwhile, a businessman K Vijayabhaskar Reddy who recently bought a flat at MyHome Bhooja in Gachibowli, bought two Ganpati laddus for Rs 18.5 lakh in an open auction, just Rs 40,000 less than the Balapur laddu. Elsewhere, the wife of TPCC working president and Sangareddy T Jagga Reddy bought a laddu for Rs 10 lakh at an open auction held by Chaitanya Yuvajana Samithi. At other auctions, a laddu was bought for Rs 4.1 lakh by Srinivas Reddy in Vanasthalipuram while the open auction for laddu at the Mayflower Heights in Mallapur fetched a winning bid of Rs 3.16 lakh by an industrialist, Madhu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sun-city-laddu-sets-all-time-auction-record/articleshow/86354579.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Shoppers stream into markets and malls, rush reminds traders of pre-Covid days||KOLKATA: With only three Sundays left before Chaturthi, a large number of people, armed with umbrellas and masks that were either hanging from the chins or crumpled inside pockets, thronged the shopping hubs across the city. Retailers said that with the number of Covid cases still under control, shoppers thronged the traditional marketplaces like New Market, Gariahat and Hatibagan alongside shopping malls in different parts of the city, making the most of the weekend, despite sporadic showers. “We still don’t know whether pandal hopping will be allowed this year but that cannot stop us from wearing new clothes. No matter how much you shop online, puja shopping is never complete unless you jostle with shoppers on a Sunday evening,” said Pooja Datta, a resident of Kasba, who was spotted at Gariahat on Sunday with her mother and sister.  South City mall on SundayThe rain and better sanitisation also tilted the balance slightly towards the malls as every major shopping mall, from South City in the south to City Centre in the north, were packed with shoppers. The eateries also saw good business due to the crowds on Sunday. South City clocked 85,000 footfall where car management proved to be a major challenge with the parking lots, that has a capacity of 1,200-odd vehicles, were chock-a-block around early afternoon. By evening, there was almost a one-km-long car queue on Prince Anwar Shah Road and it was a challenge for the cops to manage the traffic.  Inside, it was hard to find a vacant chair at the food court in the peak evening hour. “Footfall this weekend has been close to 60,000 each day. But on Sunday, the number soared up to 85,000 with more than 4,500 cars entering the parking lot. The apparels and footwear sections have been the major drivers, apart from the food court,” said a South City mall official. Acropolis Mall that had clocked 25,000 plus footfall on Saturday was yet to ascertain the exact number for Sunday but an official said it was much more than Saturday’s. “We are inching closer to pre-pandemic footfall. Our retailers are happy as serious shoppers are purchasing merchandise from their favourite brands and are also thronging the food court and fine dining restaurants,” said an official. Officials of Mani Square said they had a footfall of around 55,000 plus shoppers while City Centre I and II officials said there was a substantial rise in the number of shoppers on Sunday than Saturday and earlier weekends, which had seen around 40,000-odd shoppers. “Sunday was only the second time since the second wave of the pandemic that I stepped into a mall. The last time I was here, I had quickly picked up a couple of ties for a set of webinars and had left. On Sunday I was at the City Centre mall with my family and we even had lunch besides shopping,” said Arijit Bose, a techie. Traders at Gariahat, Hatibagan and New Market said the rush reminded them of pre-pandemic days when people used to shop for hours without caring about crowding. “In fact, the shops with more crowds were favoured by the shoppers. Old scenes were back at the market on Sunday,” said Indrajit Das, a hawker at Gariahat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/shoppers-stream-into-markets-and-malls-rush-reminds-traders-of-pre-covid-days/articleshow/86352673.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

---||Lucknow||Early diagnosis key to frozenshoulder treatment: Experts||Lucknow: Don’t ignore shoulder pain, stiffness or difficulty in movement of arm if any of this persists for 15-20 days as it could be an early sign of periarthritis, commonly known as frozen shoulder, according to experts. Speaking at a symposium on ‘Problems of shoulder joint and its management,’ organised by UP Orthopaedic Association (UPOA) on Sunday, the association’s secretary and head, sports medicine at KGMU, Prof Ashish Kumar, said: “People start experiencing mild symptoms including pain and stiffness when the periarthritis (frozen shoulder) begins.” “However, since as the pain does not pose much of a problem in the early stage, people tend to ignore it. They usually come to us when hand mobility is reduced to 12-15 degrees. If a patient comes to us in the early stage, the problem can be treated with physiotherapy, supportive treatment along with some medicines, otherwise surgical intervention is a must,” he added. Dr Vinay Pandey, orthopaedic surgeon from Varanasi, said the problem was common in people above 40 years of age, those with shoulder injury or diabetes. “It is caused due to tightening of tissues around the bone of the shoulder. Often patients report with severe frozen shoulders. We have to then perform arthroplasty, which is a minimally invasive technique to detect tightening tissue and remove it,” he added. Dr Uttam Garg, the co-organising secretary of the symposium, said: “Advance treatments for this problem are available but it is significant that everyone should know about the early signs.” Highlighting the importance of public awareness, KGMU vice-chancellor Lt Gen Prof Bipin Puri, who was the chief guest on the occasion, said such programmes helped the medical fraternity and people aware and updated, which ultimately resulted in better patient care.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/early-diagnosis-key-to-frozenshoulder-treatment-experts/articleshow/86354414.cms||---
---||Trichy||150 acres of temple land encroached in Tiruvarur: ASI||Thanjavur: About 150 acres of land belonging to Bhaktavatsala Perumal Temple at Thirukkannamangai in Tiruvarur district may have been encroached, according to the deputy superintending epigraphist of Archaeological Survey of India, K Panneerselvam. His observation is based on inscriptions in the copper plate of the temple which has been found to be in the safe custody of the joint commissioner of HR and CE department in Thanjavur. The ASI official was conducting a survey of various temples on the direction of the Madras high court which had heard a public interest litigation petition stating that the copper plate containing details of donation of land was missing from the temple. Panneerselvam said he had found it inscribed in the copper plate that King Vijayaragunatha Nayak donated 400 acres of land to the temple in 1608. “The copper plate containing these details is with the office of the joint commissioner of HR and CE in Thanjavur. We have learnt from the inscription that 150 acres of land may have been encroached,” he said. He said he will submit a report quantifying the land donated by the king for daily temple pujas, the extent of land available with the temple now and with the encroachers to the HR & CE department for further action. It may be recalled that based on the PIL claiming that the copper plate had gone missing from the temple, the high court had asked Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to examine all inscriptions at temples in Tamil Nadu that were left unregistered. Subsequently, a team of officials headed by K Panneerselvam conducted the survey at various temples including Vethapuriswarar temple in Thirivethikudi in Thanjavur on Sunday. A report in this regard will be submitted to the state government, he added. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/150-acres-of-temple-land-encroached-in-tiruvarur-asi/articleshow/86352723.cms||---
---||Trichy||Farmers have to wait for 15 days at DPCs to sell produce: EPS||Trichy: Opposition leader Edappadi K Palaniswami has urged the state government to procure kuruvai paddy from farmers at all the direct procurement centres (DPCs). He said farmers are being forced to wait for more than 15 days after getting tokens to sell their produce at the DPCs making them incur heavy losses. “The officials at the direct procurement centres are being threatened by DMK party men who say they should procure paddy only from the farmers indicated by them,” he said in a statement here on Sunday. “Since there is delay at the centres to procure paddy, the paddy bags brought by farmers to the DPCs go waste as they get drenched in rain and germinate. This causes heavy loss to farmers,” the statement said. “I requested the government in the assembly to purchase paddy only from farmers who come with certificate issued by the village administration officers. But this situation has not changed in many purchasing centres. Farmers continue to have to wait at least 15 days to sell their produce at the purchasing centres.” “Several direct procurement centres functioning from the districts where paddy production was abundant have been closed. For the benefit of farmers, all the centres should be opened and procurement should be speeded up. The required number of gunny bags should also be made available at the centres to facilitate the procurement,” the statement added. Meanwhile, farmers have appealed to increase the moisture content of paddy grains to 22 from 17 while procuring. “Following cyclones and unseasonal rains, paddy with 22% moisture was procured from farmers last year. That should be followed during this current year too,” said All Farmers Association's Coordination Committee member P R Pandian.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/farmers-have-to-wait-for-15-days-at-dpcs-to-sell-produce-eps/articleshow/86352739.cms||---

The two, aged 12 and eight years, managed to escape from the tormentors and sought help of police. Cops suspect that the two were about to be trafficked. Raids are on to nab the accused.

---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Devotees give Ganesh a green farewell||LUCKNOW: Bidding farewell to Lord Ganesh in a colourful way, several puja samitis performed the eco-friendly immersions on their own on the concluding day of the 10-day Ganesh Chaturthi festival on Sunday. However, as Lucknow Municipal Corporation did not make arrangements for land immersion on Gomti banks despite several assurances, many devotees continued to throng Jhulelal Ghat to immerse idols directly into the river. “To check river pollution, on the direction of the high court, the practice of land immersions on artificial ponds created by the LMC on the river bank had started in 2019 but this year the civic body had not made adequate arrangements, which is also a violation of court’s order,” said Rakshita Sinha, a devotee. “Last year, despite Covid restrictions, pits were dug by the LMC and personnel were deployed to clean them regularly, but this year there was only one pit and that too filled with trash with no cleaning staff around,” said Sanjay Singh, another devotee. However, keeping in mind the environment and water conservation, the members of Oscar Yog Sai Sewa Samiti set an example by performing land immersion at Jhulelal ghat by cleaning the pit themselves before performing the rituals. “Our idol was an eco-friendly one, made of clay, cow dung, hay, which gradually will turn into manure after immersion in the land,” said Ganesh Pawar, organiser of the festival at Shivaji Marg, adding that no worker of LMC was present at the ghat. Shri Shubh Sanskar Samiti, organiser of Chowk’s ‘Chaupatiyon ke Raja’ also performed an eco-friendly immersion at Bada Shivala Mandir. “Due to increasing water pollution, we immersed our idol in a small bucket at the temple itself,” said organiser Riddhi Gaur. Ganesh Prakatya Committee of the famous ‘Manautiyon ke Raja’ performed immersion on the same lines on Saturday. “We sent out a message of water conservation,” said organiser Bharat Bhushan Gupta. Senior LMC officers were not available for comments, while others said that a private agency was told to make the arrangements. They said that the matter will be probed and adequate arrangements will be made for Durga Puja.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/devotees-give-ganesh-a-green-farewell/articleshow/86354415.cms||Aditi Singh

Earlier, only 50 invitees were allowed. However, relaxation will apply only to areas outside containment zones. Coming ahead of the wedding season over next couple of months, the development spells a breather for households seeking a reasonably large gathering at their private functions. While giving its nod to 100 invitees, the state home department sought strict adherence to Covid-19 protocols, including wearing of masks, 2-yard social distancing, setting up of Covid helpdesks at venues, sanitization of premises and clean toilets. The move comes 12 days after partial lockdown regulations were further relaxed and economic activity was allowed between 6 am-11 pm throughout the week. Earlier, the government relaxed night curfew by an hour and allowed shops, malls, and restaurants to remain open till 10 pm. Last month, weekend lockdowns were lifted, allowing activity on Saturdays and Sundays as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/covid-graph-flattened-up-allows-gathering-of-100-at-weddings/articleshow/86354423.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Fighting odds, Lucknow University’s BA entrance topper sets eyes on IAS dream||LUCKNOW: Aditya was two-year-old when he was diagnosed with 40% locomotive disorder caused due to high fever. Being financially weak, his family resigned to fate as it could not afford treatment in a big hospital. As the boy from a small village in Fatehpur district grew up, he developed aspiration to become an IAS officer and started working hard against odds to excel in studies. The 17-year-old moved a step closer towards realising his dream when he topped the Lucknow University’s entrance examination for admission to BA course. “I will opt for political science, history and English as a subject combination in BA and start preparation for civil services simultaneously,” said Aditiya, after securing first rank among 10,000 candidates in LU entrance test. Aditya’s source of inspiration is his elder sister Aishwarya who, while pursuing her own education, took tuitions to ensure that he went to a private school where the fees was Rs 1,500 monthly, the amount which their father, Sanjeev Mishra, a small shopkeeper in Jafarganj village, could not afford. Aditya studied 14 hours a day to overcome challenges. “When Aditya was two years old, his grandfather noticed that his left hand and leg was not functioning normally. Doctors diagnosed locomotive disorder – a disability caused by weakness in bones, joints and muscles. They recommended physiotherapy and treatment, but since our resources were limited, we could not do much for him,” said Aditya’s mother, Neerja Mishra. “Since Aditya cannot use both hands at a time, his speed in daily work is slow, which he overcame by devoting more time in studies and always scored high marks at the school level. Seeing his dedication, Aishwarya got him enrolled in a private school after Class 8. She is now a science graduate and preparing for BEd,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/fighting-odds-lus-ba-entrancetopper-sets-eyes-on-ias-dream/articleshow/86354421.cms||---
---||Trichy||10 years on, wards added to Trichy corporation cry for better roads, infra development||TRICHY: Ten years after five wards in Thiruverumbur were added to Trichy corporation, residents are still awaiting the promised development of infrastructure while merging with the urban local body. Residents say that even during a moderate rain, roads in the added areas go swampy and offer a backbreaking journey. Indeed, waste collection has improved and there was a surge in land value, but nothing else has changed for them, the residents in the added wards say. Trichy corporation had previously witnessed an expansion in 2011. With the amalgamation of Thiruverumbur town panchayat and four village panchayats, namely Ellakudi, Alathur, Keelakalkandarkottai and Pappakurichi, five more wards (number 61 to 65) were added to the urban local body. With another round of expansion on cards with the addition of 25 village panchayats, residents of the added wards say they are yet to get their due. Localities comprising Amman Nagar, New town, Balaji Nagar and Kattur were the most to suffer as the residential roads dug up for underground drainage work were too difficult to commute. Though underground drainage and drinking water projects are under way, residents said the projects could have been initiated and completed much before in the past decade. “Even the ongoing UGD work is too slow, cars and heavy vehicles are getting stuck during rain,” K Shyam Sundar, a resident of New town said. While the other corporation wards have several public parks in close proximity, the added wards are deprived of proper green space. While solid waste management has improved for the better, the land value after the upgradation to corporation has increased too as commercial establishments have cropped up in Thiruverumbur. Drinking water supply is erratic in wards 65 and 63, forcing residents to rely on purified RO water. Poor infrastructure growth of the added wards has prompted the recently chosen panchayats to oppose the plan. “We will complete the UGD work by 2022. The added wards will get new roads as a part of Rs 40 crore road development work. The wards would not have got UGD if they were town or village panchayat,” a senior official with Trichy corporation said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/10-years-on-wards-added-to-trichy-corpn-cry-for-better-roads-infra-development/articleshow/86352788.cms||Deepak Karthik

Irked over the delay, they started accessing the bridge, where construction materials has been haphazardly kept. Residents said that with the RoB closed, they are forced to take 3-5 km detours via congested Karur bypass road and Thennur RoB to reach localities like Singarathope, Teppakulam, Chathiram bus stand and College road. While the corporation was considering reopening the RoB after completing the maintenance work by the end of September, few people started using the bridge from Saturday night. The barricades placed on either end of the RoB were removed and both two-wheelers and auto rickshaws were seen plying on the road. Corporation officials said that 90% of the maintenance work has been completed and added that curing process is underway to strengthen the new reinforced cement concrete (RCC) retaining wall. As the surface of the RoB was not levelled yet, officials said that two-wheeler riders are vulnerable to a fatal fall as iron rods were placed over the road. “Within 10 days we will complete the work including laying a fresh layer of the bituminous road,” an official with the corporation said. “The corporation must expedite the work and till then, the bridge should remain closed. The movement of vehicles may also affect the work progress. Traffic police must intervene,” P Aiyarappan, a road safety activist said. Heavy rainfall in the city in June last year had washed away a portion of the RoB, following which it was closed for maintenance work at a cost of Rs 3 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/irked-over-delay-trichy-residents-begin-using-rob-shut-for-maintenance-works/articleshow/86352772.cms||Deepak Karthik

The minister said that the road, running along the Kudamurutti river, will be strengthened to link commercial hubs with Chathiram bus terminus. Inspecting the mass vaccination drive at KAPV school in Thillai Nagar on Sunday, Nehru said that the state highways department has initiated a slew of measures to decongest the city. Apart from the two elevated corridors proposed near the head post office and Kalaignar Arivalayam on Karur road, he said efforts are on to widen Uyyakondan aqueduct road. “We are planning to widen the stretch from the district court and along the Uyyakondan canal to 60 feet road to serve as an alternative to the choked Vayalur road. A clearance from the pollution control board is awaited,” Nehru said. Similarly, as an alternative to the congested Karur bypass road, the minister said that Konakkarai road will be redeveloped. Once refurbished, Konakkarai road can opted to proceed to Karur and western districts instead of accessing Karur bypass road. He said that preparation of a detailed project report is underway for the elevated corridor proposals near Melachinthamani and the head post office. Reacting to question on the upcoming rural local body election in the nine districts, the minister said that the DMK’s coalition remains intact and unchanged. “We are together, we will face the election as a team.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/trichys-konakkarai-road-to-be-redeveloped/articleshow/86352817.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Opposition suffering from ‘Yogi phobia’, unable to see development, says BJP||LUCKNOW: Hitting out at the SP and the BSP for alleging that no development work was carried out by the Yogi Adityanath government in the last four-and-a-half years, the BJP on Sunday said the opposition was suffering from ‘Yogi phobia’. UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh said the condition of SP, BSP and Congress was like an ostrich which had buried its head in the sand and was unable to see the all-round development of the state. “The opposition parties have lost political ground in UP. Their dream of returning to power is shattered. They are now misleading people with baseless propaganda,” he said. Training guns at the SP leadership, Singh called it the “messiah of criminals”. “SP has lost the right to speak against the government. The party is upset only because CM Yogi Adityanath has launched a campaign against mafia raaj,” he said. The UP BJP president said the SP was not worried about the poor, deprived, farmers, youth and women. “It only patronizes mafia whose illegally occupied land was facing the wrath of government bulldozers,” he said, stressing that the people of Uttar Pradesh had rejected the SP not once but twice. Attacking Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi, Singh said those coming to the state for “political tourism” should not forget that the people of UP had rejected them three decades ago. “Those who could not save their home are making frivolous statements out of desperation,” Singh said, adding that in doing so, the opposition leaders were only losing their own dignity. “With the blessings of the people, BJP will come back with a huge majority,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/oppn-suffering-from-yogi-phobiaunable-to-see-states-devpt-bjp/articleshow/86354428.cms||---

The state government has planned to consider Silambam in employment reservation and the Union ministry of youth affairs and sports recently included Silambam under the promotion of inclusiveness through sports initiative as a part of the ‘Khelo India’ programme. “Such recognitions and assurance in reservation in jobs and education will encourage more youngsters, particularly, from rural parts to take up Silambam. Rallying on such support from the governments, we have planned to promote the art further in the international arena,” R Mohan, vice-president of the world Silambam youth federation said on Sunday in Trichy. A new association named Tamil Nadu Silambam Korvai Association was formed in Trichy with Dr V Jayapal as the president and M Sundaresan, physical director of KAPV school as the secretary. The association has planned to conduct a state-level Silambam competition for all age groups in Trichy in December.

---||Lucknow||CM Yogi Adityanath invokes Suheldev, Nishad Raj at OBC morcha meet in Ayodhya||LUCKNOW: CM Yogi Adityanath on Sunday said that the various castes within the OBC bloc were not separate and had one key identity of being "fighters of Hindu Society". Speaking at the concluding day of the working committee of UP BJP OBC Morcha organised in Ayodhya, Yogi said that division of a community into sub-caste and groups have always led to their disintegration. Yogi's statement attained much political significance amid BJP concerted bid to consolidate the OBC community which accounts for 42% of the voting population. The saffron party's bid to cement different OBC groups was also seen as a major step to take on a belligerent opposition, especially the Samajwadi Party which has been harping on coming together of Muslims and Yadavs. Yogi categorically invoked 11th century king Suheldev -- considered an iconic figure for ‘most backward’ Rajbhars -- who defeated Ghaznavid general Ghazi Miyan at Bahraich in 1034. He said Suheldev played a key role in saving Indian religion, culture and tradition from the onslaught of foreign invaders. Yogi's stance vis-a-vis Suheldev comes amid BJP consistent outreach to the Rajbhar community which accounts for a sizable voting population, mainly in the east UP region. This was also seen as Yogi's counter to former BJP ally and SBSP chief Om Prakash Rajbhar who has been unleashing salvos at the BJP accusing it of ditching the backward castes. He also called upon the OBC community to remember King Nishad Raj in whose name a memorial is being constructed by the BJP government in Shringverpur near Prayagraj. Nishad Raj is said to have helped Ram, Sita and Laxman cross the Ganga when they were on their way to forest to spend 14 years in exile. "Why have people forgotten his historical importance," Yogi asked, asserting that after coming to power, his government decided to celebrate Diwali in Ayodhya to bring back its glory. "Now, it is the identity of Ayodhya," he said, adding that the festival also brought benefits to the Prajapati (potter) community, an OBC. At the same time, Yogi did not miss the chance to slam the opposition, accusing it of doing politics in the name of backwards and doing nothing for the community. The CM said that it's the BJP government at the Centre which formed the OBC commission and made it constitutional authority -- a long pending demand of the backward community. "This could have been done before. But the previous government was busy dividing the community," he said. In a veiled attack on the Samajwadi Party, Yogi said that "few people" challenged Ram Bhakts saying that "not even a bird can enter Ayodhya". "The same people are now chanting Ram's name," he said, asserting that the faces of these politicians need to be identified. Yogi also said some historians with leftist mindset "mischievously" tried to categorize national heroes like Rana Pratap, Chhatrapati Shivaji, Rani Laxmi Bai and Uda Devi, into different castes which led to division of society, eventually weakening it. He said that our national heroes fought foreign invaders for the sake of the country and the religion. "The invaders divided various communities into various sub-castes leading to their denigration," he said. "Instead of Maharan Rana Pratap, Akbar was titled as `Great'...," Yogi said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/yogi-invokes-suheldev-nishad-rajat-obc-morcha-meet-in-ayodhya/articleshow/86354430.cms||Pankaj Shah

The new state-of-the-art equipment at the cyber cell of Lucknow Police will now enable the cops to nail and nab the accused in much less time from earlier, when it used to be over 10 days. Besides, there will be more features and tools to crack cybercrime cases. Cyber cell ACP Vivek Ranjan Rai said the new tools will improve investigation and help nab criminals. “In cases of morphed photos, videos we had to be dependent on the policies of social media sites which took several days. But now, the ‘amped software’ will help us enhance morphed videos, photos and even blur images within minutes and trace the sources,” the ACP said. The cyber cell will now use forensic tools to extract mobile data erased from phones and hard disk forensic tools for extracting deleted data from laptops and computers, he added. “We will soon also be able to crack passwords of any desktop or mobile phone using new software,” the ACP said. A proposal has been sent for purchase of ‘chip off technology’ used to extract data of any type from a broken phone, laptop or computer. The new cybercell will now also maintain records and complaints digitally, replacing the manual register. The cyber cell is also launching an awareness drive on cyber frauds. “We will play audios of 50-55 seconds at bus stops, railway stations, Metro stations and create awareness regarding not revealing OTPs, passwords of credit cards, debit cards on call to criminals who call posing as bankers,” said Rai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/hi-tech-tools-to-help-cops-nab-cyber-crooks-crack-cases/articleshow/86354433.cms||---

According to police, the woman was identified as R Vijayalakhsmi, 30, a native of Kandharvakottai in Pudukottai district. As her husband Rangeswaran passed away sometime back, she moved to Thanjavur with her daughter R Vidya and four-year-old son, R Vignesh.

---||Lucknow||Jaunpur custodial death: CBI lodges murder FIR against police special operations group||LUCKNOW: Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in Lucknow lodged a case of murder and robbery on Sunday against Special Operations Group (SOG) of Jaunpur police after a custodial death on February 12 drew a sharp reprimand from Allahabad high court last month. After the body of the victim, Krishna Kumar Yadav, 24, was handed over to his family, his brother Ajay cried murder and moved court. He told the bench that his brother, who had no criminal antecedents, was dragged into custody by Jaunpur police, robbed of Rs 60,000 and tortured to death. CBI registered a case of murder, robbery, trespass, intentional insult against the SOG team, former station officer of Baksha police station Ajay Kumar Singh and his aide. Ajay also alleged police fabricated a story that his brother succumbed to injuries after he met with an accident and was subsequently thrashed by a mob. He also claimed the autopsy was tampered. “My brother, Krishna Kumar’s buttocks were riddled with contusions. And this was ignored in the autopsy report, which cited heart attack (myocardial infraction) as cause of death,” said Ajay in his petition. Ajay also stated police committed perjury by telling a local court they did not take Krishna to the district hospital, but to a community health centre in Naupedwa, Jaunpur, on February 12. “We also have hospital records to prove that on February 12 at 1.55 am, the doctor on duty at CHC, Naupedwa, referred him to Jaunpur district hospital after his blood pressure and pulse fell dramatically. The police general diary claims Krishna was moved out of Baksha thana at 2am and taken to CHC and then to the district hospital by a sub-inspector and two constables. The SI, however, told the court Krishna was only taken to CHC, Naupedwa, which shows a mismatch between police records and court statement, the petitioner alleged. Superintendent of police, Jaunpur, Ajay Sahni, said, all accused policemen named were suspended by former superintendent of police Jaunpur, Raj Karan Nayyar, and an independent SIT under a circle officer rank officer was constituted to probe the case. The case was also transferred to CB-CID branch of UP Police for fair investigation. Police also said, non-bailable warrants have been issued against the accused. An official in CBI said, they were yet to get documents of the case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/jaunpur-custodial-death-cbi-lodges-murder-fir-against-police-special-operations-group/articleshow/86354432.cms||Pathikrit Chakraborty

The ED has received court permission for custodial interrogation of SP's Lok Sabha MP Azam Khan from September 20 to 24 in connection with a money laundering case registered against him and his son, both currently in the district jail at Sitapur. The UP government has already moved to reclaim 170 acres of Azam Khan-controlled Mohammad Ali Jauhar University in Rampur. UP police and central agencies are investigating several other land grab cases. The other alleged mafia dons associated with BSP and SP, Mukhtar Ansari and Atiq Ahmad respectively, will be questioned in prison by senior ED officials and officers investigating the case. While Ansari is lodged in the district jail at Banda, Atiq is in Sabarmati jail in Ahmedabad. ED Lucknow zone head Rajeshwar Singh confirmed that the agency has received permission from courts for custodial interrogation of these alleged dons. He didn't deny the attachment proceedings initiated against them. The agency has clubbed Azam Khan with the others and has identified their properties and various other assets to attach them in money laundering cases being investigated against them and their family members. While Azam Khan is a sitting Lok Sabha MP and a senior SP leader, Mukhtar Ansari has been five-time MLA from Mau on a BSP ticket. Atiq Ahmad too has his affiliation to SP and was elected to Lok Sabha in 2014 on an SP ticket. Mukhtar Ansari has 49 FIRs registered against him in cases related to murder, extortion and land grabbing. He also faces a case of laundering MLA local area development funds and grabbing properties of evacuees who had migrated to Pakistan. According to a dossier prepared by ED on Atiq Ahmad, he has 196 FIRs registered against him in cases of murder, extortion, land and companies grabbing. In one case, a businessman, Mohit Jaiswal, was brought to Deoria jail where Atiq Ahmad was lodged. Jaiswal was thrashed and, facing a threat to his life, transferred at least three of his companies to Atiq Ahmad's aides.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ed-to-quiz-3-dons-linked-to-sp-bsp/articleshow/86355783.cms||Pradeep Thakur

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: ‘Double-engine govt’ could not even make a start in 4.5 years, says Akhilesh Yadav||LUCKNOW: Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday said the four-and-a-half-year of BJP rule in Uttar Pradesh can be best described as the story of a government that remained stranded in the yard as the self-proclaimed double engines could never start. He said the ruling BJP remained afloat all the while only by misleading people through government advertisements. “The ruling BJP claimed that it had a double engine government but the reality is that the engines never started. The double engine government has been parked in the sick-yard and no one heard the engine throttle even once,” Akhilesh said hours after the government held a press conference to outline its achievement since it came to power. “While making tall claims and announcing projects, what the chief minister forgets is that people can easily make out that a government has failed to deliver in the past four-and-a-half-years and the last six months of the regime will be no different,” the former UP CM said. He said the 16-page booklet that the government has released to highlight ‘its achievements’ is actually full of falsehood and lies. “It seems to be more a text book of BJP’s international training institute of falsehood and lies which the party will only be able to circulate online and will not dare to distribute it among people who are angry over government apathy,” the SP chief said. “All that the BJP government has done is change names of schemes that were started by the previous Samajwadi Party government and inaugurate them. There is not a single project that the government can name of which it has laid the foundation stone and inaugurated as well,” he said. The SP chief said all that the government has done and repeatedly so is to humiliate women, Dalits and Backwards as if it was BJP’s core agenda. The government has also made a mockery of the democratic set up to attack the very spirit of the Indian Constitution. He said the people of the state are feeling cheated by the manner in which law and order went for a toss under the ruling BJP, crime against women and children, rapidly rising unemployment and anti-farmer policies have impacted all sections of the society. “Instead of politics of hate and vendetta, people of Uttar Pradesh want development, jobs for youth and welfare of the people at large. People are ready to vote the BJP out of power and form the SP government in UP in the assembly polls,” Akhilesh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/double-engine-govt-could-not-even-make-a-start-in-4-5-years-akhilesh/articleshow/86354437.cms||Pervez Siddiqui

Statistics from National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) for 2020 show that the crime graph registered a dip of around 20% as compared to the corresponding figures in 2019 in terms of crimes against minors and 18% in those against women.

The maximum reduction was witnessed in crimes related to domestic violence (cruelty by husbands and relatives) against women. According to NCRB records, 18,304 domestic violence cases were reported in 2019 which fell to 14,454 in 2020. Another crime where major decline was witnessed was kidnapping or abduction.

---||Dehradun||Nearly 1/3rd of U’khand youth unemployed: NSO survey||Nainital: As unemployment emerges as a major poll plank in Uttarakhand, the latest NSO data on jobs show that nearly one-third of the state’s urban youth is unemployed. NSO’s Periodic Labour Force Survey for the October-December 2020 quarter found that 27% of those between the ages of 15 and 29 in Uttarakhand do not have a job, higher than the national average of 25%. Unemployment in Uttarakhand peaked, along with the rest of the country, in April-June 2020 at 38%, dipped to 22% the following quarter and then rose again. It is yet to go back to the pre-pandemic 21% of October-December 2019, a 6-percentage point gap. When compared to other states, Uttarakhand had the 10th highest unemployment — with Jammu and Kashmir (44%) and Kerala (43%) reporting the highest, and Gujarat (9%) and West Bengal (17%) the lowest. There has been a consistent gender disparity in Uttarakhand, reflecting a national trend. Women’s unemployment (35%) was much higher than that of men (25%) in October-December 2020. In the previous quarter, too, women’s unemployment was 28% while that of men was 21%. It was only in April-June 2020 that the figures were close — 37% women unemployed and 38% men. The overall worker population ratio (percentage of employed working-age people) for women in October-December 2020 was just 12.5%, lower than the national 14%. For men, it was 50% in Uttarakhand and 52% nationally. The overall unemployment rate also rose over the year — from 9% on October-December 2019 to 11.6% in the same quarter of 2020. This, too, was higher than the national average of 10%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/nearly-1/3rd-of-ukhand-youth-unemployed-nso-survey/articleshow/86348741.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Lucknow||We have fulfilled all promises made in Sankalp Patra: Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: Maintaining that his government has fulfilled all the promises made in BJP’s ‘Lok Kalyan Sankalp Patra’ (election manifesto) in 2017, UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday asserted that the saffron party was poised to return to office by winning no less than 350 seats in the forthcoming UP assembly elections due next year. He was speaking at an event organised to mark the completion of four-and-a-half years of BJP government in Uttar Pradesh. Yogi’s assertion was seen as his stern rebuttal to opposition’s charge accusing the ruling BJP of failing to stand by the promises it made to the people while failing to deliver a responsive government and putting the state on a requisite growth trajectory. “Our friends in the opposition need to have the habit of reading and understanding how the promises made in the Sankalp Patra have been fulfilled and how the perception about UP has changed,” Yogi said, while speaking at length about the development projects like expressways and Metro rails and implementation of various government schemes, including PMAY, Saubhagya and Ujjwala, taken up under the incumbent BJP dispensation. The event, which was marked as `Vikas Utsav’ with a tag line of “Soch Imaandaar, Kam Damdaar...Chha Gayi Yogi Sarkaar”, also had the presence of BJP vice-president and UP in charge Radha Mohan Singh and UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh. In another rebuttal to the opposition, the CM also defended ho government with a firm assertion over management of the two waves of Corona pandemic even as many other states faced resurgence of new cases. Yogi did not miss the chance to lash out at the opposition parties for avoiding going to Hindu religious centres like Ayodhya and Mathura out of fear of getting tagged as “communal”. “But the BJP did not think so and organised events that marked the religious and cultural identity of the places,” he said. Launching a blistering attack on the previous SP government, Yogi said that this is the same UP where criminals and mafia dons enjoyed political patronage and riots happened every fourth day. “Now, no riots happen and criminals are facing the wrath of the government,” he said, highlighting his government’s achievement of seizing illegally occupied land worth nearly Rs 1,800 crore. The CM pointed out that UP is ranked No. 1 in the implementation of 44 central schemes among all states in the country. He added that the state government launched the Mission Shakti programme for the safety and empowerment of women. Yogi said 1.38 crore poor have ben provided free power connections while 2.61 crore toilets have been built in the state in the past 4.5 years. In terms of infrastructure also, UP has been making rapid progress with the construction of expressways. Besides, the state currently boasts of five international airports and eight domestic airports while work is underway on 10 airports, the CM said. He also slammed the previous CMs for vying to make big bungalows for themselves while ignoring the basic needs of the people. “But we did not make houses for self but provided houses to as many as 42 lakh people,” Yogi said, in an apparent jibe at SP chief Akhilesh Yadav and BSP chief Mayawati. He also underscored that it was the team work of the state government and the BJP organisation that the needs of the people were fulfilled. He also credited the leadership of PM Narendra Modi and other senior BJP leaders, including party president JP Nadda and home minister Amit Shah in helping the state government achieve its goals. “We managed to infuse confidence among people about governance and facilitate them on various fronts. And this is the real identity of the present government,” he said. He said that UP used to witness deaths due to hunger. “But after BJP came to power it was found that nearly 40 lakh needy people did not have the ration cards, which were otherwise used fraudulently by other people. We put a check on the practice and connected all 80,000 PDS shops with e-PoS machines,” he said. Yogi added that the state government also ensured that people get adequate compensation in times of crisis. “We transferred Rs 5 lakh crore to the needy through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) in the last four and a half year period,” he said. On the employment front, he said, youth were given jobs on the basis of merit, while following reservation provisions, and not by their “identity”. In a veiled attack on the opposition, Yogi said that earlier the “whole Khandaan” used to move out to “extort money” from the job seekers. “Now, there is no `dalaali’ and over 4.5 lakh jobs were given to the youth,” he said, insisting that even the transfer and posting of officials in the government had become an “industry” in the previous government. “But in the past 4.5 years, no one can level a charge of corruption in the transfer of officials. We have been able to provide a stable government,” he said. Yogi said that the “swift decision making” image of his government and improvement in UP’s ranking from 14th to 2nd position in “ease of doing business” attracted a host of big investors to the state. He said even the small and medium scale industries, which were dying a slow death in the previous government, were now exporting products worth over Rs 1.21 lakh crore. The CM also took a pot shot at the previous SP and BSP governments — spanning between 2007 and 2017 — accusing them of paying a paltry Rs 95,000 crore to the cane growers. “In contrast our 4.5-year rule saw cane farmers being given a compensation of over Rs 1.43 lakh crore,” he said. He also cited the example of paddy and wheat procurement which, he claimed, remained as low as 6 lakh MT per annum in the previous government. This, Yogi said, increased to 66 lakh MT annually in case of paddy and 56 lakh MT in case of wheat, despite the Corona pandemic. Yogi’s statement came amid the ongoing farm protest which threatens to take political overtones in politically restive west UP region.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/we-have-fulfilled-all-promisesmade-in-sankalp-patra-yogi/articleshow/86354463.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Nagpur||Rs17 crore of hidden income found in Deshmukh case: I-T||Nagpur: The income tax department search and seizure operation carried out on the premises of former home minister Anil Deshmukh has thrown up evidence of concealment of income to the tune of Rs17 crore. “Several bank lockers found during the course of operations have been put under prohibitory orders and the evidence gathered is being examined,” said a press release issued by the department. The release says the operation was conducted on September 17 in the case of a prominent public figure in Nagpur and his family. Official sources told news agencies this indicates the action against Deshmukh and his kin. Over 30 premises were covered in cities like Mumbai, New Delhi and Kolkata, apart from Nagpur in the action. There is evidence of unaccounted funds to the tune of Rs4 crore being routed to the trust run by Deshmukh and his group. The amount has been received as donation routed through Delhi-based companies. This clearly substantiates the laundering of unaccounted income, which was routed as donation, claims the I-T department. The department also claims to have got specific evidence which reveals that three educational institutions of the trust run by Deshmukh had been inflating expenses. The expenses were recorded as salaries paid to the staff. Part of the amount was collected back in cash. Evidence of such practices was found for several financial years, and the total amount comes to over Rs12 crore, says the release. Another Rs87 lakh has been paid to brokers in cash for arranging admissions, says the release. This makes the entire amount of concealed income as Rs17 crore, according to the income tax department’s calculations. The release says that the group has wide business interests in fields ranging from education, warehousing and agri-business in Nagpur and other parts of the state. During the course of the search and seizure operation, many incriminating documents, loose sheets and digital evidence was found and seized. This evidence clearly indicates the involvement of the group in unaccounted financial transactions made outside the regular books of accounts, including inflation of expenses, money laundering, bogus donation receipts, unaccounted cash expenses etc, the release said. After the search, an appraisal report will be made by the department and submitted to the concerned assessing officer in the central circle of the department. After a raid the jurisdiction of a case is transferred to the central circle as against the regular circle. The assessing officer of central circle will assess the tax liability after referring to the appraisal report. The persons covered in the raid also have a chance to be heard before the assessing officer, explained a chartered accountant.

---||Lucknow||Mainpuri girl’s death: New SIT visits school, recreates crime scene||Lucknow: The new special investigation team (SIT) constituted to probe into the mysterious death of a Class 11 girl at Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya, Mainpuri, in 2019, visited the school on Sunday to recreate the crime scene. The team also took the statements of school’s staff members. After being pulled up by the Allahabad high court for failing to submit a conclusive report in the case, the UP DGP had constituted a fresh SIT on September 17. DGP Mukul Goel also held a review meeting of the SIT and directed it to ensure quick and proper investigation into the case. He also asked the officials of the first SIT to brief the new team about the entire case. The new SIT led by ADG, Kanpur, Bhanu Bhaskar, and IG (ATS) GK Goswamy, Kanpur IG Mohit Agarwal, ASP Rakesh Yadav and DySP, Kanpur Dehat, Tanu Upadhyay as members, reconstructed the crime scene with the help of forensic experts. Sources privy to the investigation said the team was camping in Mainpuri and was expected to take statements of more teachers. The SIT also examined the reports of lie-detector test and DNA profiling done by the first team and the statements of students and staff. On September 16, 2019, the Class 11 girl was found hanging in the dormitory of the school. Agarwal is the only officer to be retained from the 2019 investigation team, which had failed to file a closure report, despite conducting DNA profiling of 95 suspects and lie-detector tests on 10 others. Those interrogated were the girl’s classmates, teachers and school staff. The clothes on the girl’s body had traces of semen, but the first SIT had failed to match the DNA with any of the suspects. The girl’s father had then accused the school authorities of delay in informing him about his daughter’s death. He questioned the autopsy report and accused the warden and principal of complicity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/mainpuri-girls-death-new-sit-visits-school-recreates-crime-scene/articleshow/86354485.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Experts, enthusiasts converge at Corbett to track & document butterflies||Nainital: Several experts and butterfly enthusiasts have congregated at the Corbett Tiger Reserve (CTR) to document butterfly species in the area as part of the ‘Titli Tyar’ butterfly festival which started last week in Ramnagar. According to estimates, there are around 150 butterfly species in Corbett and in the last few days, 30 of them have been documented. According to Corbett officials, the exercise involves tracking the behaviour, flight and habitat of the butterflies, so that they can be protected. The festival also aims at diversifying tourism opportunities in Corbett which are, at present, heavily focused on tigers and elephants.  “We want to establish a butterfly-centric tourism sector in Corbett. At present, a majority of the tourists come to watch tigers or elephants, which are not easy to spot. But with butterflies, it’s different. Children can study their entire life cycle and have 20-25 different species of butterflies fluttering around them without any fear,” said Imran Khan, an ecologist and one of the organisers. Corbett director Rahul (who uses only his first name) concurred. Speaking to TOI, he said the festival was a way to create awareness about butterflies in Corbett. Documentation, too, is part of the plan, he added. “We want to know more about the life cycle, flight patterns and habitats of butterflies. We have documented many species in our official records but if the volunteers here find any new species, it will help us remain up to speed,” he said. According to Shah Belal, senior wildlife biologist at Corbett, there are around 400 species of butterflies in Uttarakhand and of these, around 100 can be spotted frequently. “Pre or post-monsoon is the perfect time to witness and document butterflies,” he said. Khan, meanwhile, added that there were around 30 volunteers and experts involved in the festival and after surveying Kyari village and northern periphery of Corbett, they would move towards Pangot which is another hotspot for birds and butterflies.

He also promised Rs 5,000 per month as unemployment allowance, which an individual would continue to avail until he/she gets a job. Kejriwal, who was in Haldwani on Sunday, said the party would create 1 lakh government jobs within six months of coming to power, with 80% reservation in both government and private jobs for the local youth. Besides, the AAP chief also announced a new ministry of employment and migration if the party was voted to power in the hill state. Taking a dig at the BJP which had changed its CM twice in the past few months, Kejriwal said that his party will ensure that the CM they give to the state stays the full term. "The AAP government will also set up a job portal on the lines of Delhi for the youth of the state. The portal will act as an interface between employers and job seekers," he said. Earlier, on his first visit to the state in July, the AAP chief had announced 300 units of free electricity for each household if voted to power. Subsequently, during his visit in August, he declared retired Colonel Ajay Kothiyal as the party’s CM face. Sunday was the first time Kejriwal was in the Kumaon region as his previous two visits had been to Dehradun. The Aam Aadmi Party also took out a “Tiranga Sankalp Yatra” in Haldwani during the day which was attended by scores of the party's supporters in the region.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/arvind-kejriwal-vows-jobs-rs-5000-every-month-to-uttarakhand-unemployed/articleshow/86348843.cms||Gaurav Talwar

The agencies were divided into two categories — those which received more than 100 complaints through the “Green Delhi” application and those with over 1,000 complaints. A review of their performance till August was conducted. The performance has been adjudged on three parameters — quantity of complaint resolution, quality and timeliness, officials said. “Quality” of complaint resolution means whether the complaint was resolved properly or was it reopened. Not a single department could resolve their complaints within the cumulative stipulated time, according to government data. Five departments received more than 1,000 complaints — the three municipal corporations, public works department, and Delhi Development Authority. The east corporation was ranked first in this category with a net score of 58 (out of 100). It resolved 3,423 of the 3,436 complaints received as 90% of the resolved complaints were never reopened. PWD resolved 4,630 of the 4,771 complaints and stood second with 56 points, while SDMC disposed of 5,622 of the 5,877 complaints bagging the third place. The north civic body readdressed 5,527 of the 6,040 cases and DDA 1,300 of the 1,536 cases. In the 100 plus category, New Delhi Municipal Council resolved 216 of the 218 complaints received and scored 62 points, grabbing the top spot. Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, which stood second in this category with 58 points, settled 164 of the 166 complaints.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/edmc-tops-govt-ranking-of-depts-for-complaint-resolution/articleshow/86353142.cms||---

The activists accused a local priest of misguiding and converting a man’s wife and daughters to Christianity. Chakeri police rushed to the spot and took the priest into custody and started investigation. In the meanwhile, a group of people belonging to the Christian community also reached the police station on getting information about the incident and accused police of partisan approach. They also accused the cops of misbehaving with the priest. Gulab Verma, a resident of Kazi Khera of Lal Bangla, alleged that a few months ago, a Christian priest and his associates had forced his wife and his two daughters to convert to Christianity in lieu of monetary and other benefits. “Now my wife is pressuring me too to convert at the behest of these people. As a result, disputes often arise in the family,” he said. On finding no solution, he informed the local activists about the conversions in his family and sought their help. The activists reached the spot and created a ruckus on Sunday. The police rushed to the spot on receiving information about some ruckus. They took the priest into custody and brought him to the police station. Later, a group of people belonging to the Christian community too arrived at the police station. They said the allegations of forced conversions against the priest were false. At the same time, some local activists entered the priest’s house and accused the police of being biased. Inspector Chakeri police station Madhur Mishra said both the parties were brought to the police station for questioning. “Further action will be taken after due investigation,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/local-activists-create-ruckus-alleging-conversion-of-woman-daughter-to-christianity/articleshow/86350843.cms||---
---||Delhi||J&K ex-MLC Trilochan Singh Wazir murder: Delhi Police arrest prime accused||NEW DELHI: Harmeet Singh (61), the prime accused in the high-profile murder of former member of the J&K Legislative Council and National Conference functionary Trilochan Singh Wazir has been arrested by Special Cell of Delhi Police. DCP Sanjeev Kumar Yadav said the suspect had fled to Jammu and was arrested after a week-long chase. “A pistol and a live round was seized from him. A handwritten suicide note, whose image was posted by him on his Facebook page to mislead police, has also been seized, along with the ballpoint pen used to write it,” he added. On September 12, TOI had reported that a man named Harmeet Singh had shot dead Wazir and was the prime suspect. Wazir had come to Delhi on September 2 as he had a flight to Canada the next day. On September 9, his decomposed body was found in a flat on the second floor of a building in W-Block, Basai Darapur, Moti Nagar. The flat was taken on rent six months ago by Harpreet Singh. He was found missing along with his friend Harmeet and they became the prime suspects. They were found to have gone to Jammu. “A team comprising ACP Jasbir Singh and inspectors Bhagwati and Puran Pant went to Jammu to catch them. On September 19, the team received information that Harmeet would meet someone near Jammu border in search of a new hideout and he was arrested,” said Yadav. During interrogation, Harmeet, a property dealer, disclosed that a rivalry started between him and Wazir three years ago. Severe differences had arisen between members of a gurdwara and him and Wazir regarding a calendar that was to be launched with the photograph of Guru Nanak. On August 22, Harmeet came to Delhi to fulfill formalities for a Canadian visa for his son and stayed with Harpreet, who assured to get his work done. On August 31, Harpreet talked with Wazir on the phone in Harmeet’s presence. After that, Harpreet asked him to shift to a hotel as Wazir was coming to Delhi. Harmeet relocated to a nearby hotel in the wake of his differences with Wazir. “On September 3, Harpreet came to Harmeet’s hotel room claiming that Wazir had planned to eliminate his son and had already dispatched shooters from Punjab and Haryana to Jammu for the job,” Yadav said. Harpreet allegedly instigated Harmeet to kill Wazir and save his family. Harmeet shot Wazir in his sleep. After the murder, they fled to Jammu. Raids are on to nab Harpreet.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/prime-accused-in-jk-ex-mlc-murder-held/articleshow/86353152.cms||---

The project to draw bulk water from the supply line for industrial use is yet to be implemented, and this is delaying launch of the 450-bed hospital built at a cost of Rs 160 crore. CIMS is using the district hospital as a teaching hospital as the five-storey structure is yet to be opened for patients. At present, the hospital is using borewell water to meet its needs. But it would be insufficient after the hospital is inaugurated and opened for public use. The building is also short of security staff. The new facility has come up on 31,000sqm land spread over 2.3acres of the 10acre land sanctioned by the government at Yedapura campus. The works, which began in early 2018, was built in about four years. As the new hospital has seven entry and exit points, CIMS has initiated the process for recruitment of security staff.  Guarding the 10acre campus is vital, as also managing the movement of patients, their attendants, vehicles, hospital staff and others. Construction of restrooms for security guards is also pending before the authorities. The five-storey building has facilities like out-patient services, wards, laboratories, emergency wards, main operation theatre, medical officers’ chambers, teaching hall, administrative services and other rooms. Once the hospital opens, it will have 750 beds. “CIMS authorities and the district administration have made all plans to get the newly constructed hospital inaugurated by the President. But the pending water and power supply connections, construction of restrooms for security guards, delay in appointment of security staff among may further delay the inauguration. CIMS authorities have written to the government informing about its requirements,” CIMS dean and director Dr Sanjiv told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/new-facility-at-cims-awaiting-water-connection/articleshow/86349447.cms||---
---||Delhi||Remote learning: Arunachal to Andamans, 22 DU colleges helping mentor institutes||NEW DELHI: Visits by teachers, online training, skill development training and student exchange programmes, this is how 22 Delhi University colleges and departments are taking forward the process of mentoring 29 colleges across the country as part of the Vidya Vistar scheme launched by DU earlier this year. Most DU colleges have picked up institutions located in rural and tribal areas, many being in the Northeast. For instance, Hansraj College has adopted three colleges, one each in Arunachal Pradesh, Ladakh and Chamba in Himachal Pradesh. Explaining the reason behind choosing these colleges, Rama Sharma, principal of Hansraj College, said, “We chose a college in the Northeast because we have alumni like Kiren Rijiju. We were already running a scheme called Vidya Setu where we had adopted many colleges. Once the university launched this scheme, we changed that to Gyan Setu.” The online teachers’ training programme has already been started. “We recently held an event where our students interacted with those of other colleges. Once the Covid-19 situation gets better, we have plans of holding exchange programmes for students of these colleges so that they get to see and access our facilities,” said Sharma. Ramanujan College has two colleges under it — Indira Gandhi National Tribal University, Imphal, and Kalimpong College, University of North Bengal. Visits by teachers have already taken place. “Two of our teachers visited both the colleges to understand how we could help them. Online teachers’ training is also being conducted. As part of the plan, teachers' exchange programme, student training programme and some extension activities will be conducted,” said SP Agarwal, principal of Ramanujan College. As part of the training programme, students would be provided skills courses such as data analytics, data mining, among others. Ramanujan College wants to work with its partners to develop the nearby areas. It would also be sharing library resources and other academic facilities with them. Mamta Sharma of Aditi Mahavidyalaya, which is partnering with a government college in Barwani, Madhya Pradesh, said, “The teachers and researchers of both colleges will be engaging in joint research activities and will be co-investigators in the programmes submitted to funding agencies. We will initiate and assist innovation activities and boost start-ups. The idea is to cultivate the feeling of brotherhood among youths of the two institutes through sports and extracurricular activities.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/remote-learning-arunachal-to-andamans-22-du-colleges-helping-mentor-institutes/articleshow/86353182.cms||Shradha Chettri

Histopathological examination revealed that it was Wilms tumour. The patient came to know of the rapidly increasing abdominal mass only after she suffered a miscarriage. She had amenorrhoea, a condition in which women face absence of menstrual periods. “After her pregnancy test came positive, the woman was told that she had multiple pregnancies. But even after her miscarriage, the lump persisted. She consulted multiple clinics and hospitals and was in distress due to the pain and pressure caused by the massive lump,” said Dr Dipayan Nandy, onco surgeon at Parul Sevashram Hospital (PSH). The CT scan and MRI at PSH revealed the presence of the huge mass in the left lumbar region involving the left kidney and adrenal gland. “The challenge was to remove the mass without damaging critical organs like pancreas, spleen, left colon, stomach, duodeno-jejunal flexure, aorta and the left diaphragm,” said Dr Nandy. “Although Wilms tumour is a type of childhood cancer that starts in the kidneys, in very rare cases it is also found in adults,” said Nandy, adding that less than 1% of all renal tumours in adults are Wilms tumour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/6kg-renal-tumour-removed-from-woman/articleshow/86349801.cms||---

Engineering wing authorities started patchworks on the damaged portion of Eluru road from Ramavarappadu Ring to Apsara Center. Condition of city roads became pathetic with heavy rains in the last two months. Roads turned into death traps with one foot deep potholes. Portion of road from Padavalarevu Junction to SRR College got damaged badly and many minor mishaps happened at this spot. The VMC initially requested the R & B department to repair the damaged roads as they are responsible for the repairs of major roads. But there was no response from the R&B authorities. Meanwhile, the public expressed anger over the bad condition of the roads. TOI had the other day highlighted the bad condition of Eluru, and KT roads in city. However, the VMC authorities have swung into action finally and started road repair works using the general fund. “We waited for the R&B to repair the roads. But the condition of Eluru road is bad and motorists are having a tough time. We waited for the rains to stop and now our engineering wing authorities are completely focusing on the road repair works. We will ensure that each and every road is repaired soon,” VMC commissioner Prasanna Venkatesh told TOI. On the bad condition of Moghalrajpuram road, Prasanna Venkatesh said high tension underground cable works have been completed and they will start the black top work next week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/vmc-wakes-up-to-bad-roads-begins-repairs/articleshow/86350923.cms||Venu Lanka
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Illegal buildings overrun green zones under GO 111 due to lax enforcement||HYDERABAD: Illegal buildings have mushroomed in Hyderabad metropolitan region, especially areas covered by GO 111, as the state failed to empower its own departments to enforce the rule of law. With mechanism to check or remove illegal structures tied in red tape, encroachers have had a field day for over a decade now. There is just one enforcement wing with 53 personnel for Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) which is spread over 7,200 sq km comprising seven districts, 70 mandals and 1,032 villages. The 53 personnel includes a DYSP, a inspector, a SI and 50 home guards. While the GO 111 itself covers 84 villages, including some gram panchayats and municipalities, which do not have any enforcement/demolition squads. The last major special drive by HMDA against illegal structures was in April, 2019. Pointing out that gram panchayats and municipalities have done little to stop illegal structures, HMDA enforcement wing officials said they could hardly take up any action on their own. “Even for demolition, machinery such as JCBs have to be provided by either the planning or engineering wing. To be effective, HMDA requires at least four enforcement wings for each zone — Medchal, Shamshabad, Shankerpally and Ghatkesar. Of these, most GO 111 areas are under Shamshabad and Shankerpally where thousands of illegal structures have come up,” a senior HMDA official told TOI. Environmentalists and activists blamed municipal administration and Ranga Reddy district administration for only filing reports, but doing little to stop violation of GO 111. According to activists, nearly 20 years ago the Hyderabad Airport Development Authority (HADA), which was part of then Hyderabad Urban Development Authority (now HMDA), had identified 128 structures including 70 in the bio-conservation zone (GO 111).  Later, on November 3, 2007, the Ranga Reddy administration submitted a report to the high court on 2,465 illegal structures in catchment areas of Himayatsagar and Osmansagar (GO 111). Apart from them, 34 institutions and 261 illegal layouts were also identified. “Unauthorised structures have come up in Shamshabad and Moinabad. While some had ground+1 permission, they raised multi-storied buildings including hotels and colleges,” said Forum For A Sustainable Environment convenor S Jeevananda Reddy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/illegal-buildings-overrun-green-zones-under-go-111-due-to-lax-enforcement/articleshow/86353179.cms||Koride Mahesh

Varanasi Police is also in touch with their counterparts in Tripura for the arrest of the girl Heena Biswas for whom an impersonator Juli Kumari was appearing in NEET on September 12 and was arrested along with her mother Babita. Two more members of the gang were arrested on Saturday increasing the number of arrests to six. Varanasi police commissioner A Satish Ganesh said on Sunday, “The kingpin of the solvers’ gang is one Neelesh Kumar, also known as Prem Kumar alias PK by his gang. Neelesh hails from Chhapra, Bihar, but lives in a luxurious house in Patna and he is fond of owning precious cars. His neighbours in the colony know that he is a doctor. We traced him and our team raided his residence, but he managed to escape with his family.” Meanwhile, the cops arrested two more gang members, Vikas Kumar Mahto of Khagadia and Raju Kumar of Jahanabad on Saturday evening with documents, Aadhaar and admit cards of many aspirants, two mobile phones and a laptop. Vikas said he met Neelesh three years ago when the latter assured him that he could get him a government job with the help of an impersonator. Vikas later started working for Neelesh. Vikas revealed the gang used to get contracts for arranging solvers through aides in Lucknow, Bengaluru, Tripura, Bihar and other states. Vikas told police that the aspirants used to deposit money in the bank account of Neelesh’s father and other members. The gang also kept the original certificates of the aspirants before taking the contract. Each solver was paid Rs five lakh for appearing in the exam, he said. The gang charged Rs 25 lakh to Rs 30 lakh from the aspirants if they got admission. The other accused Raju owns a photo studio and joined the gang through Vikas in 2019. He was paid Rs 2,000 for mixing the photographs of each aspirant and impersonator. The two accused have divulged names of many other gang members and teams have been formed for their arrest, the police commissioner said. On September 12, crime branch cops had raided NEET exam centre at St Francis Xavier School at Sona Talab in Sarnath police station area and had caught Juli and her mother Babita Devi of Patna, while Vikas had managed to escape. An FIR was lodged under Sections 419, 420, 467, 468, 471 and 34 of IPC against them.

---||Delhi||Delhi: BJP expels 3 councillors for 6 years over ‘corruption’||NEW DELHI: Ahead of the 2022 municipal polls, Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta on Sunday expelled three councillors from the party for six years over complaints of corruption and alleged indifference towards party workers. Gupta said BJP had zero tolerance for corruption. While BJP is vying for a fourth consecutive term, Aam Aadmi Party is riding the anti-corruption plank in a bid to dethrone the saffron party. The councillors expelled are Pooja Madan from Mukherjee Nagar (north corporation), Rajni Bablu Pandey from New Ashok Nagar (east corporation) and Sanjay Thakur from Saidulajaib (south corporation). The expulsions are applicable with immediate effect. Gupta said the party couldn’t ignore the complaints of corruption and this kind of action could be taken in the future as well if the need arose. He said the councillors were asked to improve their behaviour towards party workers, but nothing changed on ground. To top it all, there were now complaints of corruption against them from the public, he said. “All councillors should do public service with sincerity and honesty. If there is any laxity on this account or any corruption is detected, strict action will be taken,” Gupta warned. Meanwhile, AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj said the party had flagged the issue of BJP councillors “looting people” in April itself. He claimed that now that BJP was afraid of losing the municipal polls, it was trying a cover-up. “We have given evidence of corruption against over two dozen councillors. During the 2017 municipal polls, BJP councillors were so notorious for corrupt practices that the party had to replace all sitting councillors and come up with a new list. Expulsion from the party for corruption is not proper action, but getting them investigated by CBI or ACB is,” Bharadwaj said. He claimed that BJP knew that it was going to lose badly in the upcoming municipal elections and, therefore, it was taking cosmetic action to gain public sympathy. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor hit back, saying: “BJP would certainly have taken further action against the councillors against whom complaints of corruption were reported, but AAP has welcomed an expelled BJP councillor without inquiry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bjp-expels-3-councillors-for-6-years-over-corruption/articleshow/86353254.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Delhi||Some closure as forensics identify 5 bodies 3 months after godown blaze in Delhi||NEW DELHI: The charred remains of bodies recovered from a shoe godown in Udyog Nagar near Peeragarhi, where a major fire had broken out in the last week of June, belonged to five labourers who were initially said to be missing, a report by the forensics laboratory has stated. It took police, fire department and the disaster management team, along with forensics officials, around 10 days to recover the remains as the structure was unstable and goods were stacked close together. Several body parts were recovered from different areas. In some cases, the body was so badly burnt that it couldn’t be identified as human remains. Analysis of DNA samples revealed that the bodies belonged to five labourers identified as Neeraj (21), Ajay Shukla (22), Abhishek (19), Vikram and Sonu (22), who were brothers. The sixth exhibit was stated to be of Shamshed (19). It would be sent for re-examination as the result was unclear. When TOI spoke to the families of the deceased, they stated that they had finally got closure and could cremate them after a wait of around three months. Rajesh, Neeraj’s younger brother, said their family members had several thoughts running in their mind. “He was the eldest of three brothers and we always looked up to him. On the day of the incident, we initially thought he could be stuck. Later, when the firefighting started, we thought he had escaped. At one point, we also believed that the owner must have kidnapped him or it could be a conspiracy,” he added. “We were told the results would come in 15 days. When it finally came and we were handed over the body parts, we realised that it was Neeraj. We finally cremated him last week,” said Rajesh. Akhil, the oldest brother of Sonu and Vikram, was sure that his brothers got stuck in the fire and passed away. “When the fire occurred, they had called to say it was dark and smoke was all around. They were trying to escape. So, we knew that they were trapped. Initially, we also thought they had escaped, but as the days passed, our feelings got stronger that they had perished. The DNA analysis took long, but we were waiting for it since the last rites were yet to be done,” he added. For Abhishek’s family, the three-month journey was not an easy ride. His uncle, Nand Kishore, told TOI that the youth had called up his family saying he was stuck and had no way to escape. “All the doors were locked. The owner was allegedly inside and had removed some cartons. The staircase was so small that only one person could pass through it, but it was also completely stacked with goods. Abhishek was preparing for his Class XII exams. His younger brother is handicapped. We hope some help is provided to the family,” added Kishore. The fire had broken out on June 21. The building, consisting of a basement, ground and two other floors, did not have a valid fire NOC. The municipal corporation had declared the building dangerous after portions of the second and first floor flooring had collapsed. The owner of the building and his wife were later arrested. While the owner continues to remain in jail, his wife has been released on bail. A chargesheet will be filed in the coming week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/some-closure-as-forensics-identify-5-bodies-3-months-after-godown-blaze/articleshow/86353253.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Patuli citizens’ group’s Puja gift for needy women||Kolkata: An initiative called ‘One New Cotton Saree’ will provide new sarees to women from families of unorganised workers in and around Patuli before Durga Puja. Many of these women live in slums and work as domestic helps, while the men are mostly daily wage labourers, rickshaw pullers and masons, who have all been hit hard by the pandemic. The drive was launched by Humans of Patuli, a citizens’ group that works for communal harmony and had campaigned extensively against the new citizenship laws. The initiative has gained attention on social media and the response has been encouraging, the organisers said. “The initiative was started last year and we were able to provide 970 sarees to the women before Pujas. This year we have already collected 350 sarees and our target is to collect 1,500 so that we can give these as gifts to the underprivileged women,” said Kasturi Basu, one of the coordinators of the initiative. She added that it is the women who sacrificed the most during the economic hardship. “Therefore, we are trying to provide them with a saree as a gift during the festive season,” she said. Ultadanga resident Tumpa Mondal will donate 100 sarees to the women from families of unorganised workers. Last year, she donated around 180 sarees. “In our society, women are often the most deprived. Women from unorganised sectors earn to provide for their families and often neglect their own needs. This initiative thinks about these women who are mainly domestic workers. It has helped me stand by these women in this time of crisis,” said Mondal. Barundeb Mukherjee, a retired scientist, has also sarees for the initiative. “It is a gesture through which I want to convey that we are backing our neighbours in their struggle during this economic hardship,” the Patuli resident said. There are also plans to gift new dresses to the kids and new T-shirts to the men in these families. The organisers have urged other citizens to come forward to help them spread happiness during the festive season. This year, September 30 is the last date for donat-ing new cotton sarees for the initiative.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/patuli-citizens-groups-puja-gift-for-needy-women/articleshow/86351003.cms||Dipawali Mitra

Officials said that a total of 1,810 persons were inoculated from the NKDA centers on last Saturday, the single day highest so far, exceeding the day’s target to inoculate 1,350 persons. All the three NKDA vaccination centers at the Pride building complex, NKDA football stadium and the tank no 12 centre were operational on Sunday. “It is the state’s strategy is to cover as many persons as possible with their Covid vaccination before puja. We have taken up this drive to accelerate the vaccination rate in the NKDA centers by mobilizing our staff including nurses and data operators to take up the drive. Apart from residents of New Town, many are also coming from periphery areas. We have asked the resident welfare associations to inform us as to who are still left out from taking the vaccine jab. Over 52,500 persons have been inoculated in New Town so far since vaccination drive started,” said NKDA chairman Debashis Sen. Officials said that the vaccination drive that have been usually going on ends around 2pm but in the last three days, it continued till late afternoon to mop up as much as number of people as possible. Volunteers of New Town Forum and News (NTFN), an umbrella organsiation of residents forum in New Town, assisted NKDA in the vaccination drive. NTFN have been gathering and providing information as to who in New Town were still yet to get the vaccinated. In Salt Lake, the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) ward coordinators are periodically organising vaccination camps at the ward offices or community centers to inoculate residents and others including domestic helps, drivers and street vendors with their first or second dose of vaccines. Officials said that on an average around 2,500 persons were getting vaccinated daily. BMC authorities have been conducting a survey to find out how many have been left to the vaccinated as over 30% of residents in BMC area have been fully vaccinated and about half of the population have received their first dose of vaccine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/suman-nkda-vaccine-mop-up-drive-19-09-21/articleshow/86351035.cms||Suman Chakraborti

A 25-year-old Indian-origin space scientist, who has trained and worked with space agencies Nasa and European Space Agency (ESA) on key inter-planetary missions and aspires to be a full-fledged astronaut in order to become the first Indian to reach Moon and Mars, has set up an NGO in the US to “provide resources to young Indian students from low socio-economic strata to give them exposure to space facilities abroad”. Priya, who did her masters in space sciences engineering from the University College London in 2017 and is currently pursuing her PhD from the same university in coordination with Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in a telephonic interview, told TOI that “the idea behind setting up NGO Sharda Foundation, named after my grandmother, is to bring talented and passionate Indian school students to a space agency facility abroad, either Nasa or ESA, to allow students to experience the space culture in various countries. I want to bring resources to my home country where there is ample talent and passion for space exploration”. “My parents gave me these opportunities through the sacrifices they made as they moved out of India. I was fortunate enough to have this experience but now I want to ensure that such experiences are shared with those that are truly passionate about space, but do not have the resources to follow their passion,” the space engineer, who is also training to become an aerobatic pilot, told TOI. Priya, who was born in Gujarat’s Kadi town and did her schooling from Gandhinagar before moving to London in 2005, earned her bachelor’s degree in physics from Imperial College London. Besides her space projects, she has also been “training in Bharatanatyam for over 12 years and participated in various national and international performances”. The 25-year-old is currently working on collecting atmospheric data from Nasa’s Perseverance Rover, which landed on the Red planet on February 18 this year, to study the presence of water on Mars. She had earlier analysed data from Mars climate sounder on board Nasa’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) to conduct the Martian atmospheric research. “Working with Nasa on a fantastic mission (Perseverance) is truly a dream come true and I am happy to be representing Indian women in STEM,” she said. Priya has worked at the ESA as a systems engineer on an upcoming gravitational waves detecting mission called Laser Interferometry Space Antenna (LISA), which will be the first space-based gravitational wave observatory that will be launched in 2034, and is also engaged in ESA’s Exomars rover that will be launched next year to measure water on Mars. “I am extremely lucky to be working alongside experts from all over the world from whom I draw inspiration for my work,” she said. She is also passionate about STEM advocacy and is part of the ‘Rocket Women’ team, a team aiming to empower Indian, especially Indian girls, to choose a STEM career, along with providing support, encouragement and importantly a community.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/indian-origin-space-scientist-gives-wings-to-poor-desi-students-space-dreams/articleshow/86355844.cms||Surendra Singh

---||Kochi||Councillors upset over move to award works at low rates||Thiruvananthapuram: The decision of the works standing committee to award civil works at extremely low rates than the original has stirred up dissent among ward councillors. The recent council meeting saw councillors voicing their concerns over the practice of awarding works at unacceptably low rates, which result in poor quality. Nearly 20 works which were presented in the council pertaining to re-tarring, stormwater drains, renovation of anganwadis, concrete works and other kinds of civil works were awarded at 31% lower rates than the original estimate. The construction of a protection wall, concreting of bylane at Sreekaryam was awarded at 30.05% below rate. Concreting and reconcreting works in different bylanes in Kadakampally ward were awarded at 31.7% lower than the actual estimate. Similarly, extremely low rates below the estimate were approved for various works in Kattaikonam, Karikkakom, Kulathor, Mannanthala and Edavakkodu. Works standing committee chairman D R Anil who tackled collective concerns from councillors put forth a seemingly improbable solution. “What we can do to avoid substandard works is that we should enlighten residents in the area. They should show more vigil and concern regarding monitoring of works,” he said. His suggestion apparently did not enthuse even the councillors of the ruling council. The corporation contractors had often warned the engineering wing and the works standing committee about the dangers of awarding works at lower rates. “They just want to get the work done. We are forced to compromise on the quality. A road which is supposed to last for minimum three years will again be in the tender list for repair within a year,” a contractor said. More than 60% of the works which were presented in the council for approval were categorized as either renovation or retarring, which was reflective of the low quality of works being undertaken in the city. The corporation contractors have also been pressing the civic body to give them the present market rate for bitumen. They had submitted a letter to mayor Arya Rajendran citing their demands. According to corporation contractors, the market rate of bitumen is much more than the estimate rate of their works. They said that despite a government order being in effect that approves the cost difference, the corporation officials have not taken a positive stand on the issue. The corporation officials said that such cost difference has not been implemented in any of the civic bodies and the city corporation cannot give an exception. The contractors, however, cite examples of local bodies which have implemented the government order and approved the cost difference.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/councillors-upset-over-move-to-award-works-at-low-rates/articleshow/86351074.cms||Aswin J Kumar
---||Varanasi||SCs, STs suffered most during SP regime, says Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath||VARANASI: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath asked BJP’S Scheduled Caste wing to hold conventions in all the 75 districts of UP and to tell SC population about the measures taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for their upliftment. The CM targeted Samajwadi Party for starvation deaths in its regime and alleged that instead of giving ration cards to the poor, SCs and STs, they were given to SP workers and office-bearers. Addressing the valedictory session of the two-day national executive meet of BJP’s SC wing at Pt Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Trade Facilitation Centre here on Sunday, Yogi said, “Before I became the CM, the state witnessed large number of starvation cases during the SP regime. Most of the people who died of hunger were from the SC and ST classes. When I ordered verification of ration cards after becoming CM, it came to light that 40% ration cards were issued in the names of SP office-bearers, workers and even fair price shop owners. We cancelled these ration cards and gave them to the deserving beneficiaries.” During earlier pandemics, more deaths were caused due to hunger and not because of diseases, he said and praised the PM for ensuring that no one died due to hunger during the biggest worldwide Covid-19 pandemic of the century. “Since 1998, I kept raising the issue of Japanese Encephalitis in the Parliament as an MP as this disease was claiming hundreds of lives, especially in two divisions of the state. However, no government at Centre paid attention, nor did it take any remedial action despite the fact that most of the children dying of JE belonged to SC, ST, most backward classes and minorities. After coming to power, I ensured acceleration of the pace of sanitation drive launched by PM in 2014 apart from ensuring availability of treatment and test facilities and JE has almost been eliminated.” The country had many PMs before Modi, but the problems of the poor, SC, ST and OBC were not solved by them though they continued coming back to power by dividing the society on caste lines, said Yogi. “PM Modi launched a massive sanitation drive and construction of toilets, which ensured the dignity of women and vastly improved the health status of the society,” the CM added. Recalling the three-day campaigning ban imposed on him by the election commission during 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Yogi said he got an invite from Mahadev Harijan of Ayodhya in this period. “Mahadev showed me his house constructed under PM Awas Yojana, power and LPG connections, ration and Ayushman cards apart from mentioning the benefits of Jan Dhan Yojana he had got. Mahadev told me that he worked for one political party in the past but got all benefits in PM Modi’s regime,” he added. Mentioning the background of the authors of the epics Ramayana and Mahabharata, Yogi said the reasons for marginalizing the SC should be studied to know why efforts were always made to divide society in the name of caste. Yogi praised Bharat Ratna Dr BR Ambedkar for his association with the roots of the country and its culture despite going abroad for higher studies after facing hardships in early life. He said, “Dr Ambedkar gave such a Constitution to India which ensured fundamental rights to all, irrespective of caste, creed and faith.” Highlighting the initiatives of PM for developing memorials, including Panch Tirtha at places associated with the life of Dr Ambedkar, he said, even the places associated with other legendary personalities like Maharshi Valmiki, Sant Ravidas and others are being developed to ensure that future generations of country are inspired by them. Thanking the party’s SC wing for holding its national executive in Varanasi, Yogi appealed to its leaders to hold convention in each of 75 districts of UP as a part of the ongoing Amrit Mahotsava to make SCs aware about all the government schemes and tell them how they can take optimum benefits from them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/starvation-deaths-in-previous-regime-due-to-corruption-scs-sts-suffered-most-yogi/articleshow/86351042.cms||Rajeev Dikshit
---||Kolkata||Land hurdle hits New Garia-Airport Metro work||Kolkata: The slow-paced land acquisition process is jeopardising the New Garia-Airport Metro project. The worst affected is work at New Garia station. Out of the total 20,180 square-metre land required for the station hub, 13,941sqm plot is yet to be acquired, causing massive time and cost overrun. In fact, a truncated Metro operation is scheduled to be started early next year from Kabi Subhas (New Garia) to Hemanta (Ruby). “We are running out of time to complete the work. After a long legal battle, we managed to get the land to build the ramp connecting the station with the yard. A massive chunk of land is still needed at the earliest to make it operational,” said an officer of Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL), the implementing agency for the project. The longest of the Metro alignments is likely to change the way citizens travel to and from the airport and the southernmost end of the city. But the pandemic seems to have dealt a severe blow to the project. The New Garia station hub is spread over Balia, Birzi and Garagacha area. So far, in Balia, no land has been acquired out of the 4,483 square metres required. Similarly, no land has been obtained out of the 2,178 square metres required in Birzi. Only in Garagacha, 5,386 square metres of land could be procured. New Garia station is a major Metro hub where the New Garia-Airport alignment will merge with the existing New Garia-Dakshineswar Metro. Apart from this, New Garia station will have provision for its proposed extension till Baruipur. Apart from the land hurdle at the new station, the elevated corridor is faltering in the Dhapa area, where 669 square metres is needed for erection of the three piers (310-312). “Because of the Metro construction, Kolkatans have endured enough trouble as the these areas were often cut off from the carriageways. The faster it is completed, the smoother the ride will be,” said an official. Due to the pandemic, most offices had been closed for a long period. Even after partial reopening, restrictions were imposed on public transport. Hearing of land cases, verification and possession of plot were affected due to fear of landowners attending the proceedings in the office of the Competent Authority (land acquisition office). “Though all offices, including the courts of Competent Authority and Appellate authority, were functioning with 25% attendance, with limited public transport since May 15, we are requesting the land acquisition officer to expedite the proceedings,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/land-hurdle-hits-new-garia-airport-metro-work/articleshow/86351038.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay

While the biggest state run paediatric tertiary care centre, Niloufer Hospital, has almost all of its 800 beds full, private hospitals too are seeing nearly full occupancy. “Around 40% of cases are dengue, remaining are viral fevers, upper respiratory infections and unexplained fevers too. However, the most serious thing right now is dengue as even a little delay in seeking treatment is resulting in children landing in a critical condition,” said Dr Ravi Kumar, senior professor, Niloufer Hospital. Dr Kumar said that almost all the 800 beds were full and the outpatient footfalls of paediatric patients had crossed 5,500 so far this month. The number of fever cases for the season at individual hospitals was also far more than the cases reported last year. “We have had many more fever cases this year in the OPD. Mainly dengue and a few cases of Covid-19. Many of the dengue cases required admission,” said Dr Sai Suveer Reddy, consultant paediatrician, Apollo Cradle and Children’s Hospital, Kondapur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/fever-rush-fills-hospital-beds/articleshow/86353281.cms||Amrita Didyala
---||Hubballi||Unscientific speedbreakers return to haunt Hubballi-Dharwad’s motorists||HUBBALLI: The roads of the twin cities have been re-laid, with concrete replacing asphalt on several thoroughfares. However, these new roads have resurrected an old problem: Unscientific speedbreakers or humps. Following a petition filed in the court by Sadbhavana Samiti in 2015, the Hubballi court had directed the civic authorities to rid the twin cities’ roads of unscientific humps. Speedbreakers, the order added, were to be built in accordance with the norms laid down by the Road Congress. In pursuance of the court’s orders, the unscientific humps were removed from the roads across Hubballi-Dharwad. However, after the roads were concretised, the humps on the new roads turned out to be as poorly placed as the ones that had been cleared a few years ago. Sadbhavana Samiti secretary Sanjay Shetti rued the apathetic attitude of the civic authorities concerned. “The court specifically ordered the removal of the unscientific humps, but these obstacles are back on the streets of the twin cities. We will raise the issue again, and meet the Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation (HDMC) commissioner, and bring to his notice the court’s orders about the unscientific humps,” Shetti said. Activist Mohan C said that even the highways were not free of the problem. “The Pune-Bengaluru road and the streets in the new areas on the outskirts are riddled with unscientific speedbreakers. When we bring this to the attention of the public works department and other agencies, they pass the buck, shifting the blame to other civic agencies,” Mohan said. Following the judgment by the Hubballi court, HDMC spent funds to the tune of lakhs of rupees to remove the unscientific humps, pointed out activist Gurunath Ullikashi. “Once that was completed, the HDMC must have built new speedbreakers to check speeding on the roads. One can spot unscientific humps near accident spots, which could precipitate more tragedies, particularly during the night when they may not be visible to motorists,” said Ullikashi. HDMC superintending engineer Timmappa E said, “We will take all the necessary measures and ensure that humps are built in a manner as prescribed by the Road Congress.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/unscientific-speedbreakers-return-to-haunt-twin-cities-motorists/articleshow/86349089.cms||J Abbas Mulla

A quick scan of the 2016 official survey, conducted across the 84 villages, shows that there are at least 86 government institutions that have illegally made their way into this belt, protected by law to preserve Hyderabad’s drinking water reservoirs – Osmansagar and Himayatsagar. These government structures include,“electricity offices, schools, Gram Panchayat buildings, Anganwadi centres, SHG building, police stations and other offices,” reads the document submitted to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) that was hearing a case on GO 111 during that time. While there has been no official enumeration since then, environmentalists claim that more such ventures, like community halls and government-owned plotted layouts, have cropped up in the last five years. “When the government itself is hand in glove with the offenders, how can you expect appropriate implementation of GO 111? I think they should just de-notify the two water bodies and declare that they are no longer drinking water sources. Why pretend to be protecting them?" said veteran environmentalist Capt J Rama Rao, who through a series of letters consistently highlighted the blatant violation of GO 111. In one letter from 2015, he even called out the government for alienating 30 acres of its land in Cherlaguda (one of the 84 villages) to an educational institution. “In many instances the government has changed the land use from conservation zone to residential zone for the benefit of private parties. That’s deplorable,” Capt Rao said. In fact, some environmentalists claim that the government has even allotted over 200 acres across Vattinagulapally, Khanapur and Chilkur to senior government officials and political leaders to build homes, despite knowing that it falls within the purview of GO 111.  Some government officials denied to speak terming the subject “sensitive”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/86-govt-buildings-illegally-built-on-go-111-areas/articleshow/86353257.cms||Sudipta Sengupta

Ramesh Makwana, a resident of the Pipli village, was booked for threatening and abetting the suicide of his neighbour and his two daughters, police said. At the root of the confrontation was a neem tree in Nanji Makwana’s yard whose leaves used to fall over the adjacent house, which belonged to Ramesh. After Ramesh threatened his neighbours over the issue, 42-year-old Nanji and his two daughters — 22-year-old Anjana and 19-year-old Bharti — allegedly consumed poisonous substances on the night of September 17, police said. “They were taken to the Civil Hospital in Jamnagar and their condition is stated to be stable now.

Those drowned have been identified as Satinder Singh of Adarsh Nagar, Yamunanagar Camp Area, who went to disperse ashes at about 8.30am, a diver Surender Kumar of Sisai village in Hisar district and Vijay alias Vicky Dhawan (Satinder’s neighbour) of Yamunanagar. The rescue boat carried six persons, including Radaur sub-division patwari Dharmender, two firemen and two divers, including Surender, deputed by Yamunanagar-Jagadhri municipal corporation (MC), and Vijay, said Yamunanagar deputy commissioner (DC) Parth Gupta. “The patwari two firemen and one unknown diver were rescued from the canal after their boat capsized, but Surender and Vijay went missing in the high flow of water,” the DC said. Police teams also reached the Yamunanagar City police station area. Satinder had gone to the WJC Hamida head to disperse the ashes of his relative when he somehow drowned in the canal, said Hamid police post-in-charge sub-inspector (SI) Satpal. “After the incident, the district administration deputed a rescue team into the canal to search for Satinder in a boat which capsized after it got stuck into the high flow waterfall of the canal.

Kerala state handicapped persons welfare corporation is implementing the project at a cost of Rs 68 lakh. The officials said the showroom will provide the equipment for the disabled persons at a cost comparatively lesser than private companies. The equipment will be available for 21 categories of disabilities. The project management consultancy is Kerala Electrical and Allied Engineering Company Limited and it will be completed in a total budget of 3.18 crore. Officials are also intending to launch an online portal to sell this equipment as well as things manufactured by people with disabilities such as umbrellas, paper pens, and other items.  The portal will also provide all relevant information about a product, including its dimensions and other characteristics. The equipment can be customized according to the needs and the officials at the showroom will also train people on how to use it. The showroom will also have lifts and restrooms designed specifically for those with disabilities, a project official said. “The majority of the showrooms will not include accessibility features that allow handicapped people to access all areas of the showroom. In this showroom, we are constructing it according to the convenience of disabled persons. People will be able to travel and visit destinations just by sitting in a room with the help of 5D virtual reality. This will make them feel that they have actually visited the place. Our aim is to bring more facilities for these people,” the official said. The construction of the showroom that is coming up near the head office at Poojappura has been delayed due to the pandemic. It will take around a year to complete this project. The equipment for the showroom will be supplied by different companies and a few by Upakarana Unit, Parassala.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/showroom-with-5d-vr-for-disabled-people/articleshow/86351127.cms||---

The accused, Umakanta Patra from Egra, was arrested. The girl’s father lodged a complaint at Marishda police station on Saturday, saying the 17-year-old went for her tuition at 7am but did not return. Cops investigated and found Patra had boarded a flight to Delhi from Kolkata at 2.20pm. Mission Mukti Foundation received this information and swung into action. They helped rescue the girl and detain the accused once the flight landed at Indira Gandhi International Airport around 4.40pm. “Traffickers are using the air route for fast movement of victims,” said Virender Kumar Singh, director, Mission Mukti Foundation. SI Dilip Kr Gupta, Marishda police station, and relatives of the girl, arrived in Delhi on Sunday to take custody of the accused and the girl.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/trafficked-girl-rescued-within-10-hrs/articleshow/86351080.cms||---

Even though patients report moderate to high fever, all possible tests run on them for detecting the cause of the fever turn out to be normal. “Currently, around 20-25% of the cases of fever we are getting are of this type. These patients test negative for all the current causes of fever, including dengue, respiratory syncytial virus (SRV), influenza and even RTPCR tests for Covid-19 as well as the antibodies tests. We have seen such cases in children aged between 1 year and 5 years over the last one-and-half month,” said Dr Parag Shankarrao Dekate, clinical director, paediatrics and head of paediatric intensive care, KIMS Cuddles, adding that in majority of these cases, the patient’s condition improves in six to seven days. However, the patient’s condition does not improve in all cases, and this has led to parents running from pillar to post. “My 17-year-old son has been sick for the last 20 days and we have changed three doctors so far. All possible tests were run including complete blood picture, dengue, malaria, typhoid and even Covid-19 but everything seems normal. However, his fever, which comes in bouts twice a day, continues to be around 102 to 103 degrees and does not subside,” said Mihirunissa Begum of Begumpet, adding that several such cases are being reported in their area where unexplained fevers last for more than 10 to 12 days. Unexplained fevers have also been reported at the Apollo Cradle and Children’s Hospital, confirmed officials. “When we say viral fevers, we don’t pursue the diagnosis of the virus as there are hundreds of viruses and these fevers usually get better within a week. The unexplained fevers are the ones which get prolonged, are not getting better and all the tests that are run turn out to be negative,” said Dr Satish Ghanta, paediatric intensivist, Little Stars Children’s Hospital. While some hospitals have run all tests to rule out any known causes including Covid-19 and dengue, the state-run hospitals do not run these tests but have reported these cases as well. Nearly 30% of the current fever cases landing up at the Niloufer Hospital fall in this category, said officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/mystery-fever-in-kids-stumps-docs-gives-parents-a-headache/articleshow/86353255.cms||Amrita Didyala

During the past 4.5 years, fertilizer plant, which was closed for more than two-and-half decades, became operational and AIIMS was also established in Gorakhpur in the same period, he added. “The sugar mill at Pipraich became operational and will create more employment opportunities and check migration. The Yogi Adityanath government provided benefits to all, including poor, women, youth, farmers without any discrimination. CM Yogi Adityanath is making the dream of Ram Rajya true,” said Shastri while addressing media persons in Gorakhpur. “The government has worked for all and changed the image of the district. The city once known as the city of crime and mafia is now known for its development. Today Gorakhpur is connected to the country with road, rail and air which is necessary for development. In the past 4.5 years, many projects were started for develoment of Gorakhpur and many of them have been already completed while others are on the verge of completion and by December, 300 projects will be hopefully finished,” he said. “Yogi Government worked on the development of tourist places and today places like Gorakhnath temple, Gita Press, Ramgarhtal, Surajkund dham, Shaheed Ashfaqullah Khan zoo are attracting tourists and in the coming days the city will become a tourist hub,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/gorakhpur-treading-on-path-of-devpt-as-yogi-govt-provided-benefits-to-all-min/articleshow/86351108.cms||---

Instead of calling the HDMC control room to shift the carcasses, animal owners are dumping them on the roads. Harshavardhan Sheelavant, an environmentalist, said that some animal keepers are throwing carcasses of domestic animals like buffaloes by bringing them in waste bags. “Stray dogs and pigs pull such carcasses and scatter the remnants. We observed six carcasses last week at Manjunathapur alone. We recently buried a carcass in an abandoned garden. Many citizens, who pass by, don’t bother about informing the HDMC control room. One should remember that carcasses spread viruses and diseases,” he said. Rajkumar Madiwalar, a resident of Srinagar, Dharwad, said that many families are involved in animal husbandry and they throw carcases abruptly. “One can see the animal’s blood and body parts from Shivaji Circle to Navalgund Road. Both the public and the HDMC should find a solution for this menace. We feel many animal keepers are not trained and sensitised in this regard,” he said. Santoshkumar B Yarangali, executive engineer, solid waste management, HDMC, said that HDMC has dedicated vehicles to lift carcasses of any animals including cats and dogs. “As soon as we receive complaints to the control room, our personnel lift the carcass within 2-3 hours. We have instructed our health inspectors and civic workers to lift carcasses found on roads. People should cooperate with us by informing our control room” he said. He also assured of conducting training and awareness programmes for animal keepers to sensitise them on this issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/carcasses-thrown-on-roads-worry-residents/articleshow/86349111.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai
---||Gurgaon||Dialogue between farmers and govt must remain open, says Venkaiah Naidu||GURUGRAM: All governments must “give priority” to the welfare of farmers and keep the room for dialogue open with them, Vice-President M Venkaiah Naidu said on Sunday. He added that the issue of farmers must not be mixed with politics. Naidu was in the city to launch five volumes of Sir Chhotu Ram: Writings and Speeches, which is based on the life, work and principles of Deenbandhu Sir Chhotu Ram. While speaking at the event, he referred to the protest by farmers, which has been underway for almost 10 months now. “All governments should focus on and give priority to farmers, their welfare. I am not talking of politics, dialogue must always keep happening between the government and farmers. The issues of farmers should not be linked with politics. If you mix them with politics…there will be a division. Politics has come, you are seeing what is happening,” Naidu said. He also emphasised on the need for people to be ready for “change” and “new ideas”. “In the political sphere, political roots should be respected. In the manifesto, what they want to do, what they will do should be clearly written. Afterwards, it should be assessed… but we must always be ready for change, new ideas,” he said. Naidu spoke of the need to transform the country into a “one food zone”, with an open market system under which farmers can sell their crops anywhere. This, he said, would stop the exploitation of the farmer community. “This is in the interest of the country and also in the interest of farmers…. It is very important because 50% of the people in the country depend on agriculture even today…. Helping farmers is everyone’s job, and everyone should come out of politics and focus more on these topics,” he said. The Vice-President described agriculture as the “basic culture” of India and the “backbone of our economy”, saying it helped propagate “traditions”. “Agriculture is our basic culture, agriculture has traditionally been the backbone of our economy. It has been the endeavour of every government to improve the living conditions of farmers and provide remunerative prices to various crafts. Our villages not only produce food grains for us but also circulate our sanskaras among our children, our values and traditions,” said Naidu. “This is very important because nowadays, we are seeing a decline of standards, a decline of values in politics, in public life, in academic life, in the legislature, in Parliament, in assemblies, everywhere. This has to be re-established again,” he said. Apart from agriculture, the Vice-President also stressed on the importance of Hindi, without which, he said, “it’s not possible to progress in India”. “More than the importance of the language, I am speaking of the fact that more people know, speak and read this language. That is why this language is very important. Even when I go to Chennai, I tell the people there, ‘don’t oppose a language, try to learn it’. Yes, English is important. But first, learn your mother-tongue…. If you want to meet people in India, tell them your sentiments, you have to learn that language as well,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/dialogue-between-farmers-and-govt-must-remain-open-says-venkaiah/articleshow/86353322.cms||Sakshi Dayal

If caught without a valid PUC certificate, vehicle owners may face imprisonment up to six months or fine up to Rs 10,000 or both. They will also be disqualified to hold their driving licence for three months, stated a public notice issued by transport department on Sunday. “In its ongoing efforts to control pollution and improve air quality, transport department requests all motor vehicle owners in Delhi to ply their vehicles with valid PUC certificate,” it said. Vehicles are periodically tested for their emission standards for various pollutants such as carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, after which they are given PUC certificates.  “All registered vehicle owners are requested to get their vehicles checked from the pollution checking centres authorised by transport department to avoid any penalty/ imprisonment/ suspension of driving licence,” stated the public notice. There are over 900 pollution checking centres authorised by the transport department in Delhi. These are set up at petrol pumps and workshops spread all over the city so motorists can get it done easily. The centres conduct pollution checking facilities and issue PUC certificate to vehicles complying with prescribed pollution norms. PUC certification has been made real time and integrated with the vehicle registration database.  This has improved credibility of PUC certification by reducing human intervention and helps in identifying polluting vehicles for necessary punitive action.  The fee for pollution checking in case of petrol and CNG driven two and three wheelers is Rs 60. It is Rs 80 for four-wheeled vehicles. The fee for pollution checking certificate of diesel vehicles is Rs 100.  According to Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, every motor vehicle (including those conforming to BS-I/ BS-II/ BS-III/BS-IV as well as vehicles plying on CNG/LPG) is required to carry a valid PUC Certificate after the expiry of period of one year from the date of its first registration. However, the validity of four-wheeled BS-IV compliant vehicles is one year and for other vehicles it is three months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/you-may-face-up-to-rs-10000-fine-or-6-month-jail-if-your-vehicle-doesnt-have-puc/articleshow/86353329.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata Police plans to rope in rappers to spread awareness on manja menace||KOLKATA: To tackle the Chinese manja menace, police have decided to reach out to rappers, who can use their large fan following to spread awareness and warn people of the potential dangers of this type of kite string. Adnan Hitzz, a rapper from Park Circus, lauded the Kolkata Police initiative, saying, “Rap songs are a good medium to spread awareness, especially among youths. With catchy lyrics and rhythm, we can spread the message that someone’s fun is causing innumerable accidents and one should be more responsible,” said the 21-year old member of Youngsters Production. Zeeshan Hasan, another rapper from Park Circus, said, “Rap songs are always socially conscious and can be used to spread awareness. Since the target audience are youngsters, the poetry should be youthful and the language must be local — a mix of Hindi and Urdu. Through raps, we can send out the message of not using the sharp Chinese manja and avoiding crowded places to fly kites because that may prove fatal for someone.” The rappers, police said, are immensely popular and were an automatic choice to spread awareness. “However, we are still working on how to involve them. The awareness programmes will coincide with the festive season,” said an officer. During interactions with locals on the sidelines of awareness campaigns in the lanes and bylanes over the weekend, cops also explained their plans in tackling the manja problem that has so far injured 16 people in the city in the past four months — 13 on Maa flyover alone. KMDA is setting up safety nets on a flyover and police are taking legal action against anyone selling illegal Chinese manja. Cops said besides the wire netting, they are launching a door-to-door campaign where the youngest members of the family will be made aware of the dangers of manja so that they stay away from such kite string. Police sources said surprise raids will continue in the four police station areas of Karaya, Topsia, Beniapukur and Tiljala, which are in close proximity to Maa and AJC Bose Road flyovers. The Chinese manja is a nylon thread coated with glass and metal dusts like lead and copper and can create gashes on people or birds moving at speed. Despite a ban, there has been limited awareness and decrease in its use.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kolkata-police-plans-to-rope-in-rappers-to-spread-awareness-on-manja-menace/articleshow/86351132.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The BJP, however, has already spoken to the senior leaders of the JD(S), including the party’s state minority wing leader Nasir Hussain. The JD(S) corporators elected to the KCC Council have made it clear that they will offer their support only to the party that will offer them the mayor’s post. Nasir Hussain said that, while his party was open to an alliance with both the Congress and the JD(S), nobody from the Congress had spoken to the leadership of the regional party. “No leader of the Karnataka Congress spoke to the JD(S) leadership till veteran leader Kharge reached out to us. Former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy has made it clear the JD(S) corporators will extend support only to the party that offers the mayor’s seat, and that is our final decision. It is not enough for the Congress to merely claim it is a secular party.

Prakasam barrage in city had received heavy inflows on Saturday. Floodwater from Munneru rivulet is the main reason for the inflows to the project. Prakasam barrage received around 2 lakh cusecs of flood inflow in the last two days. However, tensions eased by Sunday evening as flood level reduced to 84,000 cusecs. Officials also kept a close watch on rainfall in Telangana region which is causing flood in Munneru. Krishna district administration initially issued alert to the tahsildars in the 18 mandals at the downstream of Prakasam barrage, but withdrew it later. The VMC authorities had arranged flood relief camps as a precautionary measure. Krishna river is receiving flood since July last. Crest gates at Prakasam barrage remained open for almost 40 days and officials are releasing surplus flood into the Bay of Bengal. Barrage received a flood of 4.5 lakh cusecs in August when the crest gate at Pulichintala project was washed away. Authorities expect the flood levels at Prakasam barrage to continue till October second week, going by the IMD weather forecast .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/relief-as-flood-waters-recede-in-krishna/articleshow/86351121.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Police’s primary probe revealed that Keshawala used to regularly talk with Kamaliya’s wife over phone. “They were reportedly in love. Kamaliya too grew suspicious about their relationship. Few days back he stumbled upon a recording of a conversation between his wife and Keshwala. Since then, he decided to kill Keshwala,” a police official said. On the night of September 16, Kamaliya intercepted Keshwala near Galiyad town and stabbed him to death, police said.

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Krishna river turning safe route for liquor smugglers||VIJAYAWADA: Of late, smugglers are choosing Krishna river as a safe passage for bringing liquor from other states. The Non Duty Paid Liquor (NDPL) which is mostly coming from Goa and Karnataka makes entry into Andhra Pradesh through Krishna river. Smugglers are using small boats to cross the river from Telangana to state mostly in Guntur district. As the Special Enforcement Bureau (SEB) vigilance has increased on the roadways, liquor smugglers are choosing waterway for hassle-free transport of NDPL. High prices of liquor and non-availability of well-known brands have created unprecedented demand in Andhra Pradesh which resulted in NDPL being smuggled from other states. Krishna and Guntur districts which share vast boundary with Telangana have become vulnerable to liquor smuggling. Though the bootleggers used to get the contraband through roadways, it has become a tough task with increased vigilance and intelligence collection by the SEB. To escape the radar of SEB, the liquor smugglers have now shifted to waterways, especially through Krishna river which flows along the western and northern boundaries of Guntur district. They are bringing the liquor from interior villages in Nagarjuna Sagar, Macherla and Durgi mandals located on the banks of Krishna in Guntur district. The recent busts by the SEB in Guntur district suggest that liquor from Karnataka and Goa is coming to Andhra Pradesh from Telangana. The modus operandi of the smugglers is to bring liquor bottles by concealing them in concrete ready-mix vehicles. They find it an effective way to evade the radar of police as they will not suspect these vehicles because of the presence of a large number of cement factories in this area of Telangana. Moreover, the vigilance by Telangana police is comparatively low on liquor smuggling. Crossing border is the main task for the smugglers for which they choose Krishna river. “Though bringing liquor from Karnataka and Goa involves huge transportation costs, smugglers still find it profitable when compared to the prices in Andhra Pradesh,” said a senior official in SEB.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/krishna-river-turning-safe-route-for-liquor-smugglers/articleshow/86351158.cms||Srikanth Aluri
---||Delhi||Bareilly-based trafficker who supplied drugs in Delhi held||New Delhi: Delhi Police Crime Branch has arrested a Bareilly-based drug trafficker who was one of the prime sources of heroin supply to the capital. The accused has been identified as Taimoor Khan alias Bhola. DCP (crime) Chinmoy Biswal said that Khan had a reward of Rs 1.5 lakh on his arrest by police in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh. “He was wanted in nine cases where he was accused under the NDPS Act,” Biswal added. Khan (37) had been declared an absconder by the court in multiple cases. He joined the narcotics trade in 2007 and was evading arrest since 2012. The arrest had made a huge dent in the Bareilly-Delhi narcotics network, the cops said. Police had been conducting frequent raids at his village Behra and neighbouring areas in Bareilly, but Khan managed to give them a slip each time using his information network. He had adopted the name ‘Bhola’ for trafficking activities. According to police, he had made a “Robinhood-type image” in and around his village by paying money to children and the elderly on a regular basis. So, he was alerted about any outside vehicle or individual’s movements in the area well in advance. Khan had made his hideouts in sugarcane fields, which proved very difficult to invade. “His cat-and-mouse game had even become popular among the children of his village, who donned the roles of cops and Khan to play a tweaked version of ‘chor-police’. The game was named ‘Bhola bhag gaya’ by the children,” DCP Biswal claimed. Khan was finally arrested by a team led by ACP Mayank Bansal from Seelampur in northeast Delhi after a tip-off. He had recently relocated there in the wake of mounting police pressure and the arrest of his closest associate, Shahid, by the UP police. He suspected that Shahid may have blown his cover. Khan had started off as a carrier but soon built his own supply network. A few years ago, he took to manufacturing heroin using crude opium after learning the tricks of the trade from an Afghan drug trafficker. “He then joined hands with traffickers from Jharkhand, West Bengal and Manipur. His rise in drug trafficking inspired many youngsters of the area, and many of them are in jail now,” the DCP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bareilly-based-trafficker-who-supplied-drugs-in-delhi-held/articleshow/86353353.cms||---

Simha said that he had discussed the issue with chief minister Basavaraj Bommai, who was on board with the plan. Simha said that the CM would flag off work on the new temple. “The temple will not come up at the same site, but built at another location,” Simha added. Simha has been at the forefront of the agitation against the demolition of temples across the district. He has been fighting to conserve the 101 Ganapathi temple in Agrahara in Mysuru. The Mahadevamma temple in Huchagani village was demolished on September 8 at the instance of the taluk administration of Nanjangud, who ordered it razed citing unauthorised construction on government property. The MP said that he had had an informal discussion with CM Bommai about the need to protect Hindu shrines from the threat of demolition. “The CM assured me that the state government is committed to protecting Hindu places of worship. We will take the legal route to protect the temples. In the next few days, the government will publicly unveil its policy to ensure Hindu temples are legally protected,” Simha added. He said that, in the event of the state government not extending financial support for the construction of the new temple, the BJP, along with Hindu organisations, would collect money from the people to build the new shrine in Huchagani village.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/we-will-rebuild-temple-in-nanjangud-village-says-simha/articleshow/86349851.cms||---
---||Kolkata||‘Smaller idols lead to greater water pollution, adverse health impact’||Kolkata: The smaller the idol, the greater the risk of water pollution, said environmentalists. By a conservative estimate, more than 20,000 Vishwakarma idols are immersed in the Ganges and different tanks. But the promptness of civic bodies to recover the structures — which is witnessed after immersion of Durga and Kali idols — is absent in case of other smaller pujas. “It is impossible to track the number of pujas, like Vishwakarma or Saraswati. But if you assess the impact, the immersion of a 100 times higher number of smaller idols compared to those of Durga Puja or Kali Puja leads to more pollution,” said Naba Dutta, general secretary, Sauj Mancha. The biggest concern is the presence of heavy metals in the paint on idols, which enters the body through the food chain. Some, like lead, mercury, zinc oxide and chromium, are potent carcinogens, said Sudipta Bhattachary of Saviour and Friends of Environment, who conducted a study on post-immersion water quality. Lead and chromium are toxic to humans even in very small quantities. “Idol immersion poisons the waters by increasing acidity and can damage the ecosystem,” said Somendra Mohan Ghosh, an environmental activist. National Mission for Clean Ganga banned immersion in the Ganges and imposed a fine of Rs 50,000 for violation. “Adequate arrangements should be made for designated immersion sites within the municipal area or bank of Ganges and its tributaries by constructing temporary confined ponds with removable synthetic liners at the bottom. However, nothing is followed in reality,” said Subhas Datta, an environmental crusader.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/smaller-idols-lead-to-greater-water-pollution-adverse-health-impact/articleshow/86351160.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Hyderabad||Students grappling with basics, teachers with overshooting deadlines||HYDERABAD: Teachers, especially those from government and private budget schools, are busy teaching basics — reading, writing, multiplication, division— instead of going ahead with the current academic year’s syllabus and preparing students for board examinations. Even as teachers are happy to see students back in schools, they said that children have changed a lot in many aspects, and even those who were considered intelligent before the onset of the coronavirus pandemic are not in a position to grasp concepts or jot down what’s written on the board. “It will take at least this academic year to bring children back on track,” said Thota Kavitha, a government teacher, who teaches physics for classes 8, 9, and 10 students in the city. She said that children cannot be blamed for not making education their priority during the last 18 months as many had to struggle for basics — food, clothing, and shelter, which in turn, affected their physical as well as mental health. “While I could complete a chapter in four or five days, I could hardly complete a chapter in the last 10 days as I had to explain keywords and concepts, which were taught in previous classes, as students are unable to recall anything,” she added. Teachers said that digital/online classes had made little to no difference as quite a few could not attend as they were busy working to earn a livelihood, lack of devices and the internet, and even those who attended could not grasp much as there was no continuity. Students were struggling in subjects like physics, mathematics and English, said teachers. “Very few students seem to have attended digital classes. The damage caused because of keeping schools closed for a long duration is unimaginable. Students need at least 2-3 months of bridge course to reach a level where they can at least understand their current year’s syllabus,” P Shanker Goud, a government teacher working in a school in Sircilla, said. He said that they can’t even force students to attend schools regularly as many were continuing to work part-time to support their families. “I see students leaving school after mid-day meals. When questioned, they said that they have to work,” he added. Seconding with Goud, M Ravindar, who teaches mathematics for class 10 students, said that he was teaching multiplication and division to students now as they were unable to solve simple problems. They said that they were now gearing up for damage control so that students, especially those in class 10, would be ready to appear for their board exams in 2022. “We are starting with basics now as many concepts in class 10 have links in previous classes,” said Suvarna M, a government teacher from Zaheerabad. Those from private budget schools too shared the same sentiment as they said that students who did not attend online classes have forgotten everything. The situation of primary and upper primary students is said to be even worse.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/students-grappling-with-basics-teachers-with-overshooting-deadlines/articleshow/86353335.cms||Nirupa Vatyam

Lalbazar treated this weekend as a dress rehearsal for the bigger pujas next month. In a first, cops at the ghats on Saturday and Sunday were asked to act tough against anyone who arrived late for Vishwakarma immersions, flouting night restrictions. “We had been asked to note down the name of the organisers and the route they took. We are asking local cops to start legal action against such organizers on a case-to-case basis. We want to reiterate there is no permission for any immersion once the night restrictions set in from 11pm,” said a Port division officer. During immersions, all roads with high idol movement were barricaded and dedicated lanes were created for trucks in the evening.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/immersion-rule-violators-face-cop-action/articleshow/86351206.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

The man, whose identity was not revealed by the ATS, was nabbed from Mumbra town in neighbouring Thane district on Saturday night after information received about him from Zakir Hussain Shaikh (45), an accused who was arrested by the ATS from Jogeshwari in Mumbai on Friday, he said.  Based on information revealed by Shaikh, the state ATS conducted multiple raids and nabbed the man from Mumbra, the official said, adding that they were probing his role into the terror module. Delhi Police’s Special Cell on Tuesday busted a terror module with the arrest of six men, including two terrorists trained by Pakistan's intelligence agency ISI.

The Indian Red Cross Society (IRCS) is all set to create groups of blood donors on WhatsApp in parts of the state for the benefit of those in a medical emergency. Speaking to TOI, state coordinator, Blood Banks and Projects IRCS, BVS Kumar said the hh blood group was identified in 1952 in Bombay, hence the name. This group does not express the H antigen and can donate to any blood group but receive blood only from a donor of the Bombay blood group. Genetically passed on, just 0.0004% of the population has the Bombay blood group. The Red Cross wishes to maintain an exclusive WhatsApp group of all Bombay blood group donors in the state, Kumar added. In Krishna district, the IRCS has found only five donors with the rare Bombay blood group. “The idea is to create a WhatsApp group of blood donors of specific groups, with a capacity for 256 members, so one group for each blood group means 256 donors can get a message during emergencies. The group eliminates the challenge of tracing blood donors of a specific blood group and making multiple calls in emergencies,” IRCS officials added .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/soon-rare-blood-group-donors-will-be-just-a-message-away/articleshow/86351218.cms||Nalla.Babu

Additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav tried to persuade her so that the accused, Deepak, could be given an opportunity to reform himself, but she persisted and sought to withdraw her surety. “She requests the court to take him into custody as she will not be able to continue as his surety. This court has tried to persuade his surety to remain surety so that the accused could be given an opportunity to reform himself. However, the surety persists and she seeks to withdraw her surety. The accused submits that he is not in a position to engage any other surety. He is, accordingly, taken into custody,” the court said in the order. After perusing the entire judicial and police files, the court noted that the police file has been maintained in a shabby manner. “Some questions were asked from SHO, police station Gokulpuri, and the IO, who had no answer. Since the special public prosecutor is not available today, the queries of the court are reserved for the next date of hearing,” it said. A surety is a person who comes to the court when an accused is enlarged on bail and gives undertaking that he/she will ensure the appearance of the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/riot-accused-out-on-bail-sent-back-to-jail-as-mother-refuses-surety/articleshow/86353386.cms||---

Rom-coms use Jane Austen’s template now’||Sometimes the idea for a book can come from a stranger on the street or a painting one acquires, points out author Deborah Moggach. But the idea for her 2004 book These Foolish Things, which would later be adapted into the movie The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, came from a question, she told author Jaishree Misra at the Times LitFest.  “What’s going to happen to us all when we get older, because there is not going to be enough money to take care of us because we live so long? I decided to outsource the elderly to lovely India which is so cheap, warm, welcoming and respectful of the elderly. It’s a great deal better than they are treated in England,” says Moggach. Moggach, whose new book is a page-turner called Black Dress, was also the screenwriter behind the 2005 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. She credits the realism of the movie for its success. “Plus, Austen understood that the basis of romance is friction and denial. It is the template for rom-coms now,” she says.  Her experiences with film adaptations have been mixed – her book Tulip Fever was adapted into a movie that never hit the screens because it was produced by Harvey Weinstein and was released just as the accusations against him came out. She also revealed that The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel will now be adapted into a stage play in London. “You’re the first person I’ve told, it just happened,” she told Misra. “We’re looking for a cast and will hopefully tour it next year.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/basis-of-romance-is-friction-and-denial-rom-coms-use-jane-austens-template-now/articleshow/86353391.cms||---

Senior health officials said 30 dengue cases have been reported in the Cantonment between July first week and September third week. A majority of the cases are reported from Mahendra Hills, Bowenpally and Rasoolpura, while Picket and Bolaram are accounting for fresh dengue cases. This has left Cantonment board’s health and sanitation officials worried. Staff of Telangana medical and health department swung into action and surveyed the areas, enquiring about the dengue cases. In Rasoolpura, 40 per cent of residents are locals, while another 40 per cent are migrants. Ch Narasimha, malaria sub-unit officer, told TOI that dengue cases were steadily rising in Cantonment. “A large number of cases are being noticed in densely-populated areas like slums and people residing along the nalas. We have alerted the SCB health and sanitation wing to take up sanitation on a war-footing,” he said. Health workers are visiting the affected areas and explaining measures to be followed to prevent mosquito breeding by maintaining proper sanitation. “Our teams are taking up fogging and anti-larval spraying,” said a senior SCB official. Anti-larval operations were taken up at Ramannakunta lake and Trimulgherry lake. The official said residents were given health tips on how to prevent spread of dengue. “Dengue cases could be more as a majority of the residents are approaching corporate hospitals and taking treatment there,” a health official said. Since dengue patients are not treated at Cantonment urban health centres, people are heading to corporate hospitals for treatment, officials said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/spurt-in-dengue-cases-in-cantt-anti-larval-operations-taken-up/articleshow/86353374.cms||Sunil Mungara

The government has recently set two vaccine records. On Saturday, health officials administered 5.27 lakh single doses. On Friday, the health department had met its highest target of four lakh doses (two lakh being first doses and the remaining second doses). Officials were working hard to enhance immunisation coverage in rural areas. The drive involves everyone from health staff to people’s representatives. So far, 2.16 crore jabs have been administered in the state, with 1.56 crore being initial doses and 59 lakh being second doses.However, the number of women receiving the jabs in the state is slightly lower than the number of males. So far, 1.11 crore men had received vaccine shots, while 1.04 crore women were given jabs. Health issues, according to officials, were to blame. “This number disparity is more noticeable in rural regions unlike urban areas. The reasons range from pregnancy problems to a lack of awareness about receiving the vaccination jab,” top officials said. In the rural areas, local youth were being engaged to spread awareness about the vaccine. Door-to-door service is also being provided in rural areas, thanks to the success of the model in Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) area. According to officials, the number of second doses would increase in the next few days as more people were scheduled for their jabs. “The vaccine supply has improved, and we are also attempting to acquire directly from companies. By December-end, at least one dose will be distributed to all eligible population of the state,” officials stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-to-administer-3l-doses-a-day/articleshow/86353354.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Wish list makes admissions faster, but colleges still worried about fair seat assignment||KOLKATA: With just 10 days left for UG admissions to close, several colleges fear genuine aspirants may miss out on berths due to seats being blocked by those who have chosen to study in specific colleges without conveying their decisions to the others. While a wish-list system that asked students to choose a course in a college has made admissions faster, principals said it hasn’t been able to solve the problem since candidates have been opting for courses in multiple colleges without opting out of any. This year, a huge number of applications were submitted, but admission has been slow. However, it has picked up speed over the last few days. Subhasis Dutta, principal of Maulana Azad College, said, “Seats are filling faster now and cancellations are happening. But we are still worried about selecting the deserving students according to the vacancies.” Principal of Scottish Church College Madhumanjari Mandal said the process is going well now and a wish list has been published after the third round of admissions. “Less than 300 seats are vacant now, but the high-demand subjects are almost full,” she said. Others felt the wish-list system was not fool-proof as there was no specific rule of assigning seats to ensure all candidates get a fair chance. “General seats are filling up and the honours subjects are almost full, but cancellations are being made as well,” said Jogamaya Devi College principal Sarbani Sarkar.Presidency University has completed the second round of admission. “The admission process is smooth and will be completed within the time notified by the state,” said registrar Debajyoti Konar. Another college principal said it was too early to say if all seats across colleges would be taken. Officials felt students are focused on a few colleges and subjects which have got a lot of applications while the rest have failed to attract many students. “But the seat count includes subjects that are not popular,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/wish-list-makes-admissions-faster-but-colleges-still-worried-about-fair-seat-assignment/articleshow/86351238.cms||---
---||Delhi||This bestselling author thinks in Kannada, writes in English||Besides being a philanthropist and chairperson of the Infosys Foundation, Sudha Murty has carved a place for herself as one of the most popular children’s authors in India. Murty attributes the popularity of her books to their simplicity and relatability. “I write in a very simple way with a small vocabulary and most Indians who study in their mother tongue have that kind of English language,” she says.  “It’s not that only my life has these experiences, but I note down everything, which is the secret of my success,” Murty told Shobha Tharoor Srinivasan at the Times Literature Festival. Talking about her writing process, Murty said she prefers to write early in the morning before going to work and then revisits it in the evening. “It is like boiling milk on a fire. When it starts boiling it comes out of the vessel. The moment the story is ready, it pushes me to write.” She added that for her, writing was often like watching a movie play out in her mind. “The scenes and conversations come in front of me, frame by frame, including details like the colour of saris,” she said. The septuagenarian revealed that she started writing in English only after her 50th birthday. “For the first 50 years of my life I wrote in Kannada,” she said. “I believe age is no bar to learning; this is something that my grandmother taught me.” Even today, she says she thinks in Kannada when writing novels “because the emotions come to me in Kannada”. Murty’s own love for reading began early. “I grew up in a village with no electricity and radio in those days, so the only entertainment was reading books,” she recalls. Her advice for aspiring writers? “Writing is like weaving a cloth – imagination is one thread and reality is another. When the book is finished, the reader won’t be able to distinguish what is imagination and what is reality.” Murty believes that writers can’t be overly sensitive. “Sensitivity is the essential core of a writer but if you are extremely sensitive, then when someone says negative things about you, you get so perturbed that you can’t function. Over time, I have developed thick skin but retained sensitivity so I can write.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/this-bestselling-author-thinks-in-kannada-writes-in-english/articleshow/86353450.cms||---

Many candidates arrived from the neighbouring states, like Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha, two to three days in advance as the centre in Ballygunge was the only venue for the admission test in eastern India. Most of the students who took the test were between the ages of 10 and 11 — for Class VI — and between the ages of 13 and 14 — Class XI. It was mandatory for all students to wear N95 masks and carry sanitiser. Their body temperatures were checked at the entrance of the examination centre. Schools and colleges have been shut since March 2020 and have been conducting online examinations. Last week, the NEET, and the joint entrance examinations in July were also conducted in the pen-and-paper mode. “We arrived on Saturday afternoon for the test since this is the only centre for the whole of eastern India,” said Dheeraj Kumar from Bihar Sharif whose son Sourav, 10, appeared for the test. The two-hour-long examination started at 9am, but the examinees were taken inside the centre at 7.30am. “We had to check their temperature and direct them to their rooms and seats. It was started early so that everything could be done keeping social distancing in mind,” said an official at the examination centre. While the children took the test inside, parents waited on the pavements outside. Many who were tired from travelling even dozed off on newspapers. There are five RMSs throughout the country with two in Karnataka, two in Rajasthan and one in Himachal Pradesh. Common Entrance Test is conducted once a year in centres in different parts of the country. “These are fully residential schools affiliated to CBSE. Many parents want their children to study here because the focus on extra-curricular activities is as much as on academic activities. The institution prepares a solid foundation and prepares students for defence-related exams and courses,” an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kids-take-first-pen-paper-test-in-kol-since-march-2020/articleshow/86351279.cms||Zeeshan Javed

The accused cheated people of Rs 50 lakh in different cities. The app, Star Maker, lets budding singers live stream their broadcast. Gifts from users can be redeemed for money. On September 7, the accused, Mahavir Prasad Sharma, duped a 50-year-old of Rs 21 lakh, police said. A case was registered at Shalimar Bagh police station. Two other cases were reported in Rishikesh and Firozpur where people were cheated of Rs 24 lakh and Rs 8.5 lakh respectively. “The team worked relentlessly on the case and got details of the account in which the cheated amount was transferred, It was noticed that the amount was first transferred to an account of a private bank and to different accounts later. So, it became difficult to identify the exact culprit,” said Usha Rangnani, DCP, North West. She added, “Persistent interrogation and efforts by the team led to identification of accused. Immediately, a raiding team was formed and sent to Shillong, Meghalaya. Based on technical surveillance and with the help of local police, raids were conducted at several locations in Shillong. The cyber team of North West was able to apprehend the accused, who was in hiding”. Sharma is a well-educated person who works as senior manager in a cement company in Shillong. His wife and two sons are well-settled in Kolkata. He started cheating people on the app for easy money. “In the beginning, he gave users some gifts for live streaming on the app and became their friend. He then exchanged numbers with them. Later, after getting money from the singers for increasing their profile ratings, he switched off his phone,” said Rangnani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/man-held-for-cheating-budding-artistes-over-ratings-on-singing-app/articleshow/86354639.cms||---

As per communication from the ministry of home affairs to additional chief secretary (home and vigilance) T K Jose, the state has 112 persons possessing more than two firearms. The government had amended the Arms Act, 1959, to restrict the number of firearms that can be possessed by an individual to two. As per the Arms (Amendment) Act, 2019, “A person who has in his possession more firearms than two at the commencement of the Arms (Amendment) Act, 2019, may retain with him any two of such firearms and shall deposit, within one year from such commencement, the remaining firearm with the officer in charge of the nearest police station.” They can also deposit them with a licenced dealer or, where such person is a member of the armed forces of the Union, in a unit armoury. After depositing them, it will be delicensed within 90 days from the date of expiry of one year of amendment. “Since holding three arms is not permitted as per law, you are requested to expeditiously ensure necessary action for the deposit of the third arm by such licensees and endorsement of the same on their licenses,” the MHA’s letter said. Even though the state has only 112 citizens who possess three firearms, several states, especially in the north, have a large number of such licensees holding three firearms. Among the states, Punjab (6,973), Uttar Pradesh (3,945), Haryana (2,524), Madhya Pradesh (1,010), Rajasthan (973) and Delhi (927) have the highest number of such licensees. At the same time, among the southern states, Karnataka (529) has the highest number. Though the amendment had limited the number of firearms to two, it has also been clarified that no licence is required for acquisition or possession of small arms falling under the category of “curio”, which has been defined as a small arm manufactured at least 50 years prior to the current date or certified by the curator of a government-regulated museum or that derives at least half of its monetary value from the fact that it is novel, rare, bizarre, or associated with some historical figure, period, or event. However, appropriate licence as prescribed would be required for use or to carry or transport such small arms. Also, without the endorsement of such firearms in the prescribed licence of the owner, no ammunition shall be sold for their use. Issuing the licence for regular firearms itself is a tough task, as a favourable report from the district police chief and tahsildar are required for granting the licence, which is given only after a security assessment. If the applicant is residing near the forest area, a favourable report from the DFO is also required. Also, the firearms should be surrendered at the nearest police station once elections are declared.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/ensure-limit-of-firearms-held-by-individuals-to-two-centre/articleshow/86351564.cms||KP Saikiran

Steering the ambitious drive to expand the country's road infrastructure for the past seven years, a confident Gadkari also asserted that National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) will rake in annual toll income to the tune of Rs 1.4 lakh crore in the next five years from the current level of Rs 40,000 crore. Gadkari, who just completed a whirlwind tour to assess the progress of the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway that will pass through four states apart from the national capital, said the national highways infrastructure is a world-class success story. “Once the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway is completed and opened for the public, we will get at least Rs 1,000-1,500 crore as toll revenues every month,” he said. The Delhi-Mumbai Expressway is likely to be completed by March 2023 and is being built as part of the first phase of the ‘Bharatmala Pariyojana’. The eight-lane expressway, covering Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat, is expected to halve the commute time between the national capital and the country’s financial hub from nearly 24 hours to 12 hours. Against the backdrop of concerns being flagged about NHAI being saddled with high level of debt, the Union road transport and highways minister pointed out that the nodal agency has received ‘AAA’ rating and all its road projects are productive.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-mum-e-way-to-fetch-centre-rs-1000cr-every-month-gadkari/articleshow/86354659.cms||---

On Sunday, the state agriculture department director, Nisha Oraon Singhmar, said the state government has already given its in-principle approval to their ambitious project and will start floating tenders soon. “We hope to start floating the tenders by October-end. We are in the process of zeroing in on a plot and if things according to plan, the almost Rs 10-crore-park should start taking shape by this year-end,” Nisha said. The park will be a one-stop destination for those doing research in herbal plants and it’ll help in promoting a range of organic and scientific planning among farmers. “It’s fairly a new concept and such parks don’t exist in many places except in few states like Haryana and Uttarakhand,” she said. The government aims to sensitise people regarding herbal farmers through this pilot project in order to generate employment as well as encourage investments in this sector. “Besides being a place of recreation, we aim to develop this park as a place of research and academics among the students of herbal medicine. The farmers will also get an exposure to the latest trends and techniques of herbal cultivation, their uses and market demand,” Nisha said. She added that it will also help the state in developing nature-based herbal tourism centres in Jharkhand for promotion of sustainable livelihood in the herbal sector and opportunities for the herbal processing industry in the region. Another official added that in the initial phase of its establishment, efforts will be made to preserve the herbal plant wealth of the state and later, important exotic and rare herbal plants will be nurtured in the park. Citing the key features of the park, the official added, “The park will consist of an aromatic herb garden, a spice herb garden, kitchen herb garden, ornamental herb harden, cosmetic herb garden, along with the facilities for irrigation network and micro-irrigation system, post-harvest herb processing, a herb oil extraction unit and distillation, candy-making unit, herbal shampoo and soap-making units, among others.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/agri-dept-to-set-up-states-1st-herbal-park-in-dumka-dist/articleshow/86350569.cms||ASRP Mukesh

---||Ranchi||Humiliation faced at young age can leave lifelong scar, warn mental health experts||RANCHI: Twelve-year-old Shifa prefers to keep her camera off and microphone on mute during her online class. Even after repeated warnings by her teachers and her parents, she has refused to mend her ways and has even threatened to skip meals if she is probed further on the matter. Fourteen-year-old Arushi (name changed), a diligent student until two years ago, lost interest in her studies and started performing poorly in her online exams. Her parents initially blamed it on sheer laziness but when they saw that she is losing interest in almost everything that she enjoyed doing they decided to consult a child psychologist. Although to a layman this may seem like the child is overreacting over a trivial issue or is simply seeking attention, experts pointed out that such behaviours are common if a child feels humiliated. Dr Madhumita Bhattacharya, assistant professor of clinical psychology at Central Institute of Psychiatry (CIP), said, “I recently dealt with a child who felt neglected in her online class because the teacher did not ask her to answer a question that the latter had asked all the students. Although it is not always possible for a teacher to individually deal with every student when teaching a class of 50+ pupils, the child who feels neglected may turn averse to attending the classes.” She warned that humiliation faced at a young age leaves a lifelong scar. “Unlike physical scars, these scars remain invisible and unless handled carefully, they can be a cause for concern,” she said. The associate professor of psychiatry at CIP, Dr Nishant Goyal, said that of the 75% patients arriving in OPD have a history of humiliation and the percentage is even more in case of adolescents. When asked why kids are taking offence for seemingly minor things, Dr Goyal said, “Today’s kids are more aware of their rights but the awareness about their responsibilities is very low. Earlier, kids hardly took offence on being scolded by their teachers. In today’s day and age, if a child feels neglected, it can interfere with his/her growth.” As a coping mechanism, Dr Bhattacharya said parents need to be watchful and engage their children in activities that help them become organized. “Give them domestic work like sorting out utensils or arranging their cupboards and books. Praying also helps in de-stressing, just as taking up any sport does,” she added. Fr. Joseph Marianus Kujur, who is the director of Xavier Institute of Social Service, feels that humiliation-triggered problems are not confined to adolescents alone. “Humiliation impacts the performance of working professionals as well and those insulting others are aware of the negative impact of their words on others. This attitude needs to change,” he said. Fulbright scholar and director of the Centre of Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences Dr Anant Kumar believes that one of the most vital ways of dealing with humiliation is to talk about it. “We tend to hide, may be out of fear of further humiliation, but there has to be a platform where everyone is open to discuss. As a society, we must try to stop this poisonous culture where people in powerful positions assert their authority by demeaning their subordinates and this applies to a teacher-student relationship as well,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/humiliation-faced-at-young-age-can-leave-lifelong-scar-warn-mental-health-experts/articleshow/86350714.cms||---

---||India||NHAI holds up Rs 20L dues for 9 yrs, coughs up Rs 4.5cr||NEW DELHI: In a classic case that substantiates how red tape can result in government entities paying a big price at a later stage, the NHAI ended up releasing nearly Rs 4.5 crore to a private firm for holding back the clearing of bills of barely Rs 20 lakh, eight to nine years back. The National Highways Authority of India made the final payment in December 2019, according to documents accessed by TOI, after the private firm won the arbitration award and also two cases in the Delhi high court. The NHAI had to pay this large amount due to the high interest rate. The firm was entitled to get 27% interest since it was registered under the MSME Development Act of 2006. Responding to a query from TOI, Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari said, "We will investigate the matter." Court documents show that the private firm had signed an agreement with the NHAI in February 2010 to oversee the toll collection at 11 toll plazas. The NHAI had submitted that the firm had failed to carry out continuous observations of the assignments given to it and there was a delay on their part in furnishing the reports. It had also said the payment was delayed as the reports were submitted late. However, finally the NHAI cleared invoices of Rs 20 lakh. The private firm then took the matter to the MSME Facilitation Council citing delay in clearing of bills. The private firm had registered itself under the MSME Development Act in February 2011. After the conciliation proceedings failed, the MSME Council referred the case to the Delhi International Arbitration Centre. In June 2018, the institutional arbitrator passed an award of Rs 2.24 crore along with interest at the rate of 27% per annum at monthly rest in favour of the private firm, commencing from July 2016. The matter then reached the Delhi HC as the private firm sought execution of the arbitration award. The HC upheld the arbitration award and in May 2019, it directed the NHAI to pay Rs 4.18 crore to the private firm as on November 20, 2018. The NHAI made the payment of Rs 3.79 crore in July 2019. Later, the private player again raised the demand for Rs 83.78 lakh as additional interest on the original award amount of Rs 2.24 crore for the period between November 2018 (the day it filed the petition in the HC) and July 2019 (the day NHAI made the payment). As the HC issued directions to the NHAI to make the additional payment, the authority sought legal opinion. According to an official document of November 2019, the legal adviser "advised the NHAI to pay the amount" within time "to avoid further interest".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/nhai-holds-up-rs-20l-dues-for-9-yrs-coughs-up-rs-4-5cr/articleshow/86355896.cms||Dipak K Dash

Ever since Kejriwal announced free electricity for Goemkars, BJP has been on its toes and finding new things to copy from the Kejriwal model and announce it, he said. Sawant had earlier copied Kejriwal’s free water policy, he said. “I would like to tell Sawant that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, I want to ask him, however, where was this plan for the last 4 years?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/glad-sawant-is-copying-kejriwal/articleshow/86353683.cms||---

---||Goa||As tarballs continue to plague coast, experts push for source identification||PANAJI: More than a week after a massive influx of tar balls splattered Goa’s coastline, the sticky matter continues to wash ashore in some stretches. Scientists are viewing the prolonged deposition with alarm and suggesting identification of the source. “Eyewitness reports reveal that it has been a continuous process for nearly two weeks. This could be an alarming situation and merits quantification of tarballs that reach here during a particular episode. Beyond a certain limit, the huge tarball quantity indicates that oil is being discarded from a particular place or a huge quantity of oil is being released from multiple sites, all at the same time,” former NIO scientist Antonio Mascarenhas said. In the past, research has helped identify Bombay high oil fields and passing vessels as sources of the menace. “Tarball formation could be from multiple sources, though the major ones contributing to it could be off shore washing of tankers and cargo ships and also offshore oil installations. Finger printing technology can certainly identify the source,” Baban Ingole a former NIO scientist said. On Saturday, the Mandrem, Candolim-Sinquerim and Majorda beaches were littered with more tarballs, though in smaller quantities. As staff of the Karnataka Commercial and Industrial Corporation Pvt Ltd (KCIC), the beach cleaning agency, struggle to clear beach stretches of the hazardous material, more keeps surfacing. In one of the worst tarball episodes, KCIC staff has nearly cleaned up all the affected beaches, collecting it in 1,641 bags. “Our staff has worked continuously to remove the tarballs but more keep coming and being hazardous material they need to be handled with caution,” regional head, KCIC, Parveen Farooqui said. A government source said the chief minister, environment minister, various departments are trying to tackle the matter. “Samples have been taken for chemical analysis,” the source said, but declined to comment further. Conceding that the culprits behind the pollution should be dealt with firmly, the source said, “The central government is being approached for action in the matter,” he said. “The tarball menace is an international issue since components may originate in international waters and marine chemists, microbiologists and coastal managers should be engaged towards its management,” Mascarenhas said. The continuous pollution for over a week has also worried the tourism industry. “Every tide brings in some tar. During the first two days, even before cleaning could start in full swing, some deposits melted and seeped into the sand,” a tourism stakeholder John Lobo said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/as-tarballs-continue-to-plague-coast-experts-push-for-source-identification/articleshow/86353842.cms||Paul Fernandes

A majority of middle class households, even a section of senior citizens, have adopted various e-commerce platforms for the delivery of essentials such as groceries, medicines and other emergency services at their doorsteps. “We have scaled up our engagement with e-commerce platforms for more business avenues during the pandemic,” said Himanshu Bakshi, MD, Danone India, a leading food and beverage company. Witnessing the big boost, most of the e-tailers are expanding their logistics and warehouse infrastructure in the east. “Flipkart has opened a 2.4 lakh sq ft fulfilment centre in Kolkata. We are getting about 30% orders from the eastern part of India. We have tied up with a third-party agency to meet the demand for the last mile delivery,” said Raghav Sood, co-founder of Skin Elements, a leading brand in personal care. Together with thousands of small and medium business and brand partners, Amazon India is aiming at the fastest delivery in the east. “Many customers believe that online shopping is safe during the pandemic and this is reflecting in our recent events like Prime Day 2021, Great Freedom Festival, Rakhi store, Onam store etc,” said a spokesperson of Amazon. Like other sectors, lockdown and restrictions have also boosted online education sector. Sachin Sardana, co-founder and COO of Dhurina, an ed-tech firm, said, “Teaching methods had to undergo an immense transformation. E-learning is providing solutions to students and generating business for online education players.” Small retail and kirana shops have started selling goods with home delivery on WhatsApp and accepting payments through UPI apps like GPay, PhonePe and others, said Sunit Kumar Nandi, founder of Letter, India’s privacy-first email provider.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/buoyed-by-pandemic-push-e-tailers-eye-east/articleshow/86351988.cms||Sarthak.G
---||Goa||South Goa: At Curtorim farmer’s market, local flavours and arts set the tone||MARGAO: Tastes and flavours from the farms and hearths of farmers of Curtorim permeated ‘Curtorcho Maand’, a farmers’ market, that was organised at Curtorim on Sunday. The initiative was an endeavour aimed at providing local farmers hit by the pandemic, a platform to offer their produce — local, farm fresh, cooked delicacies, bakery treats, masalas, homemade wines and other homemade arts and crafts. The turnout for the market, the organisers claimed, was “overwhelming”. Traditional delicacies like sorportel, sausage bread, sannas, beef samosas et al were sold alongside more contemporary delicacies like pork steamed buns, biryani, chicken lollipop and ribbon sandwiches. Besides, there were delicacies to cater to every sweet tooth — doughnuts, jam tarts, muffins, eclairs, bebinca, dodol, doce as well as a range of pickles, vinegar and other condiments. Stalls with baby clothes, beautiful handmade crochet household items, intricate wood carvings and wooden household implements were among those which drew a large number of patrons. The cynosure of eyes at the maand was the creative works of a 13-year-old girl from Curtorim. Her paintings, which resemble the traditional azulejos, drew much appreciation from the crowds. The market also had a stall with local ‘gavti’ hens, chickens and ducks, which did rapid business. Stalls selling vermicompost, mushroom growing kits, and nursery plants also did brisk sales. The biodiversity management committee of the village had a stall selling heritage rice grown in Curtorim as well as other medicinal fruits and local juices. Musical band Amigoes playing many popular songs lent a festive touch to the event. Explaining the objective of holding the farmers’ market, a member of the organising team said, “Curtorim is also known for its food and its caterers as a vast majority of people here are engaged in food catering. With all entertainment events coming to a standstill, there is an economic crunch and many people have not had the opportunity to earn for several months. Many have lost jobs. The maand provided a platform for the locals to showcase their talents and also to inculcate the importance of local produce.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/at-curtorim-farmers-market-local-flavours-and-arts-set-the-tone/articleshow/86353932.cms||---

After lifeguards at Palolem informed forest department at Pissonem range, forest guards Manjunath Kalangutkar and Datta Velip rushed to the beach and took possession of the green turtle, which is rarely seen on state coastline. Pissonem range forest officer Devidas Velip said, the turtle sustained injuries to one of its flippers. The veterinary officer at Canacona, Dr Anisha Pinheiro, was called to treat the injured reptile. After receiving a dose of antibiotics and some care to ensure it had recovered from its exhaustion, the turtle was handed over to the forest staff. The entrapped flippered creature weighed around 150kg. It is learnt that such turtle species are mostly found in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Some sources said they are herbivores and mostly feed on sea grasses and algae. Being rare, the green turtle piqued the curiosity of wildlife enthusiasts present at the spot during its rescue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/rare-green-sea-turtle-trapped-in-fishing-net-rescued-released-into-sea/articleshow/86353987.cms||---

A new fish-and-vegetable market on the land where the existing fish market stands, a new commercial complex on the land where the existing municipal building stands, Ravindra Bhavan annexe, and a new sports complex, are some of the works which have been grounded. AAP’s in-charge for Curchorem assembly constituency, Gabriel Fernandes, speaking to reporters, was scathing in his attack on Curchorem MLA Nilesh Cabral for his failure to get the projects completed in time. Pointing out that work on the sports complex has been abandoned by the contractor owing to issues concerning payment of his bills, Fernandes criticised the government for “mismanagement of public money” leading to wasteful expenditure. “The foundation stone for the sports complex was laid on December 10, 2016, and the actual work had commenced in 2017. The project estimated to cost Rs 55 crore was scheduled to be completed within two years. However, over four years later, the project lies stalled. As regards the other projects, work hasn’t even started,” Fernandes said. An indoor swimming pool, a community hall, and a jogging track are proposed to be housed in the sports complex. The work is being executed by Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation (GSIDC). “Work of about 20 crore was completed but the contractor abandoned the work midway as he received only half the amount of the bills that were raised. Being the local MLA, it was Cabral’s job to ensure that the project sees the light of the day within the designated timeline. This only shows that sports is not the priority for Cabral,” Fernandes said. Acknowledging the delay in completion of the projects, Cabral has attributed it largely to the “financial crunch” faced by the government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/aap-flays-cabral-for-incomplete-infra/articleshow/86354047.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

EDITED Times News Network Panaji: Chief minister Pramod Sawant has pulled up United Telecoms Limited (UTL), the private agency that has implemented the Goa Broad Band Network (GBBN), for poor internet connectivity at panchayats and urban local bodies. Sawant had demanded that necessary steps should be taken to “fix the issues” and to ensure uninterrupted internet connectivity at the 191 panchayats and 14 municipalities in the state. Officials said the missive from the chief minister’s office ensured that internet connectivity was much better when Prime Minister Narendra Modi interacted with Covid-19 warriors, vaccination staff, medical workers and panchayat functionaries. After a meeting with Swayampurna Mitras on August 7, Sawant had shot off a letter to the department of information and technology (DoIT) on August 10 red-flagging internet connectivity. “Necessary steps may be taken at the earliest to find out the reasons behind the poor quality of GBBN internet connectivity, fix the issues and ensure that all 191 Panchayats and 14 municipalities are equipped with uninterrupted high speed broadband connection with power backup within 15 days,” Sawant said in his note to DoIT. Interestingly, DoIT conveyed the directive to UTL on September 1. Director for Information and technology sought a bandwidth utilisation usage report from UTL and also asked the private company to improve the power back up at each village panchayat and municipality. “It is requested to provide bandwidth utilization usage report along with power backup status at each village panchayat and municipalities for GBBN connectivity,” said Director for IT Ankita Anand in her note to UTL. In 2006, the state government awarded a contract to UTL to connect all the district headquarters with all 11 Talukas, village panchayats, educational institutions, 225 government offices and urban local bodies with high speed optic fibre cable link. The state government has already decided to exit GBBN as all the equipment installed and deployed by UTL are at “end of life, end of warranty” and thus in need of complete replacement. Government sources said that UTL has not invested in fresh infrastructure to improve IT connectivity in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/govt-hauls-up-utl-for-poor-internet-connectivity-to-pyats-civic-bodies/articleshow/86354150.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||India||At 29%, Delhi posts India’s most civilian injuries in cop action||NEW DELHI: Among all states and Union territories, Delhi recorded the highest number of civilian injuries in 2020 due to police actions. As many as 65 of the 67 people injured in police operations here last year - an eight-fold rise over 2019 - had faced lathi-charge by cops, according to the latest crime data published by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). According to the data, as many as 76 police personnel in Delhi were injured on duty, including 45 while dealing with riotous mobs. Though the NCRB data does not give details on the timing of the police actions that injured both civilians and men in khaki, it is possible that many of these coincided with the anti-CAA riots witnessed in parts of the national Capital in early 2020. Civilians injured in police operations across Delhi constituted over 29% of the all-India figure of 226. In J&K, a hub of civilian protests in the past, 43 people were injured in police operations last year, just about one-fifth of the 201 hurt in 2019. The all-India count of police personnel killed on duty during 2020 was 24% higher than in 2019, even though the number of injured personnel fell by the same margin. Of the total 526 fatal casualties suffered by all uniformed police personnel last year, 372 or 70% were on account of accidents, 59 were caused by Left-wing extremists, 36 by jihadi terrorists, 21 each by riotous mobs and criminals, nine due to border firing and eight by accidents involving self-weapon. Also, 1,506 police personnel were injured last year, of which more than one-third had been attacked by riotous mobs. Another 474 police personnel were injured by criminals, gangsters and dacoits, 311 in accidents, 88 by Maoists, 61 by jihadi terrorists, 20 in accidents due to self-weapon and eight in border firing. In 2019, 424 police personnel were killed and 1997 injured on duty, including 980 by riotous mobs. As per NCRB report, civilians killed and injured in police operations went down by 33% and 44% respectively, as compared to 2019. Civilian fatalities fell from 71 in 2019 to 47 in 2020, of which 23 were in J&K alone, and civilians injured in police operations dipped more sharply from 406 to 226. Civilian fatalities in police operations in J&K too fell to 23 from 33 in 2019. The number of police fatalities in the newly-created UT however rose to 52 in 2020 from 16 in 2019, even though a lesser 137 police personnel were injured as compared to 247 in 2019. Of the 526 police personnel killed in the country, more than 50% were constables and 23%, head-constables. Others killed on duty in 2020 included 52 assistant sub-inspectors, 40 sub-inspector, 5 Inspectors and 6 gazetted officers. Among the states, Chhattisgarh recorded the highest police casualties last year at 78, possibly on account of the Maoist attack in April in which 22 personnel were killed; followed by Tamil Nadu (60, of which 55 died in accidents); and UP and J&K that lost 52 police personnel each. Most police personnel were injured in Kerala (176), followed by Rajasthan (162), Karnataka (144) and J&K (137).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/at-29-delhi-posts-indias-most-civilian-injuries-in-cop-action/articleshow/86355973.cms||Bharti Jain

---||Goa||Mineral corp to check iron ore at 77 mining leases||PANAJI: The state government has provided documents of 77 mining leases to the Mineral Exploration Corporation Ltd (MECL) for identifying the quantity of iron ore lying in these mines before they are auctioned. The MECL will check the documents of the leases which are spread across the state. “Once it verifies the records, its officials will shortlist the mining leases and visit the sites next month for exploration and identifying the quantity of iron ore available at each lease,” a senior officer said. The senior officer said that the MECL will check who is holding the surface rights of the leases — whether it is the government or a private party. It will also check mining plans. The state government had signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the MECL in July to identify new iron ore mines in the state. Keeping in mind the delay in resumption of mining activities in the state, chief minister Pramod Sawant had decided to form a mining corporation and identify new mineral blocks to restart the industry. The senior officer had said that once the MECL finalises the blocks to be auctioned, the leases will be transferred to the mining corporation and thereafter it will be auctioned. Mining in Goa came to a halt in March 2018 following the decision of the Supreme Court to quash the second renewal of 88 mining leases. During the Portuguese era, Goa had 806 mining concessions; and in 1987, after the concessions were abolished and converted into leases, the number had reduced to 595 leases. Goa has large deposits of iron ore (1,456 million tonne) as well as significant occurrences of other major minerals like bauxite (55 million tonne) and manganese ore (34 million tonne).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/mineral-corp-to-check-iron-ore-at-77-mining-leases/articleshow/86354337.cms||Murari Shetye
---||India||BJP: Why is Cong ‘silent’ over Captain’s charges against Sidhu?||NEW DELHI: Senior BJP leader Prakash Javadekar on Sunday questioned the Congress leadership's "silence" over the serious allegations made by former Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh against state Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu. Singh had alleged that Sidhu is friends with Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan and Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa and is a "security risk" as Punjab is a border state. Javadekar said Amarinder Singh has made very serious allegations against Sidhu, calling him anti-national, "so why are Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi silent?" He termed Singh's charges "extremely serious" and asked why Congress president Sonia Gandhi and its two other main leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra have kept silent. "Such an extremely serious allegation has been levelled by the chief minister against the party president, and the Congress is silent. What does it mean? We demand that Congress should speak up and make its stand clear," he told reporters at his residence. "We want to ask if the Congress will take cognizance of such extremely serious allegations and take action," Javadekar added. Hours after quitting as Punjab chief minister, Singh had on Saturday launched a no-holds-barred attack against Sidhu, calling him "anti-national", "dangerous" and a "total disaster". He had mentioned Sidhu's praise for Imran Khan and him hugging Bajwa during a trip to Pakistan to slam his bete noire. Javadekar said the country had seen this and had been grappling with this issue as Pakistan has been sponsoring terror in India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bjp-why-is-cong-silent-over-captains-charges-against-sidhu/articleshow/86356028.cms||---

Motorists, especially two-wheeler riders are the most inconvenienced. Uttam Gaonkar who uses this route frequently said the road was hot-mixed last year. “How could the road worsen so soon. Why is the PWD not making the contractor accountable for the bad road,” he said. “This is the main highway leading to the chief minister’s constituency and it develops potholes almost every year during monsoon. The CM should seriously look into the matter and inquire about the contractor’s work,” another resident said. Villagers are demanding immediate repairs and say that the chief minister’s office should oversee the hot-mixing as soon as the monsoon gets over.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/residents-demand-repair-of-potholed-bicholim-sakhali-rd/articleshow/86354420.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Before quitting, Captain Amarinder Singh gave details of his govt’s performance in a letter to Congress president Sonia Gandhi||CHANDIGARH: Hours before he formally submitted his resignation on Saturday to the governor, Captain Amarinder Singh had on Saturday written to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, apprising her of his decision, while expressing anguish at the political events of the last five months, which he said were clearly “not based on the full understanding of the national imperatives of Punjab and its key concerns.” “Notwithstanding my personal anguish, I hope this will not cause any damage to the hard-earned peace and development in the State, and that the efforts I have been focusing during the last few years, would continue unabated, ensuring justice to one and all,” Captain Amarinder had written, indicating his apprehension of instability in Punjab as a result of the political developments in the state unit of the Congress. At the same time, Amarinder expressed his personal satisfaction at having done his best for the people as chief minister of Punjab, which, as a border state, “has many geo-political and other internal security concerns, which I tried to handle effectively without any compromise.” He said he was happy that the state remained fully peaceful, and there was complete communal harmony with no ill-will towards anyone. While she (Sonia) herself may be personally aware of some of the things achieved in the last four and a half years, “the people of Punjab are looking up to the Indian National Congress for its mature and effective public policies, which not only reflect upon good politics but also address the concerns of the common man that are specific to this border State,” wrote Amarinder, while informing the Congress president about his decision to demit the office of the chief minister, Punjab, after completing nine-and-a-half years as such from 2002 to 2007 and March 2017 to September 2021. In these nine-and-a-half years, Captain said he had worked wholeheartedly for the welfare of the people of Punjab - the state he loves from the core of his heart. “This was extremely satisfying for me because not only I established the rule of law, and ensured transparent governance, but maintained ethical conduct even in the management of political affairs, winning 8 out of 13 seats in the parliamentary elections in 2019 and the PRI and ULB Elections decisively.” Referring to the numerous challenges faced by him over the last four-and-a-half years in fulfilling the promises made by the Punjab Congress in the Punjab elections 2017, he pointed out that these notwithstanding, of the total promises made, his government had fulfilled 89.2%, while work was in progress on the remaining commitments. Citing the challenges posed by the pandemic Covid-19, he said his government faced the same in an effective and well-coordinated manner, ensuring minimum loss of public lives. On the issue of the sacrilege cases and the subsequent police action of 2015, Amarinder said his government, which was committed to ensuring justice in the matter, had established a judicial commission of inquiry headed by Justice (Retd) Ranjit Singh, whose report was received on 16th August 2018. The report was accepted and full legal action was taken thereon, he said, sharing details of the same. He pointed out that despite legal hurdles and refusal of CBI to return the cases, which were transferred to them by the SAD-BJP government, his government had succeeded in filing 10 challans, while 24 persons had been charge-sheeted, 15 police personnel suspended, and 10 civilians arrested. “The criminal proceedings in these cases are currently underway and I am sure that in due course justice will be done in due course,” he said. With regard to the controversial power purchase agreements that were signed by the previous government for the purchase of expensive power to ensure affordable supply to the people of the State, Amarinder said his government had invested Rs 3,709 crore in electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure from 2017-21 and released about Rs 11,000 crore per annum to the benefit of 22 lac SC/BC consumers, and 14 lakh farmers. “For the first time, we supplied subsidised power to the industry at an annual cost of over Rs 2,000 crore,” he said, adding that “the review of the PPAs is currently underway.” Talking about the farmers, whom he described as the backbone of Punjab’s economy, he wrote that in line with its commitment to provide debt relief and repeal statutory provisions of attaching their properties, his government had given debt relief of Rs 4,624 crore to 5.64 lakh farmers and Rs 526 crore to 2.68 lakh farmworkers. “In addition, we have repealed Section 67-A of the Punjab State Cooperative Societies Act, 1961, and also amended the Civil Procedure Code, disallowing attachment of agricultural land up to 2.5 acres,” he added. Referring to his personal promise to the people of Punjab to break the back of drug peddlers and smugglers in the State, he said he had done so relentlessly by establishing a Special Task Force (STF) in this regard. Pointing to his government’s 3-pronged strategy titled EDP – Enforcement, De-addiction, and Prevention, he said as a result, 62,744 persons had been arrested, 202 OOAT clinics established, 6,28,083 Drug Abuse Prevention Officers (DAPOs) registered, and 9,51,202 Buddy Groups formed. He noted that with the revamp of the mining policy of the state in 2017, the state’s revenue had increased from Rs 35 crore per annum to Rs 300 crore per annum.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/before-quitting-amarinder-gave-details-of-his-govts-performance-in-a-letter-to-sonia/articleshow/86354446.cms||---

A close aide of Captain Amarinder, Nanda was working as AG Punjab since 2017, when the Congress government was formed in the state. Nanda resigned as the post of AG was co-terminus with the CM. As per the information, around 12 law officers have also resigned from the AG office. “You are all by now aware that the Chief Minister of Punjab, Captain Amarinder Singh resigned yesterday.

In case, I have fallen short of your expectations or I have faltered at any time, please forgive me,” Nanda has said.

He said it was condemnable that the conspirators behind this heinous crime were not being brought to book. “No attempt is being made to investigate the antecedents of the culprit and find out whether he was instigated to commit this ghastly act to spoil the peace of the state,” Sukhbir added. The SAD president said it was unfortunate that the police had not acted in the matter even five days after the heinous sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib. “Incidents of sacrilege are taking place on a regular basis, but the police are not able to uncover the conspiracy behind the incident,” he added. Earlier too, peace and communal harmony of Punjab was destroyed by committing acts of sacrilege in both gurdwaras and temples, he said. “This time too, the Congress government has failed to prevent these planned incidents of sacrilege which have the propensity to lead to communal clashes and spoil the peace and communal harmony of Punjab. If this conspiracy is not nipped in the bud, then the state could go back to the dark era,” warned the SAD president.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/why-govt-not-exposing-conspirators-of-sacrilege-at-kesgarh-sahib-sukhbir/articleshow/86354501.cms||---

As it happened, Singh did not go that far, but Congress managers had assessed that the Centre may not have been overly interested in sending a soft signal to the governor as it did not have much skin in the game.

It was on September 19, 2020 that the seeds of the farmers’ struggle were sown in Moga. On this day, different farmer unions that were protesting against farm ordinances brought in by Narendra Modi government in June 2020, decided to join hands and put up a collective struggle. The coordinated work initiated by 32 farm unions of Punjab on this day laid the foundation for a larger pan-Indian coalition that was subsequently created on October 27 and November 4. Thus began Sanyukt Kisan Morcha’s struggle at the all-India level. SKM also said they have not participated in the meeting called by Haryana government to discuss giving way to Delhi from borders as it is Haryana and Delhi police who have put up barricades and blocked the roads. According to SKM, protesting farmers have created clear paths on both sides of the road at Singhu border as well as Tikri border for traffic to move, and have been forced to occupy only one side of the road at Ghazipur border. Same is the situation at Shahjahanpur border and other morchas, they added. SKM reminded Union government and state governments concerned that the Supreme Court in its order has made them responsible for coordinating, whereas farmer unions were being dragged into this by Haryana government. SKM stated that a meeting was organised on Sunday at Mohali to appeal to milk vendors and vegetable sellers to support the Bharat Bandh. Reports indicate that planning meetings are happening in different parts of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Maharashtra and Telangana. “There has been tremendous response from merchants and traders, employees’ unions, lawyers’ associations, transporters’ unions, trade and worker unions and others to the bandh proposal so far, and support has been pledged by different sections of society. Many political parties have also pledged their support,” stated SKM.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/one-year-of-pb-farmer-unions-joining-hands-to-fight-farm-laws-together/articleshow/86354536.cms||---

Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) member secretary Krunesh Garg said the necessary directions have already been issued to the deputy commissioners concerned to give special attention to the hotspot villages, as each of such villages had witnessed more than 25 fire incidents during last season. Punjab government has identified Patiala, Sangrur, Barnala, Bathinda, Ferozepur, Muktsar, Tarn Taran, Moga and Mansa as hotspot districts where more than 4,000 active fire incidents of paddy stubble burning were reported in the past. The PPCB member secretary also said a control room in each district has also been set up for monitoring the stubble burning incidents, uploading of the data to mobile apps to the dashboard and preparation and submission of action taken reports to different quarters. These nodal officers have been deputed for each affected village to create awareness among the farmers to refrain them from stubble burning besides keeping a strict vigil over the post-harvesting operations. The nodal officers have been deputed from various departments at district-level including PPCB, cooperation, revenue, rural development and panchayats, agriculture, horticulture and soil conservation. These nodal officers have been asked to raise awareness in villages by way of holding meetings with the farmers, arranging crop residue management (CRM) machines, distribution of pamphlets and leaflets in villages besides taking other measures of disseminating information to educate them against the harmful effects of stubble burning. The state government has supplied 76,626 subsidiSed agro-machines to the farmers, cooperative societies, panchayats and custom hiring centres (CHCs) under the CRM scheme in the last three years. The Punjab agriculture and farmers’ welfare department has already sanctioned more than 31,000 machines this year against the applications received from the farmers, panchayats and CHCs for purchasing agri-machinery on 50% to 80% subsidy for in-situ and ex-situ management of paddy stubble.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pb-deputes-8500-nodal-officers-at-hotspot-villages-to-ensure-zero-stubble-burning/articleshow/86354543.cms||---
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: Didn’t script political history by joining TMC, want to be in ‘playing 11’, says Asansol MP Babul Supriyo||KOLKATA: A day after joining Trinamool Congress, Asansol MP and former Union minister Babul Supriyo said he “did not script political history by joining TMC” and added that he was grateful to chief minister Mamata Banerjee and Abhishek Banerjee for giving him a chance in the “playing 11”. “I want to be in the ‘playing 11’ and not relegated to the reserve benches. I am grateful that chief minister Mamata Banerjee and Abhishek Banerjee empathized with the fact that I was being retired hurt and provided me with a fantastic and challenging opportunity to work for people in Bengal,” Babul said at a press conference on Sunday, flanked by senior Trinamool MPs Saugata Roy and Derek O’Brien. Babul said he had sought an appointment with Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla on Wednesday to tender his resignation. “If I get an appointment, I will do it on Wednesday,” he added. On Monday, he is likely to meet the chief minister. Babul, however, parried all questions on his future role in TMC. “All I can say is when I came to play this innings, I had never foreseen that I would be made to retire hurt. Whatever I had said on quitting politics was a reaction to certain events. Over the past few days, life has again given me an opening. It is a role of immense opportunity and responsibility.” Speaking about his entry into Trinamool, Babul said: “To quote Mario Puzo, Derek (O’Brien) first made me an offer which I couldn’t refuse. My subsequent meetings with the chief minister and Abhishek have been very inspiring.” “I have always worked and spoken with an open mind. I will not delete my past social media posts,” he said. Babul said if PM Narendra Modi gave people hope in 2014, chief minister Mamata Banerjee was giving people the same hope ahead of 2024. “She is the face for 2024. She is a record three-time chief minister of Bengal. She is by far the most popular leader in the country now. And she doesn’t need anyone to say that,” he said. Reacting to the barrage of criticism by BJP leaders against him, Babul said, “I do not feel it is necessary to respond to all of them. I did hear what Shamik Bhattacharya (Bengal BJP spokesperson) said. I also noticed that he said I am untainted. There are several leaders who joined the BJP too. I share my birthday with one of them (Babul and Suvendu Adhikari share their birthday on December 15, 1970). They (BJP) are entitled to their views.” In a separate social media post, Babul wrote: “BJP has also taken in rival political leaders and put them on the top ignoring grassroots workers.” Speaking on Babul’s induction into TMC, Roy, a veteran MP, said, “I have been a Babul fan since the ‘Kaho Naa… Pyaar Hai’ days. Babul is a popular singer and has an easy acceptability in Bengal. Babul’s joining has already invigorated party workers and infused hope.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/babul-didnt-script-political-history-by-joining-tmc-want-to-be-in-playing-11/articleshow/86354328.cms||---

The phone call is at the request of Biden, government spokesman Gabriel Attal said. What the French now call a "grave crisis" erupted over the sudden, surprise end to a 2016 contract worth at least $66 billion between France and Australia to build 12 conventional diesel-electric submarines. Instead, Australia signed on with the US and Britain for eight nuclear-powered submarines. France insists it was not informed of the deal in advance. "What's at play in this affair, this crisis are strategic issues before being commercial issues," Attal said in an interview on BFMTV. "The question is ... the forces present, the balance, in the Indo-Pacific where part of our future is at play, and our relations with China." The deal by the US reflects the American pivot toward the Indo-Pacific region, seen as increasingly strategic as China bolsters its influence there. Yet France feels the deal steps on its feet in a region where it has long had a strong presence that it, too, is working to bolster. "France is a country of the Indo-Pacific," Attal said, noting the French territory of New Caledonia, the French citizens living in the region and the French military forces based there. The Indo-Pacific is also an issue for Europe, he said. Macron will be seeking explanations from Biden about what led to a "major rupture in confidence," the spokesman added. "There was a moment of shock, of anger ... Now, we must advance."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/submarine-spat-france-says-biden-wants-talks-with-macron/articleshow/86356197.cms||---
---||Chennai||Police brass split over plan to trifurcate city commissionerate||CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu government’s announcement creating two new police commissioner offices – at Avadi and Tambaram – has evoked mixed reactions from the police force. Former director-general of police Bholonath supported trifurcation of Chennai commissionerate by adding new police stations from the adjacent revenue districts, saying the head of the police force can coordinate and streamline their activities. “Officers heading the two new commissionerates can be of lesser rank than the Greater Chennai Commissioner, so that there will not be any ego clash among them,” he said. But, it is not easy to divide the special units like the cybercrime wing and other wings,”said former DGP S R Jangid. “Manpower has to be divided as per workload. For instance, Puzhal prison would fall under the Avadi commissionerate and it has to handle prisoner escorts from Chennai to other districts, and even other states. It is a Herculean task.” He, however, said a population of more than 1.25 crore needs more commissionerates so that people could access their commissioner easily. Retired officer S Aravindan pointed out that there are only about 20 police stations each in Avadi and Tambaram jurisdiction at present. Building a separate commissionerate is not an easy task, as they must have their own own armed reserve and special police units to handle emergencies. Every police project cannot be triplicated, he said, adding: “Creation of command centres for the Chennai-Integrated Traffic (CIT) System project is on at a cost of ?700 crore, and a control centre for the women safety is being set up at the cost of ?170 crore. CIT involves 165 traffic junctions stretching from Tambaram to Parry’s Corner, and includes places like Porur and Koyambedu. These junctions are synced with a centralised command centre at the commissioner’s office. If each commissionerate needs a such a common centre, it will be a triplication of work and project, said Aravindan. Retired DGP and former Chennai city police commissioner Letika Saran is totally against the trifurcation move, saying: “I never felt that I Chennai police jurisdiction is vast. As a single unit, one commissioner can perform well and execute his powers evenly to all the individuals under the jurisdiction.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/police-brass-split-over-plan-to-trifurcate-city-commissionerate/articleshow/86362941.cms||A Selvaraj
---||Goa||Accused in drugs cases cannot insist on default bail, says high court of Bombay at Goa||PANAJI: The high court of Bombay at Goa has held that accused in cases registered under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act cannot insist on default bail as long as police have filed their report to the court in the stipulated time and even if there is no chemical analysis (CA) or Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) report. “….we hold that the presentation of a police report under Section 173(2) unaccompanied by a CA/FSL report does not amount to any incomplete police report or any incomplete chargesheet/challan even in the absence of an extension of time under Section 36-A(4) of the NDPS Act. Based thereon therefore the accused cannot insist upon a default bail,” Justices Mahesh Sonak and M S Jawalkar stated. “Similarly, we hold that a police report under Section 173(2) or a chargesheet/challan accompanied by field testing reports as reflected in the panchanama or otherwise also cannot be labelled as an incomplete police report/chargesheet/challan simply because the same was not accompanied by a CA/FSL,” the court further stated. The court also held that the Drug Law Enforcement Field Officers’ Handbook issued by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) “has no legal efficacy, in the sense that the handbook has no statutory flavour or the handbook is not a set of executive instructions issued by the central government...” However, while stating that the handbook in the context of the ‘drug detection kit’ in fact states that these kits assist the investigating officer (IOs) in forming a reasonable belief about a substance being a drug, the court held that “...it is essential that the IOs conduct the test, match the resultant colour, and form a reasonable belief that a substance gives a positive colour pattern for a drug. The handbook itself makes it clear that this process must be recorded in the panchanama. The handbook also states that the tests are only indicative and it is possible that a designated laboratory may return a negative report. But this is far cry from suggesting that the handbook castigates the field testing reports as totally unreliable”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/absence-of-chemical-analyser-report-does-not-entitle-ndps-accused-default-bail/articleshow/86353615.cms||---

Bhunia was asked to appear before the central investigating agency’s CGO complex office on Monday. Earlier in March, the ED had summoned the minister in connection to the probe. According to sources, Bhunia, who had allegedly been present at a programme organized by the iCore Group, is likely to be questioned about that. The ED has also come across video footage where Bhunia is seen at a function of the group. “I was not at home the entire day. I do not know whether any such notice has been served on me,” Bhunia said. “They wake up before elections. This will again subside after the bypoll. They may again raise these issues before the 2024 Lok Sabha polls,” Kolkata mayor Firhad Hakim said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ed-summons-bhunia-in-ponzi-probe/articleshow/86354324.cms||---
---||Kolkata||New low in politics, says TMC after BJP’s ISI barb at West Bengal cabinet minister Firhad Hakim||KOLKATA: Bengal BJP general secretary Sayantan Basu on Sunday alleged that “people call Firhad Hakim an ISI agent,” prompting his party, facing strong criticism, to distance itself from what it called Basu’s “personal” remarks, and Trinamool and other party leaders to condemn it as a “new low in politics”. Hakim, a state cabinet minister, coordinator of KMC’s ward 82 who heads the corporation’s board, and an MLA from Kolkata (Port), responded that not more than 60 voters out of the 45,000 who had elected him to the KMC were from the minority community, and that people had voted for him without looking at his religion. Basu, speaking to the press in Salt Lake on Sunday, said Hakim must decide which party he wanted to remain in — the Trinamool, or any other political outfit. “Bobby Hakim is not a Bengali. People in his area call him an agent of ISI,” Basu said. “Does he think that people have forgotten his Mini Pakistan statement that came out in a Pakistani newspaper? Moreover, he is not a Bengali himself. How can he brand the BJP as a party of non-Bengali-speaking people?” Hakim, in his response, condemned Basu’s “politics of communalism”. “Just because my name is Firhad Hakim, can they put such labels on me? I don’t feel an urge to engage in such politics of communalism,” he said, adding, “Unlike them, we do not need to divide people on the lines of religion. People love us for the work we do. The (KMC) ward, which elected me with a record margin, has around 60 minority voters. Had he (Sayantan) understood this, he would have won at least one election. I seek votes for my work. I am religious at heart but believe in secularism. My country and its people always come first.” Trinamool general-secretary Kunal Ghosh was more cutting in his remark: “First BJP lost the polls; now, they have lost their mind. Agents are not based on their names or surnames. This is a new low in politics.” Antu Dhar, a close aide of Hakim’s, said the BJP ad its leaders should “first learn about the Hakim family” before speaking. The Hakims are long-time residents of Chetla. Firhad’s mother, Monika Mukherjee, a Fern Road resident and headmistress of a government-aided school, married Abdul Hakim, a lawyer. Monika had played a key role in educating girls, especially those from the minority community. Two of Firhad’s sisters — Shyama and Jeeti — have married Hindus. His wife, Ismat, participates in every activity at the Chetla Agrani Durga Puja. “This is a new low in politics,” former Congress MP Pradip Bhattacharya said, adding, “It is in very bad taste. One may have a political rivalry with another person, but cannot stoop so low. What proof does he (Basu) have to this claim? This never happened in Bengal’s politics before.” Former Left legislative party leader Sujan Chakraborty said: “What Basu said is unacceptable. I don’t believe the allegation. Even if there is any truth, why haven’t they initiated any investigation against him?” The BJP, too, distanced itself from Basu’s comments, with the party’s Bengal spokesperson, Shamik Bhattacharya, saying he had made those in his “personal” capacity, but adding, “ He was perhaps trying to articulate a public perception.” Basu himself defended his comments, saying, “I had merely said what people think (of him).” Bhattacharya alleged it wasn’t the BJP, but the TMC, which was fanning hatred along religious lines. “This had led to such public perceptions,” Bhattacharya said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/new-low-in-pol-says-tmc-after-bjps-isi-barb-at-firhad/articleshow/86354429.cms||Saikat Ray

Bangladesh deputy high commissioner Toufique Hasan expressed satisfaction at the development, which will increase excha- nge between the nations. Bangladeshi nationals started arriving at the border from Sunday morning in order to go back home. However, there were allegations that due to lack of coordination, BSF did not allow citizens of the neighbouring country to enter India despite having valid documents. The situation was sorted out by evening and Bangladeshis, most of whom were coming for medical treatment, were finally allowed in. Many local traders were unhappy as the confusion at the border caused them to lose a day’s business. Foreign exchange agent Dinabandhu Mahaldar said they had been living hand-to-mouth since Gede was closed a year and a half ago. He added that before lockdown, they had bulk business as 2,000 to 3,000 people would cross the border daily.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/gede-border-opens-after-18-months/articleshow/86353442.cms||Ashis Poddar
---||Kolkata||Political tourist’s exit won’t affect party: Bengal BJP||Kolkata: A day after Babul Supriyo joined Trinamool Congress, the former Union minister drew strong criticism from his former party colleagues who said BJP workers’ “anger” against him “is real”. “Political tourist” Babul’s exit, BJP seniors claimed, would not affect the party. “He is merely a political tourist who believes in hopping political parties. That will never impact Bengal’s politics. Like a deformed brick, they can’t be set in any structure. You have to break them into pieces to have some utility,” Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh said. Ghosh, who was not on “good terms” with Babul and had “ignored” his comments earlier, on Sunday said he came to know about the former Union minister’s move to Trinamool through social media. “He came with a lot of pomp and show, and made a silent exit. There will be discussion for a day or two, but that will not affect BJP,” he added. In response, Babul said: “I have nothing to say. Like there is Shashi Tharoor’s English, there is Dilip da’s Bengali. I wish to send him Vidyasagar’s ‘Barnaparichay’ with due respect.” BJP’s Rajya Sabha MP Swapan Dasgupta was critical of Babul’s “tearing hurry” to join Trinamool. “He may end up damaging his own image,” said Dasgupta, who had earlier praised Babul as an “asset to the BJP”. On Sunday, the MP said: “The anger of BJP supporters at @SuPriyoBabul’s defection is very real, as is the disgust of ordinary people over people shifting sides. Learning to digest adversity & having patience are part of politics.” Babul responded via Twitter to say that political rivals who had earlier joined BJP “were embraced and made to sit on top posts ignoring all those ‘real’ BJP grassroot fighters”. “(They) should be dumped because they may have spoiled their images and tarnished the BJP’s image,” he added. Former governor Tathagata Roy’s “traitor” barb, however, drew a sharp retort from Babul, who dubbed the reaction “crass” and one that didn’t behove the high posts the former had held. Bengal BJP vice-president Arjun Singh took a dig at Babul for his poll defeat in Tollygunge assembly segment. “He was defeated by 50,000 votes. He was never a factor in BJP,” Arjun said. BJP’s Bhowanipore bypoll candidate Priyanka Tibrewal, a family friend of Babul for nearly 15 years, on Sunday said the change in political camp would not affect personal relations. “We knew each other even before we came into politics. I hope personal relations do not get strained due to changed political ideologies. Had I been in his shoes, I would not have campaigned in Bhowanipore,” she said.

---||World||Canada goes to vote today, opinion polls indicate Trudeau has an edge||MONTREAL: The leaders of Canada's main political parties on Sunday kicked off the final day of campaigning ahead of Monday's election, with polls indicating that the Liberals of PM Justin Trudeau hold an edge. Trudeau, 49, called the vote two years early to seek public approval for his left-of-centre government's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic and regain the majority in parliament that he lost in 2019. He first took power in 2015. His initial healthy lead vanished amid voter unhappiness with the early call. Polls show that neither the Liberals nor their rival right-leaning Conservatives have anywhere near the 38% public support needed for a majority. Trudeau, whose government racked up record levels of debt to tackle the pandemic, intends to fly from one end of the country to the other on Sunday, covering some 4,500 km, in a last-minute bid to rustle up votes. "We now get to pick the right direction for our country to keep moving forward, or to let Conservatives take us back," Trudeau told a crowd at his first event of the day in Montreal. In contrast, Conservative leader Erin O'Toole planned to spend the entire day in parliamentary constituencies near Toronto, Canada's largest city and pivotal for any party seeking to win power. O'Toole, 48, initially took a lead after hammering Trudeau over what he called an unnecessary a power grab during the fourth wave of Covid-19. But in recent days he has been on the defensive over his opposition to the idea of vaccine mandates. "We do not need a government that won't be able to show the leadership on vaccinations and on science that we need to end this," Trudeau said in Montreal. A string of opinion polls in the final days show the Liberals and Conservatives tied at around 32%. This favours the Liberals, whose support is focused in large urban centers rich with constituencies. The Conservatives' support base is in sparsely populated rural regions and the west of the country. If Trudeau does come back with another minority, he would likely depend once again on the left-leaning New Democrats of Jagmeet Singh, who want higher levels of spending.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/canada-goes-to-vote-today-opinion-polls-indicate-trudeau-has-an-edge/articleshow/86356230.cms||---

Eight authors were selected this year for the prestigious fellowship. Ruskin Bond, M Leelavathy, Bhalchandra Nemade, Tejwant Singh Gill, Swami Rambhadracharya and Indira Parthasarathy are among the others. The general council of Sahitya Akademi met under the chairmanship of its president Chandrashekhar Kambar on Saturday and announced the names, considered to be its highest honour for senior authors. Among writers from Bengal who had been selected fellows in the past are Subhas Mukhopadhyay and Nirendranath Chakraborty. The Bengali literary world was elated, especially because an honour like this has come to Bengal after a long time. Mukhopadhyay started out his literary career with a short story ‘Jaltaranga’ in 1959. His first novel ‘Ghunpoka’ was published eight years later. Among his other popular works are ‘Parthibo’, ‘Nayan Shyama’, ‘Parapar’, ‘Durbin’, ‘Ekadashi O Bhoot’, among others. ‘Manojder Adbhut Bari’ was his first novel for children. Apart from Sahitya Akademi award, the other major awards that he won are Vidyasagar award, that was given to him in 1985 for his contributions to children’s literature, and Banga Bibhushan award in 2012. The number of Sahitya Akademi fellows at no point in time exceeds 21. In the literary world, the fellows picked up by the Akademi are touted as “immortals of Indian literature.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/sahitya-akademi-fellowship-for-shirshendu/articleshow/86351746.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Private hospitals ready paediatric units, train doctors & nurses||KOLKATA: Several private hospitals in Kolkata are gearing up to augment facilities at their paediatric wards and training their doctors and nurses to be ready for a sudden spurt in paediatric Covid admissions, which is being feared during the impending third wave. Even though most paediatric wards at these hospitals still have enough vacancies, a swift rush of patients is not being ruled out. The state has already augmented children’s wards at multiple government hospitals and conducted a training programme for health workers. Medica Superspecialty Hospital has already trained a team of doctors and nurses to attend to paediatric Covid patients. “We have scaled up the number of paediatric beds to 50. If needed, we will convert more beds and integrate them into the ward,” said Medica chairperson Alok Roy. He added that other than healthworkers, employees at all levels have been trained to attend to Covid-affected kids. Peerless Hospital is ready with paediatric consumables and has purchased three paediatric ventilators, other than tubes and masks. “We don’t have any Covid-affected kids now but had one last week. In fact, out of our 18 paediatric beds, six are now occupied while our eight-bed PICU is vacant. But we are getting a plan ready to use sections of our Covid wards for paediatric Covid patients,” said Peerless CEO Sudipta Mitra. Peerless now has 22 adult Covid patients in its 40-bed Covid ward. A comprehensive paediatric and neonatal Covid treatment set-up with 35 general paediatric ward beds, 24 PICU and 6 NICU beds has been planned at RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences (RTIICS). According to zonal head R Venkatesh, it will have adequate pediatric and neonatal ventilators. “Paediatric consultants and nurses trained to handle such patients are also there. Since there are no paediatric Covid patients now, we have not activated the same and are using it for non-Covid paediatric treatment,” added Venkatesh. Currently, RTIICS has 21 adult covid patients with eight in critical care. AMRI Hospitals has set up a six-member paediatric-Covid panel. “We are drawing up an SOP for paediatric Covid care,” said CEO Rupak Barua. Bhagirathi Neotia Women & Child Care Centre is planning to activate a 50-bed unit at New Town campus. “If needed, we will use the existing facilities at Rawdon Street,” said Neotia Healthcare director PL Mehta.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pvt-hosps-ready-paediatric-units-train-docs-nurses/articleshow/86351701.cms||Prithvijit Mitra

Speaking to ANI, Rawat said, "It (Congress face for upcoming state assembly polls) will be decided by the Congress president, but given the circumstances, elections will be fought with the chief minister's cabinet under Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee, whose chief is Navjot Singh Sidhu, who is very popular." He further stated that Congress had yesterday itself unanimously decided to make Charanjit Singh Channi the next chief minister of Punjab. "The decision (to choose the new Punjab CM) was taken yesterday. We were only waiting to meet the governor. The party was unanimous on Charanjit Singh Channi's name. We will try to ensure that he (Amarinder Singh) is there at oath-taking, but it's up to him," said Rawat. He said that the names for two deputy chief ministers are yet to be decided. "Our mutual feeling is that there should be two deputy CMs. Soon we will take a call on it along with names for the Council of Ministers. Some names have been discussed but it's the CM's prerogative who will discuss it with party high command and take a call," the former Uttarakhand chief minister said. Congress MLA Charanjit Singh Channi will take the oath as the new Chief Minister of Punjab on Monday at 11am on Monday. Addressing media after meeting governor Banwarilal Purohit, the chief minister-designate of Punjab said, "We have presented our stance, unanimously supported by party MLAs, before the Governor. Oath taking ceremony will take place at 11 am tomorrow." Channi will succeed Captain Amarinder Singh, who resigned as the chief minister of Punjab on Saturday following months of infighting between him and Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) chief Navjot Singh Sidhu. These development came months before the 2022 Punjab Assembly elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/congress-will-fight-2022-punjab-polls-under-navjot-singh-sidhu-says-harish-rawat/articleshow/86356344.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh No. 1 in execution of 44 central schemes: CM Yogi Adityanath||LUCKNOW: With his government completing 4.5 years on Sunday, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath listed out its achievements at an event held in Lucknow on Sunday. The event, marked as ‘Vikas Utsav’ with a tagline of “Soch Imaandaar, Kam Damdaar...Chha Gayi Yogi Sarkaar”, also had the presence of BJP vice-president and UP in charge Radha Mohan Singh and UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh. In another rebuttal to the opposition, the CM also defended his government with a firm assertion over management of the two waves of Corona pandemic even as many other states faced resurgence of new cases. Yogi did not miss the chance to lash out at the opposition parties for avoiding going to Hindu religious centres like Ayodhya and Mathura out of fear of getting tagged as “communal”. “But the BJP did not think so and organised events that marked the religious and cultural identity of the places,” he said. Launching a blistering attack on the previous SP government, Yogi said that this is the same UP where criminals and mafia dons enjoyed political patronage and riots happened every fourth day. “Now, no riots happen and criminals are facing the wrath of the government,” he said, highlighting his government’s achievement of seizing illegally occupied land worth nearly Rs 1,800 crore. The CM pointed out that UP is ranked No. 1 in the implementation of 44 central schemes among all states in the country. He added that the state government launched the Mission Shakti programme for the safety and empowerment of women. Yogi said 1.38 crore poor have ben provided free power connections while 2.61 crore toilets have been built in the state in the past 4.5 years. In terms of infrastructure also, UP has been making rapid progress with the construction of expressways. Besides, the state currently boasts of five international airports and eight domestic airports while work is underway on 10 airports, the CM said. He also slammed the previous CMs for vying to make big bungalows for themselves while ignoring the basic needs of the people. “But we did not make houses for self but provided houses to as many as 42 lakh people,” Yogi said, in an apparent jibe at SP chief Akhilesh Yadav and BSP chief Mayawati. He also underscored that it was the team work of the state government and the BJP organisation that the needs of the people were fulfilled. He also credited the leadership of PM Narendra Modi and other senior BJP leaders, including party president JP Nadda and home minister Amit Shah in helping the state government achieve its goals. “We managed to infuse confidence among people about governance and facilitate them on various fronts. And this is the real identity of the present government,” he said. He said that UP used to witness deaths due to hunger. “But after BJP came to power it was found that nearly 40 lakh needy people did not have the ration cards, which were otherwise used fraudulently by other people. We put a check on the practice and connected all 80,000 PDS shops with e-PoS machines,” he said. Yogi added that the state government also ensured that people get adequate compensation in times of crisis. “We transferred Rs 5 lakh crore to the needy through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) in the last four and a half year period,” he said. On the employment front, he said, youth were given jobs on the basis of merit, while following reservation provisions, and not by their “identity”. In a veiled attack on the opposition, Yogi said that earlier the “whole Khandaan” used to move out to “extort money” from the job seekers. “Now, there is no `dalaali’ and over 4.5 lakh jobs were given to the youth,” he said, insisting that even the transfer and posting of officials in the government had become an “industry” in the previous government. “But in the past 4.5 years, no one can level a charge of corruption in the transfer of officials. We have been able to provide a stable government,” he said. Yogi said that the “swift decision making” image of his government and improvement in UP’s ranking from 14th to 2nd position in “ease of doing business” attracted a host of big investors to the state. He said even the small and medium scale industries, which were dying a slow death in the previous government, were now exporting products worth over Rs 1.21 lakh crore. The CM also took a pot shot at the previous SP and BSP governments — spanning between 2007 and 2017 — accusing them of paying a paltry Rs 95,000 crore to the cane growers. “In contrast our 4.5-year rule saw cane farmers being given a compensation of over Rs 1.43 lakh crore,” he said. He also cited the example of paddy and wheat procurement which, he claimed, remained as low as 6 lakh MT per annum in the previous government. This, Yogi said, increased to 66 lakh MT annually in case of paddy and 56 lakh MT in case of wheat, despite the Corona pandemic. Yogi’s statement came amid the ongoing farm protest which threatens to take political overtones in politically restive west UP region.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/uttar-pradesh-no-1-in-execution-of-44-central-schemes-cm-yogi-adityanath/articleshow/86356347.cms||Pankaj Shah

But it was much less than the 28.91 lakh vaccinated in last Sunday’s special drive. The Greater Chennai Corporation, however, vaccinated 2.01 lakh people (98,227 first dose, 93,123 second dose) across its 15 zones, more than last Sunday’s 1.85 lakh. A GCC official said that the number was achieved as centres were set up in the vicinity of people's homes as well as in public places that they would visit on Sundays. A total of 1,600 centres were set up across the city including at malls, near the Gandhi statue on Marina beach and at bus stands. Mobile vaccination camps went to different localities targeting migrant workers and senior citizens. The maximum number of jabs were given in Ambattur zone (18,480). In central TN, more than 3.3 lakh people were inoculated on Sunday. Karur district topped the region by vaccinating more than one lakh people, surpassing even the bigger districts across the state including Coimbatore (94,723), Madurai (72,561) and Trichy (64,448). In Trichy city, the prizes announced for taking the jabs have also helped the municipal corporation use all vaccine stock before the evening. Through sponsors, the civic body had announced ?60,000 worth of prizes including gold coins, bicycles and silk saris. Winners are to be selected through a lot system. Trichy city has so far vaccinated more than 58% of the eligible population. Floating population in the airport, railway junction and bus stands was also covered on Sunday. In Madurai and other southern districts, people who have been waiting for the second dose of Covaxin for more than a week got it at the mass vaccination camp. Tamil Nadu Health Minister Ma Subramanian inspected vaccine centres in Salem, Erode, Namakkal and Dharmapuri on Sunday.

The Indian Banks' Association (IBA) has communicated to its members that it has received the revised quotes, following a request for proposals floated by the bank's body. "High incurred claim ratio of 147.2% for retirees without domiciliary policy and 163.3% for retirees with domiciliary policy (as on July 31, 2021) have resulted in the increase in premiums for renewal of policies compared to last year," the IBA said. Kolkata-based National Insurance Company is understood to have continued with the account. Domiciliary cover refers to the extension of the policy to cover treatment at home. For retired bank officers, the premium for Rs 4 lakh cover without domiciliary has gone up 34% to Rs 36,652 from Rs 27,342. For retired workmen, the cost has gone up 40% to Rs 28,715 from Rs 20,508 for a Rs 3 lakh cover. With the domiciliary option, the cost has gone up lower. For retired workmen, the cost of the same cover is now Rs 55,175 which is 8.4% higher than Rs s 50.893 last year and for officers, it is 7.5% higher at Rs 72, 917 from Rs 67,853 last year. IBA negotiates group insurance on behalf of retired employees who are required to pay the premium. National Insurance Company has offered lower-premium cover for lower-sum insured and for policies where the retiree does not have a surviving spouse or the retiree is survived by a spouse. Insurers say cost of most group policies that have come up for renewal after the second wave has seen an increase because of a higher payout.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/health-cover-costs-to-rise-for-retired-bankers/articleshow/86356403.cms||---

The tribunal quashed the order issued by the Union environment ministry exempting Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) from conducting public hearing and asked authorities to file a fresh Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) report, which explains the possible environmental impact of the project, with inputs from the hearing. Tangedco, the state power utility which established the plant in 1989, had mooted two proposals to expand the existing plant or replace it. To expand the project, Tangedco obtained an environmental clearance in 2008 by conducting a public hearing. ‘Important to document apprehensions of public’Since expansion work could not be completed on time, it sought multiple extensions. But the environment ministry in 2019 refused to extend the validity of the EC beyond 10 years and asked Tangedco to apply for a fresh EC. When Tangedco applied for a fresh EC in January 2019, it sought exemption from conducting public hearing to avoid further delay. The corporation also said that a public hearing was conducted in 2017 for the replacement project on the same premises. The green ministry’s expert appraisal committee and subcommittee rejected this request. But after repeated appeals, the ministry in July 2019 agreed to exempt Tangedco from holding public hearing. Applicant R L Srinivasan in 2020 moved the NGT bench seeking direction to quash the EC granted by the ministry without public hearing as it was in direct violation of Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification, 2006. During the hearing, Tangedco submitted that the EIA report was uploaded on its website and not on the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) site that organises public hearings. Taking not of this, the tribunal said: “There is no possibility for the public to know about the contents of the EIA report to raise their objection before the authorities and there was no possibility for the Expert Appraisal Committee to get the views from the public on this aspect.” The NGT also said that it is necessary to document the apprehensions and views of the public who are likely to be affected by the project and opportunity must be given for public consultation before taking decisions on the EC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-ngt-suspends-nod-to-expand-ennore-thermal-power-unit/articleshow/86356427.cms||Ram Sundaram

In a statement on Sunday, Gehlot said Captain Singh had himself admitted that he was made the chief minister for nineand-a-half years by the party and had served the people of Punjab to the best of his capabilities. “Captain Sahab is an honourable leader and I believe that he will continue to keep the interest of the party above everything,” said Gehlot. Captain Singh resigned along with his council of ministers over differences with Punjab Congress chief Navjyot Singh Sidhu on Saturday. The party didn’t stop him from resigning. Gehlot said, “On several occasions, the high command has to react and respond according to the feedback from the MLAs and commoners in the interest of the party.” While defending the party’s high command move, Gehlot said, “I personally feel that Congress president chose the CM candidate from the pool of many who are in the race for the top post. The president even faces resentment from those not chosen for the post. But the same CM called out the high command for replacing him/her. During such a moment one should hear the internal voice,” said Gehlot. Urging the Congress to stand united, he said “I believe that fascist forces are leading the country towards a direction which gives more responsibility to the Congressman to serve the nation. We have to rise above everything and have to think about the party and the nation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/hope-captain-amrinder-singh-will-continue-working-in-congress-interest-rajasthan-cm/articleshow/86356389.cms||---
---||Business||Cos get relief from GST Council's clarifications||NEW DELHI: Two clarifications issued by the GST Council on Friday are expected to provide major relief to businesses - captives of overseas companies in India that cater to other foreign businesses of their parents as well as Indian entities such as telecom outfits, insurers and banks that have operations across several states. At its Lucknow meeting, the Council comprising union and state finance ministers decided to allow unutilised balance in CGST and IGST cash ledger to be transferred between distinct persons (entities having same PAN but registered in different states), without going through the refund procedure. Tax practitioners said, this will be a major relief for businesses as an insurance company, which needs separate registration across states and union territories, can now use the unclaimed credit say, in UP, for meeting its liability in Maharashtra. While in the European Union even group companies can use the credit, the facility is limited to the same company in India. So, a conglomerate in India will not be able to use the credit available with its auto company for insurance company, the insurance company can use the credit across states. "Businesses having multi-state operations will now be relieved that they are permitted to transfer the unutilised balance of credits across the states where they operate, making the working capital management more efficient," said M S Mani, senior director at consulting firm Deloitte. The other relief will benefit captive businesses of multinationals, such as Citibank or Standard Chartered, which use their India facility for transactions in the US or the UK. A ruling had made life tough for these entities, arguing that they will have to pay 18% GST on services rendered to entities outside India. While the Central Board and Excise and Indirect Taxes had issued a clarification, the issue could not be resolved. "The government has proposed to issue clarification on some of the crucial areas of disputes like intermediary services, which is going to be highly relevant for resolving conflicts for BPOs, other backend global offices, etc and put an end to unnecessary litigations," said Abhishek Jain, tax partner at EY India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/cos-get-relief-from-gst-councils-clarifications/articleshow/86356468.cms||Sidhartha

Amid reports that a consensus had possibly emerged on the name of outgoing corporation minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, a large number of his supporters, including MLAs, thronged his residence. However, it soon turned out to be a long delay for an official announcement for them. Earlier in the day, Congress leader Ambika Soni, who was called in for a late night meeting with Rahul Gandhi, declined the offer to become the Punjab chief minister. Soni’s statement came amid deliberations that had the name of Sunil Jakhar, a prominent face of the party, as a possible choice. However, there were reports of a section of leaders insisting that the new CM should only be a Sikh and also an MLA. Many Congress legislators, including Satkar Kaur, had even gone to greet Jakhar in the morning but the scenario changed quickly. Channi came as surprise entryInterestingly, the final choice of the party — Charanjit Singh Channi was not in the list of probables doing the rounds and came as a surprise entry. With no consensus on the new CM face through the day, the meeting of the Congress Legislature Party scheduled at 11am had to be deferred.

The boy suffered severe injuries all over the body, police said, adding that three people including a minor have been detained for questioning in this connection. The nine-year-old student of a government school, a police officer said, was a resident of a quiet locality in Maduravoyal and sold snacks near a theatre in the neighbourhood in the evening. On Saturday evening, he went to his usual spot to do business but did not return home. His family members panicked and lodged a complaint at the Maduravoyal police station. A special team after a search found him under the Maduravoyal flyover with serious injuries and rushed him to the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital. After doctors provided initial treatment, the boy regained consciousness and told investigators that four men including a minor came to the spot where he stood on two two-wheelers and offered to buy all his snacks if he would go with them. “He accompanied them thinking that he could sell the snacks immediately and return home,” said an officer. They, however, took him to an isolated place where the men tried to force him into homosexual activities. The boy panicked and began to cry out for help when they gagged him. The boy continued to resist when the men gave up their attempt and began to hurl stones at him and beat him with logs they found on the roadside, the officer said. The four then left him for dead and sped away on their vehicles. The boy managed to crawl underneath the flyover where the police team found him. After looking through footage from CCTV cameras at the spot, police picked up a minor and two others for questioning. A preliminary probe revealed that the gang members had been under the influence of ganja when they targeted the boy. Police said the gang may have been involved in snatching and robbery cases after taking ganja and are probing to find out if the boy was their first target or if the gang members tried to sexually assaulted other children too. The boy’s family had been struggling to make ends meet since the onset of the pandemic and he had been sent to sell snacks to augment the income. The latest National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) report shows 1.28 lakh cases of crimes against children were registered across India in 2020 and that 640 of the victims were below six years and 2,540 between 6 and 12 years.

It may be easy to win Lok Sabha elections but in the state, we cannot bank only on that. We must reach out to people with development work,” he said on Sunday. At the state executive meeting here, he said the litmus test is to win the Hangal and Sindagi bypolls. “We know what will be the message if we lose these elections. We shouldn’t think these will be easy wins. The opposition is strong and we should give due credit to them and their calculations,” he said, adding that the next two years are packed with elections. “No doubt BJP will retain power at the Centre after the 2024 Lok Sabha polls under Modi’s leadership. However, one must strengthen the party to ensure success in all elections. We should take leaders of the SC, ST and other backward communities into confidence and form teams of youths and women at the booth level,” he added. He said: “We’ve learnt that KPCC president DK Shivakumar has contacted two of our MLAs. I told workers to be cautious as Congress leaders are actively seeking power and warned them not to underestimate opponents.” Later, chief minister Basavaraj Bommai praised Yediyurappa and credited the four-time CM for BJP coming to power for the second time in 10 years. Will protect religious sentiments: BommaiChief minister Basavaraj Bommai said the government will protect religious sentiments of people. On the Nanjangud temple demolition, he said there are efforts to disturb law and order through misinformation campaigns on social media. “We have successfully tackled them. We take such incidents very seriously and will initiate legal action,” he said. Yediyurappa said the party cadre need not worry about the demolition as it’s an isolated incident and the government will ensure it’s not repeated. Govt seeks three textile parks in KarnatakaThe state has submitted a proposal to the Centre to create a minimum of three textile parks, said chief minister Basavaraj Bommai. Laying the foundation stone for development works under Mahatma Gandhi Nagar Vikas Yojana on Sunday, Bommai said the government has launched works worth Rs 125 crore and will take up works at the cost of Rs 1,500 crore. “The Centre is encouraging textile and automobile industries. We’ve planned programmes under the Amrut Gram scheme and are sanctioning funds of Rs 25 lakh to each gram panchayat for development works,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/modi-wave-alone-will-not-help-bjpwin-local-elections-in-ktaka-bsy/articleshow/86351706.cms||---
---||Ludhiana||Charanjit Singh Channi elevation: Impact of Dalit CM in Punjab is not as linear as it appears||JALANDHAR: Charanjit Singh Channi will make history by becoming the first Dalit chief minister of Punjab, but the political impact of his appointment may not be linear as the Dalits in Punjab have remained politically divided on caste lines even as they constitute almost one-third of the population. The narrative of having a Dalit CM in Punjab was started by the BJP in April this year on the occasion of the Ambedkar Jayanti even though the party does not have a strong base among them as yet and the Congress has now walked on the path. The decision may blunt the BJP’s attempt to play the Dalit card. It may also make the job tougher for the Shiromani Akali Dal-BSP alliance as the latter remains a party largely of one caste – Adi-dharmi/Ravidassia community and Channi belongs to the same caste. However, this same factor can complicate the situation for Congress. The two largest Scheduled Caste communities, Mazhabi Sikh/Valmiki and Ravidassia/Adi-dharmi have been competing with each other in political space. For instance, despite attempts by BSP founder Kanshi Ram to unite them under one single Dalit identity, he could not make the BSP a party of all Dalits, and Mazhabi Sikhs/Valmikis have largely stayed away from it. While Channi can be a positive factor in Ravidassia/ Adidharmi community, at the same time this can lead to competitive voices among Mazhabi Sikhs, who are the biggest community among the Scheduled Castes in Punjab, and the opposition parties can also attempt to work on them. Valmikis, who are largely urban-based and have a Hindu identity, have largely remained with the Congress while Akali Dal has managed to make some inroads among them. Mazhabi Sikhs are largely rural-based and they have been aligned with Akali Dal and Congress. At the same time, how the Jat Sikhs, who remain the single largest caste/community as their population is estimated to be around 25% even as BJP insists they are around 18%, view the elevation of a Dalit leader as the CM would also be a factor. They along with other Sikhs played a very significant role for Congress in the 2017 assembly and 2019 parliamentary elections and even the recent PEW survey confirmed the latter part. How the proposition of removing the Dalit CM, after winning the 2022 assembly election, would work also remains unpredictable.

The accused, a former functionary of the DMK, has been sentenced to life imprisonment. The court had earlier convicted an advocate and two others and sentenced them to life imprisonment too. According to the prosecution, on December 25, 2005, the deceased Tamilselvan was walking back home when the accused including Poyyamozhi, then president of Ullikottai panchayat, attacked him.

The incident took place after the suspects found out the man and woman belonged to different communities and followed the bike before intercepting it. Police said the woman had been awarded the best employee of her company on Friday. Since it was late evening, she had informed her husband that she would ask her colleague, also a family friend, to drop her home. The suspects slapped the biker and abused the woman for taking lift from a man belonging to another community. A video of the assault has gone viral. Duo nabbed within 12 hours  The woman and her colleague left their office in Richmond Circle area and were on the way to their residences when the incident took place. The suspects made the woman get down from the bike and promised her they would hire an auto for her. One of the suspects grabbed the mobile number of the woman’s husband and called him. He abused her husband for allowing his wife to travel with other men. A special team formed by Srinath Mahadev Joshi, deputy commissioner of police (southeast), identified the victims, took up a case and arrested the duo within 12 hours .

---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: When pandemic came, recovery of stolen items plunged to a new low||CHANDIGARH: The police were able to recover only 26.8% of stolen properties like cash, gold, silver ornaments and vehicles in 2020 as compared to 39.4% in 2019 and 35.5% in 2018, according to National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data. Cops blamed coronavirus pandemic for their poor showing. “Owing to the initial lockdowns, maximum force was occupied in implementing the guidelines in the city. We were unable to investigate burglary and theft cases,” said a police official. The data pointed out that thieves stole property items worth Rs 6.9 crore, while cops managed to get back items worth Rs 1.9 crore last year. Similarly, in 2019, Rs 7.6 crore goods were stolen and those worth Rs 3 crore recovered. In 2018, miscreants stole Rs 9.9 crore items, while police recovered property worth Rs 3.5 crore. Recovering all the stolen items, be it cash, or vehicles is almost impractical. “Most of the vehicles recovered were in dismantled condition. In cheating, or fraud cases, despite arresting the accused, the recovery of cash was not possible in many instances,” said cops. Police said they had arrested most of the burglars but failed to recover stolen ornaments as they had sold items like jewellery in other states. “When we catch them, the jewellers had already melted ornaments in other form to evade arrest,” said a cop. But one of the outcomes of the Covid outbreak was that theft cases dropped last year. As many 78 burglaries, 23 robberies, 418 vehicle thefts and 196 others thefts were registered in the 16 police stations in 2020. In 2019, 125 burglaries, 33 robberies, 616 vehicle thefts and 292 other thefts were reported. And, in 2018, 182 burglaries, 58 robberies and 1,028 vehicle and other thefts were reported. Similar, the city reported an 18% dip in registration of cases under Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Special Local Laws (SLL) in 2020 as compared to 2019. Last year, the 16 police stations had registered 2,583 cases under sections of the IPC as compared to 2,819 in 2019. Data showed 671 cases were registered under sections of the SLL in 2020 as compared to 1,699 in 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/chandigarh-when-pandemic-came-recovery-of-stolen-items-plunged-to-a-new-low/articleshow/86356609.cms||Pawan Tiwari

The draft was submitted to the civic body last month by the Institute of Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP). The GCC has sent it back suggesting some changes. “We await ITDP’s response to our suggestions, after which we will implement it,” deputy commissioner, works department, M S Prasanth told TOI. The goals of the World Bank funded Chennai parking policy, ITDP’s Ashwathi Dilip said, include reducing demand for parking through management and pricing, reclaiming on-street parking spaces for sustainable transport modes, encouraging shift to public transport, walking, and cycling. By this, it hopes to minimise traffic congestion, air pollution and accidents, and improve economic vitality. Aiming for a professionally operated system, the civic body. Based on demand, more infrastructure such as multilevel car parks would be planned. The one at T Nagar is yet to take off as people haven't been using it to capacity. In a commercial area, shop owners and employees use most of the available parking space on the streets for the whole day. In residential areas, these spaces are used to park at nights. “This street infrastructure cannot be used to build pedestrian footpaths and other infrastructure.

Samastha president Syed Jiffri Muthukoya Thangal told a news conference that the developments after the bishop’s statement have brought up a suspicion whether people in responsible positions are encouraging such remarks as some ministers were seen visiting them and exalting them as revered and righteous. Govt should not encourage such remarks: ThangalThere is nothing wrong in that as bishops are very important people and they can be considered as revered. But the government should not act as if encouraging such remarks. That would amount to hurting the other section,” he said. Thangal was referring to cooperatives minister V N Vasavan calling on Pala bishop on Friday. The minister had told reporters after the meeting that the bishop was a “scholarly person” and “terrorists” were trying to stir up a controversy over his narcotic jihad remark. Sunni leader Kanthapuram A P Aboobacker Musaliyar, who heads the AP faction of Sunni scholars, meanwhile, said the bishop should withdraw the controversial statement. Thangal said if anyone felt that there was a narcotic jihad, they should have informed about it to the government rather than making a public statement. “Such remarks are not expected from religious leaders who should foster religious amity. Also, when such a statement comes from a bishop, the government should not justify it,” he said. Responding to a question, he said it is not clear if Vasavan had visited the bishop as a representative of the government. It is up to the chief minister to spell out the stand on the matter, he said. Thangal said there is nothing called "love jihad" or “narcotic jihad” in Islam and there is no jihad in Islam religious conversion. “Love is a natural thing to happen for humans. It does not have any religion. Muslims don’t have any such agenda (of love jihad). Islam does not have a jihad to convert people. Samastha runs over 10,000 madrasas and there is no mention about any such jihad in any of our textbooks,” he said. Kanthapuram A P Aboobacker Musaliyar said what was needed was not mediation talks but withdrawal of the false statement made about Muslim community by those who made it.

Apart from emerging as a strong detractor of Capt Amarinder Singh since April this year, Channi has also been dogged by a series of controversies during his stint as the technical education minister since 2017. He had also attended what is believed to be the first ‘secret meeting’ between Navjot Singh Sidhu and other dissident leaders like Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, marking the start of regrouping in the Punjab Congress. A relatively young leader and a Dalit Sikh, Channi was picked by the party high command for the post of leader of opposition (LoP) in 2015 to replace Sunil Jakhar during the previous Akali regime. Those close to Channi say that he was not too happy with the technical education portfolio in Amarinder’s cabinet as it is usually an add-on with major departments. He has also been vocal about the need to resolve the pending issues of the SC community in the state. During the initial period of the Congress regime, Channi was in the spotlight for his strong belief in astrology, and it is said that on the advice of an astrologer to have an eastfacing entry to his house, he illegally constructed a road from a park outside his official residence in Sector 2, Chandigarh. The move was objected to by the Chandigarh administration. Later, on his astrologer’s advice, Channi rode an elephant in the lawns of his house in Kharar. The Chamkaur Sahib MLA has a host of degrees. After studying law, in 2007, he enrolled in an MBA programme at the Punjab Technical University. He also completed masters in political science in 2009 and then decided to get a doctorate on the history of the Indian National Congress. He even took the entrance test to start his PhD but failed to clear. However, later Panjab University authorities allegedly relaxed norms and slashed passing marks for SC/ST students. In 2018, Channi was in the news for flipping a coin to decide on the right candidate, out of two nominees, for the post of a lecturer in a polytechnic institute. A government spokesperson had sought to clarify that the minister’s intention was to allot the posts in a transparent manner after a video clip of his “toss” act went viral on social media. ‘Inappropriate texts’ to woman officerChanni had also hit the headlines with an alleged #MeToo case after he was accused of sending inappropriate text message to a woman IAS officer in 2018. The officer never filed a complaint and it was claimed that the issue was resolved. But the issue had resurfaced when the Punjab Women’s Commission sent notice to the state government asking for its response to the allegation.

---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Stuck on muddy road, woman dies at childbirth in Chhatarpur||BHOPAL: A woman in labour died in a village in MP’s Chhatarpur district on Saturday because bad roads prevented her from reaching a hospital in time. Villagers tried to ferry her through calf-deep mud in a tractor but she died on the way after giving birth to a baby. A 108 ambulance responded to their SOS but couldn’t make it through the mud. Like many neighbouring villages, Rajapurwa – 60km from the district headquarters -- is surrounded by muddy paths. The mud track to ward number 8 in Rajapurwa village is so terrible that it is tough to get across on foot. Gomti Rai, 38, lived on this inaccessible ‘island’. She went into labour around 4pm on Saturday. Villagers called 108 but the ambulance driver said he couldn’t reach her home because of the mud. “She was writhing in pain. We decided to take her on a tractor, but it too got stuck in the mud,” said Devkinandan, a villager. Locals were desperately trying to get the tractor wheels unstuck when she delivered the baby and died. Her death sparked anger in the area, and the tremors reached the administration. Acknowledging the woman’s death, Ajay Agnihotri, chief municipal officer of Chandla Nagar panchayat, said: “It (Rajapurwa) is a rural area and was included in the nagar panchayat recently. We have already sanctioned road projects for the village.” Roads will be built on priority, he said. Last month, visuals of people carrying an ailing villager on a cot on their shoulders, as they struggled through muddy paths in Purwa village of the same district, had gone viral. This village of 600 is around 25km west of Rajapurwa. Residents here have been demanding roads for 50 years but their voice is yet to be heard by successive governments. The local MLA from Chandla, Rajesh Prajapati, had a taste of these bad roads on August 14 when he was invited to inaugurate a school in Hirdepurwa but couldn’t reach the village. His SUV got stuck in the mud on the outskirts of the village. Locals summoned a tractor, and the MLA boarded it, but the tractor too got stuck in the mud.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-stuck-on-muddy-road-woman-dies-at-childbirth-in-chhatarpur/articleshow/86356499.cms||---

Apart from the buzz surrounding Banerjee contesting the bypoll following her loss in Nandigram, what is making the contest more interesting is the battle of minnows. While some claim to be fighting just for fun, others claim to be fighting to bring in a change. Also, there are a couple of dummy candidates, as per party sources. "I'm contesting the polls to gain some fame which will help me in continuing my social work," said Ruma Nandan, who sells pickles and manages a self-help group. Subrata Bose and Malay Guha Roy, in their 60s and 50s respectively, claimed they were fighting just for fun. In their social media profiles, both were found sharing schemes and programmes of TMC. "I had contested in Nandigram as well and garnered 77 votes. I had enjoyed the fun and popularity I received even at a place no one knows me," said Bose, a financial consultant. But at least one independent candidate and two other candidates representing smaller parties vow to pose a tough challenge. "I'm here to fight against corruption and post-poll violence," said Chandrachur Goswami (32), a gold medallist in environmental studies and classical music. Swarnalata Sarkar, a yoga trainer representing three-year-old Bharatiya Nyay Adhikar Raksha Party and stationary shop owner Mangal Sarkar from Bahujan Maha Party are also in the race to "bring a change". Satadru Roy, principal of a private school in Kolkata, is also contesting the election.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/yoga-trainer-pickle-seller-among-11-to-take-on-mamata-in-bypoll/articleshow/86356796.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Sample this: With 0 flights in April 2020 after first lockdown was imposed the Bhopal’s Raja Bhopal airport has touched 560 flights movements in August 2021. Same was true with the passengers’ footfall also. This could be gauged from the fact that in April 2020 the footfall was 0, while it touched 64,112 in August 2021. In spite of the lethal second Covid wave that swept the city in April and May this year, Bhopal airport managed to continue its services to a great extent. Comparing 2020, the year 2021 has witnessed better footfall and flight movements. In December 2020, movements of 584 flights were recorded. Bhopal airport went close to that figure even by August 2021 as 560 flights movements were recorded in August 2021. In the passenger footfall also, there was a steep rise. In 2020, the passenger footfall was around 66,808. In August 2021, the passenger footfall was 64,112 which was close to December 2020 figure. When contacted, Bhopal airport director KL Aggarwal said that Bhopal has potential to grow. “Figures of the past two years are enough to gauge the level of potential Bhopal has. We will keep growing and are expecting that more cities will be connected with Bhopal airport in the near future,” said Aggarwal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/as-covid-numbers-dip-bhopal-airport-takes-wing/articleshow/86356501.cms||Ramendra Singh

The civic body says it has conducted multiple surveys and taken up measures to prevent waterlogging in all critical areas of the city. But residents of the low-lying areas still have to face the problem of waterlogging after incessant rain. Residents of Chandrabhaga, Indira Pratima, Pardeshipura, Palhar Nagar and Bhagirathpura, among others have complained of severe waterlogging. In view of the increasing complaints of waterlogging, the civic body has announced a fresh survey to identify critical areas. IMC officials also said that rectification work in all affected areas will be started on a priority basis. Residents, however, have alleged ignorance on part of IMC. “We had been facing waterlogging problem for the past many years owing to encroachment. But nothing concrete has been done by IMC to address the issue,” said a resident of Bhagirathpura area. Illegal constructions and encroachment were found to be posing obstructions in flow of rainwater, leading to waterlogging. IMC, however, said waterlogging issue in many areas had been resolved. “Work on addressing the problem in a few residential areas is in progress and will be completed soon,” said IMC additional commissioner Sandeep Soni.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/waterlogging-woes-indore-municipal-corporation-to-identify-critical-areas/articleshow/86356555.cms||---

Blaming the state government for not taking any steps to bring the two sides to a discussion table despite repeated requests by the opposition leader, Sudhakaran said KPCC would convene a joint meeting of religious leaders to find an amicable resolution to the issue. He said the talks held by Congress with various Muslim and Christian religious leaders have been very positive as none of the leaders want the issue to exacerbate further or to damage the communal harmony in the state. Sudhakaran said that cooperative minister V M Vasavan had responded in an irresponsible manner after visiting Pala bishop. “The minister had said there was no need to hold talks since there were no issues. The government did not display the composure or responsibility expected of it in addressing the problem," Sudhakaran added. Satheesan said the state government was remaining a mute spectator when an unprecedented hate campaign was going on through social media aimed at wrecking the secular fabric in the state. “No other state or any other government would allow such vicious campaigns which would spark off communal discord to continue. I had even forwarded a link of an online media which had offensive content to the cyber cell to take action. Some individuals are creating fake social media accounts both in the name of Christians and Muslims and engaging in hate campaign which would inflame people belonging to both communities," he added. Satheesan reiterated that the state government has no stand on the matter and said that people connected with the government were visiting various persons and making statements that suited them. "Is it proper during mediation to visit persons on both the sides and make statements that would make them happy," Satheesan asked. He said that the stand by the state government has given rise to suspicion that it wants the conflict between the two communities to prolong a bit more. Sudhakaran said the opposition leader had written to the CM urging the government to carry out its responsibility to initiate steps to convene talks to resolve the issue, but the CM did not respond positively. "The apathy shown by the chief minister in this regard is an injustice towards the society," he said. Sudhakaran added that KPCC will observe this year's Gandhi Jayanthi day as social harmony day and the state wide inauguration of the programme would be held in Kozhikode on October 2. The Congress leaders met various religious leaders including Samastha Kerala Jem Iyyathul Ulema president Syed Jiffri Muthukoya Thangal, Sunni leader Kanthapuram A P Aboobacker Musaliyar, KNM leaders, T P Abdullakoya Madani and Hussain Madavoor and Kozhikode bishop Varghese Chakkalakkal. Opposition leader V D Satheesan had held talks with Thamarassery bishop Remigiose Inchananiyil on Saturday night.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/congress-to-convene-meeting-of-religious-leaders-to-fix-row-in-kozhikode/articleshow/86356686.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||HC notice to Yamunanagar police on ITBP IG’s plea||Chandigarh: The Punjab and Haryana high court has issued notice to Yamunanagar district police on a plea filed by an inspector general of police (IG) of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) apprehending his arrest in a case of criminal trespass registered against him in relation to a property dispute. “This petition has been filed for directions to the official respondents (SP Yamunanagar and other cops) to give at least 15 days’ prior notice to the petitioner before making his arrest in case bearing FIR No 543 dated July 11, 2021 registered under Sections 427, 447, 506 and 511 IPC at police station city Yamunanagar,” observed the HC, while seeking reply from the district police. The matter has been fixed for November 10 for further hearing. Justice Harnaresh Singh Gill passed these orders while hearing a petition filed by ITBP IG S B Sharma, who is posted as director of the mountaineering and skiing institute at Auli, Joshimath in Uttrakhand. A native of Yamunanagar in Haryana, Sharma has stated that Pushpa Sharma, his mother-in-law’s sister, is unmarried and he has been taking care of her in her old age. According to the petitioner, he was booked on July 11 by Yamunanagar police for trespassing on the property owned by Pushpa Sharma. The complainants are her nephew’s family members but they do not have any legal right in the property. The HC has been informed that even Pushpa has registered the power of attorney related to the house in his favour. Petitioner has submitted that despite joining the investigation on July 23 and 24 in the FIR, he has not been permitted to be joined by the investigating officer (IO) of the case ASI Dal Singh. Petitioner has sought directions that he should be given at least 15-days prior notice to the petition before making arrest to enable him to get recourse to the legal remedies available to him. Further directions have also been sought to direct the Yamunanagar police to join the petitioner with investigation and to enlarge him on bail after taking appropriate bail bonds/surety as all offences in FIR are bailable. Counsel for the petitioner, Gagandeep Singh Wasu, argued that petitioner has already appeared twice before the investigating officer of the case but deliberately not making the petitioner formally join the investigation due to ulterior reasons best known to him, thereby violating the petitioner’s constitutional and statutory rights. “The petitioner is a decorated police officer with an unblemished and untarnished long service record of 34 years and has received various police medals and commemoration certificates, including presidential police medal for meritorious service in 2019. The petitioner has also served at various sensitive areas like the anti-naxal operations at Chhatisgarh and anti-militancy operations at Jammu and Kashmir. Thus in view of the work and responsibilities of the petitioner, he is entitled for the protection from unnecessary and unwarranted arrest in the mentioned false FIR,” counsel had submitted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/hc-notice-to-yamunanagar-police-on-itbp-igs-plea/articleshow/86354396.cms||---
---||World||Pro-Kremlin party on track for majority after crackdown||MOSCOW: President Vladimir Putin's United Russia party was on track to win a strong majority in a parliamentary vote, results showed Monday, after an election that followed an unprecedented crackdown on the opposition. With 50 percent of votes counted, United Russia was ahead with 46.11 percent of the vote, followed by the Communist Party with 21.40 percent. The vote came in the wake of a clampdown that saw Putin's best-known domestic foe Alexei Navalny jailed -- after he returned to Russia following a poisoning he blames on the Kremlin -- and his organisations banned as "extremist". In the lead-up to the election, all of Navalny's top allies were arrested or fled the country, with anyone associated with his groups kept from running. Navalny's team had called for opposition supporters to back other candidates who could potentially defeat United Russia, most of them from the Communists, and results indicated the "Smart Voting" campaign may have had some success. United Russia's share of the vote was down from 54.2 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, while the Communists saw their support grow from 13.3 percent. Voting by party list accounts for only half of the lower house State Duma's 450 seats, however, and United Russia was dominating in the other half of seats assigned according to single-mandate races. With 50 percent of those votes counted, United Russia candidates were ahead in at least 193 of the 225 seats. United Russia held 334 Duma seats going into the election and if the trends continued it appeared likely to at least hold on to a two-thirds majority. Three other parties appeared to have met the five percent threshold needed to enter parliament -- the nationalist LDPR, the recently formed "New People" party, and "A Just Russia", all with less than 10 percent. United Russia's general council secretary Andrei Turchak congratulated supporters at party headquarters on a "clean and honest victory". But Navalny's allies said the vote was being falsified on a massive scale, pointing especially to repeated delays in releasing the results of electronic voting in liberal and opposition-friendly Moscow. "We have rattled their political system. We forced them to either admit defeat or to falsify, in front of everyone, absolutely brazenly, without any shame. To admit moral bankruptcy," key Navalny aide Leonid Volkov said during a live stream on YouTube. Authorities had taken drastic measures to deter the "Smart Voting" campaign, which provided lists of candidates with the best hope of denying Kremlin-aligned politicians a seat. The campaign's website was shut down and on Friday Apple and Google removed the Smart Voting app from their stores, causing an uproar among the opposition who accused them of giving in to Kremlin "blackmail". Sources familiar with Google and Apple's decision told AFP the move was taken under pressure from Russian authorities, including threats to arrest the tech giants' local staff. The popular Telegram messenger also removed Navalny's Smart Voting bot, and on Sunday Google Docs and YouTube videos containing the lists of recommended candidates were blocked. Turnout was at 45 percent according to the latest figures released by the election commission on Sunday. Critics had argued that online voting, new limits on election observers and the polls being spread over three days -- a move officials said was to reduce coronavirus risks -- all presented opportunities for fraud. As of Sunday evening, independent election monitor Golos -- which authorities branded a "foreign agent" ahead of the polls -- had tracked over 4,900 reports of voting violations. While 68-year-old Putin remains popular, United Russia has seen its support drop as living standards decline following years of economic stagnation. "There is no one to vote for," Andrei, a 33-year-old IT professional who declined to give his last name, told AFP in Moscow. He cast his ballot in the "sham" elections, he said, to "at least show some kind of protest against the current government". But Anna Kartashova, a 50-year-old pharmaceutical company manager in Moscow, said she voted for United Russia because she "simply trusts" Putin. "We just don't see anyone else we can trust in the current political landscape," she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/pro-kremlin-party-on-track-for-majority-after-crackdown/articleshow/86356895.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Online transfer system is a laudable step to bring transparency: HC||Chandigarh: The Punjab and Haryana high court has observed that the online transfer system is a laudable step to bring transparency in the administrative functioning. The HC has passed these orders while dismissing a petition filed by some Veterinary Livestock Development Assistants (VLDAs) serving in the department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying Haryana. "Merely because the petitioners have been asked to participate in the online transfer drive is no ground for this court to grant any indulgence. On the other hand, introducing online transfer drives is a laudable step to bring about better transparency in the administrative functioning," observed Justice Arun Monga of the HC. The judge was also of the view that transfer being a matter of administrative exigency, this court generally refrains to interfere and treads cautiously. It is a settled position that transfer is an integral part of the service conditions. Moreover transfer is not a punishment but an essential aspect of service, particularly, on a transferable post, the judge had held. Justice Arun Monga of the HC has passed these orders while dismissing a petition filed by Sunil Verma, a resident of Hisar district and others serving as VLDA in the department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying Haryana. Their main grievance was that they had recently joined their current place of posting but through an order dated August 16, they have been directed to participate in the online transfer drive introduced by the state government for carrying out general transfers. After finding no merit in their contentions the HC ordered to dismiss their plea with cost. However, taking some lenient view on request from their counsel, the judge ordered that the petitioners shall collectively plant 25 trees of deciduous and perennial in nature, of any variety like Neem, Amla, Gulmohar or Alstonia, in the vicinity where they have been transferred. Plantation shall be carried out under the supervision of the concerned district horticulture officer. The officer of the horticulture department has also been directed to give a letter of proof of having carried out the plantation of the trees as per the orders of this court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/online-transfer-system-is-a-laudable-step-to-bring-transparency-hc/articleshow/86354416.cms||Ajay Sura

HDFC said July disbursements were the highest ever in a non-quarter end month. "Growth in home loans came from both the affordable housing segment as well as high-end properties," its MD Renu Sud Karnad said. "Pandemic has reinvigorated the importance of home ownership. The concept of work-from-home is also fuelling the need and creating a demand for larger spaces as a subset," says Y Viswanatha Gowd, MD and CEO of LIC Housing Finance. Shriram Housing Finance disbursed more fresh home loans to touch Rs 650-700 crore mark in July-September, 2021 from Rs 220 crore in the April-June quarter. Its MD & CEO Ravi Subramanian says, "We have already reached the pre-Covid levels of disbursement of loans." In August, M&M Finance recorded a 57% YoY growth in disbursement at Rs 2,150 crore. Indiabulls Housing Finance said fresh loan disbursements have picked up pace from July, registering impressive growth month-on-month. In August, it disbursed about Rs 550 cr of retail loans and expected to disburse about Rs 750 Cr of retail loans in September.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/fresh-loans-by-nbfcs-reach-pre-covid-levels/articleshow/86356932.cms||Mamtha Asokan
---||World||California firefighters scramble to protect sequoia groves||THREE RIVERS, California: Hot, dry weather on Sunday added to the challenges facing California firefighters battling to keep flames from driving further into a grove of ancient sequoias, where the base of the world's largest tree has been wrapped in protective foil. Meanwhile, flames had reached the giant trees in another grove. Fire officials warned that stronger winds were also contributing to ``critical fire conditions'' in the area of the KNP Complex, two lightning-sparked blazes that merged on the western side of Sequoia National Park in the Sierra Nevada. The National Weather Service issued a red flag warning through Sunday, saying gusts and lower humidity could create conditions for rapid wildfire spread. The fires forced the evacuation of the park last week, along with parts of Three Rivers, a foothill town of about 2,500 people. Firefighters using bulldozers expanded a line between the fire and the community, fire spokesperson Rebecca Paterson said Sunday. More than 34 square miles (88 square kilometers) of forest land have been blackened. The National Park Service said Friday that fire had reached the westernmost tip of the Giant Forest, where it scorched a grouping of sequoias known as the ``Four Guardsmen'' that mark the entrance to the grove of 2,000 sequoias. Since then crews have managed to keep the flames from encroaching further into the area. ``The fire perimeter kind of wraps around the Giant Forest at this point,`` Paterson said. Firefighters swaddled the base of the General Sherman Tree, along with other trees in the Giant Forest, in a type of aluminum that can withstand high heat. The General Sherman Tree is the largest in the world by volume, at 52,508 cubic feet (1,487 cubic meters), according to the National Park Service. It towers 275 feet (84 meters) high and has a circumference of 103 feet (31 meters) at ground level. Firefighters who were wrapping the base of the sequoias in foil and sweeping leaves and needles from the forest floor around the trees had to flee from the danger, fire spokesperson Katy Hooper said Saturday. They returned when conditions improved to continue the work and start a strategic fire along Generals Highway to protect the Giant Forest grove, she said. Giant sequoias are adapted to fire, which can help them thrive by releasing seeds from their cones and creating clearings that allow young sequoias to grow. But the extraordinary intensity of fires _ fueled by climate change _ can overwhelm the trees. ``Once you get fire burning inside the tree, that will result in mortality,'' said Jon Wallace, the operations section chief for the KNP Complex. The fires already have burned into several groves containing trees as tall as 200 feet (61 meters) feet tall and 2,000 years old. To the south, the Windy Fire grew to 28 square miles (72 square kilometers) on the Tule River Indian Reservation and in Giant Sequoia National Monument, where it has burned into the Peyrone grove of sequoias and threatens others. The fire also had reached Long Meadow Grove, where the Trail of 100 Giant Sequoias is a national monument. Fire officials haven't yet been able to determine how much damage was done to the groves, which are in remote and hard-to-reach areas. However, active flames were seen by an Associated Press photographer burning up the trunk and the forest floor below it was ablaze. Historic drought tied to climate change is making wildfires harder to fight. It has killed millions of trees in California alone. Scientists say climate change has made the West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive. More than 7,000 wildfires in California this year have damaged or destroyed more than 3,000 homes and other buildings and torched well over 3,000 square miles (7,770 square kilometers) of land, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/california-firefighters-scramble-to-protect-sequoia-groves/articleshow/86356933.cms||---

Wearing masks and maintaining at least a gap of at least six feet, children in primary sections will head back to campuses after a year and a half. While the schools are prepared to welcome back the students, many parents are still unsure about giving consent for offline classes. As many as 534 government schools in Gurugram have updated the thermal scanning and hand sanitisation facilities at their campuses. According to officials, students and teachers will be scanned for temperature, the records of which will be updated on the Avsar app. Officials added that students will sit on alternate desks and only one child will be allowed per desk. All such measures, however, will be in place only once the parents have given their written consent letter allowing their children to attend physical classes. On facilities for the primary school students, district project coordinator Kalpana Ranga said more taps have been installed in government schools to inculcate the habit of washing hands with soap. “These students are very young. Parents have regularly raised concern that the children don’t know how to properly use a sanitiser. We will make sure that they wash their hands every time they step out of the class.” Furthermore, mid-day meals will not be given in the backdrop of the situation and students will be prohibited to share food, water and books. In addition, preference will be given to classes in an open space and not in the classrooms. “All rules will be scrupulously adhered to and we anticipate a large turnout,” said Manoj Kumar Larka, elementary headmaster at Government Senior School in Bajghera. However, some parents TOI spoke to expressed concern as children are still not vaccinated. They said they were unsure whether they should send their kids back to schools or not. “They are young and don’t understand things easily. It is difficult to make a decision. They have been at home for a long time and we want them to interact, but at what cost?” said Anita Rani, whose daughter is a Class 2 student. Officials, on their part, have been trying to reassure the parents. “I am getting calls from parents regarding their concerns. We have assured them that Covid norms will be in place and they need not worry,” said Kalpana. Meanwhile, private schools are also keen to resume classes. DPS School in Sector 45 has received consent from 120 parents. “We have sent the online forms to the parents and many of them want to send their children back to school. We are preparing to resume primary classes by Wednesday,” said Aditi Mishra, principal of the school.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/schools-open-for-classes-1-3-today-parents-raise-concern/articleshow/86352775.cms||Sagrika Kissu

Both the leaders were able to take whatever stand they deem fit for the situation. The only politician who is adept at practising such a style of functioning after K Karunakaran is Pinarayi Vijayan,” Muraleedharan said while speaking at a leadership camp organized by District Congress Committee. Muraleedharan said Congress party should maintain a warmer relationship with all community organisations. “If we need to win the political battle, we need sharper weapons. To defeat the opponent, we first need to work as a single team. If we can fight together, victory would be ours. There is no doubt about it,” Muraleedharan said. Taking a dig at CPM, Muraleedharan said some Marxist leaders were not bothered about BJP’s efforts to make inroads into Kerala politics.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/inclusive-politics-kerala-cm-pinarayi-vijayan-gets-congress-leader-k-muraleedharans-pat/articleshow/86356884.cms||---

They have been directed to follow strict Covid-appropriate behaviour and adhere to requisite social distancing within campuses. The residential universities, however, have been directed to continue with online classes till October 15 and a decision on the physical classes will be taken after taking stock of the situation. Dr Padmakali Banerjee, the pro-vice-chancellor of Amity University, said: “Based on the directions and keeping the welfare of students in view, we will take a call on resuming physical classes.” Deepak Gehlot, vice-president of DPG Degree College, said: “Colleges should be open as the government has started the physical classes at the school level. Most of the students are already vaccinated and even the number of cases is going down.” However, many colleges are awaiting guidelines from the department of higher education as the admission portal for second and third-year undergraduate programmes are yet to open. “We have to make arrangements for boarding students before starting physical classes. Moreover, the admission process is yet to get started for second and third-year undergraduate students,” Ramesh Kumar Garg, principal, Government College for Girls, Sector 14. Lockdown extended till Oct 4 The government has extended the lockdown for another fortnight till October 4 in an order. All relaxations mentioned in the previous orders will continue to apply across the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/colleges-and-polytechnics-in-haryana-allowed-to-reopen/articleshow/86352819.cms||Akanksha Gupta

After the accident, the dumper driver fled the spot, the cops added. At 1 am on Sunday, Tanvi Madan asked her friend Bhavana Rajpal to pick her up from Nirvana Country in Sector 50. Bhavana drove to the spot along with her flatmate Smriti Sachdeva. The women were returning to their apartment in Sushant Lok when a truck rammed their vehicle. The impact was such that the car turned upside down after being dragged for a few metres, an officer said. The women were rushed to a private hospital where Smriti was declared brought dead. The body has been handed over to the family after post-mortem. All the three women hailed from Sonipat. Two days ago, Tanvi had arrived in the city from Sonipat to help Bhavana shop for her wedding. Bhavana, who was driving the car, worked with Smriti in a private company in Gurgaon. A probe is on to nab the driver, an officer said.

---||Gurgaon||As Bandhwari leachate threat to Aravalis flagged, samples taken||GURUGRAM: The Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) has collected samples from the Bandhwari waste-to-energy plant after green activists alleged that a cesspool of leachate, which had accumulated behind the plant, was seeping into the groundwater. The plant, environmentalists claim, has been polluting groundwater for some time now and posed a threat to wildlife and people living in the nearby areas. As per an HSPCB report, samples of leachate collected from the Bandhwari landfill in the second week of August contained chemicals in excess of the permissible limits as well as toxic substances. “We collected samples from three ponds near the Bandhwari plant on September 18,” an HSPCB official said Sunday. The results, however, are awaited. Over 1,100 tonnes of solid waste from Gurugram and Faridabad is dumped at Bandhwari every day. Vaishali Rana Chandra, an activist, who was with the wildlife and pollution board staff when the groundwater samples were collected, said, “The HSPCB collected samples of leachate which was flowing out of the waste plane into the Aravalis.” According to Chandra, discharge of untreated leachate and other waste at the landfill site in the Aravalis poses a serious health hazard to people in neighbouring cities of Gurugram and Faridabad, as they are at a higher elevation along natural water drainage and groundwater recharge areas. “On August 12, on the basis of my complaint, the HSPCB officials had collected leachate samples from three places inside the landfill and also from a huge cesspool of leachate immediately outside the landfill in the Aravalis jungle. The leachate testing report, made available to me on August 28 by the HSPCB, clearly speaks of parameters being on a higher side in terms of serial no 5 and 6, BOD [biological oxygen demand] and COD [chemical oxygen demand], respectively. Even ammoniacal nitrogen [a toxic pollutant] is also on the higher side. The report shows its highly toxic and untreated leachate which is being discharged in the jungle,” Chandra said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/as-bandhwari-leachate-threat-to-aravalis-flagged-samples-taken/articleshow/86352842.cms||Ipsita Pati

---||Ghaziabad||As Ghaziabad focuses on ‘risk areas’, new dengue hotspots emerge||GHAZIABAD: The maximum number of dengue cases are being reported from Govindpuram, Shastri Nagar, Makanpur and Muradnagar areas of Ghaziabad this time. Many of these areas are different from the places that were affected by vector-borne diseases in the previous years. Based on the analysis of dengue cases in the past five years, the health department had earlier this month identified five urban areas, which were considered as high-risk zones for the disease. The urban areas listed were Akbarpur-Behrampur, Sudamapuri (Vijay Nagar), Indirapuram and Vaishali, Nandgram and Karhedra. This year, Mahendra Enclave in Shastri Nagar has reported over 18 dengue cases, followed by 16 in Harsaon (Govindpuram) 12 in Makanpur and nine cases in Muradnagar. The number of cases could be much more than this as this analysis is based on the first 100 cases reported in the district, while the actual number of cases is close to 150 now. Talking about the emergence of new areas, chief medical officer Dr Bhavtosh Shankhdhar said, “The one reason could be that we covered these areas thoroughly as soon as dengue cases started to emerge in the district. We have already initiated drives in the new areas to control vector-borne diseases.” On the first day of the drive which started on Saturday, the anti-larvae and fogging drive was conducted in Govindpuram and parts of Kavi Nagar where dengue larvae were found in 56 places. Most of the larvae were found in pots kept for birds on the roof, water coolers and flowerpots. The malaria department issued notices to all the houses where the larvae were found. Apart from this, larvae have been found at more than 20 places in Raj Nagar Extension, Kaushambi and Vaishali. About 150 dengue cases have been reported this season, which is the highest in the past four years. Officials said an analysis of cases has revealed that no patient has shown haemorrhage, otherwise the situation would have been worse. “Doctors need to keep a track of the platelet count as well as see that the patient is not bleeding. Quick platelet transfusion and other medication are required to save the life of the patient,” said Dr Shankhdhar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ghaziabad/as-gzb-focuses-on-risk-areas-new-dengue-hotspots-emerge/articleshow/86352922.cms||Aditya Dev
---||Noida||Power infra in UP was worst during SP rule, says minister||Noida/Ghaziabad: The power situation in the state “was the worst” during the erstwhile government of Samajwadi Party, cabinet minister Suresh Khanna said in Ghaziabad on Thursday. The minister joked that people then would deliberately name their daughters “Bijli” so they could tell others that electricity was at home in the evening. “During SP rule, people had named their daughters Bijli. When they would come home after playing, they would laugh that power had finally returned,” he told a news conference. Ministers, MPs and other senior politicians held news conferences across the state to mark four and a half years of the Yogi Adityanath government. They listed out achievements of the government and attacked the opposition. The timing of the events, however, gave rise to speculation that BJP had already sounded its poll bugle — assembly elections in the state are due next year. Asked about the power tariff that many residents consider high, Khanna saw nothing wrong in it. He said people were paying for good service. In Noida, too, MP Mahesh Sharma attacked the previous government on electricity. “We are a power-surplus state, but electric supply could have been improved years ago. The previous government was just not ready to do it. Now, Noida has nearly 24 hours of power supply,” he said. The MLAs from Noida, Jewar and Dadri also attended the news conference and highlighted the achievements of the state government. Noida residents have often questioned the city’s power infrastructure. Even after mild showers, outages are reported from several sectors. Among the achievements that were highlighted were the Noida International Airport and the Film City in Jewar, the data centre, logistics hub and the DMIC corridor passing through Dadri. The MP also released a presentation, describing what the district had done in areas such as healthcare and Covid control, PM Awas Yojana, agriculture, women and child development, and so on. Asked if this was the start of the poll campaign, Sharma said it was just a celebration of the government’s achievements. In Ghaziabad, Khanna alleged that the farmers protesting against the three laws were being “misguided” by the opposition. “The actual farmers are with the government and happy with the steps taken,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/power-infra-in-up-was-worst-during-sp-rule-says-minister/articleshow/86352909.cms||---

The minister, who called unfounded the rumours that the decision on school reopening was taken by the high-power committee headed by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan keeping the education department in dark, said, “All decisions were taken in consultation with the education department. Rumours claiming otherwise are baseless. It’s the chief minister who should announce the important decisions,” Sivankutty said. The minister said a plan for the school reopening would be submitted to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan before October 15 for his clearance.  “Classes would be organized by ensuring the safety of children. The plan would suggest how classes can be organized safely. The government is committed to take into confidence all the stakeholders. Discussions will be held with teachers’ organizations and the worries of parents would be allayed,” he said. Sivankutty said there was no point in the arguments that school reopening would intensify the spread of Covid-19. “Schools are not being opened to intensify the spread of virus. There were such concerns when the SSLC examination was held. But nothing wrong happened then,” the minister said. The plan being readied by the education department would be a sort of protocol to be followed by the students and teachers in schools. It would also give instructions on the travel of students by school bus. The Covid-19 review meeting on Saturday had decided to reopen schools in Kerala on November 1. As per the plan, classes for one to seventh and 10th to 12th standards would be reopened on November 1. Other school classes would begin by November 15.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/plan-soon-for-school-reopening-kerala-education-minister-v-sivankutty/articleshow/86356471.cms||---
---||Noida||Noida: As winter nears, Okhla gets ready for winged guests||NOIDA: Even as forest officials start habitat development ahead of winter, some migratory bird species have already been spotted at the Okhla Bird Sanctuary in Noida. Officials say that small birds and waders such as pallas' gull, black-bellied tern, whiskered tern and marsh harrier are already being seen. With the monsoon nearly ending, the forest department has started cleaning, clearing overgrown foliage and making other preparations for the upcoming winters at the sanctuary. One of the most important habitat development activities annually is the cleaning of the river area and removing the water hyacinth that is unsafe for many species. Because of good monsoon this year, the water hyacinth has spread across a larger portion of the river. For the past few years, officials have been using the cleared water hyacinth to create mounds, platforms and small islands for the resting and perching of several bird species. Officials said that most of the migratory birds prefer to stay put on these mounds and platforms in the middle of the water body since disturbance from the surroundings is limited. The entire habitat development process takes up to two months. With better monsoon and rejuvenation of freshwater ponds across the NCR region, it is expected that “The cleaning job is almost complete, and we are now getting the painting and repair work done. The wooden bridge leading to the central watchtower was in a dilapidated state for the past few years. We have fixed it and it is ready to be used,” said PK Srivastava, divisional forest officer. Nature trails, benches, floating platforms and pathways have been cleared for visitors. Arrangements for cycling as well as golf carts have also been made for the tourists. The Okhla Bird Sanctuary is spread across 400 hectares and covers part of the Yamuna banks on the border of Noida and Delhi. Around 20,000 birds visit the sanctuary every year from over 70 species. While the bird sanctuary is a haven for regular birders, it also attracts many tourists and cycling groups during the winter months. However, the introduction of cottages for night stays has not gone well with the birders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/as-winter-nears-okhla-gets-ready-for-winged-guests/articleshow/86352995.cms||Snehil Sinha

The accused was identified as Badal, a daily wage worker. Virendra Singh, inspector, Phase-3 police station said that both the groups are accusing each other over the encroachment issue. “This led to an argument following which Badal used a knife to stab his neighbour’s daughter on her hand and face multiple times,” the officer said. He added that other neighbours intervened and called the police helpline. A team reached the spot and the girl was rushed to a nearby hospital for treatment. Badal, however, had managed to flee from the spot. Based on the family’s complaint, a case was registered against the accused at Phase-3 police station under Section 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means) of the IPC and relevant sections of the Arms Act. Badal was apprehended late Saturday night from Sector 63 following a tip-off from an informant, Singh said.

---||World||North Korea says US submarine deal, alliance could trigger 'nuclear arms race'||SEOUL: North Korea's foreign ministry on Monday said a new US alliance in the Indo-Pacific and recent US submarine contract with Australia could trigger a "nuclear arms race" in the region. Last week the United States announced a new three-way security pact with Australia and Britain, as part of a strategic partnership under which US nuclear submarines will be supplied to Canberra. "These are extremely undesirable and dangerous acts which will upset the strategic balance in the Asia-Pacific region and trigger off a chain of nuclear arms race," North Korean state media KCNA quoted a foreign ministry official as saying. "This shows that the US is the chief culprit toppling the international nuclear non-proliferation system," said a foreign news section chief at the ministry's Department of Press and Information. On Wednesday, nuclear-armed North Korea fired off two missiles into the sea, with Seoul successfully test-firing a submarine-launched ballistic missile hours later, becoming only the seventh country in the world with the technology. The spate of missile tests and bumper defense deals in the Pacific have highlighted a regional arms race that is intensifying as a China-US rivalry grows. "It is quite natural that neighboring countries including China condemned these actions as irresponsible ones of destroying the peace and stability of the region," the North Korean official said. US President Joe Biden's new Australia-US-Britain defense alliance is widely seen as aimed at countering the rise of China. His administration's relationship with North Korea has marked a change in tone from his predecessor Donald Trump, who engaged in an extraordinary diplomatic bromance with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. "The US double-dealing attitude getting all the more pronounced after the emergence of the new administration erodes the universally accepted international norm and order and seriously threatens the world peace and stability," the North Korean ministry official said. The official added that North Korea "will certainly take a corresponding counteraction in case it has even a little adverse impact on the security of our country".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/north-korea-says-us-submarine-deal-alliance-could-trigger-nuclear-arms-race/articleshow/86356978.cms||---

---||Business||Import duty on cars 'outrageous': Mercedes-Benz||NEW DELHI: Calling the duty on imported cars "outrageous", Mercedes-Benz - the leader of luxury cars in India - has supported rival Tesla's demand that taxes should be brought down, "or else customers get penalised by buying the cars at double to what buyers in the US and other western markets pay." Martin Schwenk, the MD of Mercedes-Benz in India, has said that import duties in India are extremely high and should be reduced immediately to help develop the market for new cars that carry global technologies. "Please remember that currently it is not possible to localise all new technologies, including electrics, in India due to the low level of sales volumes that we have here. We can't get customers at these duty levels," Schwenk told TOI, seeking reduction in duty in line with what Tesla and its founder Musk have also appealed for. "I support the demand. My only submission is that duties should be reduced for all kinds of high-technology luxury products, and not just for electrics," he said. In a Twitter interaction in July, Musk had said that his company is ready to set up a factory in India, but first wants a "temporary relief" on import duty which he termed as "the highest in the world". "If Tesla is able to succeed with imported vehicles, then a factory in India is quite likely," he added, seeking an easier duty regime initially before getting real investments. Currently, India imposes 100% duty on fully imported cars with CIF (Cost, Insurance and Freight) value more than $40,000 and 60% on those costing less than the amount. "This is real hurdle for developing the market," Schwenk said, adding that duty in most international markets is around 10%. "Finally, it's the Indian customer that gets penalised. I sell the same car at half the price in the US. The tax burden in India is very high, and slows down the growth." While some sections within the government have been sympathetic to the demands of luxury players on import duty reduction, the ministry of heavy industries - which sets the policy for the country's automobile sector - does not favour the measure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/import-duty-on-cars-outrageous-merc/articleshow/86357001.cms||Pankaj Doval
---||Ludhiana||Punjab: How not to handle crisis? Congress sets an example||JALANDHAR: Handling of Punjab affairs by the Congress high command during the past five months, including the latest chapter of replacing the chief minister, could well be a B-school case study explaining how not to tackle an internal crisis in the party. The latest and the worst was the delay by the party central leadership in deciding the successor after it forced Captain Amarinder Singh to resign from the post of the Punjab chief minister. The top brass had already complicated the internal crisis — by not resolving the issues which started emerging over two years back. It just kept looking the other way. Then it worked out a peace formula that failed within a few weeks. Even after it decided that Amarinder had to go, apparently on Friday night, it failed to take a call on who was going to be his replacement. It just ended up causing more heart burning in different camps within the party. Punjab: Live updatesAll of this when the state assembly elections are a little over four months away and model code of conduct would come into force some time in January, giving little time to the new incumbent to do anything on ground. A similar situation was witnessed when Navjot Singh Sidhu was appointed the Punjab Congress president and an unprecedented formula of four working presidents from different communities and castes was put in place. Amarinder and Sidhu damaged each other. Read AlsoCharanjit Singh Channi takes oath as first Dalit CM of PunjabCongress MLA Charanjit Singh Channi took oath as the new chief minister of Punjab on Monday. The 58-year-old is the first Dalit chief minister of the state. OP Soni and Sukhjinder Randhawa also took oath as ministers.It was Amarinder’s removal which was considered to the toughest task, given his capacity to manoeuvre. Finding his replacement got more complicated, even as barring Amarinder himself, all other MLAs had deferred before the high command wishes and within no time passed a resolution authorising Congress president Sonia Gandhi to pick up their new leader. It also became evident that unity which existed among Amarinder’s detractors disappeared as soon as he was removed, They started check-mating one another. Factionalism thrived and different lobbies were daggers drawn by the evening. Firstly, Sunil Jakhar’s name was blocked by a lobby working against him. Then, Ambika Soni’s name was seriously considered on Saturday late night, which surprised many within as well as outside the party. On Sunday morning she ‘declined’. Then initially Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa’s name emerged, but he was also blocked by lobbies within the party. For sometime even Fatehgarh Sahib MP Amar Singh’s name was also doing the rounds. Navjot Sidhu too remained in the race. Finally, Charanjit Singh Channi was picked by the party. In all this, Jakhar, who had not even thrown his hat in the ring but was considered to be the best option by a section in the party in the given situation, and Randhawa faced embarassment. The situation has neither helped Sidhu as his name also appeared in the race for the post. The whole development showed the Congress’s central leadership in poor light. Infighting: Channi gained most in 6 yearsIt is the second time when Charanjit Singh Channi has been the biggest beneficiary of infighting between big Congress leaders. In 2015, when Captain Amarinder Singh wanted to become the Punjab Congress president replacing Partap Singh Bajwa and managed to build pressure on the party high command with support of several MLAs and other senior leaders, then CLP leader Sunil Jakhar offered to quit to facilitate factional balance as the party high command might not want all posts with Amarinder’s camp. Amarinder was appointed the PPCC president and Jakhar was replaced by Channi. This time, Navjot Sidhu played most crucial role in Amarinder’s removal and also bore the brunt of adverse publicity by the outgoing CM, but Channi got the most coveted post. At the same time, Jakhar became fall guy on both the occasion, first to facilitate Amarinder and this time he quit as the PPCC president for Sidhu, even as on no occasion was his performance under question.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/punjab-how-not-to-handle-crisis-congress-sets-an-example/articleshow/86357103.cms||IP Singh

Hard lockdowns in Victoria will end once 70% of its adult population gets fully vaccinated, expected around Oct. 26, and authorities aim to hit 80% before the Nov. 2 Melbourne Cup, Australia's most famous horse race. A total of 567 new locally acquired infections were detected in Victoria, the majority in state capital Melbourne, up from 507 on Sunday, and one new death was recorded. Daily cases have topped 500 for the past five days. Nearly half of Australia's 25 million people is in lockdown after the Delta variant spread rapidly in Sydney and Melbourne, forcing Victoria and New South Wales to abandon a Covid-zero target and shift to rapid vaccinations to ease curbs. Australia has largely lived in Covid-zero for much of the pandemic, recording 1,163 deaths and some 86,000 cases. About 55,000 cases have been registered since mid-June when the first Delta infection was detected in Sydney. As the vaccine rollout gathers speed, some restrictions on gatherings were relaxed on Monday in 12 of the worst-hit suburbs in Sydney's west. Time limits for outdoor exercise were lifted, while the fully vaccinated can gather outside in groups of five. About 82% of the adult population in New South Wales, home to Sydney, have had their first dose, against Victoria's 72%, and above the national average of 71%. About 47% of the national population have been fully vaccinated. A four-stage national reopening scheme revealed by the federal government in July urges states and territories to begin easing lockdowns once fully vaccinated levels reach 70%-80%. Some virus-free states such as Queensland and Western Australia, whose borders remain closed to Sydney and Melbourne residents, have said they may delay their reopening plans due to cases in Victoria and New South Wales.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/covid-19-cases-jump-in-australias-victoria-as-curbs-ease-in-sydney-hotspots/articleshow/86357110.cms||---

---||World||North Korea slams US over submarine deal, warns countermeasures||SEOUL: North Korea has criticized the US decision to provide nuclear-powered submarines to Australia and warned of unspecified countermeasures if it finds the deal affects the North's security. State media on Monday published comments from an unidentified North Korean Foreign Ministry official who called the arrangement between US, Britain and Australia an "extremely dangerous act'' that would destroy the security balance in the Asia-Pacific and trigger a "chain reaction of arms races.'' The official said the North was closely examining the deal and would proceed with corresponding actions if it has "even the smallest negative affect on our country's safety.'' US President Joe Biden revealed last week a new alliance including Australia and Britain that would deliver an Australian fleet of at least eight nuclear-powered submarines. Biden has stressed the vessels would be conventionally armed. The announcement triggered an angry reaction from France, which accused Australia of concealing its intentions to back out of a 90 billion Australian dollar ($66 billion) contract for French majority state-owned Naval Group to build 12 conventional diesel-electric submarines. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison blamed the switch on a deteriorating strategic environment in the Indo-Pacific, a clear reference to China's massive military buildup that has gained pace in recent years. The North Korean official made an apparent reference to the French complaints, saying that the United States was being accused of back-stabbing even by its allies. The official said the North supports the views of China and other countries that the deal would destroy "regional peace and security and the international non-proliferation system and intensify arms races.'' "The current situation shows once again that (our) efforts to bolster national defense capabilities based on long-term perspectives should not be eased by even a bit,'' the official told the Korean Central News Agency. The North has suspended its testing of nuclear bombs and intercontinental-range ballistic missiles that could hit the US mainland since 2018 when leader Kim Jong Un initiated diplomacy with former President Donald Trump while attempting to leverage his arsenal for badly needed sanctions relief. Nuclear negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang have stalled since the collapse of a second Trump-Kim meeting in 2019, when the Americans rejected North Korean demands for major sanctions relief in exchange for dismantling an aging nuclear facility, which would have amounted to only a partial surrender of its nuclear capabilities. While maintaining its self-imposed moratorium on nuclear and ICBM tests, the North has continued testing shorter range weapons threatening US allies South Korea and Japan in an apparent effort to pressure the Biden administration over the stalled diplomacy. The North this month tested a new cruise missile it intends to eventually arm with nuclear warheads and demonstrated a new system for launching ballistic missiles from trains.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/north-korea-slams-us-over-submarine-deal-warns-countermeasures/articleshow/86357028.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: 4 children drown during Ganesh visarjan in Bhind||BHOPAL: Four children including two siblings died while taking a bath in the pond on the occasion of Ganesh immersion in Bhind district on Sunday evening. The incident took place at the pond of Vankhandeshwar Mahadev temple in Mehgaon area. The deceased were identified as Prashant, Abhishek, Sachin and Harshit, aged 10 to 12 years. Prashant and Abhishek were children of Dhanauli village sarpanch Raju. They had gone to the pond of Vankhandeshwar Mahadev temple in Mehgaon for Ganesh immersion along with others.

---||Delhi||Eye on polls, 2 roads in east Delhi named after personalities from Uttarakhand||NEW DELHI: Two roads in the Patparganj assembly constituency, which is represented by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, have been named after two famous personalities of Uttarakhand—martyr Kesari Chand and folk singer Heera Singh Rana. Rana was the first vice-president of an academy in Delhi to promote Garhwali, Kumaoni and Jaunsari languages. He showed glimpses of the beauty and struggles of Kumaon through his poems and songs. Chand was a soldier in the Azad Hind Fauj during the freedom struggle. The C-Block Marg No. 4 in West Vinod Nagar ward is now called Late Hira Singh Rana Marg and the road from Vinod Nagar red light to Silver Line Hospital will now be known as Amar Shaheed Veer Kesari Chandra Marg. Sisodia said Rana’s poems will become an example for generations to come and his writings would prove to be useful to the country. “Rana wrote with great intensity about the challenges posed by mountains, discrimination spread across the mountains and the migration of residents due to lack of facilities,” Sisodia said. He added that Chand sacrificed his life in the freedom struggle at the young age of 24. “The name of the road after Chand will inspire all. This will be a true tribute to our immortal martyr fighters,” Sisodia said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/eye-on-polls-2-roads-in-east-delhi-named-after-personalities-from-uttarakhand/articleshow/86357424.cms||---
---||Bhopal||Amid restrictions, Bhopal bids goodbye to Bappa||BHOPAL: Learning from the 2019 Ganesha idol immersion tragedy, Bhopal administration took strict measures to ensure safe visarjan this year. Bhopal Municipal Corporation made arrangements of collecting idols from public places — Lal Ghati Square, Gandhi Nagar, Karond Square, Bhavani Chowk (Peer Gate temple), Nadra Bus Stand, Near 5 No. Stop Petrol Pump, Shahpura Square Lake, Ashima Mall, Awadhpuri Chauraha and such others. For this purpose, idols from 22 vehicles were used to take them to the ghats. Immersion took place at Rani Kamalapati Ghat Arch Bridge, Prempura Ghat, Sehore Naka, Hathaikheda Anantpura, Shahpura, Aintkhedi, Khatlapura, Naronha Sankal and Malikhedi sites. In addition to this, Covid norms were also in place in the state capital. Despite this, residents were seen flouting Covid guidelines with many seen without masks moving in large groups. As per the new norms, only 10 people were allowed to visit the Ghats to immerse the big idols. Only two people were allowed to take smaller idols to the ghat. The district collector in his order under section 144 of the CrPC had said that not more than 10 persons from among the organisers would be allowed to accompany the idol of Lord Ganesh for immersion and that, too, with written permission of the district administration but the order was not followed by several organising committees. This led to an assembly of huge crowds at several immersion sites on occasion during the day. Though BMC said that it had made arrangements in each ward for immersion of smaller idols in the tanks, BMC personnel were not seen in as many places. At the stretch from Trilanga to 10 no. market stop, they were not there anywhere, making all the peopleorganisers of Ganesh festival at public places and those who installed idols of the Lord in their housing societies, colonies or houses- go to Shahpura lake for immersion of the idols. However, in several households, the idols were immersed in the tank, bucket or tub in the home itself. Some people, however, complained that the idol sold to them as that of clay probably has some chemical in it because it doesn't dissolve in water as easily as clay should have. "It takes quite some time, at times even days for the idol to dissolve in water. Which should not be the case if it were made of clay alone. I feel they mix something, maybe some chemical, that's why it doesn't dissolve so easily. I had immersed the idol in a bucket at home last year but this year, I have done it in Shahpura lake for this reason only", said a woman, who had come with her husband for immersion of Ganesh idol. Immersion of idols is taking place at all the major ghats in the city and its outskirts including Rani Kamalapati Ghat, Arch Bridge, Prempura Ghat, Sehore Naka, Hathaikheda Anantpura, Shahpura, Eintkhedi, Khatalapura, Naronha Sankal and Malikhedi sites.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/amid-restrictions-bhopal-bids-goodbye-to-bappa/articleshow/86357432.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Workshop trains priests on safe Puja rituals in pandemic times||KOLKATA: The pandemic has not only changed the way we celebrate our festivals but also how the rituals are performed. Close to 175 priests in various stages of seniority have assembled in Kolkata for a nine-day workshop to learn about the Covid-19 safety guidelines during Durga Puja next month and how to perform various rituals incorporating the protocol. They will also be given a crash course to brush up their chanting skills and many of them have newly joined the profession. The workshop which started on Sunday evening is being held at the Sovabazar Rajbari in north Kolkata. “The pandemic has changed our festivals and how we perform the rituals. In a festival like Durga Puja, the most crowded part is the inside of the pandal, where the deity is positioned and the priest is performing the rituals. So, from the safety point of view, it is important that the priests responsible for performing the rituals have the correct understanding of the safety guidelines not only for his own safety but also the visitors and to ensure that all the rituals are performed abiding by the rule book,” said Jayanta Kushary of Sarba Bharatiya Prachya Vidya Academy, a school of oriental studies. The government has made mask mandatory in public places. “But puja cannot be performed wearing something that is sewn. So, we will be teaching them on how to tie a big hanky or a piece of cloth during that time. They will also have to ensure that the entire place is sanitised and they are fully vaccinated,” said Kushary. Last year the maximum number who could enter the pandal to offer Anjali at a given point of time was fixed. “The priests will have to ensure that the number does not exceed. Also, hurling flowers at the deity will not be allowed. Devotees will have to put the flowers at a designated point from where they will be picked up. People crowd in front of the priests clicking pictures of the idols. Priests will have to ensure that it doesn’t happen,” said Kushary. Number of Durga Pujas in the city and its suburbs has been rising, including community Durga Pujas and those celebrated in housing societies. This has increased the demand for priests to perform the rituals associated with the festival. Many new people have joined the profession to fill the demand and supply gap. “During the workshop we will train those, who are new, on how to chant the mantras properly and work on their diction. They will also be shown the right ways to perform the rituals,” said Kushary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/workshop-trains-priests-on-safe-puja-rituals-in-pandemic-times/articleshow/86351718.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh will develop only when tribals join mainstream: CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan||BHOPAL: Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said on Sunday that development of Madhya Pradesh is possible only when the tribals of the state join the mainstream of society. The state government has geared up to protect the education, health, livelihood development and constitutional rights of the tribes. The tribals have the first right on the government treasury and we are determined to open the treasure of both money and opportunity to them. Chouhan said that the budget has been raised over the years for the overall development of the tribals. In 2003-04, the budget of the tribal affairs department was Rs 746.60 crore, which was increased to Rs 8,085.99 crore in the year 2020-21. In this way the budget of this category was increased by 948%. The chief minister further said that Madhya Pradesh has the largest tribal population in the country. Here tribes comprise one fifth of the total population. For the all-round development of tribals, educational, economic, social and employment related schemes are being run by the state government for the people of different age groups. He further said that we will bring revolution in tribal education and will leave no stone unturned in providing the benefits of the new education policy to the tribal children and youth. Decision has been taken to initiate online smart classes from Class VIII and IX for students to improve the foundation of NEET and JEE. We will also make the curriculum as per the present day requirement. At least 4 people from each gram panchayat will be trained as rural engineers on various subjects like agricultural equipment skills, IT services, building-related skills, organic farming for economic advancement through skill development. Government will never allow minor forest produce to be sold non-profitably. Last year, the support price of 32 minor forest produce was fixed. The government also procured minor forest produce at support prices. He said that Sickle Cell Mission would be started from November 15 in all 89 tribal development blocks of the state. He further said that 1.5 lakh hectares forest area has increased in the state in the last 15 years. Also, less dense forests have been converted into dense forests. Our tribal brethren and other local people have played a big role in saving the forests. The PESA Act empowers the Gram Sabha to protect and conserve community resources. We are going to give the responsibility of setting up community forest management committees to the Gram Sabha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-will-develop-only-when-tribals-join-mainstream-cm-shivraj-singh-chouhan/articleshow/86357111.cms||---
---||World||Justin Trudeau future on the line as Canadians vote in pandemic election||OTTAWA: Canadian elections headed for a photo finish Monday with liberal prime minister Justin Trudeau, who is seeking a third term, threatened by a strong challenge from rookie conservative leader Erin O'Toole. Trudeau called the snap election hoping to parlay a smooth Covid-19 vaccine rollout -- among the best in the world -- into a new mandate to steer the nation's pandemic exit, without having to rely on opposition party support to pass his agenda. But the contest, after a bumpy five weeks of campaigning, appears set for a repeat of the close 2019 general election that resulted in the one-time golden boy of Canadian politics clinging to power, yet losing his majority in parliament. A sudden surge in Covid-19 cases led by the Delta variant late in the campaign, after the lifting of most public health measures this summer, has also thrown a wrench into the works. At 49, Trudeau has faced tougher bouts and come out unscathed. But after six years in power, his administration is showing signs of fatigue, and it's been an uphill battle for him to convince Canadians to stick with his Liberals after falling short of high expectations set in his 2015 landslide win. "The main ballot box question at the start of this campaign was whether the Liberals deserved to have a majority government," said Daniel Beland, a politics professor at McGill University in Montreal. "But now the question is whether they deserve to stay in power." Going into the final stretch, the two main political parties that ruled Canada since its 1867 confederation were neck and neck with about 31 percent of voting intentions each and four smaller factions nipping at their heels. Voting across Canada's six time zones was scheduled to start in the Atlantic island province of Newfoundland at 8:30 am (1100 GMT) and wrap up in westernmost British Columbia at 7 pm (0200 GMT). An estimated 27 million Canadians are eligible to cast a ballot to select 338 members of Parliament. To keep his job, Trudeau's Liberals must win a plurality of seats and take at least 170 for a majority. Due to the pandemic, a significant number of mail-in ballots (1.2 million) are expected, which could mean the results of the election may not be known Monday evening. Pollster and former political strategist Tim Powers advised not counting Trudeau out. "I still think Justin Trudeau will win a minority government," he told AFP. "But is that a win for him?" he added, suggesting Trudeau may be turfed as leader if the Liberals fare poorly at the ballot box. The 36-day campaign -- the shortest allowed under Canadian law -- saw the contenders spar over climate actions, indigenous reconciliation, affordable housing, the recent Afghanistan crisis, mandatory Covid-19 inoculations and vaccine passports. Rivals criticized Trudeau over the timing of the election during a pandemic. Meanwhile, the 48-year-old O'Toole was knocked for his backing of Alberta and two other Tory-led provinces' loosening of public health restrictions too soon, with Covid-19 outbreaks now forcing their overwhelmed hospitals to fly patients across Canada for care. At rallies, Trudeau was dogged by what he described as "anti-vaxxer mobs," including one that threw stones at him. He also received endorsements from former US president Barack Obama and his former secretary of state Hillary Clinton. O'Toole, meanwhile, fumbled over gun control and was warned by Beijing, according to Chinese state media, that his proposed hardline on China -- Canada's second-largest trading partner, with whom relations have soured over its detention of two Canadian nationals -- would "invite counterstrikes." Overall, commented Max Cameron, a professor at the University of British Columbia, "this hasn't been a polarizing election. There's actually a lot of clustering around the middle." "This isn't Republicans versus Democrats south of the border," he said, referring to the United States. "This has been very much a Canadian campaign in which there's a strong consensus around what are the issues and how they have to be tackled." O'Toole, a relative unknown who became Tory leader only last year, tracked his party to the political center, forcing the Liberals to compete for votes on the left with the New Democrats and Greens, as well as the separatist Bloc Quebecois. The Conservatives, however, also saw their support clawed in the final week by former foreign minister Maxime Bernier's far right People's Party. When the final count is in, said University of Winnipeg professor Felix Mathieu, "it's unlikely anyone will have obtained a majority."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/justin-trudeau-future-on-the-line-as-canadians-vote-in-pandemic-election/articleshow/86357158.cms||---
---||World||Biden asks for early Macron talks as allies try to smooth tensions||PARIS: The United States and Britain sought Sunday to smooth tensions with Paris over a new security pact with Australia, with US President Joe Biden requesting early talks with his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron. The announcement of the defence alliance, and Australia's related decision to tear up a deal to buy French submarines in favour of American nuclear-powered vessels, sparked outrage in Paris, with Macron recalling France's ambassadors to Canberra and Washington in an unprecedented move. But on Sunday British Prime Minister Boris Johnson tried to downplay France's concerns about the deal, saying the pact was "not meant to be exclusionary... it's not something that anybody needs to worry about and particularly not our French friends". Biden has requested a phone call with Macron, French government spokesman Gabriel Attal said, which would happen "in the coming days". "We want explanations," Attal said, adding that the US had to answer for "what looks a lot like a major breach of trust". The recall of the ambassadors to Australia and the US -- for the first time in the history of relations with the countries -- was "to show how unhappy we are and that there is a serious crisis between us", French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said Saturday. "There has been lying, duplicity, a major breach of trust and contempt," Le Drian told France 2 television. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Sunday rejected the accusation that Canberra had lied, saying he had raised concerns over the now-scuppered subs deal "some months ago". "I think they would have had every reason to know that we had deep and grave concerns," he told reporters in Sydney. "We made very clear that we would be making a decision based on our strategic national interest." The French contract to supply conventional submarines to Australia was worth Aus$50 billion ($36.5 billion, 31 billion euros) when signed in 2016. Morrison said he understood France's disappointment, but added: "I don't regret the decision to put Australia's national interest first. Never will." Defence Minister Peter Dutton also insisted Canberra had been "upfront, open and honest" with Paris about its concerns -- a claim quickly rejected by French Defence Minister Florence Parly. "His statement is inaccurate," she said during a visit to Niger. "We were never informed of Australia's intentions." En route to New York on Sunday, Johnson told reporters that Britain and France have a "very friendly relationship", which he described as being of "huge importance". "Our love of France is ineradicable," he said. But although France has not recalled its ambassador to Britain, Le Drian's explanation for why was stinging. "There is no need. We know their constant opportunism. So there is no need to bring our ambassador back to explain," he said in the France 2 interview. Of London's role in the pact, he said: "Britain in this whole thing is a bit like the third wheel." A source at France's defence ministry said Paris had cancelled a meeting set for this week between Parly and her British counterpart Ben Wallace. In London, a Ministry of Defence source said they could neither confirm nor deny the cancellation. Biden announced the new Australia-US-Britain defence alliance, widely seen as aimed at countering the rise of China, on Wednesday. It extends American nuclear submarine technology to Australia, as well as cyber-defence, applied artificial intelligence and undersea capabilities. North Korea on Monday warned the deal could trigger a "nuclear arms race" in the region. "These are extremely undesirable and dangerous acts which will upset the strategic balance in the Asia-Pacific region and trigger off a chain of nuclear arms race," state media KCNA quoted a foreign ministry official as saying. China has also reacted angrily, describing the deal as an "extremely irresponsible" threat, and warning the Western allies they risked "shooting themselves in the foot". Paris' fury at what it sees as a "stab in the back" threatens long-term diplomatic repercussions. Le Drian said NATO would have to take account of what has happened as it reconsiders strategy at a summit in Madrid next year. France would now prioritise developing an EU security strategy when it takes over the bloc's presidency at the start of 2022, he added. French European Affairs Minister Clement Beaune has hinted that the row could affect Australia's chances of making progress towards a trade pact with the EU, its third-biggest trading partner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-asks-for-early-macron-talks-as-allies-try-to-smooth-tensions/articleshow/86357625.cms||---

It was the 41st green corridor in the city created for transportation of organs. A 37-year-old Neha Choudhary, resident of Parsavnath was admitted to Choithram hospital after suffering from brain haemorrhage around a week back. She was declared brain dead on Saturday after two simultaneous tests and a decision to go ahead with retrieval of organs was taken. The first green corridor to transport one retrieved kidney was created at 1.29pm on Sunday to CHL hospital. The ambulance carrying the first kidney took only six minutes, while another ambulance transported her second kidney to Bombay hospital within eight minutes 17 second from Choithram hospital through a green corridor. While two retrieved kidneys were transported for patients in another hospital, the liver was preserved for transplantation to one patient in Choithram itself. A team of doctors from a private hospital in New Delhi along with those of Chhoithram performed the retrieval process. “The patient’s organs were donated in accordance with her wish. She was very much impressed and motivated by organ donations done in the district in the past. So, we did it”, said Pankaj Choudhary, husband of the woman. State organ and transplant organisation secretary and MGMMC dean Dr Sanjay Dixit said, “We have also tried to look into the possibility of retrieving the lungs and heart of the woman but because she was on ventilator for the last one week and suffered heart attack twice earlier, the possibility was ruled out.” “Covid-19 tests were also performed on patients before retrieval of the organs and people should know that organ donation could be carried out even during the pandemic”, said Dr Dixit. The team also retrieved the eyes and skin of the patient and preserved it for future use.

Apart from the buzz surrounding Banerjee contesting the bypoll following her controversial loss in Nandigram, what is making the contest interesting is the battle of minnows. While some claim to be fighting just for fun others claim to be fighting to bring in a change. Also, there are a couple of dummy candidates, according to party sources. “My father was a reputable social worker. I want to follow in his footsteps. I am contesting the poll to gain some fame which will help me in continuing my social work,” said Ruma Nandan, an independent candidate from Gopal Mitra Lane in Bhowanipore, who sells pickles and manages a self-help group. Subrata Bose and Malay Guha Roy in their 60s and 50s, respectively, claimed they were fighting just for fun. In their social media profiles, both were found sharing schemes and programmes of the Trinamool. “I had contested in Nandigram as well and garnered 77 votes. But, I had thoroughly enjoyed the fun and popularity I received even at a place no one knows me. I hadn’t even campaigned for a day,” said Bose, a financial consultant and a resident of Behala Chowrasta. His neighbour and businessman Guha Roy is also contesting for the second time alongside Mamata Banerjee. He had earlier contested in 2016. “During my college days I was active in politics but didn’t pursue it as a career. But I always wanted to contest polls. It is fun to be named as a candidate alongside the leaders like our CM,” he said. Kidderpore importer Ashraf Alam (40) and Shaheena Ahmed (34) from Watgunge, who refused to share their details and reasons behind contesting the bypoll, are also in the fray. But, at least one independent candidate and two other candidates representing smaller parties vow to pose a tough challenge. “I am here to fight against corruption and post-poll violence,” said Chandrachur Goswami (32), a gold medallist in environmental studies and classical music. Swarnalata Sarkar, a yoga trainer representing a three-year-old Bharatiya Nyay Adhikar Raksha Party, and stationary shop owner Mangal Sarkar from Maharashtra-based Bahujan Maha Party are also in the race to “bring a change”. Satadru Roy, the principal of a private school in Kolkata, is also contesting the by-election representing Hindustani Awam Morcha Secular. Roy claimed that he was attacked on Sunday during campaigning. “Fielding independents is a long-time poll strategy. The contest here is mostly between us and TMC and Mamata Banerjee will lose again like she had lost in Nandigram,” said BJP candidate Priyanka Tibrewal. TMC’s Kartik Banerjee said they were not bothered about independents and the BJP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/yoga-trainer-principal-pickle-seller-musician-in-bhowanipore-bypoll-fray/articleshow/86352186.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Nevada) Dina Titus proposed an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2022 National Defence Authorization Act to ban the Turkish ultranationalist group known as the Grey Wolves. She also asked US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to report to the Congress within 180 days on the activities of the Grey Wolves - described by some as a paramilitary death squad- "including a review of the criteria met for designation as a foreign terrorist organization." The far-right Group has already been banned by France, after its members desecrated a memorial for the victims of the Armenian Genocide near Lyon and scuffled with Armenian protesters. Last October, French Interior Minister Gerard Darmanin announced that the Grey Wolves Group had been banned in France, saying it "incites discrimination and hatred and is implicated in violent actions." The Turkish Foreign Ministry immediately responded, calling the move "disgraceful," without actually acknowledging that the Grey Wolves existed. In March 2019, Austria also banned the "Wolf Salute" in the same list of signs belonging to organisations as the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and Hamas. The movement's salutation involves the fingers of the right hand with an outstretched arm to form a wolf's head. In November, the German Bundestag adopted a motion that urged the government to outlaw the group's affiliates, prevent its online agitation and monitor its activities. The Grey Wolves Group (GWG), founded in the 1960s by Colonel Alparslan Turkes, is an Islamist and neo-fascist organisation affiliated with the far-right Nationalist Movement Party (MHP), an ally of Erdogan's ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP). The Grey Wolves (known in Turkey as Bozkurtlar & Ulku Ocaklari) are a Pan-Turkic organisation, the ideal of which is to unite the Turkic peoples in one state stretching from the Balkans to Central Asia. The GWG was named after a Turkish legend according to which a wolf in pre-Islamic times led and saved the endangered Turkish tribes from the Altay Mountains in Central Asia. The GWG has long been a prominent suspect in investigations into the Turkish "deep state", and is suspected of having had close dealings in the past with the Counter-Guerrilla, the Turkish branch of the NATO Operation Gladio, as well as the Turkish mafia. The organisation became a death squad engaged in gun battles, street killings and violence directed against either the political left or ethnic minorities: Kurds, Greeks, and Armenians. Many Grey Wolves volunteered to fight Armenians during the first Nagorno-Karabakh War (1988-94) and were responsible for some of the worst atrocities perpetrated against Armenian civilians and prisoners. Grey Wolves in December 1978 were responsible for the Maras massacre when over 100 Alevis were killed and the Taksim Square massacre on the 1ST of May 1977. During this violent period, Grey Wolves operated with the encouragement and the protection of the Turkish Army's Special Warfare Department. One of Grey Wolves most notorious members is Mehmet Ali Agca , a Turkish assassin who killed in 1979 Abdi Ipekci, one of Turkey's most respected journalists. On 13 May 1981 Agca, after escaping from a Turkish prison, shot and wounded Pope John Paul II. In the wake of the 1980 coup in Turkey, the Grey Wolves focused their attacks against Kurds in Turkey and vociferously supported Ankara's occupation of part of Cyprus and Rauf Denktash, self-proclaimed President of the occupied part of Cyprus. In 1996 they murdered Kutlu Adali, a Turkish Cypriot journalist who had criticized Denktash's policies, and beaten to death Tassos Isaak, a Greek Cypriot protester in the United Nations Buffer Zone. In recent decades, the MHP has aligned with and allied itself to Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey's autocratic ruler. While MHP poses as a conservative party, in actual fact is a far-right party, which pushes Erdogan to an extremely nationalistic and expansionist path. Recep Tayyip Erdogan, benefits from the activities of the Grey Wolves, in terrorising Kurds, Armenians and members of opposition parties in Turkey, and in rallying together Turks living in Germany to vote for his AKP party. Erdogan has embraced the main causes of the Grey Wolves and has given them hundreds of jobs amid the mass purges he made following the failed coup attempt in 2016. Since his collaboration with the nationalist MHP, Erdogan has been using the Grey Wolves as his long arm in European states and countries where there is a sizeable Turkic population to support his policies. In the European Parliament a progress report on Turkey, prepared by Spanish Socialist Nacho Sanchez Amor suggested putting Turkey's Grey Wolves, on the EU terrorist list. The Parliament called on the European Council, the decision-making body of the Union, and the member states to "examine the possibility of adding Grey Wolves to the EU terrorist list." The report which passed with 480 votes in favour and 64 against at the plenary on May 19 underlines that the Grey Wolves Group is "especially threatening for people with a Kurdish, Armenian or Greek background and anyone they consider an opponent." Of course, it is not at all certain, that the EU Council, will proceed to ban the Gray Wolves Group, as it may not want to anger Erdogan, who blackmails Europe with opening the floodgates of refugees, temporarily residing in Turkey. However, it should act now to stop a very dangerous group which could destabilize several European countries. Professor Fawzi Al Ghazali, of the Trends Research Centre, points out: "The provocations and actions of the GWG in Europe and elsewhere do not reflect any of the true virtues of peace, tolerance and coexistence of Islam. Rather, they intensify Islamophobia, which has become a major issue for the European public and its policy makers. The risk is that the GWG will further incite Muslims and allied extremist groups within France and other European countries with the aim of destabilizing these states."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/will-the-grey-wolves-erdogans-long-arm-in-the-world-end-up-on-eu-and-us-terrorist-list/articleshow/86357785.cms||---
---||World||US launches mass expulsion of Haitian migrants from Texas||DEL RIO, Texas: The US flew Haitians camped in a Texas border town back to their homeland Sunday and tried blocking others from crossing the border from Mexico in a massive show of force that signaled the beginning of what could be one of America's swiftest, large-scale expulsions of migrants or refugees in decades.  More than 320 migrants arrived in Port-au-Prince on three flights, and Haiti said six flights were expected Tuesday. In all, US authorities moved to expel many of the more 12,000 migrants camped around a bridge in Del Rio, Texas, after crossing from Ciudad Acuna, Mexico.  The US plans to begin seven expulsion flights daily on Wednesday, four to Port-au-Prince and three to Cap-Haitien, according to a US official who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. Flights will continue to depart from San Antonio but authorities may add El Paso, the official said.  The only obvious parallel for such an expulsion without an opportunity to seek asylum was in 1992 when the Coast Guard intercepted Haitian refugees at sea, said Yael Schacher, senior US advocate at Refugees International whose doctoral studies focused on the history of US asylum law.  Similarly large numbers of Mexicans have been sent home during peak years of immigration but over land and not so suddenly.  Central Americans have also crossed the border in comparable numbers without being subject to mass expulsion, although Mexico has agreed to accept them from the US under pandemic-related authority in effect since March 2020. Mexico does not accept expelled Haitians or people of other nationalities outside of Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.  When the border was closed Sunday, the migrants initially found other ways to cross nearby until they were confronted by federal and state law enforcement. An Associated Press reporter saw Haitian immigrants still crossing the river into the US about 1.5 miles (2.4 kilometers) east of the previous spot, but they were eventually stopped by Border Patrol agents on horseback and Texas law enforcement officials.  As they crossed, some Haitians carried boxes on their heads filled with food. Some removed their pants before getting into the river and carried them. Others were unconcerned about getting wet.  Agents yelled at the migrants who were crossing in the waist-deep river to get out of the water. The several hundred who had successfully crossed and were sitting along the river bank on the U.S. side were ordered to the Del Rio camp. ``Go now,'' agents yelled. Mexican authorities in an airboat told others trying to cross to go back into Mexico.  Migrant Charlie Jean had crossed back into Ciudad Acuna from the camps to get food for his wife and three daughters, ages 2, 5 and 12. He was waiting on the Mexican side for a restaurant to bring him an order of rice. "We need food for every day. I can go without, but my kids can't,'' said Jean, who had been living in Chile for five years before beginning the trek north to the US It was unknown if he made it back across and to the camp.  Mexico said Sunday it would also begin deporting Haitians to their homeland. A government official said the flights would be from towns near the US border and the border with Guatemala, where the largest group remains.  Haitians have been migrating to the US in large numbers from South America for several years, many having left their Caribbean nation after a devastating 2010 earthquake. After jobs dried up from the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, many made the dangerous trek by foot, bus and car to the US border, including through the infamous Darien Gap, a Panamanian jungle.  Some of the migrants at the Del Rio camp said the recent devastating earthquake in Haiti and the assassination of President Jovenel Moise make them afraid to return to a country that seems more unstable than when they left. "In Haiti, there is no security," said Fabricio Jean, a 38-year-old Haitian who arrived in Texas with his wife and two daughters. "The country is in a political crisis."  Since Friday, 3,300 migrants have already been removed from the Del Rio camp to planes or detention centers, Border Patrol Chief Raul L. Ortiz said Sunday. He expected to have 3,000 of the approximately 12,600 remaining migrants moved within a day, and aimed for the rest to be gone within the week.  ``We are working around the clock to expeditiously move migrants out of the heat, elements and from underneath this bridge to our processing facilities in order to quickly process and remove individuals from the United States consistent with our laws and our policies,'' Ortiz said at news conference at the Del Rio bridge. The Texas city of about 35,000 people sits roughly 145 miles (230 kilometers) west of San Antonio.  Six flights were scheduled in Haiti on Tuesday -three in Port-au-Prince and three in the northern city of Cap-Haitien, said Jean Negot Bonheur Delva, Haiti's migration director.  The rapid expulsions were made possible by a pandemic-related authority adopted by former President Donald Trump in March 2020 that allows for migrants to be immediately removed from the country without an opportunity to seek asylum. President Joe Biden exempted unaccompanied children from the order but let the rest stand.  Any Haitians not expelled are subject to immigration laws, which include rights to seek asylum and other forms of humanitarian protection. Families are quickly released in the U.S. because the government cannot generally hold children.  Some people arriving on the first flight covered their heads as they walked into a large bus parked next to the plane. Dozens lined up to receive a plate of rice, beans, chicken and plantains as they wondered where they would sleep and how they would make money to support their families.  All were given $100 and tested for Covid-19, though authorities were not planning to put them into quarantine, said Marie-Lourde Jean-Charles with the Office of National Migration.  Gary Monplaisir, 26, said his parents and sister live in Port-au-Prince, but he wasn't sure if he would stay with them because to reach their house he, his wife and their 5-year-old daughter would cross a gang-controlled area called Martissant where killings are routine. "I'm scared," he said. "I don't have a plan." He moved to Chile in 2017, just as he was about to earn an accounting degree, to work as a tow truck driver. He later paid for his wife and daughter to join him. They tried to reach the US because he thought he could get a better-paying job and help his family in Haiti. ``We're always looking for better opportunities,'' he said. Some migrants said they were planning to leave Haiti again as soon as possible. Valeria Ternission, 29, said she and her husband want to travel with their 4-year-old son back to Chile, where she worked as a bakery's cashier. "I am truly worried, especially for the child," she said. "I can't do anything here.''||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-launches-mass-expulsion-of-haitian-migrants-from-texas/articleshow/86357649.cms||---

Holidays in Japan, China and South Korea made for thin conditions, and politics added extra uncertainty with elections in Canada and Germany bookending the week. The fate of Chinese property giant Evergrande, and its $300 billion in liabilities, is also in the balance with a bond interest payment due on Thursday. Concerns about the health of China's economy and Beijing's crackdown on tech firms continues to haunt the region, with stocks in Hong Kong skidding more than 3% to their lowest in almost 11 months. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slid another 1.4%, after shedding 2.5% last week, with Australia down 1.5%. Japan's Nikkei was shut, but futures were 400 points below the Friday cash close. The market could do with consolidating after surging to 30-year highs on hopes a new Prime Minister will bring more stimulus and policy change. Nasdaq futures eased 0.5% and S&P 500 futures fell 0.3%, with Wall Street ending last week on a soft note after disappointing U.S. consumer confidence data. The Fed is still expected to lay the groundwork for a tapering at its policy meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, though the consensus is for an actual announcement to be delayed until the November or December meetings. Yields on 10-year Treasuries touched a two-month top and the curve flattened ahead of the meeting. "A flatter yield curve suggests some fears the Fed may overdo the eventual hiking cycle," cautioned Tapas Strickland, a director of economics at NAB. He noted only 2-3 FOMC members would need to shift their "dot plot" forecasts for a hike in 2022 to make it the median, given seven of 18 had already tipped a move next year. "The Fed will also have dots for 2024 which will give an indication of the steepness of the potential hiking cycle." The market consensus is for two hikes in 2023 and four in 2024 with the longer-run fed funds rate seen at 2.125%. Central banks in the EU, Japan, UK, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, Indonesia, the Philippines, Taiwan , Brazil, South Africa, Turkey and Hungary all have meetings this week. The Norges Bank is expected to be the first in the G10 to raise interest rates. Higher U.S. yields has combined with general risk aversion to benefit the dollar which was up near a one-month high at 93.303 on a basket of currencies. It was range bound on the yen at 109.96, while the euro was near its lowest in three weeks at $1.1717 in part on uncertainty ahead of Germany's election this weekend. Canada goes to the polls on Monday with the race too close to call. The firmer dollar weighed on gold, which was pinned at $1,749 an ounce after losing 1.9% last week. Oil prices eased as energy companies in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico restarted production after back-to-back hurricanes in the region shut output. Brent fell 54 cents to $74.80 a barrel, while U.S. crude lost 57 cents to $71.40.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/asia-stocks-on-the-skids-hong-kong-hits-11-month-low/articleshow/86357818.cms||---
---||World||Britain's 'love of France is ineradicable': Boris Johnson||LONDON: British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Sunday played down the diplomatic rift with Paris over a new security pact with Australia and the US, saying his country's "love of France is ineradicable". Speaking to journalists as he flew to New York, Johnson insisted Britain and France have a "very friendly relationship", which he described as being of "huge importance". The security agreement, and Australia's related decision to tear up a multibillion-dollar deal for French submarines in favour of American nuclear-powered vessels, has sparked outrage in Paris, with President Emmanuel Macron recalling France's ambassadors to Canberra and Washington in an unprecedented move. French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said over the weekend that Britain was a "third wheel" in the affair, and accused London of "constant opportunism". France has cancelled a meeting set for this week between its Defence Minister Florence Parly and her British counterpart Ben Wallace, a source at her ministry told AFP Sunday. But on the plane Johnson downplayed France's concerns. He said the pact, dubbed AUKUS, was "not in any way meant to be zero-sum, it's not meant to be exclusionary". "It's not something that anybody needs to worry about and particularly not our French friends," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/britains-love-of-france-is-ineradicable-boris-johnson/articleshow/86357714.cms||---

Of the 21 new cases, 13 are males and eight females, including six children. One death due to the disease has been reported so far this year. The district had reported 20 cases on Saturday. The new cases were reported from New Manglik Parishar, Nemi Nagar, Dwarikapuri, Vidur Nagar, Silicon City, Jawahar Tekri, Shiv City, Alankar Palace, Shahi Bagh Colony, Sundar Nagar, LIG Colony, Narwal Sanwer Road, Shanti Nagar, Dasrath Bagh Colony, Ramjang Jinsi, Annapurna Nagar, and Vaishali Nagar. District malaria officer Daulat Patel said, “Indore district has been reporting around 20 new dengue cases in a day for the last one week or so with the start of a campaign to aware people about preventive measures.” “Our 14 field teams have been consistently visiting areas with new cases to identify larvae and do fogging to control the spread”, said Patel. The teams have been surveying over 400 households in a day with numbers even going as high as 700 on some occasion, Patel added.

The number of colleges offering this course also increased from 50 last year to 106 this year, taking the subject to tier-II institutions in rural areas. Colleges say the course is the second most preferred this year after computer science engineering. Professors from Anna University say faculty members and students in colleges need to be trained by industry experts, adding that the market could otherwise be flooded with untrained graduates as colleges start the course as an additional branch to computer science with a 70% similar syllabus. TOI spoke to experts to shed more light about the relatively new course and the job opportunities for those choosing it. “Data science is an interdisciplinary subject combining statistics and computing with a strong foundation in mathematics,” said Madhavan Mukund, director of Chennai Mathematical Institute. On the one hand, business schools focusing on case studies and data visualization treat mathematical analysis largely as a black box, he said. “On the other, more technically focused programmes that have grown out of statistics or engineering departments tend to offer limited offerings without always doing justice to all aspects of the subject.” The most effective data science programmes are those combining faculty expertise across statistics, computing and mathematics, along with the industry context through continuous engagement with industry,” Mukund said. Industry experts say the need for data scientists and data analysts will continue even post pandemic due to the digital transformation that is happening. “In the next few years, one tenth of the workforce in the IT services industry will become data scientists,” said Venkatesh D K, senior vice-president and global delivery head (healthcare and life sciences) Virtusa Consulting Services. Engineering colleges say the demand for computer science engineering has also increased. “Of every 10 management quota applications received, nine gave computer science as the first choice,” said R M Kishore, vice-chairman of RMK Engineering College. The next in preference were AI and data science, information technology and electronics and communication engineering. “Last year, 65% of computer science seats, 63% of AI seats and 71% of IT seats were filled. In civil engineering, only 23% seats were filled,” said career consultant Jayaprakash Gandhi, adding that the trend is the same this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-engineering-colleges-seek-to-cash-in-on-demand-up-intake-in-ai-data-sciences-by-100/articleshow/86357869.cms||A Ragu Raman

After soyabean crops were damaged because of inclement weather, many farmers went ahead with re-sowing of udad and moong crops. Now, the harvest lying in the field has been damaged by the late showers that are being experienced for the past three days. Earlier, there was largescale damage of paddy and soyabean in the region as the crops were damaged because of scanty rainfall. Now, heavy spells of rainfall have been witnessed in Damoh. Till a week back, the district had received 48% below normal rainfall. After the heavy spells, the figure has improved to 41% below normal. Similarly, from 39% below normal rainfall, Panna is now 31% rain deficient. Farmers said, “It did not rain when we wanted it to happen for the benefit of our standing crops. At many places, we started uprooting the crops and ran over them with tractors to clear the fields for the next cycle of crops after the monsoon”. Rajaram Kushwah, a farmer in Damoh’s Patharia village said, “After uprooting the crops, I did not remove them from the fields as I thought the government may conduct a survey for compensation and for proof of the damaged crops, I let them remain in the fields.” He said he cleared the fields for the cultivation of lentils. “Many of us had spent more money and decided to cultivate lentils”, he added. “But now, it started to rain heavily when the yield was lying in the fields for transportation. After the rains, the harvest is soaked in water leading to decay”, farmer Kushwah added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-bundelkhand-farmers-count-losses-as-rains-decay-standing-crops/articleshow/86357686.cms||---

This is as part of an initiative to have a museum in every district. Chengalpet was carved out of Kancheepuram in 2019 and the archaeology department will set up the museum. Among the exhibits would be artefacts from Alamparai Fort off the East Coast Road, about 100km south of Chennai. British-era porcelain ware now kept at the archaeology department’s headquarters in Chennai would also be put on display. Archaeology department sources said excavations could not be carried out in Chengalpet on a large scale, unlike in the rest of Tamil Nadu, as the district on Chennai’s periphery has been massively urbanised. So, a site museum is not possible. However, artefacts accidentally discovered while digging the earth for construction or to sink wells could be made part of the museum, officials added. Meanwhile, archaeological experts stressed that the museum must display antiquities highlighting the evolution of the region. Former archaeology officer C Santhalingam, who has done research on the Thondaimandalam region including Chengalpet, said artefacts dating back to the iron age, besides the Pallavas, Cholas and British can be traced to the region. “Excavated artefacts can be sourced from the Government Museum at Egmore and displayed in Chengalpet. Moreover, idols and photographs of Uthiramerur inscriptions (belonging to the tenth century) regarding local elections can also be exhibited,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-archaeology-department-to-set-up-museum-in-chengalpet/articleshow/86357981.cms||Yogesh Kabirdoss

Speaking to reporters, Kalyani said those leaving BJP must have serious grievances which have not been taken care of. “I have distanced myself from all programmes of the party. I have also given a deadline by which issues raised by me should be addressed or else I will have to think,” he said. Kalyani, however, did not elaborate on his grievances. Asked whether he will join some other party, Kalyani said he was contemplating options and would make his decision public at the right time. MP Babul Supriyo and four MLAs, including Mukul Roy, have left BJP to join TMC after assembly election results were declared on May 2. “It has to be seen on what circumstances they are leaving,” Kalyani said.The TMC district leadership in Uttar Dinajpur said they would welcome Kalyani into the party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/another-west-bengal-bjp-mla-voices-anger-hints-at-exiting-party/articleshow/86357978.cms||---
---||World||Real whole govt effort to partner with India under Biden admin: US-India Business Council chief||WASHINGTON: Under the Joe Biden administration, there is a "real whole government effort" to partner with India and to look at how the two democratic countries can usher in a greater opportunity in the future, said Nisha Desai Biswal, the president of US-India Business Council. Biswal, who was an assistant secretary of state for Central Asia in the Obama administration, told PTI in an interview that US President Biden and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi are pragmatic leaders and they see in each other the ability to advance key goals and priorities. As the Assistant Secretary of State for Central Asia, Biswal had played a key role in the US visit of Prime Minister Modi in 2014. "I think, the (Biden) administration is very eager,... there's a real whole government effort on the US side on partnering with India," she said, adding that Modi and Biden enjoy a very warm relationship. They have met each other in the past. But later this week, it would be the first time that they would have their face-to-face meeting at the White House. PM Modi will travel to the US this week to participate in the first in-person Quad summit that is expected to broadly focus on contemporary global challenges, including the Afghan crisis, the Covid pandemic and ensuring a free and open Indo-Pacific. In Washington, Modi is expected to hold separate bilateral talks with President Biden and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison. The Modi-Biden bilateral meeting is expected to take place at the White House on September 23. "I think they (Biden and Modi) have a warm relationship... But they're also both extremely pragmatic leaders who have very ambitious agendas and I think that they see in each other the ability to advance key goals and priorities as well," Biswal said. The head of the US India Business Council and the senior vice president for South Asia at the powerful United States Chamber of Commerce, Biswal said in recent weeks there has been a slew of visits from the US to India. Prominent among these include the visit of Special Envoy on Climate Change John Kerry and the Deputy Energy Secretary and the reported visit of the CIA director. Several top-level UD military officials have also made trips to India in recent weeks. The PM's visit, she observed, is coming at a really important time when the US and India, and certainly all the QUAD nations have so much to discuss. "Certainly we see that while there has been strong collaboration on the pandemic and particularly in responding to the surge that India experienced earlier this year, there is a lot of concern about how the pandemic is manifesting in the global community, with a Delta variant and a possibility of other new variants," Biswal said. "I think that both in the bilateral meetings, in the Quad meetings and in the convenings that are planned on the margins of UNGA, the ongoing pandemic is going to be a very key aspect. So I suspect that that's going to be a major area of focus." Climate collaboration between the US and India is going to be another area of deep focus for both countries, she said, adding that India has expressed a real interest in different aspects like green hydrogen on e-mobility and on making supply chains greener. "These are the things we at the US-India Business Council at the US Chamber are very supportive of as we think about the different new technology opportunities and the ability to help attract additional financing and investment into India's clean infrastructure initiatives," Biswal said. The things that are most looked forward to and are hopeful on the bilateral side is really on how Modi and Biden may engage on economic and trade partnership, she claimed. "Our collaboration across a whole spectrum of endeavours has become a high priority, whether it's on education and scientific research, or on looking at emerging areas of security, including cyber, that the US and India are increasingly converging in their perspective," Biswal said. Observing that it is important to find ways to converge trade and economic policies of the US and India, Biswal said PM Modi has taken some "very big steps recently", including that on retrospective taxation, and those have been "incredibly well-received" by the business and investor community. "But the United States and India do not have any kind of a structure, trade agreement, treaty or real architecture in place. We need to think about how we deepen and converge our economies and deepen our economic partnership," she said. Biswal said, "I'm hearing much more of a bullish stance from the Indian government on its desire to explore a deeper trade partnership with the United States. There's an openness to exploring an FTA, or some kind of a focused trade agreement. That is fantastic." She hoped that the two leaders would seize the opportunity to put both nations on track toward a more robust partnership. "When you look at new economic opportunities in emerging technology, digital economy, clean technology, supporting a manufacturing and supply chain ecosystem in India, I think now is the time to invest effort into moving this. The business community is very bullish on India and on the prospect of achieving some really big things with India," Biswal said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/real-whole-govt-effort-to-partner-with-india-under-biden-admin-us-india-business-council-chief/articleshow/86357920.cms||---

The authority has also removed the board announcing the vendor zone at the previous spot. The move comes after MLA Pankaj Singh asked the authority officials to discuss the matter with the RWA and FONRWA also supported the residents’ cause. Colonel (retd) IP Singh, chairman of Arun Vihar Residents’ Welfare Association (AVRWA), said, “After efforts of AVRWA and few residents of ward number 11, the issue of starting a ‘vendor zone’ opposite ward number 11 gate has been resolved amicably. For this, we made several requests for intervention to MLA Pankaj Singh after apprising him of the problem. Based on his instructions, officers from Noida Authority visited AVRWA office on Saturday, to reconsider the issue. On Sunday, we again visited the site where we highlighted the problems likely to be faced by the residents to the authority officials who were very understanding. After prolonged discussions, they ordered immediate shifting of the 'vendor zone', from the proposed location.” On Saturday, TOI had reported that residents of Arun Vihar opposed the Authority plan to set up a vendor zone for 100 stalls opposite the sector 37 gate and adjacent to ward 11A of the sector from the church side to Ambedkar market claiming that such a setup would not only cause inconvenience in movement as well as be a cause of safety concern.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/after-protest-vendor-zone-shifted-from-arun-vihar/articleshow/86358099.cms||Meenakshi Sinha

Greater Noida police said three FIRs have been filed against five persons, including Shyam Singh Bhati, the GB Nagar president of Akhil Bhartiya Veer Gurjar Mahasabha, at Dadri police station after a video of some people ripping off the posters began circulating on social media. Police have also deployed a heavy force in the village to prevent further escalation of tension. Local Gurjar leaders have claimed the king belonged to their community but the word ‘Gurjar’ had been deliberately omitted from the posters put by local BJP leaders across Dadri ahead of the September 22 event to appease other communities. According to Bhati, Bhoj belonged to the Gurjar community. “The UP CM is going to unveil Bhoj’s statue at a Dadri college on Wednesday. But local MLA Tejpal Nagar and other BJP leaders had dropped the word ‘Gurjar’ from the name of Bhoj to appease a section of people who claim Bhoj was a Rajput.” Nagar, meanwhile, said the CM would foundation stone for four to five projects worth Rs 12 crore and inaugurate of the statue of Bhoj. “There are some anti-social elements who are trying to create a dispute in the matter. Our party’s main focus is to give a good environment to the residents. Police are investigating the matter and strict action should be taken against these people,” he said. Besides Bhati, SHO Pradeep Tripathi of Dadri told TOI that police have lodged FIRs against four others —Vipin Nagar, Kartar Singh, Amit and Mohit Nagar — under sections 153 (wantonly giving provocation, with intent to cause riot), 505 (1)(B) (public mischief) and 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of Rs50) of IPC. “We have got some video clips in which people are seen damaging the posters and banners. We are trying to identify other people involved in the case. So far, no arrests have been made,” the SHO said. During his visit, Adityanath is scheduled to lay the foundation stones of a government girls’ inter-college, a science lab at Dadri College and a community centre, BJP sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/five-booked-after-row-over-mihir-bhojs-posters-in-dadri/articleshow/86358113.cms||Avishek Kumar Dubey

With All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) nod, Erode Sengunthar Engineering College in Perunthurai will offer mechanical engineering in Tamil while Rathinam Technical Campus in Coimbatore will offer CS in Tamil from this year. “Our college is situated in a rural area and Tamil-medium students are showing interest in studying BE in Tamil, so we started the course,” said V Venkatachalam, principal of Erode Sengunthar Engineering College. Except for CEG, the 16 constituent colleges of Anna University had poor enrolment to Tamilmedium courses due to lack of study materials in Tamil and fewer job opportunities. “Our college faculty members are translating resource material into Tamil. AICTE is translating engineering books in regional languages and Anna University has also already translated 15 subjects in mechanical engineering and released them on the website. We expect the translated material to be available from next academic year,” Venkatachalam said.

Work to set up two treatment plants — at Nesapakkam and Perungudi — is nearing completion. A senior Metrowater official said 76% of work on the Nesappakkam treatment plant is over and in the Perungudi plant, 66% of the work has been completed. While Nesappakkam plant will become operational by January, the one in Perungudi will be ready by March 2022, the official said. Tertiary treated ultra-filtration technology will be used. Each of the plants have the capacity to treat 10 million litres water a day. Metrowater is treating 90MLD of grey water in two existing plants at Kodungaiyur and Koyambedu (each 45MLD capacity). Both the plants adopt reverse osmosis technology and the treated water from these two plants are potable, said the official. At present, 540MLD of grey water is generated in the city daily. With the new plants, the treating capacity would climb up to 110MLD. The official further added that the new plants can be expanded to treat more water. Treating grey or used water, which is 99% water and 1% waste, and releasing them into water bodies recharges the groundwater table and establishes circular water usage. Treated water from the Perungudi plant will be released into the Pallikaranai marshland and water from Nesappakkam plant will be released into Porur lake. The treated water from Kodungaiyur plant is being sold to industrial units in Ennore and Manali and that from Koyambedu plant is being sold to industrial units in Irugattukottai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-to-treat-20mld-more-water-from-march-with-2-new-plants/articleshow/86358255.cms||P Oppili

Speaking to reporters here today, Mustafa said, “Navjot Singh Sidhu is not a traitor. Captain Amarinder Singh is not authorised to certify who is is a traitor and who is a patriot. By calling Sidhu a traitor, Captain has actually targetted Rahul and Sonia Gandhi. I have not called Captain a traitor. Captain Amarinder Singh might be a nationalist but the army and police personnel can also be traitors.” He further said, “Captain can say whatever he wants to say about Sidhu but Sidhu is not a traitor. By saying that Sidhu has relations with Pakistan, Captain is targeting the Gandhi family. I cannot tolerate such remarks about the Gandhi family which made Sidhu whatever he is today.” Sidhu's advisor said that although the Congress 'tolerated' Captain Amarinder Singh for 4.5 years, if he would have been the party leader, he would have removed Singh in merely 30 days. "Captain Amarinder Singh has been humiliating Punjab for the last 5 years. The people in this party have been tolerating him for the last 4.5 years. If I was the leader of the party, then I would have removed Captain from the party in 30 days. Now if he speaks a word, I will come up with an entire book against him," added Mustafa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-capt-amranider-singhs-traitor-remark-attack-on-gandhis-says-navjot-singh-sidhus-advisor-mohammad-mustafa/articleshow/86358241.cms||---

Highlighting their plight, the homebuyers complained that there is a widespread delay in completion of affordable housing projects with poor monitoring and enforcement by the concerned department. They further claimed that the developers are arbitrarily demanding additional amount at the time of possession of their flats putting additional burden on them. Deepak Kumar, president of FABA and a resident of Pyramid Urban Homes said, “The affected buyers were not paid any compensation by the developers for delay in possession. The payment plan prescribed in policy for affordable housing projects is only time-linked and not based on construction pace giving an undue advantage to collect the amount and divert it to other use.” Moreover, the developers are collecting maintenance charges as the user charges of operational cost, they alleged. Manoj Yadav, a resident of AVL 36, said, “Developers are making their own interpretation and finding loopholes in the policy to exploit the homebuyers. We have requested the MLA to intervene on the matter as it is not only affecting us but is detrimental to affordable housing sectors in the absence of lack of clarity in the policy.” Meanwhile, Daultabad has assured the residents and homebuyers that he will take up the matter with the concerned department and authorities to resolve their grievances.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/builders-violating-norms-buyers-seek-help-from-mla/articleshow/86358269.cms||Akanksha Gupta

A couple Mitheelesh, 26, and his wife Meeradevi, 25, who were natives of Bihar worked in a private company in Ambattur Industrial Estate. They were staying in a rented house in Pattaravakkam with their two sons – one five-year-old and the other three-year-old. They used to lock their children at their home and one of their neighbours who had an alternative key would feed and take care of them. When the couple returned from work on Saturday evening, they found their younger son was missing. Mitheelesh lodged a complaint at the Ambattur Industrial Estate police station following which they formed special teams to trace the boy. Initial investigations found that the kid was last seen with G Shivkumar Noriya, 22, and R Monu Karpidass, 25, two migrant labourers who stayed a floor above the victim’s house. “The duo had taken the boy to Chennai central railway station. At the time three trains left to different cities and after analysing the list of passengers and CCTV footage, we found that they had boarded a Nagpur-bound train with the kid," a police officer said. The senior police officers contacted the railway police in Nagpur who nabbed the duo and rescued the boy on Sunday afternoon. A team of police from Chennai had gone to Nagpur to bring the boy and the accused back to the city. Police said that the duo had planned to sell the boy to a prospective family.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/boy-3-kidnapped-in-chennai-rescued-from-nagpur/articleshow/86358271.cms||---

As winters are just a couple of months away, the Gurugram administration has started gearing up to check pollution levels. It has decided to set up mobile squads and a control room that will keep tabs on garbage burning along the roads and check dust levels. The move comes a day after chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar held a video conference with officials of all the districts and directed them to take preventive measures within seven days as the harvest of paddy crop — spread over 34 lakh acres in Haryana — is set to start in a week. The districts were directed to ensure that the crop was harvested in a staggered manner. “We do not have crop burning issues in the district. But yes, we will definitely keep a tight watch on those burning garbage in the open. A control room will be set up in the DC office,” said Yash Garg, the deputy commissioner. Garg referred to measures taken during the monsoon to check urban flooding to assure that pollution levels could be tackled too during the winter. “During the rains this year, we took initiatives to ensure the city doesn’t get flooded. We could successfully prevent urban flooding in most parts and waterlogging was also tackled smoothly. In a similar way, we will handle air pollution too this year,” he added. At the meeting on Saturday, it was pointed out that Fatehabad, Kaithal, Jind, Karnal, Sirsa and Kurukshetra districts were in the red zone for the most number of farm fires last year while Jhajjar, Panipat, Sonipat and Rohtak were in yellow. These districts were asked to create at least one custom hiring centre (CHC) at each of the hotspot villages. These centres will provide machinery and equipment to farmers for harvesting the crop. Officials were also asked to regularly monitor 119 villages that fall in the red zone and 723 that are in yellow. “We aim to reduce the number of farm fires across the state and increase the area with zero stubble burning this year. We have deployed two officials for monitoring villages in the red category and one in the yellow category areas,” said an official from the agriculture department. The districts were also asked to carry out awareness campaigns against stubble burning and make available panchayat land for storing straw bales. A team of officials from the departments of pollution, revenue, panchayat, police and agriculture is being constituted at the village level to check crop residue burning. According to data compiled by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), September 2020 had seen the highest number of farm fires in Delhi-NCR in the past few years. In September of 2016, a total of 759 farm fires were recorded within the 400km radius of Delhi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/mobile-teams-in-gurugram-to-check-waste-burning-in-open/articleshow/86358353.cms||Ipsita Pati

Addressing Bharatiya Janata Party’s ‘Prabuddh Varg Sammelan’ in City South assembly area on Saturday evening, Irani said, “Prime Minister Narendra Modi accelerated the pace of development in the country and made many impossible things possible, but the family which ruled for five decades could do nothing for the development of the people of Amethi.” Highlighting the programmes and schemes of BJP governments at Centre and state, she said the previous government used to make claims about development and making the country a world leader without caring about the pride and respect of the poor. She praised the PM for caring for the needs of the poor on priority and providing toilets, drinking water and financial support to them. “During Covid-19 crisis, the PM ensured that no one goes to bed empty stomach and also arranged free vaccines for all,” Irani added. Speaking on the occasion, UP minister of state (independent charge) for tourism and religious affairs and local MLA Neelkanth Tiwari said City South has become the centre of development in Varanasi and a lot of work has been done in the old city area.

Previously, Pakistan progressed 39 places to secure 108th place on the ease of doing business global ranking, in the last two years. According to the Pakistani daily, the companies' registration through the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) has shown a 63 per cent growth.  Fareena Mazhar, Board of Investment (BoI) Secretary said that they were hopeful that the work which they were doing in regulatory reforms would provide an edge in terms of any future mapping criteria. One of the main things that Pakistan was hoping to capitalize on was the promulgation of commercial courts in Punjab province.  Last week, the World Bank Group decided to discontinue publication of its Doing Business report following allegations of irregularities. The decision was taken after a probe of data irregularities due to pressure by some top bank officials to boost China's ranking in 2017 came forth.  The Doing Business report assesses regulatory environments, ease of business startups, infrastructure and other business climate measures.  "After reviewing all the information available to date on Doing Business, including the findings of past reviews, audits, and the report the Bank released today (Thursday) on behalf of the Board of Executive Directors, World Bank Group management has taken the decision to discontinue the Doing Business report," it said in a statement posted on the website.  The probe of data irregularities cited 'undue pressure' by top bank officials, including then-Chief Executive Kristalina Georgieva, to boost China's ranking in 2017.  Georgieva, now the Managing Director of International Monetary Fund, and a key adviser pressured staff to 'make specific changes to China's data points' and boost its ranking at a time when the Bank was seeking China's support for a big capital increase.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/world-banks-call-to-discontinue-doing-business-report-irks-pakistan/articleshow/86358381.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Punjab: ‘Captain for 2022’ in February, ‘Team Channi’ in September||CHANDIGARH: Charanjit Singh Channi, who is set to become the new chief minister of Punjab, had till February been advocating outgoing chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh as the Congress’s face for the 2022 assembly elections in Punjab. While he might have had a different opinion on ground, his Facebook page reflected his apparent loyalty to the outgoing CM till February 19 this year, when he had used a posterlike photograph of ‘Captain for 2022’ as his profile picture. THEN & NOW: Channi posted the ‘Captain for 2022’ poster as the profile picture of his official Facebook page in February and replaced it in May; and (right) the CM-designate posted the Team Channi poster as a cover photo of the same page on September 10By posting the photo, Channi had thrown his weight behind the ‘Captain for 2022’ social media campaign which had been launched by the Punjab Congress, at the back of a winning performance in the civic body elections of the state. Channi replaced the profile picture in May. About a week ago, Channi changed the cover photo of his official Facebook handle to another poster-like photo. This time, the theme was ‘Team Channi’. A source in the Congress said Channi could have been just following the party state unit’s line when he posted the ‘Captain for 2022’ photo. “It is all about perception,” said the source who is an aide of an MP in Amarinder’s camp. In February, Sunil Jakhar, whose name was also doing the rounds for CM’s post, was heading the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee. Though he was earlier seen as an Amarinder loyalist, Channi had started to shift loyalty towards Sidhu by the time the latter had been made the Punjab Congress president on July 18. Channi, who was part of Amarinder’s ministerial cabinet, had even accused Punjab Police of allowing protesters to move close to Sidhu’s car during a visit to Chamkaur Sahib on July 24. He was also among the four ministers who had rebelled against the CM in August this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-capt-for-2022-in-february-team-channi-in-september/articleshow/86358428.cms||Siddarth Banerjee

---||World||Health officials back US FDA panel's decision on Covid booster shot||WASHINGTON: US health officials have voiced their support for the recommendation from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory panel that Covid-19 booster shots be limited to those 65 years and older and individuals at high risk, with some hoping for a broader use of the jabs at a later date. National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins told Fox News on Sunday that the guidance issued two days ago by the FDA panel is in line with what the US administration planned for a booster rollout, though not identical, reports Xinhua news agency. "I think there's less difference between where we were in the middle of August and what the advisory committee said this past Friday," he said. The administration announced in August that a rollout plan was being put in place for booster shots that would be initiated September 20, but also specified that the plan itself was pending recommendations from the FDA. The people eligible for a booster would be those who received their second dose six or eight months earlier. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told NBC News on Sunday that the plan initially announced by the White House is in line with the advisory panel's recommendation. Ultimately, he thought the "proper regimen" will include the original two shots plus a booster for everyone, though it may not be necessary right now. "You want to do that according to what the data tells you, including the risk-benefit ratio, particularly for the younger people who do not generally get as much severe disease as the elderly and others," Fauci said. "So, I believe that there's a good chance that as we get into the coming months, into the next year, that you will see the data pointing to the benefit of having a much broader blanket of people." A decision about boosters from the FDA is expected by this week, and an advisory committee of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is slated to meet on Wednesday and Thursday to recommend how a third shot should be used. The FDA advisory committee, following Pfizer's lead, recommended that the third shot be given at least six months after the second.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/health-officials-back-us-fda-panels-decision-on-covid-booster-shot/articleshow/86358803.cms||---

A few days back, Somaiya had accused Mushrif, the MLA from Kagal in Kolhapur, of indulging in corruption and holding 'benami' entities in the name of his kin, allegations dismissed as baseless by the latter. Somaiya, who boarded the Mahalaxmi Express in Mumbai on Sunday night to go to Kolhapur, in a tweet on Monday said, "Police stopped me at Karad under prohibitory order."

Somaiya had on Sunday claimed he was barred from entering Kolhapur with the district authorities citing law and order as well as security concerns following his allegations of corruption against Mushrif. Kolhapur Superintendent of Police Shailesh Balkawde told PTI that a team of district police reached Karad, and Somaiya was stopped at Karad railway station and served a copy of the (prohibitory) order. "After we told him that he was prohibited from entering the district, he cooperated and will now return after addressing a press conference in Karad," the official said. Somaiya on Sunday displayed an order from Kolhapur Collector Rahul Rekhawar that said the former had been prohibited from entering the district under section 144 of the IPC "in view of the threat to his life and possibility of law and order situation due to his visit". #WATCH | Maharashtra: BJP leader Kirit Somaiya detained at Karad Railway Station in Satara districtSomaiya was ex… https://t.co/fFdaoL0nIn— ANI (@ANI) 1632095537000The order also said the police would be occupied with Ganpati immersions and it would not be possible to provide security to Somaiya. Senior Inspector Sunil Kamble of Navghar police station in Mumbai had also issued a notice to Somaiya, asking him to follow the Kolhapur administration's order. Somaiya's residence at Mulund in Mumbai falls within the jurisdiction of Navghar police station. Somaiya had called the development as the "dadagiri" of the Uddhav Thackeray government. Maharashtra BJP chief Chandrakant Patil had termed the move "dictatorial" and said the Thackeray government would not be able to stifle Somaiya's voice. Patil had said the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government was trying to suppress the voice of Somaiya, who was exposing the "corrupt" ministers. The Delhi Police recently arrested terrorists who were planning to execute subversive activities in Mumbai, the BJP leader had said, alleging that "while terrorists roam freely under the MVA-led government, around 150 policemen surround the house of Somaiya".

Police said the accused was B Munusamy, from Avadi. He was an employee of a private company and his 11-year-old son is a Class VI student at a private school. On Saturday evening, the man shared sexually explicit photos and videos in the WhatsApp group consisting teachers, students and parents. The group was used to share notes from online classes and the boy used his father's mobile phone for the classes, police said. Other parents in the group approached the school management, which lodged a complaint with the Avadi police. Police said Munusamy told them that he was drunk and accidentally sent the content in the group instead of sending it to his friends. On Thursday, another man was arrested by the Neelankarai police for sharing sexually explicit content in his nephew’s school WhatsApp group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-man-held-for-posting-explicit-content-in-sons-school-group/articleshow/86359024.cms||---
---||India||Welfare of world possible in supreme glory of Hindu nation: RSS chief||JAIPUR: Mohan Bhagwat, the Sarsanghchalak of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh while addressing the intellectual community in Udaipur said that the welfare of the world was possible in the supreme glory of the Hindu nation. Explaining Hindutva in simple words, Bhagwat said, "The selfless service work done by the volunteers of the Sangh during the Corona period is Hindutva as there is a sense of well-being in it." Bhagwat was in Udaipur on Sunday and was speaking to around 300 people from different sections, including Leader of Opposition Gulab Chand Kataria. "The Hindu ideology signifies peace and truth. 'We are not Hindus' such a campaign is being run aiming at weakening the country and society. Problems have emerged where the Hindu population has decreased due to various reasons, so the Hindu organisation will become omnipresent and talk about the welfare of the world. The welfare of the world would be in the supreme glory of the Hindu nation," he added. Quoting the founder of the Sangh, Dr. Keshavrao Baliram Hedgewar, Bhagwat said, "He had realised that the diversity of India in appearance has a sense of unity at its core. We are all Hindus, descendants of ancestors who have lived in this holy land since ages. This is the spirit of Hinduism," Bhagwat said. Throwing light on the purpose, thought and methodology of the Sangh, the Sarsanghchalak said that the goal of the Sangh is person building (Vyakti Nirman). "Society building is possible through person building, country building is possible through society building. The Sangh works in the spirit of universal brotherhood. The whole world is his own for the Sangh. "Sangh has no desire to earn a name. Credit and popularity is also not needed by our association," he added. "The word Hindu was publicly avoided till the 80s, the Sangh worked in this adverse situation as well and today is the largest organisation in the world, despite facing the tough challenges in the early times. Sangh is an organisation of credible, trustworthy people of the society who do not differ in words and deeds," he added "The Sangh works in the spirit of universal brotherhood. The whole world is his own for the Sangh," he said further.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/welfare-of-world-possible-in-supreme-glory-of-hindu-nation-rss-chief/articleshow/86358480.cms||---

---||Bengaluru||Dial 1533 for all BBMP plaints; press 1 for Covid||BENGALURU: The BBMP has merged all its helplines into one. For all complaints and queries, including on Covid-19, one must now dial 1533. On dialling the four-digit toll-free number, callers will have to press 1 for Covid-19 related assistance and 2 to raise non-Covid grievances. Gaurav Gupta, chief commissioner of the civic agency, said, “During the peak of the first and second waves of the pandemic, we had borrowed the 1912 helpline number from Bescom. BBMP decided to have its own four-digit helpline.” From Covid emergencies to filing complaints about roads, waterlogging or fallen trees, citizens need to dial the new helpline for assistance. 1533 can take up to 20 Covid related calls (dial 1) and 10 non-Covid calls (dial 2) at a time. Between 10pm and 6 am, the capacity falls to 10 Covid-19 calls and five non-Covid calls simultaneously.  Officials said the capacity will be increased as per demand. As of now, BBMP will transfer all non-Covid related calls to its existing control room. Srinivas Alavilli from Janaagraha suggested the move is long overdue but indicated the number of lines is inadequate.  “It’s a good idea, but BBMP should be able to set up their response teams and centres quickly,” Alavilli said.  “Calls can be transferred to zonal-level response teams depending on the location of the caller. We are a megacity and hence the number of response teams and lines must be adequate. Just like a citizen can remember 108 and 100, 1533 is also an easy number to remember.” A few other municipal corporations across the country have the number 1533, but the call is routed to the civic body concerned depending on the caller’s geographical location. The helpline will cater to all queries related to Covid-19 such as information on vaccination and testing centres, bed blocking requests, details of Covid Care Centres and physical triaging centres, quarantine and home isolation information and details of primary health centres across the city. It also answers calls pertaining to information about ambulances and hearse van services. Palike officials said the ticket system will be used.  “Every call will be recorded and all information such as the reason for the call, time and if the issue has been resolved will be recorded. The caller will be given a ticket number and it will be closed only after the problem is resolved,” said an official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/dial-1533-for-all-bbmp-plaints-press-1-for-covid/articleshow/86359037.cms||Mrinalini Bhat

---||India||Mamata Banerjee among top frontrunners for PM in 2024: Babul Supriyo||KOLKATA: Former union minister Babul Supriyo, who recently joined Trinamool Congress (TMC) on Monday said that West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is among the top frontrunners for the prime ministerial post in 2024. "I want that the captain of our party Mamata Banerjee becomes the Prime Minister in 2024. Opposition plays an important role in a democratic system. Nobody can deny the fact that Mamata Banerjee is among the top frontrunners for the prime ministerial post," Supriyo told ANI. Notably, TMC's party mouthpiece 'Jaago Bangla' had recently sparked a row by saying Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has failed to become an alternative face to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It said West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is the potential alternative to Prime Minister Modi. Asked about why he switched to the TMC, Supriyo said, "I have not created any history by changing the party. A horde of leaders joined Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) from other parties before the West Bengal Assembly polls. There are resentments among the old leaders. BJP should ask them about their resentments." On post-poll violence, he said, "Post-poll violence is not desirable. It is being proved. I want that compensation should be provided to people who were affected by post-poll violence." The former Minister of State for Environment, Forest and Climate Change had on Saturday formally joined TMC had quit the BJP following the recent Union Cabinet reshuffle. The sitting MP joined the Trinamool family in the presence of National General Secretary Abhishek Banerjee and Rajya Sabha MP Derek O'Brien. After joining TMC, Supriyo had told ANI, "I accepted the opportunity given to me by Didi (Mamata Banerjee) and Abhishek. I left politics wholeheartedly and I am accepting the opportunity wholeheartedly. I met Abhishek Banerjee. The work to be done for Bengal was presented before me. I am excited. I want to work under the leadership of Didi. I will meet Didi on Monday." Earlier in August, BJP leader Babul Supriyo said he will continue to work constitutionally as a Member of Parliament but had withdrawn himself from active politics. "I will continue to work constitutionally as an MP in Asansol. Politics is beyond the constitutional post and I withdraw myself from it. I will not join any other party. I will vacate the MP bungalow in Delhi and release security personnel from their duties soon," Supriyo had told ANI. Supriyo had announced he was leaving politics and will also resign as an MP. He had stated that he would not join any political party and neither have the parties including the Trinamool Congress, CPI(M) or Congress called him. Babul Supriyo had resigned in August as minister of state for Environment, Forest and Climate Change. In a Facebook post, he said that there was a difference of opinion between him and the state BJP leaders and that the difference of opinion among senior leaders was "harming the party".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mamata-banerjee-among-top-frontrunners-for-pm-in-2024-babul-supriyo/articleshow/86358238.cms||---

Faced with the children’s “Chipko” protest, the civic team that is tasked with cutting the trees for a road-widening project, beats a hasty retreat. The students are protesting the Palike’s proposal to cut 40 trees on campus to widen a road in Abbigere. “We were taught to save and grow trees. But today, we stand here trying to save these 40 trees from being axed by the authorities. I want to ask the elders around me, are all lessons taught in school fake?” asked a teary-eyed student during a “Chipko” protest session. Besides taking turns to stage protest during school hours, students were devoting their physical education hours to the cause. They embraced trees or form cordons around the trunks, waving posters. For two days now, they are not staging daily protests but are determined to do so whenever the BBMP officials visit the campus. The movement began when the civic body sent the school headmistress a circular dated September 4, 2021, informing them of the proposed plan and seeking the authorities’ co-operation in acquiring school land for the project. A BBMP official, however, claimed that they are only acquiring a part of the school land and no tree will be cut. Randeep (name changed), who graduated from the school in 2008, told TOI that the road up for widening is already broad enough. “Some powerful people are trying to get 20 metres inside the school premises for the widening work. Daily, engineers visit the school asking for permission to cut the trees. The engineers have even tied strings around the trees to be cut,” he said, adding that the trees have provided green cover around the premises for years. Another student, Preeti, has even recorded a video message for CM Basavaraj Bommai, urging him to intervene and help save the trees. “Our seniors tell us that they walked long distance to water these saplings, which have now grown into these huge trees. But today, we are scared when the engineers come here and threaten to cut them,” she said. School authorities refused to react.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/schoolchildren-launch-chipko-like-stir-to-save-40-trees-on-campus/articleshow/86359181.cms||Farheen Hussain
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu: Memes best convey Covid message, say Tiruvallur cops||CHENNAI: The Tiruvallur police have been leveraging humour and social media to drive home the point that vaccination is the need of the hour. The social media team of the Tiruvallur police, which in the past used clips from popular movies to raise awareness about cyber attacks, bank fraud and safety-related issues, has in about two months created close to 100 memes to increase the number of people getting vaccinated. This meme is a take on the famous Goundamani-Senthil “Dei Thagappa” comedy from the film ‘Naatamai’. Meme translation: Dad... I told you we should get vaccinated. No one is willing to marry into an unvaccinated familyThe memes have gone viral with netizens liking, retweeting and commending police for their creativity. One meme, featuring yesteryear comedians Goundamani and Senthil, says, “Father, I told you that no one would agree to give their daughter’s hand in marriage if I am not vaccinated.” Another shows actor Vadivelu saying that the Tiruvallur district administration never allowed people without masks and vaccination. They are among the tools the district police have deployed, using social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to raise awareness about the pandemic to help people get vaccinated. Women constables N Muthulakshmi and B Shabrin say the idea came from Tiruvallur superinetendent of police R V Varun Kumar, focusing on intricate issues and situations through uncommon visuals and satirical texts. “This is easily accessible by every common person who uses social media sites,” said Muthulakshmi. Varun Kumar said Tiruvallur held the record of administering the highest number of vaccines after Chennai and Coimbatore in the mega drive conducted last Sunday. “Tiruvallur police memes are just another effort to help the district administration reach more people to vaccinate themselves. It is part of the awareness we are trying to create for the people,” he said. The district police’s Twitter account has 4,500 followers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tamil-nadu-memes-best-convey-covid-message-say-tiruvallur-cops/articleshow/86359266.cms||---

Students allege that details like unfilled vacancies of SC/ST students are not published on websites of many institutions, and SC/ST seats are being filled by conducting spot allotment simply by issuing short notice of one day in local pages of print media. Adishakthi Summer School, a tribal welfare organization, has written to the governor and education minister seeking action. “Though a mandatory reservation is ensured in the prospectus, the procedure for filling vacancies relating SC/ ST is kept vague or not transparent. No autonomous colleges in Ernakulam are following SC/ST special allotment procedure in a transparent way, as followed by the Mahatma Gandhi University (MGU). Unfilled vacancies of SC/ST are not published on their website, while every other matter relating to college admission is published on their website. As the procedure followed is not transparent, the opportunity for aspiring students, especially scheduled tribe students, are denied the opportunity of availing mandatory reservations,” said Mary Lydia, coordinator of Adishakthi Summer School. A majority of the tribal students are hailing from faraway places like Wayanad, Attapady, Idukki and other forest areas. By not publishing the number of seats remaining for SC/ST on the website transparently, the constitutional rights of several SC/ST students, especially adivasi students, are being denied by institutions. The letter to the governor, who is the chancellor of state varsities, and education minister, seeks to issue necessary guidelines to all autonomous colleges to reopen the final phase of spot allotment publishing the data relating to SC/ST on the website if the allotment procedure was concluded without following the rules. Lydia said that SC/ST special allotment that would ensure statutorily mandated reservation for dalit and adivasi students was carried out properly only in Calicut University and MGU. However, SC/ST students are not granted adequate time to register and complete their applications. “The time frame often is as little as 36 hours. Such a short window makes it infeasible for students hailing from remote areas and vulnerable backgrounds to participate in. Hence the government should issue a directive to the universities to conduct the registration process for at least 5-7 days,” she said. Another issue raised by tribal students is the conversion of SC/ST seats to the general category practiced by universities and autonomous colleges. “It is unconstitutional and takes opportunity away from already vulnerable students from pursuing higher education. We request the government to give directives to all universities and autonomous colleges to not convert SC/ST seats to other categories till the last stage of the admission process,” said Lydia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/tribal-students-in-kerala-struggling-to-get-admission-in-colleges/articleshow/86359188.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: GMCH to go back to normal||CHANDIGARH: Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, will start physical OPDs from Monday. All those who have taken the first dose of Covid vaccine or have a negative RT-PCR report 72 hours before the visit will be exempted from rapid antigen testing. “We have been testing over 500 samples daily for the OPDs. When the patients’ inflow will increase and manpower focused in OPDs, testing will reduce. So, the condition of vaccination and RTPCR has been introduced,” said a faculty member. GMCH was the first hospital where health care workers were infected during the first wave. The hospital was immediately shut and OPDs were based on teleconsultation. Since then, the physical OPDs were not resumed. “Only those patients were called for physical examination assessed by doctors after teleconsultation. This was not satisfactory both for patients and doctors,” said a faculty. The GMCH will, however, continue its online appointment, but reduce the intake of eight patients per hour per day. “We will give preference to those who walk-in. The appointment shall be convenient to the ones who come from outside the state,” said the faculty member. Doctors have a barricade in their consultation room, while there are barricades at the fee and test counters. “But it will not be possible to enable social distancing. We had to open the OPDs now after the decline in Covid cases to provide routine services to all,” said director-principal, Prof Jasbinder Kaur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/chandigarh-gmch-to-go-back-to-normal/articleshow/86359484.cms||Shimona Kanwar
---||Chandigarh||No interim charge for senior-most doctor once PGI head exits||CHANDIGARH: While PGI director Dr Jagat Ram will be completing his five-year term by the end of the next month, the senior-most faculty member in the institute will not get the interim charge until the new director is selected, according to sources in the health ministry. Chances of one of the directors from AIIMS in Bilaspur or Bathinda getting additional charge from November 1 are high. Prof G D Puri, dean, academics, and Prof A K Gupta, dean, research and medical superintendent are the seniormost at the most. While Puri will retire after eight months, Gupta after four months. “The selection of the new director will take four to six months. In the meantime, either the present director will get an extension or there will be an additional charge to any of the AIIMS’ directors,” said an official in the ministry. “It has been a norm that the senior-most faculty is given the charge till the new director is appointed. However, this is not a fixed rule and the Union minister of health and family welfare can authorise anyone, even from outside PGI to take charge,” said an official in the ministry. The PGI has already issued an advertisement for the selection of the director who has to be nominated by vicechancellors of universities, directors of centers/institutions of medical education and research, members of the institute body of PGI and principals of all medical colleges. A committee scrutinises the applications and the shortlisting is done after an interview by the search and selection committee. The top three names are sent to the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet chaired by the Prime Minister.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/no-interim-charge-for-senior-most-doctor-once-pgi-head-exits/articleshow/86359540.cms||Shimona Kanwar
---||Chennai||Chennai: 500m stretch at Kelambakkam turns OMR traffic bottleneck||CHENNAI: Offices and educational institutions along OMR are resuming work and traffic snarls have begun paralysing Kelambakkam again. A stretch of OMR that is barely 500m long and passes through the busy Kelambakkam market area continues to be a bottleneck for road users as the six-lane IT Corridor (Rajiv Gandhi Expressway) narrows down at this junction, leading to vehicles getting piled up for long distances in both directions during peak hours. Now, as a temporary solution, the authorities plan to throw open a portion of an unfinished bypass at Padur on OMR soon to divert traffic. Two-wheelers encroaching upon the carriageway on either side of the road further shrink the motorable space, leading to traffic moving at a snail's pace. The lifeline linking the city with Thiruporur, the junction records a huge movement of vehicles including buses belonging to MTC, private colleges and companies. According to sources in the Tamil Nadu Road Development Company (TNRDC), which laid OMR and maintains it, the stretch on an average records a daily movement of 60,000 vehicles. Of these, two-wheelers and cars account for about 35,000 and the rest are MTC buses, buses of private colleges and institutions and heavy vehicles. Unless something is done fats, regular road users say, the traffic situation could worsen into that prevalent during pre-Covid times when vehicles are clogged during office hours in the morning and evenings. “Once all the IT sector employees return to their offices, it would lead to acute traffic snarls. The problem is only on the 500 metre stretch,” said S Dillibabu, an auto rickshaw driver said. The laying of a bypass linking Padur near Kelambakkam and Kalavakkkam around Thiruporur, which commenced five years ago, is stuck in issues of land acquisition, with only three km of the 13-km-long road completed. Kuppan, a resident of Padur, said work on the bypass been completed within the scheduled time, Kelambakkam would not have suffered due to traffic. “The deserted road is used by a few for illegal bike racing,” he said. Pieces of broken liquor bottles can be found at one end of the completed portion. When contacted, official sources in the TNRDC said that a portion of the 13-km bypass would be thrown open for traffic in a week. “This three kilometre portion of the bypass road linking Padur with Kelambakkam-Kovalam Road will reduce the traffic burden at Kelambakkam Junction as 25% of the vehicles can be diverted,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-500m-stretch-at-kelambakkam-turns-omr-traffic-bottleneck/articleshow/86359475.cms||Yogesh Kabirdoss

---||World||Pakistan must recognise Taliban govt, insists PDM chief Fazlur Rehman||ISLAMABAD: Pakistan should recognise the Taliban government at the earliest to help ensure a stable country in the neighbourhood, said country's opposition leader and Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman. "We should recognise the Taliban government at the earliest to cooperate in efforts being made for ensuring a peaceful country and a stable (governance) system in Afghanistan," Dawn quoted Fazlur Rehman as saying while citing Geo News TV. This comment comes as the international community and UN agencies are keeping a close eye on the Taliban and its conduct in the troubled country. Some are even slamming the initial policy decisions taken by the outfit that goes against the rights of the minority and women. The opposition leader argued in favour of recognising the Taliban government, saying when China and Russia were taking interest in establishing ties with the new Afghan rulers, then they should also maintain its contacts with the outfit. "We have historic relations with the Afghan people and we should help them in introducing peace and a stable system there." He added that recognising the Taliban government is like recognising Afghanistan. Last Saturday, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan informed that his government has started negotiations with the Taliban to form an inclusive government in Afghanistan. His remarks came following the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting held in Dushanbe, where SCO members thoroughly discussed issues associated with Afghanistan. This week, members of the international community are set to meet at United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). Leaders and other participants are slated to hold discussions on this crisis.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/pakistan-must-recognise-taliban-govt-insists-pdm-chief-fazlur-rehman/articleshow/86359664.cms||---
