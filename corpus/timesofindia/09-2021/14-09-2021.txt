He also spiked the department’s claim that the vehicle’s documents were not produced on demand. Referring to the recent drive by the transport authorities against top-end cars registered outside Karnataka, Farookh said RTO officials had intercepted the car that was being driven by his daughter on August 22 and made her wait for more than an hour despite producing necessary documents. None of the vehicles was seized and it was an apparent act of dereliction of duty, high-handedness and harassment on the part of the RTO authorities, he alleged. Farookh said the car (MH-02 FF-5555) is used for his travel in Maharashtra, where he has business activities, and is occasionally brought to Bengaluru. The vehicle’s lifetime tax had been paid and the insurance and emission certificates are valid, he claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/mlc-says-depts-claims-about-his-ferrari-false/articleshow/86180273.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Domestic wild meat use increases risk of zoonotic disease: Report||NAGPUR: The taking of animals for wild meat consumption within national borders has significant impact on most terrestrial species protected under the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS), according to a new report released on Tuesday. The report is the first of its kind and covered 105 CMS species. The report found that wild meat is often a key use and a major driver for legal and illegal hunting, particularly of ungulates and primates, and especially during times of conflict or famine and in the course of land-use change. This has led to drastic declines and extinctions of several migratory terrestrial mammal populations. The report states that 70% of hunted CMS terrestrial mammal species are used for wild meat consumption, and 67 of the 105 species studied were recorded as hunted. Of these 67 species, the largest intended use (47 species) was for wild meat consumption. Other hunting purposes identified were for cultural reasons, medicinal use, human-wildlife conflict, unintentional take, and sport/trophy hunting/fashion. Global attention to wildlife taking has largely focused on international trade. However, the report found that the vast majority of taking of CMS species for wild meat consumption is driven by direct use or domestic trade. This has major implications for international and national efforts to protect vulnerable and endangered species. Overall, 34 of 99 species with an IUCN Red List Assessment were reported as used at the subsistence level (direct use), 27 were traded nationally, and 22 were traded internationally, when all types of use were considered. However, when only meat for consumption was considered, 27 species (out of 99) were reported as consumed for subsistence, 10 species for the national wild meat trade and only two species for the international wild meat trade. CMS executive secretary Amy Fraenkel noted, “This report indicates for the first time a clear and urgent need to focus on domestic use of protected migratory species of wild animals, across their range. We need to ensure that domestic laws and enforcement efforts are able to tackle this major threat to CMS species.” The report also examined the link between the taking of species for wild meat with the risk of zoonotic diseases. There is strong evidence that zoonotic disease outbreaks are linked to human activities. Wild meat taking and consumption has been identified as the direct and causative agent for the spill-over into humans for Monkeypox virus, SARS, Sudan Ebola virus, and Zaire Ebola virus, with subsequent human-to-human transmission. In total, 60 zoonotic viral pathogens were reported as hosted by the 105 migratory species studied. “As we seek to shift towards sustainable global food systems, it is critical that the use of wild species for food, is both legal and sustainable. The Covid-19 pandemic has taught us that the overexploitation of nature comes at a heavy cost. We urgently need to depart from business-as-usual. In so doing, we can save many species from the brink of extinction and protect ourselves from future outbreaks of zoonotic diseases,” said Inger Andersen, executive director of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP). The study cited a number of factors for the unsustainable taking. First, national legislation and regulations may lack clarity or are outdated, not reflecting the actual requirements of environmental factors, population traits, and dynamics of the species concerned. Second, poor enforcement is a key driver of unsustainable use in several regions. Third, civil conflict and land-use change can drive increased taking for wild meat. Fourth, migratory animals across countries and regions with a wide variety of different laws and enforcement approaches, increasing the risk of unsustainable take at different stages of their migration. Finally, growing urbanization and increased sale of wild meat as a luxury product is additional pressure on protected animals. The report also found that seasonal migration patterns mean migratory species are a particularly susceptible target for hunters, poachers, and other consumers due to the well-known timing of the species’ arrival in a particular area. It is important to note that wildlife contributes to food security, health, income, jobs, and cultural identity of many rural economies and for some of the world’s most vulnerable Indigenous Peoples & Local Communities (IPLCs). Any policy response needs to consider such uses, as well as the drivers of food insecurity. Hunting (for all purposes) is reported as a key threat to the survival of many species. Excluding bats (Chiroptera), the study finds that 98% (41 out of 42) of the CMS species with an IUCN Red List Assessment are threatened by hunting. Hunting threatens 95% (21 out of 22) of those that are classified by IUCN as Endangered, Critically Endangered, or Extinct in the Wild. The study documented linkages between hunting and the declining population trends of several species. Around 77% (40 out of 52) of the CMS species that were assessed by IUCN as having decreasing populations were recorded as threatened by hunting in this study. For instance, most migratory ungulates still extant in the wild have experienced significant population declines that can be attributed to hunting. All chimpanzee subspecies and three of the four gorilla subspecies reported as significantly threatened by hunting are also experiencing large population declines. Overall, the assessment of the report finds that taking has a direct impact on the populations of more than half (58 out of 105) of the studied species, with high impacts for at least 42% (40 out of 105) of them. The study also found that there is insufficient data for a conclusive assessment on the taking of bats, which make up half of the CMS terrestrial mammal species studied. This could signal that they are either infrequently hunted, or that their hunting is being underreported. Carnivore and elephant species are hunted for many different uses and disaggregating the impact of wild meat hunting from hunting for trophies or human-wildlife conflict is often not possible. While wild meat can be an important source of nutrition for rural communities, it does not often play a significant role in food security for urban dwellers, for whom it is a luxury item. Yet as urban populations grow, so does the demand for wild meat. Even low per capita consumption rates can add up to large total quantities of wild meat consumed, and urban demand is fueling increasing unsustainable offtakes in surrounding areas, contributing to heavier pressure on wildlife and a larger threat to the food supply of wildlife-dependent rural communities. Recommendations & Implications For Future * Greater attention to domestic use and trade of CMS species is needed to address threats to conservation * Capacity for monitoring and enforcement should be examined and strengthened * The drivers contributing to the illegal or unsustainable use of wildlife for domestic consumption should be further identified and addressed * Understanding more about the spillover risks associated with wild meat use and trade, and the factors that might increase or decrease these risks * Additional international cooperation will be needed to address wild meat taking of migratory species, whose ranges span multiple countries||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/domestic-wild-meat-use-increases-risk-of-zoonotic-disease-report/articleshow/86215672.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

Several institutions have decided not to insist on school uniforms for various reasons. Most children have outgrown them after 1.7 years. While some schools feel it is meaningless to ask students to get new ones as they don’t know when campuses will close again, others are giving them time. “Children have outgrown the uniforms and it looks awkward when they wear them. So, we have asked our PU students not to wear uniforms at all. Our PU attendance is the lowest among all grades — 35%. As students have always disliked wearing uniforms, we do not want to create another hindrance for them to come to class. For lower grades too, we do not insist. But we see a lot of students enthusiastically wearing uniforms,” said BR Suprit, Oxford institutions, Ullal. D Shashi Kumar, secretary of Association of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka, said: “We recommend our member schools not to insist on uniforms because we don’t know when they will have to close again. Also, getting a service provider on campus and getting uniforms stitched is a long process. We want to focus on academic activities.” Natesh Kumar, principal, Gurukula International School, said while a majority of their children come in their old uniform, the school does not want to force the others. “Many parents might be in a financial crisis and do not want to overburden them,” he said. Some schools want to bring back uniforms on campuses. “Uniform is important as it helps avoid discrimination between the rich and poor. While students are coming in their old uniforms, we have asked them to place order. The tailor has said it is difficult to procure raw materials for such a small number of children. If he procures them for some, he may not get the same colour in the next order. So we have decided to wait,” said Girish S A, founder president, Kaveri Vidyakshetra, Singasandra. “My daughter’s school reopened on Monday and the uniform did not fit her. I had to alter the old one before sending her,” said a mother of a student in Basavanagudi. Vendors said orders have started coming in, but in smaller numbers than before. “We have our stock from the past, which was ready before the first lockdown,” said Anuj Bhandari, MD, DAC Inc, which is in the business of supplying school uniforms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/uniforms-missing-on-some-campuses-as-children-outgrow-them-in-1-7-years/articleshow/86180409.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas

Narayanappa worked as an electrician in a private company in Nelamangala of Bengaluru and was a resident of Baddihalli. On Sunday, he picked up a quarrel with his wife Annapoorna over her alleged affair with Ramakrishna, police said. Heated arguments took place between the husband and wife. In a fit of rage, Annapoorna threw petrol on her husband and set him ablaze. In order to save his life, Narayanappa ran out of the house and fell into the drainage to put out the fire. Ramakrishna, who was also present in the house, took a stone and dropped it on Narayanappa’s head when he was trying to escape from the drainage. He suffered severe head injuries and died instantly. Jayanagara police arrested the duo. ‘Used petrol stored to light firewood’Narayanappa and Annapoorna, who had three children, frequently fought over her affair, sources said. Annapoorna had stored petrol in a bottle to light firewood in the house and emptied it on her husband before setting him ablaze. Annapoorna, 36, works as a labourer at an onion mandi while Ramakrishna, 35, is a painter and money lender. The couple's three daughters were at home when the incident happened. The eldest daughter, about 14 years old, was a witness to the whole incident. The younger 12-year-old twins were in the room. Narayanappa suffered severe burns , police said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/wife-burns-man-lover-kills-him-with-boulder/articleshow/86180412.cms||---

On September 5, three thieves were arrested in Aragaladevi reserve forest of Aragalagudda Kaval, Gubbi taluk. Murthy, Mallappa and Krishna were from Krishnagiri and Dharmapuri districts in Tamil Nadu and were part of a 15-member gang which had entered the forest. Murthy was injured after range forest officer BH Duggappa opened fire in self-defence when he tried to attack him with a sickle. On August 21, Shivaraj, 30, of Metaradoddi of Ramanagara district was killed when foresters opened fire in Kenkere reserve forest of Kunigal taluk. Environmentalist BV Gundappa said without support from locals, it is not possible for a gang from Tamil Nadu to come and cut sandalwood trees in the district. Retired deputy conservator of forests Nagendra BS Rao said: “Locals find out places where sandalwood trees are grown, establish links with sandalwood smugglers and thieves and tip them off about their location.” Gundappa said the forest department does not have enough vehicles and modern weapons to protect their staff. “Vehicles are provided only to range forest officers, assistant conservators of forests and deputy conservators of forests,” he said, adding that they are left to fend for themselves with double-barrel guns from the British era.  Sandalwood from Tumakuru and Chikkamagaluru is supplied to oil extraction factories at Amarapuram in Andhra Pradesh. The trees are smuggled through Hiriyur of Chitradurga district. Rao said unlike Karnataka, in many states, factories are given permission to extract sandalwood oil but in Karnataka. A countrywide uniform law is needed to prevent poaching , he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/sandalwood-thieves-on-prowl-in-tkuru/articleshow/86180414.cms||---

---||India||Ambala: Complaint filed on behalf of Lord Ram, 2 booked for hurting religious sentiments||AMBALA: Haryana police booked two persons for allegedly hurting religious sentiments on the basis of a complaint, filed on behalf of Lord Ram by a resident of Naraingarh town in Ambala district, on Monday.  Raghav Sanjeev Gharoo of Naraingarh filed a complaint as a next friend of “Lord Ram, son of King Dashrath of Ayodhya in Faizabad district of Uttar Pradesh”, on the basis of which the Ambala police booked Jung Bahadur of Jind district in Haryana and Manish Chohan of Sangrur district in Punjab under Section 295 (injuring or defiling place of worship with intent to insult the religion) and 298 (uttering words with deliberate intent to wound the religious feelings) of the Indian Penal Code, on Monday.  Raghav alleged that accused Jung and Manish intentionally insulted the complainant (Lord Ram) by making derogatory and baseless remarks and statements with intent to provoke breach of the peace, thereby causing public mischief and wilfully hurting religious sentiments of the society, especially of the worshipers of the complainant.  "That Shri Ram Chander is a lawful person and Raghav Sanjeev is Hindu by religion, so he wants to represent the deity as the next friend of Shri Ram Chander. Shri Ram Chander was a very famous king of Ayodhya and no description is needed for the purpose of identifying the subject matter of the dispute,” read Raghav’s complaint.  He told police that on May 10, he had made a post on Facebook, "Those people who do not believe in Shri Ram or Ramayana, what will they know about Valmiki Ji? Such people are distributing knowledge in the name of Valmiki."  "Both Jung Bahadur and Manish Chohan posted disrespectful comments on Lord Ram and his father Dashrath,” alleged Raghav.  This complaint was earlier filed with Cyber Crime Cell, Panchkula, on June 12.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ambala-complaint-filed-on-behalf-of-lord-ram-2-booked-for-hurting-religious-sentiments/articleshow/86180154.cms||JK Singh
---||World||Blinken tells irate Congress the US was ready on Afghanistan||WASHINGTON: US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday insisted that the Biden administration had prepared for worst-case scenarios in Afghanistan as irate lawmakers accused the White House of presiding over a historic disaster. The famously even-tempered US diplomat is facing two days of grilling by congressional committees, the first opportunity by lawmakers to directly challenge President Joe Biden's administration over his end to the 20-year war that brought a swift victory to the Taliban. Blinken told the House Foreign Affairs Committee that the Biden administration was "intensely focused" on the safety of Americans and had been "constantly assessing" the staying power of the Western-backed government. "Even the most pessimistic assessments did not predict that government forces in Kabul would collapse while US forces remained," Blinken said. "Nonetheless, we planned and exercised a wide range of contingencies," he said. "The evacuation itself was an extraordinary effort -- under the most difficult conditions imaginable -- by our diplomats, by our military, by our intelligence professionals." Blinken said that prior planning made it possible to draw down the embassy within 48 hours, and secure the airport and start evacuations within 72 hours. The United States and its allies ultimately evacuated 124,000 people out of Afghanistan, one of the largest airlifts in history. The administration says only around 100 US citizens remain and that all had been contacted repeatedly by US diplomats, with some leaving after the withdrawal in line with promises by the Taliban. Lawmakers of the rival Republican party, seeing a vulnerability for Biden, have portrayed the operation as chaotic and accused the president of abandoning Americans to the fate of the Taliban. "This was an unmitigated disaster of epic proportions," said Representative Mike McCaul, the top Republican on the committee. "I never thought in my lifetime that I would see an unconditional surrender to the Taliban," he said. Former president Donald Trump had agreed in February 2020 to the withdrawal and Blinken's predecessor Mike Pompeo met the Taliban to finalize the deal, which however set conditions for US forces to leave. "We inherited a deadline; we did not inherit a plan," Blinken said. But McCaul accused the Biden administration of ignoring US generals and intelligence and accused the United States of a "betrayal" of its Afghan allies. He pointed out that the Taliban's caretaker government includes figures wanted by the United States including the new interim interior minister Sirajuddin Haqqani, whose arrest is sought by Washington on terrorism allegations. "We are now at the mercy of the Taliban's reign of terror," McCaul said, warning of a "dark veil of sharia law" as the Taliban reinstitute their draconian treatment of women. Blinken said the Taliban had violated terms of Trump's deal but that Biden faced a choice of carrying out a pullout or sending "substantially more" US troops into harm's way, perpetuating America's longest war. "There's no evidence that staying longer would have made the Afghan security forces or the Afghan government any more resilient or self-sustaining," Blinken said. "If 20 years and hundreds of billions of dollars in support, equipment and training did not suffice, why would another year, another five, another 10?" Representative Gregory Meeks, the Democrat who led the committee, accused Republicans of having been silent when Trump and Pompeo pursued the same policies on Afghanistan. "Disentangling ourselves from Afghanistan was never going to be easy," Meeks said. "I would welcome hearing what exactly a smooth withdrawal from a messy, chaotic 20-year war looks like," he said. "I don't believe one exists."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/no-evidence-that-staying-longer-would-have-made-any-difference-in-afghanistan-says-antony-blinken/articleshow/86180198.cms||---

The two are believed to be holding negotiations with the principal opposition party to thrash out issues before making an entry. Sources said the negotiations between Kanhaiya Kumar, who had contested the 2019 Lok Sabha election on a CPI ticket, are having parleys with the Congress leaders. The date and modalities of his joining the party have not been decided yet, the sources added. Kanhaiya Kumar lost to Union minister Giriraj Singh from the Begusarai constituency in Bihar by a massive margin of more than 4.22 lakh votes. He had secured 22 per cent of the vote share while Giriraj Singh bagged an unassailable 56.5 per cent of the vote share. The Congress believes that if Kumar joins the party, a dramatic change might come about in the opposition in the coming days. Chances are that a meeting between Kanhaiya Kumar and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi may be arranged if all goes well. Subsequently, he may join the party, the sources said. Kanhaiya Kumar has been maintaining a low profile ever since he lost to Giriraj Singh but is now likely to launch fresh political innings in Congress. According to news agency ANI, a top Congress source said that including Kanhaiya in the Congress is under serious consideration at the top level of the party, but it has not yet been finalised how and when he will join. The Congress believes that the joining could be significant at a time when the party is facing a leadership crisis with no big faces to attract the masses. Kumar is considered to be a crowd-puller, especially among youth. But the Congress needs to consider how this will be viewed by its ally the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD). Besides Kanhaiya Kumar, the talks for induction of poll strategist Prashant Kishor in the Congress are also in an advanced stage. There are indications that he may join as part of a special AICC panel if there is a positive outcome of his negotiations. Congress president Sonia Gandhi is seized of the issue and sources said there has not been any discussion on Kishor since July, a period during which the party was busy with the monsoon session of Parliament as well as other developments, mostly firefighting in its state units. If the high-profile poll strategist joins Congress, sources said it will not be a plain induction announcing his arrival, but is likely to be put out in public as part of a special committee of the AICC. Kishor has asked Congress leadership to form an “empowered group” to make decisions on the party’s strategy and election management. Kishore’s entry into Congress will be with the sole focus of the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. He may also be part of future contests in the states, but he’s likely to keep away from the coming batch of elections in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Goa, and Manipur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/talks-in-progress-to-induct-kanhaiya-kumar-in-congress-may-meet-rahul-gandhi/articleshow/86180382.cms||---

After two rounds of centralized counselling for admissions in various undergraduate courses, 80-85 per cent seats were filled in government colleges of Indore, while private colleges are lagging behind with 50 per cent seats filled. Private colleges are hopeful that candidates will take admission after CET result is declared as around 14000 candidates had appeared for the common entrance test for just 3000 seats . Although, as per the schedule of the DHE, this year the department hadn’t scheduled third round of counselling instead College Level Counselling (CLC) round. However, Private Collegiate Principals Association has put forth the demand to the Directorate of Higher Education (DHE) to either keep the CLC round without any restriction of merit list or consider third round of counselling owing to less number of admissions in the colleges. The association president Dr Rajeev Jhalani said, “In Indore, around 55 per cent seats have been filled in various private colleges. We have submitted memorandum to the officials of higher education department to either remove the additional criteria of merit list in CLC or give a third round. He also added that the city-based colleges are now waiting for the DAVV’s CET results too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/pvt-colleges-pin-hope-on-cet-results-to-get-vacant-seats-filled/articleshow/86180300.cms||Laveena Francis

The result of the examination was announced by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) on Monday. The exam, which was held in July, was taken by 83,606 candidates and all the top ranks have been bagged by girls from across the country. The first and second rankers are Nandini Agrawal (Morena) and Sakhshi Airan (Indore) in Madhya Pradesh, respectively. Sakshi, 22, a Chamarajpet resident, told TOI that the CA process requires a student to give his or her 100% at all levels. Though she is yet to decide on her next step, Sakshi said she will take some time to absorb the feeling of achievement, which is a result of relentless hard work and sacrifices. “If you must study for something like CA, you cannot afford to have any distractions. Even though I am an avid social media user, I deactivated all my accounts in January 2020 and completely focused on studies,” said Sakshi, adding that she’d only activate her accounts around festivals or important events to post pictures. But when exams neared, Sakshi studied for 10 hours every day. The 2020 lockdown proved to be a blessing in disguise for the topper, as it gave her more time to plan and study. “I was doing my internship then and saved commute time,” she added. However, the 2021 lockdown gave her jitters as the exam got postponed. “I had put in months of preparation. The uncertainty was unsettling. The exam was postponed with no dates ahead,” said Sakshi. Asked what was the secret behind her success, Sakshi was candid. “I had no other option but to succeed. That is how I saw it. If one could spend 8 to 10 hours in office, I could also spend the same amount of time to study for my dream,” she said, adding that she balanced her studies with sufficient sleep.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bluru-girl-bags-all-india-rank-3-in-ca-final-exam/articleshow/86180928.cms||Farheen Hussain

The suspended inspector was Govindasamy, who was attached to Vaniyambadi town police station. DIG (Vellore), who placed the inspector under suspension, also directed DSP (Vaniyambadi) to submit a detailed report on the incident. SP (Tirupattur) M R Sibi Chakravarthi was transferred before the murder. On Friday, MJK state joint secretary Wasim Akram, 43, of Jeeva Nagar in Vaniyambadi, a former elected member to a local body was returning home from a mosque when a seven-member gang in a car attacked him with sharp weapons, killing him. Preliminary investigations revealed that the leader of a local ganja peddling gang identified as Imthiyas, an iron merchant, was the mastermind behind the crime. Imthiyas believed that Akram tipped off police about his drug peddling activities and a police team, which raided his house and go-down, seized 9kg ganja, three knives and 10 mobile phones and arrested his three aides including one Faisel on July 26. The team was on the lookout for Imthiyas and two others involved in the crime. Imthiyas, who was on the run, wanted to take revenge on Akram and engaged hitmen to eliminate him following which an armed gang murdered him on Friday. A police team intercepted an SUV on Saturday and detained the two occupants of the vehicle, who attempted to flee. The team seized the SUV, and 11 knives from their possession. The arrested were identified as Prasad from Vandalur in Chengalpet district and 'Delhi' Kumar from Mannivakkam near Chennai.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/inspector-suspended-after-murder-of-mjk-worker/articleshow/86181040.cms||Bosco Dominique

Speaking after formally upgrading Pondicherry Engineering College into Puducherry Technological University on Monday, Naidu emphasized the importance of research and development (R&D) in all spheres of national development.  "If you look around the world, you will find that it is the cutting-edge research in science, technology and other fields that puts developed countries ahead of the rest. If we have to make India a developed nation, we will have to create an enabling ecosystem for researchers. I urge educational institutions to have an increased interface with the industry to promote result-oriented research that addresses the contemporary challenges such as climate change, pollution, health and poverty," Naidu said. Claiming that India is scaling new heights in entrepreneurship and innovation, Naidu said India has the third-largest start-up ecosystem. "Data from the department of promotion of industry and internal trade suggests that we have over 50,000 startups spread across 623 districts in the country. In the year 2020-21 itself, over 16,000 startups were recognized. With the government opening up the space sector for private players, more than 40 tech startups are working in the field of satellites, launch vehicles and other space-based applications. It is a matter of great joy to know that leadership teams of 45% of startups have a woman entrepreneur. This is a healthy trend which will inspire more women to become entrepreneurs," he said. Naidu said the strength of new India is that 54% of the Indians are below 25 years. He outlined the government's measures to support startups including broadening definitions, simplifying regulations and providing tax exemptions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/puducherry/vice-president-stresses-on-enabling-ecosystem-for-researchers-in-india/articleshow/86181085.cms||---

Justice M Nirmal Kumar, reserving orders on a petition filed by the AIADMK leaders on Monday, said it would be valid till the judgment is delivered. The issue pertains to a defamation complaint moved by Va Pugazhendi, former spokesperson of AIDAMK, against Panneerselvam and Palaniswami in their capacity as the coordinator and joint coordinator, respectively, of the party. He alleged that while removing him from the party arbitrarily, the two leaders had made certain observations in a press statement, that brought disrepute to his standing. After being summoned to appear before the special court for MLAs and MPs, the two moved the high court contending that being the coordinator and joint coordinator of the party, they have powers to take disciplinary actions against erring members and exercising such legitimate authority will not amount to defamation. The action taken against Pugazhendi is similar to that of actions taken by companies against employees involved in fraudulent activities. “Daily we see public notices published in newspapers warning the public against dealing with employees who have been involved in fraudulent activities. If such actions are considered as defamation then such companies would face thousands of such cases,” they said. They argued that the complainant has not disclosed any material in his complaint for offence under section 499 of IPC. AIADMK has rules and regulations and violation of such rules would attract termination of membership. This cannot be construed as defamation, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/hc-dispenses-with-appearance-of-ops-and-eps-in-court/articleshow/86181105.cms||---

Nearly all of the state’s coastline was under a tropical storm warning that included potential flash floods and urban flooding. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said authorities placed rescue teams and resources in the Houston area and along the coast. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center in Miami said the system’s top sustained winds reached 60 mph (95 kph). If the winds hit 74 mph, the storm would become a Category 1 hurricane. It was moving north at 12 mph (19 kph) on a track to pass near the South Texas coast later in the day, then move onshore in the evening. In flood-prone Houston, officials worried that heavy rain expected to arrive late Monday and early Tuesday could inundate streets and flood homes. Authorities deployed high-water rescue vehicles throughout the city and erected barricades at more than 40 locations that tend to flood, Mayor Sylvester Turner said. “This city is very resilient. We know what we need to do. We know about preparing,” said Turner, referencing four major flood events that have hit the Houston area in recent years, including devastating damage from Harvey. Several schools in the Houston and Galveston areas were closed Monday because of the incoming storm. The Houston school district, the state’s largest, announced that classes would be canceled on Tuesday. COVID-19 testing and vaccination sites were closed in Harris County, which includes Houston; Fort Bend County, southwest of Houston; and Nueces County, which includes Corpus Christi. On Monday afternoon, Nicholas was centered roughly 70 miles (113 kilometers) southeast of Port Aransas, Texas, and 105 miles (169 kilometers) south of Port O’Connor, Texas. It was “moving erratically” just offshore, the hurricane center said. A hurricane watch was issued from Port Aransas to San Luis Pass. Eight to 16 inches (20 to 40 centimeters) of rain were expected along the middle and upper Texas coast, with isolated maximum amounts of 20 inches (50 centimeters) possible. Other parts of southeast Texas and southwest Louisiana could see 5 to 10 inches (12.5 to 25 centimeters) over the coming days. “Listen to local weather alerts and heed local advisories about the right and safe thing to do, and you’ll make it through this storm just like you’ve had many other storms,” Abbott said during a news conference in Houston. Nicholas was headed toward the same area of Texas that was hit hard by Harvey. That storm made landfall in the middle Texas coast then stalled for four days, dropping more than 60 inches (152 cm) of rain in parts of southeast Texas. Harvey was blamed for at least 68 deaths, including 36 in the Houston area. But University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy said he expects that Nicholas “will be magnitudes less than Harvey in every regard.” The worry with Nicholas will be how slowly it moves. Storms are moving slower in recent decades, and Nicholas could get stuck between two other weather systems, said hurricane researcher Jim Kossin of The Climate Service. Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards declared a state of emergency Sunday night, ahead of the storm’s arrival in a state still recovering from Hurricane Ida and last year’s Hurricane Laura and historic flooding. “The most severe threat to Louisiana is in the southwest portion of the state, where recovery from Hurricane Laura and the May flooding is ongoing,” Edwards said. The storm was expected to bring the heaviest rainfall west of where Ida slammed into Louisiana two weeks ago. Across Louisiana, almost 120,000 customers remained without power Monday morning, according to the utility tracking site poweroutage.us. While Lake Charles received minimal impact from Ida, the city saw multiple wallops from Hurricane Laura and Hurricane Delta in 2020, a winter storm in February as well as historic flooding this spring. Lake Charles Mayor Nic Hunter said the city is taking the threat of the storm seriously, as it does all tropical systems. “Hope and prayer is not a good game plan,” Hunter said. In Cameron Parish in coastal Louisiana, Scott Trahan was still finishing repairs on his home from Hurricane Laura, which put about 2 feet of water in his house. He hopes to be finished by Christmas. He said many in his area have moved instead of rebuilding. “If you get your butt whipped about four times, you are not going to get back up again. You are going to go somewhere else,” Trahan said. Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach said via Twitter that Nicholas is the 14th named storm of the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season. Only four other years since 1966 have had 14 or more named storms by Sept. 12: 2005, 2011, 2012 and 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/tropical-storm-nicholas-gets-stronger-threatens-to-hit-texas-as-hurricane/articleshow/86181097.cms||---

While the daily cases were around 1,000 a day for several days, the number of fresh cases on Sunday was 541, mainly because no tests were conducted on Sundays at the RT-PCR laboratory in the Zoram Medical College (ZMC) near Aizawl. The results of mass sample tests were not included either. The number of infected people rose to 71,381 on Monday while there were 59,060 recoveries, making the recovery rate the lowest in the northeast at 82.74% as against the national average of 97.51%. The positivity rate in the state on Monday was a whooping 31.02% against the national daily positivity rate of 2.26%. The number of active cases was 12,080 (16.92%) on Monday with the total deaths at 241 (0.34% from the number of infected people). The relentless spike in Covid-19 cases since the advent of the second wave of the pandemic in the state has left the government worried.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/mizoram-records-highest-daily-covid-cases-in-ne-for-21-days/articleshow/86181177.cms||HC Vanlalruata

The 5 crore project to build the 24-metre-long and five-metre-wide bridge was awarded in December 2020 by the Greater Chennai Corporation and is to be completed by February 2022. “The steel girders have been assembled and the work will be completed soon,” said an official. Motorists going from Anna Nagar to Nungambakkam and T Nagar face huge traffic jams at the subway entrance and at the Loyola College junction because commuters who get down at the Nungambakkam railway station usually cross the road at these points. The bus stands opposite Loyola college connects rail passengers to the rest of the city. “We just wanted to give the railway passengers an easy way to cross the road. Right now, there is no median on Nelson Manickam Road, but once the foot overbridge is constructed we will build one to stop jaywalking. The burial ground compound wall has been shifted as well,” said chief engineer, Rajendiran, in charge of roads and bridges.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/new-nungambakkam-bridge-nears-completion/articleshow/86182564.cms||---

While he has been making the journey for years, the pandemic brought with it a whole host of problems. “Even when restrictions eased, I had to walk all the way so that I could earn enough. Or ask for lifts from people passing by,” he says. But today, he doesn’t have to rely on public transport or the goodwill of strangers to get to work. The WCCG Chennai Cyclists, who got to know about his travails, gifted him a cycle under their initiative Project Annamalai. The project, launched a year ago, aims to distribute cycles to the deprived so they can commute easily within the city. “When there was no public transport during the lockdown, many people who had no other means found it difficult to commute,” says Divagaran T, founder-member of the group. The group has distributed nine cycles so far and are now looking for donors to keep the initiative going. “Though we may not notice them on the roads, many people still use cycle to get around.” “We named it after the Rajini film ‘Annamalai’, in which the humble bicycle gives him happiness even after he rose from rags to riches,” says Divagaran. In July this year, they distributed nine bicycles as part of their ninth anniversary celebrations to people who needed them, like domestic helps, who often walk from house to house. “It not only makes their commute easier but also helps them save the money they would have otherwise spent on it,” says Divagaran. Ambika Ramesh, a beneficiary who works as a domestic help in Kolathur, says the cycle helps her save time. “Earlier, I had to walk to work and back but now I cycle,” says the 38-year-old. With the support of the cycling community in Chennai, the initiative is now being scaled up. “We have a donor-beneficiary model. Donors can sponsor a new cycle or donate a used one. People can refer beneficiaries and their needs will be vetted and verified by our team of volunteers,” says Divagaran. He added that they have got more requests and will be giving 11 more bicycles soon.

---||Delhi||No stars, mega budgets or aerial feats this year too. Ramlila 2021 will be a toned-down, symbolic and digital affair: Organisers||From star appearances to aerial acts and technological feats that cost crores – over the years, Ramlilas in NCR would always be in the news for their grand celebrations and mega budgets. However, last year saw much more toned down celebrations, due to the pandemic, as Ramlila committees organised one-day pujas with very limited gatherings and digital events to mark the festival of Navratra instead. This year too, with no clarity on guidelines and the restriction on public gatherings still in place, most organisers say that Ramlilas will be a lowkey affair. While some are organising ‘symbolic events’ and taking their productions online, others have tentatively begun rehearsals with double-vaxxed cast and crew, and plans of socially distanced performances for a vaccinated audience. Here’s what to expect from this year’s celebrations: Scenes from last year’s celebrations: Ramlilas saw masks, sanitisers and social distancing in 2020 (photo for representational purposes) (photo for representational purposes) Symbolic events, digital screenings to mark Ramlila this yearWith authorities yet to issue guidelines, many organisers are planning pujas with limited attendance or put up videos of Ramlila performances from previous years, with ‘added elements’, online. “Last year, we just did a puja in an enclosed space with limited people to mark the festival, and it seems like we will be doing something similar this time. Even if the final guidelines from the authorities are issued in the next seven-10 days, that would leave us very little time to prepare for anything,” says Anil Garg, secretary, Shri Ram Dharmik Leela Committee. Prakash Barathi, secretary, Nav Shri Dharmik Lila Committee, adds, “Even after the guidelines, we will need different permissions to organise a Ramlila. It is difficult to say at present if we can organise one like we did in previous years before the pandemic.” Organisers say that it isn’t just the paucity of time that’s making them look for other “safer” ways of celebrating. They also feel that it is “almost impossible to organise a Ramlila with limited number of people.” Says Rajesh Gehlot, chief patron of Dwarka Sri Ramlila Society, “It is not possible to keep the number of people limited to 100-200 at a Ramlila. Even the number of workers backstage and artists is sometimes more than that, given the scale at which Ramlilas are organised in Delhi. Also, we have hundreds of members in our committee who would want to attend with their families. Now, how can we just ask selective people to attend? So, it is better that we go ahead with a symbolic event, like we did last year. We are also editing the videos of our Ramlila from previous years and adding new elements and scenes to it for our digital platforms.” Kamal Deep Bharti, a committee member of Indraprastha Ramlila Committee adds that “a symbolic event with a limited number of people, like last year, might be planned once we have clarity on guidelines. We are still waiting for our final meeting.” Ramlilas in 2020 saw smaller crowds and fewer performers as they adapted to the pandemic (photo for representational purposes) (photo for representational purposes) Ramlila venues will follow strict sanitisation and social distancing protocols, and only allow fully vaccinated audiences and artistes (photo for representational purposes) In some cases, the show to go on with vaccinated performers and audienceVery few like the Lav Kush Ramlila Committee have decided to go ahead and organise a Ramlila this year with COVID precautions and protocol in place. “We have plans to organise the Ramlila in its physical form this year while we await necessary permissions and guidelines. While we have decided to host the event like we used to before last year, we have to be very careful about following COVID protocols. We have decided that we will only allow entry to visitors who are fully vaccinated. Every visitor will have to produce a vaccination certificate (for both doses) at the entrance for entry,” informs Ashok Agarwal, president, Lav Kush Ramlila Committee.  He adds, “Every artist, worker and performer at the venue will also have to first submit their vaccination certificate.” Surinder Khullar from Gurgaon’s Geeta Bhawan Ramlila says, “As we await clarity from the administration, we have still begun our preparations just so that in case, any celebration is allowed, we are ready. Ramlila staging requires a lot of preparations on the backend. So, we have begun to vaccinate our members, make arrangements for sanitisation of the venue and come up with plans for maintaining social distancing and other COVID protocols. Like last year, we will have sanitisation and mask stations.” Rajkumar Saini, the spokesperson of The Shri Durga Ramleela in Jacobpura, tells us, “We have managed to fully vaccinate most of their artistes and begun rehearsals. The remaining artistes, who receive their doses later this month, will join rehearsals after their second jab. This essentially means that children, who used to be a big part of the Ramlila staging playing extras, will have to miss out this year.It’s unfortunate but they can still come and attend the staging, while wearing a mask and maintaining social distancing of course,” adds Saini. — With inputs from Abhimanyu Mathur||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-stars-mega-budgets-or-aerial-feats-this-year-too-ramlila-2021-will-be-a-toned-down-symbolic-and-digital-affair-organisers/articleshow/86166729.cms||Divya Kaushik

The call for US Special Representative Zalmay Khalilzad's dismissal comes amid questions over his negotiations with the Taliban that failed to advance the peace process outlined in the February 2020 US troop pullout deal he signed with them. "I have lost faith in Ambassador Khalilzad," Charlene Cakora, Frerichs' sister and the family spokesperson, said in a statement to Reuters, charging that he "appears to have ignored my brother's kidnapping." "They need someone talking to the Taliban who will make Mark a priority," she continued. "Ambassador Khalilzad needs to be fired." The State Department and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A senior US official last month told that the United States repeatedly has pressed the Taliban to free Frerichs. The 59-year-old US Navy veteran from Lombard, Illinois, worked in Afghanistan for a decade on development projects. He was abducted the month before Khalilzad signed the US troop pullout deal and was transferred to the Haqqani network, a brutal Taliban faction accused of some of the deadliest attacks of the war. The network's leader, Sirajuddin Haqqani, who has a $10 million FBI bounty on his head, was named interior minister last week in the Taliban government announced after their lightning takeover of Afghanistan as the last American soldiers left. Cakora alleged that Khalilzad failed to make her brother's release a priority and "never even asked the Taliban about Mark in the month" between his abduction and the U.S. troop pullout deal signing. Khalilzad, she said, "hasn't even spoken to our family since Biden took office." Taliban officials have suggested they would free Frerichs in return for the release of Bashir Noorzai, an Afghan drug lord and Taliban associate serving a life sentence in the United States for smuggling $50 million of heroin into the country. The family appealed last month for proof that Frerichs is alive in an open letter to Sirajuddin Haqqani, asking that he publish a recent video of the captive. In the letter, Cakora also urged Haqqani to offer to trade Frerichs for Noorzai. "My nation and the Taliban have been at war for a long time," she said. "I know that when wars end, prisoners on both sides should have the ability to come home."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/family-of-us-hostage-held-by-taliban-calls-for-envoys-firing/articleshow/86182680.cms||---

Thousands of mourners thronged the 27-year-old cop’s funeral in Vilgam in north Kashmir’s Kupwara district late Sunday to pay their last respects. The grenades were found in a sandbag near a divider on the highway, CRPF spokesperson Abhiram confirmed, adding that the alertness of the paramilitary personnel helped avert a major tragedy on the busy highway. Owing to heavy traffic movement on the NH, the grenades were handed over to the police for disposal instead of being defused on the spot. Meanwhile, on Monday evening, a Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorist, identified as Ishfaq Ahmad Dar of Kothipora in Budgam district, was arrested with a grenade and other ammunition by a joint team of security forces manning a checkpoint at Pachhaar area in south Kashmir’s Pulwama district. Late Sunday, thousands of people attended the funeral of sub-inspector Arshid Ashraf Mir after his body reached Vilgam’s Kalmoona village around 8pm. Mourners couldn’t hold back tears as the slain SI went on his final journey, witnesses said. Clips of the funeral were circulated on social media as well. SI Mir had gone out of the Khanyar police station, where he was posted, unarmed to purchase some goods from a grocery store on Sunday afternoon when terrorists fired at him. He was rushed to a hospital where he succumbed later. Mir, who had been inducted into the police force two years ago, is survived by his parents, wife and three children. His father, Mohammad Ashraf Mir, said he was “proud” of his son. “I demand that the killers be brought to justice at the earliest,” Mohd Ashraf added. A postgraduate in Botany, Mir had also been an outstanding student throughout, said sources.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/6-chinese-grenades-recovered-on-jk-nh-major-tragedy-averted/articleshow/86181990.cms||M Saleem Pandit

CMRL has floated a tender to install new signage across all 40 stations of phase-1 and phase-1 extension as well as neighbourhoods around these stations. The tender will help assign a firm that will design, supply and install new signage and maintain the existing ones in all metro stations. According to officials, the new signage will include illuminated, non-illuminated, photo-luminescent and retro-reflective signage which will be installed on all the levels of the station as well as outside the station. Signage will also be installed in adjacent roads and streets, nearby crowded areas like markets, government buildings, theatres, commercial and office buildings, religious buildings, adjacent railway stations, subways, foot overbridge and bus stands besides viaducts and tunnels. The new signage will be installed in coordination with the corporation, railways, MTC, highways, traffic police and airport authority of India. Except for the elevated viaducts that indicate a first time commuter that there is a metro station closeby, metro rail networks lack signage that can direct pedestrians and new passengers from neighbourhoods or major landmarks in the city to the nearest station. Though most of the bus stops are located in front of the metro stations, they do not have signage or information boards that direct passengers to the nearest entry point of the station or the time for the arrival of the next train. Commuters said it is difficult to spot underground stations or their access points. Major crowd pulling stations like Central Metro, which has five access points lack enough signage around the station and inside central railway station to guide first-time passengers to the metro. Last year, signboards on 100 Feet Road were installed on a trial basis. “Signage will not just help pedestrians walk to the nearest station but also those who use their own vehicle to reach a station,” said S Arun, a regular commuter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/soon-illuminating-signage-will-direct-people-to-metro-stations/articleshow/86183433.cms||---

The eateries were issued notices and slapped with a fine of Rs5000 each for storing stale meat, which may have found its way into biryanis and curries, officials said. “Stale meat coated with food colours and cooked in spices in some restaurants can cause serious health hazards including death,” said designated food safety officer (Chennai) Dr Satheesh Kumar P. On Friday, A 10-year-old girl died after consuming chicken dishes at an eatery in Arni in Tiruvannamalai district on Friday and more than 20 others, including three of her family members, were admitted to Government General Hospital. Poor storage of meat and fish at point of sale and in hotel kitchens are among the primary reasons affecting quality of ingredients at hotels, officials said. Last week food safety officials destroyed more than 270kg of stale fish from godowns in fish markets such as Chintadripet, Kasimedu and Nochikuppam. When hotels buy meat from such places at a low cost, the quality will be poor. “Also, in several eateries, meat is not stored at right temperatures in deep freezers and chilling trays, or it’s stored for days beyond its life. Instead of throwing them away, some hotels use them to cut corners,” Dr Satheesh said. During inspection, officials looked for the quality of other ingredients including vegetables and cooking oil, besides hygiene of kitchen, hotel rooms and staff. “While we crack down on hotels, we want to tell people to ensure they check the quality of food. They should say no to food that has added colours,” he said. Complaints can be registered through WhatsApp on 9444042322.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/food-safety-officials-fine-3-eateries-for-30kg-of-stale-chicken/articleshow/86183483.cms||---

Solicitor general Tushar Mehta explained the Centre’s predicament in filing an affidavit and, consequently, putting in the public domain, details of software used by the government agencies to intercept communications between "enemies of India" and terror organisations with their sleeper cells. This was the ground taken in its short affidavit filed by the Centre on August 17, the day the SC had issued notice to the Centre seeking a detailed reply. The SG had again sought time on September 7 to allow the Centre to decide whether or not to file such an affidavit. When he kept harping on the efficacy of the government setting up a technical committee comprising of domain experts, who have no links of any kind with the government, to examine the issue, a bench of Chief Justice N V Ramana and Justices Surya Kant and Hima Kohli said, "We thought the government will file some affidavit and depending on that we will decide how to go further. Now, they have made a statement. We will consider what interim order or some order we have to pass." The CJI-led bench said, "After all it is your prerogative (whether to file a detailed affidavit or not). We thought that if an affidavit is filed, we can take a call and decide what type of inquiry we can order. Now, we have to take into account the whole issue and do something." Read AlsoOnly want to know if Pegasus used and lawfully: SC after Centre no to detailed affidavit on snooping rowNEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday said it only wants to know from the Centre whether Pegasus was used to allegedly spy on individuals and if it was done lawfully after the latter expressed its unwillingness to file a detailed affidavit citing national security on pleas seeking an independentAs the SG reiterated the government’s stand and said, "The government’s position on the issue is clear." CJI Ramana said, "Mr Mehta, beating around the bush is not the issue." The SG countered it by saying, "Suppose the government says it never used Pegasus, are they (the dozen PIL petitioners) going to withdraw their petitions? The answer is no. Someone has to go into it. That’s why I am saying someone (technical committee set up by the government) has to go into it under SC supervision." The bench reserved its decision on the nature of the interim order it would pass, but kept the window open for the government to key in an affidavit at the eleventh hour. "We will pass some orders. It will take us two or three days to prepare the interim order. If you have any rethinking, you can inform us," the bench told Mehta. Appearing for the petitioners, senior advocate Kapil Sibal said the court should not tolerate the audacity of the government to refuse divulging information about the use of Pegasus to snoop on citizens in brazen violation of their right to privacy, ruled by the court to be part of right to life. Read Also'Not a matter for public domain': Won't file detailed affidavit on Pegasus, Centre tells SCThe Centre has informed the Supreme Court that it is not going to file a detailed affidavit on petitions seeking inquiry into alleged use of spyware Pegasus. The government had asked for time to decide on filing the affidavit twice. SG Tushar Mehta said that whether a particular software was used or"The Centre appears to have used Pegasus. That is why it has not taken any action against Israeli manufacturer NSO or any of the agencies that have used it. Neither has it registered any FIR to inquire into it despite admitting awareness about use of Pegasus while answering a question in Parliament," Sibal said and requested the court that if at all a technical expert committee was set up, then it should be constituted by the court and not by the government. Sibal’s arguments were supplemented by a host of senior advocates — Shyam Divan, Dinesh Dwivedi, Rakesh Dwivedi, Meenakshi Arora and Colin Gonsalves. Most of them said that the committee must comprise experts chosen by the SC and not the government. The SG said while it is the wont of petitioners, the government is handicapped from sensationalising the issues involved. "There would be a marginal line of distinction between protecting the privacy of the citizens, which is the priority of the government, and entering into a zone that could compromise national security. There is a statutory regime in place and interception per se is not illegal. A petitioner cites two experts to say this (Pegasus) is a very dangerous technology. It is a dangerous technology. All technologies have their own ill-effects. They can be used and abused." "Let all these technical issues be gone into by domain experts to find out whether the petitioners are right or wrong. Let the petitioners submit their phones for examination by the committee to find out whether these were snooped using the spyware. There is no question of doubting the credibility of the government-appointed committee. It is an assurance by me to the court that the domain experts will have no relationship with the government, directly or indirectly or any employment link with the government. Their report will ultimately come before the Supreme Court. We have nothing to hide. But a facade is created that the government is not telling the truth to the court, the government is hiding something," he said. "There are sensitive issues involved where certain things are not placed on record by way of an affidavit. But, respecting the privacy of the citizens, the government on its own is offering to let the issues be gone into and reports be placed before the SC. The committee will be answerable to the court. We cannot afford to have a committee which cannot withstand the SC’s judicial scrutiny. This is the response to doubts expressed about the credibility of the committee," Mehta said.. "(Petitioner’s) insistence that it must be put in the public domain would cause irreparable harm to national security. If the government says it is not using a particular software. It will alert potential terror groups. If the government says it is using it, there will be different consequences. Every technology has its counter technology to protect their system from getting examined by security agencies. Instead of the petitioner’s insistence on an affidavit to put everything in public domain, I am requesting for a technical committee," the SG said. Peppered by the repeated assertions from the government about its clear intentions, the CJI said, "You are repeatedly saying you do not want to put anything (relating to national security) in the public domain. We are also not interested in it. We have made it very clear. Petitioners are also not interested in knowing anything concerning national security and interests of the country. Even if they insist, we are not going to entertain such requests. The question is, even assuming for a minute, an expert committee is appointed, which examines the issues and submits a report to the court. When they place the report before the court, that day it will come in the public domain." The SG said, the SC will decide whether the report should be put in public domain or not. "Certainly it can come into the public domain, if the SC so decides," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/supreme-court-reserves-order-on-mode-of-inquiry-into-pegasus-controversy/articleshow/86183425.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu board text books covered 82% NEET questions||CHENNAI: Topics in Tamil Nadu state board text books, which were upgraded recently, only covered 82% of the questions asked in Sunday’s National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET), an analysis has revealed. In contrast, in the previous year, 97% of the questions in NEET were covered by the text books. This year, of the 200 questions, 37 were out of syllabus, said teachers and experts, adding that some of the questions framed were from topics not covered even by NCERT. Of the 50 questions in the zoology section, five were out of syllabus, while in botany, 34 questions were within the syllabus. “Of the 100 questions, 66 questions were in the easy-to-moderate level, 34 were difficult. Students would have found the biology section easier if they prepared well,” an expert said. In physics, of the 50 questions only two were out of syllabus and 18 were rated difficult by teachers. “Physics needed face-to-face teaching. Due to syllabus cuts and online coaching, many students have struggled to understand the concepts,” said Rita John, head, department of theoretical physics at Madras University and domain expert for physics. The current batch students got the upgraded textbooks only in Class XI, she said. “The government should introduce concept-based questions in board exams and annual exams to improve their performances in competitive exams. Some of the questions rated as difficult were just worded differently,” she said. In chemistry, 12 questions were not covered by the textbooks. However, 41 questions in this section were rated as being easy to moderate. Gayathiri S, a biology teacher from the city said though the biology section looks easier, it had a few tricky questions. "The questions have to be re-read by focusing on keywords. The key to better performance is avoiding the questions which students were not familiar with," she said, adding some questions in the biology section were not even from NCERT textbooks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tn-texts-covered-82-neet-questions/articleshow/86183764.cms||---
---||Chennai||Madras HC asks Centre to give more funds for mental health care||Observing that 47 government-run mental health hospitals are not sufficient for a country like India with a population of nearly 136 crore, the Madras high court asked the Centre to establish more central mental health institutions like Nimhans at least in every zone at the earliest. It should also allocate more funds for mental health care as more people are suffering from mental illness. A division bench of Justice N Kirubakaran (who has since retired after signing the order) and Justice B Pugalendhi observed that World Health Organization calls India the most depressed country in the world. Hence, it is the duty of the Centre along with all state governments to have a comprehensive action plan to identify patients with mental illness and provide appropriate treatment. A periodical survey should be conducted for this purpose. Since there is an acute shortage of psychiatrists and child psychiatrists in the country, the judges said all medical colleges should have a department of psychiatry with a postgraduate course in it. “The concept of having only mental hospitals to provide psychiatric care is an outdated one. Now, it is believed that a majority of persons with mental illnesses can be managed in the community or through outpatient care,” the judges said while calling for efforts to have a psychiatrist in all taluk headquarters hospitals. The judges observed that Karnataka has devised digital monitoring mechanisms to oversee district mental health programme and implementation of Mental Healthcare Act, 2017. The Karnataka Mental Health Management System has been developed with provisions for registering mental health establishments, mental health professionals and facilitating the functioning of state mental health authority and mental health review boards. The Centre and other state governments have to follow this system. The judges also said taboo/social stigma attached to those with mental illness prevents people from taking proper treatment. The stigma attached to mental illness should be dispelled through awareness plans. Though there is a provision under the Act for insurance coverage for mental illness, it is not known to the general public. Hence, governments should sensitize people about this. The court passed the order while disposing of a PIL filed by K R Raja of Madurai who sought a direction to establish an exclusive medical wing in the central prison either in Trichy or Madurai to provide mental health care to prisoners with adequate staff.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/hc-asks-centre-to-give-more-funds-for-mental-health-care/articleshow/86183771.cms||Kaushik Kannan

Defence minister Rajnath Singh will host the second India-Africa Defence Dialogue (IADD) on the sidelines of the DefExpo scheduled at Gandhinagar in Gujarat in March next year, said an official on Monday. The first-ever IADD was held at Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh in conjunction with DefExpo in February last year, which was co-organized by the defence and external affairs ministries. Read AlsoRajnath holds talks with Australian defence ministerNEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Friday held wide-ranging talks with his Australian counterpart Peter Dutton to boost overall bilateral strategic ties. The talks took place a day ahead of the inaugural 'two-plus-two' dialogue between foreign and defence ministers of India and Australia.“India proposes to institutionalise the IADD during DefExpos, which are held once every two years. It will help build on the existing partnerships with African countries. The IADD will explore new areas of convergence for mutual engagements including areas like capacity building, training, cyber security, maritime security and counter terrorism,” the official said. The Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses shall be the knowledge partner of IADD and will assist in providing necessary support for enhanced defence cooperation between India and Africa. “India and Africa share a close and historical relationship. The foundation of the India–Africa defence relations are based on the two guiding principles namely ‘SAGAR’ (security and growth for all in the region) and ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’ (the world is one family),” he said. In line with the overall policy to step up the military outreach to Africa, the Army had also conducted the first Africa-India military field training exercise, which included 18 countries from the continent, at the Aundh military station at Pune in March 2019. Apart from visits by defence minister Rajnath Singh and chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat to Africa, India has also been holding defence cooperation talks with countries like Botswana, Egypt, Kenya, Lesotho, Morocco, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/eye-on-china-india-set-to-cement-africa-defence-ties/articleshow/86183430.cms||---

Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) Villupuram, one of the eight state transport undertakings, is entrusted with the task of operating town buses on the city's outskirts, particularly areas outside the Chennai metropolitan area. As per norms, these buses are supposed to collect 5 as the base fare and one rupee extra for every stage henceforth. In Tamil Nadu, bus fare is calculated based on the number of stages travelled by a passenger. Minimum distance between two stages or major bus stops en route should be 2km for town bus services. But TNSTC Villupuram has set up a stage for every 1km. For instance, a town bus, which is operated along route T7, connects Tiruttani with Chivada in the neighbouring Thiruvallur. This is an ordinary bus service, in which the minimum fare is 5. The distance between two subsequent stages in this route is less than a kilometre. K Senthil Kumar, a resident-activist from Iyyapanthangal, who recently boarded this bus at Tiruttani bus stand was shocked when 10 was collected as fare from him for travelling for a short distance. He got down at the third bus stop (named Tiruttani Bypass), which is located between the first and third stage. Ideally, the conductor should have collected only 6 from him (5 base fare and one rupee for extra stage). But the conductor charged 10 from him and other passengers in the bus. "There are two violations. First, the distance between two stages is less than the government-prescribed 2km. Next, conductors don't issue 6 to 9 tickets. After the 5 tickets, directly 10 tickets are sold. Basically, they are trying to boost the daily ticket revenue illegally," said Senthil. Despite repeated attempts, TNSTC Villupuram officials refused to comment on the violation. To avoid such issues, the state transport department had directed all STUs to upload bus fare details in the government website and display them prominently inside buses. Even nine years later, it remains on paper.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/govt-town-buses-collect-excess-fare-officials-keep-mum/articleshow/86183849.cms||Ram Sundaram

Poor planning and coordination, delay in tender approval and issues in contract management caused abnormal delays in completion of projects, the report said. The report said an estimated 242.73 million litres of raw sewage illegally entered storm water drains daily and drained into water bodies including rivers Adyar and Cooum and the Buckingham Canal. Projects sanctioned to address this issue had limited success. As of March 31, 2019, only 52% of the sewage generated in CMA was collected by the existing sewerage system. And, only 88% of the collected sewage was treated before being let out. The report said the achievement in recycling and reusing treated water was only 6.5% of the sewage generated against the prescribed benchmark of 20%. Five sewage treatment plants (STPs) without biogas power generation plant and three others with non-functional plants released an estimated 5.7 million cubic metres of environmentally dangerous methane gas per annum. Further, failure to review the contracted maximum demand requirement by six hospitals and Anna Centenary Library resulted in an avoidable payment of electricity charges of Rs7.07 crore during 2016-19. Lack of commitment by the government and casual handling of expensive high tech systems of the Anna Centenary Library by the Director of Public Libraries had resulted in Rs 7.98 crore assets created remaining unfruitful, the report said. Failures by the directorates of school and elementary education to check claims made by Textbook Corporation and failures to detect errors in textbooks resulted in avoidable expenditure of Rs23.27 crore. Improper planning and failure to assess the actual building requirements by Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital and director of medical education led to idling of three structurally completed multi-storeyed buildings constructed at a cost of Rs 55.33 crore, the report said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/cag-faults-sewage-disposal-in-chennai-metropolitan-area/articleshow/86183877.cms||---
---||India||CBI, ED, Bengal speaker head for showdown||KOLKATA: The CBI on Monday questioned Bengal industries minister Partha Chatterjee for two hours in the iCore case, the development setting off a chain of events that saw central agencies re-emerging as flashpoints in the rocky West Bengal government-Centre relationship. Three separate developments followed in quick succession as the CBI team left Chatterjee’s office around 2pm. One, assembly speaker Biman Banerjee shot off summons to two senior ED and CBI officers, asking them to appear before him on September 22 to explain why they had filed Narada chargesheets against three MLAs (ministers Subrata Mukherjee and Firhad Hakim, and Madan Mitra) without informing him. Two, the Centre asked the NIA to probe the crude bomb blasts at BJP MP Arjun Singh’s home on September 8. And, three, the ED summoned state law minister Moloy Ghatak in the illegal coal-mining scam. Monday’s developments came in the wake of the ED questioning TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee for nine hours last Monday and sending him a fresh summons to appear for questioning next week. Three assembly constituencies, including Bhowanipore (where CM Mamata Banerjee is a candidate), are going for by-polls on September 30. Three CBI officers reached Chatterjee’s office Shilpa Sadan’s sixth floor around noon on Monday after he Chatterjee told the agency he was available for questioning. at his office.CBI officers, who arrived at the industry minister’s office around noon, wanted to know the reason behind the his presence at a 2011 programme, where he reportedly “endorsed” the iCore group. “I was given charge of the industries and IT departments in the first three months of 2011. There were many companies that wanted to set up units here. They used to come to the department. How would I know if iCore was a Ponzi firm or not? That is the Sebi and the RBI’s job,” Chatterjee explained later. The Speaker’s summons, which reached the ED and CBI offices in the afternoon, pointed out that Section 19 of the Prevention of Corruption Act (1988) mandated that the Speaker’s permission must be sought to file chargesheets against sitting legislators. It asked CBI deputy SP Satyendra Singh and ED assistant director Rathin Biswas to explain their action, which, the letter said, had “denigrated” the state legislature. A Union home ministry letter asking the NIA to probe the bombing at BJP MP Singh’s Bhatpara home reached the state government. State cops have already arrested two persons, including a minor, based on CCTV footage and lodged attempt-to-murder and explosives cases. Singh and opposition leader Suvendu Adhikari have called the blast an attempt on Singh’s life and demanded a central agency probe. The ED summons to the state law minister rounded off the day’s developments; it called him for questioning at its Delhi office on September 14. Ghatak, however, said, “Even a child now understands that this is totally politically motivated.” (With inputs from Sanjib Chakraborty and Debasish Konar)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cbi-ed-bengal-speaker-head-for-showdown/articleshow/86183950.cms||Rohit Khanna

The trip is aimed at highlighting his push to combat global warming and strengthen infrastructure, while helping fellow Democrat Gavin Newsom try to hold on to California's governorship. Biden visited the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, a hub designed to coordinate resources on wildfires - and held a briefing with state and local officials before flying to Sacramento, California, to see wildfire damage in the area. The president said fire season in the United States is starting earlier each year and that this year alone, 44,000 wildfires in the country had consumed 5.4 million acres (2.2 million hectares) - an area roughly the size of New Jersey. "Thank God, thank God we have you," Biden told firefighters in the room." He pledged to help federal firefighters make at least $15 an hour and said he is committed to raising the pay gap for firefighters who protect federal wildlands. "The reality is we have a global warming problem, a serious global warming problem," Biden said, pegging the economic damage from extreme weather events last year at $99 billion. Last week, he called climate change an existential threat during a trip to New Jersey and New York. White House principal deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Monday that one in three Americans is affected by the increasing frequency of extreme weather events and that Biden's message on his first trip to the U.S. West Coast as president would be that the "climate crisis is in code red."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-promotes-climate-goals-in-idaho-on-first-stop-of-western-us-trip/articleshow/86184375.cms||---

A bench of Justice M R Shah and A S Bopanna expressed its satisfaction over guidelines framed by the Centre for issuing Covid death certificates and payment of compensation but said three to four issues needed to be sorted out, including bringing those who committed suicide while being Covid positive under its ambit. “You say that suicide cases would not be covered. We are prima facie of the view that it cannot be accepted. What about persons who committed suicide because of suffering of Covid. Reconsider your decision,” the bench told the solicitor general after going through Centre’s guidelines. Mehta agreed and assured the court that the government would re-examine the issue. “Cause of death may be suicide but the cause of suicide is Covid and the issue needs to be revisited,” he submitted. In an affidavit filed before the SC, the Centre had also submitted that the Office of the Registrar General of India on September 3 had issued a circular to provide a medical certificate of cause of death to the next of kin of the deceased.

---||India||Tamil Nadu raises quota for women in govt jobs from 30% to 40%||CHENNAI: The Tamil Nadu government has increased the quota for women in government jobs from 30% to 40%. Making the announcement in the state assembly on Monday, state finance and human resource management minister Palanivel Thiaga Rajan said gender equality would play a major role in ushering in change and the government would introduce necessary amendments to implement the increase in job quota for women. According to the 2017-18 data provided by the department of employment and training, out of 8.8 lakh employees of the state government, state government undertakings and local bodies, 2.92 lakh were women. The percentage of women among government employees is 33%. “The present trend is that women are doing much better in terms of numbers in government service. The quota system does not mean that it will directly translate into numbers,” a senior bureaucrat said on condition of anonymity. The officer pointed to the number of women competing in the general category as well to get into service on merit. From angawandi staff to workers at noon meal centres, teachers, assistants, section officers, chief engineers and additional secretaries, women hold various posts in government offices. Times ViewThis is a positive step towards attaining gender parity. But the government must also be clear that job reservation is not a quick fix to attain social justice and gender equality. Obtaining real social equality is a more complex and difficult task. The state must ensure that women from disadvantaged social and economic segments are enabled through education and skilling to gain their due share of the benefits of such affirmative action.Replying to the debate on demand for grants for the human resource management department, the minister said preference would be given to orphans, who had lost their parents to Covid-19, first generation graduates and Tamil-medium students in government schools while filling up vacancies in government posts. “Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the age limit for recruitment exams will be relaxed by two years as the exams were delayed,” Palanivel Thiaga Rajan said. The Tamil language paper would be made mandatory in exams conducted by recruitment agencies for all state government departments and undertakings to ensure 100% Tamil Nadu candidates are appointed to the vacancies. The HR department would get software and experts for the directorate of vigilance and anti-corruption (DVAC) at a cost of Rs 1.1 crore to analyse online banking transactions. The state government would establish DVAC units in newly established districts, including Chengalpet, Kallakurichi, Mayiladuthurai, Ranipet, Tenkasi and Triupattur, at a cost of Rs 2.9 crore. The state government plans to impart training to all government school teachers from primary schools to higher secondary schools at Anna Institute of Management. Along with the teachers, child protection officers, anganwadi workers, noon meal workers and welfare hostel wardens would be provided special training at a cost of Rs 2 crore. The government would conduct refresher training in time management for government employees who have crossed 53 years, as well as training in leadership qualities and maintaining good public relations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/tamil-nadu-raises-quota-for-women-in-govt-jobs-from-30-to-40/articleshow/86184708.cms||---

The details of the cash transactions were revealed from documents and digital evidence seized during raids on Sukhpal Singh Khaira, a former Punjab AAP MLA and an accused in the money laundering cases related to fake passports and international drug trafficking. According to sources, Khaira in his statement has told the ED investigating officer that $119,000 was collected by AAP functionaries during an event in the US and were in cash receipts for which only the party can provide further information if these have been accounted for in their books. When documents seized at Khaira’s premises revealed huge cash receipts in the US, he was confronted with the details. He, however, said the collections were contributions to the party fund and he had no other details as to how they were collected and who the donors were. On March 9 this year, ED officials conducted searches across Punjab and Delhi, which included premises of Sukhpal Singh Khaira and his son-in-law. The money trail being investigated by the ED revealed Khaira’s links with one of the kingpins of a syndicate, based in the UK, operating India-Pak network with the help of some politicians from Punjab. Khaira has been repeatedly questioned with regards to his links with members of the drug cartel accused in the Fazilka drug smuggling case. After the searches, ED officials had claimed that the seized “incriminating documents and digital devices revealed involvement of some high profile people with the drug and human trafficking syndicate”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ed-summons-aaps-pankaj-gupta-over-cash-collections-at-us-event/articleshow/86184577.cms||Pradeep Thakur
---||World||Pentagon backs efforts by US veterans to evacuate Afghans||WASHINGTON: The Defense Department supports the ongoing efforts of US military veterans to help evacuate at risk Afghans from the country, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Monday. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin "shares the same concerns that so many of these veterans groups and individual veterans have for our Afghan allies that are still there and still want to leave the country," Kirby told reporters. "You've heard him say many times that we believe we have a sacred obligation to those who helped us over the last 20 years," the spokesman said. "Nothing's changed about that so he shares their concerns and he welcomes their input." A number of former members of the US military who were stationed in Afghanistan have remained in touch with the Afghan troops they served alongside with or with their Afghan interpreters, and have expressed concerns about their fate now that the Taliban have retaken power. Some US military veterans launched private initiatives to help their former Afghan colleagues flee the country, sneaking them into Kabul airport for evacuation flights. A group called the "Pineapple Express" claimed to have helped with the evacuation of 630 Afghans and is reportedly continuing its efforts to get people out of the country. Kirby said there is no active US military role in these efforts. "It doesn't involve an active military component," he said, "just the Defense Department helping facilitators, organizers make connections." The Pentagon spokesman also said that flights of Afghans to the United States from third countries for resettlement would be paused for at least a week after several cases of measles were diagnosed among the evacuees. "There have been five diagnosed cases of measles among new arrivals so far," Kirby said. The United States and its allies flew more than 120,000 people out of Afghanistan in one of the largest airlifts in history.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/pentagon-backs-efforts-by-us-veterans-to-evacuate-afghans/articleshow/86184899.cms||---

Opposition leader Siddaramaiah and KPCC chief DK Shivakumar set out on bullock carts from their respective residences in Kumara Park and Sadashivanagar leading two teams of legislators. Congress functionaries and supporters followed them in a procession till Vidhana Soudha. The procession that saw five bullock carts leaving from Shivakumar’s house and five from Siddaramaiah’s affected vehicular movement on Ballari Road. Health minister K Sudhakar, cooperation minister ST Somashekar and BJP MLA MP Renukacharya were among those who were stranded and arrived late at the assembly hall, while the house congregated at 11am. “It would have been meaningful had the Congress launched such a protest during the UPA regime when the prices were high. Let them raise this issue in the house. I will reply,” said chief minister Basavaraj Bommai. Traffic on Ballari Road — between Windsor Manor junction and Hebbal flyover — came to a standstill for over 30 minutes and moved slowly for the next half an hour. Passengers heading to Kempegowda International Airport were hit. So were many officegoers as Chalukya Circle, KR Circle, Hudson Circle, Mehkri Circle, Hebbal flyover and Anand Rao Circle witnessed bumper-to-bumper traffic. Siddaramaiah, however, defended the move saying it is the duty of the opposition to voice the concerns of people. “Even a tall leader like Atal Bihari Vajpayee had taken out a bullock-cart rally in 1973 to protest price rise. The government has steeply hiked tax on fuel and must bring it down. We will move an adjournment motion in the house on Tuesday,” he said. He said the government is lying about crude oil price as it’s citing that as the reason for the fuel price hike. Siddaramaiah asked BJP leaders to compare the prices when Manmohan Singh was the prime minister with the present rates, saying excise duty on diesel was Rs 3.45 per litre during the UPA regime and is Rs 31.74 at present. He said duty on petrol was Rs 9.21and is Rs 32.98 now. Calling the government a pickpocket, Shivakumar demanded the prices of LPG, petrol and diesel be brought down at least by Rs 150, Rs 35 and Rs 25, respectively. Police stopped Congress leaders at the west gate of Vidhana Soudha and let them in with one bullock cart after heated arguments. The chaos even saw some Congress legislators, including Ajay Singh, fall from the bullock cart. Ryots protest farm lawsAbout 5,000 farmers staged a sit-in on Sheshadri Road when they were stopped by police from taking out a march to Vidhana Soudha to protest farm laws. Under the aegis of Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha and Hasiru Sene, they launched the march from KSR Bengaluru City railway station. They were stopped near Maharani’s College. The road was blocked till 2.30pm, disrupting traffic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/congs-bullock-cart-protest-against-fuel-rates-hits-traffic/articleshow/86180895.cms||---
---||Mangaluru||From civic body to Centre, Oscar Fernandes was a popular leader||MANGALURU: Former Union minister and Rajya Sabha member Oscar Fernandes died at a private hospital here on Monday. He was 80. Born in 1941, Oscar’s political innings began after he became member of the municipal council in Udupi in 1972. In 1980, the arts graduate was elected MP from Udupi Lok Sabha constituency and his victory march continued in 1984, 1989, 1991 and 1996. Later, for three successive terms, he was Rajya Sabha member and was currently into his fourth term. A twice KPCC president, Oscar was also the joint secretary of AICC and became a Union minister for road transport and highways; and labour and employment in the UPA government. He was close to Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. This was evident from the fact that soon after his death, Congress president Sonia Gandhi spoke to his wife Blossom. “Don’t cry too much. You have so many beautiful memories of him. We all loved him. Everyone loved him. I don’t think there was anyone who had different feelings for him than love and respect. Now you are strong, I will speak to you after a few days,” Sonia reportedly told her. Blossom and Oscar were inseparable. She would always stand by him in almost all his public functions across the nation. Funeral in B’luru on ThursdayHe had an accidental fall while doing his regular exercise and was admitted to Yenepoya Hospital here on July 19.

The court then directed the NHRC to report the steps taken to find a logical conclusion to the issue based on the report of its investigation division. As to the probe being conducted by the CBI, the bench said: “The matter should be brought to its logical end, as expeditiously as possible, to give a meaningful closure to the matter and the circumstances in which firing had to be resorted to against unarmed citizens must come out in the report.” The state is requested to play the real parental role in providing counselling and psychiatric assistance to the members of the bereaved families, if necessary, the court added. “The state must be seen to be with the families and not an adversary, despite whatever may have happened. The state needs to walk the extra mile for such purpose…” the judges said. The court then adjourned the hearing to October 25 for the commission to file its report. The directions were passed on a PIL moved by rights activist Henri Tiphagne seeking direction to the NHRC to reopen the probe and to furnish a report of the investigation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/citizens-should-not-be-fired-on-at-behest-of-corporate-houses-hc/articleshow/86183835.cms||---
---||Chennai||NEET abolition: Tamil Nadu govt can demand, Centre can reject||CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu’s renewed battle to scrap NEET is neither impossible nor easy, for it is as much political as constitutional. Political, because it would need the Union government’s consent and presidential assent. Constitutional, because education, after the 42nd amendment, is on the concurrent list where the Centre and the states have equal power to enact laws. “As long as education is on the concurrent list, the state government can enact a law,” said Justice D Hariparanthaman, who retired as a Madras high court judge. He, however, added that the law will not come into force till the Centre gives its nod. In 2017, the AIADMK government made a similar attempt, but it did not pursue it. The President rejected it. There are several state-specific laws concerning concurrent list subjects that Tamil Nadu enacted and got the presidential assent. For example, in 2006 Tamil Nadu did away with the entrance examination for professional courses. Tamil Nadu Admission in Professional Educational Institutions Act, 2006, received presidential assent in March 2007, and in March 2011, the Supreme Court upheld the state law. Similarly, it was a Tamil Nadu-specific amendment to the Hindu Marriages Act which enabled a Hindu in the state to marry without following the rituals. Section 7(A) was inserted in the act by the C N Annadurai government. No other state has this provision. In 1977, the MGR government inserted Section 2(A)(2) in the Industrial Disputes Act, enabling an individual workman to raise a dispute without the government’s reference. Though the subject is jointly occupied by the Union and state governments, and when even Left bastions like Bengal and Kerala did not have such a law, the Centre gave its assent for the Tamil Nadu-specific amendment. Jallikattu is the most recent Tamil Nadu law which got the presidential assent though it differed from the Centre’s stand. In January 2017, by amending the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act (a subject on the concurrent list), Tamil Nadu ensured that jallikattu was exempted from the list of banned performances by animals. In 1994, the Jayalalithaa government did a Houdini act when Tamil Nadu, with just 39 MPs, mustered a two-thirds majority in the 534-member parliament to include its 69% reservation law in the Ninth Schedule, thereby insulating the state law from judicial review. “Just as now, even then the issue was as political as constitutional. It was a quid pro quo by the Jayalalithaa government for its support to the PV Narasimha Rao government to pass the Panchayati Raj Act in Parliament,” said Justice Hariparanthaman. The possibility of the law being rejected by the Union government does not mean Tamil Nadu should not demand its right guaranteed by the Constitution. “It is a limited constitutional power, but if Tamil Nadu does not enact a law as per its stated policy, it will amount to giving up its right,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/neet-abolition-state-can-demand-centre-can-reject/articleshow/86181020.cms||A Subramani

The woman, who complained of headache and body ache after getting the double jab, has been kept under medical observation at the same facility. Cuddalore deputy director (health) R Meera confirmed it was a goof-up. “A staff nurse posted at the centre gave the vaccine to the woman. An assistant, a pharmacist, was busy lining up other people. The nurse was giving medicines to those who had got the jab. The woman, who got the vaccine, did not move out, and remained on the seat. The nurse returned and gave her another jab, thinking it was another person waiting for the shot,” said the official. Neither the nurse nor the woman, who had by now walked out of the room, realised the mistake till another person in queue told the nurse what had happened. The nurse got to the woman who was about to leave and asked her to stay back. “The patient complained of headache and body pain. Her blood pressure and oxygen saturation were normal. A district programme officer has made an inquiry and submitted a report. The woman will be under observation for the next 24 hours,” said Meera. A doctor said it is a rare incident and the effect cannot be predicted immediately. Dr N G Rajesh, a professor of pathology at Jawaharlal Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education, said he was not aware of any scientific literature on the effect of such a double dose. “There is nothing to worry, but the patient must be kept under observation,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/cuddalore-woman-given-2-doses-once-under-observation/articleshow/86183816.cms||Bosco Dominique

Two persons were killed by the same tusker on Sunday night, taking the death count to six in the district in as many days. In a chilling trend, one of the victims was on a bike. Several such incidents have occurred in the last few weeks in the state, including a particularly heart-rending one in Surguja four days ago when a herd of elephants killed a couple and their four-year-old son after kicking them around for 100 metres. They were on a scooter. Like the family, Mahasamund resident Raju Vishwakarma may have surprised the elephant. He was riding a motorcycle with two others when they were attacked by an elephant while crossing Gaurkheda village, Mahasamund DFO Pankaj Rajput said. According to the survivors, the tusker barred their way and then charged at them. The one driving the bike was so rattled that he crashed while trying to do a U-turn. The elderly Vishwakarma couldn’t get away fast enough. The elephant coiled its trunk around him, hurled him on the ground and then trampled him to death even as his companions fled in terror. About an hour later, a few kilometres away, the same elephant killed a 30-year-old farmer, Parmeswar guarding his crops. This region is less than 100km east of Raipur. On September 7, another biker was killed by an elephant in Bandora village, around 40km from the site of Sunday’s twin attacks. Forest officials are alarmed by the spurt in elephant attacks in Mahasamund. Six of the eight human deaths in the district this year have happened in the last week, making officials wonder what triggered the spike. Last week’s toll is nearly a quarter of the 26 deaths in human-elephant conflicts in Mahasamund since 2015. Nearly 50 were wounded in this period. Officials said alerts are being sounded from time to time about the presence and movement of elephants so that people stay indoors and don’t come across a herd or a loner, especially after dusk. The kin of those killed on Sunday night were given Rs 25,000 each as immediate assistance. They will be given the full compensation, said officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/raipur/tusker-kills-2-men-in-cg-village-6-dead-in-a-week/articleshow/86185506.cms||Rashmi Drolia

Following Covid-19 for the past two years, Gajapayana, the ceremonial march of elephants from the forests to Mysuru, ahead of their participation in Dasara has been held in a simple but traditional manner. The Dasara elephants - Gopalaswamy, Cauvery, Lakshmi, Dhananjaya, Chaitra, Vikrama and Ashwathama led by mighty tusker Abhimanyu, who will be carrying the Golden Howdah for the second time, were extended a traditional reception at Veeranahosahalli during Thula lagna at 9.50am. Mysuru mayor Sunanda Palanetra, MP Pratap Simha and Hunsur MLA HP Manjunath flagged off the journey of elephants from the woods by lighting lamps and showering flowers on the pachyderms. MLA Manjunath distributed new dresses to mahouts and kavadis. Around 45 members, including eight mahouts, eight kavadis, helpers and special care takers accompanied the elephants. Veterinarian Ramesh will monitor the health of the elephants during their stay in Mysuru. Later, the elephants were ferried in trucks to Mysuru. Around 2.30pm, the elephants reached Aranya Bhavan where they will stay till Wednesday (September 15). On Thursday, the elephants will be traditionally welcomed at the Mysuru Palace. The elephants will be made to get accustomed to urban environment and will also be given training and rehearse for the Dasara procession, which is scheduled on October 16. They will be trained in their Dasara duties inside the palace premises given that the Jamboree is restricted to the palace premises owing to the pandemic. DCF (Mysuru wildlife) V Karikalan said, “On September 16, the elephants will be shifted to Mysuru Palace premises. All the eight elephants are found healthy during the medical check-up conducted regularly from the past few days. The mahouts and kavadis are insured.” Karikalan said that tusker Ashwathama which was captured at Sakleshpura range in Hassan district in 2017 will be participating in Dasara for the first time. “The elephant will be trained to participate regularly in the coming Dasara festivities. While the mahouts and kavadis have been vaccinated with the first dose, those who have not got the second dose will be administered at Mysuru Palace premises,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/countdown-to-dasara-begins-as-jumbos-arrive-in-mysuru/articleshow/86176741.cms||---
---||India||Govt plans Covid vaccines for comorbid kids aged 12-17 by October-November||NEW DELHI: The government plans to begin Covid vaccination of children in the 12-17 age group who have co-morbidities like obesity, heart disorders, or immunodeficiency by October-November, official sources said. The plan keeps in mind that supplies of Zydus Cadila’s DNA vaccine ZyCoV-D — the only one to have received emergency authorisation for use in children in the country so far — are likely to begin in October. “We are waiting for Zydus to begin supplies. Once that starts we will initiate vaccination among children. This year, only those with co-morbidities will receive the vaccine doses, rest will start getting it from the first quarter of next year,” a senior official told TOI. Read AlsoNo scientific body suggests Covid vaccination of kids should be condition to reopen schools: GovtThe Union government on Thursday said no scientific body suggests that vaccination of children against Covid-19 should be a condition for reopening schools, but inoculation of teachers, school employees and parents is desirable.Around 20-30 lakh children with co-morbidities will be eligible for the first round of vaccination, according to government estimates. Zydus is expected to supply around 40 lakh doses in the first lot, and scale it up to one crore every month going forward. The government is expecting that the company will be able to supply around 4-5 crore doses by December. ZyCoV-D is a three dose vaccine. The government expects to further expand coverage among children by March next year, when more vaccines are available for them. Read AlsoIndia's getting ready to vaccinate childrenThe final evaluation The country’s top paediatricians will review international data on children vaccinated against Covid-19 and present it to the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) early next week, reports The Economic Times. “The paediatricians will presentBharat Biotech’s Covaxin is also being tested for use in children and clinical trials are nearing completion, according to regulatory officials. Once Covaxin gets emergency authorisation for use in children, it can be administered to all those above two years. There are also other vaccine candidates from Biological E and Serum Institute of India that have recently got approval for clinical trials in children. Overall, there are an estimated 44 crore children aged under 18. Of this, around 12 crore are in the age group of 12-17 years, who are likely to be first in line to receive the vaccines. However, given the limited supplies, the government has decided to further prioritise those with co-morbidities in this age group as they are vulnerable to the infection. The government is also of the view that once majority of the adult population gets at least the first dose of the anti-Covid jabs, they can start with children — who are now more in focus with re-opening of schools and other related activities that were under lockdown since March 2020 due to Covid-19 outbreak in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-plans-covid-vaccines-for-comorbid-kids-aged-12-17-by-october-november/articleshow/86184764.cms||Sushmi Dey

But the difference in cases between the north and the south is perhaps starker today than at any other period. In the week ending Sunday, Maharashtra and the five southern states, along with the UT of Puducherry, together recorded nearly 2.2 lakh fresh cases. Kerala alone accounted for more than 1.7 lakh new infections, followed by Tamil Nadu (11,161) and Andhra Pradesh (8,660). In sharp contrast, the cumulative case count in 14 states and UTs of north and central India (other than Maharashtra and Goa) during this period was just 3,687 — barely 1.6% of the number reported in Maharashtra and the south. These states/UTs include J&K, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Chandigarh, Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand. The region includes the five states that reported the lowest count of fresh cases in the country last week. Rajasthan leads that list with just 61 new infections detected last week. Read AlsoWeekly Covid-19 cases drop 13% as Kerala sees 17% dipIndia reported a 13% drop in fresh Covid-19 cases in the week ending Sunday, the first substantial decline in infections in three weeks, as Kerala registered a 17% dip in case count.The nine states in east and northeast India (including Bengal and Odisha) together accounted for nearly 21,000 new cases. Meanwhile, during last week, while Kerala reported a 16.4% decline in Covid cases, infections rose in four states and UTs among those reporting at least 500 weekly cases. These were Bengal, which posted a 6.9% spike in infections, Tamil Nadu (3%), Mizoram (12.7%) and J&K (21.7%). Tiny Mizoram recorded over 7,000 fresh cases, the 5th highest count after Kerala (1.7 lakh), Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. This was the third straight week of rising cases in Mizoram. On Monday, India recorded 24,369 fresh cases of the coronavirus, with the count in Kerala falling to 15,058. There were 218 new deaths from the virus. Case detections fall sharply every Monday due to lower testing and staff shortages over the weekend.

Chief minister Yogi Adityanath visited the venue to oversee the preparations for the event at Lodha town, about 40km from Aligarh. Deputy CM Dinesh Sharma, who has been camping here to monitor the preparations, said, “The government is paying tribute to Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh, who devoted more than three decades of his life living in exile and fighting for India’s freedom, by establishing a state university in his name.” In the past four years, the Yogi government has established 11 new universities in the state, Sharma added. The Prime Minister will also visit the exhibition models of the Aligarh node of the Defence Corridor during his visit. The new university also aims to fulfil a longstanding demand for a state university in the region. All the colleges in Aligarh division and some neighbouring districts will be affiliated to it, the chief minister had said recently. The university is being set up in a total area of over 92 acres at village Lodha and village Musepur Kareem Jarouli of Aligarh's Kol tehsil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/modi-to-lay-foundation-of-new-university-near-aligarh-today/articleshow/86182606.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||Will upload GOs to AP e-gazette site: Govt||Vijayawada: The state government has told the high court that it would upload government orders (GOs) in the AP e-gazette website instead of GOIR portal. Special government pleader C Sumon informed the court on Monday that the government will also publish all the GOs on e-gazette that were issued after it decided against publishing the orders on GOIR. Multiple PILs were moved before the high court challenging the government’s decision to do away with online publication of GOs. The court had earlier issued notices to the government to submit its response on the contentions raised in the PILs. Sumon told the HC bench comprising Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice Ninala Jayasurya that the decision was taken after the government found inadequacies in the GOIR website. The GOs that were uploaded on GOIR were not signed, whereas the orders that would be published in the e-gazette would be signed by the authorities concerned, he said. Y Balaji, arguing on behalf of the petitioners, said the government’s decision was in contravention of Right to Information (RTI) Act, adding even in the order issued after the filing of petitions, the government incorporated some objectionable clauses like barring publication of ‘secret’, ‘top secret’ and ‘confidential’ GOs. Stating there is no need for the government to shift from GOIR, he sought time to file an amendment petition to challenge the fresh GO. Responding to his argument, Sumon said the government has not done anything new but only trying to improvise the system. Even in the earlier system, GOs classified as secret and top secret never used to be uploaded on GOIR. The bench asked him what the government meant by secret and top secret. Why should there be any secret in GOs, the Chief Justice asked. Sumon said information relating to the agenda of cabinet meetings, periodical intelligence reports, and other matters connected to security aspects are classified as secret and such GOs were not published earlier also. The court posted the matter for further hearing after one week.

Altogether 4,291 applicants have been figured on the list along with honours subjects and institutions allotted to them. Their counselling and admission will start on Tuesday. PU students’ welfare dean Anil Kumar told this newspaper on Monday that the candidates would be required to appear at any of the four counselling centres made at Patna Science College, Patna College, B N College and Magadh Mahila College between Tuesday and Saturday along with the required documents. “The counselling and admission will be held from 10.30am to 4.30pm. If a candidate fails to appear at the counselling, his seat will be allotted to someone else in the second allocation,” Kumar said. The students have to download their allotment receipt and deposit the counselling fee (Rs2000 for general category and Rs170 for female, SC and ST candidates) online before reporting to the centre. The students’ documents and certificates would be verified at the counselling centres after which they may be admitted in a college. For those who won’t be satisfied with their course or college, they can opt for the provision of ‘sliding (upgradatioon)’ and wait for some time till the new upgraded list is released. “Foolproof arrangements for the counselling have been made at all the four centres by deputing sufficient number of staff to ensure that the admission seekers do not face any hardship in getting themselves admitted,” the dean said, adding that helpline numbers have also been released for the convenience of students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/pu-releases-first-list-of-candidates/articleshow/86178555.cms||B K Mishra

An initiative by NGO CRY, Kitabo ki Pitara — the roaming library run by local children aged 11-19 years — has been flagged off in ward number 80 in Taratala, as part of a project funded by Vesuvius India Limited. A bunch of youngsters from the area, trained by CRY, have been criss-crossing five slums of the Kolkata Port Trust Colony since September 6, encouraging children to join. A particular day of the week is designated as ‘library day’ when the cycles do the rounds, handing over books to children. CRY field workers have trained 105 youngsters who are running the library with four trunks of books. Trina Chakrabarti, regional director, east, said, “Many underprivileged students suffered in the last one-and-a-half-years. Some were forced to drop out of school during lockdown. Kitabo ki Pitara has let them stay in touch with studies. We have story books in three languages donated by people.” The initiative has helped many, like Madhu Kumari, who came to Kolkata three years ago and didn’t know how to sign her name. After being roped in as a library coordinator, she can now read and write and goes around her area on a cycle distributing books to kids. Similarly, Mani Balmiki, a Class V student, dropped out during lockdown last year. Mani has now started reading again after almost a year. Asim Ghosh, assistant general manager, CRY, said, “The place where we have initiated the project is not ideal for books and studies. So, we are trying to create an area where children can feel safe.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/books-in-a-box-drive-helps-slum-kids-keep-reading/articleshow/86180349.cms||---

While the government has passed orders to provide cashless treatment for dengue, private hospitals have set high fees for treatment. K Bhanu Prasad, a relative of a patient with viral fever at Vijayawada GGH, told TOI, “My aunt has been sick for the last five days. Doctors at a nursing home at Mylavaram diagnosed that her platelet count has fallen, indicating dengue. They collected Rs 80,000 for three days of treatment. I’m not in a position to bear such a huge cost and discharged the patient against medical advice in order to get treatment at Vijayawada GGH,” he said. Private hospitals are also collecting high charges for single donor platelets that cost around Rs 18,000 per unit. “I admitted my four-year-old son to a private hospital on Nakkal Road after he contracted dengue. Doctors asked me to get single donor platelets. They suggested I take platelets from a specific blood bank. I was unable to afford it and requested them to inject normal platelets, which they denied,” said B S Ravi Prasad, a private employee from Chuttugunta. Officials of the health wing have said they will soon initiate action against hospitals that are denying patients admission under the YSR Aarogyasri scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/pvt-hospitals-charge-a-bomb-for-treatment-of-seasonal-fevers/articleshow/86193940.cms||Venu Lanka

---||Business||It’s Sebi vs FPIs, brokers on T+1||MUMBAI: Markets regulator Sebi and the brokers on Dalal Street are currently in a face-off relating to trading processes in the stock market. Sebi’s insistence on continuing with a very high margin requirement for all types of cash trades, called peak margin, has been met with strong resistance from the broking community. As the issue relating to margin was being discussed between the regulator and the brokers, Sebi decided to move to the shorter T+1 settlement cycle from January 1, 2022. On the second issue, although it will be optional when it begins next year, foreign investors have joined hands with brokers, saying that post-trade procedural time lags may lead to hurdles in shifting to a shorter settlement cycle. With no solution in sight, the issue has reached the finance ministry and may even land in court, industry sources said. Sources within the regulatory body said that both the decisions were taken to make the Indian market a safer and better place. For one, the peak margin requirement will not impact investors who are buying to hold for the long term. “Trading may become a bit costly for the day-traders,” a source said. In addition, the regulatory move to slowly shift to a T+1 settlement cycle will be beneficial to traders who buy with the aim of making some profit within a day or two. Under the current system of T+2 settlement, a buyer gets the shares that he bought in his demat account on the third working day, including the day of trade. Similarly, the seller receives the money for shares sold on the third working day. Under the proposed T+1 settlement cycle, the shares and money will come to the investor’s account the next working day. The regulator believes that moving to a T+1 settlement cycle is perfectly in tune with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Ease of Doing Business’ initiative. Foreign funds are opposing the move to a shorter settlement cycle since they have to tweak their settlement processes that involve their own people, the custodians in India, depositories, clearing corporations and banks, to meet the needs. On the other hand, the regulator believes that since T+1 cycle will initially be optional for stocks that exchanges select, if the trading volumes in those stocks do not match up to the current T+2 cycle, the bourses will automatically revert to the longer settlement cycle. Over the last few months, ANMI, one of the pan-India brokers’ bodies, made several representations to Sebi. These were against introductions of peak margin and T+1 settlement cycle. ANMI had pointed out that introduction of peak margin may increase market risks, defeating its objective of reducing the same. The brokers’ body also said that if T+1 cycle is introduced, it would increase working capital requirement for brokers, extend working hours for banks and depositories, and increase settlement risks due to failure in matching trades by FPIs. Veterans of the market, however, say that discount brokers stand to gain the most from the proposed changes, since these brokerages are relatively new, their operations are fully automated and digitised. “The current situation presents a unique case: The regulator and some brokers, riding technological advancements in the financial space, are trying to move ahead. On the other hand, foreign funds who use state-of-the-art technologies for trading, want to continue to use legacy technology when it comes to settlement of trades,” said a market observer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/its-sebi-vs-fpis-brokers-on-t1/articleshow/86184289.cms||---

The one minute and 41 second-audio clip recorded her screams and desperate cries for help even as she was being violated. Police, to whom the case has been transferred from GRP, have now included it in their investigation. On Friday afternoon, the Dalit woman, 24, was on her way home from a job interview at a private school when she was waylaid, attacked and killed, her body left among a pile of cement railway sleepers. Her face had been battered. When police traced her call detail records, they found her last call had been to a friend. “I had recorded the call. I have shared it with the police,” he told TOI. In the recording, her friend keeps saying "Hello" while she screams in pain and for help before falling silent. The phone that fell from her hand kept recording her ordeal, unknown to both her and the perpetrator. On Monday, the audio clip was shared widely on local social media networks. Her phone, meanwhile, has gone missing and its location has been untraceable, Bijnor SP Dharamveer Singh said. The last ping was from Najibabad road in Bijnor. Police believe the woman struggled for "about seven minutes" before she was killed. Police sources said 12 “suspects” have been questioned so far. The key suspect is a 26-year-old labourer who lives a kilometre from the spot where her body was found. There were bruises on his body, a police source added. While police believe she was attacked by one man, the family feels there must have been more men because she was a sportsperson and overpowering her would have been difficult. Moradabad DIG Shalabh Mathur visited the site of the crime and met the woman’s family. “We have several clues and have reached the killer,” he told TOI. The FIR lodged on Friday booked unidentified persons for rape and murder. Police talked to the families who live near the place the woman’s body was found. They said they could not hear the cries because Ganesh Puja festivities were on.

While making the announcement on Friday last, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the decision had been taken due to ongoing pandemic and the persistent glitches in the e-filing portal. Ram Shankar, secretary of Patna chapter of Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), said ever since the launch of the new e-filing portal on July 7, there have been glitches. “Consequently, filing returns, which usually takes one minute, was taking a whole day. The deadline extension was necessary. But the I-T website is still not working properly. So, in my opinion, the deadline should be extended till March,” he said. Pankaj More, another chartered account, echoed similar views. “It is good that the government extended the deadline for filing I-T returns because completing the work by September 30 wasn’t easy due to the technical glitches in the new portal,” he said. Taxpayers have also welcomed the decision. Upendra Singh, a city-based businessman, said: “It will be very helpful because I will get sufficient time to file the tax return after making thorough assessment of the income and tax structure.” Ashok Kumar Verma, technical assistant at the state secretariat, said: “This is good news because I will get more time to file the return. Also, with the issues related to the new portal, certain functionalities were either unavailable or working slow. So, this decision of extending the date was somewhat expected.” Sanjay Shaw, an engineer in road construction department, said he was already worried about filing the ITR on time owing to the pandemic. “Now I am a bit relaxed as I will get sufficient time to do it,” he said. “It is a good step by the government. In fact, I want the deadline to be extended to March 31,” said Rahul Singh, an employee at South Bihar Power Distribution Company Limited.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/taxpayers-welcome-deadline-extension-to-file-i-t-returns/articleshow/86178930.cms||---

Several right-wing organizations, especially BJP and VHP, have time and again demanded the renaming of the town after removing the name of the plunderer of the historic Nalanda University. Recently, a firebrand BJP MLA demanded that Bakhtiyarpur should be renamed as ‘Nitish Nagar’ as the town happens to be the birthplace of the Bihar CM. “Why the name of Bakhtiyarpur be changed? Who will change its name? It is my birthplace. Some people keep saying meaningless and rubbish things about Bakhtiyarpur,” Nitish shot back when his attention was drawn towards a fresh demand from the BJP quarters to rename his birthplace. Nitish was responding to a media query after his weekly janata ke darbar mein mukhyamantri programme here. BJP’s Bisfi MLA Hari Bhushan Thakur, who keeps raising the issues related to hardcore ‘Hindutva’, recently said, “If Allahabad can be renamed as Prayagraj, why not Bakhtiyarpur? It should be renamed as ‘Nitish Nagar.’ This place has had a close association with Nitish since his childhood. He is a vikas purush (development man) and this would be a small gesture towards Nitish.” Nitish also recalled how a member of Parliament (MP) retorted such a demand in the House, saying, “The man who destroyed the old Nalanda University had put his military camp at Bakhtiyarpur. And now, a man who was born in Bakhtiyarpur, is building a new Nalanda University at the same location.” Earlier in September 2019, the Akhil Bharatiya Sant Samiti, an umbrella body of Hindu seers, while seeking a change in the name of Bakhtiyarpur town and railway station, wrote to the Bihar CM, “It is time to undo the sins of the past by renaming the town and the railway station.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nitish-ridicules-demand-to-rename-bakhtiyarpur/articleshow/86178973.cms||---

Those keen to pursue higher education in cities like Delhi, Kolkata and Mumbai believe getting admission in reputed institutions would be a tough task this time because of fierce competition. In a pandemic-hit year, several students have secured record-breaking marks across the country. As a result, cutoff has increased to as high as 99.5% in several Delhi University (DU) colleges. Navya Ojha, a DU aspirant who scored 98.4% in arts stream, said, “The cutoff for economics was 99.5% at St Stephen’s College (SSC). It is expected that Hindu College will have higher cutoff than SSC. Both are elite colleges and I am hopeful of getting admission in one of them. It would be a fierce competition this time as the number of students who have scored above 95% in Class XII is much more than the previous years.” Saumya, who passed Class XII from Notre Dame Academy by securing 96.8% marks, said she has applied for BCom programme at Shri Ram College of Commerce. “I am eagerly awaiting the cut-off list. As more than 70,000 CBSE students have scored above 95% this time, getting admission in reputed DU colleges has become tougher this time. Let’s hope for the best,” she added. Arpit Raj, who scored 98% in Class XII, said, “I know the competition is tough for the meritorious students this time as far as securing admission in DU colleges is concerned. I have no other option but to wait for the cutoff list.” Anjali Thakur, who secured 95.4% in Class XII, said, “Had the exams been held, there would have been a fair assessment of students. I have applied for admission in DU colleges, St Xavier’s College-Kolkata and another college in Mumbai.” As per a rough estimate, 16,704 students from Bihar have applied for admission in Delhi University colleges against 21,151 in 2020. Meanwhile, additional chief secretary of state education department Sanjay Kumar is not happy with so many Class XII students getting high marks this time. “In 2021, 99.4% students passed CBSE Class XII exams and 70,000 of them secured above 95% compared to just 17,000 in 2019 and 38,000 in 2020. This northward movement of marks across the country makes standardised testing quite difficult to fathom. It is time to re-examine the exam system (sic),” he tweeted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/high-cutoff-in-du-colleges-a-concern-for-bihar-students/articleshow/86178885.cms||Faryal Rumi

While the government has passed orders to provide cashless treatment for dengue, private hospitals have set high fees for treatment. K Bhanu Prasad, a relative of a patient with viral fever at Vijayawada GGH, told TOI, “My aunt has been sick for the last five days. Doctors at a nursing home at Mylavaram diagnosed that her platelet count has fallen, indicating dengue. They collected Rs 80,000 for three days of treatment. I’m not in a position to bear such a huge cost and discharged the patient against medical advice in order to get treatment at Vijayawada GGH,” he said. Private hospitals are also collecting high charges for single donor platelets that cost around Rs 18,000 per unit. “I admitted my four-year-old son to a private hospital on Nakkal Road after he contracted dengue. Doctors asked me to get single donor platelets. They suggested I take platelets from a specific blood bank. I was unable to afford it and requested them to inject normal platelets, which they denied,” said B S Ravi Prasad, a private employee from Chuttugunta. Officials of the health wing have said they will soon initiate action against hospitals that are denying patients admission under the YSR Aarogyasri scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/pvt-hospitals-charge-a-bomb-for-treatment-of-seasonal-fevers/articleshow/86178608.cms||Venu Lanka

But over the past month, prices in Firozabad, the epicentre of the dengue outbreak, have shot up 30 times to Rs 1,500 a litre. The reason — a fast-spreading misconception that goat milk increases platelet count. “People have been approaching me for goat milk since the dengue outbreak began last month. I used to sell it for Rs 50 a litre. With an increase in demand, the price has gone up to Rs 1,500,” said a tea seller near Sadar Bazaar now selling goat milk, who didn’t want to be named. “The prices are steep because goat milk is not produced on a commercial scale in this area. I get goat milk from a dairy supplier.” Buyers said they have been told by local medical practitioners that it could help. “An Ayurveda practitioner told me that goat milk can help fight dengue. When I asked my milkman, I was surprised to learn it costs Rs 1,500 a litre. It used to be just Rs 50. Even if we shell out the money, it is not available easily because of the demand,” said Arvind Sharma, a resident of Adarsh Nagar in Firozabad. A farmer from Narkhi block, Rajesh Pratap Singh, said that’s because demand is usually limited. “Normally, goat milk is out of demand. People in rural areas buy some for personal consumption and sell to a few regular customers. After the outbreak of dengue in Firozabad, demand for goat milk has significantly increased. Milk suppliers from cities are buying goat milk at low prices from rural areas and selling it at high margins to patients. People professionally engaged in cattle rearing are also taking advantage of the situation.” The basis for this surge in demand, however, is unfounded. “Cow and goat milk are almost equally nutritious,” said additional director, health, AK Singh. “There is no scientific proof to back the idea that goat milk can increase platelets in patients with dengue and other viral diseases. Such misconceptions are spread by quacks. People with dengue-like symptoms should consult qualified doctors and follow the prescribed course of medicines. Protection from mosquito bites will help.” Also on the list of things quacks are prescribing are coconut water, kiwi and papaya leaves. “I am trying to arrange stocks,” said the tea seller from Sadar Bazaar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/goat-milk-sells-for-rs-1-5k/l-30x-higher-as-dengue-grips-firozabad/articleshow/86177778.cms||Deepak Lavania

On top of the list of their complaints is the state of vacant sites, many of which have turned into unofficial dumpyards, not to mention the proliferation of weeds inside. Consequently, these sites attract stray cattle, pigs and dogs, much to the chagrin of the residents. That HDMC officials have failed to clean these sites despite repeated pleas by the residents has added to the public’s frustration. Ashok Nagar resident Ramesh Kulkarni, a retired government servant, called on the corporators and officials to turn their focus to various developmental projects, work on which had stalled owing to the Covid-induced crisis and the pending elections.  “The condition of several thoroughfares such as Station Road, Koppikar Road and streets in Dajibanpeth, Belgaum Galli, Shah Bazaar among others is pathetic. Owing to the delay in repairing these roads, other streets are getting congested,” rued Arvind, a resident of Station Road. Ramesh S, an activist, said that the number of pigs roaming around the streets in localities on the outskirts of Hubballi was on the rise. “The senior officials inform us that the staff are busy either with work related to Covid, or on poll duty. Now that Covid cases have declined and the elections are over, the officials must start resolving our complaints,” Ramesh said. HDMC commissioner Suresh Itnal said that the authorities, who had been busy enforcing the lockdown, were pressed into poll duty immediately after. “Consequently, other regular activities were impacted, including door-to-door collection of garbage. We have convened a meeting with the officials, and impressed on all of them the need to complete all pending work at the earliest. Tenders were invited before the elections were held, and work orders will be issued soon,” Itnal said. Admitting to the rise in the number of pigs roaming on the twin cities’ streets, the HDMC commissioner vowed to tackle the problem. “A special drive will be launched after we discuss the issue with police officials. We will also undertake cleaning of all localities,” Itnal added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/elections-over-citizens-urge-corporators-officials-to-attend-to-civic-problems/articleshow/86177226.cms||J Abbas Mulla
---||Patna||Health experts worried as Patna logs 10 dengue cases in 7 days||PATNA: Government as well as private hospitals in the city continue to witness rise in dengue and viral fever cases. Outpatient departments (OPDs) of all the major hospitals have witnessed a sudden surge in registration of such patients. Patna civil surgeon Dr Vibha Kumari Singh said 33 dengue cases have been recorded in the district since July this year, including 10 in the last seven days. Dr Singh said dengue cases were being reported mostly from areas like Kankarbagh, Bankipore, Nayatola, Danapur and Phulwarisharif. “Fogging is being done in these areas, especially in the radius of 500m from the houses of the patients. Cases of viral fever are also on the rise. All the hospitals have been asked to send the daily data of patients to the health department,” Dr Singh said. The civil surgeon said one case each of chikungunya, malaria and Japanese Encephalitis (JE) has also been reported in the district. “The only JE case in Patna was recorded in Pandarak locality on September 10. The malaria and chikungunya cases were recorded in July and August, respectively. Fortunately, there has been no death due to dengue or other vector-borne diseases in the district so far,” she added. Dr Chandra Mohan Kumar, additional professor of paediatrics department at AIIMS-Patna, said two dengue and three acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) patients were undergoing treatment at the hospital. “We usually prescribe medicines at the OPD for viral fever patients. At least 40 patients visit the OPD of the hospital per day with complaints of fever, cold, dysentery, skin rashes and body ache,” he said. Dr Manoj Kumar Choudhary, assistant professor, department of general medicine, IGIMS-Patna, said there were three dengue patients at the hospital. “Of the total patients reaching the OPD of the general medicine department, 50% are those suffering from viral fever and seasonal flu. The most common symptoms are fever, cough, loss of appetite, nausea, body ache, headache and stomach pain,” he said. Dr Manoj Sinha, medical superintendent at New Gardiner Road Hospital, said three-four viral fever patients visit the OPD of the hospital per day on an average. “Most patients are children below the age of 15 years. They complain of high fever, cold and upper respiratory tract,” he said. Regional director (east) of a private hospital on Bailey Road, Dr Talat Halim, said 10 viral fever and seasonal influenza patients have so far been admitted to the facility. “One of the patients, who is in the ICU, has been diagnosed with highly contagious influenza B. Three swine flu patients were recently discharged from the hospital after recovery,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/health-experts-worried-as-patna-logs-10-dengue-cases-in-7-days/articleshow/86178616.cms||Faryal Rumi

The police recovered five countrymade pistols from the possession of the arrested bank robbers. The injured have been admitted to Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) at Muzaffarpur for treatment. The deceased could not be identified yet. The three bank robbers arrested were identified as Rudra Singh, Prashant Kumar and Bansal. The civilians injured in the firing were identified as Budhan, a shopkeeper, and Rohit. The incident took place at around 3.45pm at the Pachrukhi branch of Bank of Baroda, about 30km from the district headquarters. The robbers entered the bank and tried to collect cash from the counter. They pressurized the manager to hand over the keys of the chest. They opened fire when the bank employees resisted the robbery. On hearing the sound of firing, some local residents alerted the Motipur police, which rushed to the spot within no time. Motipur police station SHO Anil Kumar said they faced a volley of bullets from the robbers. “We also retaliated in self-defence, causing injuries to four of them. Some of their accomplices managed to escape taking advantage of the melee following the firing on the bank premises,” the SHO told this reporter over phone. He said the two civilians, who were present there, also suffered bullet injuries. “It is suspected that they suffered injuries in the firing by the robbers,” he said, adding that investigation will throw more light on the issue. Muzaffarpur SSP Jayant Kant visited the spot. An investigating officer claimed that the loot attempt was foiled by the police. Later, a team of forensic science laboratory visited the bank and collected samples for evidence. The top police officers appreciated the role of the people for alerting the cops on time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/one-bank-robber-killed-3-injured/articleshow/86179438.cms||---

The project, according to the district administration, entails an expenditure of Rs 193 crore. Katihar DM Udayan Mishra, who is also officiating as the administrator of the municipal corporation, said three sewage treatment plants would be constructed in the town. “The project will be executed in three different phases in three years, keeping in mind the onset of monsoon. We are also working in close coordination with the Northeast Frontier Railway officials because the railways has a big presence in the town. They also need improvement in their civic amenities,” the DM added. Asked about the ongoing strike by municipal workers because of which heaps of garbage have piled up in the town, the DM said, “Only their logical demands will be met. They are being misguided. These workers could have fought for fulfilment of their demands even while working.” Mishra added gloves, fluorescent jackets and rubber boots would be provided to the municipal workers for their safety. “We are always ready to improve the working condition of the municipal workers,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/3-sewage-treatment-plants-at-katihar-soon/articleshow/86179530.cms||---

The court of special judge-cum-ADJ (III), Samastipur, Pranav Kumar Jha, also slapped a fine of Rs15,000 on each convict. Ram Balak represented the Bibhutipur (Samastipur) assembly seat in 2010 and 2015. “The court awarded 5 years’ imprisonment under Section 27 of the Arms Act and 3 years’ imprisonment under Section 324 of the IPC. However, the court said both the sentences will run concurrently. Thus, the effective imprisonment will be of five years,” advocate Manoj Kumar Gupta, who represented the CPM leader, told TOI over phone. Earlier on Friday, the court had held them guilty of making murderous attack on the CPM leader and sent both the brothers to jail. Both the convicts joined the court proceedings through videoconferencing from the jail. Gupta said Lalan had lodged an FIR at Bibhutipur police station on June 5, 2000 against Ram Balak and Lal Babu. According to the FIR, Lalan, a native of Shivnarthpur village under Bibhutipur police station, was attacked near his house. “The FIR was registered under Sections 341, 323, 307, 34 of IPC and 27 Arms Act. However, the court, after hearing the witnesses, converted section 307 into section 324,” Gupta said. After completing the hearing on September 10, the court found them guilty under Section 324 of IPC (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means) and Section 27 Arms Act, the advocate said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ex-jdu-mla-and-brother-get-5-year-jail-term/articleshow/86179045.cms||Madan Kumar

It also ordered these students to leave their hostels immediately. It is for the first time in recent years that a collective punishment has been awarded to medical students for their acts of “indiscipline” and attempt to “obstruct” healthcare services. “The action was taken on the direction of the health department. The students had tried to obstruct OPD services while protesting against the exam results as some of them had failed,” PMCH principal Dr V P Choudhary said. He added the students’ demand had nothing to do with the PMCH as the examination was conducted by the Aryabhatta Knowledge University (AKU). He said the first-year MBBS students had tried to forcibly close OPD unit ignoring the fact that hundreds of patients from far off places reach there for treatment per day. Of the 171 students who had appeared for the examination conducted by the AKU, 20 were declared unsuccessful. Earlier, a meeting of heads of all departments chaired by Dr Choudhary unanimously decided to take action against the agitating MBBS students. Choudhary said the health department has been informed about the action.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/180-first-year-pmch-students-suspended-told-to-vacate-hostels/articleshow/86178844.cms||VK Tripathi

Union home minister Amit Shah, Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar, Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Goa CM Pramod Sawant and Karnataka CM Basavaraj Bommai were present among others for the swearing in. Shah was first to congratulate Patel after he took the oath. Putting up a show of solidarity, Patel's predecessor Vijay Rupani and former deputy chief minister Nitin Patel were also present at the ceremony. As announced earlier, only Bhupendra Patel took oath as chief minister on Monday. The focus has now shifted to who will be included in the council of ministers who are expected to be sworn in after a few days. Amit Shah held a series of meetings with the new CM, state BJP president C R Paatil and other senior leaders to finalise the names in the new cabinet. PM Narendra Modi was among those who congratulated the new CM and also applauded the work of outgoing CM Vijay Rupani. “Congratulations to Bhupendra Bhai on taking oath as CM of Gujarat. I have known him for years and have seen his exemplary work, be it in the BJP organisation or in civic administration and community service. He will certainly enrich Gujarat's growth trajectory. During his five years as CM, Vijay Rupani Ji has undertaken many people-friendly measures. He worked tirelessly for all sections of society. I am certain he will continue to contribute to public service in the times to come,” Modi added. Patel’s first task after taking over as CM was to review the flood situation in some parts of the Saurashtra region following extremely heavy rainfall wherein he instructed authorities to airlift stranded persons in Jamnagar district, a release said. The new CM held meetings with top officials and took stock of the rescue and relief work being undertaken. He is expected to carry out an aerial survey of the flood affected areas on Tuesday. With state Assembly polls scheduled in December 2022, the BJP is banking on Patel, a Patidar, for poll victory. In the 2017 Assembly elections, BJP won 99 of the 182 seats and Congress got 77.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bhupendra-patel-sworn-in-ascm-focus-shifts-to-new-cabinet/articleshow/86179445.cms||---

A 60-metre stretch of the rail line remained damaged for almost five days since September 6 night following soil subsidence under the track between Sahebpur Kamal and Umesh Nagar stations. However, passenger trains, including New Delhi-Dibrugarh Rajdhani special, made their journey through the down line between Barauni and Mansi stations after the repair work on Sunday. Highly placed sources from Sonepur division on Monday said though the traffic has been restored on the line, trains are being run with reduced speed as a precautionary measure. “However, this makes little difference to passengers as the damaged stretch was only 60 metres long,” an official said. Earlier, all efforts to restore train operations on the line had turned futile on Thursday when the damaged portion caved in again following repair work when a goods train was passed over it in order to get the green signal for passenger train operations. As a result, ECR GM Anupam Kumar, along with Sonepur division DRM and other senior officials, visited the spot on Friday to take stock of the situation and expedite the repair work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/track-repaired-traffic-restored/articleshow/86179359.cms||---

They tried to close the OPD services. About 50 NMCH students were declared unsuccessful in the MBBS first examination. Holding banners and placards with slogans like ‘acche bacche hue fail, kya hamari jindagi hai khel’ and ‘Bacche nahi, system fail hua’, they alleged irregularities in the evaluation of their answerbooks. NMCH deputy superintendent Dr Satish Kumar said the students’ stir did not affect the normal functioning and doctors and paramedics attended both the OPDs and the wards. “As the number of viral fever cases has increased and over a hundred patients, including children, were reaching the hospital every day, the entire medical team remained vigilant to ensure that the agitating students should not cause any problem in providing timely medical treatment to the patients,” he said. On Saturday, similar protests was staged on the PMCH campus. Poor success rate in the MBBS first examination was also reported from other medical colleges in the state. The Madhubani Government Medical College and Hospital principal and dean of the facility of medicine at AKU, Dr Rajiv Ranjan Prasad, said over 90 students of his college were declared unsuccessful.

The group-D employees of urban local bodies in the state, mainly sanitation workers, had gone on strike on September 7 in support of their multiple demands, including regularisation of service and pay parity. Apart from garbage, waterlogging and puddles in different localities of the city after brief spells of rain on Sunday and Monday have made lives difficult for people who now fear outbreak of diseases. More than 6,500 tonnes of garbage have accumulated on roads across the city. Heaps of waste from vendors and shops were seen lying in and around the vegetable markets, commercial and residential areas. Biomedical waste was also found scattered near the health facilities in the city. Trishit Thakur, a resident of Patliputra near Alpana Market, said people are struggling with waterlogging as the drains are clogged with garbage. “The whole city has turned into a slum in just seven days. The government should do something before it is too late as the health of the citizens is being compromised,” he said. Harsh Kumar, a resident of Boring Canal Road, said the condition of the locality has turned bad and people are left with no choice but to throw garbage on the roads, parking areas and empty plots. Several people also took to social media platforms to vent their ire on the state government and the Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC). One Somnath Singh tweeted, “The entire city has become a hell. People are paying taxes not to fall prey to diseases,” he said. A PMC official, however, said all the accumulated trash would be removed shortly as 2,000 outsourced sanitation workers have been roped in for the purpose. PMC commissioner Himanshu Sharma said door-to-door trash collection would also resume along with sweeping of roads. “All the permanent sanitation workers and 90% sanitary inspectors have already returned to work. Daily wage and contractual workers have been given an ultimatum to return to work by Tuesday. Action has been taken against 21 employees for disrupting the cleaning work,” he added. Anand Kishor, principal secretary of urban development and housing department, on Monday asked all the municipal commissioners and executive officers to continue cleaning work in the ULBs by making alternate arrangements. Chandra Prakash Singh, president of PMC Staff Union, said the strike would continue till their demands were fulfilled. Meanwhile, the Congress on Monday lashed out at the state government for not taking any step to resolve the impasse. State Congress spokesperson Rajesh Rathorre said such strikes take place every year because of the bad policies of the government. He added the government should fulfil the genuine demands of the sanitation workers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/no-end-to-garbage-woes-as-strike-continues/articleshow/86178791.cms||Faryal Rumi

The museum of Botanical Survey of India has digitised the entire repository of textiles, dyes and plant paintings and has launched an e-archive this week. Formed in 1890 to study India’s plant resources and explore plants with economic utility, the BSI, in 2009, came across 15 volumes of research by Thomas Wardle to document thousands of specimens of woven fabrics dyed by natural dye. These volumes contain samples of 4,100 indigenous dyes extracted from 64 plants. There are 18 more volumes that contain samples from woven textiles used for turbans, sarees, dhotis, trousers, carpets, mosquito curtains, coats, shawls and gowns. These myriad weaving techniques — 1,700 to be precise — were preserved in these 18 volumes between 1866 and 1874 by another scholar, John Forbes Watson. “There are also 2,500-plus plant paintings of Roxburgh, who took charge of the Company Gardens or the Indian Botanic Garden as its superintendent in 1793. We are the only repository of Roxburgh paintings other than those preserved at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew, London. Scholars and even fashion designers will now get to see the heights we reached in textiles and dyes that had surprised the British in colonial India,” said BSI director A A Mao, adding that the archive also has 3,280 life-sized botanical paintings by Indian artists employed by the BSI at that time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/17th-18th-century-dyeing-weaving-methods-to-come-alive-in-e-archive/articleshow/86180028.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

Official sources confirmed the death of six people in both the districts in rain-related incidents. Close to 5,000 people were shifted to safer locations in both districts as low-lying areas started getting flooded while around100 stranded ones were rescued by teams of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and Air Force. As many as 50 people - 35 in Jamnagar- had to be airlifted as villages turned into islands. Lodhika, an industrial cluster adjoining Rajkot, recorded the heaviest rainfall with nearly 516 mm recorded on Monday. Car owners could only watch helplessly as turbulent waters swept away at least 12 vehicles in both cities. Boats were the only means of commuting in many areas of Rajkot and Jamanagar cities as all the major roads, lanes and underpasses were under water due to continuous downpour. In Rajkot, an NDRF team had to be flown in from Punjab and more teams have been called in as threat of floods looms due to increasing water levels in Aji-2 dam. Rain deficit narrows:Gujarat's rain deficit narrowed further by 14.5% following a good spell over the last week.

---||Business||Bad loan cos likely to shift focus to MSMEs||Mayur.Shetty@timesgroup.com Mumbai: Asset reconstruction companies (ARCs), which have been buying loans of defaulting corporates from banks, are likely to shift their focus to micro, small and medium enterprises, or MSMEs, as public sector lenders hive off their bad debts to a captive ‘bad bank’. PSU banks have already set up a ‘bad bank’ — the National Asset Reconstruction Company (NARC) — which will consolidate the bad loans of large corporates across all lenders and attempt a speedy recovery. According to rating agency Crisil, ARCs are likely to shift focus to MSMEs given the twin challenges of inadequate funding access and intensifying competition once the proposed NARC materialises. ARCs saw a 4% contraction in their assets under management (AUM) in FY20 followed by another 1% contraction in FY21. According to Crisil estimates, their AUM contracted to just under Rs 1.1 lakh crore. However, purchasing MSME loans would also have challenges. “During the current year, there is an ongoing resolution framework 2.0 of the RBI pertaining to Covid stress of individual and small business loans of up to Rs 25 crore, whose invocation is permitted up to September 30. So, this year flow to ARCs will be more of well provided for and collateralised mid-corporate loans where banks can expect reasonable exit price,” said UV ARC director Hari Hara Mishra. “The NARC, given its stated mandate and access to capital, is expected to dominate the large corporate segment. Mid-corporate assets, where ARCs have a relatively better recovery track record, could be a play for them as well as for stressed assets funds,” said Crisil Ratings senior director & deputy chief ratings officer Krishnan Sitaraman. The extent of bad loans purchased by ARCs had already started shrinking before the pandemic after new RBI rules made it tougher for banks to fund ARCs buying bad loans. Earlier, banks sold loans to ARCs and funded the purchase by investing in security receipts issued by the ARC, which gave them a share of the recovery. Volumes in the retail and MSME segments are unlikely to match those seen between fiscals 2014 and 2019, which was a period of growth led by corporate assets. “Nevertheless, for ARCs that get it right, it can be a profitable business. Growth remains fundamentally dependent on their ability to attract capital. Given that capital is expected to really flow towards the platform that is the most effective, it will be critical for ARCs to demonstrate their differentiated recovery ability in order to remain relevant to stakeholders,” Crisil said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/bad-loan-cos-likely-to-shift-focus-to-msmes/articleshow/86181691.cms||Mayur Shetty
---||Patna||BJP minister says Chirag in NDA, invites sharp reaction||PATNA: One day after the ‘barsi’ of the tallest Dalit leader of the state and LJP founder Ram Vilas Paswan, the BJP on Monday tried to revive the NDA connection of his son Chirag Paswan by claiming that he was still in the alliance at the national level. Asked by a mediaperson about the growing proximity between Chirag and RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s son Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, BJP minister in the Nitish Kumar led NDA government in Bihar, Neeraj Kumar Singh Babloo said, “There is nothing in this proximity and closeness between any two persons can increase. But Chirag was in the NDA, he is in the NDA and will remain in it even in the future.” His statement invited sharp reaction from the ally JD(U). “During the recent cabinet expansion, nominees from the NDA partners were inducted into the central cabinet. If he is still in the NDA, he (Chirag) should have been given a berth,” JD(U) MLC Ghulam Rasool Baliyawi said, rather sarcastically. Given the bad blood in the NDA on Chirag issue and the BJP’s bid to revive his NDA connection, RJD spokesman Mrityunjay Tiwari told mediapersons that the BJP minister (Babloo) should have “first asked CM Nitish Kumar about Chirag’s presence in the NDA. Nobody can rely on the BJP, as the insult heaped on Chirag shows. If even then the BJP appears to be cultivating Chirag, it is because it has got scared of the blessings showered by Lalu ji on him, and also due to the growing proximity between Tejashwi and Chirag”. The BJP brass, in effect, appears to be addressing and cajoling the constituents of Paswan senior, or the persons of the Paswan caste, who constitute the largest group among the Dalits in the state, observers feel. However, this has happened after Lalu blessed Chirag when the latter met him at Delhi recently. Tejashwi won the game of optics with Chirag on Sunday on the ‘barsi’ of Paswan senior, whom he described as his “guardian”. Tejashwi also touched the feet of Chirag’s mother Reena Paswan. Actually, PM Narendra Modi set the atmospherics for Babloo and other state BJP leaders, as he sent a one and half page condolence letter to Chirag, describing Ram Vilas as the greatest Dalit leader in the present whose death had created a huge vacuum. Modi also described his association with Paswan senior, calling him a leader who believed in dialogue for the resolution of disputes in a democracy. Ram Vilas had walked out of the NDA after the Godhra and Gujarat riots in 2002, and then became the NDA partner on the eve of the 2014 parliamentary elections, when the then Gujarat CM, Narendra Modi, was its PM candidate. Ironically, PM did not induct Chirag into his Cabinet in its reshuffle recently and, instead, selected Hajipur MP Pashupati Kumar Paras, who split the LJP parliamentary party and represented the LJP (Paras). Incidentally, Nitish did not attend the ‘barsi’ of Paswan senior and merely issued a condolence message. It was a grim reminder that the JD(U) has not yet forgotten the wound that Chirag caused during the 2020 assembly election by fielding candidates against the JD(U) nominees. The JD(U) strength in the assembly fell to 43 from 71 in 2015.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bjp-minister-says-chirag-in-nda-invites-sharp-reaction/articleshow/86179126.cms||Abhay Singh

---||Business||‘Will look into issues forcing tech companies to register abroad’||CHENNAI: Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Monday that she would look into the bottlenecks of the IT products sector that push Indian SaaS companies to register outside India. In an interaction with industry representatives from CII and Ficci, Sitharaman heard requests and feedback from various sectors. As a hub for the software-as-a-service (SaaS) sector, Tamil Nadu’s tech entrepreneurs stressed that IT products are set to lead to value-creation by Indian IT, and urged the finance minister to resolve a few hurdles to this. Software firm Kissflow’s founder Suresh Sambandam told the FM that with a $1-trillion opportunity, the SaaS sector can play a key role in the government’s ambitions of reaching a $5-trillion economy. But the country is losing out on wealth creation as entrepreneurs prefer to register the companies outside India due to various bottlenecks. “Despite the changes in the business models, on the taxation front, software is still treated as a consulting service and TDS is being levied on sale of essentially a product and I requested the finance minister to look into it. The legacy system of filing ‘softex’ (software export) forms for assessing the value of software also needs to be done away with as prices are transparent on the websites,” he said. “The finance minister was receptive to the issues put forward and also asked us to send the ministry a detailed note that she would look into,” Sambandam added. Cement industry, which was represented by India Cements MD N Srinivasan, sought temporary fiscal relief on coal and pet coke imports. “The price of coal has gone through the roof. What was $70 a tonne is now $170-180 a tonne. There is an import levy of Rs 400 a tonne, and for pet coke it is 11%. Considering the steep increase, we have sought a reduction in levies,” he said. Besides, the MMDR Act for minerals including limestone was impeding capacity addition in the cement sector. “We do not have any objections to the MMDR Act, but it (the levy and rules) should not impede setting up fresh cement capacities,” he said and sought the finance minister's invitation for pre-Budget meetings for South Indian cement industry. It is learnt that the representatives of the healthcare sector sought fiscal incentives for hospitals to be set up in tier-2 and tier-3 towns. Sitharaman said that the government’s disinvestment plan was on track. She also said that the Development Finance Institution announced in the Budget would be operational soon, and that liquidity is no longer a major concern. The Bank-NBFC-MFI channel has been declogged and from October 15 there would be a special drive to reach credit to those who need it, she said. She also met the representatives of Tamil Nadu Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Madurai and discussed their issues. A key demand from the industrialists was to clear the ambiguity in fixing one GST rate for all the goods covered under one chapter. They also pressed for tax exemption of essential food products, be it branded or unbranded, to motivate all the food manufacturers to go for branding and to ensure quality.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/will-look-into-issues-forcing-tech-cos-to-register-abroad/articleshow/86180826.cms||---
---||Patna||Bihar panchayat polls: Mukhiya candidate promises bike, parlour facility to voters||PATNA: The panchayat polls in the state, scheduled to begin from September 24, have some interesting contestants and their poll promises. One Tufail Ahmed has promised something for every age group and section of voters. Trying his luck for the post of mukhiya of Maqsuda panchayat in Muzaffarpur district, Ahmed in his election pamphlets promises motorbikes to every youth and a sewing machine as well as the beauty parlour facility to each woman voter in the panchayat, if elected. He has something for the elders, too, to offer — ‘khaini’ (tobacco) to chiew and ‘beedi’ to smoke. Not only that. He will also provide the facility of a helipad for the choppers, if given an opportunity to serve them as mukhiya of the panchayat. Ahmed, however, said the pamphlets had been distributed by his supporters, not him. "How can I make my supporters unhappy? They have always stood behind me. So, I accepted their suggestions," he said. The case of Aditya Kumar alias Rahul Dangi is different. As he aspired for the mukhiya post in Horma panchayat of Gaya district but did not have a case certificate to contest, Rahul got married to a fellow extremely backward caste girl in the inauspicious month of ‘Bhado’ to realise his dream. Rahul married one Sarita Kumari of neighbouring Naudiha panchayat last week as she had a caste certificate required to contest from the reserved seat. She filed her nomination papers on Friday. “I couldn’t get my caste certificate as ‘dangi’ as caste is not mentioned in any of my documents. It was a conspiracy by my political rivals to keep me away from the election. I hope people will shower their blessings on my wife, who is educated and equally formidable,” he told this newspaper. Sarita, too, exuded confidence and said she will emerge victorious. "My husband has worked hard for the poor and the downtrodden, who will support me," she added. There are some highly qualified professionals also in the fray. Arun Kumar, who opted for VRS as a civil servant (allied services), has decided to contest for the post of mukhiya of Singhwahini panchayat in Sitamarhi district. Earlier, his wife Ritu Jaiswal was the mukhiya there. She contested the 2020 state assembly election from Parihar in Sitamarhi district on the RJD ticket, but lost by 1,569 votes only. “Since my responsibility has increased and the entire Parihar assembly constituency is like my family, I will not be able to do justice with the people of Singhwahini panchayat. So my husband is ready to take that responsibility,” she told the media. Kumar, an MSc, gives online tuition to over 240 UPSC aspirants. “I think educated people should join politics,” said Kumar, who was director of the central vigilance commission when he opted for VRS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/mukhiya-candidate-promises-bike-parlour-facility-to-voters/articleshow/86179313.cms||Ramashankar

RJD founder Lalu Prasad remembered his old friend on the occasion. “Tribute to my friend during the struggle, my dear Brahma Baba, on his first death anniversary,” Lalu tweeted. Singh, was popularly called Brahma Baba because of his simple and rustic lifestyle. Leader of opposition in the state assembly, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, also held a meeting at the RJD office to pay tribute to Singh and called him as his guardian and founding members of the party. Tejashwi reminded chief minister Nitish Kumar of the demands Singh had raised from his death bed and urged him to fulfil them. Tejashwi reiterated his own demand of installing the statues of Singh and LJP founder Ram Vilas Paswan and observe their birth and death anniversary as state function. Several RJD workers also demanded that Singh’s last wishes be fulfilled. Deputy chief minister Tarkishore Prasad, BJP MP Ram Kripal Yadav, LJP MP Veena Devi and a large number of people also paid tributes to the veteran leader. Tej changes Twitter photo: RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s elder son Tej Pratap Yadav on Monday replaced the cover photo of Arjuna riding a chariot with Krishna on his Twitter account with that of Loknayak Jayaprakash Narayan. It has raised a murmur about Tej’s bitter relation with his younger brother Tejashwi Prasad Yadav. On several occasions, Tej had referred himself as the Krishna and Tejashwi as Arjuna. However, recently, Tej seems to be upset with Arjuna as well as with others in the RJD. He has even floated his own student wing named Chhatra Janshakti Parishad, after his close aide was removed from the post of Chhatra RJD president. When asked about such activities, a senior RJD leader said, “He is feeling restless as he has been sidelined. As far as floating of a committee is considered, it has nothing to do with the RJD. We have our constitution and we work accordingly.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/netas-pay-tributes-to-raghuvansh-on-death-anniversary/articleshow/86179210.cms||---
---||Business||2 directors of Zee quit ahead of today’s AGM||MUMBAI: Two non-independent directors of Zee Entertainment Enterprises have resigned from the company ahead of its annual shareholder meeting on Tuesday. Manish Chokhani and Ashok Kurien have resigned from the position of non-executive, non-independent directors of Zee with immediate effect, the company informed the stock exchanges late on Monday. While the former cited “changed life circumstances and perspective” after Covid for his resignation, Kurien mentioned “his pre-occupation” behind the move. Following the changes, Zee now has seven members, including MD & CEO Punit Goenka, on its board. Interestingly, Zee’s largest shareholder Invesco has asked the company to call for an extraordinary general meeting seeking the removal of three directors — Chokhani, Kurien and Goenka. Simultaneously, the global asset manager, with an 18% stake in Zee, has also sought the appointment of six nominees on the board. Zee sent Invesco’s letter dated September 11 to the stock exchanges on Monday. But Chokhani and Kurien have already resigned. A Zee spokesperson said, “The company will take necessary action as per applicable law.” Goenka and his family hold 4% in the company, which was founded by his father Subhash Chandra. The changes at Zee’s board come after proxy advisory firm Institutional Investors Advisory Services (IiAS) raised corporate governance concerns at the media house, advising shareholders to vote against the re-appointment of Chokhani and Kurien at its Tuesday AGM. Following the developments, Chokhani has ceased to be a member of Zee’s nomination & remuneration and risk management committees of the board, the company added. Similarly, Kurien has ceased to be a member of the company’s corporate social responsibility and stakeholders relationship committees. Invesco has proposed Surendra Singh Sirohi, Naina Krishna Murthy, Rohan Dhamija, Aruna Sharma, Srinivasa Rao Addepalli and Gaurav Mehta for independent directors’ positions at Zee. The US-based fund has also asked Zee to seek an approval for the proposed directors’ appointment from the information and broadcasting ministry. Invesco, which manages assets worth $1,525 billion, has been a shareholder of Zee for 19 years but it hiked its stake to the current level from 8% only two years ago.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/2-directors-of-zee-quit-ahead-of-todays-agm/articleshow/86184574.cms||Reeba Zachariah
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Poor water supply sees farmers shun paddy||ONGOLE: Notwithstanding the fact that both major projects on the Krishna river—Srisailam and Nagarjuna Sagar—are brimming with water, thanks to the heavy rains in the last month, the irrigation department has decided to release water only for irrigated dry (ID) crops under Nagarjuna Sagar Right Canal (NSRC) ayucut. Surprised by the move, farmers in the Addanki branch canal (ABC) region under NSRC ayucut have decided to give up paddy cultivation and shift to other crops. The farmers are slowly moving towards chilli, cotton and jowar. Paddy sowing was not taken up even in 50% of the anticipated areas in Addanki, Darsi, Purchur and Ongole assembly constituencies due to insufficient water supply. Paddy had been cultivated on about five lakh acres under Nagarjuna Sagar ayucut. “The irrigation department has failed to assure us full quota of water from Sagar project despite repeated appeals. We have no option but to switch to other crops,” said M Seshareddy of Addanki. He said officials were not responding even after local legislators intervened. Bolla Bramhanaidu, legislator of Vinukonda in Guntur district, had raised the issue of inadequate release of water from Sagar canals at the recent district review committee (DRC) meeting. He said the farmers were laughing at them for releasing the water on a shift basis (Vara Bandi) even when the reservoirs were in spate. Expressing surprise over the decision of the irrigation department, in-charge minister Ch Ranganatha Raju directed the officials to ensure full supply of water in the entire ayucut under NSRC. Krishna waters enter Prakasam district via Addanki branch canal after meeting the needs of farmers in Vinukonda region. Vinukonda and Addanki branch canal are at the tail-end of NSRC. Taking a cue from the ordeals of ryots in Vinukonda, farmers in Addanki are swiftly moving to commercial crops.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/poor-water-supply-sees-farmers-shun-paddy/articleshow/86178446.cms||Samdani MN

This clearly confirms that the customers returned to market looking for a personal mobility solution,” said Ravi Bhatia, president, JATO Dynamics. Auto analysts say the rebound started in 2020 itself but got derailed due to the second Covid wave. The problem now is not demand but supply due to chip shortage. “While the long term growth story remains intact for the Indian car industry, short term headwinds persist, especially in backdrop of rising commodity and fuel prices. September and October sales will be low, because of chip shortage,” said Ashish Modani, VP, ICRA.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/at-2mn-units-jan-aug-sees-second-highest-auto-sales-in-10-years/articleshow/86180654.cms||Nandini Sen Gupta

Founded in Chennai, the customer relationship management software maker amended its prospectus on Monday to state that it plans to sell more than 28 million shares at a price range of $28-32 each. This translates into $912 million being raised at the top end. “We estimate that our net proceeds from the sale of our Class-A common stock that we are offering will be approximately $804 million...assuming an initial public offering price of $30 per share, the midpoint of the estimated price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus,” Freshworks said in its updated regulatory filing. “As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds to us from this offering. However, we currently intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering for general corporate purposes, including working capital, operating expenses, and capital expenditures. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire complementary businesses, products, services, or technologies,” the company added. When it originally filed its IPO paperwork in August, the company hadn’t disclosed the amount it was setting out to raise. Freshworks was last valued at around $3.5 billion in its funding round in 2019. A report by Reuters projects that the IPO would value the company at around $9 billion. The company also said that 5% of the Class-A common stock to be issued is reserved for certain individuals, including “family members of our officers or other employees and certain other individuals associated with us” as part of a directed share programme. The company has reported a 53% surge in revenue for the six months ended June 30.

According to a report by rating agency ICRA, a dip in disbursements and portfolio rundown in the absence of any moratorium unlike the first quarter of the previous fiscal resulted in the loan books shrinking. This has put the brakes on the recovery trend witnessed in the third and fourth quarters of the previous fiscal. Although the report did not disclose the absolute extent of the decline, according to industry data, NBFCs’ loan books are estimated to be around Rs 25 lakh crore in FY20, which is double of the figure five years earlier. Most of the assets are in housing, vehicle loans, lending to MSMEs, real estate and structured finance. Since Covid, NBFCs have been facing intense competition from banks for retail loans. Disbursements for non-banks declined in Q1FY22 and was down by about 55% on a sequential quarter-on-quarter basis. There are indications of a sharp revival in July 2021 on the back of the pent-up demand. However, sustainability of the same would depend on the broader macroeconomic indicators the report said. As a base case, ICRA expects overall disbursements for FY22 to be higher by 6-8% on a year-on-year (Y-o-Y) basis. This is on the back of the two consecutive years of Y-o-Y contraction. ICRA VP & sector head (financial sector ratings) Manushree Saggar said, “From an AUM perspective, the sector is expected to grow 8-10% in FY22. Growth would be driven by the improvement in demand from all key target segments vis-a-vis FY21, on the back of a low base.” The localised lockdowns during the second wave also resulted in the asset quality for the non-bank entities weakening sharply in Q1FY22. About 45% of the NBFCs’ loan accounts — largely individuals and MSMEs — had availed of the moratorium as of August 2020. ICRA has projected an increase of 50-100 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point), net of recoveries and write-offs, in the overdues in FY22, assuming there are no further Covid-induced lockdowns. “While asset quality pressures persist, the increase in the overall provisions, which currently is 1.7x the pre-Covid levels (December 2019), provides some comfort. This would give the entities adequate leeway to technically write off and clean up their balance sheets. In this context, it is worth noting that write-offs remained high in Q1FY22, but lower than the levels witnessed in Q3 and Q4 of FY21,” Saggar added. NBFC credit costs spiked sharply in Q1FY22 as write-offs remained elevated and provisions went up in view of the increase in the overdues. While housing finance companies’ non-performing assets (NPAs)/stage 3 also increased during the period, credit costs moderated vis-a-vis Q4FY21 as provisions did not go up sharply like the NBFCs and write-offs were negligible. Consequently, net profits plunged during the quarter to the lowest level in the recent past. “Assuming there are no further lockdowns, ICRA expects the earnings performance to improve in the subsequent quarters as credit costs would moderate with the reduction in overdues from June 2021 levels. The pre-tax return on average managed assets (also profit before tax, or PBT, in %) for FY22 are likely to remain similar to FY21 levels (NBFC 2.4-2.6% & housing finance companies 1.9-2.1%). Optimistically, if the collection efficiency trends post a steady and healthy revival and if slippages remain contained, then PBT% may also benefit from reversals in provisions,” Saggar reiterated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/2nd-wave-hits-nbfcs-loan-books-in-q1-hsg-fin-cos-remain-flat/articleshow/86181785.cms||Mayur Shetty

According to sources, the 2638 people currently working in the plant in the outskirts of Chennai will be affected by the management's decision to shut operations. “The union was not consulted before the management announced the shutdown. Now they are saying they will not reconsider their decision to stop production. But the union is looking for employment, not a severence package,” said a union source. The union has also indicated that it is willing to work with minimum wages for the next two years in order to reduce losses and allow the company to turn around. The discussions will continue on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ford-india-begins-shutdown-talks-with-union-at-chennai-plant/articleshow/86180702.cms||---

Considering a petition challenging the GO, the court passed interim directions to maintain status quo until further orders and posted the matter for hearing after four weeks. One Ramanjaneya Raju had moved the high court challenging the notices issued by the Amaravati Metropolitan Development Authority, asking him why his allotment should not be cancelled as he had purchased a plot that was given in lieu of the assigned land taken by the government under the land pooling scheme. The state government had issued GO-316 in 2019 to conduct an inquiry into the assigned land transactions in Amaravati. Raju moved the court arguing he did not purchase assigned lands in Amaravati, but had purchased the returnable plot from the farmer to whom the plot was allotted in lieu of the assigned land. He argued that as he was not involved in any assigned land transaction, the notices issued by AMRDA are arbitrary and illegal. — Srikanth Aluri||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hc-orders-status-quo-on-assigned-lands-go/articleshow/86178562.cms||Srikanth Aluri

The panel was set up by the state to probe Singh’s allegations that former home minister Anil Deshmukh had set a target for cops to mobilise Rs 100 crore from restaurant and bar owners. A senior police officer told TOI that they have initiated the process of serving the bailable warrant on Singh. But, he did not confirm whether it was served or not. Singh has been on medical leave since April. This is the first time in Maharashtra police force’s recent history that a warrant has been issued in the name of a serving IPS officer for securing his presence. Singh has not attended any of the proceedings saying he has challenged the validity of the panel in the Bombay HC. His lawyer sought adjournment saying the HC may pass an order soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maharashtra-police-begins-warrant-issuing-process-on-param-bir/articleshow/86182679.cms||---
---||Business||RBI: No a/c freeze till December for want of KYC||MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Monday reiterated that until December 2021, banks cannot freeze accounts if the customer has not done a periodic KYC (know your customer) update. The central bank said this while cautioning the public not to fall prey to fraudulent messages seeking bank details for KYC updation purposes. The RBI said it has been receiving complaints/reports about customers falling prey to frauds being perpetrated in the name of KYC updation. The RBI asked the public not to share key information like account details or passwords with unidentified persons or agencies under threat of account freeze. Many customers have avoided visiting branches during the pandemic, which has provided fraudsters an opportunity to use KYC as a reason to engage with customers. “The usual modus operandi in such cases include receipt of unsolicited communication, such as, calls, SMSs, emails urging him/her to share certain personal details, account / login details/ card information, PIN, OTP, etc or install some unauthorised/ unverified application for KYC updation using a link provided in the communication,” it said. The RBI also said that it has made the process of KYC updation much simpler. The directions on simplified process comes in the wake of banks asking customers to fill multiple sheets of all-in-one document merely to get a periodic proof of address and identity. The central bank on Monday said that NBFCs and payment system operators seeking to obtain Aadhaar e-KYC authentication licence can submit the application with the RBI. In May 2019, the finance ministry had come out with a detailed procedure for processing of applications (under the PML Act) for use of Aadhaar authentication services by entities other than banking companies. “Accordingly, non-banking finance companies (NBFCs), payment system providers and payment system participants desirous of obtaining Aadhaar Authentication license — KYC User Agency (KUA) license or sub-KUA license (to perform authentication through a KUA), issued by the UIDAI, may submit their application to this department for onward submission to UIDAI,” the RBI said in a circular. The RBI has also provided the format of the application.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-no-a/c-freeze-till-dec-for-want-of-kyc/articleshow/86184224.cms||---

The girl, who was very bright academically, harboured ambitions for modelling, which her parents objected to. She got in touch with modelling groups on Instagram and went to Hyderabad alone, but got scared and called up a cousin for help. Police said she has been brought back home safely and was not harmed. The girl had scored more than 95% in class X and is now in class XII. For six months, her parents were egging her to prepare for JEE. She had told them she was interested in modelling. About a month ago, she and her father had a row, after which she promised her parents she would make it so big that they would be stunned. On September 10, she vanished from home. Her parents approached Samta Nagar police station and a missing complaint was lodged. Police checked CCTV footage and found that her phone was intermittently off. Her location was first traced to Wadi in Karnataka and later to Hyderabad. She touched base with a modelling group on social media and planned to go to Delhi. But she took a train to south India and alighted at Hyderabad, where she checked into a hotel. Few days later she got scared and contacted a cousin in that city. Four police teams from Mumbai got her back on Monday. Police counselled her to complete her basic education before enrolling into acting school or modelling.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/kandivli-student-takes-off-for-modelling-in-hyderabad-city-cops-get-her-back-home/articleshow/86182723.cms||---

It could start clearing up from the second half of Tuesday as the clouds recede, said weathermen. A low-pressure area over northwest and adjoining west-central Bay of Bengal had intensified into a deep depression triggering rain along the coastal areas of Bengal and Odisha since Sunday. Kolkata received 15.2 mm rain till 5.30pm on Monday. “The system has started moving further away from Bengal towards Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh. So, the impact of the system will now be marginal. We expect a moderate spell of rain either late on Monday or early on Tuesday. After that, Kolkata and south Bengal will receive normal monsoon rain which would be light and sporadic,” said Regional Meteorological Centre director GK Das. The system is likely to weaken into a depression over 24 hours. A bad weather warning had been issued for the coastal areas of South 24 Parganas and East Midnapore on Sunday. Tourists and fishermen were asked to stay away from the sea. Hotels in Digha, too, were asked to warn tourists not to venture near the sea.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/skies-likely-to-clear-up-today-forecasts-met/articleshow/86180385.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||BJP heeds ‘Ab ki Baar, Patidar CM’ call||Gandhinagar: By choosing Bhupendra Patel, a Kadva Patidar, for the post of Gujarat chief minister, the BJP high-command once again acknowledged the importance of this politically influential community. Patidars make up for nearly 13% of voters in Gujarat. With assembly elections 15 months away, Patel has a colossal task to reverse the setbacks suffered by the BJP in the 2017 polls, when it lost some 13 seats to Congress in its own bastion Saurashtra. Later, the saffron party did recover some losses, but it was mainly due to some senior Congress leaders like Kunwarji Bavaliya and Jawahar Chavda, crossing the aisle to grab ministerial berths in the Rupani government. The BJP regained significant electoral ground in the local body polls last year by winning all 31 district panchayats, nearly 180 of 260 taluka panchayats and all municipal corporations. Bhupendra Patel, the 59-year-old rookie politician, is said to be a moderate Patidar face. In contrast, outgoing deputy CM Nitin Patel who had bargained for the finance portfolio after two days of sulking in 2018, is considered inflexible over many issues. Bhupendra, who is on the board of some key community institutions like Sardar Dham and Vishwa Umiya Foundation, and others has decent acceptance among the Kadva Patidars, who have a huge population in north Gujarat and Ahmedabad. Besides Patidars, Bhupendra is closely associated with Dada Bhagwan Foundation, a spiritual organization, which has a large number of followers in Gujarat. In fact, he is fondly called 'Dada' by his supporters The former AUDA chairman’s selection also points to BJP’s discomfiture after Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) stellar show in Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) elections earlier this year. AAP workers have also started an aggressive groundwork in north Gujarat and Saurashtra. Naresh Patel, president of Khodaldham Temple Trust, the influential Leuva Patel religious organization, had been vocal for a Patidar as a CM after Rupani’s departure. In fact, interacting with reporters in June, he had been critical of the state government’s handling of the Covid-19 situation while praising AAP’s Delhi government. He could not be reached for comments despite repeated attempts. Ramesh Tilala, trustee of Khodaldham Trust, told TOI: “It’s a matter of pride that Gujarat has got a Patidar CM. However, we are a religious and a social organization which considers all communities equal. We hoist the national flag at our temple and devotees from all castes come to seek blessings of Maa Khodal.” Recently, Union health minister Mansukh Mandaviya, a Leuva strongman, had tried to assuage the community’s sentiments and described the relationship between Patidars and BJP like that of “an umbilical cord and navel.” In Bhupendra’s elevation, the BJP has also sought to neutralize the potential impact of Hardik Patel, the feisty Patidar quota stir leader, who joined Congress and became its working president. The young Kadva Patel leader still has a significant following among the community youth and the BJP can ill afford to oversee the possibilities of him swaying votes in Congress favour in 2022. T G Jhalawadia, vice-president, Sardardham, said, “Bhupendrabhai has worked a lot for Sardardham and Vishwa Umiya Foundation and has made immense contribution to the community's welfare. But he is a man of all communities, who believes in doing good for all people of Gujarat. So, he must not be seen as the leader of a particular community. He is a man of integrity and absolute honesty.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/bjp-heeds-ab-ki-baar-patidar-cm-call/articleshow/86182705.cms||---

No other political party has announced a candidate list till date. SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal had already announced 22 candidates so far and the remaining 42 candidates were added on Monday. Sukhbir, who is Lok Sabha MP from Ferozpur, would be contesting from his old assembly constituency, Jalalabad. Party patron and former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal’s name is not in the list, but the party has not announced any candidate from the Lambi assembly constituency from where Badal senior is sitting MLA. The Punjab assembly has 117 seats. As SAD declared its candidates, it threw cold water on expectations of dissenters of Bahujan Samaj Party who have been demanding that a few seats where their party is strong should be allocated to the BSP. While SAD has already swapped two seats with BSP after the original seat-sharing formula was announced and BSP state president Jasbir Singh Garhi had said that there would not be any further swapping, Akal Dal announced candidates on all the other seats where BSP has considerable presence. It included Banga, Adampur and Phillaur where SAD already has three MLAs. The party has announced candidates in two other seats – Garhshankar and Chabbewal - which were being mentioned by BSP dissenters. From these seats, party has fielded former MLAs Surinder Singh Bhullewal Rathan and Sohan Singh Thandal, respectively. After severing ties with old ally Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over the contentious farm laws, SAD had in June this year announced the alliance with BSP. Before this, SAD and BSP contested the 1996 Lok Sabha elections in an alliance in Punjab. The pact give SAD 97 assembly segments and BSP the remaining 20. SAD has to announce just 33 candidates now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sad-1st-off-blocks-names-64-candidates/articleshow/86182766.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Police plans for safer Mumbai: Fixed night patrol at stations to bright roads||MUMBAI: Permanent night patrolling vehicles between 10pm and 7am outside railway termini and maximising patrolling of isolated stretches are among a slew of measures Mumbai police commissioner Hemant Nagrale announced for women’s safety on Monday, following the death of a 32-year-old who was brutally sexually assaulted inside a tempo at Saki Naka last week. Her family has demanded the strictest possible punishment for the culprit.  “My sister was not a pavement dweller... She lived in a shanty. We would meet on and off. Her children are being looked after by our mother. We want the government to take immediate steps to get them a house and fund their education,” said the victim’s sister. In an internal circular for the force, Nagrale directed that deserted stretches in the jurisdiction of every police station should be identified and patrolling should be maximised through beat marshalls and mobile vehicles. “Such stretches need to be brightly lit and the police station can coordinate with the BMC to arrange for illumination. Make a proposal to the concerned agencies to install CCTVs at such locations,” said Nagrale. Every police station would be required to make a list of sexual offenders—arrested in cases of rape, molestation or child abuse in the past—and take preventive action against them. “No distress call made to the police control room, particularly from a woman, should be ignored,” said Nagrale. “The role of the control room is key. Provide help to the caller immediately and the supervisor of the control room should keep tabs.” Unclaimed or abandoned three-wheelers or trucks must be removed from streets. If the owner is not willing to move them away, the police should seize such vehicles and take action, said the commissioner. Currently, patrolling is monitored digitally via QR codes. Around a dozen QR codes are affixed at various locations in a neighbourhood and patrolling cops are required to scan these on an app to confirm their presence. Nagrale has directed QR codes be affixed in deserted stretches too. “Public toilets for women must be brightly lit and a mobile patrolling van posted closeby. If a woman is spotted moving alone at night, enquire if she needs help or drop her to her destination if needed.” He instructed patrolling vehicles be deputed outside termini and stations where long-distance trains halt. “If a woman commuter is travelling alone, inquire if she needs help or organise a vehicle to drop her off to her destination. The vehicle number and the driver’s contact number should be noted and an enquiry made with the driver to check if he dropped her safely,” he said, asking the force to step up action against drug abusers and peddlers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-police-plans-for-safer-city-fixed-night-patrol-at-stns-to-bright-rds/articleshow/86182808.cms||Nitasha Natu

In the seven years between 2010 and 2017 — five years as standing committee chairman Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) and two years as AUDA chairman — Bhupendra Patel came to be known for his ability to pacify standoffs between the bureaucracy and the civic body’s elected wing. These were the tumultuous years when infrastructure projects worth crores and the implementation of impact fee regulation were at stake. In 2010, soon after being elected as a councillor from Thaltej, he was elevated as AMC standing committee chairman. Back then, Ahmedabad was projected as the model for Gujarat’s progress by the then chief minister Narendra Modi. This was based on the implementation of Rs 2,700 crore worth of Jnnurm projects, Rs 1,100-crore BRTS project, the two phases of Rs 1,200-crore Sabarmati riverfront and social housing for weaker sections and last, but not the least, Ahmedabad’s entry into the Unesco’s tentative list of world heritage cities in 2011. “I remember him as an excellent negotiator between the executive and the elected wing in the AMC. He brought to the table a practical approach to dealing with people, budgets, and policy-making. It was a privilege working with him,” says former municipal commissioner and Lokpal member I P Gautam. It was this quality that led the BJP to continue him as the AMC chairman for four consecutive terms — the first in the history of AMC. His negotiating mettle was tested when development works in the newly acquired areas of new west zone — Prahladnagar, Bodakdev, Thaltej, Gota, Ghatlodia, Sarkhej, Sola and Jodhpur — were undertaken especially while new roads and drainage lines were being laid. In 2012, Patel won the then chief minister Narendra Modi’s appreciation when he suggested three consecutive impact fee cuts to popularise the building regularising scheme. “He was also the force behind enrolling several societies under the PPP scheme for concretising private society roads and reparing street lights. The nitty-gritty of the scheme was suggested by Bhupendra Patel,” says AMC councillor and water supply committee chairman Jatin Patel. Between 2015 and 2017 as AUDA chairman, Bhupendra Patel was pivotal in pushing forward several infrastructure projects, which includes flyovers, roads in Sanand and Bopal as well as civic infrastructure projects which helped BJP in the 2017 elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/his-stint-at-amc-auda-won-modis-appreciation/articleshow/86182771.cms||---

While dismissing the rumours that the government was introducing schemes only for Dalits and ignoring other communities and castes, the CM reiterated that the beneficiaries of Dalit Bandhu scheme need not repay the financial assistance nor were they asked to take up only a particular trade or business. “They can take up any financial activity of their own choice,” he said and asked the officials to create awareness at the grassroots level on the scheme. The CM said monitoring was key and asked district collectors and Dalit Bandhu committees to work in tandem for successful implementation of the scheme. “Every Dalit Bandhu beneficiary will have a bank account and committees will be formed from the village to the state level,” he said. “Like parents who take care of their children, officials should take care of Dalits under the scheme.” The CM advised Dalit youth to shoulder the responsibility of making the scheme a success. He said a Dalit security fund was created while addressing the preparatory meeting on implementation of Dalit Bandhu. Ministers Koppula Eshwar, G Jagadish Reddy and Puvvada Ajay Kumar, MLAs, MLCs, MPs, ZP chairpersons, collectors of four districts attended.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cm-kcr-licencequota-for-dalits-inmedical-wine-shops/articleshow/86184946.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Her resignation was on Sunday accepted by the department. The department will also recover Rs 1.5lakh from Priyanka Mishra, an amount spent on her training. Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Muniraj G said, “According to UP Police norms, the constable had quit before finishing her training. So, she will have to bear the cost of training.” In the controversial video that she had uploaded, Priyanka was purportedly seen lip-syncing a dialogue, “Come to UP, kids as young as five know how to use country-made guns.” Constable Priyanka was also seen brandishing a revolver in the 21-second video while sporting a uniform. “I was told on Sunday that my resignation has been accepted. I will pay the money in a while,” Priyanka told TOI. “I seriously didn’t know that the video would create such a row. I am being trolled continuously,” she said. The video invited widespread criticism on social media platforms, prompting senior police officers to intervene. Constable Priyanka was grounded and sent to police lines. A probe was also ordered against her. Meanwhile, amid the uproar she resigned from the force.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/agra-woman-cop-resigns-days-after-her-controversial-instagram-video/articleshow/86177981.cms||---

The incident came to light after the girl’s mother lodged a complaint with the local police. According to police, the accused, who happens to be a physiotherapist, has been sexually abusing his 13-year-old daughter since March last year. Police said, earlier, the accused used to molest the girl when she would be sleeping next to her mother. He later started to abuse her whenever his wife was not around. The girl was raped even on September 8 and 10. Unable to bear the torture, the class 7 student had even begged her mother to let her stay at her grandmother’s place. Noticing some behavioural changes in her, the girl’s mother inquired as to what happened to her. Eventually, the girl explained the abuse that has been taking place for over a year. Later, the woman approached the police and lodged a complaint. A case was registered under section 376 of IPC (rape) and under relevant sections of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012. The investigation was later transferred to Disha police. The accused was taken into custody and interrogation is on. Meanwhile, the victim has been sent to Vijayawada Government General Hospital (GGH) for medical examination. This is third such incident this month in Krishna district where a minor girl is raped. Just five days ago, police arrested a man working with a prominent architecture college in the city for sexually assaulting a five-year-old girl at Nunna police station limits.

---||Delhi||Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal urges states to act on farm fires||NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has appealed to the central government to mandate farmers in Delhi’s neighbouring states using the bio-decomposing technique to manage harvest remnants rather than burn them and aggravate the air quality in the winter months. Kejriwal said on Monday that a central government agency had found the bio-decomposer developed by Pusa Institute successful in curbing stubble burning and that he planned to meet the Union environment minister to urge him to adopt this solution for stubble burning. Last year, Delhi government had the bio-decomposer sprayed on farmlands in the capital and found it decayed the crop stubble in around 20 days in time for fields to be readied for the next sowing. The state government got the bio-decomposer solution audited by Wapcos, a Union water ministry undertaking, and its report endorses the bio-decomposer’s efficacy. Wapcos surveyed 79 farmers in 15 villages in four districts. “90% of the farmers said the stubble decomposed within 15-20 days when earlier it took 40-50 days,” Kejriwal claimed at Monday’s press conference. “The soil needed to be ploughed 6-7 times earlier, but just once or twice after using the decomposing spray. The organic carbon content of the soil increased up to 40% and the nitrogen level 24% with the stubble ending up as manure. Bacteria content too increased seven-fold while the fungal content went up three times.” The CM said these so boosted the soil quality that wheat sprouting was 17-20% higher than normal. “Almost half the farmers said the amount of DAP fertilisers they had to use decreased from 46kg/acre to 36-40kg/acre, while the new wheat crop yield went up 8%,” Kejriwal claimed. It is expected that from October Delhi’s air will become more polluted as farmers in the neighbouring states start clearing their fields of the rice harvest remains for the winter wheat sowing. Kejriwal said there was now a solution to this perennial pollution source from farm fires. “Pusa Institute has developed a proven and unbelievably cheap bio-decomposer. We tested it on 1,935 acres in 39 villages of Delhi. The stubble left behind quickly decomposes when the solution is sprayed. There is no need to uproot or burn the stubble,” he said. Urging the neighbouring states to take to this method to address stubble burning, Kerjiwal said state governments could have it sprayed in fields for free as Delhi did. “All that the state governments have to do is to adopt this bio-decomposer and all that the Centre needs to do is to mandate the states to employ this solution,” he said. “Earlier, there was no solution. Now there is. By using this and halting the burning of crop stubble, all of us can get freedom from the seasonal pollution.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/kejriwal-urges-states-to-act-on-farm-fires/articleshow/86180555.cms||AlokKNMishra
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Marine Drive raises a stink over Rs 90 lakh defunct public loo||MUMBAI: The city’s costliest public toilet, built by the BMC at a cost of Rs 90 lakh at Marine Drive in 2018, has become defunct. Local residents complained that the flushes are not functional and regular walkers and joggers gripe about the stench emanating from the public toilet. But the BMC said that the vacuum technology used in the public utility isn’t working properly and they will fix it as soon as possible. TimesViewIt is appalling that the BMC’s so-called state-of-the-art 'VIP toilet' at the Marine Drive promenade, built at a cost of close to Rs 1 crore, is not working. Now the BMC will have to spend more money to make it functional aqain. Instead of temporary repairs, the BMC must find a permanent solution to the choked drainage and sewer lines and ensure that such fiascos do not happen and money is not wasted.Local resident Bela Shah said: “The toilet has become a stink hole; we can’t even walk near it. The BMC spent so much money to set it up, but has failed to maintain it. The BMC must get an agency to maintain it and ensure that it remains usable at all times.” Colaba MLA Rahul Narwekar from BJP also wrote to assistant municipal commissioner Chanda Jadhav of A ward complaining about the “immense inconvenience” caused to joggers and walkers, especially senior citizens, due to the non-functional public toilet. Jadhav said: “We will check and repair the toilet’s sewage system at the ward level and get it back in working condition soon. If there is a need to connect with the main sewer line then we will coordinate with the sewerage operations department.” According to officials, the state-of-the-art public toilet does not have a sewage connection; there is a septic tank below which is cleaned every alternate day through a suction tank. But because of the heavy usage, the tank runs out of capacity leading to the stench in the area. The closest sewer connection is across the road and the BMC was planning to use a trenchless technology, which costs around Rs 40 lakh, to connect the toilet to the sewer line so that there is no need to dig up Marine Drive promenade. However, this plan never took off. Atul Kumar of the Narim-an Point Churchgate Citizens Association said: “The BMC should have planned the sewer connection better before the toilet was built. Since it is operational, the BMC must find a permanent solution to the stink. The toilet also has a very small footprint and it fits into the art deco character of the heritage precinct.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-marine-drive-raises-a-stink-over-rs-90l-defunct-public-loo/articleshow/86182940.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

With the two private firms — BVG India and AG Environ Limited — failing to deliver the goods, there are 181 black spots where citizens dump garbage in the open.In 2019, when the NMC replaced Kanak Resources Management Limited with two firms, it showed intent to improve door-to-door garbage collection but in vain.Due to irregular garbage collection, TOI found Dharampeth, Laxmi Nagar, Hanuman Nagar and Nehru Nagar zones with the most black spots. Heaps of garbage in these areas bear testimony to the inept services of the two firms and also the lack of effective monitoring by the NMC.Even the NMC’s solid waste management study spotted most of the black spots in south-west and west Nagpur assembly constituencies with Laxmi Nagar and Dhrampeth zones having 42 locations each where citizens allegedly dump garbage. Gandhibagh has 28 black spots, Satranjipura zone 18, Nehru Nagar zone 12, Mangalwari zone 9, Dhantoli zone 8 and Ashi Nagar zone 8.There are two perceivable reasons why people throw garbage in the open — either out of habit or due to irregularity in door-to-door garbage collection.One such area where garbage was dumped along the roadside is Shatabdi Nagar. Residents of the locality told TOI that AG Enviro workers visit their homes once a week. Despite numerous complaints, Hanuman Nagar zone and local corporator Nagesh Mankar did nothing to resolve the issue, they alleged and hence, people of the locality have started dumping garbage in an open plot in the area.“A majority of the people continue to dump waste in the open. Stray dogs and cattle gnaw at these bags and spread the waste across the road,” said Naresh Sawarkar, a local resident.“One can’t walk past this nearly 200-metre stretch without covering the face due to the nauseating stench,” said Sameer Balki, another resident.Similar is the story of Prabhag number 14 in Dharampeth zone. Here, too, the garbage lifting vehicle comes twice a week, say residents. So, here, too, residents throw garbage in the open, admitted Dharampeth zone’s SWM officials. Today, the place has turned into a mini dumping yard, forcing residents to live in unhygienic surroundings. The NMC has the power to penalize those creating black spots but who will penalize the two private firms for their inefficiency, ask residents. Shiv Sena leader Nitin Tiwari, who exposed the garbage scam, said the NMC can levy a fine of Rs 100 per vehicle for not collecting and transporting door-to-door garbage. “The penalty amount is minimal and hence there’s large-scale irregularity in lifting door-to-door garbage,” said Tiwari. The agreement and the terms and conditions were prepared in a manner to favour the two firms, claim sources.Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari had constituted a five-member committee headed by ruling party leader and senior BJP corporator Avinash Thakre to conduct an inquiry into irregularities by the garbage lifting firms. Thakre has already convened several meetings. A final meeting of the committee will be held on September 16. The committee will table its report before the next general body meeting, Thakre told TOI.ZONES—BLACK SPOTSLaxmi Nagar—42Dharampeth—42Hanuman Ngr—12Dhantoli—5Nehru Ngr—12Gandhibagh—28Satranjipura—18Lakadganj—5Ashi Ngr—8Mangalwari—9Total—181 GROUND REALITY* Rs 100 can be levied as fine per vehicle for collecting and transporting waste*AG Enviro covers zones like Laxmi Nagar, Dharampeth, Hanuman Nagar, Dhantoli and Nehru Nagar* NMC paying Rs1950 per MT to the firm * BVG covers zones like Gandhibagh, Satranjipura, Lakadganj, Ashi Nagar and Mangalwari* NMC is paying Rs 1800 per MT||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/stinkpur-181-black-spots-make-many-areas-garbage-dumpyard/articleshow/86174929.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

Leader of opposition (LoP) in Punjab assembly Harpal Singh Cheema said Navjot Sidhu should now stop playing the letter game on the issues of Punjab and the problems of the farmers and should instead get the matters resolved by his government. He said the Congress state president had now recalled reforms in the agriculture sector, getting the farmers out of the crop cycle, along with all the other issues, as the state assembly elections were approaching. “If Sidhu could not come up with any concrete promise or policy in his meeting with the farmers’ leaders, then what did he do there? If AAP leaders could decide to give support on the spot after listening to the views of the farmers during the meeting, why can’t the Congress state president Navjot Sidhu do so too?” Cheema alleged, “The chief minister did not fulfil any of his promises to the farmers; as a result, they have to wage struggle against the Punjab government, like against the Union government to get their demands met. Be it issue of sugarcane prices or the procurement of crops from mandis.” Capt Amarinder had lost the trust of his MLAs and ministers and there were rebellions against him within the Congress, he claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/stop-drama-of-writing-letters-over-farm-issue-aap-to-sidhu/articleshow/86182930.cms||---

---||Nagpur||Nagpur: Two girls killed as speeding car rams compound wall near Bharat Nagar Futala turning||NAGPUR: Two girls Rashi Yadav (20) and Bhavana Yadav (18) were killed in a ghastly accident that occurred near Bharat Nagar Futala turning on Amravati Road late on Sunday night. The victims were returning from an eatery on the city’s outskirts along with friends and family members. Police said the four-wheeler was probably driven at a breakneck speed and went out of control on the slopy stretch near Bharat Nagar Square Futala turning before veering to the wrong side and crashing into compound wall of a house. Rashi and Bhavana, both seated on the back seat, suffered grievous injuries. The car was allegedly driven by Chirag Jain, 22, while his friend Girish Ramlakhani (21) was in the front seat. Both were saved by the airbags. Chirag had fled from the spot soon after the accident, but was arrested by Ambazari police with the help of cyber cell experts. Bhavana’s elder brother Jai and Rashi’s sister Mona were returning in another car, which was behind. Senior inspector Ashok Bagul of Ambazari police station said the critically injured girls were rushed to a hospital. “The relatives were very upset and had to be calmed down at the hospital,” he said. “We have sent the blood sample of the accused driver (Jain) to ascertain whether he had consumed alcohol,” said Bagul, adding the citizens must follow the norms of Motor Vehicle Act. The victims’ family members said the youngsters may have decided for an outing to celebrate Bhavana’s birthday, which was on September 6. “Bhavana had taken admission in a Pune college. She was supposed to join the college, but was waiting to get vaccinated,” said the family member. Bhavana was the youngest among the siblings. Sources said Rashi too was pursuing event management course in Pune and had returned to Nagpur during the lockdown. Her father is into mining, it’s learnt.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/2-girls-killed-as-speeding-car-rams-compound-wall/articleshow/86175013.cms||Soumitra Bose

---||Nagpur||Regularization letter dues paid to Nagpur Municipal Corporation, NIT says pay it again||NAGPUR: For the last five months, over 500 plot owners are running between Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) for getting regularization letter (RL). Despite paying the requisite RL charges to NMC, the plot owners have been asked by the NIT to pay it again as the civic body has cited inability to transfer the revenue it received for issuing the RLs to the trust. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B assured to resolve the issue soon. NIT chairman Manoj Kumar Suryawanshi too said the issue will be sorted out with the NMC. Guardian minister Nitin Raut said he has not received any complaint in this regard. “I will resolve the dispute between the NMC and NIT,” he said. Former standing committee chairman and corporator Vijay Zalke told TOI, “The state government had, on August 27, 2019, made the NMC sole planning authority for the city. All pending applications for regularization of layouts and plots along with building plan sanction were handed over to the NMC by the NIT itself. It was only after that the NMC regularized one layout, several plots and sanctioned building plans.” Zalke added that after completing the process, NMC issued demand notes to plot owners for RL charges. “In the meantime, government on April 9, 2021, restored powers of the NIT as planning authority for seven schemes. By this time, over 500 plot owners had paid the charges to the NMC, but the process to release the RLs was pending,” he said. “After the government decision, NMC handed over all pending cases to the NIT. It was the responsibility of NIT to release the RLs after verifying receipts issued by the NMC. However, NIT did not release the RLs and instead demanded charges from the plot owners,” he said. “The plot owners had submitted applications and paid the charges to the planning authority of the day, i.e NMC. As they have already paid the charges, NIT should release the RLs immediately,” said Zalke. Sources in the NIT claimed Raut wants the NMC to deposit the charges paid by the plot owners with the civic agency.” Sources in the NMC said Raut is supporting the NIT as Congress’s rival party BJP is ruling the NMC. “There is no provision to transfer NMC revenue to other agencies,” the source added. Zalke said, “The then BJP government had appointed NMC sole planning authority of the city. However, the MVA government reverted the decision.” After NIT areas were brought under NMC control, the civic body has regularized one unauthorized layout, issued RLs to 1,244 plots and sanctioned building plans on 2,140 plots. The state government’s back and forth over the jurisdiction has resulted in disputes between the NMC and NIT. TOI had reported how plot owners in a few layouts in green belt schemes are running from pillar to post as there is no clarity whether the NMC or the NIT is the planning authority for the area. Tussle between the two authorities is also continuing over maintenance of gardens and playgrounds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rl-dues-paid-to-nmc-nit-says-pay-it-again/articleshow/86182993.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Nagpur||Poll letter part of protocol. All parties will look for alternatives: Wadettiwar||Nagpur: After the state election Commission (SEC) announced that the local body bypolls will be held on October 5, state cabinet minister Vijay Wadettiwar said all political parties in Maharashtra will work together “to find alternatives”. While reiterating that the SEC’s letter on the bypolls declaration was in compliance with the Supreme Court’s decision, Wadettiwar said the government remains committed to safeguarding the OBC community’s interest. Wadettiwar said, “The SC decision is binding on all and the SEC letter is part of that process. At the same time, all political parties in Maharashtra have unanimously stated that OBC community must get political reservation. Now we shall all meet again and discuss what alternatives are before us and then proceed accordingly.” Speaking to the media earlier in the day, before the bypoll dates were declared, Wadettiwar said alternatives included legal and political solutions. “Maybe we can approach the SC again and seek data from the Centre. Apart from this, all political parties can ensure that they give tickets to OBC candidates in the same proportion as the quota would have provided,” said Wadettiwar. He also said that even the pandemic situation needs to be considered. “There is a threat of the third wave coming in the last week of September or October, and this is something that most medical experts agree on,” said the senior Congress leader. But what if no viable alternative is found? Wadettiwar said, “Then the bypolls will be held as per the SC’s directives. And it will be a chance for the OBC community to see how many parties give tickets to their candidates. Since all parties have committed to giving OBCs their rights, such a situation will be ideal to field candidates from the community.” Already two sessions of an all-party meet regarding the OBC issue were held, where the general consensus was to delay the polls till the political reservation issue is sorted out. Wadettiwar said the SC decision last week took them by surprise. “We were not expecting it. Our all-party discussions were in the last phase and since the general polls (for local bodies) is scheduled for February so we thought that there is time,” said Wadettiwar. The senior Congress leader known for his aggressive style slammed the opposition for ‘politicizing’ the issue. “There are some people who continue to blame the current government for the mess. But it’s the Central government which is not willing to share data related to OBC. The data compilation was completed in 2015, so why nothing was done about it till 2019? Still I do not want to start a blame-game and would prefer that everyone comes together to fight for OBC rights,” said Wadettiwar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/poll-letter-part-of-protocol-all-parties-will-look-for-alternatives-wadettiwar/articleshow/86175082.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Sewri jeweller arrested for Rs 11 crore customs duty evasion||MUMBAI: The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) has arrested a jeweller from Sewri for allegedly evading customs duty amounting to around Rs 11 crore by importing 345kg gold worth Rs 100 crore and selling it in the domestic market, instead of exporting it in the form of jewellery. The export was to be carried out as per the condition prescribed in the Advance Authorization Scheme, which allows duty free import of inputs, which are physically incorporated in an export product. Pankaj Bhandari of Bhandari Gold and Jewellers Pvt Ltd was arrested on Friday. Bhandari’s lawyer Ravi Hirani claimed that he has been falsely implicated in the duty evasion case. But DRI officials claimed that Bhandari exported gold-coated copper jewellery by misdeclaring it as gold jewellery and diverted the imported duty-free gold to the domestic market at a profit, by melting and recasting it. This effectively led to the violation of the ‘actual user condition’ imposed under the scheme. The DRI carried out a search of Bhandari’s office in Sewri and his residence. Investigations showed that he had imported 145kg of gold bars of 99.5% purity without payment of customs duty under the scheme. Further, it transpired that Bhandari had imported 11 consignments of gold weighing around 200kg since 2015. The officials then put one consignment on hold and during the examination, in the presence of two export valuers, it was found that the jewellery to be exported was artificial/copper coated with gold. The declared value of the said export consignment was around Rs 3.7 crore. Officials said that Bhandari is a repeat offender, who is involved in another customs case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-sewri-jeweller-arrested-for-rs-11cr-customs-duty-evasion/articleshow/86182986.cms||Ahmed Ali

He added the CID booked cases against 18 people including Vemuru Hari Krishna Prasad, who is considered to be a close aide of the then chief minister Chandrababu Naidu.  Speaking to the media here on Monday, Gowtham Reddy said the CID found nearly Rs 121 crore was siphoned off through illegal means when Naidu was at the helm.  He alleged Rs 8.2 crore was misappropriated in the purchase of power meters. “There are no bills for the purchase of cables and set-top boxes to the tune of Rs 62.06 crore. About Rs 29.20 crore was released to different contractors without submission of proper bills . Similarly, the board of directors in the SFL were found to have misappropriated Rs 20.25 crore by changing the approved designs of the project,” said Gowtham Reddy. He added the CID has found that Krishna Prasad, one of the board directors during the TDP regime, played a key role in the scandal. “TDP government also invited bids for maintenance worth Rs 321 crore without following tender rules.”  Gowtham Reddy said Krishna Pradsad was MD of Tera Smart before joining the APSFL board. “Tera Smart was awarded several contracts after Krishna Prasad joined the SFL. Tera Smart was initially suspended and blacklisted following complaints from several competitors. Surprisingly, the suspension was lifted to handover the key contracts,” he said.

---||Nagpur||Maharashtra govt failed to brief AG: BJP||NAGPUR: State BJP president Chandrakant Patil said leaders of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government cannot give excuse of failures in court cases by blaming Maharashtra’s attorney-general. On Sunday, Congress leader Nana Patole alleged that AG Ashutosh Kumbhakoni’s professional performance seems ‘suspicious’ because the state seems to be losing cases in recent times. In addition, Patole said that Kumbhakoni was appointed during the previous regime but still continues in the same post. Patil said, “Who briefs the AG? It is the state government’s job to discuss with the AG about the current court cases and the stand which needs to be taken. It’s a very desparate move if someone says that the AG’s performance is suspicious.” The veteral BJP leader added that under Devendra Fadnavis’ regime, there used to be a detailed review of legal matters. “We would sit late in the night and discuss all pending matters with the AG. There used to be a clear cut understanding on what the state government’s stand is regarding every issue and how we can better present our side before the courts,” said Patil. Former cabinet minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule said that Patole ‘unknowingly’ spoke the truth. “If he says that AG has not been presenting the state properly in the court then that reflects on the government too. It is the MVA government which has failed in fighting the legal battles in a proper manner,” said Bawankule. “If the case is in Supreme Court, the state should have briefed the AG on what steps to take. The AG does not appear in the Apex court, but hires legal eagles to fight on the state’s behalf. So Patole has accepted that it is in fact the state government which has failed,” said Bawankule. Senior BJP leader Sudhir Mungantiwar said, “Leaders of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) have no idea on how to speak about someone. Before speaking one must also keep in mind the decorum of the position being talked about.” He said Patole’s statement was childish. “They are unable to run the government and are failing miserably. Kumbhakoni is just being made a scapegoat. These people are just busy in arresting people or making wild allegations and sometimes tied in fighting each other,” said Mungantiwar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/state-govt-failed-to-brief-ag-bjp/articleshow/86175131.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

---||Nagpur||Maharashtra: Agencies asked to submit final plan on Lonar Lake in 15 days||NAGPUR: The high powered committee (HPC) set up on the direction of Nagpur bench of Bombay high court has asked agencies to submit final plans in 15 days for the conservation, protection, and development of the world-famous Lonar crater in Buldhana district. On August 25, the court had asked for the development plan in three months. A meeting of the 13-member committee chaired by the Amravati divisional commissioner Piyush Singh was held on September 4. A copy of the note circulated during the meeting reveals that the user agencies like MTDC, Neeri, Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran (MJP), town planning, irrigation, public works, forest, and irrigation departments, Lonar Municipal Council, Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), involved in the overall development had come with old plans as per the provision of funds. Divisional commissioner Singh was not available for comments. However, sources who attended the meeting said the working of this committee will be on the lines of Shegaon Development Authority. “As the development of Shegaon has been completed, the entire team of staff there will be deployed for Lonar crater development committee as mentioned in the GR issued on August 24, 2021. The meeting also decided to set up several sub-committees as mentioned in the GR for various works, which will report to the HPC headed by the divisional commissioner,” they said. One of the sub-committees has already been set up to bring discipline in several research projects being conducted by Indian and foreign researchers and institutes on the crater. Till now it was very difficult to keep track of these research projects and use the research outcome for enhancing the conservation of the crater in the absence of such a system. “The committee under the vice-chancellor includes a scientist from Neeri, wildlife expert Kishor Rithe from Amravati, and Akola deputy conservator (wildlife) as member-secretary. Rithe has also been included in the 13-member committee as the NGO member,” said officials. The agencies have been asked to submit expenses incurred on various works till now and proposed funds required in 2021-2022 for completion of these works. On February 5, 2021, state chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had visited Lonar and reviewed the works. He had ordered construction of watchtowers for tourists, use of electric vehicles, better roads, and restoration of ancient temples by ASI. A proposal of Rs84 lakh has been submitted for the same. MJP has demanded Rs67 crore for a sewage treatment plant (STP). This underground project will stop sewage water from entering the crater. It includes pumping machinery, leading mains, collection system, repairs to old STP, express feeder etc. In the first phase Rs37 crore has been demanded. The forest department too has sought Rs3.65 crore to remove Prosopis near the lake area. It has also sought Rs15 crore to acquire 342 hectare private land near the crater. It also needs Rs10 crore for electric vehicles, display boards, viewing platforms, walking tracks etc. Sources said the committee has also asked the archaeology department and School of Architecture, Bhopal, to present an integrated site management plan (ISMP), which will include urban conservation, tourism guidelines, preparation of heritage bylaws etc. BOX WHAT WILL BE DONE * Development of 5km Kinhi-Lonar Road and 8km Lonar-Mantha bypass, which is a shortcut to Lonar from Mumbai, Aurangabad, Konkan * Expansion of guesthouses with four suites in progress * Installing chain-link fencing around ejecta blanket area of crater * Shifting of government and municipal council offices in Lonar area * Heritage conservation of centrally protected monuments, mostly temples * Installing digital water level indicators at Lonar Sarovar * Shifting of crematorium on the fringes of the lake and construction of toilets * Cloakrooms, open-air restaurant, audiovisual room, watchtowers, viewing platform, walking track etc||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/user-agencies-asked-to-submit-final-plan-on-lonar-in-15-days/articleshow/86183017.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

Out of these, the admission of over 1.58 lakh students has been completed. Principals of the government schools say that a big chunk of these admissions has been for Classes 9 and 11, and they attribute this increase to the economic losses faced by the parents due to Covid-19. According to data released by the directorate of education (DoE), 2,36,522 applications were received for classes nursery to Class 12 in about 1,030 government schools. So far, 1,58,484 students have been admitted and the process is continuing. This data is for what is called non-plan admissions — for those students who had been studying in private schools. However, the data on last year’s non-plan admission was not provided. Tweeting about this, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said, “This is happening for the first time in India.” This is happening for the first time in India https://t.co/3BiH64Ggcg— Arvind Kejriwal (@ArvindKejriwal) 1631502397000There have been two cycles of admission season this year for non-plan admissions. Delhi government allowed students from private schools to take admission in their schools even without a transfer certificate. It said the department would on its own get the TCs from the respective schools. Aruna Anand, head of Government Girls Senior Secondary School, Ambedkar Nagar, said: “This year many more students from public schools in Delhi and even outside, like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, have come to take admission. Some could not pay the fees in the public schools and some shifted. These are mostly students from smaller public schools.” In this particular school, maximum admissions have been for Class XI. Government Co-ed Sarvodaya Vidyalaya, Sector 8, Rohini, has a similar story. The maximum number of admissions here too have taken place in Class 11. “Last year, we had about 150 non-plan admissions but this year it is about 400, from Class I to XII. One of the reasons is that many parents have lost their jobs due to the lockdown. The reputation of our school has been good with the constant good results we have achieved and many are also quite impressed with our new school building,” said A K Jha, head of the school. However, at Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya No. 2, West Punjabi Bagh, Class 9 seems to have been the popular choice for non-plan applicants. The head of the school, Madhu Gupta, said there has been no increase in admissions for classes VI-VII and XI. With this increase, according to the DoE, the total number of enrolled students in Delhi gover nment schools has touched 17.67 lakh. In 2020-21, the figure was 16.28 lakh, while in 2019-20, it was around 15.05 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/1-6-lakh-delhi-students-move-from-private-to-government-schools/articleshow/86180624.cms||Shradha Chettri

He said the BJP had done nothing for the state but increased petrol and diesel prices and sold all public sector undertakings (PSUs) and its properties. The Centre had created a ministry for disinvestments in PSUs. “The Telangana government is known for winning the hearts of people and trust and creation of assets, while the BJP is known for selling the PSUs and government assets,” he said. Harish Rao participated in various programmes in Kamalapur in Huzurabad constituency like distribution of cheques to weavers, party important workers’ meeting and inauguration of central lighting system in the town. He also participated in a bike rally in the town. He said the entire state was looking at Huzurabad result and both Congress and BJP were fighting for the second position. “TRS winning the upcoming bypoll is imminent. Our victory is necessary for continuation of the development in the constituency,” the minister said.

Police said no ransom call had been made so far and they were looking at CCTV camera footage of nearby areas to trace the kid. Family members said the boy had gone cycling but minutes after he left, his bicycle was seen on the road and locals saw some person carrying a boy. According to police, Krishna Shardul Sharma, living at Brijpuri locality along with his father and grandfather, is a student of class 4. “He had gone cycling after studying with his grandfather. When he did not return till 7.45pm, the family members launched a hunt to find him. When they could not find him, they intimated us about the incident. Locals claimed that they saw a person carrying a boy who looked similar to the missing kid,” said a senior officer of Pratap Nagar police on Monday. DCP (west) Prahlad Krishnia said, “So far, no ransom call has been made, which gives an idea that the boy must have gone with someone he was acquainted with. The father of the boy lives in Jaipur while his mother lives in Uttar Pradesh. We have gone through the CCTV camera footage of nearby areas and have constituted teams to trace him. We are looking into every possible angle to find the missing boy.” Police have kept the phone numbers of the family members on surveillance. “The family is poor and the boy cannot be kidnapped for ransom. It appears that some family dispute between husband and wife could be the reason behind the boy going missing. We are in touch with the family members and police officers in plain clothes are alert in the area from where the boy went missing,” said a senior officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/8-yr-old-goes-missing-family-alleges-kidnap/articleshow/86183036.cms||---

As against Rs 92,605 crore funds generated under CSR in India in the past six years since April 1, 2014, when the move was initiated, Punjab got only Rs 631 crore, or just .68% of the total funds, under CSR. The report was released on Monday by Punjab CSR Authority head Sandeep Goyal with data collected by Sattva Consulting, a social impact research, strategy advisory and implementation firm. Punjab chief secretary Vini Mahajan released the report in a virtual programme where principal secretary Hussan Lal, Rakesh Bharti and HPCL MD Prabh Dass participated. Education, health care and environment & sustainability are the core sector which got the biggest pie of the funds while the oil, gas, coal and petroleum, telecom and automotive industries contributed maximum. The companies have to contribute 2% of the average net profit in last three years. As per the report, Rs 631 crore of CSR funds cumulatively have been invested for social development projects in Punjab in the past six years. While 26% of the funds has been spent towards education, 21% has been spent on healthcare and15% towards environment and sustainability. This is in line with the broader national trend of these three sectors being the top areas of investment by corporates, cumulatively accounting for 55% nationally, against 63% in Punjab. Out of total of Rs 631 crore, Punjab received Rs 341 crore of CSR funding in the last two years, accounting for 54% of the total CSR funds in these two years. The top four spending companies - HPCL Mittal Limited, Trident Limited, International Tractors Limited and Bharti Infratel Limited - have contributed 25% of the total CSR spend that the state has received over the years. Oil, gas, coal and petroleum and telecom are the highest contributing sectors, providing 22% and 8% funds, respectively. Punjab had 29,761 registered companies (1.67% of India) by 2018 and 365 (1.18%) participated in CSR in last six years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/punjab-got-just-0-7-of-total-csr-funds-generated-in-india/articleshow/86183075.cms||Neel Kamal

He was leaving for his office in Chandni Chowk when he felt the ground vibrating near Robin Cinema. “Within a few seconds, an entire building was reduced to a mass of rubble,” exclaimed Kumar. “Then there were people screaming and running in panic in the dust cloud.” Local residents rushed to save lives and began clearing concrete slabs and iron rods with their hands to locate survivors. Deepak, 21, recalled hearing the voice of a child screaming, “Uncle, Uncle!” Deepak had been in his room when he felt what he thought was a tremor.  “My mother told me a building had crashed down and people were trapped. I ran to the spot and saw several residents removing rubble while some were recording videos on their phones,” he said. He joined the rescuers in digging around for survivors, suffering minor injuries on his right leg during the process. The official rescue teams took their time reaching the disaster site, the residents claimed. “The building collapsed at around 11.30am. At around 1.50pm, the first surviving boy was spotted and pulled out. A few minutes later, another was rescued,” a resident said. There were piles of rubble, clothes, damaged air conditioners and household items, and crushed vehicles in the vicinity.  Those who lived in the collapsed building were stoically collecting whatever they could find of their belongings from the debris.  A group of women sat on the roadside, talking among themselves. Jayashree, one of them, said, “I gave some water to a mother who had lost her kids. She was weeping and refused to drink, all the time dazedly repeating one thing, that her children would emerge from debris alive.” The locals were caught by surprise by the fall of the three-floor building. A 66-year-old resident, Rajesh Bharti, was standing on the balcony when he heard a roar.  “I thought it was thunder, but then I heard people screaming. I rushed out and saw the horrific scene for myself,” he said. Shashank Tiwari was standing near the transformer when he too heard the explosive noise.  “I thought a gas cylinder had burst until I learnt about the disaster. I ran to the spot, but everything there was obscured by a cloud of dust,” he added. Locals expressed apprehension about several buildings in the area being in a similarly dilapidated condition. One of them was at least closed off. A notice pasted there read: “This building is declared dangerous by North Delhi Municipal Corporation.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/some-thought-it-was-sound-of-thunder-others-cylinder-blast/articleshow/86180717.cms||Abhay Singh

Prayagraj Development Authority (PDA) has invited an Expression of Interest (EoI) from interested parties for this project. “We aim to transform Triveni Pushp into a hub for promoting cultural and recreational activities, promoting agriculture and river tourism-based activities besides providing space for a range of religious, cultural, social and public gatherings all-round the year," said PDA vice-chairman, Arvind Chauhan. As per the EOI, issued by the PDA, the agency selected by the department through the tender, the premises of Triveni Pushp would be rented out for 10 years (subject to the annual extension based on achievement of performance level benchmark will be decided during Tender process). The bidder can organise small, medium and large-scale events and activities. If all goes according to plans, the site as a ‘Mini-Indian village’ would have its amusement and recreational zones besides food courts offering yummy treats besides theme-based temporary hotel set-ups. “The site would host several activities including organising ‘Yoga Shivir’ (camps), amusement zone, food courts, recreational zone, agri-tourism based activities, river tourism-based activities, government, political, social and corporate events and meetings, seminars and workshops for various stakeholders, religious gathering, social gatherings and events, exhibitions and promotional events, conclaves and summits etc”, informed Chauhan. Besides, events like talk shows and performances, public gatherings and cultural events, theme-based temporary hotel setups can also be carried out, he added. This list of activities is non-exhaustive and indicative as applicants can suggest more options, said the PDA VC. Triveni Pushp was the dream project of former UP Vidhan Sabha Speaker and former governor of West Bengal Keshari Nath Tripathi and it was due to his efforts that a tower came up in Arail, Naini, in 2003. Triveni Pushp is already a tourist attraction. It has a magnificent tower architecture visible in the southeast direction from the confluence of Triveni Sangam, surrounded by 12 small lawns. Triveni Pushp is a viewpoint and a major tourist attraction visited by almost all national and international delegations, travellers and pilgrims during Kumbh- 2019. Among other things, there are specimens of many mythological characters and other religious replicas such as Ram Janma Bhoomi Temple, Badrinath Temple, Kedarnath Temple etc also here. The peaceful environment and well connectivity of the venue are expected to facilitate it to grow further. From the top of the tower, one can have a magnificent view of Sangam and the historical Akbar Fort. Triveni Pushp premises also has models of prominent temples located in Ayodhya, Badrinath and Kedarnath along with a statue of Gautam Buddha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/pda-plans-to-revamp-triveni-pushp-invites-eoi/articleshow/86182287.cms||---

Necessary action against delinquent officials, if any, will be taken based on the report, he said.“The building is about 50-60 years old structure consisting of ground, first, second and third floors on an approximate area of 40-50 square yard,” stated North Delhi Municipal Corporation in a press statement.At the ground floor, there was a sweet shop whereas the upper floors were apparently residential in nature. “The upper floors were vacant and no construction activity was going on. Further, no complaint regarding any unauthorised construction in the said building was received from any source in the building department. At the incident site, it was noticed that the front portion of the building had collapsed. Till evening, two casualties were reported,” the north corporation added.The civic body had carried out the survey of dangerous buildings/structures in all its six zones between May and June. During the survey, 699 properties/structures were found in dangerous condition, while 444 properties/structures were identified for carrying out necessary repairs. “During the survey of Civil Lines Zone, 89 properties were found dangerous. Twenty properties were found dangerous in municipal ward-13, where this unfortunate incident happened. Out of the 20 dangerous properties, nine properties fall on the same road i.e. Main Road, Old Sabzi Mandi. But it was not identified as dangerous during the survey,” the press statement added.The civic body claims to have issued notices under Section 348 of the DMC Act, 1957 to the dangerous buildings. “To prevent occurrence of any such incident in future, a thorough survey of the areas will be conducted again in the next 48 hours, especially of the buildings that have been already identified as dangerous.

---||Hyderabad||Cheaper alternative to dialysis treatment in advance testing||HYDERABAD: An alternative dialysis treatment called allo-haemodialysis being developed between Virinchi Hospital, RRI and Vivo Bio Tech Ltd (Hyderabad), is currently being tested at an advanced stage of development in large animals. It is expected that this treatment—which is likely to bring down the cost of dialysis to a 100th of the current cost—will be ready for human usage globally in the next 2-3 years. While hemodialysis machines currently available at hospitals are a huge set up requiring constant supply of water of the highest quality and a dialysis technician to operate it and cost around Rs 7 lakh to Rs 8 lakh, this new treatment costs around Rs 70,000. What makes it unique is that a family member or a friend could sit with the patient as a buddy and the healthy person’s kidney works for the kidney patient to filter out the impurities. “ Allo Haemodialysis (alloHD) is a novel hemodialysis modality whereby the patient is dialysed against a healthy subject (“buddy”). “The buddy’s healthy kidneys then excrete the solutes and fluid transferred from the patient. The whole set up is less than half the size of a microwave oven and there is no need for a technician or water supply in this. This will make dialysis an easy process, doable at home,” said Dr K S Nayak, Chief Nephrologist, Virinchi Hospitals who has worked on the project with Dr Peter Kotanko, medical director, Renal Research Institute, New York jointly and their respective teams. The method has been successfully tested on American Yorkshire pigs and was found to have similar effect as dialysis. The reason for choosing the animal is that its weight is equivalent to that of a human male and the kidneys of humans and pigs are quite similar.  “Social, economic, environmental, and technical barriers prevent a wide-spread use of current dialysis technologies. As a nephrological community, we have not yet developed impactful solutions to address this problem,” added Dr Nayak.

When devotees and gurdwara members objected, Paramjeet Singh of Ludhiana blew the cigarette smoke towards the staff, following which he was allegedly thrashed and nabbed by devotees and members of SGPC task force, it was alleged. Though the gurdwara management claimed that the incident took place at 4.30am, police said they got information only at 10.30am. As per Sikh Rehat Maryada (Sikh code of conduct), tobacco consumption is prohibited. Takht Sri Kesgarh Sahib is one of the five highest temporal seats revered by the Sikh community Police have registered a case of hurting religious sentiments against Paramjeet, 38, on a complaint by Sarwan Singh Lodhipur, the sewadar of the takht.

Ropar SSP Viveksheel Soni said they were investigating the incident. SGPC chief blames anti-Sikh forces For Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) president Jagir Kaur, the incident was committed by “some anti-Sikh forces” who wanted to disturb the peaceful atmosphere of Punjab by committing heinous acts. “In the past too, many crimes of sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib have taken place in Punjab,” she said She asked the government to find out the intention behind the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/man-accused-of-smoking-at-kesgarh-sahib-arrested/articleshow/86183153.cms||Bharat Khanna
---||Delhi||Teams use tech, canines to rescue those trapped||New Delhi: The use of technology, canines and coordination marked the rescue efforts at north Delhi’s Sabzi Mandi where three people died in a building collapse on Monday.CL Meena, assistant divisional officer, Delhi Fire Services, said, “Earth movers were called and three of them started moving the rubble. Later, we used cutters to remove iron rods.” The firemen were joined by two NDRF teams. Shriniwas, assistant commandant, said 50 NDRF personnel were at the disaster spot. “We made holes in the concrete wall and used victim-locating cameras to see if anyone lay there trapped,” he said. “We also used a life-detector machine, but finding no one buried in the debris, we called off our operation.”NDRF dogs searched the whole area twice, trying to sniff out anyone trapped in the rubble.Civil defence volunteers controlled the crowd, while Delhi Police extended a helping hand to the rescuers. “We are stopping people from coming in the way of the JCBs. It is dangerous,” an officer said.While there was efficient coordination among the various groups involved in the operation, several political functionaries also visited the site to check on the progress of rescue operations. These were of little use to those who lost their kin. Nitin, 38, who works at the crockery market at Sadar Bazar, lost his children in the collapse. “They said goodbye when I left for work in the morning,” he said in a choked voice. He mumbled that his wife, who was injured, was asking several questions about the kids. “I haven’t informed her about them,” he said, mumbling that all he now wanted was justice for his children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/teams-use-tech-canines-to-rescue-those-trapped/articleshow/86180687.cms||---

Stating that hundreds of Indian workers, including many from the state, are being ill-treated by their employers in the Gulf country, he said the workers have sought the assistance of the Indian government to return to their home towns. The AP government would extend all possible support to the Centre in repatriating the affected workers from Bahrain, Jagan said, and requested Jaishankar to direct his officials to contact either the resident commissioner at AP Bhavan in New Delhi, or any official in the chief minister’s office at Tadepalli. Meanwhile, fisheries minister Seedri Appala Raju spoke to some of the workers in Bahrain and assured them that the government would make all arrangements for their safe return to their native places. He also told them that he would personally contact the Telugu association in Bahrain and seek their help in repatriation of the affected workers.

---||Mumbai||Rollercoaster rides on Mumbai roads even after ‘33,000 potholes flattened’||MUMBAI: Although the BMC claimed last week that it had filled over 33,000 potholes across the city, the ground realty is quite different. Several roads in the city continue to remain full of potholes leading to major traffic snarls and bumper to bumper traffic. Commuters, residents groups and corporators have pointed out that several important junctions are full of potholes slowing down traffic. While scores of motorists have complained about potholes along the busy Jogeshwari-Vikhroli Link Road, some said the ROB near Nahur station connecting Mulund-Goregaon Link Road to the Eastern Express Highway was also in bad shape for the past few days and everyone had a bumpy ride. TimesViewThe BMC has been making tall claims about filling potholes. But potholes are conspicuous on several roads across the city and leading to not just traffic snarls but accidents. The BMC must put in place a transparent mechanism to report and act on potholes. In fact, its old system of allowing citizens to track and report about roads in disrepair must be restarted. Action must also be taken against engineers and contractors who fail to fill potholes on time, including penalty and blacklisting.The most inconvenient, perhaps, is Dahisar check naka, where potholes have cropped up even under a welcome arch. “The potholes are waterlogged making it tough for motorists to figure out which part of the road is safe to use,” said an accountant who commutes via Dahisar check naka daily. “The problem is even greater on the Mira-Bhayander side of the toll naka,” said a traffic cop. During peak hours, a stretch usually crossed in 30minutes can take up to two hours, said motorists. At Andheri Lokhandwala, potholes have cropped up near RTO while commuting from Lokhandwala circle to Four Bungalows. Venting their ire on social media, motorists posted pictures of potholes on Western Express Highway service road at Jogeshwari, TH Kataria Marg from Matunga Road flyover to Mahim. “I cycle every day from Andheri to South Mumbai. You need to dodge potholes and traffic, making it very risky,” tweeted a cyclist, Shane Albuquerque. Last week, the BMC had claimed that in the past five months (up to September 11), it had filled 33,156 potholes. Vinod Mishra, BJP’s group leader in the BMC, said Rs 350 crore had been spent on filling potholes, but all crucial roads in the city have potholes. “BMC data is a farce. There are at least 100 potholes on every arterial road, and let’s not even talk about the smaller roads in residential areas. Public money is going down potholes along with harassed commuters,” Mishra said. The BMC maintains 2,000-km of roads in the city while the remaining stretches are looked after by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority. BMC officials said several roads on which potholes have developed belong to other agencies like the MMRDA, MSRDC or are facing Metro construction. Officials said from now on, all roads wider than six metres will be cement concretised which will ensure there are fewer potholes. “We will reconstruct all roads wider than six metres in a phased manner with cement concrete instead of asphalt. This will ensure even minor roads are pothole-free,” said a BMC official. The BMC on Monday said they had formed 24 ward wise teams to fill up potholes. “Potholes will be filled up by the ward level teams in coordination with the roads department,” said the BMC.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Smart way out of Karol Bagh mess?||NEW DELHI: To establish a systematic and integrated parking system in Karol Bagh, North Delhi Municipal Corporation plans to develop a user-friendly and smart IT-enabled parking system with a mobile application. Currently, such a system is available only in New Delhi Municipal Council areas. The project will be part of the parking area management plan for Karol Bagh, which was drafted in 2020 after Ajmal Khan Road was pedestrianised in May 2019. It involves design, development, implementation, operation and maintenance of parking lots through a single concessionaire, unlike current multiple players. “Often there have been complaints of mismanagement such as parking beyond permissible limits and haphazard parking. To avoid such problems and reduce congestion, we want to allocate all sites to one concessionaire,” said Sanjay Goel, commissioner of the north corporation. The service provider will initially be appointed for five years, which may be extended for another two years. Various sites in Karol Bagh, including four multilevel parking lots, can accommodate 2,380 cars. Last week, the corporation conducted a joint field survey with Indian Railway Station Development Corporation (IRSDC), said an official. “If IRSDC agrees and we get approval from the deliberative wing, it will also develop facilities on Ajmal Khan Road and peripheral roads. We are also coordinating with residents welfare associations for provision of one parking per household,” Goel added. The corporation has placed a request for proposal (RFP) before the standing committee. “We are trying to engage a government organisation or a PSU for the project after the House approval. Otherwise, we will invite tenders,” said an official. The project will include marking parking/non-parking areas, installing smart equipment with handheld devices, boom barriers, RFID and parking management of four- and two-wheelers, trucks, public transport and pick-up vehicles. The proposal also covers real-time monitoring through CCTV cameras, update of entries and exits, checking availability of slots through the app, and flexibility of tariff for peak and non-peak hours. “Data will be transferred to a central control room and will be analysed for understanding consumer behaviour and parking demand and supply,” said an official. For cars, the corporation has proposed an on-street fee of Rs 40 for the first hour and a 50% increase after every half an hour, and Rs 20 per hour and then an hourly increase for off-street facilities. For two-wheelers, the rates are Rs 20 per hour on-street and Rs 10 per hour off-street. The proposal also includes towing charges for violation — Rs 1,000 for four- and three-wheelers, Rs 500 for two-wheelers and Rs 2,000 for buses, trucks and matadors. “The project will allow the concessionaire to lift vehicles parked at no-parking zones and the challan amount will be shared in a certain proportion,” said Himanshu Gupta, deputy commissioner of the Karol Bagh zone.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/smart-way-out-of-karol-bagh-mess/articleshow/86180748.cms||Vibha Sharma

---||Kochi||Corp to conduct survey in five wards||Thiruvananthapuram: The city corporation is set to undertake an elaborate survey in five wards covering 12,546 houses in Kovalam-Vizhinjam area as part of compiling data on unauthorized constructions and houses without building numbers. The decision was made in a meeting convened in the chamber of local self-government department (LSGD) minister in August. It was decided in the meeting that the civic body shall collect data on residents with ‘pattaya’ land, buildings which can be regularized and other factors. The civic body was asked to compile the data within 60 days. It has been reported that 12,546 buildings in five wards under the Vizhinjam-Kovalam area spread across 1,155 hectares. The objective is to identify constructions without building numbers and if eligible for tax deduction, tax can be collected and with building numbers being issued to houses, owners can avail various benefits of the state government as well. The corporation has estimated an amount of Rs 20 lakh to be required for the survey. Buildings in Vizhinjam-Kovalam area have always been a knotty affair for the civic body. Earlier, the engineering wing had undertaken efforts to identify unauthorized constructions in the area. However, the corporation’s attempts at demolition and regularization often got tangled in legal tussle. In the process, the civic body had ended up losing huge amount of tax from non-residential buildings in the area. In 2019, the corporation had geared up for a major demolition drive at Vizhinjam as per the directive of LSGD. The officials had finalized a list of 17 buildings which had to be demolished in the first phase. A total of 169 buildings were identified as unauthorized in the Vizhinjam-Kovalam area. LSGD had convened a meeting on December 21, 2018, to assess the action taken on report submitted by vigilance pertaining to constructions that were built in violation of coastal regulation zone (CRZ) norms in Kovalam-Vizhinjam area. In 2014, the corporation had planned a demolition drive at Vizhinjam. After a strenuous process of identification of illegal constructions and processing of documents that spanned six months, the corporation had issued confirmation order for demolition of 15 buildings at Vizhinjam. The committee appointed by the state had identified 34 buildings as unauthorized at Vizhinjam in November 2013. The buildings were deemed as unauthorized as the constructions were made in violation of CRZ norms. During the processing of legal files, the civic body officials had found out that none of the owners could prove that the buildings were made before 1991, when CRZ norms came into effect. This finding had ruled out chances for owners to file for regularization of their constructions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/corp-to-conduct-survey-in-five-wards/articleshow/86178354.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Agra||Agra: No highrise, mobile tower near Taj Mahal, skyline to be clear||AGRA: Highrises and mobile towers can no longer be built in a 1.5-km radius behind the Taj Mahal to keep the skyline unobstructed. The Agra administration has incorporated the provision in the city’s master plan, which the government has to now approve. “No construction higher than 25m can come up behind the Taj Mahal so the panoramic view of the monument is visible without an obstruction in the background,” Dr Rajendra Pensiya, vice chairperson of the Agra Development Authority, told TOI. “The decision was taken in a recent board meeting after a survey in March last year by the ADA engineering team,” said Amit Gupta, divisional commissioner, Agra, who is the ADA chairperson. The body had received several complaints about impeded views of the monument. Four towers, about 50-60m high, were visible behind the Taj — three on the west side and one on the east. “One of these mobile towers was demolished. The height of two others was reduced to 25m. One high-tension electric pole remains on the east side. We are in the process of moving it, but it will take time,” Pensiya said. There is just one highrise, by which they mean a building taller than four floors, in the backdrop. The administration is also considering the trees in the background as obstruction. “There are several old trees which are 50m high but cutting them is not possible because they fall under the Taj Trapezium Zone (a buffer area marked out to save the monument from pollution). To cut trees under the zone, we need permission from the Supreme Court,” said Pensiya. In 2013, a four-day convention of Unesco experts on visual integrity was held in Agra. “The ASI is bound to ensure the visual integrity mandate of Unesco sites, including the Taj Mahal, followed by the 2013 convention,” Rajiv Saxena, vice president of the Tourism Guild Agra, said. Former Agra circle senior conservation assistant Munazzar Ali told TOI that ASI norms stipulate a ban on construction in a 100-m radius around monuments and a 15-m height cap for construction in a 300-m radius. ASI superintending archaeologist (Agra circle) Vasant Swarnkar said it was a long-pending discussion about the view of the monument. “This is a welcome step."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/no-highrise-mobile-tower-near-taj-mahal-skyline-to-be-clear/articleshow/86175476.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

He said this after a meeting on Monday to take stock of the progress made on the matter and to endorse an increase in the adoption of RWH structures to efficiently use rainwater in a water-deficient Delhi. Jain, who is also chairman of Delhi Jal Board, said people could now get certification for RWH installation from an architect registered with the Council of Architecture instead of solely from DJB.  The state government will also provide financial assistance up to Rs 50,000 and a rebate of 10% in water bills to incentivise the installation of RWH systems. Among the measures being incorporated by DJB is the Dungarpur model, also known as inline RWH system. This model is cost effective and is currently being implemented in the tribal-dominated Dungarpur district of Rajasthan.  “It uses innovative techniques and is centred on routing the rainwater directly to a bore well, instead of a regular rainwater-harvesting pit,” explained Jain. This is achieved by the rainwater getting filtered within a pipe, avoiding an additional filter system and harvesting pits. The inline RWH system comprises a pipe with a geotextile membrane filter installed horizontally in the rainwater channel, which is connected to non-functional or defunct bore wells. Jain claimed that in comparison with a conventional RWH system, the Dungarpur one was cheaper. “This system is cost-effective because it does not require a complex setup. While setting up a conventional RWH system costs Rs 75,000-1 lakh, the Dungarpur model can be set up for as little as Rs 16,000,” he added. As for the relaxed compliance guidelines, Jain said people no longer needed to visit DJB’s office for a certificate. Their RWH structures could be certified by architects registered with the Council of Architecture provided the system was installed as per DJB guidelines. “This will save people a lot of time,” said the minister. DJB has 12 rain centres or Jal Shakti Kendras in each district in the capital to provide consumers with technical assistance for RWH installation. The guidelines for installing the RWH system as well as the list of rain centres can be obtained from DJB’s website ( delhijalboard.nic.in/content/rain-water-harvestingground-water-management). The Aam Aadmi Party government will give financial assistance of 50% of the cost of the RWH system, subject to a maximum of Rs 50,000 as well as a rebate of 10% in water bills. To avail these benefits, people must have an adequacy certificate for the RWH system. It is mandatory for new and existing properties covering over 100 sq m to adopt rainwater harvesting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/youve-till-dec-31-to-install-rwh-system-at-your-home/articleshow/86180754.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

As per the LSGD order, if the registrar feels that the couple who are married and living together for many years and are unable to present themselves before the local body registrar for registration purpose, modern facilities like video conferencing can be used for online registration with special permission from chief registrar general. Online registration can be done till the existing rules dated 2008 (The Kerala Registration of Marriages (Common) Rules) are amended. The order was issued based on a bevy of requests from couples, mostly residing abroad, seeking permission to register marriages online. Chief registrar general, after considering such petitions recently, submitted a report to the department citing that many couples produced court orders directing local bodies to register marriages online. The orders were obtained by couples who got married and left for abroad without registering marriages in respective local bodies. Many registrars have been registering marriages without demanding the physical presence of couple based on court orders, the chief registrar general cited in the report. In many countries, foreign travel is restricted due to Covid-19 and marriage certificate is demanded as a valid document for residence and employment needs. The registrar general in his report recommended that marriages can be registered online till December 31, 2021. In 2020, LSGD had issued an order relaxing the need for physical presence in case of an applicant who had to register marriage in Trivandrum corporation. They required to produce marriage certificate for getting permanent resident visa and owing to Covid situation they were unable to return to Trivandrum for registration process. Considering the circumstance, LSGD relaxed the norms and directed officials concerned to make use of video conferencing to ensure the veracity of occurrence of marriage and identities of the couple.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/civic-body-offers-e-regn-of-marriages/articleshow/86178404.cms||Aswin J Kumar

Babita said that she fell in trap and convinced Juli, who had taken admission in BDS at BHU after qualifying NEET two years ago, to appear in the exam. Babita said that she had received Rs 50,000 in advance. The CP said that the arrested woman and her daughter have divulged that the solvers’ gang is run by its mastermind known as PK from Patna. They also informed that PK rarely used phones and preferred to communicate through courier and travel by trains only. “After PK gets contracts from aspirants, his accomplices arrange the solvers,” said CP, mentioning that more details about the gang are being made.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/neet-solvers-gang-busted-woman-daughter-arrested/articleshow/86181989.cms||---

The existing Tilak bridge, built above railway tracks at Dadar, was built in 1925. Once the new bridge is ready, the old Tilak bridge will be razed and another two-lane bridge will come up in its place. At present, railway authorities are taking off the excess load from the pavement of the bridge to make it safe. This is being done as per recommendation of experts from IIT-B. MRIDC has approved plans to build a 650 m long bridge at a cost of Rs 375 crore. The two-lane bridge will be constructed without demolishing the existing Tilak bridge, thus ensuring that traffic movement is not hit for those using the east-west link. Maharail’s managing director Rajesh Kumar Jaiswal said, “We’ve begun shifting underground utilities in the way of alignment of the bridge.” —Manthan K Mehta||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-work-begins-on-new-flyover-set-to-replace-tilak-bridge/articleshow/86183209.cms||Manthank Mehta

However, no death has been reported due to dengue in the city till now. According to a report prepared by the South Delhi Municipal Corporation — the nodal agency that tabulates data on vector-borne diseases in the national capital, 11 cases of malaria and eight cases of chikungunya were recorded last week. The total number of malaria and chikungunya cases this year has reached 68 and 40, respectively.  Till September 11 last year, 114 cases of malaria and 47 of chikungunya were reported. Cases of vector-borne diseases are usually reported between July and November, but the period may stretch till mid-December.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||SOP for graft probe against govt staff||T’puram: Centre has framed a standard operating procedure (SOP), to effectively implement the process involved in seeking prior approval from competent authority before enquiring against government officials, as per the amended section of Prevention of Corruption Act. Centre has written to all chief secretaries, including state chief secretary VP Joy to implement the SOP that lists out a detailed procedure for stage-wise processing of confidential information and the rank of police officers who should seek prior approval from the government to seek a probe against different categories of public servants. Officers in the ranks of DGP, ADGP, IG and DIG have been authorized to vet such applications for prior approval and forward them to government and appropriate authorities on the basis of the rank of the person against whom an investigation has been sought. In the case of Union ministers, MPs, CMs and state cabinet ministers, MLAs, Supreme Court and high court judges CMDs of public sector enterprises or public sector banks, the application seeking prior approvals should be made only by an officer with the rank of DGP. In 2017, VACB had issued a circular, asking its officers to gather quality information on the basis of which a source information report about graft, misuse of official position and disproportionate assets should be prepared for seeking an enquiry. This was insisted after the agency had gone overboard in many cases which did not even have a vigilance probe angle and many government officials were being targeted for the actions they had taken in their official capacity. In 2018, Centre amended the PC Act, by inserting Section 17A that needs a prior approval if a probe is required against a public servant. In the latest SOP, a police officer, upon receipt of such information, should verify if the information prima facie reveals actual commission of an offence under the Act and contains information to identify the public servant(s) against whom the offence has been alleged. He must look into present status of such a public servant to determine the rank of appropriate polic officer to seek approval for conducting an enquiry under Section 17A of the Act if need arises and place the matter before the police officer of the appropriate rank for approval. The officer of appropriate rank then decides if the information received merits an enquiry. If the need is credible, he should submit a proposal to the government or appropriate authority through the single-window procedure with clear, authenticated documents. The government or the authority will have an officer – not below the rank of an under secretary – to receive proposals related to approval for enquiry or investigation under the section. The applications will have to be processed, cleared or declined within statutory timelines after adhering to mandatory procedures including examination and legal consultations, if required.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/sop-for-graft-probe-against-govt-staff/articleshow/86180902.cms||KP Saikiran

In several courses, there are no CBSE students this time since RBSE students scored much higher because of lenient marking. Due to pandemic, both the boards passed students on the basis of previous year’s marks without written examination. In Maharani College, the general cut-off was 99% for biology group subjects. The effect was CBSE students got admission only in OBC category while the rest of the seats were filled by RBSE students. In mathematics, RBSE students stole the show in general, OBC and EWS as the cut-off was 100%. In Maharaja College, only nine CBSE students got admitted in BSc honours and BCA subjects while the rest were from RBSE. The cut-off percentage for BCA in general category was 94.60%, while in the BSc category, the cut-off in physics and mathematics was 99%. A faculty from Maharaja College said, “Without any examination, students were given good marks, but there was not process to filter them at the admission level. The students who have been given inflated marks will not be able to cope with the pressure.” The fee has to be submitted between September 14 and 16 at the university college website by 11.59pm.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ru-2nd-cut-off-list-released-rbse-students-bag-90-seats/articleshow/86183180.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Extortion case: DCP says Maharashtra govt acted with ‘malice’||MUMBAI: The state government has acted against him “willfully without any reasonable or legal reason,” said Deputy Police Commissioner (DCP) (Crime) Akbar Pathan in his quashing petition before the Bombay high court on Monday. His counsel, Niteen Pradhan, submitted that the state is “obligated to act fairly without ill-will or malice in fact or in law.’’ When malice is attributed to the state, it is not a case of personal ill-will or spite by the state but rather the state is using the law for purposes other than what it intended, he submitted. Pathan has sought quashing of an extortion case registered against him earlier this year. The HC will hear the state’s special counsel Darius Khambata on September 21. Pradhan said it is clear that the legislature intends to treat public servants as a special class different from the private individual or common man, to protect them from “frivolous complaints”. He said the state’s act of filing the FIR against Pathan without any preliminary inquiry as mandated by law on a complaint from a person who has a “personal grudge’’ shows that the state functionaries have not acted diligently and fairly and hence he is a “victim of malice in law.’’ Pradhan’s submissions revolved around how the FIR was state’s “deliberate act in disregard to the rights’’ of Pathan. He said the FIR against Pathan does not disclose any prima facie case against him. He submitted before a bench of Justices S S Shinde and N J Jamadar that section 383 of the Indian Penal Code defines ‘extortion’ to mean intentionally putting the victim in fear of any injury to him or to any other person and dishonestly inducing the victim to part with property or money. When an ‘extortion’ by misuse of power is alleged against a public servant, it is an offence under sections 7 and 11 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, said Pradhan, adding that the police have “deliberately’’ not invoked the PCA in view of the protective procedures under section 17A of the Act –to take prior sanction before conducting any probe. The allegation in the FIR to the effect that Pathan threatened the informant to pay him Rs 50 lakh to prevent arrest, can never be said to be an act done by him in a private capacity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/extortion-case-dcp-says-state-acted-with-malice-in-mumbai/articleshow/86183212.cms||Swati Deshpande

Constructed at a cost of Rs 71 lakh, the butterfly park boasts of a walkway and a waterfall as its main attractions. The park also houses pagoda flowers, castor bushes and 30 varieties of nectar plants. The Natural History Society (NHS) has identified over 300 species of butterfly in Kerala. “We have around 120 species at the park at present. There are also some endangered species. You simply have to provide the right fauna and conditions for their habitat and it will naturally attract them,” said director of museum and zoos S Abu. In addition to the main butterfly park, the state government was also in the process of identifying schools across the state which had facilities and land to host butterfly parks of their own, he said. In this way the park would help promote the study and conservation of butterflies, which are essential pollinators of the ecosystem and whose habitats are threatened by urbanization. “The park here will be a study centre for school students to help them cultivate butterfly gardens in their own schools,” the director said. The park was developed and designed with the help of Travancore NHS members Kalesh Sadasivan and Baiju while the infrastructure was provided by the government. Despite the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, which had rendered the zoo and surroundings closed to the public, the museum and zoo staff were taking dedicated care of the area, said Abu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/butterfly-park-set-to-be-a-major-attraction/articleshow/86178479.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Following Covid-19 for the past two years, Gajapayana, the ceremonial march of elephants from the forests to Mysuru, ahead of their participation in Dasara has been held in a simple but traditional manner. The Dasara elephants - Gopalaswamy, Cauvery, Lakshmi, Dhananjaya, Chaitra, Vikrama and Ashwathama led by mighty tusker Abhimanyu, who will be carrying the Golden Howdah for the second time, were extended a traditional reception at Veeranahosahalli during Thula lagna at 9.50am.

Veterinarian Ramesh will monitor the health of the elephants during their stay in Mysuru. Later, the elephants were ferried in trucks to Mysuru. Around 2.30pm, the elephants reached Aranya Bhavan where they will stay till Wednesday (September 15). On Thursday, the elephants will be traditionally welcomed at the Mysuru Palace. The elephants will be made to get accustomed to urban environment and will also be given training and rehearse for the Dasara procession, which is scheduled on October 16. They will be trained in their Dasara duties inside the palace premises given that the Jamboree is restricted to the palace premises owing to the pandemic. DCF (Mysuru wildlife) V Karikalan said, “On September 16, the elephants will be shifted to Mysuru Palace premises. All the eight elephants are found healthy during the medical check-up conducted regularly from the past few days. The mahouts and kavadis are insured.” Karikalan said that tusker Ashwathama which was captured at Sakleshpura range in Hassan district in 2017 will be participating in Dasara for the first time. “The elephant will be trained to participate regularly in the coming Dasara festivities. While the mahouts and kavadis have been vaccinated with the first dose, those who have not got the second dose will be administered at Mysuru Palace premises,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/dasara-jumbos-accorded-traditional-welcome/articleshow/86175690.cms||---

Despite spending most of the money, only 11% of the waste has been processed and its volume has actually increased over the past two years, Bharadwaj claimed.“If the garbage is cleaned at this speed, even in 100 years, these mountains of garbage will not be removed. BJP is looting the money given by Delhi government in form of rent for trommel machines, which actually cost less than what they are being rented for,” he alleged. “According to a Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) report, damage of about Rs 500 crore is being caused to the environment from the three landfills,” said Bharadwaj.The landfill sites are located at Okhla in south Delhi, Bhalaswa in the north and Ghazipur in the east. “Delhi government gives Rs 65 crore while the east corporation contributes Rs 40 crore to clean up Ghazipur landfill; the Delhi government gives Rs 35 crore to clean Bhalaswa while the north corporation contributes Rs 30 crore; Delhi government gives Rs 25 crore to clean Okhla while the south corporation contributes Rs 15 crore. Overall, Delhi government is paying much more than the municipal corporations to clear these landfills,” Bharadwaj said.“These landfills were supposed to be reduced by 25% till now. Bhalswa had a deadline of April 2021, Okhla of October. A DPCC report states the work is going on slowly,” he alleged. The AAP functionary claimed that the slow progress was due to corruption. “They are eating up the Delhi government’s funds,” he alleged.No reaction was available from Delhi BJP against the allegations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/corpns-wasting-funds-received-from-delhi-landfill-work-slow-claims-aap/articleshow/86180855.cms||---

A total of 26 cases of murder, loot and other crimes were lodged against Verma, on whom police had announced a cash reward of Rs 1 lakh. Verma, who had been a sharpshooter of slain mafia don Prem Prakash alias Munna Bajrangi, was absconding since 2015. He was involved in several sensationonal murders, including double murder at Naini central jail gate in Prayagraj. According to STF, on getting inputs regarding the presence of Verma in Bariyasanpur village under Cholapur police station, the STF Varanasi field unit team led by deputy SP Shailesh Singh and Inspector Amit Srivastava cordoned the road leading to the village. When Verma along with one accomplice came out of the village on a motorcycle, he was surrounded by cops. He then opened indiscriminate fire on the policemen. The STF personnel returned the fire. Verma suffered bullet injuries and fell on the road while his accomplice managed to escape. Cops rushed a severely injured Verma to SPG divisional hospital where doctors declared him dead. Police recovered a pistol, a revolver, live cartridges and motorcycle from the spot. Regarding Verma’s criminal history, police said that a total of 26 criminal cases mostly of murder, loot and extortion were lodged against him with police stations of Varanasi and Prayagraj. A native of Ramapura Luxa area in Varanasi, Verma had become active in the crime world in 2011 and was sent to jail by police. After coming out of jail, he was absconding since 2015. “In 2015, Verma had dumped the body of Golu Yadav after killing him,” said police adding, “In the same year Verma murdered a corporator of Varanasi Municipal Corporation Shiv Seth while in 2016 his involvement had come to like in sensation double murder at Naini jail gate in Prayagraj.” Verma had initially joined the gang of Bajrangi’s sharpshooter Rayis Banarasi. After Rayis was killed in gang war, Verma associated with Bajrangi directly. After the killing of Bajrangi in Baghpat jail, Verma formed his own gang to run an extortion trade, targeting doctors and traders. None of his victims showed courage to lodge complaints against him with police due to his terror.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/dreaded-criminal-shotdead-by-stf-in-varanasi/articleshow/86182009.cms||---

Only giving particulars of yojanas (schemes) does nothing. There have been 40 deaths and 22 still births in one month,” said a bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish Kulkarni while hearing a clutch of PILs on malnutrition deaths in tribal areas of Maharashtra. Advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni said the state had filed three affidavits setting out details of steps taken. But the judges were informed by Melghat-based activist Bandu Sane that in August-September there were 40 deaths and 24 still births. He said despite the state’s claim that it is sending specialists, like paediatricians and genealogists, these doctors were not turning up. Sane also said the infant deaths are attributed to diarrhoea and pneumonia, and not malnutrition. “Why are these deaths happening? We have seen so many yojanas,” said the CJ. The judges took note from charts that urbans areas like Pune and Nagpur have 100% medical officers, and said they must be sent to areas with more tribal population. The AG said it is not that the state is not appointing doctors. “You may be appointing them but these doctors are not going there. Where is the record that they have attended to patients? How many have they treated?” asked the CJ. The AG also said whenever doctors are appointed, they are not ready to join their posts. “You have to give incentives for them to join,” the CJ said. The judges asked the petitioners to list immediate reliefs the state can provide to the tribal population. Posting the next hearing on October 6, they suggested that para volunteers visit households in these areas for assistance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bombay-hc-pulls-up-state-on-med-facilities-in-tribal-areas/articleshow/86183241.cms||Rosy Sequeira

Six teams of 100 forest staff stationed at different locations began the search operation on Sunday. They have also summoned camp elephants, Arjuna and Balarama, and installed around 70 camera traps to trace the animal.Ganesha, 22 , a tribal youth and a resident of Aianakere Haadi at Hanagodu Hobli near Veeranahosahalli forest range, was mauled to death by a tiger on Wednesday when he went to attend nature’s call near his house. With locals venting their ire, foresters rushed to the spot and placed a cage at the spot to catch the tiger.A forest officer told TOI that they have captured three tigers at different locations prowling in the camera traps.Of the three tigers, one had injuries on its back. “We suspect the tiger may have been injured in a territorial fight by another dominant male leaving it unable to hunt in the forest. This might have led the injured tiger to venture out of the forest and attack the youth. We are yet to confirm our suspicion,” the officer said.“We are ready with tranquilizers to dart the animal and on the direction from higher authorities will shift the animal to the rehabilitation centre,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/100-member-team-on-tiger-hunt/articleshow/86175648.cms||---

If someone is looking for any mode of commute, there are bicycles and scooters. If somebody wants to set up a home, the flea market offers fridge, television, coolers, old model pedestal fans, tea cups, glasses and as a topping, there are photo frames with printed paintings and toy vehicles for kids. Dresses, bags, earphones, helmets, mobile chargers, suitcases and shoes are also available. The three-day flea market, started on Saturday, is a joint venture of Vattiyoorkavu Youth brigade (Vybe), Youth Charitable Society, Green Army, and NGO Thanal. The idea of flea market was put forward by V K Prasanth MLA. “Some people’s useless items might be a valuable resource for those in need. It is preferable to reuse items such as plastics and electronics to prevent pollution. Plastics and e-waste dumped in ground might pollute the soil. This initiative aids us in reducing pollution. This venue was given to us for free and we intend to use it as a permanent flea market location. The items will be provided to the public at zero cost. We only accept materials in usable state and with minimal damage,” said one of the organizers. Dr T M Thomas Isaac, who inaugurated the flea market, has suggested that they keep a donation box which can help people donate items at any time. The team is also planning to launch an online platform. “We’re getting a lot of positive feedback both from donors and consumers. It’s wonderful to see how happy they are. Some customers may request certain items; if they are not available, we will notify once it is available. We are attempting to spread a positive mind set in society,” said Kiran Dev, a member of the organizing team. The market will be on till Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/three-day-flea-market-turns-out-to-be-a-big-hit/articleshow/86178452.cms||---

August figures too are higher than in the past, barring 2018, show statistics from the transport department. Experts say this could be an indicator of economic recovery and also increased use of personal vehicles during Covid. “The increase in vehicle registrations indicates a boost for the automobile sector in Maharashtra and also the banking sector with many opting for vehicle loans,” said minister of state (transport) Satej Patil. “Also, during the first Covid year (2020), people faced difficulties in travelling and so post-lockdown many have purchased bikes or cars. Some find travelling in personal vehicles such as bikes or scooters as the best form of social distancing,” said the minister. Data shows that in July 2021, there were 2,06,196 vehicle registrations collectively at 50 RTOs across Maharashtra. This was 105% more car, bike and other vehicular registrations as compared to July 2020. Moreover, July 2021 registrations were 25% more than in July 2019 (pre-Covid time). The figure is 5% and 9% more than in 2018 and 2017, respectively, an official said. The number of vehicles registered in August this year in the state was 47%, 14% and 5% more than in the month last year, 2019, and 2017. In Mumbai, vehicle registrations this July were 104% and 14% higher than in the same month in 2020 and 2019, respectively. But for August, 2021 registrations were 12% less than 2019 ones.  Nearly 55% of total registrations were of two-wheelers. Experts say motorcycles and scooters are a quick source of mobility, ensuring faster dispersal in traffic jams. A large number of owners are women and college students, said an official. Activist Anil Galgali said that though it was good to see an upswing in the automobile sector post Lockdown, there was also a need to control the growth of vehicles to ensure that city roads were not overcrowded. "We also need to keep a check on noise and air pollution besides ensuring that vehicles have ample space to park across the state," he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-registrations-of-vehicles-in-state-double-in-july-this-year-over-last/articleshow/86183281.cms||Somit Sen

The court added that setting law into motion on such an application against public servants would be nothing but causing “unnecessary harassment”.“There is no proof or even strong suspicion that any offence under the Prevention of Corruption Act or any other offence under IPC was committed,” it said in the order.The court added that except for making wild and bare allegations of general nature, the complainant has not put forth any specific incident regarding demand or acceptance of bribe by any public servant or commission of any other specific offence. “The entire allegations are based on conjectures and surmises and the application/complaint seems to be driven due to non-allocation of permanent vending site to the applicant and therefore personal vendetta… General allegations have been made that vending licences were issued after taking bribe. On such vague and wild allegations, no direction can be passed for registration of FIR,” it noted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/court-rejects-vendors-plea-against-cops-calls-it-vague/articleshow/86180889.cms||Usha Das

---||Noida||After missing 4 deadlines, Sec 71 underpass set to open by Sept 20||Noida: The Sector 71 underpass, which has missed four deadlines, is likely to be thrown open to traffic by September 20, officials said. The subsequent lockdowns and a clearance from Delhi Metro over a metro pillar around the underpass had delayed the project for long.Officials said most of the underpass had been laid, except for a 150-metre stretch whose top layering was left. Although work has been expedited so that the project sticks to its fifth deadline, rain and the subsequent effect on construction is a cause for concern, the officials admitted. The 780-metre, six lane underpass, which will cost an additional Rs 6.7 crore from its earlier budget of Rs 52 crore because of the delay, would ease traffic movement from Wave City Centre metro station towards the Parthala roundabout via Sector 52 and from sectors 72-79 towards Ghaziabad.“We normally cover 25 metres of a stretch in one day, but it can be increased with more labourers at work. At this rate, we expect the entire stretch to be ready in about 5-6 days. However, rain is a concern. Of late, heavy showers have affected work. Clearing the muck and starting the work takes time. The plan is to inaugurate the underpass between September 15 and 20,” said Mukesh Vaish, a senior manager at the Authority.The remaining 150-metre stretch already has three layers in place. The fourth and top layer is left to be laid. “On Sunday too, the underpass was flooded. Water was removed using a pump. We expedited the work on Monday, but it rained again in the afternoon. We are trying our best to complete the work in time,” said Vaish.The official claimed there would not be any flooding on the stretch once the underpass was ready. A heavy sump well has also been installed at the site to pump out water.The underpass had been a long pending demand of the residents of nearby sectors, such as 51, 52, 61, 62, the 7x and so on. The residents had been asking for a seamless access to the Parthala roundabout and the 7x sectors without having to take the elevated road.But it took a long time getting permission from DMRC for the metro pillar, around which the underpass is being built. In July, the commissioner of metro rail safety had given a go ahead to the Noida Authority to start work around the pillar. The Authority had been asked not to use any heavy machines or earthmovers around the metro pillar while finishing work on the remaining stretch.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/after-missing-4-deadlines-sec-71-underpass-set-to-open-by-sept-20/articleshow/86183237.cms||Meenakshi Sinha

He added that Rs 12 lakh will be required for each centre and will be funded by the UP government under provisions of the National Rural Health Mission.The official said the department will try to rent rooms that are close to the PHCs. “If that is not possible, we can add up a few rooms in the PHC itself,” he added. Singheshwar Tyagi, a resident of Sihani village, said, “Except for treatment of minor ailments, PHCs serve no other purpose. We ultimately have to rely on government or private hospitals. But if the PHCs are equipped in a manner that they provide better healthcare, it would save us a lot of inconvenience.”Tyagi added that the proposed maternity wards at the PHCs could be a “boon” for pregnant women in rural villages. “They require thorough check-ups from time to time. Going to a government hospital is cumbersome while visiting a private one is expensive,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/all-gzb-phcs-to-get-sub-centres-with-maternity-ward-vax-unit/articleshow/86183290.cms||---
---||Delhi||Builders haven't paid a paisa to clear dues, say Noida authorities||NEW DELHI: A year after Supreme Court directed Noida and Greater Noida authorities to cap the interest rate for delayed payments by builders at around 8% instead of charging an exorbitant 15-23%, the authorities on Monday told the court that real estate companies have deposited “not a single paisa” to clear their dues and sought recall of the order. Observing that there is a need to “give impetus” to the real estate sector and relief should be granted to builders as many of them were struggling to survive due to the slowdown in the economy and the Covid-19 pandemic, the apex court in June last year had said charging a reasonable rate of interest of around 8% would enable them to complete the housing projects and had passed the order to grant relief to real estate industry operating in NCR. However, home buyers will be affected if the dues are not paid. Some of the projects could already be in the IBC process while others would not be able to provide registration or occupancy certificates to home buyers as the authorities have not received payments from builders for lease, penalties and interest. Seeking recall of the order, advocate Ravindra Kumar told the bench that the order was passed without examining all issues. He said that the court was hearing Amrapali case and examining ways to protect homebuyers but the order passed was general in nature, applicable to all developers who were not even party in the case. As a bench of Justices U U Lalit and Ajay Rastogi raised the question on how can the order be recalled after one year as some of the builders might have availed the relief which could not be deprived to other companies, Kumar said that the entire thing had come to a standstill after June 10 order passed by court last year. “Not a single paisa has been paid in the last one year,” Kumar told the bench. The plea of the athorities was opposed by builders and senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for one of them, told the bench that recall application filed by Noida and Greater Noida was abuse of process of law. He said the authorities agreed to charge a low interest rate but later on changed their stand. He said that they waited for the judge (who dictated the order) to retire and then they filed an application seeking recall of the order. The court had passed the order on a plea of Ace Group of Companies which alleged that various projects are stalled and became dormant due to excessive lease rent, penalty and interest charged by the authorities. It had contended that SBI MCLR (Marginal Cost of Funds-based Lending Rate) rate of interest for three years is only 7-8%, and Noida authorities be directed to reduce the rate of interest. “Considering the current state of real estate and in order to give impetus to such housing projects and mainly considering the plight of home buyers and as pointed out by Noida and Greater Noida Authorities that of 114 plots allotted from 2005 onwards, most of the projects are incomplete, we direct that the rate of interest on the outstanding premium and other dues to be realised in all such cases be at the rate of 8% per annum and let the Noida and Greater Noida Authorities do a restructuring of the repayment schedule,” the court had said. The court, however, had made it clear that if the builders failed to clear the dues within reasonable time, the concession granted will be withdrawn.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/builders-have-not-paid-anything-after-interest-rate-cap/articleshow/86180989.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to an infection damages its own tissues. Drug resistance is caused when a patient does not take the doses as prescribed by the doctor and increase or decrease them on their own. At times, doctors also use antibiotics indiscriminately. Speaking in an awareness programme on Sunday, Prof Ved Prakash, head, pulmonary and critical care medicine, KGMU, said, “When a patient develops drug resistance, bacterial growth continues unabated, leading to sepsis. About 400 cases of sepsis come to our critical care unit in a year and among them 40% are due to drug resistance. Such cases have gradually increased over the years. In fact, experts worldover have projected that indiscriminate antibiotic usage will make sepsis a leading disease by 2050, surpassing cardiovascular diseases and cancer.” Prof Apul Goel of the urology department said, “The most common site of infection that leads to sepsis is the lungs, which contributes to around 35% of sepsis cases we get. It is followed by urinary tract infection which comprises around 25% of the cases. Other sources of sepsis are gut and skin infections.” Prof BNBM Prasad, pulmonary critical care medicine, said, “A close watch on antibiotic prescription is required to check its over or underuse.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/incorrect-use-of-antibioticsraises-sepsis-risk-experts/articleshow/86152288.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The priest, identified as 66-year-old Chandan Giri, has told police that one of his disciples gave the skin to him on Shivaratri and he used to meditate while sitting on the skin. Dinesh Joshi, range officer, Pithoragarh, told TOI, “The priest is a native of Darchula (Nepal) but has been living in the Pithoragarh temple for the past 35 years.” He added that the skin was seven-foot-long and the big cat was five years old when it died. Meanwhile, in another incident, forest personnel recovered a leopard skin from Khumti bridge at Dharchula on Saturday. Two accused — 40-year-old Aan Singh and 38-year-old Trilok Singh — were held in the matter and subsequently, booked under the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. The leopard skin recovered from them was 8-foot-long and the big cat was four years old when it died.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/temple-priest-66-held-with-leopard-skin/articleshow/86178565.cms||Prem Punetha
---||Mumbai||South Mumbai hotelier appeals 3-year jail for firing at sister, gets 10-year RI for attempt to murder||MUMBAI: The Bombay HC on Monday convicted hotelier Lalit D’Souza and sentenced him to 10 years’ rigorous imprisonment for an attempt to murder offence in 2007, when he fired six shots at his sister, Lorna, over a car parking dispute. The HC, in March 2012, while admitting Lalit’s appeal, had said that “considering the nature of offence and manner in which it was committed”, it found the three-year sentence by a trial court “grossly inadequate’’ and had issued him a notice on why his sentence should not be enhanced. A bench of Justices P B Varale and N R Borkar, in their judgment on Monday, said, “Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, we have no slightest doubt...that the intention of the accused was to kill (his sister). He is thus held guilty for the offence punishable under IPC Section 307 (attempt to murder).” After hearing Lalit’s counsel Sudeep Pasbola, additional public prosecutor Geeta Mulekar for the state and Ashok Bhatia for Lorna, the HC held, “Under Section 307, if hurt is cause, the penalty is up to life term. However, considering that the incident was not premeditated and it was 2007, in our view, the ends of justice would be met by directing the accused to suffer 10 years’ RI.” Mulekar said: “It would be travesty of justice if trial court order is allowed to stand.” She also argued that lack of premeditation by itself is not enough to attract an exception in law and his firing of six rounds showed that he had “acted in a cruel manner” with an intention to kill her. The HC agreed. “The accused had fired six gun shots at (his sister) who was unarmed and thus acted in cruel and unusual manner. The accused is, thus, not entitled to benefit of exception 4 to IPC Section 300,’’ it said. Lorna had said that the shots, fired between 3am and 3.30am, hit her on her chest and right hand and she fell, but Lalit didn’t stop firing at her. She was admitted at Bombay hospital for 19 days of which she was on the ventilator for 12. Lalit, who examined himself as his own defence witness, said he had fired “in self-defence” as his sister had “threatened” him using “the names of gangsters Suresh Bhandari and Bala Shetty” and had charged towards him with an iron rod. His counsel submitted that his father was also “shot at by extortionist”. Pasbola said Lalit shot to “save himself from impending danger”. Lalit claimed that he fired the first shot in the air, which the HC found “improbable” after seeing the medical evidence. The doctor had said she had two entry wounds on right arm, two on the chest, one on right breast and one “on middle of the back” and had perforated her abdomen. The HC granted him four weeks to surrender to serve his sentence. His conviction under IPC Section 326 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons) stands set aside. The HC maintained his acquittal under the Arms Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/hotelier-fired-6-shots-at-unarmed-sister-in-mumbai-hc/articleshow/86183335.cms||Swati Deshpande

In cis-Hindon areas, GMC has selected Kavinagar, Nahru Nagar, Patel Nagar and Vijaynagar.“Prolonged rain over the past few days has damaged several city roads, leading to waterlogging and consequent traffic jams at many places. In view of this, we have decided to embark on a project under which 75km of roads in the municipality area will be revamped,” said GMC chief Mahendra Singh Tanwar. The overhaul of roads would include road repairs, construction of the central verge, planting of trees and lighting. “We plan to start work after the rain subsides and work will be completed in three months before winter sets in. We have earmarked Rs 25 crore of the Rs 241 crore allocated to us,” said Tanwar.Road dust has emerged as a major source of pollution in the city and during winter, it gets more acute.“Last year, the UP Pollution Control Board carried out a survey of the city, in which Indirapuram’s CISF road was rated the worst polluted stretches in Ghaziabad. Based on that report, we have selected 17 spots in the city with maximum dust pollution,” the commissioner said.“We aim to use perforated tiles in these areas. Part of the work will also include planting plants on the central verge of the roads to control dust pollution,” he added.Santosh Singh, a resident of Indirapuram’s Ahmisa Khand 2, said, “It has been more than 18 months since the pothole-ridden roads in Ahisma Khand 2 have not been attended to. In the past, all we have received is empty promises. Hope this time around, the GMC will carry out repair work,” said Santosh Singh, a resident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/roads-damaged-by-rains-to-be-repaired-in-3-mths/articleshow/86183264.cms||Abhijay Jha
---||Kochi||Karuvannur Cooperative Bank: Four ex-board members arrested||THRISSUR: The crime branch team probing the fraud at the CPM-ruled Karuvannur Cooperative Bank on Monday arrested four former director board members, including former president K K Divakaran. The probe team identified the other three arrested persons as Chakrampulli Jose, Thaivalappil Byju and Vakkayil Veettil Lalithan. While Divakaran, Jose and Byju are CPM activists and local-level leaders, Lalithan is a CPI activist. However, CPM has expelled Divakaran from the party and has suspended Byju for six months. The party has not announced any action against Jose, so far. The CPI has also not announced any action against Lalithan. The probe team led by K S Sudarshan, crime branch SP, had earlier arrested five persons, including the bank secretary Sunilkumar. The total number of persons arrested has risen to nine. However, Kiran, who is suspected to be the key accused in the case, is yet to be arrested. The arrested people were the director board members since 2011. The crime branch team found that the financial fraud had started in the bank in 2011. Huge loans were sanctioned in the names of relatives of the arrested director board members, the SP said in a press release. The bank authorities granted loans to people staying outside the operational area by giving membership on fake addresses, and by inflating the price of the land submitted as surety. Multiple loans were sanctioned on the same property submitted as surety, and on land against which property attachment notices were issued, Sudarshan said. There were altogether 13 members on the dissolved director board; among them, former vice-president T R Bharathan has died. The probe team had listed all the remaining 12 members of the director board, apart from the office staff, as accused in the fraud estimated to be Rs 100 crore. The charge against the director board members is that they connived with office staff in illegally sanctioning loans and siphoning off bank funds. The probe team indicated that the remaining eight director board members are also likely to be arrested soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/four-ex-board-members-arrested/articleshow/86180973.cms||---

Vehicles on NH-8 travelling between these two cities will now be able to charge their electric vehicles within 40 minutes. Each charging station is of 60 kilowatt capacity and has fast-charging capabilities. Gujarat currently has some 1,319 e-vehicles. The Centre has sanctioned 278 electric vehicle charging stations in three cities of Gujarat including Ahmedabad, Vadodara and Gandhinagar under the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles, India scheme phase-II (FAME-II). Most of these sanctioned EV charging stations are yet to be operationalized for public. “Two more stations will soon be commissioned in Ahmedabad near Premchandnagar, Satellite area. Currently, the eight stations include two at the Mumbai airport and two each at three locations along the National Highway 8 – one between Bhilad and Vapi; one between Surat and Navsari and one between Vadodara and Bharuch,” said Kartikey Hariyani, founder and CEO of the startup, which has already set up some 260 charging stations and 950 charging points for electric vehicles across India.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/8-charging-stations-set-up-on-nh-8/articleshow/86180945.cms||---

It should also allocate more funds for mental health care as more people are suffering from mental illness. A division bench of justice N Kirubakaran (since retired after signing the order) and justice B Pugalendhi observed that the World Health Organization calls India the most depressed country in the world. Hence, it is the duty of the Centre along with all state governments to have a comprehensive action plan to identify patients with mental illness and provide appropriate treatment. A periodical survey should be conducted for this purpose, the court said. Since there is an acute shortage of psychiatrists and child psychiatrists in the country, the judges said all medical colleges should have a department of psychiatry with a postgraduate course. “The concept of having only mental hospitals to provide psychiatric care is an outdated one. Now, it is believed that a majority of persons with mental illnesses can be managed in the community or through outpatient care,” the judges said while calling for efforts to have a psychiatrist in all taluk headquarters hospitals. The court passed the order while disposing of a PIL filed by KR Raja of Madurai who sought a direction to establish an exclusive medical wing in the central prison either in Trichy or Madurai to provide mental health care to prisoners with adequate staff.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/set-up-mental-health-institutes-allocate-more-funds-madras-hc-tells-centre/articleshow/86186025.cms||---

The forest department has also got reports of the movement of a leopard with cub. “We have found a couple of pugmarks towards Bavla and it appears that the leopard could have come from Chotila,” said R Sakkira Begum, deputy conservator of forest, Ahmedabad. She said farmers have told foresters of having sighted a leopard with a cub. The forest department stated that a leopard which had been found dead on the highway near Sanathal in an earlier case, may also have come from Chotila. Forest officials involved in tracing the leopard after the current sighting said that some farmers from the area have claimed they had seen a cub with the adult leopard. This was seconded by forest department officials who had earlier stated that they do not rule out the possibility of a second leopard too, as differences were found in the pug impressions at the site. Foresters said that they are scanning nearly 10 sq km area near Bavla to trace the leopard, and believe the leopard came from Chotila, as that area has a leopard population. A senior officer said that in the February incident too, when the officials had tracked the leopard, they had found some trails toward Bavla. This meant the leopard came to the city outskirts from Chotila which is about 180km away from Ahmedabad. Foresters said that since Wednesday night, when it was first sighted and had hunted a Nilgai calf, the leopard has not been sighted again. The forest department has even used a drone to scan the area but could not find any traces of the feline.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/leopard-trail-leads-to-chotila/articleshow/86180994.cms||---
---||Noida||Greater Noida: Garbage picked up? A QR code will inform you||GREATER NOIDA: The Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority (GNIDA) is banking on technology to improve its doorstep collection of waste. Officials said the company that would be chosen through bids for the waste collection process would have to paste QR codes outside each house. The codes will be scanned by the worker who will come to collect the waste and register his presence with the company. This will help the private vendor compile its monthly report on whether waste has been collected from the doorstep on all days. The report will then be sent to the GNIDA. This apart, the vehicles carrying the garbage from households would be fitted with GPS devices so that their movement can be tracked. The waste treatment plants would also be fitted with CCTV cameras so that the processing of the garbage can be monitored. The GNIDA is planning to mention on its complaints window the names and contact details of employees engaged in collection of waste. “We would incorporate several changes to the ways waste would be collected from households in Greater Noida. We will use technology to monitor the entire process. QR codes will be pasted outside each and every house, even in villages where waste is supposed to be collected from the doorstep. Also, every vehicle engaged in carrying garbage will be connected with GPS devices. CCTV cameras will also monitor the work in real time,” said Narendra Bhooshan, the GNIDA CEO. Officials said the residents could also use the Mitra app of GNIDA to raise complaints if waste was not collected from their doorstep. The authority will spend Rs 123.4 crore on the waste collection project. The company that would be hired through tenders would be engaged for the next 10 years. The last date for receiving the applications is September 28. Greater Noida generates about 200 tonnes of garbage every day. It is expected to increase in the future as more sectors will be included in the doorstep waste collection process. Bulk waste generators — 100kg or more — such as multi-storey residential buildings, industries, malls, hospitals, etc. will have to dispose of their own waste. However, the GNIDA’s vendor will collect non-recyclable waste from them at a fixed price..||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/garbage-picked-up-a-qr-code-will-inform-you/articleshow/86183325.cms||Meenakshi Sinha

Police deployed divers to rescue the children with the help of locals. Police identified the children as Manu (13) and her cousin Ankit Kumar (12), residents of Atsalia village, who went into the river for a holy dip after completing a ‘havan’ at a temple in their village. The children were accompanied by their parents and nearly 20 people from their village, but they couldn’t do anything to save them. Manu’s father even dived into the river to rescue the children, but his effort proved insufficient. The bodies couldn’t be found till the time of filing this copy.

Patil, on Monday, took a review meeting of the safety of motorists using both stretches of the highway. “The Save Life Foundation (SLF) was given the task to carry out the safety audit of the highway stretches. According to the findings, as many as 298 people lost their lives on the said roads between 2019-20,” Patil said. “We initiated the safety audit to check the gravity of the situation. Lot of young lives have been lost due to various reasons. The forum working for safe commuting has suggested several infrastructural and policy-related measures. First I have asked the SPs of all the districts to start 24x7 patrolling along the national highway. The patrolling should be done by forming dedicated team of staff and they should be provided with vehicle for carrying out the task. Also, the authorities have been asked to look into the suggestions made by the SLF and form a plan of action to be adopted to make the highway safe for all types of commuting,” he added. Motorists, while driving on the highway, tend to violate the rules. They often drive on the wrong side, use wrong lanes, do not wear helmets, overtake recklessly, among others. "We are going to use more information technology tools for monitoring the road safety conditions. Relevant infrastructure will be created for effective use of IT," said Patil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/start-24x7-patrolling-along-nh-48-satej-patil-tells-sps-of-4-districts/articleshow/86175863.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Over 2k trees to be axed to widen road, allow faster travel to Mussoorie||DEHRADUN: At least 2,200 trees have been earmarked to be felled to widen a two-lane 14-km-long road which will enable faster access to Mussoorie from Delhi. The Jogiwala-Ladpur-Sahastradhara crossing-Krishali Square-Pacific Golf Estate stretch — which has thousands of eucalyptus, mango and peepal trees — will enable tourists coming from Delhi to proceed straight to Mussoorie without entering Dehradun’s Rajpur Road. This will also help decongest the state capital which witnesses severe jams during peak tourist seasons. The project has approval from the Centre and funds of Rs 77 crore have been sanctioned under the Central Roads Fund (CRF), a Public Works Department official told TOI. The two-lane stretch will be converted into a four-lane stretch with a minimum of 10m to 14m wide blacktop throughout the road. The official told TOI that 2,200 trees have been earmarked for felling on the stretch and the state government would come out with its notification soon following which a tender will be floated for the road widening project. “The road will keep tourists going to Mussoorie away from Dehradun. A majority of the trees to be felled are eucalyptus and have already crossed their maturity age. These trees are coming in the right-of-way along with the road, telephone and electricity lines which are also to be shifted,” said Dhirender Kumar, executive engineer, Rishikesh PWD division. Residents, however, have started an online petition to stop tree felling. The petition, addressed to the ministry of forest and environment as well as Uttarakhand CM Pushkar Singh Dhami, spearheaded by not-for-profit ‘The Earth and Climate Initiative’ has urged officials to not go ahead with tree felling since it will “spell further doom for Dehradun’s ecology”. TOI had earlier reported that since the state’s formation, Dehradun has lost the maximum forest cover among all 13 districts. Divisional forest officer of Mussoorie, Kahkashan Naseem, said an alternate plan will be sought to save the trees. “Perhaps, we can ask the nodal agency of the project to spare trees like Tun and Amaltas,” Naseem said. Himanshu Arora, secretary of ‘Citizens for Green Doon’, a social organisation, said Dehradun has been facing water woes and human-wildlife conflict due to rapid concretisation. “Rapid urbanisation is hampering groundwater recharging. The city will soon turn into dry cities like Ghaziabad and Noida. The valley is being turned into flat land in the name of development which is not its actual geographical state,” he said. The residents have warned to start a Chipko movement if the state government doesn't abolish its plan to fell trees on the lines of their protest against expansion of Jolly Grant Airport.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/over-2k-trees-to-be-axed-to-widen-road-allow-faster-travel-to-mussoorie/articleshow/86178583.cms||Shivani Azad
---||Goa||Big players want to play big games, top competitions, says Arsene Wenger||Panaji: The first slide of Arsene Wenger’s presentation to the media had Kylian Mbappe and Toni Kroos complaining about the number of matches professional footballers play in a season. “We’ve had a marathon of games,” complained Mbappe, France and PSG star, the most sought-after footballer at the moment. “In football, we could do with more time to rest,” said Real Madrid midfielder Kroos. Even FIFPRO general secretary Jonas Baer Hoffmann agreed with the former Arsenal manager who, as Fifa’s head of global development, is on a mission to re-draw the international calendar. While European players complain of too many matches, in India there are too few. The Indian Super League (ISL) has 11 teams which means just 20 matches in a season for most players. Those in the second-tier I-League play even fewer. So, is there an ideal number of matches for footballers anywhere in the world? “There is no ideal number because recovery and physical potential is different,” Wenger told TOI during the online media interaction. “I feel that is left to the scientists at the clubs. Players normally get the first sign of fatigue where doctors alert the manager that players need rest. There is a massive turnover now at all clubs because scientists are there to protect the players.” Fifa is holding a feasibility study into shortening the gap between the World Cups from four to two years, following a request from the Saudi Arabian federation which was approved by 166 national associations. Wenger is leading the study and, along with several former stars which includes Ronaldo, a two-time World Cup winner and three-time finalist with Brazil, is convinced that the need of the hour is quality, rather than quantity. “I have been long enough in the job to know what the big players want,” the former Arsenal manager said. “The big players want to play big games and every football player in the world dreams to play top competitions.” Wenger believes the current international window – with five breaks in a year – is outdated. He has instead proposed two international windows in March and October, which will guarantee more meaningful games, less travel for players and, with fewer international breaks, guaranteed rest. “From the studies that we have, repeated travelling and climate difference are more detrimental than the number of games played. That’s what we want absolutely to reduce. We will not increase the number of games. We might even reduce the qualifiers and regroup the qualifiers,” said Wenger. While Wenger’s plan to double the number of World Cups by holding the tournament every two years from 2028 has found support in the likes of Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola, UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin has warned of a potential European and South American boycott, if the plans come to fruition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/big-players-want-to-play-big-games-top-competitions-says-arsene-wenger/articleshow/86212340.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

Police said articles to the tune of Rs 16.50 lakh have been seized during the raid. “Despite being illegal, the bullfight was being held at Peerkalyan village on a government owned grazing land. Soon after the police team reached the spot, the suspects along with their bulls fled in the neighbouring jungles. Following a brief chase, police nabbed the four suspects — Shakh Chingya, Shaikh Chandbhai, Syed Mujeeb, and Kishor Kadam,” a police officer said. “The suspects have been booked on charge of disobeying orders duly promulgated by the authorities and for unlawfully or negligently doing an act which is likely to spread the infection of any disease dangerous to life. In addition to this they have also been slapped with sections of prevention of cruelty to animals Act, 1960,” he added. Inspector Maruti Khedkar said the suspects had organized the event as part of their annual affair and the locals also informed that they were placing bets on the bull fight. “We have seized four tempos that were used for transporting the bulls and two cars belonging to the suspects,” he said. An officer privy to the action said they were also considering to seize the bulls, but they were too aggressive to be seized. As a result, the animals were handed over to the civic authorities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/jalna-four-booked-for-organising-illegal-bullfight-placing-bets/articleshow/86175931.cms||---

The EV charging plaza will be completed within a month. “We are moving closer to our agenda of developing innovative charging infrastructure and EV ecosystem in the national capital and we are happy to be collaborating with Convergence Energy Services Limited (CESL), who comes with an expertise in EVs and charging infrastructure in the country,” Gahlot said. “We are also in the process of deliberation on adding 20 more sites of the transport department in the next phase of installation apart from the 100 public charging stations which will be installed through the open tender. This will significantly ease the transition towards e-mobility for public transport and subsequently for the residents of Delhi,” he said, adding that since the launch of Delhi’s EV policy last year, there has been a significant rise in the number of these vehicles, with more than 17,000 EVs registered. CESL, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Energy Efficiency Services Limited, ministry of power, will develop public EV charging and battery swapping stations at seven DTC terminals and depots in Delhi, in collaboration with the corporation. Each of the seven locations will have a total of six charging points, three of which will be for two and three-wheelers and three points which can charge four-wheelers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/charging-plaza-at-nehru-place-for-evs-to-be-ready-in-a-month/articleshow/86181063.cms||---

Teltumbde, 70, is accused of links with Maoists, and has been booked under the anti-terror law — Unlawful Acivities (prevention) Act. Teltumbde has appealed against an earlier order passed by the special NIA court denying him bail. Teltumbde’s counsel Mihir Desai contends that the trial court has erred in not considering his lack of association with the Elgar Parishad and also that there was no other evidence to link him with any outlawed Maoiststs’ group.tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/teltumbde-bail-nia-gets-3-weeks-to-reply-in-mumbai/articleshow/86183368.cms||---

The incident took place in the Saura-Saroli area of Maldevta on Sunday. Identified as one Shahbaaz, the man and his friends reportedly went near a forest where they came across a herd of elephants, according to the forest staff. Seeing the jumbos, they started to flee, but Shahbaaz was attacked by one of the elephants and suffered grievous injuries. He was taken to a health centre where he was declared dead. The incident has raised questions on the lack of patrolling in the forest area despite it being a famous jumbo zone and rising cases of elephants moving around that area. The forest department data indicates that eight persons have lost their lives to human-elephant conflict and five others were left brutally injured in Uttarakhand till July 31. And almost a dozen elephants have also lost their lives in different forms of conflicts arising due to encroachment of their habitats. A few residents of Dehradun have alleged that it is "excessive encroachment of fringe forest areas due to which the elephants are unwillingly getting into a conflict". Incidentally, the mishap occurred close to Balawala forest where the education department had planned to come up with a science research institute by felling at least 25,000 trees. In the same area, the previous year, solar fencing was raised to keep elephants away from venturing out from the forest in search of food.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/elephant-tramples-to-death-man-out-on-picnic-with-friends-near-dehradun/articleshow/86178676.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Ganesh mandals & anti-superstition organizations step up awareness campaign against black magic||Nagpur/ Chandrapur: Chandrapur police had played a key role in being the driving force behind stepping up an anti-superstition campaign using the platform of Ganesh festivities in the backdrop of four incidents of violence targeting the so-called black magic practitioners at different places.Following motivation from the police department, some Ganesh mandals in Gondpimpri taluka have set an example by putting up banners regarding anti-superstition law and related activities like black magic.Lomesh Bhoyar of Yuva Adarsh Sarbojanin Ganesh Mandal said their association aims to create awareness through banners and posters against superstitions and godmen who prompt victims to spend substantially or engage in absurd harmful activities. “Initially, our efforts were taken very lightly by citizens but later they realized the importance of our anti-superstition campaign and started paying heed to messages conveyed through banners,” he said, adding, an important aspect of the message was to convince masses against violence to deal with superstitions.Assistant PI Sushil Dhokte of Dabha police station said at least six different places have such interesting anti-superstition banners put up by Ganesh mandals. “The banners have also highlighted the penal provisions of the anti-superstition act of 2013 where it’s mentioned that fines between Rs 5,000 and Rs 50,000 could be slapped on practitioners of black magic and related activities,” he said, adding, SP Arvind Salve and SDPO Raja Pawar had appealed the Ganesha mandals at a meeting at Rajura and Gadchandur to shoulder the responsibility of anti-superstition campaigns in the backdrop of six incidents of violence against such trends in the society.Office bearers of Andhashraddha Nirmulan Samiti (ANIS) went to all the places where violence had taken place and held awareness programmes with the help of cops to enlighten people about superstitions and guided them about the related law. “Cops have taken proactive measures in two places on the Telangana border, where they had intelligence inputs that such incidents could happen. We held a programme at the village Kavit Peth and Saknoor on the Telangana border and explained to the people about the falsehood of witchcraft and back magic. People were convinced and no incident took place there,” said Anil Dahagaonkar, district organizer of ANIS.Dahagaonkar claimed that they have held more than 15 programmes at different places, including villages where the incident took place, to guide and enlighten people about the Anti-Back Magic Act. Chandrapur Social Front, a social organization, stepped up and held a big awareness programme for intellectuals, activists, social workers and media persons in Chandrapur city. “We have been approaching Ganesh mandals to take up the issue of superstition and create awareness among people about the Anti-Back Magic Act at their pandals. While the police department has eagerly supported the cause, the social justice department, which shoulders the responsibility of creating awareness to deter such incidents, is sombre,” he charged.Dhagaonkar said the Act came into force in 2013 and a GR was passed the following year for creation of the Planning Implementation and Monitoring Committees (PIMC) at the district level. This committee has the additional collector, additional SP and activists involved in work against back magic and superstition. A similar committee needs to be instituted at the taluka and village level to implement the Anti-Black Magic Law. However, even after seven years of the enactment of the law, not a single PIMC has been created. Dhagaonkar claimed that they have submitted a letter to the collector asking him to immediately institute these committees in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ganesh-mandals-anti-superstition-organizations-step-up-awareness-campaign-against-black-magic/articleshow/86178630.cms||Mazhar Ali
---||Noida||Team of CBRI experts visits twin towers for inspection||Noida: The director of the Central Building Research Institute (CBRI) visited the Supertech Emerald Court project on Monday morning along with a group of experts and Noida Authority officials. The team from the Roorkee-based institute inspected the twin towers in the project, whose demolition has been ordered by the Supreme Court in three months.The group of experts spent more than two hours at the site and clicked several pictures of the two towers before interacting with residents of the adjacent buildings and members of the residents’ welfare association (RWA).Rajesh Rana, president of RWA, said the team noted down the concerns of the residents and assured them that “best practices” would be adopted to demolish the two buildings. While announcing its judgment on August 31, the Supreme Court had asked the Noida Authority to take the CBRI’s help in demolishing the twin towers that had been constructed illegally. A special investigation team (SIT) has also been formed to probe the collusion between the developer and Authority officials then. N Gopalakrishnan , the director of the institute, and deputy director Suvir Singh went inside the Apex and Ceyane towers and climbed up several floors to check the condition of the buildings and the setbacks available around them. Engineers of the Authority accompanied the CBRI team and provided them with maps and other documents needed during the inspection.Both Gopalakrishnan and Suvir are civil engineers. While the director specialises in structural dynamics and earthquake engineering, Suvir is an expert of fire engineering. Sources said the visit by the CBRI team followed a letter from the Authority to Gopalakrishnan last week, seeking help in preparing the demolition plan.During their interaction, the residents requested the team of experts and Authority officials to carry out a thorough structural audit and safety tests of Aster 1, Aster 2 and Aspire 1 — the three towers in the vicinity of Apex and Ceyane. The Emerald RWA will also write to the Authority, requesting that a structural engineer hired by them be allowed to join the meetings that would be held in connection with the demolition exercise. It will ask its consultant to present the technique and methodology that is followed globally to keep buildings insulated from high-grade explosions. Putting up blast-resistant glazing around the buildings that may come under the impact of the explosion is one option that is being deliberated upon.As the Authority has just three months to demolish the two buildings, it has urged CBRI to compile its report at the earliest and expedite the process. The CBRI team will go through the specifications of the two buildings that have been captured through the drone surveys and compile its initial report this week itself, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/team-of-cbri-experts-visits-twin-towers-for-inspection/articleshow/86183356.cms||Shalabh

After Independent MLA Pritam Singh Panwar, Congress MLA Rajkumar, too, recently joined the ruling party. Even as Congress leaders were claiming that a few BJP MLAs were in touch with them to switch over, the ruling party has inflicted a severe blow to the rival party by snatching one of its MLAs. Senior leaders of the party, including former CM Harish Rawat, state chief Ganesh Godiyal and leader of opposition Pritam Singh, have been summoned to Delhi by the national leadership on Monday. The three are scheduled to meet the party’s national leadership on Tuesday morning and, thereafter, return to the state capital. After the demise of Indira Hridayesh, Congress came down to 10 MLAs and Rajkumar’s departure has brought down the number further. While Congress seniors maintained it to be a routine visit to Delhi, sources said that leaving of a legislator before election was a “serious issue and the party wants to avoid any such mishaps in the pre-poll period”. A Congress source said, “Things were looking bright after the success of 'Parivartan Yatra', but Rajkumar’s move has come as a jolt.” Congress general secretary Mathura Dutt Joshi sought to play it down and attributed Monday's visit to the fact that it was the birthday of state Congress in-charge Devender Yadav. “It will be followed by a meeting with senior members to discuss preparations of 'Parivartan Yatra', to soon commence in Haridwar,” said Joshi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/amid-rising-chorus-of-ghar-vapsi-ukhand-cong-struggles-to-keep-flock-together-3-party-bigwigs-summoned-to-delhi/articleshow/86178690.cms||Kautilya Singh

This is minutes after he allegedly slaps one of them, according to another video. In a 48-second clip, the guards, led by security in-charge Amaresh Rai, can be purportedly seen asking SK Singh, the resident, how he could slap one them. “Do you hit like this? Being a resident, you are doing something like this?” a guard asks Singh.When one of them says he will call police, Singh purportedly replies, “Call the police… it is a good thing. You call the police and I will show you in the next five minutes,” he can be heard saying while fiddling with his phone.CISS Bureau, the security agency, has alleged that Singh, a businessman, is an influential person and demanded that the police examine his call records. They have said they will move court if an FIR against Singh is not lodged. “Did he call some influential resident or someone in the police? His call records should be probed,” said Sandeep Kumar, regional manager in the agency.Singh, however, raised questions on the contents of the video. “The video is malicious. I have not been part of any such video. I don’t care what they are doing,” he said, before disconnecting the call.Kumar said they had gone to the Sector 39 police station to lodge a complaint against Singh, but were not given any receipt. “This means they did not lodge a separate FIR. We have sent a copy of the complaint to the office of the police commissioner via speed post. We will approach the court, if need be,” he added.Additional DCP Ranvijay Singh clarified they would not lodge a separate FIR but incorporate the complaint with the existing FIR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/lb-row-will-move-court-if-fir-is-not-lodged-says-agency/articleshow/86183380.cms||---
---||Kochi||Intervene to avoid courts staying RTI orders: Info chiefs urge CJI||Kochi: The central and state information commissioners have urged the Chief Justice of India to take up the issue of giving unnecessary stays by courts on RTI orders issued by information commissions across the country. A letter signed by 15 information commissioners, both serving and retired, urged the CJI to consider this serious issue, take a suo motu PIL and issue appropriate directives to make RTI effective in line with the Constitution and the law passed by Parliament. “At least orders of imposition of penalty should not be stayed as no irrevocable harm can come to the penalized official. It should also be ensured that if any stay order is given there should be valid and legal reasons for staying the statutory order of the commission. In case the penalty order is quashed, the amount can be refunded by the exchequer,” the letter said. The letter urged the CJI to direct courts to give reasons how the challenge falls in the writ jurisdiction of the high courts. According to Section 23 of the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005, “No court shall entertain any suit, application or other proceedings in respect of any order made under this Act and no such order shall be called in question otherwise than by way of an appeal under this Act.” Thus Parliament clearly intended that the final appeal will lie with the information commissions. “There are thousands of stay orders issued by the court against RTI orders and many have no legal standing. This has almost destroyed the faith in the effectiveness of the RTI Act. The Act had in fact empowered the common man as an effective tool in exposing corruption in the bureaucracy,” former central information commissioner and RTI activist Shailesh Gandhi said. The letter pointed out that many high courts stay orders of information commissioners where no reasons are given either in the petition or in the orders describing how the challenge would fall under the writ jurisdiction of the court. “These cover orders ordering disclosure of information as well as imposition of penalty,” the letter said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/intervene-to-avoid-courts-staying-rti-orders-info-chiefs-urge-cji/articleshow/86181077.cms||---

Police said the accused, Anil and Meenu Sain, aged 37 and 42, used to lure potential investors for their e-taxi aggregator business via KDM Enterprises Proprietors, better known as Go Way India, by promising to double returns. They were nabbed on Sunday from Gurugram, where they had started an e-bike factory. They had been living earlier in Bengaluru and cities in Maharashtra. The Sains have at least 15 FIRs lodged against them in GB Nagar and 350 complaints in various cities. Harvir Singh, one of the first complainants in the case back in June 2019, alleged that he and his brother invested Rs 27 lakhs in the firm. He also claimed he was threatened by Meenu whenever he would try to approach top cops.  “Somehow, she would always get to know that I was planning to meet senior officers,” he said. Investigating officer Shailendra Tomar said Meenu is a graduate and well-versed with computers while Anil has cleared his intermediate exam. “They targeted retired and serving Army personnel too. Several former armymen from Muzaffarnagar, Ghaziabad, Meerut and Delhi invested in their schemes. My brother and I got Rs 3-4 lakhs as returns in the first three-four months but later those stopped,” he said. Sanjeev Tomar, a retired Army havildar, invested in the scheme on the advice of some friends. He said the accused made some people sign ‘settlement’ documents. “Four-five investors were told their money would be returned but it never was,” he said. Police said at least two more people, Pradeep Sharma and Kunal Sain, are yet to be arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/couple-who-pulled-off-rs-150cr-e-taxi-fraud-held/articleshow/86183405.cms||Shikha Salaria

A test conducted after his death confirmed that he was Covid positive. Hospital staff said when he was admitted on Sept 8, he did not have Covid. Later, he had a stroke and his condition worsened, they added. His funeral will be held in Kochi on Tuesday obeying Covid protocols. He started his career in theatre and worked with groups like Sanghachethana. Though he debuted with ‘Vishupakshi’ in 1984, the film was not released. His first movie that hit the screens was Dr Pasupathy directed by Shaji Kailas. Rizabawa played the hero. But his portrayal of the soft spoken villain John Honai in Siddique-Lal’s In Harihar Nagar endeared him to Malayalis. Even two decades after the film’s release, John Honai remains a cherished character among fans. “His physique, sound modulation, soft and pleasant dialogue delivery made John Honai an exceptional villain in Malayalam movies. A handsome, soft-spoken villain was unheard of in Malayalam films until then,” said director Siddique said. “Every time I met him there was a smile on his face. He was a virtuous and pleasant person and yet, he could play notorious villain roles. It attests his potential as an actor. Unfortunately, he didn’t get many promising roles later,” he added. “Incidentally, it is while playing the role of Swathi Thirunal in Sanghachethana’s play that we handpicked Saikumar for Ramji Rao Speaking and as a replacement for Saikumar, Sanghachethana roped him (Rizabawa) in. It was while acting in the same play that we noted his performance and cast him as John Honai,” Siddique said. Despite starting with the role of a hero, he donned many villain roles. He has acted in 100 films as well as a few Malayalam television serials. His last appearance on the big screen was in ‘Velakkariyayirunnalum Neeyen Mohavalli’ that released in 2018. He was not active in movies for quite some time. Those close to him are of the view that he would have staged a comeback with character roles given his skill to play them to perfection. “Kabuliwala, Nerariyan CBI, Aniyan Bava Chettan Bava are among his noted films.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/rizabawa-who-won-hearts-as-john-honai-passes-away/articleshow/86181189.cms||---

The con men made him transfer the sum to a bank account in July-August. The victim, Mumtaz Ahmed, had bought a life insurance policy with an annual premium of Rs 25,000. However during the covid pandemic, Ahmed suffered a loss in business which resulted in non-payment of the premiums. In July, a fraudster, Kirti Chauhan, allegedly called Ahmed to tell him the company is revoking his policy for non-payment of premiums. He convinced Ahmed he could release the Rs 17 lakh maturity sum on receiving the outstanding Rs 50,000. Ahmed received more calls from four others—Rahul Sharma, Vikas Malik, Ajay Mehra and Sarfaraz Alam—who posed as company staff. They made him transfer money for security charges and GST, in return for a policy bonus. Finally, they told him someone would visit for verification but when no one turned up, Ahmed inquired with the company and learnt he was conned. The victim has registered an FIR under section 420 and 34 of the IPC on September 6.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/mumbai-bizman-duped-of-rs-6l-by-fake-insurance-agents/articleshow/86183469.cms||George Mendonca

The man (appellant) had challenged his conviction, among other things, on the grounds that the trial court, which falls in Latur district, did not consider Forensic Lab, Aurangabad’s DNA test report that ruled him out as a biological father of the girl child born to the survivor. His lawyer had argued that the appellant ought to have been acquitted based on the DNA report and other aspects such as delay in registration of an FIR (on June 23, 2018) and doubts about the survivor’s age as a minor at the time of incident. The prosecution had argued that a DNA report was just a corroborative piece of evidence in support of a testimony and that it can be ignored and the evidence of the victim can be relied upon. The bench of Justice Surendra Tavade upheld the prosecution’s view in the light of other evidence like the age documents proof from her school; the survivor’s “unblemished” testimony _ she identified the appellant (who is her father’s brother) in the court and stated that he would come home drunk and repeatedly rape her _ and the circumstances leading to the registration of FIR. “Though, the DNA report exonerated the appellant, but there is sufficient evidence on record to hold that the appellant had committed rape on the victim,” the bench observed. “Her (survivor’s) evidence is unblemished. Therefore, there is no need to discard it,” the bench ruled. The survivor’s mother, who is visually impaired, lodged a complaint against the accused on June 23, 2018, the very day when she first came to know from her daughter about the rape. The girl was married off on June 10 but within days her husband found that she was four- month pregnant and dropped her back at her parent’s place. That is when the survivor confided in her mother that her uncle had repeatedly raped her in February 2018 and threatened her against disclosing the incident to anyone. The survivor gave birth to a child in October and the DNA samples were then collected as part of the police investigation. The HC bench held that there was no delay in registration of FIR as the mother lodged the complaint the day she came to know about the incident. Moreover, the survivor was threatened into submission by the accused, the HC pointed out and said the prosecution had aptly explained the circumstances leading to registration of FIR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/hc-upholds-10-yr-jail-term-for-man-convicted-for-rape/articleshow/86176087.cms||---

She had come in with high fever and a dropping platelet count, symptoms of the dengue outbreak that has killed 120 in Firozabad so far. The hospital said it had “received no formal complaint” about the death. “We got her to the hospital around 8am. We told the hospital staff about her condition but they did nothing. We waited for four hours to get her admitted. She died in front of me. She would have been fine had she got treatment on time,” her father Ajit Gupta, an entrepreneur, said. The hospital administration said it is adding beds. It has 650 as of now. “We received no formal complaint about a patient dying while waiting for treatment. We are increasing the number of beds to accommodate the increasing number of patients,” chief medical superintendent of Firozabad Medical College, Dr Hansraj Singh, said. Health department officials confirmed that Firozabad has had at least 500 cases of dengue so far. A few cases of malaria, scrub typhus and leptospirosis have also been reported. Sources said the Firozabad Medical College has an 18-bed emergency ward, which now has 34 critical patients. Two-thirds of all dengue patients are children, sources added. Several families like Savanya’s had to deal with the fallout of shrinking hospital space. A daily wager, Netra Pal Singh, said his daughter, 10, died on the way to Agra from Firozabad. “She had a high fever for two days. Her condition deteriorated on Monday morning. I took her to the Firozabad Medical College but she was not admitted there because there was no bed. Staffers there suggested that I take her to Agra. She died on the way.” Shyamveer, a labour contractor, was filling out the paperwork when his child died. “I had to wait for two hours before I could get a bed. By the time I completed the paperwork, my 5-month-old died. Hospital staffers asked me to take him. They didn’t provide a hearse.” Firozabad CMO Dinesh Kumar Premi said the district has 64 camps tending to 4,800 people, including those who have fever. Sources said 12,000 people in the district are estimated to be bedridden with fever.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/girl-5-dies-waiting-for-treatment-outside-hosp-in-firozabad-fever-toll-now-120/articleshow/86176058.cms||Deepak Lavania
---||Delhi||Delhi high court seeks report on safety of Tihar inmates who witnessed gangster’s ‘murder’ in jail||NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Monday sought a status report from Tihar Jail on steps taken to ensure safety and security of the inmates who are witnesses to the alleged murder of Ankit Gujjar in the prison. The court further directed that they be kept in a cell in an area under CCTV monitoring, while seeking the medical report of two witnesses who alleged that they were not being given proper treatment despite suffering “grievous injuries” during the same assault. The court was hearing a petition by the five witnesses seeking directions to ensure their safety and security and restrain the authorities from “threatening/coercing/injuring them with a view to prevent them from seeking justice for themselves and the deceased inmate”. Meanwhile, CBI informed Justice Mukta Gupta that it had registered an FIR regarding the incident in which the 29-year-old gangster was found dead inside his cell in Tihar Jail on August 4. “The director general (prisons) will file a status report indicating measures taken to ensure that the safety and security of petitioner 1 to 3 is being maintained and also on surrender, safety and security of petitioners 4 and 5 will also be maintained,” the judge said. “The DG will also ensure that the petitioners 1-3, in custody, and petitioners 4 and 5, who will surrender on September 24, are kept inside an area where the CCTV is fully functional so that the ingress and egress to the cell is properly monitored.” According to the petition, they are “all inmates of Delhi prisons and are eyewitnesses to the brutal murder of Ankit Gujjar, by respondent no.1 officials, inside Central Jail no. 3 on 03.08.2021”. Two of the petitioners, it claimed, were with Gujjar and suffered the same assault while the others saw the public beating and the events leading to his death. Lawyer Mehmood Pracha, counsel for the petitioners, apprehended threat, injury and pressure from officials to coerce them into changing their stand. He said two of the inmates were released on interim bail on the day of the incident and informed Gujjar’s family about the events. “The sequence of events clearly demonstrates the existence of an imminent threat to the lives of the petitioners on account of the fact that they are eyewitnesses to a gruesome and brutal murder inside the jail premises by influential and powerful jail officials, at the behest of the highest-rung authorities of the administration,” the plea reads. On September 8, the court handed over the probe into Gujjar’s death to CBI saying the postmortem report “belies the version” of the jail officials that a scuffle took place in which both the deputy superintendent and Gujjar were injured. Saying that it is unfathomable that the jail doctor had failed to see the multiple injuries on Gujjar, the court opined that an investigation was needed into not only the offence of brutally beating the deceased but also into “the role of jail doctors in not providing proper treatment at the right time”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-seeks-report-on-safety-of-tihar-inmates-who-witnessed-gangsters-murder-in-jail/articleshow/86181143.cms||---

This was announced by Union jal shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat on Monday. The ministry has allocated Rs 1,275 crore to create sustainable water sources in the escape channels of Indira Gandhi Nagar Yojana (IGNP). The entire exercise will create an additional storage capacity of 1,100 cusec of water in three districts. Speaking on the move, Shekhawat said that he had recently held a meeting with PHED minister B D Kalla in Delhi who pointed that the state, at present, had only a capacity to store 1,031 cusec of water for JJM. ‘There will be no shortage of funds’“The state would require around 2,132 cusec to fulfill its water needs till 2054 under the JJM. The reservoirs under the scheme will come up at Bikaner, Jodhpur and Jaisalmer,” said the minister. Shekhawat said there would be no shortage of funds for the project. “In the state, household water tap connections account for 20.7%. In 2020-21, over 6.77 lakh water connections have been given down under JJM,” said Shekhawat, who added that the state had assured him of providing 30 lakh new connections this financial year. “The Budget allocation for the scheme by the Centre has increased from Rs 2,522 crore to Rs 10,180 crore with the aim of providing tap connections. The state has 101.32 lakh rural household beneficiaries under the scheme," he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/four-reservoirs-forwestern-raj-underjal-jeevan-mission/articleshow/86183547.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi: Viral illnesses take over from Covid-19, hospitals see rush||NEW DELHI: A surge in viral illnesses over the past few weeks has led to increased footfall as well as admission across city hospitals. AtLok Nayak hospital, medical director Dr Suresh Kumar said they are getting 100-120 cases of febrile illness daily. “The number of Covid-19 cases are few. Most of the cases of febrile illness – patients with fever – are either caused by seasonal influenza or dengue which is a mosquito-borne disease,” Dr Kumar said. Dr Suranjit Chatterjee from Apollo and Dr Atul Gogia from Sir Ganga Ram Hospital (SGRH) also confirmed the trend of increase in cases of febrile illnesses. “Unlike the previous year, this time around dengue cases that are coming to us are quite severe. Young patients are being rushed with high-grade fever, a deranged liver function and other severe symptoms,” Dr Chatterjee said. He stressed on the need for strict implementation of measures to reduce the incidence of mosquito-borne diseases, for example preventing stagnation of water in and around households. According to the data shared by municipal corporations, Delhi has recorded 158 cases of dengue and 68 cases of malaria as on September 11 this year. At least 40 cases of chikungunya – another mosquito-borne disease – have also been confirmed. While dengue and chikungunya are spread by aedes aegypti mosquitoes that breed in freshwater, malaria is spread by anopheles mosquito that can breed in dirty water. “This year, the rains have been staggered. We are likely to see more cases of mosquito-borne diseases in the coming days,” Dr Gogia said. The warning signs of dengue include persistent vomiting, mucosal bleeding, difficulty in breathing, lethargy/restlessness and low blood pressure, among others. “Timely medical intervention can help prevent serious complications,” Dr Rakesh Pandit, senior consultant and head of the department of internal medicine at Aakash Healthcare & Super Speciality Hospital, said. He added that they have been getting a lot of patients with viral illnesses since August first week itself. “Initially, most cases were related to seasonal influenza but now we are also seeing cases of mosquito-borne diseases,” Dr Pandit said. “The situation seems to be very critical for kids in some parts of the city. The severity is higher among children and we have seen cases of children who need to get admitted, but there are no casualties so far,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/viral-illnesses-take-over-from-covid-19-hospitals-see-rush/articleshow/86181191.cms||---

---||Pune||Pune: Third list marks down by a fraction, 9,000 seats allotted||PUNE: There was only a marginal dip of two-three points in the cut-off marks in all the big colleges compared to the second list after the third list was announced for admissions to first-year junior college (FYJC) by the centralised admission process (CAP) committee on Monday. Defying the trend, the marks in the third list in Symbiosis College of Arts and Commerce are actually higher than the first and second lists. Against an available 56,664 seats, only 9,261 students have been allotted seats in colleges. Many educationists feel that this year would record the maximum number of vacant seats in FYJC. The students who have been allotted colleges in the third round can confirm their admissions online till 6pm on September 15. They must click on the ‘proceed for admission’ tab if he or she is happy with the allotted college and then upload the required documents and confirm their admission. If a student does not want to take admission in the allotted junior college, they can wait for further rounds. The vacancy list after the third round will be uploaded online on September 16 at 10pm. Hrishikesh Soman, principal of Symbiosis College of Arts and Commerce, said the possible reason for the constant rise in the cut-off marks in his college may be that many students who scored high in Std X have filled up their application forms online after the second round. “Though I can remember that there was a jump in the second list last year also, I cannot remember if there was an increase in the third list too last year. However, this is surprising. We have vacant seats to accommodate students,” Soman said. The least number of applicants were in arts. Against the vacancy of 10,501 seats, only 2,692 students applied and 1,037 students were allotted colleges. Of the 9,261 students who were allotted colleges in the third round, 2,314 students were given their first choice of college. A total of 29,505 students had applied for admissions and only over 9,000 students could get allotments. Officials from CAP have told students to carefully check the vacancy list of colleges when it is released on September 16, compare the last cut-off marks of the college with the marks they have obtained and then change their preference form accordingly so that they have more chances of getting allotted a college in the next rounds. In Mumbai, the list had some of the top rung colleges better their cut-offs by one percent compared to the second round of admissions. A total of 39,965 students were allotted seats in the third general merit list. Of these, 25,539 are com merce seats. A special round is to follow to help all students who have not secured a seat. So far over 1.14 lakh students have taken admissions in class XI. There are over 2 lakh vacant seats. The Nashik division declared the third merit list comprising 2,629 students in 60 junior colleges. The education department has confirmed seat allotment to 11,266 students in different streams. “Over 10,000 students are yet to be allotted seats, which we will do in the forthcoming special round of admissions, that will start shortly,” said officials. Nitin Upasani, the deputy director (Nashik region) of the state education department (Nashik region), told TOI that the department will ensure all students, who have applied get seats. This year 25,380 seats are available for FYJC admissions when the department started the admission process last month. Department officials said in the third merit list, the average cut off in the top science colleges was around 91.2%, 87.6 for commerce and 73.2% for arts. “The department could not accommodate over 7,752 students in the third merit list although they were eligible due to different factors like choice of college given by the student, cut-off marks etc,” said officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/third-list-marks-down-by-a-fraction-9k-seats-allotted/articleshow/86181175.cms||Ardhra Nair

---||India||Sterlite case police firing ‘scar on democracy’: Madras HC||CHENNAI: Asserting that the 2018 police firing on anti-Sterlite protestors in Tuticorin was a scar on the face of our democracy, the Madras high court said citizens should not be fired at the behest of any corporate house. “Also, the state should consider a realistic quantum of compensation for either category, apart from others who suffered injuries,” the court said on certain measures suggested by the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), including enhancing the compensation to the families of those who died and or were injured. “If there is any indication that firing was resorted to on behalf of any corporate, it must be addressed,” the first bench of chief justice Sanjib Banerjee and justice P D Audikesavalu said on Monday. The court then directed the NHRC to report the steps taken to find a logical conclusion to the issue based on the report of its investigation division. On the probe being conducted by the CBI, the bench said: “The matter should be brought to its logical end, as expeditiously as possible, to give a meaningful closure to it and the circumstances in which firing had to be resorted to against unarmed citizens must come out in the report.” The state is requested to play the real parental role in providing counselling and psychiatric assistance to the members of the bereaved families, if necessary, the court added. “The state must be seen to be with the families and not an adversary, despite whatever may have happened. The state needs to walk the extra mile for such purpose and the learned Advocate-General is requested to ensure that appropriate measures are taken to assuage the feelings of the families of the victims” the judges said. The directions were passed on a PIL moved by rights activist Henri Tiphagne seeking direction to the NHRC to reopen the probe and to furnish a report of the investigation. Protests by locals against Vedanta’s copper unit Sterlite over pollution concerns peaked on May 22, 2018, leading to violence that resulted in 13 deaths in police firing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sterlite-case-police-firing-scar-on-democracy-madras-hc/articleshow/86186249.cms||---

He also released an RTI document from the agricultural officer, Kizhakkambalam, which clarified that there wasn’t any evidence of pollution caused by Kitex. “It was P T Thomas and other MLAs who had complained at a district development committee meeting that Kitex was polluting Kadambrayar. However, after the meeting that was convened by the district collector today for discussing the issue, why the MLAs P T Thomas, Eldhose Kunnappilly and P V Sreenijin were silent on this topic when they met the media?,” Jacob asked. He said the complaint was investigated by multiple departments of the state government. “Officials inspected all the fields and streams near the company in detail and they took water samples at a gap of every kilometre from the stream. They even used drone for this. During the inspection of the 15km stretch up to Kadambrayar river, they found no trace of pollution in the streams near Kitex. On the other hand, the severity of the pollution increased as it approached Kadambrayar. It is clear from this that the waste from residential flats and other industrial establishments is polluting the river,” Jacob said. He also said that the Rs13-crore funds saved by the Kizhakkambalam panchayat is reflective of the fact that corruption was in check. He said that not only the road towards Kitex was being rebuilt, but also 90% of the roads in the panchayat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/complainant-mlas-mum-now/articleshow/86181262.cms||---

Four of the five colleges are located in Haridwar district while the remaining one is in Tehri. The move has been a blow to the several protests which were witnessed for the past one year across the state by the staff members of the government-aided colleges. The protestors had then claimed that the shift of the affiliation from a central university to a state university will hamper the college’s brand and also, it is injustice against those students who had got their admission considering the college’s affiliation to a central university. The staffers of the Doon-based DAV College was at the forefront of protest. The transfer of affiliation is being hailed by the state government and the higher education minister Dhan Singh Rawat. "The decision of getting affiliated to a state university is a good one as it will bring more prosperity to the respective aided college,” said Rawat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/five-govt-aided-colleges-shift-affiliation-to-sri-dev-suman/articleshow/86178900.cms||Mohammad Anab

A section of stakeholders had taken a strong objection to three appointments at the university. Earlier, Bamu had ordered an inquiry under retired judge P R Bora to look into allegations about the appointments. The inquiry had given a clean chit to the trio, but the management council of the university, earlier this year, refused to accept the probe findings. The members of statutory body concerned demanded a fresh inquiry, following which, the Nimse panel was formed. Sanjay Nimbalkar, management council member of Bamu, on Monday said the panel led by Nimse was expected to carry out a thorough inquiry into charges surrounding the three appointments in question. “It was ironical that despite having strong proof and evidence, the trio was absolved of all charges and they continued to hold the key posts. The management council expects that a thorough investigation will take place by scrutinising all available proof and evidence this time. it is in the best interest of the university and students among other stakeholders,” he said. Stating that the pandemic situation and restrictions associated with it has already delayed the investigation process, political activist Nagraj Gaikwad, one of the complainants, has demanded speedy probe into the matter. “Its been more than a year since these appointments were made and the authorities concerned continue to enjoy their posts despite serious charges against them,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/panel-to-probe-allegations-of-3-irregular-bamu-appointments/articleshow/86176313.cms||---

CBI had already conducted searches at numbers of places across India including Pune, Indore, Jamshedpur, Delhi NCR and other places. The searches were conducted at around half dozen tuition classes, coaching centers and such places connected to JEE mains. CBI had already registered FIR against a coaching center and its directors. Sources stated CBI teams collected documents like the mock test questions papers, printed notes, lecture and test series specimens and records of the ongoing online classes. The investigation agency also collected electronic evidences too from the offices of these education institutions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cbi-conducts-searches-in-connection-to-jee-paper-leak/articleshow/86178933.cms||Soumitra Bose

Singh, who was here on Monday, blamed police for remaining a mute spectator on crimes on Dalits until the matter was raised by the BJP. “The state government has failed on all fronts especially on putting an end to the crimes against the Dalits,” said Arya, while quoting a recent incident in Bhilwara where a Dalit groom was stopped from riding a horse. “It is unfortunate that such incidents are still happening right under the nose of the government, which claims itself to be the government of poor and vulnerable,” said Arya, who also pointed out that a particular community state was enjoying the patronage of the state while committing crimes against the Dalits. Arya is here to convene a national meet on SC Morchs in Sikar on Tuesday. BJP’s state president of SC Morcha Kailesh Meghwal and BJP state president Satish Poonia will address the meet. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bjp-sc-morcha-chief-slams-govt-for-crimes-against-dalits/articleshow/86183609.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Lord Krishna devotees oppose mining in Bharatpur hills||JAIPUR: Devotees of Lord Krishna from 70-80 villages are protesting against alleged illegal mining that is eating away the twin hills, Kankachal and Aadibadri, related to the deity for the last 242 days at Pasopa village in Bharatpur’s Deeg Tehsil. A delegation under the Braj Parvat Evum Paryavaran Sanrakshan Samiti (BPEPS) met Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi on September 11 to exert pressure on CM Ashok Gehlot to cancel the mining lease. The movement is getting international attention among Krishna’s devotees in the US and Canada. Ancient scriptures say that Lord Krishna spent time performing trance in these two hills. The mining lease was granted on 736 hectares 15 years ago in Deeg tehsil, which comes under Braj land. Initially, the mining was done in a limited area, while the twin hills that hold religious significance was very far away from the leased area. The area is used for mining of masonry stones used in building materials. “The locals realized in 2009 that the lease has been extended and the twin hills have come under the leased area. Since then, we have been lobbying with the consecutive governments, but nothing has happened,” said Pradeep Mathur of BPEPS. The issue was highlighted in 2019 when the miner allegedly started extracting 2000 trucks of masonry stones every day. The speed of mining shocked the locals who held a meeting with priests to save the Braj land. “The hills are now under the danger of being razing to the ground. It’s now or never like situation for us. Exercising our democratic rights we have started Dharna,” said Mathur. Interestingly, 5,232 hectares around the 736 hectares is a notified area under the forest department. The body accused the state mines department of deliberately skipping the 736 hectares, which is delivering good masonry stones for mining by ignoring the religious importance of the area. The entire area falls in three tehsils of Bharatpur—Deeg, Kaman and Nagar. The protestors have received support from Kaman MLA Wajib Ali, who sat with them at the protest site on several occasions. Radhapriya Barsana, a member of the BPEPS, said Priyanka Gandhi assured them of taking the matter with her party’s government. “Our body has received a call from the chief minister’s office collecting information regarding the same,” said Barsana, who claimed that the devotees of Lord Krishna are peace-loving souls protesting without causing any inconvenience to anyone. Wajib Ali, who has been supporting the cause, has written to Gehlot to look into the matter and to give a proper hearing to the devotees. “The issue needs urgent attention since locals, devotees and priests have been holding protest for quite long. I will try to raise the issue in the ongoing Vidhan Sabha,” said Ali. TOI called up additional chief secretary of mines department, Subodh Agrawal and a special secretary to CM Arti Dogra, who has been handling the issue but got no response.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/krishna-devotees-oppose-mining-in-bharatpur-hills/articleshow/86183585.cms||---

She had come in with high fever and a dropping platelet count, symptoms of the dengue outbreak that has killed 120 in Firozabad so far. The hospital said it had “received no formal complaint” about the death. “We got her to the hospital around 8am. We told the hospital staff about her condition but they did nothing. We waited for four hours to get her admitted. She died in front of me. She would have been fine had she got treatment on time,” her father Ajit Gupta, an entrepreneur, said. The hospital administration said it is adding beds. It has 650 as of now. “We received no formal complaint about a patient dying while waiting for treatment. We are increasing the number of beds to accommodate the increasing number of patients,” chief medical superintendent of Firozabad Medical College, Dr Hansraj Singh, said. Health department officials confirmed that Firozabad has had at least 500 cases of dengue so far. A few cases of malaria, scrub typhus and leptospirosis have also been reported. Sources said the Firozabad Medical College has an 18-bed emergency ward, which now has 34 critical patients. Two-thirds of all dengue patients are children, sources added. Several families like Savanya’s had to deal with the fallout of shrinking hospital space. A daily wager, Netra Pal Singh, said his daughter, 10, died on the way to Agra from Firozabad. “She had a high fever for two days. Her condition deteriorated on Monday morning. I took her to the Firozabad Medical College but she was not admitted there because there was no bed. Staffers there suggested that I take her to Agra. She died on the way.” Shyamveer, a labour contractor, was filling out the paperwork when his child died. “I had to wait for two hours before I could get a bed. By the time I completed the paperwork, my 5-month-old died. Hospital staffers asked me to take him. They didn’t provide a hearse.” Firozabad CMO Dinesh Kumar Premi said the district has 64 camps tending to 4,800 people, including those who have fever. Sources said 12,000 people in the district are estimated to be bedridden with fever.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/up-girl-dies-waiting-at-hospital-dengue-toll-120/articleshow/86186258.cms||Deepak Lavania

Opposition leader Gulab Chand Kataria in an adjournment motion said the power bills are giving a shock to the people already reeling under the impact of Covid. He said power per unit in the state is highest at Rs 8.13 per unit. He said not only is the cost per unit very high, but another factor troubling the consumer is the charges levied on the load factor. He said even if a consumer hadn’t used a single unit of power, he has to pay a mandatory Rs 800 per month of connection as fixed charges.

Police said Jaswinder Singh, 30, a resident of Uchi Daud village, helped a Pakistan intelligence operative honeytrap defence personnel. The Pakistani woman had also managed to join two of their WhatsApp groups. Jaswinder, who works in a factory in Malerkotla, had become friends with the woman after meeting her on a social media site about a year ago.Additional deputy commissioner of police (investigation) Rupinder Kaur Bhatti said, “After we received inputs from Air Force intelligence unit, Jodhpur, we detained Jaswinder. During questioning, he revealed that he had met the woman on Facebook and she introduced herself as Jasleen Brar of Bathinda. She had claimed that she worked in the Army’s accounts branch in Bathinda Cantt. To win his trust, the woman shared audio clips on the movement of battalions. Jaswinder was beguiled by her as he, too, wanted to join the defence forces but could not clear the exams.”“After winning Jaswinder’s trust, the woman asked him to provide her some WhatsApp numbers, saying she needed those for secret operations and was too busy to go out and get them. Jaswinder believed her and helped her get three numbers. The woman used these numbers to further contact seven defence personnel and tried to honeytrap them. She also managed to join two WhatsApp groups of defence personnel, ‘Western cmd mutual posting’ and ‘MES information update’. She monitored their chats and tried to contact more defence personnel,” added the ADCP.The defence officials are not allowed to have any WhatsApp groups and these were made unofficially.“Even as Jaswinder realized that the woman was fooling him and would not marry him, he stayed in touch with her. Once, she deposited Rs 10,000 in his bank account via PhonePe application. However, later, she told him to transfer the amount to an SBI account of Pune. Also, in an audio message the woman asked Jaswinder to go to Jaipur bus stand to get a CD. We are verifying it,” the officer said.An FIR under the Official Secret Act and the IPC has been registered at Division 6 police station.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/maloud-man-30-held-for-helping-pak-agent/articleshow/86178938.cms||---

Receiving such inflows, which is the first during the current rainy season, has resulted in a sharp rise in the live storage of Jayakwadi major irrigation project. Nathsagar, the dam reservoir, was showing nearly 60% live storage with inflow at the speed of 32,000 cusec by Monday evening expected to further increase the overall storage, show official data. Among other major irrigation projects catering to the region, the Upper Penganga dam, also known as Isapur dam, built on Penganga river near Kalamnuri in Hingoli district, has started overflowing by Monday afternoon. The dam, which caters to parts of Marathwada and Vidarbha region, was releasing the water at the speed of 1,374 cusec, said the authorities attached with the flood control room of Godavari Marathwada Irrigation Development Corporation (GMIDC). Majalgaon dam in Beed district and Lower Dudhna dam in Parbhani district were among the major irrigation projects from the region, that was overflowing by Monday afternoon. GMIDC executive director Kiran Kulkarni said relatively lower storage in Jayakwadi dam was a concern, but now it has started getting addressed due to inflow from upstream areas. “Major dams from upstream areas including Gangapur dam, Bhandardara dam and Nilwande dam are overflowing and expected to continue the release of water towards Jayakwadi dam if the good run of monsoon sustains in catchment areas,” he said. As per the official data, major, medium and minor irrigation projects were holding cumulative live storage of 127.4 TMC by Monday afternoon, as against the designed capacity of 260.3 TMC. These reservoirs had better storage (180 TMC) during the corresponding period last year. The shortfall is attributed to larger storage in Jayakwadi dam last year as it was overflowing on September 13, 2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/jayakwadi-dam-stock-increases-due-to-inflows-from-upstream-areas/articleshow/86176401.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The seven-kanal park is being developed on the common land of the village by the park development committee and majority of the work has been completed. Villager Balbir Singh said as there was no park in the village, NRI Gurdev Singh donated money for it. “Earlier too, the NRI gave money for the development of the village. A five-member park management committee was constituted for the construction on the insistence of the NRI.” Balwinder Singh, a member of the committee, said, “There was no park in the village and we didn’t get any help from the government. After the NRI donated money, we started the work about one-and-a-half years ago. Because of Covid, the work suffered, but it is nearing completion now. The park has two gazebos with chairs for people. There is a space for women with chairs, swings for children and a water cooler. The government didn’t help us, but they should at least provide an open-air gym.”Villager Iqbal Singh said the park sees a rush of visitors in mornings and evenings. Villagers are also elated. “I am happy that a park has come up in the village and other infrastructure is being developed,” said fuel station businessman Raghuvir Singh, who has been living in Birtamod, Nepal, for the past 42 years. Jaspreet Singh, a child from the village who regularly goes to the park, said, “I come here to play, besides there are swings too.”  Helping in development Residents said the village has around 150 NRIs who live in Canada, England, New Zealand, the United States and Australia. They have helped in the construction of a state-of-the-art stadium, a private college with nominal fees for girl students and a dharamshala.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/nri-donates-money-for-a-park-in-jagraon-village/articleshow/86178974.cms||Shariq Majeed
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Aminabad ke Raja meets devotees from a swing with Covid protocols||LUCKNOW: The ‘raja’ has arrived and the 24-odd members belonging to Shri Ganesh Utsav Mandal (Aminabad) have immersed themselves in various activities to celebrate their Ganpati, fondly known as ‘Aminabad ke Raja’. The eco-friendly idol is sitting on a grand swing, swinging to and fro, as devotees come and pay their obeisance. Temperatures and masks are checked before devotees enter the temple premises. The committee members say this year feels different not only because of the pandemic, but also because this is the 31st year of organising Ganesh Chaturthi in the bylanes of Aminabad. “We had plans to celebrate the festival in a bigger way, but Covid stalled our plans. We feel blessed though that we have been able to welcome ‘Baappa’ and organise a small affair,” said Atul Awasthi, organiser of the festival. In 1990, a group of 10-12 people came together under the leadership of Tanhaji Rao, a Maharashtrian trader who worked in a gold and silver refinery, to start Ganesh Chaturthi in the city. At that time, Lucknow was aloof to the festival as only a handful of Ganpati Puja pandals used to happen. “When Tanhaji began propagating the idea of organising such a festival, the residents of Aminabad hailed it as ‘Bambaiya tyohar’ (a festival of Bombay). But with a little persuasion, people joined in and the festival gained momentum. A few years down the line, Tanhaji and his family moved to Indore and later he passed away, giving me and the other members the responsibility of carrying forward his legacy,” he added. Now, Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations have undergone various changes. Now, there is a theme around the festival every year. Today, the idol is around 4ft high and the festival is celebrated over seven days. What hasn’t changed is the way members of the community see themselves as one big family which transcends itself to a nuclear household. “What started off with funding of just Rs 25 now sees donations in thousands. The admiration and support of devotees and keeps us going. Next year, we hope to welcome Baappa in the biggest way possible,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/aminabad-ke-raja-meets-devotees-from-a-swing-with-covid-protocols/articleshow/86183691.cms||Aditi Singh
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Lawmakers from ruling & opposition parties should remain cordial, says Ghulam Nabi Azad||JAIPUR: Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad on Monday called for good working relations between ruling and opposition party legislators, recalling his own experiences with late Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Speaking at the inaugural session of a seminar on ‘Parliamentary System and People’s Expectations’ organised by the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association (CPA) in the state assembly, Azad said, “There should be enough understanding among MLAs to appreciate good work. If there are distances, even good work will not get support.” Azad said when he was the Union parliamentary affairs minister, he used to share a strong bond with the then leader of opposition Vajpayee and used to lunch with him in every two-three days. Azad said the legislature, judiciary and executive have well defined roles and responsibilities, however, the legislature is the first among the equals as without laws passed by it, there is no relevance of the other two. Speaking on the occasion, Union minister for road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari called upon the MLAs to conduct politics of development with commitment to ideology. Gadkari said that there is no dearth of funds for development but of strong will power. Describing water and roads as the basis of development, he said that there is no shortage of water but there is a lack of planning to conserve and utilise it. Gadkari said that until more than 50% area gets covered under irrigation, the farmer will not be able to prosper. The minister stressed on bringing changes in crop patterns according to demand. He said currently India is importing oil, so oil seed cultivation could fetch good returns.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/azad-lawmakers-from-ruling-oppn-parties-should-remain-cordial/articleshow/86183647.cms||---

After the news broke out about the alleged encounter killing of the four accused on December 6, 2019 at Chattanpally near Shadnagar, Sajaya along with women’s and other organisations, wrote a letter to the high court chief justice appealing for immediate steps to ensure proper investigation into the case and direct necessary action in accordance with the law against police action, which seemed suspicious. A writ petition (PIL) was taken up by the court based on the representation. On Monday, Sajaya deposed before the commission. The day began with commission’s advocate, K Parameshwar asking Sajaya if she has any personal knowledge about the arrest of the accused in the Disha gang-rape and murder case or the subsequent alleged encounter killings. Sajaya responded saying that she came to know about the developments through the media. The deponent further answered that she met some of the family members of the deceased at their villages and the family of Chennakeshavulu had mentioned that he was a minor. The commission members asked Sajaya to produce the video of then Cyberabad police commissioner V C Sajjanar’s press conference at Chattanpally on the day of the alleged encounter after she mentioned about it during her deposition. When the commission’s advocate asked her “On what basis do you say that the alleged encounter was carried out under the leadership of CP V C Sajjanar?”, Sajaya mentioned about Sajjanar being the police unit officer in-charge as commissioner of Cyberabad when the alleged encounter killings of the accused in the Disha case took place in 2019 and the same officer was in charge of Warangal district as SP when three acid attack case accused were killed in an alleged encounter in 2008. During the cross-examination, V Surender Rao, advocate for Telangana government, and other advocates representing different police personnel linked to the case, pointed out various mistakes in the affidavits filed by Sajaya. Rao also asked Sajaya whether she was trying to gain mileage by sensationalising the exchange of fire. She responded with a no. They also posed questions about her journalistic credentials. At the end of the day’s session, the commission started recording the statement of Disha case accused Ch Chennakeshavulu’s 17-year-old wife. When asked on what basis did Sajaya claim the alleged encounter was carried out under VC Sajjanar’s orders, she mentioned that the same officer was SP of Warangal district when three accused in an acid attack were killed in an alleged encounter in 2018||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/journo-recalls-warangal-encounters-of-sajjanar/articleshow/86183943.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

But in their zeal to support the victim’s family, many people are giving out the identity of the girl, which is a clear violation of Supreme Court directives. On December 11, 2018, the Supreme Court had barred disclosing identity of rape victims, even after their death. “No person can print or publish in print, electronic, social media, etc the name of the victim or even in a remote manner disclose any facts which can lead to the victim being identified and which should make her identity known to the public at large,” read an order of a bench headed by Justice Madan B Lokur. Despite this, outrage against the perpetrators has led to netizens not only sharing her name, but also gory pictures and videos of the incident. A handful of politicians too shared videos where they can be seen visiting the minor’s relatives at their home. “This is not the first time that the identity of a rape victim has been disclosed on social media so unabashedly” says Khaja Aijazuddin, a Telangana high court lawyer, who had filed a petition over Islamophobic content on social media. “In this case, it happens to be a minor and it is all the more important for people to be sensitive. The lawyer added that disclosing the identity of the victim amounts to a criminal offence and the cyber crime police should not only have these posts removed but also hold people accountable for circulating the identity of the girl. Many posts seeking justice for the victim have been retweeted, liked and shared by thousands of netizens, increasing their reach over the last few days. Several hashtags using the victim’s name have fuelled protests, but also broken the law. “Section 74 of the Juvenile Justice Act prohibits disclosure of the identity of the children,” says Dhanasiri Prakash, general secretary of the Child Rights Protection Forum. “It is not just the responsibility of the police and the media but also people at large to understand the provisions under which children should be protected. One must deal with such cases with extreme sensitivity,” Prakash added.

In its latest circular issued on Monday the insurance regulator said all insurers are permitted to offer and renew short-term Covid specific health policies up to March 31, 2022. As per earlier norms, the Corona Kavach and Corona Rakshak policies of any tenure were allowed to be renewed for further terms of three-and-half-months, six-and-half-months or nine-and-half-months as per the choice of policyholder till September 30, 2021. Now, with the new IRDAI directive, policyholders will be able to renew it till the end of this financial year. While the Corona Kavach is an indemnity-based product, Corona Rakshak is a benefit-based product. While benefit policies pay a fixed amount following a claim, indemnity plans provide either cashless or reimbursement for the money spent on medical treatment. Beside granting extension to the sale of Covid specific policies, the insurance watchdog also allowed general insurers to continue issuance of electronic policies as well as dispensing with physical documents and wet signatures till March 31, 2022. IRDAI had allowed these exemptions in the wake of Covid-induced lockdown when insurance companies as well as policyholders were finding it an uphill task to dispatch as well as receive and sign policy documents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/insurance-cos-can-sell-renew-corona-policies-till-march-22/articleshow/86184045.cms||---

The four accused in the rape and murder of Disha were killed in an alleged encounter in December 2019. Referring to reports that the child’s rapist was high on ganja before the crime, Revanth said: “Such perpetrators of crime should be killed in encounters. The revenue to the government from liquor has gone up to Rs 36,000 crore per annum. Youth are falling prey to liquor and drugs, including ganja. Has the city police commissioner visited the residence of the victim?” The TPCC president wanted to know if the accused had been arrested or not and said that CM K Chandraeskhar Rao should visit the the child’s poor family. He alleged that atrocities against girls and women, mainly from tribal and Dalit families, were on the rise in Telangana. “The state government should extend all support to the family,” he said.

---||Aurangabad||Auranagbad: Stakeholders want Ajanta-Ellora to be open on Saturdays & Sundays||AURANGABAD: Different stakeholders from the local tourism and hospitality industry have demanded the reopening of Ajanta-Ellora caves on weekends for tourists. At present, these monuments are open from Monday to Friday and remain closed on Saturdays and Sundays as a part of the Covid-related restrictions. Aurangabad Tourism Development Foundation (ATDF), an umbrella body of different stakeholders concerned, has pointed out that the maximum footfall of tourists is observed on weekends. “The tourism and hospitality industry is finding it very difficult to survive due to the extended Covid-related curbs involving different monuments and heritage sites. We have established contact with different authorities from the state and the Centre, but to no avail,” said ADTF founder president Jaswant Singh. In one of the latest correspondences, the state tourism department had referred the demand to the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), adding that the district administration also has its say that needs to be considered. When contacted, ASI superintendent archaeologist (Aurangabad circle) Milan Kumar Chauley said he was waiting for the approval of Aurangabad district administration to allow Ajanta- Ellora caves to remain open on weekends. “The central authorities have asked us to regulate the visiting days and hours of heritage sites as per the instructions from the respective district administrations. While malls and other public places are allowed to remain open, there is no harm in allowing visitors to places of historic importance on weekends by following Covid appropriate behaviour,” he said. Stating that demand concerned was placed during every weekly Covid review meeting held by Aurangabad district administration, ASI authorities said they were expecting a favourable reply soon. Aurangabad district collector Sunil Chavan, who is also the chairman of the disaster management authority, said the district administration will consider the demand on a positive note. “As per my knowledge, no other ASI governed monuments operate on weekends during the current pandemic. The fears associated with the possibility of the Covid third wave also has a bearing on the decision-making,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/stakeholders-want-ajanta-ellora-to-be-open-on-saturdays-sundays/articleshow/86176483.cms||---

Overall, the positivity rate across the 14 districts of the region over the past 20 days has been under 2%. Furthermore, the positivity rate in Bidar, Gadag, Bagalkot, Haveri and Yadgir districts is below 1%. According to data from the health and family welfare department, the 14 districts have cumulatively reported 449 Covid-19 cases over the past eight days. Gadag district, meanwhile, has not reported a single case of Covid-19 since September 5. Health department officials in these districts, however, dismissed allegations of cases being underreported. They attributed the surge in patients at the OPD of hospitals to the spike in cases of viral fever. President of Indian Medical Association (IMA), Belagavi Dr Anil Patil opined that the number of fresh cases in the past several days. “Some cases are not being reported since the patients are not undergoing RT-PCR test. On the other hand, the number of fresh viral fever cases have gone up,” Dr Patil said. Another doctor at a private hospital said that there were two to three patients coming to the hospital who were testing positive on the CT scan. “But these cases are not being reported in the health department bulletin since the patients do not want to undergo an RT-PCR test,” he said. Gadag-based Dr Pavan Patil, who collected data on the high resolution computerised tomography (HRCT) from all scanning centres across the district, said that underreporting of cases was the consequence of flaws in the government policy. “During the second wave, around 40% of the patients who tested negative for the novel coronavirus in the RT-PCR test tested positive when subjected to HRCT examination. The RT-PCR test cannot detect the new strain of the virus. This means that nearly 40% of the cases were not reported,” Dr Pavan said. On the current situation, he said that the new variants and the reduced severity of the infection among patients who have been administered the Covid-19 vaccine, had resulted in many cases going unreported. “There has been a significant spurt in the number of patients being admitted, both children and adults alike, with symptoms of Covid-19. The state government has to change the policy, and gather data from CT scan reports of patients. The true picture will come out once this data gets compiled,” Dr Pavan Patil said. Dr Maqsood Chanda, a retired government doctor from Bidar, said that five Covid-19 patients were being treated at each hospital. “According to the district bulletin published by the Bidar health department, the district is registering only zero to two cases daily. But patients and hospitals are not reporting cases to the health department. An eye doctor from Dharwad said that he got infected despite having been administered both doses,” Dr Chanda said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/covid-cases-being-under-reported-in-north-karnataka-fear-doctors/articleshow/86177534.cms||Shreyas HS

The International Institute of Information Technology-Hyderabad (IIIT-H) along with tech giant Intel, NMC (Nagpur Municipal Corporation) and CSIR-Central Road Research Institute (CRRI), among other partners, have launched project iRASTE (intelligent Solutions for Road Safety through Technology and Engineering) in Nagpur. As part of this project, the partners will be leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology to reduce road accident incidents by around 50% in Nagpur city in the next two years and create a model that can be scaled up and replicated in the entire country, Nivruti Rai, country head, Intel India and vice-president, Intel Foundry Services, said on Monday. iRASTE will focus on three key aspects -- vehicle safety, mobility analysis and road infrastructure safety. Under this project, NMC’s fleet of vehicles will be equipped with collision avoidance system, a subset of Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS), that can reduce accidents and near misses by up to 60%. Currently, around 30 buses in Nagpur have been fitted with such devices and this will be scaled up to around 350 in coming days. These sensors will also help map current accident-prone areas as well as the likely accident zones in the entire road network, helping road maintenance agencies to intervene at an early stage and go for preventive maintenance. Shekhar C Mande, DG, CSIR, said, “CSIR-Central Road Research Institute (CRRI) will help in identifying the accident-prone locations and also evaluate the drivers’ behaviour before and after installation of collision avoidance systems in their vehicles. This project can be emulated in different cities as well.” While Intel India will bring its ADAS technology, CRRI will leverage its domain expertise in road engineering and IIIT-Hyderabad will be undertaking AI-based research to address population-scale road safety through its INAI center for applied AI research. Even, Mahindra & Mahindra will conduct road safety public awareness programs and driver trainings in Nagpur.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/iiit-h-intel-to-leverage-ai-to-make-nagpur-roads-safer/articleshow/86184094.cms||---
---||Goa||Churchill Bros prepare for I-League season ahead with two new foreigners||Panaji: Churchill Brothers FC have agreed terms with Brazilian midfielder Guilherme Escuro and Lebanese central defender Shadi Skaf for this season. Goa’s only club in the I-League finished runnersup last season, after leading the race for most part. They had released all four foreigners and are now rebuilding their team under Romanian coach Petre Gigiu, now into his second stint at the club. The two-time champions last won the league in the 2012-13 season with Roberto Mendes Silva (Beto) being their last Brazilian signing. “We have signed Guilherme Escuro. We had Beto in the past and he was very good that year when we won the league. I think Brazil with I-League and Goans is a good playing style,” Churchill Bros CEO Valanka Alemao told TOI on Tuesday. Escuro, 27, last played for Retro Futebol Clube Brasil. Valanka believes the Brazilian will be a bright prospect and will easily adjust to the playing conditions here. “Even the weather helps them because some Europeans come and then the heat is a problem. I think with all these factors and with the player who really wants to come and perform, it’s good,” said Valanka. Churchill’s former Lebanese centre-back Bilal Najjarin had influenced the signing of Hamza Kheir, who was adjudged the league’s best defender. Najjarin has now recommended Skaf. “We had this player Bilal in the past and he (Skaf) is also from that area. Last year we had Hamza, so I think it's going to be a good season,” said Valanka. Skaf is also 27 and has represented his country once. He last played for Al-Ahli Akhaa Aley in the Lebanon premier league. Churchill have already signed Guinean forward Sekou Sylla and have one more foreign player quota left to be filled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/churchill-bros-prepare-for-i-league-season-ahead-with-two-new-foreigners/articleshow/86212803.cms||FLAVIO LOPES

In the past, senior officials of Hyderabad police had stated that action will be initiated against anyone disclosing victim’s identity. However, no action has been taken on users over the Saidabad incident so far. Besides social media, several protesters who have been rallying in support of the victim’s family have also disclosed the minor victim’s name and picture. “We have identified few accounts from which messages were uploaded in support of the victim by disclosing her identity. We have asked the concerned social media groups to delete such posts and a response (from the companies’ side) is awaited,” a cyber crime police official informed TOI. While there are several comments about the incident on social media disclosing the victim’s identity, police have claimed that they could find only a few such accounts. “The identity of victim was revealed while she was still missing but we are examining legal options and will take further action as per legal opinion,’’ a senior Hyderabad police told TOI on condition of anonymity. A similar situation had prevailed following the rape and murder of the veterinary doctor in 2019 when several social media users had disclosed the picture and identity of the victim.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/delete-posts-revealing-victim-info-cops/articleshow/86183158.cms||---

---||Hyderabad||Telangana pushes for work from office in IT firms||HYDERABAD: In a fresh push to get people back in office, the state health department on Monday urged the managements of IT companies in Hyderabad to resume work from office. The employees in the IT industry have been mostly working from home since March last year following the Covid-19 pandemic. While the threat of a third wave still hangs over the country, public health director G Srinivasa Rao on Monday claimed that the workforce in the city was ready to head back to office as their family members were 100% vaccinated. Stating that a representation has been sent to the state IT department, Rao said, “Apart from your employees, livelihood of lakhs of people such as food vendors is dependent on IT companies. Taking all that into consideration, we request the managements to reopen offices.” He also said there have been no clusters or outbreak of Covid-19 cases in three months after the most recent lockdown was lifted in the state. A similar request was made by state IT department to resume work from office in July. However, at the time many raised concerns saying reopening the offices and schools might pave the way for third wave of Covid-19. Further, out of the 1.15 lakh students who have been screened during the last 10 days after educational institutions reopened, health department officials claimed that only 55 students tested positive. “There are no cluster cases in schools,” a senior health department official said. Boy tests positive in school A class 9 student of Government Boys High School, Himayatnagar, CPL, Amberpet, tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday.

Stating that the playground in question has been in use for daily practice and other different sporting activities, including that for organising major sporting events, for more than 15 years, the players have demanded an alternative site for setting up the new facilities. “Udgir town has only two playgrounds and one of them is slated to get erased for constructing an auditorium and a cultural hall. Udgir has produced sports champions at different levels, who practised on the same ground,” Ajit Shinde, one of the protesters, said. The protesters have approached the local authorities as well as chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and Latur district guardian minister Amit Deshmukh to oppose the upcoming constructions, which are proposed by the Latur Zilla Parishad. “We are not against the setting up of an auditorium and a cultural hall as these facilities are also essential for the cultural growth in our area. However, the same should not come at the cost of an existing playground, which has an illustrious past of holding major events and producing great players,” Shinde said.

---||Thiruvananthapuram||No rift in Kerala CPI over D Raja issue: Kanam Rajendran||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: CPI state secretary Kanam Rajendran on Monday said it was improper to construe his reaction to a question at a news conference regarding the propriety of CPI state council’s criticism of party national general secretary D Raja as his open criticism against the general secretary. Rajendran also dismissed the rumours that there was division in the party state unit over criticising Raja. Rajendran said there was no difference of opinion in the CPI regarding the state council’s decision to point out the inappropriateness in party general secretary’s reaction on the allegations raised by his wife and party leader Annie Raja against Kerala police. “I believe the national secretariat member Binoy Viswom must have by now communicated to Raja the state council’s decision. There is no two opinion in the state unit over this,” Rajendran said. Dismissing the reports that senior party leader K E Ismail maintained a critical view on Rajendran’s open statements against the party national general secretary, Rajendran said there was no two opinion in the state unit on violation of party code by Raja. “If Ismail has to say something, he need not to write a letter to me. We were attending the meeting together,” Rajendran said. However, when the rumours about Ismail writing a letter to the national and state leadership was raised again, he asked reporters,”For what else you think there is post office?” The CPI secretary also said the religious heads should not indulge in activities that would create divide among people in the society. He was reacting to the Pala bishop’s words of caution to the believers about the dangers posed by ‘narcotic jihad’. “Those who are eager to create division would try to exploit such statements,” Rajendran said in an indirect dig at the BJP and Sangh Parivar. The CPI state secretary said there was no need for a probe into the concerns expressed by the bishop and added that every political party can have its own opinion on such matters. Kerala Congress chairman Jose K Mani had justified the bishop on the issue. ‘Jose K Mani, Mercykutty Amma unpopular’CPI found fault with KC(M) and CPM in its poll analysis report passed by the state council, which concluded on Saturday. The report said the unpopularity of Jose K Mani among people and unacceptability among a section of LDF workers led to his defeat in Pala. The report also attributed to the ‘behavioural issues’ of J Mercykutty Amma as the reason for LDF losing Kundara seat. “While people were unhappy over the haughtiness of Mercykutty Amma, UDF candidate P C Vishnunath appeared a humbler and more acceptable candidate,” the report said. It took a dig at CPM when it said the internal issues in CPM brought down K N Balagopal’s victory margin in Kottarakkara seat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/no-rift-in-cpi-over-raja-issue-kanam/articleshow/86181478.cms||---

---||Ahmedabad||Per capita petrol sales fall by 8kg in Gujarat||AHMEDABAD: Petroleum product sales took a beating in 2020-21 with commuters’ mobility getting curtailed due to the lockdown and subsequent restrictions on travel and curfews to check the spread of Covid-19. The per capita sales of motor spirit (MS) or petrol in Gujarat declined by 8kg (approximately 10 litres) in the last financial year, shows provisional data compiled by the petroleum planning and analysis cell (PPAC) of the Union ministry of petroleum and natural gas. The per capita sales of petrol for the state plummeted to 26.2kg in fiscal 2020-21 from 34.2kg in 2019-20, according to the PPAC reports. The sales include petrol sold for passenger cars, taxies, two and three wheelers. In absolute terms, the petrol sales stood at 18.60 lakh tonnes in April 2020-March 2021, which showed a drop of 10% over 20.66 lakh tonnes of petrol sold in April 2019-March 2020. Thanks to the pandemic-induced lockdown coupled with restrictions on travel as well as most people working from home, the overall consumption of petrol has gone down, said industry players. “Most people continued to work out of home, while schools and educational institutions were shut too, due to which the overall vehicular movement declined in 2020-21. Therefore, the consumption of fuel was expected to take a hit. In 2020-21, the petrol consumption declined by an estimated 8%,” said Dhimant Ghelani, general secretary, Federation of Gujarat Petroleum Dealers’ Association (FGPDA). “The demand situation has slightly improved as of now but overall decline in sale continues to remain as educational institutions are yet to fully resume operations and outstation travel is yet to pick up in full swing,” Ghelani added. Petrol price stood at Rs 98.04 per litre on Monday whereas diesel cost Rs 95.49 per litre. Meanwhile, high-speed diesel (HSD) sales also dropped 9% to 50.89 lakh tonnes in 2020-21 from 56.07 lakh tonnes in the previous fiscal. The per capita sales came down to 71.7kg in FY21 from 92.9kg in FY20, the PPAC reports further state. HSD is used as fuel in commercial vehicles, trucks, buses, private vehicles and pumps in agriculture sector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/per-capita-petrol-sales-fall-by-8kg/articleshow/86181476.cms||Kalpesh Damor

---||Ahmedabad||Jab for kids: 26% of parents wary||Ahmedabad: While several countries including Spain, France, the Netherlands, Germany, and the US have already started vaccinating minors against Covid-19, India is likely to offer the shots soon. Against this backdrop, a team of researchers from IIPH Gandhinagar (IIPH-G) carried out a perception survey among parents on their willingness to have their children vaccinated. The study’s results showed that 43% of the respondents overall and 27% in Gujarat specifically were not willing to have their children vaccinated. The survey was carried out by 28 students led by Shubham Sharma, Anjali Vincent, and Sonal Mehta and covered 290 parents from eight states including Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, and Tripura. “When we intend to open schools, vaccination of the kids will be a major question. Thus, we asked the parents about their willingness and the reasons for it,” said Sharma. “The respondents were in five categories which had high public interaction. We also got the history of Covid transmission in their households.” The study highlighted that non-willingness was higher in other states. Much of the hesitancy was attributed to factors such as misconceptions, fear, and a lack of knowledge. A parent said that his wife got Covid despite taking the first dose. Thus, he did not believe it was effective. Another said that of the three kids, he will vaccinate one first to see if it has any ill-effects. “He said that hospitalization results in huge expenses, and thus he wanted to be cautious,” said a researcher.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/jab-for-kids-26-of-parents-wary/articleshow/86181487.cms||---

When this continued for several days, he had to go to LMC’s zonal office to deposit tax. Like Kukerja, several property owners are having a hard time in depositing their property tax online due to glitches in LMC’s website. Taxpayers can directly pay their property tax by visiting the official website (lmc.nic.in) and clicking on the property tax payment option. They have to enter their unique house ID and password before payment. However, residents complain that paying tax online is turning out to be more cumbersome than offline option due to technical glitches. Prasoon Verma of Alambagh said, “I received a link on my smartphone from the civic body which directly took me to the option of paying tax online. However, it took at least 15 minutes for tax payment option to load. I tried for at least eight times before I could submit tax. It was so cumbersome that going to zonal office to pay the tax seemed easier.” Not only the payment option but taxpayers who want to register their contact number to obtain a unique house ID and messages from the civic body are facing similar problems. LMC chief tax collection officer, Ashok Singh, said: “There are some complaints regarding online property tax collection option. The problem will be resolved soon.” TIMES VIEW Online payment of tax is not only easy for residents but also advisable in times of Covid-19 pandemic to avoid overcrowding at collection counters.

Announcing the decision, IUML national president KM Kader Mohideen said Thahiliya was removed for grave indiscipline on the recommendation of IUML Kerala state committee. But, former state secretary of Haritha Mina Jaleel said the action against Thahiliya was anti-democratic and a display of arrogance. The action comes days after IUML disbanded the state committee of Haritha, who had filed a complaint with the women’s commission against three MSF leaders, including state president PK Navas, for making anti-women and sexually-coloured remarks against their leaders. IUML took disciplinary action against Thahiliya for the public support she extended to the former state committee of Haritha. Thahiliya, also the founding general secretary of Haritha, was the first among MSF leaders to express solidarity with the women leaders and had publicly said that natural justice was denied to Haritha leaders when IUML initially froze the committee in August. She had said that following the incident, she and leaders of Haritha were being subjected to heinous form of character assassination, vulgar comments and falsehood on social media which was causing mental trauma. Though IUML revoked the decision to freeze the state committee later as part of a ‘reconciliation’ pact, Haritha leaders stood firm against withdrawing their complaint, following which IUML, on Sept 8, dissolved the state committee. After the party announced a new state committee on Sunday, Thahiliya had said that she had differences of opinion over the way in which the new committee was announced. Even as IUML state general secretary PMA Salam said on Monday that Haritha issue was a closed chapter, the issue continued to smoulder in MSF with vice-president PP Shaijal saying that the former Haritha state committee leaders hadn’t received justice. He added that the new office-bearers of Haritha were announced without consultations with the MSF state leadership.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/iuml-removes-fathima-from-msf-national-vp-post/articleshow/86181518.cms||---

He said that the original decision was to distribute 12,000 land titles, but a larger number was possible after the complexities in preparing the titles were resolved. “The LDF government’s policy is to provide land to all the landless along with providing them housing facilities. Between 2016 and 2021, the LDF government could distribute 1.75 lakh land titles, which is an all-time record,” he said. The aim of the present LDF government is to provide land titles to maximum eligible citizens in the next five years, he added. The chief minister said that the government will revise and expand the policy of providing Rs 10 lakh for land and house, and will also ensure that one acre agricultural land is provided to each of the tribal families. For this purpose, the government will utilize the barren land, surplus land and the plantations for which the lease period has expired. He said that now the clearance for providing a unique thandaper number will help the government in finding those holding more land than the permissible limit and take action against them. “A land bank will be formed to provide land for the landless. A digital resurvey also will be conducted and the government has granted Rs 339 crore for the Rebuild Kerala Initiative (RKI) for the purpose. The resurvey will be completed in four years. Through the digital resurvey, it is expected that the government will be able to find more land for distribution among the landless,” the CM said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/govt-will-distribute-13-5k-land-titles-says-vijayan/articleshow/86181578.cms||---

The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) has estimated vaccination of around 1,400 pregnant women admitted to various hospitals or undergoing regular check-ups at maternity homes. So far, 341 pregnant women have been jabbed at KMC’s Panchaganga hospital, where special sessions of vaccination for pregnant women are held every Monday. Pregnant women can approach any vaccination centre at any time of the week to get the jab. However, such women are not registered under the ‘pregnant women’ category but as beneficiaries between the 18 to 44 age group. Amol Mane, KMC’s vaccination nodal officer, said, “In last two to three weeks, the turnout of pregnant women for special session at Panchaganga hospital has increased. We have set the target of next two months to complete the vaccination of all registered pregnant women.” Civic authorities claim that the turnout of pregnant women for vaccination in Kolhapur city is quite satisfactory since at many places, especially in rural areas, women still have doubts regarding vaccination. Mane said the KMC is making the pregnant women who have received the vaccination as example for other pregnant women to get jabbed. The pregnant women have doubts regarding their own safety and the safety of their foetus. “We have a miniscule number of pregnant women who showed any adverse effects after getting vaccinated. It is quite safe for pregnant women and her foetus to get jabbed. Also in one jab both the foetus and the mother can get protection from Covid infection,” added Mane.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/kolhapur-city-341-pregnant-women-got-covid-jabs/articleshow/86176693.cms||---

The statement comes in the backdrop of the controversy over ‘narcotic jihad’ remark by Pala bishop Joseph Kallarangatt of Syro-Malabar Church. However, the statement doesn’t directly refer to the issue or the remark by the bishop. The statement said that those in positions have the responsibility to lead their people on the right track and the right to execute that duty should not be curtailed. The beliefs and practices of other religions should not be questioned either, the statement said. “Some wrong practices exist in society. Wrongs should be corrected by understanding the realities, analyzing the truth and scrutinizing the wrongs. No one should take to the streets and indulge in mudslinging instead of doing this,” said the statement. He said in the statement that all religions should have a leadership which can carefully study issues and make their people understand it. He further said that all religious leaders have the duty to ensure an approach that will not create any troubles for others even as they stick to their ideologies. Meanwhile, KCBC Temperance council of Pala diocese, a body working under the Church’s Temperance commission on Monday announced that they will form ‘Anti-Narcotic Jagrta’ cells to fight the increase in drug and alcohol usage and related developments. The council condemned the alleged misinterpretations of the warning issued by the Pala Bishop. The council said in a statement that no one needs to dictate the bishop on what to preach to the faithful.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/end-row-that-can-affect-communal-harmony-of-state/articleshow/86181650.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The police reacted to a tweet that showed the man standing on the railing of a flyover, and without wasting time, saved him before he could take the drastic step.  The man works for an online food delivery portal and was planning to end his life following financial struggles, senior police officers said. The matter came to light around 6 pm, when Congress functionary Alka Lamba tweeted a video showing a man standing on the railing of a flyover in Andrews Ganj area. The station house officer of Kotla Mubarakpur police station rushed to the spot along with his patrolling team and beat staff. “The team found that one male person aged about 40 years was standing near the flyover iron railing preparing to jump. He was also loudly saying that he is disappointed in his life and wanted to end it. The police team tried to pacify him. Meanwhile, a team was deployed under the flyover with a net to save the man from hitting the ground in case he jumped,” said deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Thakur. “Our team members on the flyover cleverly engaged him in talks, inched closer to him and managed to catch him before he could react. He was then brought down from the flyover. During questioning, he disclosed his identity as a resident of Almorah, Uttarakhand. He was later handed over to his relative,” the officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/police-avert-suicide-bid-by-42-year-old/articleshow/86181635.cms||---

The last time the city achieved this feat was 528 days ago, on April 2, 2020, when the pandemic had just reared its head. To put it in perspective, at 2.38 lakh total cases and 3,411 deaths, Ahmedabad was the most affected area of Gujarat with the highest Covid cases and deaths during the pandemic. In the beginning of the pandemic, it was one of the worst-affected districts in India that had prompted a central team of experts to visit the city and hold meetings with state administration. For the past two months, the city has seldom recorded daily cases in double digits. There have been fewer deaths, too. Dr Bharat Gadhvi, president of Ahmedabad Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (AHNA), said that for the past 10 days, city hospitals have not seen a single Covid case, whereas cases are few and far over the past 40 days. Dr Rakesh Joshi, medical superintendent of Civil Hospital, said that for the past one month, no direct Covid cases are being admitted to the hospital. “The 3-4 patients we have are suspects with similar symptoms, and generally get treated for the symptoms. In the past two months, we have had three zero days with no new patients. I congratulate Amdavadis for the feat and urge them to remain extra vigilant to eradicate Covid,” he said. Experts said major get-togethers during festivities must be avoided and protocols followed. “Vaccination has also done its part in reducing the cases and severity,” said Dr Gadhvi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/after-528-days-city-sees-0-cases-in-24-hrs/articleshow/86181623.cms||---

Chances are that you have been offered a fake profile after matching your requirements. After arresting a Civil Line resident, Lalit Kumar, who was running a fraud marriage bureau in the city, the Ludhiana police have asked residents to be vigilant and avoid sharing details and making payments without verification as there are no records of registered marriage bureaux in the city.

According to the police, the accused have duped people of at least Rs 25 lakh in the past two years.Accused women, identified as Amanpreet Kaur of Amarpura and Sonia of Civil Lines, were getting fixed salaries for the job. Amanpreet has been working for main accused Lalit Kumar for the past two years and Sonia joined them about seven months ago.Additional deputy commissioner of police (crime) Rupinder Kaur Bhatti said, “It was a fraud marriage bureau. The accused have not made even one match as they never used genuine profiles. They would scan all the matrimonial advertisements and as per the requirement of the match-seeker, make a fake profile and share it with them. They also misused pictures of people available on different social media websites. The accused earned Rs 1 lakh to 1.5 lakh every month.”The accused used to charge Rs 3,000 to Rs 10,000 from people, depending on the clients’ profile.The ADCP added, “Since there is no record of registered and genuine marriage bureaux, the police urge people not to share any information or transfer money without verification. The accused used to lure people with the matches and after getting money transferred to their accounts, they switched off their phone. People must visit the office of the marriage bureau first. The police will also make people aware of it.”Inspector Jatinder Singh, in charge of cyber cell-II, said, “The police have also recovered 77 SIM cards, 11 mobiles and two laptops. All SIM cards have been issued on different IDs. Even the bank account used for transactions is in the name of a Delhi resident, Sahil Sharma.

Nitin Gadkari, union minister of road transport and highways, has taken a decision to deploy the team of experts in hydraulic and road engineering. The team will arrive in next 15 days. Recently, Raju Shetti, leader of Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghtana met Gadkari and said the concrete elevations or solid bridges made along NH-48 — especially in Kolhapur, Satara and Belagavi districts — causes obstructions to flood water. “The bridges along the highway are constructed with solid concrete elevations for a stretch of around two kilometers at some places. Many experts have suggested to do away with these structures and replace them with pillars. Situation of flood aggravates due to these solid structures. The floodwater does not recede due to these obstructions. The river water needs to be free flowing to avoid flooding,” Shetti said. Similar request has been made by the state government to the central government. The six laning work of the highway has been undertaken. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar during his visit to Kolhapur after July floods had said he will request Gadkari to consider the modifications in the highway structure in the six laning project itself. “The minister has assured to send a team of experts to study the effect the concrete structures on floods. The work to replace the solid structures by pillars is expensive and therefore the feasibility study needs to be carried out,” said Shetti. During the floods in 2019 and this year in July, the national highway stretch from Kolhapur city to Shiroli was shut for over a fortnight due to inundation. The elevations on both sides caused and it led to no traffic movement during floods. It has also found that the solid bridges cause trouble during rescuing the flood-affected citizens.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/experts-to-study-effect-of-concrete-bridge-elevations-along-nh-48-on-floods/articleshow/86176766.cms||---

He asked the government not to be a scarecrow on the issue when in a situation where fake IDs are used to spread hatred in social media. “All attempts to encourage hatred and animosity should be opposed. At present, the state is witnessing a very sensitive situation of creating rift among the communities and this is the agenda of the Sangh Parivar. Police should have a close tab on the social media and track the people who are engaged in spreading hatred,” Satheesan said. If the church heads have a complaint on this, then they should approach the authorities. The only request to the communities is that they should not fall prey to the propagandas of the Sangh Parivar. If the church is forwarding any concerns, then the police should act. The church leaders should hand over the evidences they have in this regard, he added. It would not be advisable for different communities to challenge each other during such sensitive situation and the government should not remain as a scarecrow without taking any steps to end the row. “The CPM should not take a position that let the communities fight each other. Their silence on this episode is signalling to this stand,” said Satheesan. He asked all the cultural leaders and intellectuals to come out campaigning for communal harmony in the state. They should not allow these people to destabilize the peace and harmony exists in the state. There are several sections of people who are trying to exploit the situation and the people together should resist any such attempts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/govt-inactive-in-checking-hate-campaigns-satheesan/articleshow/86181704.cms||---

He also reminded them that the Punjab government has always supported them and their agitation. “Farmers are trying to stop people. Punjab is one state which has supported farmers and their movement,” Amarinder said. “It’s your own Punjab, please don’t spoil things here. Let those protesting in Delhi and Haryana keep doing that. You do there, why should you protest in Punjab? Punjab needs development and I expect that they would agree with me and would not allow anything wrong here,” Amarinder said, adding, “In Punjab farmers are sitting at 113 places. It’s actually causing a loss to Punjab. Why should the economy of Punjab be damaged?”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/dont-hold-stir-in-punjab-capt-to-farmers/articleshow/86186343.cms||IP Singh

The couple from Sant Kabir Nagar had allegedly eloped in December 2020. They were traced in Thane (Maharashtra) and were being brought back to their native district by a police team on September 10.

Both of them sustained grievous injuries and the girl succumbed on September 11. Police said the man had two children from his first marriage and after his wife's death, he developed an affair with the girl and the couple moved to Thane with the children. Superintendent of police, Sant Kabir Nagar, Kaustubh, told TOI that the circle officer of Ghanghata has been directed to probe the incident. Preliminary investigations revealed that three policemen, including sub-inspector Amit Chaturvedi and two constables, were entrusted with the responsibility of bringing back the couple. “After the incident came to light, a GRP unit recovered them and admitted them to a local hospital where the girl was declared dead.

The potholes have not only slowed down vehicular traffic, but are also leading to petty accidents with bikers reported to be falling down while riding past their two-wheelers over them. Such pothole-ridden roads can be seen at Dwarka, Panchavati, Ambad Link Road, Satpur, Gangapur Road, Shalimar and Nashik Road. “At places such as Datta Mandir in Nashik Road, the potholes are so huge that they are like craters. They are nearly a feet deep. Motorists speed their vehicles over the potholes and many bikers fall down, just to catch the green signal at the junction located a few metres away,” said Mukesh Pasbola, resident of Nashik Road. Damage to the vehicles is another problem due to the potholes, said many citizens. Mayur Jawale of Untawadi said that the Nashik Municipal Corporation should make the roads of concrete wherever possible. “There are certain pockets in the Cidco area, where the problem of potholes is perennial. Year after year, the roads are asphalted but when the rains arrive, the situation is back to square one,” he said. Meanwhile, bikers have again started to skidding on the Mumbai-Agra highway near Dwarka owing to the slush that has started to accumulate on the highway. While the traffic police state that the mud from the plantation in the divider of the road gets spread on the main carriage way, senior officials of NHAI said that it was not the case. Sajan Sonawane of the city traffic branch said police personnel are deployed in the area. “If we see that bikers have started falling from the slushy road, we simply close the road for vehicular traffic and divert it on to the service road. On Saturday, we had to close the road beneath the flyover near Dwarka for vehicular traffic for some time and divert the traffic.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/motorists-suffer-rough-rides-on-rain-hit-nashik-city-roads/articleshow/86176952.cms||Santosh Sonawane

BJP’s national executive member P K Krishnadas and state vice-president A N Radhakrishnan held talks with the bishop on Monday. After meeting the bishop, Krishnadas told reporters that this was not an issue between two religions but something very serious which will affect the whole country. He also said that it is the agenda of terrorist organizations to make it appear this as an issue between two religions. The approaches of the chief minister and the opposition leader are helping implement that agenda. Both Congress and CPM are supportive of such terrorist stands, which is very dangerous, he said. He said that the ruling front and the opposition remaining close to terrorists will create a serious setback. Church’s concerns must be discussed, says Surendran Meanwhile, BJP state president K Suendran endorsed the ‘narcotic jihad’ allegation raised by the bishop and said that the society should discuss the concerns of the church. Surendran told reporters on Monday that it was not possible to remain a spectator while the bishop is being attacked from all sides. “Society should discuss what the bishop has said. Also, the learned men in the Muslim community should come forward to support the bishop and hold open discussions,” Surendran said. He also said that goonda gangs from Erattupetta will not be allowed to attack the bishop. Surendran also attacked both chief minister and opposition leader saying that both went against the bishop fearing some persons. “They should facilitate talks and hold an investigation into the concerns raised by the bishop,” he said. Surendran said that the bishop’s protection should be ensured.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/bjp-leaders-visit-pala-bishop-extend-support/articleshow/86181803.cms||---

It should also allocate more funds for mental health care as more people are suffering from mental illness.A division bench of Justice N Kirubakaran (who has since retired after signing the order) and Justice B Pugalendhi observed that World Health Organization calls India the most depressed country in the world. Hence, it is the duty of the Centre along with all state governments to have a comprehensive action plan to identify patients with mental illness and provide appropriate treatment. A periodical survey should be conducted for this purpose.Since there is an acute shortage of psychiatrists and child psychiatrists in the country, the judges said all medical colleges should have a department of psychiatry with a postgraduate course in it. “The concept of having only mental hospitals to provide psychiatric care is an outdated one. Now, it is believed that a majority of persons with mental illnesses can be managed in the community or through outpatient care,” the judges said while calling for efforts to have a psychiatrist in all taluk headquarters hospitals.The judges observed that Karnataka has devised digital monitoring mechanisms to oversee district mental health programme and implementation of Mental Healthcare Act, 2017. The Centre and other state governments have to follow this system.The judges also said taboo/social stigma attached to those with mental illness prevents people from taking proper treatment. The stigma attached to mental illness should be dispelled through awareness plans.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/set-up-mental-health-institutions-in-every-zone-hc-tells-centre/articleshow/86181750.cms||Kaushik Kannan

A division bench of Justice N Kirubakaran (since retired after signing the order) and Justice B Pugalendhi also directed the Centre to revisit the priority list for medical admission of wards of armed forces personnel. Equal importance must be given to all categories by distributing the available seats uniformly. “Scorching sun and freezing cold do not deter our border forces from safeguarding our nation. Our forces spend sleepless nights in the borders to make us sleep safely and securely inside our homes,” the judges observed. However, it is shocking to note that Tamil Nadu government omitted the special reservation for wards of serving defence personnel for medical admissions. A GO passed by the government in 1979 allotted six seats (two each) to wards of ex-servicemen, deceased defence personnel and serving defence personnel. The defence ministry in 2018 issued a notification giving inter-se priority for reservation in medical admission for wards of armed forces under nine categories. Though it speaks about wards of serving personnel in the eighth category, the state government in the 2018 GO retained the priority list only up to sixth and deleted the other three categories including wards of serving personnel. No justification was given by the government for this, the judges said. The 1979 GO is capable of doing justice to all sections of defence personnel. Disposing of an appeal by the state government, the judges upheld the order of a single bench granting relief to the ward of a serving defence personnel, by quashing the portion of the GO which denies special reservation benefits to wards of serving defence personnel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/allot-1-medical-seats-to-wards-of-defence-personnel-says-hc/articleshow/86181768.cms||Kaushik Kannan

The committee will undertake a seat-wise assessment of the applications in the presence of office-bearers at the state, district and Vidhan Sabha levels. It will then send tentative names to the screening committee which may undertake further pruning. The final list will be sent to the Congress central election committee which will announce the names. The three-layer process has been introduced to ensure that the best person is selected, said a senior functionary. “The process indicates transparency in the selection process. It is also being done to ensure that there is no last-minute chaos and any chance of infighting is ruled out,” said a senior state-level functionary. The 50-member committee includes party biggies like Salman Khurshid, RPN Singh, Rashid Alvi, Rashid Masood and so on. A list of 38 such leaders has already been issued. The remaining are departmental and unit heads of UP. Earlier, the election committee of UP Congress had handed over the final power to finalise candidates to Priyanka, who formulated this process. Priyanka had assured the organizational officials that their opinion will be considered.

According to sources, the PM is expected to announce courses related to defence studies and training at the university as it would help students from the region to get absorbed in units being set up in Defence Corridor between Chitrakoot and Aligarh, extending to Bulandshahar in the west and Lucknow in central UP. The PM’s address is likely to focus on the Jat king and his contribution to the region, said experts. The PM’s visit comes at a time when the opposition and farmers’ unions are trying to win over the Jats who form a sizeable population in the region.  Jat dominance in UP is seen till Mathura though Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh had contested the Lok Sabha election from Mathura in 1957 defeating Jan Sangh candidate and former Prime Minister late Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

The development potentially marks ruling BJP's overt attempt to win over the Jat community -- which account forRaja Mahendra Pratap Singh, an alumnus of the Mohammedan Anglo-Oriental (MAO) College, which later became Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), had given 3.04 acre land to the university on lease for the construction of a school in 1929. He donated land to various educational institutions, including AMU. Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh (ANI Photo)Experts believe that the idea behind setting up of the Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh University could be to create another centre of education parallel to Aligarh Muslim University, a centrally-administered institution. During his 2017 election campaign, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had said, “Mahendra Pratap Singh had given land for the purpose of establishing the university but his name has not been mentioned on any plaque.” He had also promised to set up another university in the name of the Jat leader. The region is crucial for the BJP as it has always been at the centrestage due to its vocal and dominant Jat community. After the Muzaffarnagar riots, Jats shifted loyalty towards the BJP giving it an upper hand in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and in 2017 assembly election after pre-poll cajoling of the community. However, in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Jats showed some disenchantment giving the BJP sleepless nights and last-minute political manoeuvring. Preparations under way ahead of PM Modi's visit to lay the foundation stone of the Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh UniversityAhead of the UP assembly elections, the BJP once again wants to win back Jats at a time when the Bharatiya Kisan Union, led by a Jat leader Rakesh Tikait, is trying to leave an impact on the community by raking up farmers’ issues. The BJP think-tank, however, believes that the PM’s speech around the Jat king would help the party in its outreach plan. On the development front, the PM is expected to inaugurate the Aligarh node of the defence corridor as several companies have signed agreements to set up their units.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/pm-visit-to-bolster-bjps-efforts-to-woo-jats/articleshow/86184102.cms||Rajiv Srivastava
---||Bhopal||166 cases in 2 weeks in MP: September spurt surpasses Covid’s August average||BHOPAL: In past 13 days of September, a total of 166 new Covid-19 cases have been reported in 15 districts of the state. No new cases were reported from rest 37 districts in the same duration. The number averages to around 13 cases everyday and if there is neither growth or decline in the rate, around 415 new Covid-19 cases will be reported in this month. In August, only 347 Covid-19 cases were reported in 31 days which averaged to around 10 cases a day. There is a mild but apparent increase in the number of cases so far this month. Of the 166 cases reported so far this month, 65 have been reported from Jabalpur alone. Jabalpur was the first district of Madhya Pradesh to report Covid-19 cases in March 2020. Apart from Jabalpur, it is Indore (28 cases) and Bhopal (27 cases) that have reported maximum cases. Sagar reported 12 cases while Dhar and Rajgarh districts reported six new cases each in the duration. Sources said that less number of cases could be attributed to the fact that majority of the new cases reported are asymptomatic and as people are not having any problems, it is less likely that they are going for tests. Like in Gwalior, there are two active cases right now and both have been fully vaccinated. Asymptomatic, they got themselves tested primarily because they had to travel and the destination required negative RT-PCR report. In Jabalpur, officials said they are doing random tests. It is also a cause leading to increase in number of cases. The district administration has taken several measures, including orders under section 144 making masks mandatory and not allowing home isolation of patients, added sources. As several experts are saying it is possible that the third wave is already in but it will be less severe, vaccination coverage could be one of the reasons that had led to control of situation, as nearly 75% of the eligible population in MP has received at least first dose. The government has set a target to vaccine everyone with at least first dose by this month-end.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/166-cases-in-2-wks-sept-spurt-surpasses-covids-aug-average/articleshow/86181812.cms||Amarjeet Singh

Addressing the members of Crisis Management Groups from across the state through video conferencing he appealed to the people not to lower guard against the deadly virus. He also sought the cooperation of all in containing dengue and to behave in a manner that festivals are also celebrated and at the same time that Coronavirus doesn't spread. “A lot of Corona cases are still being reported from Maharashtra and Kerala and we must remain vigilant and cautious so as to be able to avert the third wave at all costs,” Chouhan said. Making a fervent appeal to people to get vaccinated for protection against Coronavirus, he said they should also continue to stick to the Covid protocol, which they seem to be forgetting after the Covid-19 cases dropped in the state. He appealed to members of the Crisis Management Groups from district to panchayat level across Madhya Pradesh to reach out to help the state government mobilise people for vaccination so that the first dose of the vaccine is administered to all the eligible persons by September 26 and also prevail upon them to observe Covid appropriate behaviour. Taking names of districts where vaccination rate has been lower than 70%, he said that vaccination is a must, those who have not come for vaccination should be personally contacted and brought to vaccination centres much. “Reach out to them and tell them that vaccination is important for their own as well as other people also,” he said. He said that 1.30 crore people have not taken the first dose and another 70 lakh are not turning up for the second dose even after the due date for the purpose.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/dont-ignore-even-small-rise-in-covid-cases-shivraj-urges-crisis-mgmt-team/articleshow/86181798.cms||---

He urged those in the public domain to understand the apprehensions of the Christian minorities and discuss them with an open mind. He urged the political parties and media to correct their discriminative policies on this issue. He said that the possibility of Kerala becoming a major market for narcotics after Taliban came to power in Afghanistan is very high. Both love and narcotic terrorism goes together. All should try to eliminate such threats. The detached attitude of those in power in this issue will put the future of the country in danger, the archbishop said. The archbishop urged the state and the Centre to consider this situation with utmost seriousness. Defending bishop Kallarangatt, the archbishop said the Church cannot remain silent when forces tighten their grips against the security of families. “That is why bishop Kallarangatt cautioned about some dangers and asked the faithful to be alert. Certain elements which ruin families are emerging strong in the society in recent times,” said the archbishop. The families in Kerala are facing varied and serious threats. Cases of sexual abuse and suicides are on the rise. The archbishop also said that minor girls, women and homemakers fall victims in these cases.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/church-cant-remain-silent-towards-social-evils/articleshow/86181844.cms||---

He was more than happy to give the part of the land.” The MSEDCL had got sanctioned a 33/11 kv substation for the villages around Khirvire in the tribal-dominated taluka of Akole under phase two of the High Voltage Distribution System (HVDS). However, the company was unable to get any land at the rate, they were offering. The officials were looking to shift the proposal to some other location when some locals suggested that the company can approach Rathod for help. Rathod, who has his construction business in Kalyan, said, “I had bought some land there and planned to construct my house. I know the villagers and I have seen their hardships. If a substation is constructed there for the rural population, it is my social responsibility to help the people there.” When pointed out that he parted his land only at the payment of Re 1, he said it didn’t matter to him as it would benefit the village.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/bizman-gives-part-of-his-land-for-power-utility/articleshow/86176980.cms||Abhilash Botekar

The taluka had received 126 mm of rainfall on the night of September 6, after which a bridge was washed away. Three more bridges in the town were also affected as the approach roads were washed away. The council started the cleanliness activity from September 7 itself with the staff borrowed from other municipal councils and Malegaon Municipal Corporation. “Though our own sanitary workers were not available on Wednesday for carrying out the cleanliness activities in the town as their homes were also affected due to water, we got staff from other councils and started collecting garbage from the day one,” said Vivek Dhande, the chief officer of the town. The council received 16 cleanliness workers from Manmad council for two days, 22 staff for one day from Yeola and 60 from Malegaon corporation for one day. Two fire tenders from Malegaon for one day and one fire tender from Manmad for three days were also provided to Nandgaon, all of which was used for washing off the muck in the town. “Currently we are dumping the entire waste in a section of the town and spraying over it to ensure it does not create any health hazards. The exercise will continue for some time till a solution is worked out,” the officer said. The officer added that cleaning work was being carried daily but continuous rainfall and washing of homes was bringing mud on the roads.

---||Lucknow||Live in sync with nature to keep illnesses away||By Dr Harsh SharmaThe Covid-19 pandemic has brought India’s environment-sensitive philosophy of life back in focus. And while health agencies of the world prescribe a way of life encouraged in the scriptures, many may not be aware of how the presently popular survival mantras may hold their genesis to ancient wisdom. The Vedas, Puranas and Upanishads contain the earliest messages of preservation of environment for ecological balance. They place the five elements of nature—earth, water, air, light and cosmos—above everything else and tell humans to live in sync with them. Likewise, the Bhagavad Gita advises not to try to change the environment, improve it, or wrestle with it even when it turns hostile and prescribes people to tolerate the upheaval and improvise self to survive the change. They state that earth is not a territory to be conquered and forbade humans from exploiting nature as divinity prevails in all elements, including plants and animals. Diseases as an outcome of meddling with natureThere is no dearth of examples to prove that meddling with nature creates a breeding ground for diseases. This adds to the need and importance of living in harmony with nature. The Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) was unknown to human race before 1959. It is widely believed that HIV originated in Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo around 1970 when HIV crossed species from chimpanzee, a wild animal, though there was no need to disturb their habitat for any reason. Not just these, many infectious diseases of recent concern, including malaria, influenza, dengue, Japanese encephalitis and Covid-19 have emerged from complex ecological communities involving multiple hosts and their associated parasites. Some of them are influenced by human impacts on the environment, for example intensive agriculture, deforestation, habitat loss, contamination of air, water and soil. The biggest culprit perhaps is the degradation of forest cover that displaces an entire biota of flora, fauna, microbes, insects and animals and compels them to interact with the human population which may sooner or later lead to emergence of new diseases in humans. Ebola virus, for instance, was a tragic medical event which happened in Africa and which caused much human mortality and morbidity. It was suspected to be an animal-transmitted disease i.e. it was transmitted from bats to apes, monkeys before hitting humans. The unmindful mingling with nature may alter in unanticipated ways the structure and composition of ecological communities. Despite a lot of advancement in understanding and management of these diseases, morbidity and mortality incurred are still sporadically higher in many parts of the world, especially in low and middle-income countries. Connected world aids spread of diseases: The current pandemic crisis caused by the SARS-CoV-19 virus has proved how fast diseases can spread and alter life forever. Unless the race for development stops and rethinks to come up with ways that are in sync with nature, future pandemics cannot be averted. Individuals, governments, societies, groups and communities will have to come forward and understand that the very existence and well-being of human race directly depends upon healthy equilibrium between humans and environment.

Of late, the frequency of seizures has increased despite medications. Through a brain MRI done to assess the severity of the disease, he was found to have AVM of size 4.1 X 4.8 cm nidus in right parieto occipital area,” the dean said.Subsequently, high precision stereotactic radiotherapy was planned for the patient as otherwise extensive surgery was needed, which also involved longer stay and more morbidity. “At the Regional Cancer Centre, we have a linear accelerator machine - TrueBeam, which can deliver radiation in a targeted manner sparing the normal tissues. Stereotactic radiation treatment was given to the patient, for which he had good response and reduction in the number of seizure episodes,” said Dr Rathinavel.The procedure was carried out with the support of professor and head Dr P K Baskar, department of radiation oncology, associate professor Dr K Mahalakshmi Prasad, assistant professors, radiation physics team, staff nurses, technicians and other staff at the RCC.The dean further said that through stereotactic radiotherapy, inoperable brain tumour, lung cancer and cancer of other regions can be treated as well as conditions such as arteriovenous malformation, pituitary microadenoma, meningioma etc. The public can make use of these facilities free of cost under the Chief Minister's Comprehensive Health Insurance Scheme.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/grh-treats-patient-with-brain-disorder-through-stereotactic-radiotherapy/articleshow/86181897.cms||---

However, an alert has been issued to the people staying along the banks and even those who have shops and establishments there. Due to the good rainfall in the catchment area of Gangapur dam, it is filled to 98% of its total capacity,” officials from district administration said. The India Meteorological Department (IMD), meanwhile, has sounded an ‘orange’ alert (warning extremely heavy rainfall at isolated places in ghat areas) for Tuesday. This means the rainfall likely to be more than 60 mm in 24 hours. “It is raining and hence to be on the safer side, we have moved our kiosks from the banks. This is our annual exercise and we are now used to it,” Santosh Kokate, one of the vendors, said. A stationary car, parked on the Godavari banks at Ramkund, got half submerged in the river water as the flow increased. However, timely action by the locals and the NMC helped in rescuing the vehicle. Nashik has been getting steady rain for over two days and in the last 24 hours ending 8.30am on Monday, Nashik’s average rainfall was 260 mm with talukas like Igatpuri (93 mm), Trimbakeshwar (60) and Peth (90 mm) getting the bulk of the rain. The good rains have resulted in adding to the storages in major and medium dams. While three dams still have water storages less than 50% of their capacities, water from ten dams has started overflowing. The average water levels across all 23 dams are at 74% only. Water is being released from Gangapur dam, Darna dam (10,060 cusec), Kadva 2,200 cusec from Nashik district into the catchment area of Jayakwadi dam.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/alert-along-godavari-bank-as-water-level-rises-at-ramkund/articleshow/86177053.cms||---

This will be the second bone bank to be established in the state at a government tertiary care centre after the one functioning at Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital in Chennai.The bone bank will be established at the Trauma Care Centre (TCC) block of the GRH at a cost of Rs 40 lakh. GRH dean Dr A Rathinavel said that the plan to establish a bone bank at GRH has been long pending and the work has started. Head of the department of orthopaedics at GRH, Dr R Arivasan, explained that through the bone bank, bone tissue would be harvested from cadavers and preserved to be later used for transplantation procedures. Apart from cadavers, in some cases bone tissues could also be harvested from living donors if a patient’s bone tissues are near amputation or require removal.“Like for any other organ, bone tissue will be harvested through a careful procedure and radiation will be done for the soft tissue surrounding it. The bones can then be preserved at -70 or -80 degree Celsius for use for transplantation,” said the doctor. He said that bone bank is mainly useful for bone tumour patients and that limb salvage procedures are being planned wherein the damaged bone tissue is removed and transplanted with the harvested bone tissue.Dr Arivasan further said that the harvested bone tissues are also used in various other orthopaedic procedures, which involve loss of bone tissue. “In sports injuries, harvested bone tissue is useful for transplantations, especially in cases where we use bone graft from the same patient (autograft),” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-grh-to-set-up-bone-bank-this-year-at-rs-40-lakh/articleshow/86181878.cms||---

Much bonhomie was on display between the new CM and the former CM and the outgoing deputy CM before Monday’s swearing-in ceremony. Bhupendra Patel called on both Vijay Rupani and Nitin Patel at their residences on Monday morning and spent time with them before taking oath as the CM. There was warmth in both the meetings as Rupani and Nitin Patel asserted that they were happy with the choice of Bhupendra Patel as the CM and had personally endorsed his name for the post. “I was a common man during my tenure as the CM and will continue to be one,” remarked Rupani in Gandhinagar. A government statement said that Rupani and Bhupendra Patel held discussions on various issues. Before meeting Rupani, Bhupendra Patel drove to the house of Nitin Patel. Talking to reporters after the meeting with Bhupendra Patel, Nitin Patel said the new CM and he are friends and share family relations. “Whether I get any position or not is not a big deal for me. What matters is people’s love and respect,” Nitin Patel said. “We are all brothers and sisters. Whoever has been selected as the next CM is one of our own, and we will continue to work together.” He added that he continues to remain a BJP worker. A visibly emotional Nitin Patel, with a hint of tears in his eyes, said: “I congratulated Bhupendra Patel, who is an old family friend. He has asked for my guidance whenever needed.” On a philosophical note, Nitin Patel said: “The party, the leadership, God, and fate all work in their time.” He added: “I am happy that I have worked as a cabinet minister in the governments led by senior leaders such as Keshubhai Patel, Narendra Modi, and Anandiben Patel.” He went on to say: “I am a part of the party’s parliamentary board. I have received a lot from the party, and there is nothing I need to comment on.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/tearful-bonhomie-before-coronation/articleshow/86181889.cms||---

The students, who figured in the third merit list, will have to take admissions in the colleges where seats have been allotted by September 15 evening. After the declaration of three merit lists, the education department has confirmed seat allotment to 11,266 students in different streams. “Over 10,000 students are yet to be allotted seats, which we will do in the forthcoming special round of admissions, that will start shortly,” said officials. Nitin Upasani, the deputy director (Nashik region) of the state education department (Nashik region), told TOI that the department will ensure all students, who have applied get seats in junior colleges. This year 25,380 seats are available for FYJC admissions when the department started the admission process last month. Department officials said in the third merit list, the average cut off in the top science colleges was around 91.2%, 87.6 for commerce and 73.2% for arts. “The department could not accommodate over 7,752 students in the third merit list although they were eligible due to different factors like choice of college given by the student, cut off marks etc,” said officials. “The colleges have to surrender all the vacant quota seats to the department, which will further swell the availability of seats in the junior colleges in the city,” added the officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/over-2000-get-seats-in-3rd-round-of-fyjc-admissions/articleshow/86177073.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Trichy||City expansion, bus terminus plan raise land prices in Trichy||Trichy: The dormant real estate sector on the outskirts of Trichy city has got a shot in the arm with the state government proposing to expand Trichy corporation as well as set up the integrated bus terminus (IBT) and wholesale vegetable market on the suburbs. Land promoters say land value has increased up to 80% recently with some plot owners in areas like Panjappur and Olaiyur holding back their properties to sell at a lucrative price.Since long-pending infrastructure projects such as IBT were not making any progress, there has been a lull in sales in the suburbs with huge private land parcels. But in the past two months, as several hundred crores worth investment announcements were made for Panjappur and other areas, there has been a surge in demand. From being sold at Rs 500 per square feet, land value in Panjappur has touched Rs 900 per square feet now. In fact, the rate of the surge in suburbs has surpassed the increase in land value in core city where minimum price of land has increased from 1,800 per square feet to 2,500 per square feet. “Previously, only about 60% of enquiries converted into actual sales, but after the bus stand proposal, it is almost 100%. Expansion proposal of Trichy corporation has given a significant leap for the real estate sector,” K Dharman, land promoter in Trichy said. The under-construction semi-ring road project linking several suburbs on five national highways has further encouraged owners to sell their remote area properties too.“Native IT professionals working elsewhere have been the most interested. Easier bank loans are encouraging them to invest huge sums on land in developing areas,” J Lenin, district president, Tamilnadu real estate owners and mediators’ welfare association, told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/city-expansion-bus-terminus-plan-raise-land-prices-in-trichy/articleshow/86184211.cms||Deepak Karthik

In Madurai, around 6,500 samples are being tested for Covid-19 per day on average for the past week while on few days it has even gone up to 7,000-8,000.“Only when we keep the number of testing samples consistent over a period of time, we can properly assess positivity rate. We do not plan on bringing down testing. We are mainly testing all primary and secondary contacts of Covid-19 positive cases and all fever and Influenza-like Illness (ILI) cases from hospitals and primary health centres (PHCs) as per protocol,” said Dr S Senthil Kumar, deputy director of health services, Madurai. He added that a small number of people are also voluntarily coming forward for Covid-19 testing.The positivity rate has been consistently hovering around 0.2% in the district, which is the lowest in the state. Despite reopening of schools and colleges, the number of fresh cases per day in the district has not seen a major rise so far. Health officials also assured that there have been no Covid-19 cases among students or staff of any educational institution. “Keeping testing high will help us detect any rise in cases early. Though the low positivity rate is encouraging, public must not let their guard down. With more awareness about it now, public must act responsibly,” said a health official. With vaccination also progressing at a brisk rate in the district, health officials are hoping to bring down active cases further.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-district-continues-to-test-6-5k-swabs-per-day/articleshow/86181923.cms||---

Now, the health department has asked the gram panchayats to provide funds for the kits. The lack of RAT kits is also affecting the testing in rural areas of the tribal-dominated Peth taluka as the people are not willing to visit the primary health centres (PHC) for giving swab samples for the RT-PCR tests. “We need around 13,500 RAT kits for the taluka — considering 10 per cent of total population of 1.35 lakh. We now have about 300 kits only. While we ask the suspected patients to undergo RT-PCR tests, the ones who are asymptomatic refuse to take it. Hence, the number of tests being conducted are falling,” Yogesh More, taluka health officer (Peth), said. “The RAT kits enable us to conduct tests at market places and even at bus stands.

BJP and NCP made it clear that since the seats were reserved for OBCs, they will field members from the same community, reports Prafulla Marpakwar. BJP spokesman Chandrashekhar Bawankule blamed the MVA government for the “fiasco” over OBC reservation in local self-governing bodies. “The MVA government has ditched the members of the OBC community. It was well within the powers of the state government to postpone the polls till the period the row was resolved,” he said. Congress spokesman Atul Londhe blamed BJP for its failure to provide reservation for the OBCs. “When the 127th amendment was passed, it was the responsibility of BJP to ensure that the existing ceiling of 50% reservation was removed. NDA, particularly BJP, has done great injustice to the Maratha and OBC communities,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/congress-and-bjp-trade-charges/articleshow/86186395.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

These institutions said that a variety of factors affected rankings this time, including more number of participants and struggle to improve scores on some parameters.While Alagappa University improved its rank both under overall and universities categories compared to last year, Madurai Kamaraj University and Manonmaniam Sundaranar University saw a drop in rankings. NIRF evaluates institutions on various parameters like teaching, learning and resources, research and professional practice, graduation outcome, outreach and inclusivity. It also evaluates research papers as also perception of public, academics and employers. Compared to 2020, there were more institutions this year.“Our score has mainly improved in publications and research, and student diversity compared to last year. We are providing fellowships for other states and are providing support for women and differently-abled students, fellowships and tuition fee waiver for students from economically poor backgrounds,” said J Jeyakanthan, director of Alagappa University ranking cell.Madurai Kamaraj University dropped from 60th to 63rd in university rankings while in the overall category, it improved from 84th to 83rd rank. University officials said there is no significant drop in the overall score but that competition was more this time, especially with more private institutions also participating.In arts and sciences colleges category, Thiagarajar College of Arts and Sciences, Madurai, dropped one place to rank 23rd. College principal D Pandiaraja said that last time only 1,659 colleges participated in the rankings while this year, the number had risen to 1,802. “We have been improving our ranking over the years from securing 44th rank in 2018. This time too, the score has been high overall except under the perception and regional diversity parameters,” he added. The regional diversity parameter has in particular been challenging for south Tamil Nadu institutions to score well in as it requires other state students coming in to study.Meanwhile, some arts and sciences colleges in south TN, including Virudhunagar Hindu Nadars Senthikumara Nadar College and VOC College have improved their rankings whereas colleges including Lady Doak College and St Xavier’s College, Palayamkottai etc., dropped a few places.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/many-south-tn-institutions-struggle-to-improve-nirf-rank/articleshow/86181941.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan

A meeting will be held soon to finalise this. AIIMS had revised its guidelines pertaining to PPEs for health care workers during the pandemic. To ensure safety of HCWs, the institute decided to allow gown based PPEs in non-Covid areas, emergency and screening areas. There was also the option of having either gown or coverall based PPEs in the Covid ICU and laboratories. “We have already circulated a modified guideline among our committee members who are deliberating on the guidelines. A feedback from the HCWs has been taken. We shall soon take a final call regarding the same,” said Prof Arunaloke Chakrabarthi, head of the microbiology department, PGI. The gown-based PPE kit includes a gown with N95 masks, goggles with face shield, gloves and long shoe cover. AIIMS also recommended a well fitting N95 or equivalent mask meeting requisite standards in clinical areas. “It is not easy to wear coveralls and perform routine activities in the hospital. Initially, there was a lot of demand and consequent shortage of the coverall when the pandemic had just started. But with generation of evidence, it has been clear that there is no requirement of such protection in non-Covid or less infection zones,” said a faculty in PGI. PGI gets its stock of PPEs from GoI and there is a team that checks the quality of protected gear donated for HCWs. “The safety of HCWs has to be kept in mind. Guidelines will be approved once they agree with team members,” said a faculty in PGI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pgi-plans-to-restrict-ppes-to-covid-icus-labs/articleshow/86179763.cms||Shimona Kanwar

With an investment of Rs 11,000 crore, 22000 people would get employment. Chouhan said despite the corona crisis, there was an increase of 38% in employment creation, 48% in the number of industrial units and 32% in land allocation.

---||Delhi||Delhi: No Covid bail for inmates involved in dacoity, robbery or abduction||NEW DELHI: The high-power committee (HPC) set up last year to decongest the capital’s jails during the pandemic has clarified that offences like dacoity, robbery and kidnapping for ransom are not covered under its criteria for granting interim bail to prisoners. Headed by Delhi high court’s Justice Vipin Sanghi, the committee issued the clarification after confusion arose in some cases where different orders were passed by various courts on inmates who had committed offences like murder and robbery. To avoid conflicting orders, the committee was asked by the high court to clarify on interim bail for the accused facing trial under sections 364A (kidnapping for ransom), 394 (voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery) and 397 (robbery, dacoity with an attempt to cause death or grievous hurt) of IPC. The committee added that the panel had complete discretion to decide which class of prisoners could be released and one of the relevant factors was “nature of offence”. Referring to the April 13, 2020 order of the Supreme Court, the committee underlined that “no prisoner, irrespective of the category/class of offence that he/she may be involved in, can seek or claim that he/she be released from prison, as a matter of right”. It pointed out that offences having a punishment for 10 years up to life imprisonment were consciously not included in the first place in the class or category of those eligible to be released on interim bail and “there was no question of putting these offences in the ‘exclusion clause’.” The clause includes those categories of crimes where an inmate is eligible for interim bail. “The object was only to release some of the prisoners, and not all the prisoners, on a reasonable classification,” the committee added, explaining that the inmates who were facing trial for an offence that prescribes punishment of 10 years up to life imprisonment but were not involved in multiple cases were included, but only if the prisoners were suffering from HIV, cancer, chronic kidney dysfunction (UTPs requiring dialysis), hepatitis B or C, asthma and TB. “Merely because specified offence — like offence under Section 302 (murder) of IPC, that too with a rider, was included in the class/category of cases recommended for grant of interim bail, it does not mean that offences like dacoity, robbery, kidnapping for ransom, etc were also included. Such cases were consciously kept out,” the committee said in the minutes of the meeting on September 8, which also included Delhi Police commissioner Rakesh Asthana. The committee was constituted last year on the direction of the Supreme Court to decongest jails and take steps to prevent spread of Covid-19. In its latest meeting, the panel reiterated that those inmates whose cases were not covered in the criteria laid down by it could still file an application seeking bail before the court concerned, which, if filed, might be considered by the courts on merits.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/no-covid-bail-for-inmates-involved-in-dacoity-robbery-or-abduction/articleshow/86181987.cms||---

The compensation was disbursed after six months but they claimed that farmers in 59 revenue villages were left out.In this regard, the Madurai bench of Madras high court has issued notice to the Union and state governments on a PIL filed by a farmers association. Petitioner Swamimalai S Vimalnathan, secretary of Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers Protection Association, said that Nivar and Burevi cyclones had caused widespread kurivai crop damage in delta districts. The insurance companies disbursed the compensation after a delay of six months, but among the insured farmers, those in 59 villages in Thanjavur are yet to be disbursed the same.Due to unseasonal rain during January, thaladi and samba paddy crops on thousands of acres got damaged. Insurance companies are yet to provide compensation for that loss too, he said. Praying to disburse the compensation with interest to all affected farmers, the association filed an affidavit before the court. Prime Minister's crop insurance scheme is meant to compensate losses suffered by farmers due to the reduction in crop yield as estimated by the appropriate government authorities along with the concerned insurance companies. The scheme also covers pre-sowing losses, post-harvest losses due to cyclone rain and losses due to unseasonal rainfall.Vimalnathan alleged that though farmers pay insurance premium every season, they were unable to get the compensation for crop loss on time as the insurance companies were delaying disbursal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/yet-to-get-crop-insurance-say-farmers-in-59-villages/articleshow/86184235.cms||---

Two public meetings are being organised by BJP and Congress respectively. Union home minister Amit Shah would address the saffron party’s public meeting in Nirmal district, while Leader of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge would speak at Congress’ valedictory of Dalita Girijana Atma Gaurava Dandora public meeting at Gajwel, the assembly constituency represented by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao. Even the Left parties, including CPI and CPM and other organisations, have planned flag hoisting and other programmes coinciding with September 17. CPI would pay tributes to the martyrs of the Telangana Armed Struggle. The Nizam-ruled erstwhile Hyderabad State was merged into the Indian Union on September 17, 1948. BJP has been demanding that the government celebrate the Liberation Day officially, and that it would do so if voted to power in 2023. Congress, which had launched a series of Dandora public meetings on August 9 coinciding with the anniversary of the Quit India Movement, is holding its last meeting in Gajwel on Friday. “Congress will release a chargesheet, the list of unfulfilled promises made by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao and TRS leaders to the SCs and STs in the last seven years, from the dais of Dandora public meeting in Gajwel,” a senior party leader said.

The association stated that the increase would help rural students who aspire to study in government-affiliated agriculture colleges and private agriculture colleges.Agriculture science is taught as a vocational course at various government and government-aided higher secondary schools and some private schools across the state. Tamil Nadu teachers’ recruitment board appoints teachers who get a diploma from agriculture or horticulture science institutes. Agriculture or horticulture science (vocational) students have only the option to study BSc agriculture as higher studies in agriculture universities. However, the total seats reserved every year for these students is only 5%, which comes to 47 seats in the entire state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/demand-to-hike-college-seats-for-agri-vocational-students/articleshow/86184258.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Deal strongly with false propaganda: UP CM Yogi Adityanath to BJP spokespersons||LUCKNOW: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday said it was the responsibility of the party spokespersons to forward the information about the policies and schemes of the government and the party to the people. He was speaking at the state media workshop organized by UP BJP at the party headquarters. Asking the spokespersons to expose the wrongs and lies of the opposition, CM said the social media can be a strong medium to reach out to the people. The media workers also need to understand the difference between the national, state and regional media and there has to be coordination between them at state, regional and district level, the CM said. “We need to make people aware about the PM Awas scheme by coordinating with the gram pradhan. If the gram pradhan is the supporter of the opposition parties he would try to take credit for the work done under the scheme. We will have to work on this by telling people about the scheme,” he said, adding that it is the responsibility of the spokespersons that the benefit of the government schemes should reach the local level. The CM said that media workers of the party should convey their message effectively and repeatedly so that the opposition does not take the credit of the work done by the government. The false propaganda of the opposition needs to be dealt with strongly. “During the period of corona, opposition alleged that a fraud was committed in the purchase of PPE kit and infrared thermometer. When I compared the figures with Delhi, it came out that Delhi had spent three times of what UP had spent on the purchase. An FIR was lodged in Delhi and the opposition was exposed.” The state president of the party, Swatantra Dev Singh said that media workers of the party should develop a connection with as many people as possible through their behaviour and actions. “You will have to work according to a strategy,” he said. Deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya addressed the inaugural session of the workshop. “The movement that is going on under the name of the farmers is a chunav aandolan. Farmers are with the BJP and vice versa. The anti-farmer forces are behind this movement. We need to be wary of the rumour mongers,” he said. State general secretary (organization) Sunil Bansal said that the media wing of the party should ensure that the government schemes and campaigns should get a wide coverage. He also shared the details of the programmes that the party will hold between September 17 and October 7 on the occasion of the birthday of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. National media co-head of the party, Sanjay Mayukh said that there has been a change in the structure of the media and the number of the media has also increased. The media wing of the party will have to consider the nature of the media as well, like print media, digital media, and electronic media. The national spokesperson of the party Dr Sambit Patra said that they should counter the allegations made by the opposition using facts. The party will hold district level media workshops from September 20.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/deal-strongly-with-false-propaganda-cm-to-bjp-spokespersons/articleshow/86184279.cms||Neha Shukla
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat CM Bhupendra Patel likely to have a younger cabinet||AHMEDABAD: Hectic parleys continued through the afternoon in Gandhinagar on Monday as newly swornin chief minister Bhupendra Patel got down to the task of finalizing the names of candidates who will be in his council of ministers. Sources in the ruling party suggested that Bhupendra Patel (59) is likely to have a younger cabinet with the possibility that a few cabinet members over the age of 60 will be dropped to accommodate younger faces. The CM held a meeting with Amit Shah and other top leaders of the BJP, where the issue of who will be in the cabinet was discussed at length. Sources said that the names of Patel’s new cabinet are expected to be finalized in a day or two. Sources also informed that the swearing-in ceremony could take place either on Wednesday or a day later. Most leaders in the ruling party refused to comment anything about the new cabinet. However, on a philosophical note, Nitin Patel, while answering questions from the media on Monday, said, “The party, leadership, God and fate all work as per their time”. The party has given me positions in cabinet several times, made me the deputy chief minister, given me the important responsibilities of finance and Narmada (departments). I am happy that I have worked as a cabinet minister in the governments led by senior leaders like Keshubhai Patel, Narendra Modi, Anandiben Patel, and am a part of the party’s parliamentary board. I have received a lot from the party, and there is nothing I need to comment on.” Sources stated that one of the overriding criteria being discussed is that there should be a younger cabinet. This would imply that a few ministers above the age of 60 could possibly be dropped from the cabinet, sources said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/dada-likely-to-have-a-younger-cabinet/articleshow/86181967.cms||Kapil Dave

In contrast, areas under the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC), which has often been the source of several malaria and dengue outbreaks, have seen a sharp slide in both. Barely a dozen cases of dengue and malaria have so far been reported from Salt Lake and Rajarhat. A spurt in malaria cases in the past two months has compelled the KMC to engage more civic volunteers and honorary health workers for an aggressive anti-malaria drive. According to a KMC official, the civic body’s health department had already recorded 3,912 malaria cases across the city till the first week of September, which is a 15% increase compared to 2019. The figure also suggests that Kolkata’s malaria cases account for around 80% of the state’s share of the disease so far. According to civic sources, the malaria count was under control till June. “The situation suddenly turned worse in July when we recorded as many as 300 malaria cases from five boroughs. In August, too, several malaria cases were reported from some areas in central and north Kolkata,” said a KMC health department official. “Though the situation is not so bad, we are keeping a constant vigil after dengue cases were reported from several areas across the city,” said a KMC health department senior official. On the other hand, only eight dengue cases have been recorded in Bidhannagar so far. Around 200 had been affected by dengue last year but there was no casualty. The count was quite low compared to 2019 when over 2,000 were affected. Over 20 people have died of dengue in the BMC area from 2016 to 2019. “We have been spraying larvicide in all wards and urging residents not to allow water accumulation inside their houses. We have also conducted drone surveillance to keep a watch,” said BMC board of administrators chairperson Krishna Chakraborty. Even though figures are not available, doctors in Kolkata believe that the number of dengue and malaria cases had dipped sharply in the city last year, largely due to the Covid situation. “The lockdown and the distancing norms ensured that along with Covid, other transmissible diseases like malaria and dengue, too, were checked. Unfortunately, we have seen a letting down of guard post-second wave,” said RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences intensivist Sauren Panja.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/dengue-malaria-combo-starts-to-sting-amid-cov-third-wave-scare/articleshow/86179824.cms||Saikat Ray

PU campus opened to beaming students on Monday and once again, the campus was buzzing with activity. The university administration has made it clear that only one student will stay in one hostel room. Students have been allowed to have their food in the mess and there is no suggestion about opening the department canteen. All educational institutions in Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Chandigarh closed due to the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020. PU has been closed for the last one and a half years. However, more than 700 research scholars were staying in hostel. They had been instructed to carry their own food, but now that cases have ebbed, it has been decided to open the campus. The university will keep the following restrictions for the time being: There is a ban on food from outside for students staying in hostels, no visit to salon, washerman and tailor will be available to students living in the hostel and entry of guests/visitors will not be allowed till further orders. Other departments of the university will be opened in the after reviewing the situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pu-campus-comes-alive-after-1-5-years/articleshow/86179823.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Bypolls declared in view of SC order, dip in Covid cases, says SEC||MUMBAI: The state election commission on Monday declared bypolls to six zilla parishads and their panchayat samitis on October 5, without the OBC quota. The election dates were declared days after the apex court said it was the SEC’s prerogative to hold the election and the state’s Covid-related restrictions on elections did not apply to the bypolls. “In view of the SC order and the decline in the number of Covid cases, we decided to declare the bypoll dates,” said state election commissioner U P S Madan. The scrapping of political reservations for OBCs is a political hot potato, with the community battling for dominance against the Maratha community and its push for quotas. While Marathas are a traditional votebank of the Congress and NCP, the OBC vote is mainly with the BJP and Shiv Sena. The government fears a backlash from the OBC community and their move to the BJP. “We will consult all parties and find a way. In the future, even an ordinance could be considered,” said OBC affairs minister Vijay Wadettiwar. He also claimed that most parties would field OBC candidates from the open seats. The opposition blamed the government for the crisis. “If the state had taken steps to gather empirical data over the last six months, the OBC quota would have been restored,” said BJP leader Praveen Darekar. Just last week, an all-party meeting chaired by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had concluded that the state will ask for empirical data on OBCs and seek the deferral of local body polls if the data was delayed. The SC verdict, which reiterates that declaring polls is the SEC’s prerogative, has made this option difficult. In July, when the SEC tried to hold elections to five of the zilla parishads, the state had asked the SC to postpone the polls in view of the pandemic. The SC had asked the SEC to decide on the matter after consulting health and disaster management officials. The SEC had stayed the bypolls. On September 6, the SEC filed a compliance report in the SC, saying it had partially completed the election process and that it could be completed after the apex court gave directions and the state removed Covid-related restrictions on elections. OnSeptember 9, the SC ruled that declaring the polls was the SEC’s prerogative and the state’s Covid restrictions did not apply to the bypolls.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bypolls-declared-in-view-of-sc-order-dip-in-cases-in-mumbai-sec/articleshow/86182093.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar
---||Chandigarh||NIRF rankings: Chandigarh PGI again fails to score big in perception parameter||CHANDIGARH: Maintaining its second slot under NIRF ranking, PGI has again lost to AIIMS, mainly due to perception, outreach and inclusivity parameters. PGI’s senior doctors feel that the perception can be biased as it is not based on people’s views, unlike fixed norms of publications and patents. The point difference between the first and second rank under the medical institutes category has been 10 as in the previous NIRF ranking. For this year’s NIRF ranking, PGI scored five under the intellectual property right (IPR), which was previously two out of 10. For AIIMS, the score is eight from the previous rank of nine. As per the NIRF website, the perception parameter is gauged through a survey conducted on a large category of employers, professionals from reputed organisations and academics to ascertain their preference for graduates from different institutions. “AIIMS has always scored 100 on 100, while PGI scored 76 this time against the previous 71. This creates a difference of a lot of points to make it to the top slot,” said a senior faculty in PGI. Other parameters where PGI lost to AIIMS include research and professional practice, which comprises IPR, publications and quality of publications, among others. PGI scored 86 out of 100 while AIIMS got 97. In the previous rankings, the point difference between AIIMS and PGI has been 10 and the same parameters account for the lesser scores. These are outreach, inclusivity and perception. “Even Christian Medical College, Vellore at third slot scored 91 under perception category. Last time, it was 89. PGI needs to work on it. Some senior residents have been dropping out of the course here. If that is reduced, the perception can improve,” said a doctor from AIIMS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/nirf-rankings-pgi-loses-to-aiims-again/articleshow/86179801.cms||Shimona Kanwar

The programme titled ‘Pyar baante chalo’ was streamed live at various social media platforms. Mehdi, who also conducted the event, said, “Through such programmes, we are trying to crate awareness about the man, who gave such memorablesongs to Indian film industry. His works need to be appreciated, especially by the youngsters today because despite writing for films, he didn’t allow the standard of his poetry to fall. Bhopal didn’t give Asad his due, but as we celebrate his birth centenary year, we want the world to know about him and cherish his works.” Speaking on this occasion, well-known shayar, professor Atiqullah, said, Urdu Academy deserves accolades for organising the event as people of Bhopal had almost forgotten him. He contributed a lot to track the cultural history of Bhopal and put the city Indian map with his writings. Well-known film director and writer Rumi Jaffery, who also participated in the programme, said, “The list of shayars who promoted Urdu post independence, will never be complete without Asad Bhopali’s name in it along with Sahir, Kaifi Azmi etc. He was a shayar who gave a chance to many music directors and that says a lot about him.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bhopal-didnt-give-asad-bhopali-his-due-nusrat-mehdi/articleshow/86181994.cms||Vinita Chaturvedi
---||Thane||Dengue cases treble, malaria numbers also rising in Maharashtra||MUMBAI: Dengue cases have nearly tripled in the state this year compared to last year, a surge partly attributed to testing figures returning to normal levels. A rise has also been noted in malaria; two districts—Gadchiroli and Mumbai—are mainly contributing to the cases. The diversion of manpower to prevention of Covid and vaccination is also believed to be hampering vector control measures. The state has registered 5,944 cases and 11 dengue deaths so far this year, a jump from 2,029 cases and four fatalities seen till September last year. In terms of malaria, the state has reported 9,289 cases and two deaths. In the same period last year, there were 8,783 cases and five deaths. 95% of malaria cases coming from Mumbai, GadchiroliDr Pradeep Awate, state surveillance officer, said a rise in dengue cases is being reported from several districts. “It is concerning, and surveillance has been increased,” he said. Of the 11 dengue deaths, six have been reported from Nagpur district and one each from Wardha, Chandrapur, Bhandara, Ahmednagar and Thane. State entomologist Dr Mahendra Jagtap said favourable weather conditions, intermittent rainfall, humidity levels, all conducive for the spread of dengue, is contributing to the increase. “Testing too has increased for both dengue and malaria this year. Last year, there was a drop in testing for almost all ailments,” he said. The slide examinations for malaria, for instance, had dropped to 1.24crore last year compared to 1.72crore in 2019, a 28% decline. Dr Jagtap, however, admitted that vector control measures on the ground have taken a hit in many districts as trained staff have been sent to facilitate vaccination against Covid. Gadchiroli and Mumbai are reporting up to 95% of malaria cases. While Mumbai contributes to almost 40% of the state’s overall malaria incidence, the tribal-populated Gadchiroli district accounts for 56% cases. Dr Jagtap said the state’s remaining 3-4% malaria cases come from the rest of the state. The diversion of surveillance staff is affecting measures on the ground in two ways. Firstly, vector control activities, which include identifying and destroying breeding spots are not optimal. The second and more crucial part is monitoring of confirmed cases. Gadchiroli mainly sees falciparum malaria that requires treatment for three days, while Mumbai predominantly reports vivax malaria that has a 14-day treatment course. “We believe districts are not able to carry out the follow-ups to ensure that people have completed their treatment to reduce the parasitic load,” he said. Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer said there is no major rise in malaria or dengue in the city. “Malaria cases are seen only in endemic wards like Byculla, Parel, Worli, Prabhadevi. Some of them have dilapidated structures, sprawling railways tracks and workshops, which make vector control challenging,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/95-of-malaria-cases-coming-from-mumbai-gadchiroli/articleshow/86186606.cms||Sumitra Debroy

She said this in response to some media reports indicating that her father’s soft-spoken image worked against him. She said that a soft-spoken image where people can have easy access to a leader is the quality one would look for in a leader. “Wherever it was needed, my father has dealt sternly with people breaking the law,” she said. Her father stepped down as chief minister of Gujarat on Monday and passed on the baton to Bhupendra Patel, a first-time MLA from Ahmedabad. She also posted some old family pictures on the social media platform. In her post, she shared how her father was always kind and considerate towards others and tried to instil the same values in his children and other family members. She said her father was always the first to rush for help to others, be it the Kutch earthquake in 2001 or the Akshardham temple attack in 2002. “According to us, it is more courageous than anything else to give up power without causing any nuisance or resistance and following the principles of RSS and BJP,” she said in her post.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/giving-up-power-sans-nuisance-is-more-courageous-act/articleshow/86182045.cms||---

This — and continuous rainfall in the reservoirs’ catchments — prompted the state irrigation department to release water from all four dams on Monday. The rate of release, however, was moderate at 6,000 cusec. This was the first time this monsoon that the collective storage in the four reservoirs — Khadakwasla, Panshet, Varasgaon and Temghar — touched 100%, officials said. The stock in Bhama Askhed, which can store up to 7.43 thousand million cubic feet (TMC) of water, stood at 98%. The Pavana reservoir, which supplies Pimpri Chinchwad, was also full on Monday, as were nine reservoirs in the Bhima basin. Towards Monday afternoon, water discharged from Khadakwasla dropped to 3,000 cusec. It was again increased to over 5,000 cusec in the evening and 10,000 cusec at night. The irrigation department released water at 4,300 cusec from Pavana and 1,000 cusec from Mulshi (94% full). Popatrao Shelar, deputy engineer with the irrigation department, said the rate of water discharge will be increase if rainfall increases. “We maintained the rate of discharge at 6,000 cusec on Sunday and Monday,” he said. Till Monday evening, Temghar received over 45mm of rainfall, while Panshet and Varasgaon got 27mm each. Khadakwasla recorded 11mm of rainfall, Pavana received 34mm and Mulshi got 23mm. Local administrations have been alerted about a possible increase in water discharge and told to take adequate precautionary measures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/dams-catering-to-pune-full-discharge-of-water-begins/articleshow/86182014.cms||Sarang Dastane

He said adequate funds would be allocated for the scheme in the coming financial years too. The CM was speaking at a preparatory meeting at Pragati Bhavan on implementation of ‘Dalit Bandhu’ in the four mandals in four SC assembly constituencies apart from Huzurabad and Vasalamarri village. KCR told officials to identify beneficiaries in the four mandals and said funds would be released in a phased manner. The four more mandals where the scheme has been extended now are — Chintakani in Madhira; Charagonda in Achampet-Kalwakurthy; Nizamsagar in Jukkal; and Tirumalagiri in Thungaturthy. Since there has been a huge demand for dairy development units under the scheme, KCR directed chief secretary Somesh Kumar to hold a joint meeting with SC welfare and animal husbandry department. “I have personally announced Rs 1,000 crore for Dalit empowerment. The Dalit Bandhu scheme was formulated after discussions with all parties and also elders among the Dalits. Suggestions came that any mandal or assembly segment be picked to implement the scheme totally. Accordingly, it was was launched on a pilot basis in Huzurabad assembly constituency. This is not a routine scheme. It is a thought that no other state or central government ever had,” KCR said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cm-dalit-bandhu-meant-to-end-discrimination/articleshow/86184855.cms||Koride Mahesh

There is the plan to achieve 100% full immunization of senior citizens in these districts by holding near-home vaccination drives so that they feel encouraged to avail full immunization against Covid-19,” said Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director, health services. An estimated 16,09,563 population in the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR) is above 60 years of age. Of them, 10.3 lakh have received the first dose. Among them (10.3 lakh), 6.9 lakh senior citizens have received both the doses and have, thereby, achieved full immunization against Covid-19. “The near-home special vaccination drive will be primarily aimed at finishing the second dose vaccination among the senior citizens, who have received the first dose and are due for the second dose,” Deshmukh said. There are close to 1.6 crore senior citizens in Maharashtra who are 60 years and above. “About 65% of them have received the first dose,” Deshmukh said. The near-home vaccination initiative would be an attempt to encourage residents above 60 years of age — due for the second dose — to take it. Public health expert Subhash Salunke, former technical advisor to the state government on Covid-19, said, “Prioritising full immunization of senior citizens will result in significantly reducing severe illness, hospitalisation and deaths in senior citizens. This age group is particularly very vulnerable to Covid-19.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/near-home-drive-to-finish-full-inoculation-of-sr-citizens/articleshow/86182031.cms||Umesh Isalkar

A native of Bela area of Auraiya district, Priyanka on being trolled on social media, had resigned from the job after getting hurt by the comments of the people. After the acceptance of the resignation from the government, Priyanka is now regretting her decision of resignation. Priyanka after getting selected in the state police in the year 2020, got her first posting as a constable at MM Gate police station in Agra district. Recently, she allegedly made a video of her in police uniform with a revolver and uploaded it on Instagram account. Constable Priyanka Misra had probably shot the video inside a police station. Clip showed her lip-syncing to a dialogue. The speaker seeks to compare UP’s notoriety with that of Punjab and Haryana, before suggesting that children as young as five years old have access to guns in the state. “Haryana, Punjab toh bekaar hi badnaam hai. Aao kabhi Uttar Pradesh. Rangbaazi kya hoti hai hum tumhe batate hain… naa gunday pe gaana banaate hain, naa gaadi pe Jat-Gujjar likhaate hain. Humare yahaan 5-5 saal ke launde katta chalaate hain (Haryana and Punjab unnecessarily have a bad name… Come to UP. Neither do we glorify crime with songs, nor do we display our caste on our cars. In UP, kids as young as five know how to use guns),” she had lip synced on this dialogue. Her video became rage and she was trolled on the social media. Muniraj G, the, then SSP of Agra took serious note of the viral video and shunted Priyanka to line.After, which she went to line and appeared there and later resigned. The CO had investigated the matter on the instructions of the SSP. After this, on September 12, she was apprised that her resignation was accepted. She also told reporters that she has been asked to pay 1.5 lakh rupees for training. “Right now, I am in utter pain.

According to police, the accused, who runs a hypnotism clinic, was produced before a city court on Monday and has been remanded in one-day police custody. “The complainant had gone to the clinic on September 8 for a session as she was feeling irritated. While at the clinic, the woman claimed that the hypnotist touched her indecently on the pretext of checking her,” a police officer said. “The woman after coming home brought the matter to the notice of her family members after which they lodged a police compliant on Sunday. Soon after the complaint was lodged, we got into action and arrested the accused,” he added. Panchavati police said the case is being investigated further.

The water supply department of the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation said it would get an additional 100 MLD of water from Andra dam, as well as 200 MLD from Bhama Askhed next year onwards. “We will restore daily water supply in phases across the twin towns from November. The jackwell work for this purpose is underway,” municipal commissioner Rajesh Patil told TOI. “The Pavana dam — from where we lift water for daily supply — is full, but our current system needs to be strengthened to be able to provide water daily at adequate pressure,” PCMC joint city engineer Praveen Ladkat said. Around 25 lakh people live in PCMC limits and need about 490 MLD of water per day. The extra 300 MLD will help maintain adequate pressure for daily supply, officials said. Ladkat said PCMC has implemented 24x7 water supply on a pilot basis in Nigdi Pradhikaran in May. “We are studying the supply and usage pattern. We plan to extend this round-the-clock supply to other zones eventually,” he said. Harshad Jadhav, a resident of Pimple Gurav, said residents were inconvenienced by alternative day supply and that PCMC should have done this much earlier. “The water pressure too is low. PCMC should work towards fixing it,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pcmc-plans-to-restore-daily-supply-from-november/articleshow/86182037.cms||---

These advanced radio diagnostic and laboratory diagnostic centers are being opened in various hospitals in private-public partnership (PPP) mode. The state-wide launch was done by Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh virtually. The health minister said that the Punjab government has initiated this project at a total cost of around Rs 80 crore to provide world class diagnostic services round the clock at affordable prices. He said private hospitals were charging exorbitantly for the same tests. The health minister added that all the existing government laboratories of the health department had been equipped with modern machines procured at a cost of Rs 4 crore. Also, 100 lab technicians had been recruited to streamline operations. On efforts made by the state government to deal with the Covid pandemic, Sidhu said the state government has so far conducted 1.25 crore tests and more than one crore people have been vaccinated, 76 PSA plants have been set up and more than 8,000 oxygen concentrators have been given to various hospitals. He pointed out that patients of deprived sections were treated free of cost and 44,000 Fateh kits were distributed. Despite the pandemic, the health department provided employment to more than 11,000 people, including doctors, paramedics and ministerial staff, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/get-radiology-lab-diagnostic-services-at-70-lower-rates/articleshow/86179828.cms||---
---||Kolkata||TMC, BJP take Bhowanipore bypoll battle to virtual space||KOLKATA: Cornered by EC-announced Covid protocol and learning a lesson from the assembly election campaign five months ago, both Trinamool Congress and BJP are stressing on social media and e-campaign over road shows and rallies in the Bhowanipore bypolls scheduled on September 30. #MamataForBhabanipur and #BJP4Bhabanipur have been the top draws on Twitter and Facebook for the last few days and are also picking up top trends on Google as both Trinamool and BJP are exploring the internet and social media space to campaign for the upcoming byelection alongside door-to-door campaigns and street corners in absence of any large road shows and rallies. While leaders like Firhad Hakim, Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay and Madan Mitra, who have millions of followers and have very active social media pages, have been tasked to lead the online campaign along with the offline street corners and door-to-door visits, leaders like Kartik Banerjee and Subrata Mukherjee, who do not have similar reach on their profiles and pages, have also been asked to increase the number of posts — photographs and videos of street-corner meetings. Sources said, all Twitter and Facebook pages of the leaders who are running the campaign on Mamata Banerjee’e behalf are now being professionally managed. “During this pandemic, the virtual space is the best place to campaign.  It involves minimum risk of contracting the infection and also helps out send out message to the masses even in a localised area,” said a senior Trinamool leader who has been working closely with I-Pac, the Parashant Kishore-run company that is handling the election campaign in Bhowanipore and has been instrumental in promoting #MamataForBhabanipur. BJP, too, is not lagging behind with the IT cell coming up with innovative posts and keeping the conversations on the web platform engaging with hourly updates about candidate Priyanka Tibrewal’s campaign in the constituency. While the chief minister has already tasked her commanders — senior party leaders and colleagues — handing them in charge of multiple wards under her constituency as she is juggling between managing the state and handling short campaigns, her primary contender Tibrewal is handling the campaign mostly by herself. Although she has senior leaders like Dilip Ghosh and Suvendu Adhikari campaigning for her, she is looking after the offline as well as online campaign mostly by herself. “The pandemic has restricted the way we generally used to campaign before an election. But we are adapted to the changed scenario and have been stressing on online campaigns for Bhowanipore,” said a BJP leader.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tmc-bjp-take-bypoll-battle-to-virtual-space/articleshow/86179845.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

Mentored by ace mountaineer and UP cadre IPS officer Aparna Kumar, the ITBP expedition codenamed ‘Prakaram’ was launched on August 7, 2021 from the 1st Battalion based at Joshimath and returned to the base on September 7 after successfully hoisting the tricolor at Mount Balbala peak on September 4. Aparna KumarKumar, now DIG ITBP, Dehradun sector, was the key person in organizing this expedition after taking approval from the headquarters. She guided and motivated the team from Dehradun and the success came after two failed attempts. The expedition was led by assistant commandant Bhim Singh, and included sub inspectors Praveen, Ashish Ranjan, Nikhil and constables Sunil Kumar, Pradeep Panwar while the navigator was Raju Martolia. “The terrain of Mount Balbala is quite tough and is known for very inclement weather, which makes the expedition very challenging,” she told TOI. “The ITBP personnel from our sector took the task as a challenge and did not return despite failing two times. They kept their spirits and enthusiasm high and waited for the weather to improve and even planned a new trekking route and finally accomplished their goal,” said Kumar. The expedition was not about just trekking, but the ITBP personnel also checked the levels of glaciers, flora, fauna and other geographical and strategic aspects of the peak and terrain, she added. “We will continue to trek and explore the peaks which are still untouched,” said Kumar. The mountain-trained force, ITBP, is accredited to have successfully scaled more than 220 peaks since its formation in 1962. Aparna is a 2002 batch IPS officer and bestowed with Tenzing Norgay National adventure award in 2019. “We will continue to trek and explore the peaks which are still untouched,” said Kumar.

Now known as Hotel Chidambara on Central Bazar Road in Ramdaspeth, it was also among the prime properties to be auctioned by a bank those days when loan defaults had become a major issue. The hotel was taken over by Shikshak Sahakari Bank, which auctioned it under the Maharashtra State Cooperatives Act to recover its dues. The current structure is being broken down to pave way for another hotel, a 3-star one. The property spread in an area of over 9,600 square feet has been purchased by Orient Group, which runs a chain of nine budget hotels in the city. The property was purchased for Rs12 crore from one Agrawal family, whose members held it after the death of the patriarch Balakrishna Agrawal who had originally bought the hotel from Shikshak Sahakari Bank. Afzal Mitha of the Orient Group, who confirmed the development, said there are plans to build a new hotel in three years. “The property was purchased last year and now as the situation is improving on Covid front, we have started with the demolition work,” he said. The Orient Group plans to build eight-storeyed structure with 60 rooms in the new hotel, apart from facility like banquet hall, he said. The Hotel Royal Palace originally belonged to Raj Kumar Khattar, a businessman from the city. As it went into losses, Shikshak Sahakari Bank took over the property. Khattar’s bungalow behind Alankar theatre was also taken over by the bank. The auction by the bank had gained much attention in 2003. After over three rounds, it finally fetched over Rs4.52 crore, said a source in the bank. Agrawal had then changed the name from Hotel Royal Palace to Hotel Chidambara. The hotel ran for some years and ultimately closed down around decade ago. Even under the new management, the hotel came under hammer. This time, the action was under Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act (SARFESI Act) by a PSU bank. Mitha said this would be the first ever premium hotel of the Orient Group. “So far, we have been only into budget hotels where the business depends on volumes,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/royal-palace-to-chidambara-hotel-paves-way-for-new-3-star/articleshow/86182167.cms||Shishir Arya

All the zonal and taluka-level officers have been told to address the pendency of vaccination on Co-WIN portal, following poor response to the drive offering second dose. According to the circular issued on September 11, the employees hired on contract should be checked if they have got both the doses, besides the regular staffers. It has clearly mandated vaccination for the healthcare and frontline workers and submitting the certificates. The deputy divisional officer has been appointed the nodal officer to keep a tab on it, while the district immunization officer has been told to coordinate the same. Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer, Pune Zilla Parishad, said, “The basic idea behind checking the vaccination certificate is to clear the pendency among the beneficiaries associated with healthcare or frontline jobs. As crowding has increased, it is necessary to stop these officials from becoming super-spreaders and keep them and their family members safe.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/district-collector-seeks-vax-certificates-of-govt-employees/articleshow/86182066.cms||Piyush Bhusari

Dr Bapusaheb Nagargoje, the NMC’s medical superintendent told TOI, “The city will have availability of around 400 metric tonne of medical oxygen at any given point during the third wave. This quantum is around 160 MT higher than what the state government had directed the civic body to plan for the possible third wave.” According to him, the major part of the availability (over 267 MT) will come from the tanks to store liquid medical oxygen (LMO,) that the civic body, Nashik Civil Hospitals and few private hospitals have set up. NMC will have the bulk of the gas storage among all these stakeholders. “Also, the NMC is in the process of setting up 20 pressure swing adsorption (PSA) plants with a capacity of producing around 48 MT a day. We also have about 2,200 jumbo cylinders and 19 Dura cylinders,” he said. The state health department has directed NMC to make medical oxygen provisions for the third wave thrice higher than 80 MT a day, which was the requirement during the peak period of the second wave in the city. “We have planned much higher availability of the medical oxygen since there is a need to have buffer stock even if the daily requirement goes up during the third wave as compared to the second one,” he added. While planning the oxygen availability, NMC has kept in mind that the supply of the gas for refilling the LMO tanks could face hiccups due to erratic supply as there could be demand from other districts too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/sufficient-o-available-for-3rd-wave-nmc/articleshow/86177230.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

Nineteen-year-old Nandini Agarwal from Morena in Madhya Pradesh topped the CA finals on Monday, while her elder brother, Sachin, 21, bagged 18th all-India rank. She scored 614 out of 800 (76.75%) marks in the CA Final to beat 83,000 candidates for the top slot. Her brother secured 568. “Our company is unique,” laughed the siblings as they celebrated their victory. “Proud of you both! Best wishes for the future endeavors,” tweeted CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan. The siblings have a habit of being toppers. Together. Alumni of Victor Convent School, they topped Morena district jointly in their Class 12 in 2017, bagging 94.5%. How is it that they ended up giving the boards together while being two years apart? Nandini said, “I had skipped two classes early in childhood and since class 2, we have been classmates.” There was sibling support rather than rivalry, they said. “In fact, my brother played a very important role in my success,” Nandini told TOI. “In my mock test, I used to get poor marks. That was very demotivating. I’d feel frustrated and wonder how I would fare in the real test if I did so poorly in the mock exams. My brother’s support worked like magic. He always encouraged me to keep practicing and not think about the mock test results,” said Nandini. Sachin said that Nandini had always worked hard in school and later. “She inspired me. Seeing her, I also started focusing on my studies. I must give credit to her for encouraging me.” “We are a force together,” they laughed. “I and Bhaiyya would put our heads together to tackle the tough problems. We helped each other,” said Nandini. “Cracking CA was my mother’s dream. I am happy that we did it in style,” said Sachin. Their father, Naresh Chandra Gupta, is a tax practitioner, while mother Dimple Gupta is a homemaker.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/star-siblings-morena-girl-tops-ca-bro-comes-18th/articleshow/86182086.cms||Ramendra Singh

The duo bought liquor to celebrate after the murder, and, when arrested, claimed they were upset due to their cousin’s death to explain their intoxication. Cops have also discovered the two had debts amounting to Rs 3 lakh. Sanjay has claimed he was upset after Susmita revealed Sanjay’s request for a loan and was after her gold jewellery. “Sandip said he was burdened by having to help run the house and hoped the crime would relieve him,” said joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma. The accused, cops said, had spent around 72 hours planning and executing the crime. They had checked out the area three days earlier to figure out how to avoid being caught on CCTV and spent time at the house after the murders to remove technical evidence. “They carried clothes with them to change into after the crime, logged the child out of his online class to prevent getting a call from the school, washed cups and even taken showers in the house. The duo later returned after the victim’s husband broke the news of her death and consoled him,” a source said. The brothers’ arrest has left their mother shattered. Gita Das, who shared a “special bond” with Sushmita, said the incident has taken away the “reason for her existence”. “I knew my sons to be timid. I have no idea what they did and why. If I knew, I would have warned them,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/behala-murders-gold-sold-for-rs-30k/articleshow/86179897.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu assembly passes bill to nullify NEET, BJP walks out||CHENNAI: In a near-unanimous motion, the Tamil Nadu assembly on Monday passed a bill for admission to medical courses only on the basis of Class XII marks in board examinations. The bill also provides for 7.5% horizontal reservation in medical courses for students of government schools. “Admissions to medical education courses are traceable to Entry 25 of List III, Schedule VII of the Constitution. Therefore, the state government is competent to regulate the same. So, I am moving this bill,” chief minister M K Stalin said, evoking loud thumping of desks in the treasury. The bill seeks to circumvent NEET and, instead, have only Class XII marks as criterion for admissions to MBBS, BDS, Indian medicine and homeopathy courses. While opposition parties like the AIADMK and the PMK, besides DMK allies, supported the bill, the BJP members walked out of the assembly in protest. A high-level committee, headed by Justice A K Rajan, former judge of the Madras high court, set up by the DMK government in June, reported to the government that NEET had undermined the diverse societal representation in MBBS and higher medical courses, favouring the affluent groups, while thwarting the dream of pursuing medical education by the underprivileged sections.The most-affected were the students of government schools, those having parental income of less than Rs 2.5 lakh per annum and that of Most Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The committee said the NEET neither seemed to ensure merit nor standard of the students being offered MBBS under its purview. The Justice Rajan committee received views from 86,342 people both offline and online and submitted its report on July 14. “The committee has recommended that the state government pass an act, like Tamil Nadu Admission in Professional Educational Institutions Act, 2006 (Tamil Nadu Act 3 of 2007),” Stalin said. Following the recommendations, the state government set up another committee of secretaries led by chief secretary V Irai Anbu on July 15. The committee of secretaries recommended the same route to nullify NEET. The chief minister said it was wrong to say that NEET improved the standard of medical examination. Tamil Nadu had one of the highest number of medical and dental institutions even before 2017. The standard of medical and dental professionals from these institutions was high. “Admission done based on the qualifying examination will no way lower the standard of education, since the higher secondary syllabus is of sufficient standard,” Stalin said. If the marks are adjusted through a normalisation method, it would provide a just, fair and equitable method of admission, he said. The government decided to enact a law to ensure social justice, uphold equality and equal opportunity, protect all vulnerable student communities, and ensure a robust public health care in the state, especially in the rural areas, Stalin said. He recalled the legal battle by the DMK government and all political parties resulted in the historic achievement of obtaining 27% reservation for OBC under All India Quota for medical courses. “I urge the legislators of all political parties to extend full cooperation in the NEET issue and support to create history in social justice,” the chief minister said. In the afternoon, when the Bill was taken up for consideration and passage, BJP floor leader Nainar Nagendran said his party opposed the Bill. He said 57,219 out of 99,610 students, who wrote NEET, cleared the test last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tn-assembly-passes-bill-to-nullify-neet-bjp-walks-out/articleshow/86182116.cms||---

He spoke to Neha Lalchandani about the significance of Ayodhya in UP politics and how his party hopes to make a dent in the 2022 assembly elections.Manish Sisodia and Sanjay Singh at Saryu river in Ayodhya on MondayQ. What is the significance of holding the Tiranga Yatra in Ayodhya?We are holding Tiranga Yatras across the state. This is the third one for me. Ayodhya is important because of the Ram Temple and Hanuman Garhi. It has its own significance in Indian history. By praying to Lord Ram and carrying the tricolour, it will make our work even more sacred. Q. AAP is often accused of dabbling in soft Hindutva. How should one see your visit to Ayodhya at this point when other political parties are also making a beeline for the temple town?Ram belongs to everyone. Everyone should come to Ayodhya. Ram Rajya is synonymous with good governance. If someone is coming to Ayodhya to do politics on Ram, then it is a different matter but Ram Rajya is the best form of governance. Ram is a God but we need to take inspiration from him. We should ask those people who politicise Ram why a journalist who revealed that salt and roti was being served in mid-day meals was in jail, why did the Hathras rape take place. Ram is only a symbol for them, not an inspiration. Q. Without any political alliance, what do you think of AAP’s chances in the 2022 polls?Every party has been new at some point. We have formed a government in Delhi thrice but at some point, we were also new to the city. People have now seen all political parties and are going in for a new kind of politics. In Delhi, we do not have as many resources or power that the government in UP has but still we have been able to supply cheaper power, better schools, drinking water etc. People are now looking for good governance. Q. UP politics is centred significantly around caste and community equations. Do you think AAP is equipped to take on stronger regional parties in such a scenario?Caste becomes important when there is no governance. People think that when every political party is the same, when they have the same kinds of policies, the same level of corruption, then they look for alternatives like caste and community. If there is an alternative, like AAP, which has been tested in Delhi, then they realise that they can access better health and education facilities, power, water and better infrastructure, and then caste and community do not have a role to play.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/ram-rajya-is-best-form-of-govt-says-manish-sisodia/articleshow/86184362.cms||Neha Lalchandani

A study published recently said that most of the patients visiting PGI are elderly and proposed implementation of separate protocols to manage elderly patients in the emergency department to prevent falls and other such incidents. The study conceded that the engineering aspects of the emergency OPD has been well taken care of but there was the scope of ensuring non-slippery surfaces, the study said. The study has been published in the “Journal of postgraduate medicine, education and research” from the departments of National Institute of Nursing Education, Community Medicine and the department of internal medicine. Researchers decided to conduct the study as they felt that the older patients in the emergency department are a vulnerable population at high risk of functional decline. “Though elderly patients were being managed adequately in the emergency medicine OPD, there was a definite scope of initiating a system of formal SOPs/protocols for various domains,” said Dr Sukhpal Kaur, a co-author of the study. The sample size of the study comprised 400 patients in the emergency area. Around one-third (31.5%) of patients presented in emergency with complaints of severe pain (abdominal, chest, headache and backache) followed by episodes of dizziness (14.75%), breathing difficulty (14.5%) and accidental falls (9.5%). More than half the patients (63%) were suffering from circulatory diseases, with hypertension being the most common complaint. It was found that appropriate door handles were there in the study setting. “Availability of low height beds and trolleys, bedsides commode, raised toilet were also required. There was a need to enhance access to natural light/proper light in halls and washrooms of the study setting,” mentioned the study. Researchers suggested that there was a strong need for provision of pressure ulcer-reducing mattresses even on trollies on which patients had to lie down till allotment of beds. “There should be an adequate number of blankets and bedsheets for elderly patients because they can easily develop an acute febrile illness due to disturbed homeostasis and decreased immunity. Provision of hand railings for support in corridors will help patients walk properly. The use of proper signage will also help patients and their attendants get oriented to the environment in such a busy and overcrowded department and help them reach wherever they want. The provision of a large face analog clock will be an added facility to orient the patients with time,” mentioned the study. Facilitating the elderly:The study proposed to introduce the practice of using various assessment scales to assess risk of falls, cognitive decline, functional decline, urine incontinence, nutritional status and frailty for elderly patients. The need to implement separate protocols to manage elderly patients in the emergency department to prevent falls, standardised urinary catheterisation and a policy to promote mobility with the assistance of staff or attendants was stressed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/study-suggests-non-slip-surface-other-amenities-for-elderly-in-pgi/articleshow/86179884.cms||Shimona Kanwar

Both of them had checked in as a married couple under false names. The boy and another friend were present when the girl jumped from the roof following a dispute over a social media post, SP Satyendra Shukla told reporters on Monday. CCTV cameras at shops in the busy locality captured her fatal fall. Police have arrested the boy and the manager of the hotel under IPC 305 for abetting the suicide of a minor. It carries the death penalty in the range of punishments. Police have said they may add more charges as the investigation progresses. The juvenile is two months short of turning 18. The teenagers, Ujjain residents, had checked into the hotel on Sunday, where a second boy later arrived to meet them, said police. The girl’s boyfriend suspected her of having a relationship with the other boy, and confronted her in the hotel on Sunday. The squabble escalated and the boyfriend allegedly slapped the girl in anger. She immediately jumped off the ledge, said investigators. “We have collected CCTV footage and recorded statements of pilgrims staying at the hotel to establish that the boy slapped the girl after a heated argument, and she jumped off the roof,” said the SP. Additional SP Amrendra Singh said, “We have taken the hotel manager as a co-accused in abetment of suicide case. There is no evidence linking the boy’s friend to the suicide.” The manager has been booked under IPC 188 for violating the rules of checking in guests and not informing the administration. “Under Section 305 of IPC for abetment of suicide of a minor, the accused can get capital punishment or life term in jail or imprisonment up to 10 years,” advocate Mudit Maheshwari told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/teen-affair-ends-in-tragedy-girl-falls-to-death-after-fight-in-hotel/articleshow/86182160.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Heavy rain activity till Tuesday likely, says Met||MUMBAI: The continuing wet spell for the month has already ensured that the normal September rainfall for the city has been covered. This is in contrast to last month which ended comparatively dry. While there have not been any extremely heavy rain days this month so far, sustained rain activity has ensured that the required normal rainfall for the month is covered up. The Met department has said that heavy rain activity in short spells is expected to continue till Tuesday after which only moderate rain can be expected. The required September rain stands at 327.1 mm while so far 407.4 mm has been recorded till Monday. Last month, 338.4 mm of rainfall was recorded — much below the normal which is 546.2mm. However, in June and July, the city recorded above normal rainfall for the months. The Met has issued a ‘yellow alert’ for Mumbai and Thane for Tuesday, indicating heavy rainfall at isolated places being very likely. For Palghar, an ‘orange alert’ has been issued, indicating ‘heavy to very heavy’ rainfall at isolated places being very likely. From Wednesday, rainfall is expected to ease with only moderate rainfall forecast. Shubhangi Bhute, scientist, IMD Mumbai, said that owing to the deep depression in the Bay of Bengal and low pressure area which now lies over south Gujarat region, parts of the state have been recording good rainfall. “Mumbai, Palghar, Thane and Raigad will get good rains due to this and hence an orange alert has also been issued for some of the areas,” said Bhute. In the 24 hours until 8.30 am on Monday, the Met’s Colaba observatory recorded 25.8 mm of rainfall while its Santacruz observatory recorded 39.4 mm of rainfall.  On Monday maximum temperature at both observatories dipped to 28.2 degrees Celsius. Lakes supplying water to the city had total water stock of 98% of requirement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-heavy-rain-activity-till-tues-likely-says-met/articleshow/86182181.cms||Richa Pinto

The tally of active patients had climbed above 10,000 on September 3. The tally had come down below 8,000 in August too, but it stayed above the Monday’s count. On February 22, a total of 7,376 active cases were present in PMR. Health officials said daily cases in both Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad civic limits have remained below 5,00 each since September began, besides the cases in rural parts have not reported any alarming rise. Data by the district health office has revealed that the number of recoveries stayed above new cases on seven days since September 3, leading to a drop in active caseload. The daily cases did not climb above 1,000-mark in PMR in the last 10 days, while recoveries stayed above 1,000 on five days, the data showed. “We are expecting similar trend of decline in active cases in the coming days too. During the ongoing festivities, we urge citizens to stay more alert and avoid unnecessary gatherings,” a health department official said. Sanjeev Wavre, assistant health chief, PMC, said, “The number of active cases in the Pune civic limits had increased up to 2,400 to 2,500 two weeks ago. This tally has, however, dropped below 2,000 again. On Monday, the PMC areas had 1,905 active cases. We are keeping a close watch on the daily cases and positivity rate as well. People are advised to undergo testing in case of Covid-19 symptoms.” Experts from the health sector said the next few days would be crucial in terms of cases because of the festive season. “We are monitoring the cases in the rural areas. Concentrated efforts are being taken to contain the spread and help bring down daily infections. The testing of suspected patients has been intensified,” an official from the district administration said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmr-active-cases-decline-25-in-10-days-to-hit-over-six-month-low/articleshow/86182137.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Chandigarh||Now, Hry is accused of omitting 447 Covid deaths in its bulletin||Chandigarh: Even as the dust of omission of 356 active patients from the September 8 bulletin is yet to settle, Haryana health authorities are now being accused of omitting 447 deaths in the state Covid-19 bulletin. According to information, a district-wise compilation of data recorded by districts till September 8 suggested that the total death count of the state to be 10,133. However, according to the bulletin released from Haryana health headquarters it was 9,685 on September 6 and it came to 9,686 on September 8. No new deaths have been added in the past five months. The health authorities are patting themselves on the back about zero deaths in the past six days. However, by late Monday night, the death audit committee of the health department had cleared and added 121 deaths to the state bulletin. ACS health Rajiv Arora said the audit committee is probing the other omitted deaths. “While, according to our official count, nearly 389 deaths do not tally in district and state data. Of which, 121 have been added to the state bulletin. We will clear the rest as well,” he said Earlier, Haryana health minister Anil Vij had said the matter has been referred to the death audit committee. He promised that the committee will ascertain and clear the details and if required the data will be revised. Initially, the discrepancy was detected in active cases when health authorities had omitted 356 active cases from its bulletin, bringing down the count from 646 to 290. Reliable officials in the health department claimed that both the anomalies had come to light two months ago and the there had been a number of communications being exchanged within the various wings of the department as well as from headquarters to district units. “Though the headquarters had been asking us to make corrections in our records, it was not possible as the bulletins are published the next day. What has been done in Chandigarh, this is not in our knowledge,” a senior health official associated with Covid management in one of the districts said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/now-hry-is-accused-of-omitting-447-covid-deaths-in-its-bulletin/articleshow/86182142.cms||Manvir Saini

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Pain disorder, fibromyalgia, on the rise in the metropolis||MUMBAI: In the last few months as the city struggled with Covid's second wave, doctors noticed an increase in the number of patients coming in with complaints of fibromyalgia, a painful condition not easy to diagnose or treat. “In the last two months, I have been getting six new patients with fibromyalgia every week,” said rheumatologist Dr Dipti Patel from Wockhardt Hospital, near Mumbai Central railway station. While the virus itself may not be the trigger for fibromyalgia, the instability and emotional upheaval people suffered due to Covid could be the reason. Dr Patel said while taking down the patient's history, she found almost 40% of them had suffered from Covid three or four months before the fibromyalgia symptoms came up. “Most of them are young, more women than men, and work long hours from their homes,” she added. Fibromyalgia is painful disorder characterized by non-specific pain, mostly in the shoulders, joints, elbows, chest, etc. Patients have trigger points which, when pressed, causes severe pain. Many patients with fibromyalgia also suffer from ‘memory fog’ or constant fatigue syndrome. Dr S S Mohanty from KEM Hospital's orthopedic department said tests done on such patients rarely showed any abnormality. “But their pain is around for months and they have specific trigger points across the body,” he said. The economic and emotional upheaval caused by the Covid pandemic could be the trigger leading to a surge in cases, said experts. Neurologist Dr Rajesh Benny from Fortis Hospital, Mulund, however, said it’s difficult to link Covid with fibromyalgia. “There is no exponential rise in fibromyalgia cases due to Covid. We know that strokes or bell’s palsy cases increased due to Covid, but that cannot be said about fibromyalgia. Not all aches and pains are fibromyalgia,” Dr Benny added. Fibromyalgia isn’t easy to diagnose as there is no single test or scan that can detect the disorder. It is diagnosed by testing for other diseases and eliminating them one by one. While its causes are still not clear, genetics and viral infections play a role.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-pain-disorder-fibromyalgia-on-the-rise-in-the-metropolis/articleshow/86182265.cms||---

---||Kolkata||West Bengal Heritage panel push to beautify, maintain Toru Dutt’s grave||KOLKATA: Grave concerns of litterateurs have prompted the West Bengal Heritage Commission (WBHC) to seek permission from Bishop Paritosh Canning, head of CNI-Kolkata, which looks after the Maniktala Christian Cemetery, to put up a testimonial on its wall for author Toru Dutt who lies buried there. Dutt, who died prematurely at 21, was the first Indian to have written a novel in English and the first Indian woman to have written a French novel. Dutt, regarded as India’s Keats, was described by British scholar Edward J Thompson as “one of the most astonishing women that ever lived, a woman whose place is with Sappho and Emily Brontë, fiery and unconquerable of soul”. “Aru and Toru Dutt were the founding figures of Indo-Anglian literature. It’s important that their final resting space is properly maintained,” WBHC chairperson Suvaprasanna said. The grave of Toru DuttThe cemetery is currently a picture of neglect, littered with unkempt foliage and even used syringes. On a sunny day, locals often dry clothes while kids enjoy a game of cricket inside the enclosure where the Dutts lay buried. “In 2019, the process of generating funds for its upkeep had begun. Last month, we had a meeting of the Maniktala Burial Board. The Bishop is trying to get funds to start repairing the wall to prevent encroachment,” said Sanchita Biswas, secretary of the Maniktala Burial Board. Litterateurs believe a stone plaque will draw visitors only if there is proactiveness in the cemetery’s maintenance. Ranajoy Bose, managing member of the Christian Burial Board of Kolkata, was shocked when he visited the cemetery on Easter and then again for the burial of a relative there on August 15. “Despite my prior initiatives through the ‘Bishwakosh Parishod’ to renovate the tombs of the Dutt sisters, the cemetery is perennially covered with tiger grass and heavy undergrowth. Due recognition and capacity utilization of free grave spaces can turn it into a tourist destination,” he said. Prosanto Chunder Dutt, whose great grandfather was Toru Dutt’s second cousin, said: “My great, great grandfather, Kylas Chunder Dutt, and Toru Dutt’s father, Girin Chunder Dutt, were first cousins. I would be very grateful if any organization comes forward to improve the situation.” Not just Toru Dutt, this cemetery is the resting ground for L M Banerji, the first Indian to be appointed the professor of surgery at the Calcutta Medical College. His patients included Tagore and S Radhakrishnan. Biswas’ father and grandfather, too, are buried there. “We hope that this work will be done by All Souls’ Day on November 2,” Biswas said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/heritage-panel-push-to-beautify-maintain-toru-dutts-grave/articleshow/86179944.cms||Priyanka Dasgupta
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Night nakas help cops nab criminals||KOLKATA: Night nakas, meant to enforce movement restrictions from 11pm to 5am in Kolkata, have helped police net seven criminals over the past weeks. Lost property, like bikes and illegal weapons, have also been seized from them. On Saturday and Sunday, cops checked 975 vehicles and prosecuted 384 for breaking night restrictions; 278 people were prosecuted for breaking Covid norms and 926 others were caught for not wearing masks properly. Most of these arrests were carried out in August and September, said Lalbazar sources. Baki Billa alias Kochimoni was arrested by the Anti-Burglary Squad and almost the entire stash of stolen gold and silver ornaments was recovered in a theft case based on information when he was stopped at a naka. Similarly, during checking on the basis of information, Syed Baba Mazar was arrested for carrying a country-made improvised single-shot firearm. Recently, a midnight naka check near Bypass Dhaba had also led cops to a man who was allegedly posing as a senior Bengal government officer and a member of the Supervisory Committee of Waqf Board. The accused has been identified as Golam Rabbani (40), a resident of Suresh Sarkar Road in Beniapukur. “The nakas have primarily been set up to stop people from violating night norms. But on several occasions, the added presence of cops on the ground has helped us nab wanted men. They may have been pinpointed based on information, but nabbing them on the go has become easier due to the setup,” said an officer. Local police stations have been asked to carry out special night checks daily between 11pm and midnight, though the number is reduced post midnight based on daily instructions from Lalbazar. The night checks are being carried out at areas including Park Street, Shakespeare Sarani, Park Circus, Ballygunge crossing, Gariahat, Cossipore, Shyambazar and Sinthee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/night-nakas-help-cops-nab-criminals/articleshow/86179963.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Pimpri Chinchwad municipal commissioner Rajesh Patil said, “So far, we have completed 25-30% of the project work, including erection of pillars in the riverbed and associated work from the Bopkhel village side. As of now, the work has stopped as we were waiting for the MoD’s final sanction. Our aim is to complete the project by the end of 2022. We will fulfil all conditions mentioned in the sanction letter in due course.” Bopkhel resident Ramchandra Ghule said completion of the bridge at the earliest is important as residents have been having a hard time since 2016. “Earlier, it would take a 2km drive via the CME campus to reach Dapodi, but now it takes more than a 15km detour to reach areas in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad,” said Ghule. Resident Vijay Kalosia said the situation is especially inconvenient for working professionals and students who have to travel to Pune or Pimpri Chinchwad every day. The project, estimated to cost Rs55 crore, is crucial for Bopkhel residents who visit Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad for daily work. In September 2018, the MoD granted in-principle nod to the transfer of land in lieu of an equal value land, which the district administration gave to the defence estate office (DEO) near Dunkirk Lines off the Pune-Ahmednagar road. The DEO and the Army Southern Command had forwarded their recommendations to the MoD for final sanction. In anticipation of the same, the PCMC started the initial construction work of the bridge from Bopkhel side which falls under its jurisdiction.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/mod-gives-final-sanction-to-land-transfer-for-bopkhel-bridge-project/articleshow/86182236.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Pune||Pune: Low pollution during lockdown linked to warmer seas, say studies||PUNE: Three recent studies from the Indian Institute of Technology Bhubaneswar, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Pune, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, and the ministry of earth science Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services have linked last year’s Covid-19 lockdown in March to an abnormal increase in the surface temperatures of both water bodies. The IIT Bhubaneswar and IISER Pune study, exploring the impact of lockdown, said a decline in pollution aerosols over the Bay of Bengal last year caused the sea surface temperatures (SSTs) to warm up by 0.3 degree celsius and up to 1.5 degree celsius in certain pockets. V Vinoj, lead researcher at IIT Bhubaneswar, told TOI, “Strict lockdown measures last year reduced pollution which caused an average 30% warming in the Bay of Bengal. Oceans have a long memory and a warming event could have implications for regional weather, including increase in extreme rainfall events.” When aerosols scatter solar radiation, they have a cooling effect as they reflect a chunk of the solar radiation back to space. “With a reduction in these aerosols during lockdown because there were less industrial and transport activities, more solar radiation could reach the ocean surface, causing the warming,” Vinoj said. “Pre-existing high summer SSTs, climate change enhanced ocean heat content and lockdown induced decline in aerosols and clouds, can be the perfect ingredients for intensification of any cyclonic activity. We are still studying this aspect and may come up with more conclusive findings soon,” Vinoj said. Cyclones are much more likely to gather intensity over warmer waters. Heating of the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal is deeply connected to the recent intense cyclones and extreme rainfall events in India, scientists and an intergovernmental panel on climate change have said. IIT Bhubaneswar is also studying the effect of the lockdown on cyclone Amphan that barelled through West Bengal in May 2020. Warming of the sea surface temperatures in the lockdown period over both the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal was also studied by IIT Kharagpur and INCOIS. Jayanarayanan Kuttippurath, scientist from Centre for Oceans, Rivers, Atmosphere and Land Sciences at IIT Kharagpur, said the primary productivity of the Indian Ocean decreased during the lockdown period due to an increase in sea surface temperatures in the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. An increase in SSTs also affected chlorophyll blooms and primary productivity of the seas. Lead author of the study, Sunanda N, said primary productivity is crucial in food web dynamics, including marine fisheries. “A decrease in productivity in the ocean can have huge impacts on marine life and those who depend on it and affect the ocean's ecology,” she said. Kunal Chakraborty, senior scientist from INCOIS, said less pollution aerosols can reduce the deflection of solar radiation which then could have increased the temperature of the Indian Ocean during the lockdown period. This study analyzed the primary productivity of the Indian ocean for the period 2003–2019, and for 2020 to examine the impact of Covid-19 lockdown. Researchers divided the 2020 into pre-lockdown ( January 1– March 24), lockdown (March 25–June 7) and post-lockdown (June 8 -30) time-frames. Both these studies were published in the international journal Frontiers in Marine Science.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/low-pollution-during-lockdown-linked-to-warmer-seas-studies/articleshow/86182276.cms||Neha Madaan

Senior police officials said this year they have given permission to only 250 Ganesh mandals and the number of permissions granted are marginally higher than last year. ACP (crime) Navalnath Tambe said among 250 permissions, 35 were given to residential societies. Last year too, only 188 Ganapati mandals had organized the celebrations owing to the pandemic. “Celebrations have been a low-key affair right from the beginning. The police have also barred devotees from visiting Ganapati pandals for darshan and have appealed to the mandals to start online darshan for the devotees,” he said. Apart from Covid-19 pandemic, a large number of people are in the grip of viral fever, dengue, chikungunya, this year. Hence, not many mandals were inclined towards organizing the Ganesh festival. Police officials said they were keeping a close watch to ensure that all the government guidelines were being followed by the Ganesh mandals so that there is no spread of Covid infection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/250-ganesh-mandals-get-police-nod-in-nashik/articleshow/86177412.cms||Santosh Sonawane

The state government has extended the facility to those who have to travel abroad for urgent reasons, like availing treatment for any health problem, foreign nationals who have to return to their country and in any other circumstances in which foreign travel may be unavoidable and mandatory 84 days period after the first dose of vaccination for Covishield has not elapsed. Haryana health minister Anil Vij said the government had issued a letter to all civil surgeons of the state for relaxation of time between first and second dose of Covishield for additional categories. In the previous instructions issued regarding the provision of 2nd dose of Covishield with relaxed time (less than 84 days), the facility was for those citizens who had to travel abroad for education, employment or official purpose and those participating in Olympics. Now, the concerned individual may be asked to produce a copy of the travel documents such as visa or confirmed tickets, along with any such other documents that may justify the urgency for undertaking the travel. Feature for providing on-site second dose vaccination to such beneficiaries at government Covid vaccination centers already existed in the Cowin portal, Vij added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/foreign-travel-haryana-eases-vaccine-norms/articleshow/86182251.cms||---

Johnson Wahl passed away "suddenly and peacefully" at a London hospital on Monday, the newspaper said, citing a statement from the family. Downing Street did not respond to a request for a comment. Representatives of the family could not be immediately reached. Johnson had described his mother as the "superior authority" in the family during the Conservative Party’s annual conference in 2019. "I am going to quote that supreme authority in my family - my mother, and by the way for keen students of the divisions in my family on matters of the EU, I want you to know that I have kept the ace up my sleeve - my mother voted 'leave,'” Johnson said then. According to the Telegraph, Johnson Wahl was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease at the age of 40. "I try to paint every day if I possibly can, though I have to go to the hospital a lot. I still manage to paint, though my arm will suddenly do a movement which is completely unintentional and that almost brings me to tears," she told the newspaper in an interview in 2008.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/charlotte-johnson-wahl-mother-of-uk-pm-johnson-dies-at-79-report/articleshow/86185747.cms||---

In a September 3 order, Justice Anuja Prabhudessai had noted that the victim, who was three-year-old “at the time of the incident” in 2017, and six-year-old when deposing during trial, had said she had “forgotten it”. Hence, “it is prima facie doubtful whether the child of such tender years was a competent witness,” said Justice Prabhudessai. The man, allegedly a painter, was accused of and convicted under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act. The prosecution said that in May 2017, the child complained to her mother about pain, and when prodded by her mother, she confided saying the accused, who was working in the next room, had made her sit on his lap and touched her while another man, a co-accused in the case, had “slapped her”. In April 2019, the special Pocso court in Mumbai convicted him. The HC said the trial court judge held him guilty “mainly on basis of evidence of the victim” and had “not put any questions to her to ascertain whether she had the capacity to understand and give rational answers.” The HC order said, “Considering the nature of evidence and the fact that the maximum terms of sentence is 5 years, this is a fit case to suspend the sentence pending disposal of the appeal.” He was released on cash bail of Rs 20,000, with direction to report to trial court once in six months till the appeal is finally disposed of. (The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-suspends-5-years-jail-by-trial-court-grants-bail-to-pocso-convict/articleshow/86182309.cms||---

Over the last three to four months, the two had frequent quarrels as Giri suspected her of having an affair with another man.” “On Sunday night, Giri reached the woman’s house in a hatchback, driven by his friend, and asked her to accompany him for dinner. She agreed and got into the car. As they approached the new Katraj tunnel, the two had a heated verbal exchange,” Kalaskar said. He said, “Giri suddenly stabbed the woman in the chest and fled from the spot. His friend then called an ambulance to take her to hospital.” The victim passed away soon after she was taken to the hospital.

---||Mumbai||Testing drops amidst festivity, Maharashtra’s daily tally goes below 3,000||MUMBAI: Blame it on the weekend effect or the Ganpati festivities, but the daily tally of Covid cases in the state dipped to under 3,000 on Monday. This is the first time in nearly 216 days. The city's total dipped to 345. The state reported 2,740 cases, lowest since February 9 (2,515). A dip in fatalities was also reported at 27 deaths, lowest since March 8 (22). With this, cumulative tally has crossed 65 lakh and fatalities have touched 1,38,169. In Mumbai, cases have been under 400 for three days now (361 on Saturday and 357 on Sunday). Active cases, too, fell from 5,244 on Sunday to 5,033 on Monday. Daily test positivity rose to 1.3% with only 25,581 tests done on Sunday. BMC officials said fewer are getting tested due to the Ganpati festival. “Some have gone out of town and others seem to not want to interrupt the festivities with a Covid test,'' said BMC additional commissioner Suresh Kakani. While deaths were less than five for almost a month, they were seven and six over the weekend. “But the situation is under control. We experienced a slight increase in cases last week, but hopefully cases will stabilise,'' he said. However, a BMC doctor said cases could rise to 600 daily in coming days as people who travelled to Konkan for festivities return home. BMC has told ward officers to ramp up daily testing to around 60,000. During the festival, Covid-19 testing has plummeted. As per BMC data, on September 10, the civic body did around 50,000 tests, which dropped to 29,849 on Sunday and 25,581 on Monday. Total tests across state in last 24 hours dropped to just above 1 lakh, lowest in the last few months.

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat high court grants businessman Birju Salla five-day bail||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Monday granted five-day bail to Mumbai-based businessman, Birju Salla, who is serving life imprisonment under the amended anti-hijacking laws, for grounding a flight by planting a threat note in October 2017. The court allowed Salla’s plea with a condition that he would not stay at a hotel. While granting interim bail to the convict with a police escort of a PSI and two armed constable at his expenditure, the bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice V D Nanavati made it clear that he would not insist on staying at a hotel. “You will not stay at Oberoi, Sheraton, Taj or Leela,” the judges said and ordered his release for five days on his furnishing a solvent surety of Rs 5 lakh to the satisfaction of the jail superintendent. Salla sought temporary release citing his father’s heart ailment. The judges ordered Salla not to stay at a hotel because he was denied furlough last year after he requested the jail authority and court to allow him to stay at Hotel Oberoi. He got furlough to go to his home in Mumbai, but later changed his address of stay and insisted that he be allowed to stay at a hotel. For the change of stay, he told the jail authority and the high court that since he was granted furlough and was to be accompanied by a police escort, the many persons in the police escort could not have been accommodated in his house and he had therefore requested to stay at a hotel with the police escort. The high court ordered Salla’s release with police escort because assistant solicitor general Devang Vyas expressed apprehension that Salla might jump bail. He opposed the request for interim bail on the ground that Salla’s father has already undergone angiography and Salla’s sister and other relatives are there to take care of the patient. The judges said Salla was seeking bail on a genuine reason. Salla was convicted in June 2019 by a special NIA court for planting a threat note in the aircraft lavatory of a Mumbai-Delhi Jet Airways flight in October 2017. The court also imposed a Rs 5-crore fine on Salla. From this sum, the court ordered compensation of Rs 1 lakh each to the pilot and co-pilot, Rs 50,000 each to two flight attendants and Rs 25,000 each of the 116 passengers on board.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/birju-salla-gets-five-day-bail/articleshow/86182421.cms||---

Both were sent to jail on Monday. Julie Kumari, a resident of Vaishnavi Colony at Sandalpur in Patna City, was persuaded by the kingpin of an interstate examination solvers gang by promising her mother Babita Devi Rs5 lakh in lieu of the work. Babita accompanied her daughter to the Francis Xavier School examination centre at Sarnath, where UP police crime branch in-charge Anjani Kumar Pandey arrested them. The call details record (CDR) of Julie’s mobile phone revealed that she was in constant touch with the kingpin, nicknamed PK. A crime branch team of the UP police is likely to visit Bihar for further investigation. The kingpin is stated to be a resident of Patna. During interrogation, the mother-daughter duo revealed the names of two agents, who were working for PK in Bihar and UP. “We will soon send a team to Bihar to collect more information about the gang,” Varanasi police commissioner A Satish Ganesh said. He said the gang, operating from Bihar, has spread its network in different states, including UP. During preliminary investigation, it came to light that one Vikas Kumar, a close aide of PK, first contacted Julie’s brother Abhay Kumar Kushwaha in Patna. Vikas, a native of Bela Sikri village in Khagaria district, was aware about Julie’s academic performance in NEET-UG held in 2019. She had scored 522 out of 720 marks. She also topped in her last semester, which drew the attention of the kingpin. Vikas frequently visited Julie’s residence in Patna City. An investigating officer said Julie’s father used to sell vegetables in Patna. “The economic condition of the family is not good. So her mother was lured by the gang,” Ganesh added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bhu-student-her-mom-arrested-for-impersonation/articleshow/86180041.cms||Ramashankar
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: As blame game begins, BJP & NCP say they will field OBC nominees||MUMBAI: The Congress and BJP on Monday blamed each other after the State Election Commission declared byelections for OBC seats in six zilla parishads and panchayat samitis. After SEC chief U P S Madan declared the bypolls schedule, the BJP and NCP made it clear that since the seats were reserved for OBC candidates, they will field members from the same community. Former minister and BJP spokesperson Chandrashekhar Bawankule blamed the MVA government for the “fiasco” over OBC reservation in local bodies. “In our opinion, the MVA government has ditched the members of the OBC community. It was well within the powers of the state government to postpone the elections till the period the row over OBC reservation is resolved. We have already declared that BJP will nominate only OBC candidates to protect the interests of the OBC community,” Bawankule said. Congress spokesperson Atul Londhe blamed the BJP for its failure to provide reservation for the OBC community. “When the 127th amendment was passed, it was the responsibility of the BJP to ensure that the existing ceiling of 50 per cent reservation was removed, so that it would be possible to accommodate members of the OBC community in the electoral process. The NDA government, particularly the BJP, has done great injustice to the Maratha and OBC communities. This will create disharmony in society,” Londhe said. Londhe blamed former CM Devendra Fadnavis and the previous BJP-led government in the state for its failure to provide reservation to the OBCs, particularly enhancing the ceiling of 50 per cent. “After the 102nd amendment, the state government lost the power, still the Fadnavis government passed a resolution to provide for reservation, which was set aside by the Supreme Court. We feel that the BJP has ditched the entire OBC community for obvious political reasons. All along, Fadnavis had maintained a discreet silence,” Londhe said. NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik said the NCP had taken a decision to field OBC candidates on these seats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-as-blame-game-begins-bjp-ncp-say-they-will-field-obc-nominees/articleshow/86182387.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar

The person immediately put on the face mask but then turned violent when the photographic proof was shown to him. A civic official from the solid waste department of the ward said that the incident occurred around on Monday afternoon. “We insist on taking a photograph just in case a person refuses to pay the fine stating that they have the face mask on them,” he said.

---||Meerut||Meerut: 70-year-old stabbed 23 times by son after tiff over money||MEERUT: A 70-year-old man was beaten, stripped and stabbed at least 23 times allegedly by his younger son for refusing to part with a share in Rs 15 lakh he had recently received after selling a parcel of land on the outskirts of Meerut. Angry with his two sons, Vijay Pal Chaudhary had refused to give them the money. His mutilated body was on Monday morning recovered from the terrace of the house he shared with his sons and a daughter-in-law in Daurala area. Chaudhary’s severed hand and leg were also found near his body, police said. The brutality of the crime shocked the region and prompted police to form a team to crack the case. Police initially detained and questioned Chaudhary’s both sons. “The younger son broke down during interrogation and accepted his crime,” said Charan Singh Sirohi, head constable privy to the investigation. “Initially, the accused, Abhishant, said that some thieves had barged into the house on Sunday night and that he fell unconscious while resisting them. He also said that when he got up, he saw his father’s body in a pool of blood,” Sirohi said. “It was difficult to believe what he was saying. Then some relatives told us about the land deal of Rs 15 lakh. After the deal, he had a tiff with his two sons over sharing of the money,” the policeman added. Abhishant has been booked for murder.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/man-70-stabbed-23-times-by-son-in-meerut/articleshow/86174158.cms||Ishita Mishra

Shingne also urged the officials to crack down on adulterated food material, especially in the backdrop of the ongoing festive season. Shingne, through a video clip release, said he had instructed FDA officials to focus on the oxygen generation infrastructure, stocking, supply channels along with the availability of crucial anti-Covid drugs like Remdesivir before the onset of the projected third wave in the coming months. “I have asked FDA officials — not only in Nagpur division but also in rest of the state — to ensure the oxygen supply and medicine stocks are maintained,” he said. Shingne reviewed the current stocks of oxygen at different centres, along with availability of the anti-Covid drugs. Apart from Covid, Shingne is also learnt to have taken stock of the availability of the anti-fungal drugs for mucormycosis and other related diseases which had come in the wake of the second wave earlier this year. Shingne also laid stress on the busting of adulteration rackets, especially involved with milk and milk products, edible oil, mawa and sweets during the festive season. He has also instructed FDA officials to conduct meetings with hoteliers, restaurant owners, food manufacturers and such units to create awareness against adulteration and related laws. Shingne also asked the officials to ensure the numbers of searches and raids conducted are stepped up. “We will also address the issues of manpower availability and the current vacancies in different units of FDA,” said Shingne.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/ensure-adequate-oxygen-drug-stock-before-3rd-wave-fda-minister-shingane/articleshow/86182410.cms||---

While NSG officials said that all of them are asymptomatic and are under quarantine inside the hub, state health department officials have already reached out to them and offered help. According to sources, a bulk testing was carried out by the agency on their personnel who returned to the hub either from leave or from other units in other states last week as per the official protocol. That is when a number of personnel started testing positive to the virus. The tests were conducted at state government-run centres and after the reports started coming out, it moved the health department officials. TOI tried to contact the director of health Services for an official response, but he couldn’t be reached. Debasis Sen, chairperson of New Town Kolkata Development Authority, under whose jurisdiction the New Town NSG hub falls, said a meeting has been convened with an NSG official on Tuesday to discuss the issue. “We are going to sanitise their campus and will ask if they need any support from us. We are holding a meeting with one of their officials on Tuesday to ensure that all Covid protocols are maintained,” said Sen. A senior NSG official confirmed about the personnel testing positive but assured that the situation has come under control and that all of them are safe. “All of them are asymptomatic and none have any major discomfort. As per protocol, we tested a group of persons and also keep those coming from outside to our hub at a mandatory quarantine for 10 days. The situation is under control and there is nothing to fear,” said the official. There are around 400 officials, staff and their families in the campus. The NSG officials, being frontline workers, were administered the vaccine before it was thrown open for civilians. Doctors said that in case of breakthrough infections, there is nothing to panic. “Those, who are double-jabbed, are likely to have a mild infection. If all are vaccinated, symptoms should be mild and chances of mortality would be low,” said RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences intensivist Sauren Panja.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/covid-19-outbreak-in-nsgs-new-town-hub-26-infected/articleshow/86180125.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||India||Finalise election panels by September 30, Congress tells Sidhu||NEW DELHI: Eager to kickstart its ‘institutional mechanism’ for the upcoming assembly elections in Punjab amid disruptive infighting in the state unit, Congress has set a deadline of September 30 for state president Navjot Singh Sidhu to finalise the election committees for the approval of the central leadership. For every election, Congress states prepare several panels like the campaign committee, manifesto committee etc, which decide on the future policy vision and plan the electioneering. In Punjab, however, the confrontation between Sidhu and chief minister Amarinder Singh has emerged as a hurdle in finalising the process which marks the start of poll campaigning. Well-placed sources said an exasperated AICC has told the state unit that it should clinch the panels by September 30. They are then to be sent to the central leadership for approval and release. A key concern of the party is whether the state unit will involve the multiple factions and leaders, to make the panels participatory and inclusive. It is felt that such an approach would quell the bickering and signal to the electorate that Congress is approaching the elections in earnest. With the entire focus till now on the ‘Sidhu versus Amarinder’ headlines, Congress is eager that the party move on by taking concrete steps towards preparation for elections. “We have to announce the panels in the first week of September. It is important that the state unit proceeds ahead,” a senior leader said. While Congress was confident in going to the polls in Punjab a few months ago, the sudden outbreak of dissidence and factionalism created a crisis which ultimately led to the appointment of Sidhu as PCC chief. However, it has failed to end the confrontation as Sidhu has kept his focus on criticising the state government and targeting the chief minister. Repeated attempts to bring the top two state leaders together have failed, raising concern in the leadership about the party’s prospects. Congress is facing an aggressive campaign by AAP while Akali Dal is also making a serious bid to resurrect itself after the debacle of the 2017 elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/finalise-election-panels-by-september-30-congress-tells-sidhu/articleshow/86186426.cms||Subodh Ghildiyal

Before the pandemic, as part of the joint initiative of 11 years by the Pune Municipal Corporation, solid waste collection hand handling (SWaCH) collective and Cummins India, the SWaCH wastepickers used to engage with citizens at the river during the Ganesh visarjan for nirmalya collection. Now, they go door-to-door for the same. “In the last three years, 286 metric tonnes of nirmalya has been collected. Citizens are urged to segregate the nirmalya to include only offerings such as garlands, flowers, leaves and give them separately to SWaCH workers,”said Alok Gogate, the operations head at SWaCH. Sangita Nagtilak, a wastepicker working in the NCL colony, Pashan, said door-to-door collection was better than the earlier method. “Before the pandemic, people weren’t keen on seperating the nirmalya during the visarjan at the river. They used to immerse it in the water. Drawing them towards us and making them segregate was hard,” she said. Vidya Naiknaware, who collects waste from Taware colony on Satara Road, said, “People are careful now and when an option to not pollute rivers is available at their doorstep, they choose it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/door-to-door-collection-of-nirmalya-for-organic-compost/articleshow/86182413.cms||Ardhra Nair

No one was reported injured. The warehouse, spread over 25,000 sqft and consisting of mostly huge tin sheds storing groceries, oil, vegetables, domestic items and other goods, along with 21 electric vehicles used for transporting goods, was damaged. “A safe containing around Rs6 lakh cash was partially damaged. We searched the key from the ashes and safely removed the entire cash,” Pune fire brigade officer Gajanan Pathrudkar said. A company spokesperson said in a statement, “A fire broke out at Big Basket’s Pune godown on Sunday night between 11pm and 12pm which has resulted in the damage of most of the assets therein. Preliminary investigations indicate that it was the outcome of a short circuit in one of the bike-charging units.” It added, “Our team is undertaking a detailed investigation. Fortunately, the fire alarm got activated due to which all night shift employees could be assembled in a safe area. At Big Basket, our employees will always be our first priority in case of any eventuality...We will decide the further course of action once all investigations have been carried out and the situation has been assessed properly.” Pune’s chief fire officer, Prashant Ranpise told TOI, “Prima facie, short circuit appears to be the most likely cause of the fire.” Inspector Balkrushna Sawant of the Hinjewadi police said, “A team of fire experts from the public works department will examine the site to establish the cause of fire and is expected to submit a report relating to the same. For now, we have registered a case of accidental fire.” With assistance from MIDC, PMRDA and Pimpri Chinchwad fire brigades, the blaze was brought under control by 2.30am on Monday and cooling operations went on till 5.30am. “We managed to save over 20 three and four-wheelers,” said Pathrudkar. One of the warehouse employees at the site told TOI on Monday that the blaze started from an electric vehicle charging point and spread out to the adjacent AC cold storage unit and other areas. “There were some 10-12 people inside the warehouse as many had left on account of change in shift timing. Two security guards were also on duty,” the employee said As the fire grew in intensity, residents from Bavdhan Budruk rushed to the site and started alerting and helping those inside the warehouse move out to safer places. “The warehouse also employs many hearing and speech impaired individuals and they were moved out to safer places on priority,” said Dayawan Bandal, an eyewitness. “Soon after the fire broke out from the e-vehicles charging station, two security guards immediately started alerting the employees inside the warehouse. “One of the guards, Amol Gaikwad, also tried to douse the fire with the fire extinguishers. But, it did not prove useful. I then forced him to come out,” Bandal said. He said several light commercial vehicles were parked on the warehouse premises. “As the fire was massive, the owners of these vehicles started screaming for help. Some local residents broke the window glasses of many of these vehicles and pushed them out. It was difficult to touch the vehicles because of the heat. The villagers soaked their hands in mud and pushed the vehicles out.” Bandal’s relatives own the land on which the warehouse has been developed for storage and distribution of various items mainly to distribute in the Baner, Bavdhan, Kothrud and Shivajinagar areas. Guard Amol Gaikwad said there were cans filled with about 400 litres of diesel for generators. “We shifted the diesel outside with the fire brigade's help,” he said. The fire affected the company’s distribution work to a great extent in areas like Kothrud, Warje, Baner, Bavdhan and Shivajinagar. “My wife tried to place an order for some groceries. But she received a message that all slots on Monday are full,” Warje resident Sameer Joshi told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/blaze-destroys-bigbaskets-bavdhan-budruk-warehouse/articleshow/86182449.cms||Mihir Tanksale

However, charges will have to be paid to teach students at the hospital for five years while the contract for using it further can also be reviewed by the state government. Dwivedi said that six new medical colleges are coming up in the state but to cope with the dearth of doctors, the state cabinet decided to allow the private players to use the government hospitals. He said that they need a 300-bedded hospital for a medical college to be functional but it takes time. To start medical colleges, the infrastructure of government hospitals can be utilised. This decision was approved by the state cabinet on Monday. The chief secretary said that the decision had been taken last year but now some norms, including user charge, were amended. He said that even for setting up private nursing colleges, the state government hospital with 100 beds can be used by the private players. However, there is a norm that 25% of the seats in nursing colleges are to be reserved as government quota. Dwivedi said the steps had been taken as per the guidelines of the national medical commission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/private-players-can-use-state-hosps-to-run-med-colleges/articleshow/86180191.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||2 booked for posting derogatory remarks on Lord Ram on social media||Ambala: Haryana police have booked two persons on a complaint of hurting religious sentiments filed on behalf of Lord Rama by a resident of Naraingarh town in Ambala district on Monday. Raghav Sanjeev Gharoo of Naraingarh filed a complaint as a next friend of Lord Rama Chander, son of King Dashrath of Ayodhya in Faizabad district of Uttar Pradesh. On the complaint of Raghav, Ambala Police have booked Jung Bahadur of Jind district in Haryana and Manish Chohan of Sangrur district in Punjab under sections 295 (injuring or defiling place of worship with intent to insult the religion) and 298 (uttering words with deliberate intent to wound the religious feelings) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at Naraingarh police station on Monday. Raghav alleged that accused Jung and Manish intentionally insulted the complainant (Lord Rama) by making derogatory and baseless remarks and statements with intent to provoke breach of the peace, thereby causing public mischief and wilfully hurt religious sentiments, especially of the worshippers of the complainant. “That Shri Ram Chander is a lawful person and Raghav Sanjeev Gharu is Hindu by religion, so he wants to represent the deity as the next friend of Shri Ram Chander. Shri Ram Chander is a very famous king in Ayodhya and no description is needed for the purpose of identifying the subject matter of the dispute,” said Raghav. Raghav told police that on May 10, he had made a post on Facebook, “Those people who do not believe in Shri Ram or Ramayana, what will they know about Valmiki Ji? Such people are distributing knowledge in the name of Valmiki.” “Both Jung Bahadur and Manish Chohan posted disrespectful comments on Lord Rama and his father Dashrath,” alleged Raghav. This complaint was earlier filed with cyber crime cell, Panchkula on June 12.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/2-booked-for-posting-derogatory-remarks-on-lord-ram-on-social-media/articleshow/86182451.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Active faultline, traffic & construction destabilising Nainital: Report||NAINITAL: Horizontal vibrations from heavy traffic, rampant construction and an active faultline are destabilising the slope in Nainital, leading to recurring landslides in the region, a report prepared by a geologist and submitted to the district administration has found. B S Kotlia, professor of geology at Kumaun University, was tasked by authorities to suggest mitigation measures for landslides in Nainital. In his report submitted last week, the geologist said a faultline has been activated in the lake town, running from Governor’s House to Mall Road, where four major landslides have been reported in the last two decades. “This is evidence that the faultline is active and poses serious danger,” said Kotlia. According to the report, four major landslides have been reported in Nainital since 1998. While the first affected the DSB College Gate in 1998, it was followed by another one at Raj Bhavan in 2011. In 2018, a portion of the Lower Mall Road fell into the Naini Lake while just earlier this year another part of the road leading to the Raj Bhavan collapsed. The report argued that all landslide spots fall on a straight line that runs from Governor’s house on one end to the lower Mall Road on the other and therefore a faultline here has become active. The report added that “uninterrupted horizontal vibrations from heavy traffic and excavation done for constructing houses along the road is further destabilising the slope”. The report said the problem cannot be solved by building retention walls and has suggested use of advanced engineering techniques to minimise damage. “Just building vertical retention walls on the affected sites (throughout the city) will never work as the next landslide will wash the walls. We urgently need solutions like the ones used at dam sites (nailing, knitting and anchoring) otherwise there is no way to stop such a catastrophe,” the report said. A district administration official said temporary repair work is already being carried out at Thandi Sadak which runs parallel to the Mall Road and has recorded several landslides in the past two weeks. The area has many establishments including almost half a dozen temples, schools and hotels.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/nainital-in-danger-active-faultline-traffic-construction-destabilising-hill-town-report/articleshow/86177633.cms||Prashant Jha

The girl’s death sparked outrage against the cops as they had failed to act against the stalker Prafulla Atram (30) even after a complaint was lodged with Ramnagar police. The victim was a nurse at a private hospital in the city. Accused Atram, a labourer, had intercepted the girl while she was returning home with a friend on September 9, and stabbed her multiple times with knife. City police had admitted the girl in Chandrapur GMCH and had arrested the accused Atram, who is learnt to be married, within hours of the incident. The victim’s kin expressed anguish over the police inaction as the girl had filed a complaint with Ramnagar police on September 1 against Atram after he abused her at workplace and threatened. The cops had registered only a non-cognizable offence. “Had the cops acted promptly and reined in the accused, the stabbing incident could have been averted and the girl would have been alive,” said the relatives. Tempers ran high for some time when the girl’s body was brought home.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/minor-stabbed-by-stalker-dies-after-4-days-kin-blame-cops/articleshow/86182453.cms||Mazhar Ali

---||Pune||Pune: Experts lay emphasis on safety standards in electric vehicles and allied equipment||PUNE: Experts on Monday said government bodies should set proper standards to increase the safety and quality of electric vehicles and allied equipment, such as chargers and batteries, besides focusing on end-user awareness. Their caution comes in the wake of the Sunday night’s fire at BigBasket’s warehouse in Bavdhan Budruk off Katraj-Dehu Road bypass. “Just providing incentives will not shape the segment. More standards and certifications should be formulated by the regulators, like the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), to promote electric vehicles and ensure their safety. An accident (like the one in Bavdhan Budruk) was expected, as there have been cases in other parts of the country where batteries or chargers have short-circuited or exploded due to over-heating,” said Debi Prasad Dash, executive director of the India Energy Storage Alliance. “A number of companies import components and assemble them in India. But those components may not adapt to the Indian weather conditions. People also often charge their vehicles for more hours than is needed. The absence of a battery management system can disconnect the power supply and cause a lot of damage to life and property,” he said. Ashwini Tiwary, chief executive officer and co-founder of Autobot, an elective vehicle tech start-up, said, “Proper standards are needed for India. Besides, there are often errors in the installation and the commissioning process of a charger, which must be weeded out, by ensuring proper earthing, quality circuit-breakers or protecting the equipment from lightning or thunder. Users must also be properly trained to operate the equipment.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/experts-lay-emphasis-on-safety-standards/articleshow/86182518.cms||Shiladitya Pandit

Their other two demands—a dedicated storm water drain and a children’s amusement park—were also put forth before the civic body. On behalf of the families, a residential welfare association (RWA), Green Grace Residents Society (GGRS), represented a list of three demands to SeriLingampally TRS MLA, Arekepudi Gandhi. The RWA has invited MLA on Monday, and made an appeal to him. “The outer ring road is only a few minutes away, but due to the pothole-ridden road, the experience is unpleasant for our residents,” GGRS president, RSV Badrinath told TOI. Despite paying lakhs of rupees as tax to the civic body, it isn’t being maintained, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/road-full-of-potholes-a-menace/articleshow/86184913.cms||Sunil Mungara
---||Coimbatore||Feed Covid status of students on EMIS, schools told||Coimbatore: Schools in the district have been asked to feed status of students with regard to Covid on Education Management Information System (EMIS) - a central database with information about every student. EMIS was designed to monitor the performance of education programmes offered by the schools and to manage distribution and allocation of educational resources. “Recording the Covid status in this centralised database of students would help in keeping track of the positive cases across the state,” district chief education officer N Geetha said. Further, it will also help in effective monitoring and tracking of positive cases, she said. “All the schools are strictly following the Covid standard operating procedure (SOP) since the reopening on September 1. But the students tested positive were asymptomatic and could not be detected during thermal scanning. While they didn’t show any symptoms like cold or weakness, they were attending classes as usual like other students,” Geetha said. Speaking to TOI, Coimbatore district deputy director of health services P Aruna said that they are keeping a close watch on Covid cases emerging out of schools.With recording 204 fresh cases of Covid-19, there was slight decrease in the daily count on Monday.

---||Goa||60 years after Liberation, light finally enters Makadmare households||MARGAO: For members of the Makadmare tribe in Nirankal, Ponda, 2021 won’t be forgotten anytime in a hurry. Sixty years after Liberation, for the first time, life in the settlement won’t come to a standstill after sunset for the 20-odd families of the tribe, who are also called Wanarmare. As light literally entered their lives recently, its headman, Gopal Powar, was overwhelmed. “Our children will finally be able to study at night and pass their exams. We can now also cook food in the night or early morning, before leaving for work.” His good cheer was infectious, as the solar-powered bulbs brought joy to the lives of the old and the young. In June last year, TOI had published an article highlighting the lack of facilities for this tribe, and how darkness envelopes the settlement by sunset. The Goa human rights commission (GHRC) then took suo motu cognisance of the report, headlined ‘For the Makadmare tribe, a roof and electricity remain distant dreams’. The panel called for reports from the director of tribal welfare and the chief electrical engineer (CEE). Both these officials, in their replies, expressed their inability to provide electricity. While then director of tribal welfare Sandhya Kamat said the matter didn’t pertain to her department as Makadmare wasn’t a notified tribe, then CEE Raghuvir Keni said that the huts were made of inflammable material, and that releasing electrical connections would be “hazardous to life and property”. However, this year, the Goa energy development agency (GEDA) installed a photovoltaic (PV) solar lighting system under its remote village electrification programme that was launched on Goa statehood day, on May 30. The Makadmare settlement in Nirankal is among the 100-odd houses across the state identified by GEDA for installation of the solar lighting system. The project, which aims at achieving 100% electrification in the state, is designed with an objective to provide power through renewable energy to areas where grid connectivity isn’t feasible. But while the tribe now has electricity connections, the settlement still battles nature’s vagaries. During the monsoon — which has been increasingly unpredictable lately — their roofs are often blown off, making life miserable for residents, especially senior citizens and children. TOI had also pointed out that in the absence of toilet facilities, the tribals are compelled to answer nature’s call out in the open, inviting the wrath of locals. Since then, however, bio-toilets have been provided by the state government, and will be installed soon. Meanwhile, agro-researcher Sachin Tendulkar, who has been working closely with the tribe for their uplift, said, “This is another step in mainstreaming the Makadmare tribe into atmanirbhar Goa”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/60-years-after-liberation-light-finally-enters-makadmare-households/articleshow/86182505.cms||---
