In 2001, the American-led Western forces had come to Afghanistan to oust the then Taliban government and to hunt down Al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden, his comrades and fighters, who they accused of suicide attacks against targets in the US. "Tonight 12:00 pm (Afghanistan time) the last American soldier left Afghanistan. Our country gained full independence. Praise be to Allah. Heart-felt congratulations to all countrymen!" Suhail Shaheen, the Doha-based Taliban spokesperson, posted on Twitter. Afghanistan crisis live updatesSpeaking to reporters at Kabul airport on Tuesday, Zabihullah Mujahid, the Kabul-based Taliban spokesman, said: "We do not have any doubt that the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan is a free and sovereign nation. This victory belongs to us all. America is defeated and, on behalf of my nation, we want to have good relations with the US and the rest of the world. We welcome good diplomatic relations with them all," he said. "Taliban’s victory is a lesson for other invaders," Mujahid said.

Here are 10 regional warlords who are likely to influence the country's landscape in the coming daysWith the US withdrawl complete, the focus will now shift to how the Taliban, with sole authority, address Afghanistan’s multiple challenges, including whether they will allow other foreigners and Afghans to leave the country. Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai, the group’s deputy chief negotiator, said that those with passports and visas can go abroad "in a dignified manner and with peace of mind" when commercial flights begin. The Taliban say they want to keep the civilian airport open, but without logistical support and security guarantees it appears commercial airlines will not fly into the country.

According to Taliban and US officials, it will take a long time to put the airport back in order. Videos shared on social media showed passenger halls in disarray, broken doors, windows and ATM machines. A pilot has been reported as saying that the terminal building was trashed by passengers during the chaos of the early days of the Taliban takeover. Knowing the importance of a safe and functional airport, the group has approached Ankara and Doha to make Kabul airport operational again so that Afghanistan can stay in contact with the world. The Taliban have asked Turkey to handle logistics while they ensure security, but Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has not yet accepted the offer.

He had called and emailed the"The Taliban have made a request regarding the operation of Kabul airport. They say, ‘We’ll ensure security and you can operate it’. But we have not made a decision yet because there is always a possibility of death and such things there," Erdogan had recently stated. Many Afghans are terrified of a repeat of the Taliban’s 1996-2001 regime, which was infamous for its harsh treatment of women and a brutal justice system. The Taliban, however, have repeatedly promised a more tolerant and open brand of rule compared to their first stint in power. Clashes between NRF and Taliban in PanjshirTaliban forces clashed with National Resistance Force (NRF) fighters in Panjshir, a narrow valley of strategic importance in the country’s north. Fahim Dashti, a spokesman for the NRF, a group loyal to local leader Ahmad Massoud, son of slain Afghan warlord Ahmad Shah Massoud, said the fighting occurred at the western entrance to the valley where the Taliban had attacked NRF positions. The attack, Dashti said, was repulsed, with eight Taliban killed and several wounded, while two NRF members were injured. "Last night, the Taliban attacked Panjshir, but were defeated with seven dead and several wounded," Bismillah Mohammadi, a member of the resistance movement who had served as defence minister under exiled president Ashraf Ghani, said in a tweet. "They retreated with heavy casualties." The NRF’s claims, however, could not be independently verified.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/after-us-troops-leave-focus-on-how-taliban-will-face-challenges-ahead/articleshow/85814773.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

The state higher education department would soon release the funds to the Odisha Bridge and Construction Corporation Limited (OBCC), which will implement the project. The OBCC has already prepared the masterplan through a New Delhi-based agency. The project would reflect the Satyabadi Bana Vidyalaya, established by the famous Panchasakha — Pandit Gopabandhu Das, Acharya Harihar Das, Pandit Nilakantha Das, Krupasindhu Mishra and Godavarish Mishra — who taught patriotism, service to mankind and nationalism during India’s struggle for freedom. Official sources said the campus and other infrastructure will reflect Odia ethnicity. Traditional building materials will be used to the maximum extent possible in building construction and other infrastructure. “Around 10 acres of land has already been acquired and construction is expected soon. In the first phase, classrooms for the five schools of learning, separate hostels for boys and girls with combined strength of 160 seats, an administrative block, an auditorium, cafeteria and a library will be taken up for construction,” said an official. Chief minister Naveen Patnaik had laid the foundation stone of the university on October 9, 2018, on the birth anniversary of Utkalmani Gopabandhu Das. But the project could not make any headway in the past three years due to administrative issues. The Odia University has been planned to promote research and higher studies in Odia language and literature. It would also offer research activities on literary criticism, evolution of ancient Indian language scripts, historical scripts, archaeology, tribal language studies and regional language studies among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/odia-university-at-satyabadi-gets-administrative-nod/articleshow/85814804.cms||---

The youth claimed that he was returning to Afghanistan from Delhi via Kashmir, and had checked the route to his native place on the internet. The teen was later taken to Lakhanpur police station for questioning. Lakhanpur shares a border with Punjab and is the gateway to J&K and the Covid testing centre here keeps a record of visitors entering the Union Territory (UT). “During investigation, it was found that the youth was not carrying hard copies of his passport and visa but had digital copies of his travel documents on his phone. A preliminary probe revealed that he had come to India for the treatment of his brother, who is in the Afghan army and is currently being treated at Army’s RR Hospital in Delhi along with 10 other Afghan nationals, all of whom were injured while fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan,” said a source, quoting the detenue. “Why the youth left Delhi and who others are with his brother is a matter of investigation. We are verifying the matter with the Afghan embassy and details will be shared accordingly,” SSP Kathua RC Kotwal said. Another senior cop said: “We are trying to ascertain how and why he entered J&K.” The detention comes weeks after the Taliban’s total takeover of Afghanistan following the withdrawal of US troops from the strife-torn country. Security forces in J&K have since been on high alert to avert the infiltration of Taliban terrorists into the UT.

A fierce gunfight ensued in which two foreign terrorists were killed,” said a source. “During subsequent searches in the area on Tuesday, the body of one terrorist was recovered along with an AK-56 rifle, five magazines, 133 rounds of 7.62mm AK ammunition, four hand grenades, Pakistani currency worth Rs 13,370, and an identity card issued by the registrar-general of Pakistan, bearing the name of Muhammad Akram, s/o Sardar, r/o Pakistan,” the source added.

The two officers interacted with around 80 families of terrorists active in Pulwama, Kulgam and Shopian districts, and assured that the reformed terrorists will be provided with all types of assistance once they shun militancy and surrender. The families assured the officers that they would do their best to persuade their wards to put down arms. Earlier, at a press conference on July 31, Lt Gen Pandey had said there were around 200-225 active terrorists across the Union Territory of J&K, most of them locals.

---||Bhubaneswar||SC asks Odisha, Andhra to resolve Kotia row amicably||BHUBANESWAR: The Supreme Court on Tuesday observed that the border row between Odisha and Andhra Pradesh over disputed Kotia should be resolved through mutual discussions. Hearing a contempt petition filed by Odisha, the bench of Justice A M Khanwilkar and Justice Sanjiv Khanna made an oral observation that the issue should be resolved politically through talks between the two states. The apex court deferred hearing in the plea by six weeks. Odisha’s contention was that Andhra Pradesh had violated the Supreme Court orders of December 2, 1968 and March 30, 2006, by deciding to hold panchayat elections in the three villages of Talagaanjeipadar, Phatuseneri and Phagunaseneri in Kotia panchayat, ignoring the status quo. These are among 21 villages to which both states stake claim. They are part of Pottangi block in Odisha, while Andhra claims them to be part of Salur mandal under Vizianagaram district. Andhra Pradesh had issued notification for panchayat elections on March 5 last year and held polls in February this year. Odisha told the court that these villages are under its administrative control and in the 2019 elections, the Kotia villages had voted as part of Koraput Lok Sabha constituency and Pottangi assembly segment in Odisha. The Supreme Court on March 30, 2006, had disposed of a suit filed by Odisha in 1968, holding that Parliament alone is authorised to determine the territorial limits of states and had ordered status quo till then. Though the order had suited Odisha, which has the administrative control now, heightened political and administrative activities in the disputed villages by the neighbouring state in the past two years has rattled Odisha. While major political parties are yet to respond to the Supreme Court suggestion, Samajwadi Party’s Odisha unit on Tuesday wrote to Union home minister Amit Shah to convene a meeting between the chief ministers of Odisha and Andhra Pradesh in view of the court advice for a political solution to the dispute.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/sc-asks-odisha-andhra-to-resolve-kotia-row-amicably/articleshow/85815401.cms||---

Announcing the government’s guidelines for September, special relief commissioner Pradeep Kumar Jena said there will be no weekend shutdown in any part of the state, bringing to an end the process which had been introduced in coastal cities over three months back, on April 24, with cases surging in the second wave. As for night curfew, Jena said in September it will be from 10 pm to 5 am in urban areas only. In August, it was from 8 pm to 6 am. Ahead of the forthcoming wedding season, the government has allowed band, baja and baraat in marriages, which were banned so far. While maximum 50 people can take part in marriage processions, the hosts have to obtain permission from local authorities (district administrations or municipal authorities) for the same. Total 250 people can attend weddings as well as funerals, last rites and thread ceremonies. Till last month the cap was 25 for marriages and 20 for funerals. Community feasts on such occasions were completely banned, but no restrictions has been imposed now. Shops and malls can open from 5 am to 10 pm now without restrictions and to full capacity, but will have to follow Covid norms. The need to furnish double-dose vaccination certificate in shopping malls of Cuttack, Puri and Bhubaneswar have also been done away with. In August, malls and cinemas had a 50% cap while adults had to show double-dose vaccination certificates in Cuttack, Puri and Bhubaneswar. Public libraries, too, have been allowed to reopen by ensuring Covid norms. “The government decision to gradually unlock has been taken to strike a balance between life and livelihood. However, people must abide by Covid-appropriate behaviour to prevent spread of the virus,” Jena said. The ongoing ban on social, political and religious gatherings, however, will continue. Similarly, exhibitions, trade fairs and melas will remain prohibited.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/state-lifts-weekend-shutdown-reduces-night-curfew-hours/articleshow/85815410.cms||Ashok Pradhan

India confirms meeting with senior leader||NEW DELHI: In the first ever confirmation of an official meeting between India and Taliban, the government announced Tuesday that India’s ambassador to Qatar Deepak Mittal had met Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanekzai, the chief of Taliban’s political office in Doha. The meeting took place at the Indian embassy on Tuesday afternoon after, as the government said in a statement, a request from the Taliban side. Stanekzai is learnt to have assured Mittal that the Taliban will address all 3 major concerns expressed by India – safety and return of Indian nationals, safe passage for Afghan nationals looking to come to India and preventing Pakistan based terror groups from using Afghan territory to target India. Mittal’s meeting with Stanekzai, which lasted for over an hour, is said to be the outcome of discussions that a high-level group comprising NSA Ajit Doval, foreign minister S Jaishankar and other senior officials has had in the past few days. Official sources said PM Narendra Modi had directed that the group be formed to focus on immediate priorities for India. While this wasn’t the first meeting that Indian officials had with Taliban leaders in Doha, the earlier meetings were not announced or confirmed. Similar meetings involving Indian officials, according to official sources, have taken place on ``a few occasions’’ earlier too in Doha and elsewhere. These sources also denied that the meeting meant recognition for Taliban by India. It’s still a wait and watch approach, as a source said speaking on condition of anonymity. The meeting also followed an ``outreach’’ by Stanekzai himself last week in which he said the Taliban saw India as an important country and wanted to have better trade, political and cultural ties with it. An alumnus of IMA, and apparently known to his batchmates here as Sheru, Stanekzai was the senior most Taliban leader to have reached out to India since the Taliban takeover of Kabul on August 15. According to sources, the choice of the venue for the meeting was dictated by the fact that Stanekzai himself seemed keen to visit the Indian embassy. While Stanekzai, who is also considered close to Pakistan, continues to head the political office in Doha, there has been speculation that he might become the foreign minister. This is apparently because of his frequent meetings with heads of foreign missions in Doha. The government said in its statement, which was released immediately after the meeting, that discussions focused on safety, security and early return of Indian nationals stranded in Afghanistan and that the “travel of Afghan nationals, especially minorities, who wish to visit India also came up’’. Mittal raised India’s concern that Afghanistan’s soil should not be used for anti-Indian activities and terrorism in any manner. Stanekzai is said to have assured Mittal that these issues would be ``positively addressed’’. The meeting also came days ahead of the government formation in Kabul and within 24 hours of the departure of the last US soldier from Afghanistan. While this wasn’t the first meeting with Taliban, it’s significant that India chose to confirm engagement with Taliban after the takeover of Kabul. India never confirmed reports that an Indian delegation had met some Taliban leaders in Doha earlier this year. Reports claiming a meeting between foreign minister S Jaishankar and Taliban in Doha were strongly denied by the MEA. After the stunning fall of Kabul though, the government had dropped enough hints to suggest it was recalibrating its position to not have any engagement with the Taliban in the open. Foreign secretary Harsh Shringla was quoted as saying that India would work with any dispensation that was ready to protect the interests of Afghan people. In meetings with the US and other “like-minded’’ countries, India agreed that it was important to remain engaged with Afghanistan to ensure the government in Kabul was inclusive and one which protected women, minorities and children.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/taliban-kosher-india-confirms-meeting-with-senior-leader/articleshow/85815962.cms||Sachin Parashar

Romeo Fernandes, Sarineo Fernandes (both FC Goa) and Joyner Lourenco (Jamshedpur FC) were the first to make the move to East Bengal, while they were joined by Adil Khan (Hyderabad FC) and Daniel Gomes (Salgaocar FC) on deadline day.  The summer transfer window ended at midnight with only free agents now allowed to transfer from one club to the other.  Even though the transfer formalities are completed, East Bengal have only officially announced the signing of India defender Adil.  “I am delighted to be part of SC East Bengal. I know how passionate fans are and that is a big motivating factor for me. I am really looking forward to working with head coach Robbie Fowler. I will try and give my best for the red and gold brigade,” said Adil in an official statement.  FC Goa also confirmed the departure of Sarineo after four years at the club. They did not say where he is headed, though sources confirmed that the next stop for the left-back is Kolkata.  “Everybody at FC Goa thanks Sarineo for his contributions over the past four seasons and wishes him the very best for the rest of his career,” Goa said in a statement.  East Bengal paid a transfer fee for the services of Sarineo, a player who won the winner’s medal in Goa Pro League, Taca Goa (GFA U-20 Cup) and the Goa Police Cup.  While Romeo’s transfer to East Bengal was exclusively reported by TOI on Tuesday, the Kolkata giants took everyone by surprise when they chose to pay a transfer fee to sign Salgaocar captain Daniel Gomes.  Gomes had a year left on his existing contract with Salgaocar but the club decided to let him switch sides for an undisclosed fee.  Joyner did not have the best of seasons at Jamshedpur, playing just 153 minutes across five matches. However, the defender’s talent has never been in doubt and East Bengal have now shown faith.  Joyner’s previous spells were at Sporting Clube de Goa, Bengaluru FC and Mumbai City FC. He played 10 matches for Jamshedpur in the 2019-20 season and had one assist.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/five-goan-players-find-favour-with-sc-east-bengal/articleshow/85815973.cms||---

The resolution, which saw 13 countries voting in favour with China and Russia abstaining, said that Afghanistan territory not be used to threaten or attack any country or to shelter or train terrorists, or to plan or to finance terrorist acts while noting Taliban’s “relevant commitments’’ on the issue. Foreign secretary Harsh Shringla, who chaired the UNSC meeting, said it was important that the resolution, which was passed a day before the end of India’s presidency of UNSC, underlined the importance of combating terrorism. “It also refers to those individuals and entities that have been designated under Security Council resolution 1267 (as terrorists). And in that context I may mention that the Lashkar-e-Toiba and the Jaish-e-Mohammad are UN Security Council proscribed entities, terror entities that need to be called out, and condemned in the strongest possible terms,’’ said Shringla, adding that this was of direct importance to India. This was the first resolution to be adopted by the Council since the Taliban takeover of Kabul. According to government sources, the resolution also addressed India’s immediate concerns about facilitating travel from Afghanistan, including Kabul Airport. This will cover Indian nationals stranded in the country as well as Afghan nationals (including minorities) who wish to travel to India, said officials. The resolution noted the Taliban statement of August 27, 2021, in which the group committed that Afghans will be able to travel abroad, may leave Afghanistan anytime they want to, and may exit Afghanistan via any border crossing, both air and ground, including at the reopened and secured Kabul airport, with no one preventing them from traveling. The resolution said it expected that the Taliban will adhere to these and all other commitments, including ``regarding the safe, secure, and orderly departure from Afghanistan of Afghans and all foreign nationals’’. It also addressed issues of humanitarian assistance, human rights, inclusive and negotiated settlement. ‘’India has been in continuous touch over the last few days with key members of the UNSC on this matter. This issue was the subject of foreign minister’s phone conversation with Secretary of State Antony Blinken and high-level official contacts with other members,’’ said a source, adding that India believed this decision by the Security Council had an important bearing on the course of developments in Afghanistan. The resolution also strongly condemned the Kabul airport attacks on August 26, The resolution though also betrayed a widening schism in the Council over the approach to Afghanistan from where the US completed its military evacuation Monday. China and Russia abstained from voting with Beijing saying that the amendments suggested by them were not adopted and that China was against ``imposing’’ or forcefully pushing a resolution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/unsc-resolution-for-combating-terror-mentions-taliban-commitment/articleshow/85816071.cms||Sachin Parashar

Speaking at the White House, Biden told reporters that most of those people were dual citizens and longtime residents, who had earlier decided to stay in the country given their family roots in Afghanistan. "The bottom line is 90% of Americans who were in Afghanistan and wanted to leave were able to leave," he said. "For those remaining Americans there is no deadline. We remain committed to get them out if they want to come out."

A giant C-17 transport laden with troops and the US ambassador flew out of Kabul airport a minute before midnight local time on August 31, the deadline set by President Joe Biden.Biden said the international community would hold Taliban leaders accountable for their promise to permit freedom of travel. "The Taliban has made public commitments, broadcast on television and radio across Afghanistan, on safe passage for anyone wanting to leave, including those who worked alongside Americans," he said. "We don't take them by their word alone, but by their actions, and we have leverage to make sure those commitments are met."

Speaking at the White House, Biden told reporters that most of those people were dual citizens and longtime residents, who had earlier decided to stay in the country given their family roots in Afghanistan. "The bottom line is 90% of Americans who were in Afghanistan and wanted to leave were able to leave," he said. "For those remaining Americans there is no deadline. We remain committed to get them out if they want to come out."

Data released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on Tuesday showed GDP growth rose 20.1% in the three months to June, the first quarter of the 2021-22 fiscal year, compared with a record contraction of 24.4% in the year-ago period. It was also higher than 1.6% growth recorded in January-March 2021. Experts said while the recovery is gathering momentum, the first quarter numbers should be interpreted with some caution as the economy is still to recover lost ground after the bruising impact of the lockdows and curbs to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 infection. The latest June quarter numbers are close to the Reserve Bank of India’s forecast of 21.4%. A spate of indicators in the past few months have shown that several sectors have staged a robust rebound although some sectors, particularly in the crucial services segment, are yet to recover fully. “The Q1:2021-22 data reaffirms the government’s prediction of an imminent V-shaped recovery made last year at this time. Increase of 20.1% in GDP -- despite the intense second wave in the months of April-May -- highlights the continued economic recovery,” said Krishnamurthy Subramanian, chief economic adviser. Subramanian had been consistently maintaining since last year that the economy would stage a V-shaped recovery despite the lockdowns. The June quarter numbers are also expected to validate the government’s confidence of a sharp rebound and its pursuit of reforms to bolster growth against the backdrop of a raging pandemic. Economists said India remains one of the select few countries that have witnessed growth (year-on-year) for three quarters in a row and is among the fastest growing economies during the April-June quarter. The manufacturing sector grew 49.6% year-on-year in the June quarter, compared with a 36% contraction in the year earlier quarter while the construction sector rose 68.3%. The farm sector grew 4.5% in the three months to June compared to the 3.5% posted in the year earlier period. While several indicators have shown robust signs of recovery the overall economy still has a long way to catch up with the pre-pandemic levels. Aditi Nayar, principal economist at ICRA, said the sharp year-on-year expansion in the June quarter is analytically misleading, with a sequential slowdown of 16.9% over Q4 FY2021 and a shortfall of 9.2% relative to the pre-Covid level of Q1 FY2020.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/gdp-growth-in-q1-records-20-1-recovery-on-low-base/articleshow/85818730.cms||---

The exemption comes as a huge relief for several doctors from Kerala who are headed to Karnataka for PG NEET, the entrance exam for postgraduate courses in medicine, to be held on September 11. On Monday, Karnataka announced a seven-day quarantine for travellers arriving from Kerala, stoking concern among doctors who have opted for exam centres in Karnataka. Tushar Giri Nath, principal secretary (revenue and disaster management) told TOI that the mandatory institutional quarantine is not for those coming to the state for a short duration, such as writing an exam. If need be, we will issue another circular on the same issue,” he said. Many doctors in Kerala could not get a PG NEET exam centre in their home state and had to opt for centres in Mysuru, Udupi and Bengaluru. “The order issued by the Karnataka government has created stress among doctors who have chosen to write exams in Karnataka. In January, when we applied for the exam, the slots in Kerala’s centres were full within no time, and we had no option but to choose centres in neighbouring Karnataka,” a PG NEET candidate from Kerala said on condition of anonymity. The exam, which was scheduled in April, was postponed to September. As per the order issued on Monday, the mandatory institutional quarantine is for all travellers coming from Kerala to Karnataka. This appeared to be applicable to students returing to their colleges and for exams as well as those employed in Karnataka and returning from Kerala or those who have visited Kerala in the previous seven days before entry to Karnataka. The order said that it is the responsibility of the management or employer to enforce the quarantine. “For those coming for short duration, Covid RT-PCR negative certificate is needed irrespective of vaccination status. Institutional quarantine is only for students coming from Kerala to pursue studies here and for employees returning from Kerala to Karnataka,” said an official. However, there was no clarity on how many days would be considered a short duration. NEET PG aspirants from Kerala are likely to be accompanied by their parents too. “We are new to the city and we will have a parent with us. The exemption must be extended to them too,” said a PG NEET candidate from Kerala who has opted to write the exam in Mysuru. Bengaluru Urban district health officer Dr GA Shrinivas said NEET candidates can show their hall ticket details to authorities if asked. He added that on humanitarian grounds, along with the candidate, an accompanying adult will also be let into the state without quarantine. Night curfew in city extended till Sept 13: Police on Tuesday extended the 9pm-5am curfew in Bengaluru till September 13 as part of efforts to check the spread of Covid-19. City police chief Kamal Pant has said in an order that assembly of more than four persons in public places is prohibited during this period.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/no-quarantine-for-those-coming-to-state-for-exams/articleshow/85818787.cms||Sunitha Rao R
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Overspeeding Audi crashes into Koramangala building, 7 die||BENGALURU: Seven people, including the son of Hosur MLA Prakash Y of the DMK, were killed after the speeding Audi-Q3 they were in climbed on to the pavement and hit a building housing a Punjab National Bank branch on 80ft road, Koramangala, early Tuesday. Prakash’s son Karunasagar P, 25, was driving the car that belonged to his family and lost control of it between 1.45am and 2am. Police suspect he may have accelerated further, instead of braking, when he lost control and got onto the pavement. The vehicle had six other people: Dhanusha M, 29, a dentist; Akshay Goel, 25, a senior sales associate with a private car showroom; Rohit Ladwa, 23, working with edtech firm; Ishita Biswas, 21, working with an MNC; Uthsav Kumar, 25, an accountant with a private firm; and Bindu C, 28, a relative of Karunasagar. Barring Karunasagar, who was a resident of Denkanikottai in Krishnagiri district of Tamil Nadu, all others were staying in Bengaluru. Police said Dhanusha, Akshay, Uthsav, Rohith and Ishita were residents of a coliving space in Koramangala 5th Block. Bindu, whose family lives in Murugeshpalya, off Old Airport Road, too was said to be living at the same place. Police said the car (KA-03-MY-6666) was going from behind National Games Village junction and towards Forum Mall and the accident occurred near Mangala marriage hall on 80ft road. Joint commissioner (traffic) BR Ravikanthe Gowda said: “The high-end car got onto the footpath and collided into the building after it brought down two bollards on the footpath. The vehicle was overspeeding and none of the passengers was wearing seatbelts.” The accident damaged a makeshift Ganesha temple in the building. Traffic police on night patrol arrived at the spot within 8-10 minutes and found six passengers dead on the spot. “The seventh person passed away while being taken to hospital. This accident is a result of negligent driving and overspeeding, and we’ve invoked the appropriate sections — IPC 279 (rash and negligent driving) and 304-A (negligence causing death). We will verify if the driver was under influence of alcohol,” Gowda said. Seven people were in the five-seater – three in the front and the rest on the backseat – and this meant none barring the driver could use the seat belt. It was found that Karunasagar, too, hadn’t fastened his belt. The airbags, hence, did not get deployed. Prabhu, a park maintenance worker and witness, said: “We heard a huge noise after 1.30am. When I got close, the car was completely mangled and was emitting a lot of smoke. I feared it might explode and kept my distance. Another person brought water and poured it on the car which allowed us to inspect it. We found one of them coughing, but it was too difficult to retrieve him. Police and other help, including an earthmover, arrived.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/overspeeding-audi-crashes-into-koramangala-bldg-7-die/articleshow/85818786.cms||---

Arrested from his home in Tiruppur district — from where four of the accused have been arrested — the man, in his mid-30s, will be brought to Mysuru soon. His name was mentioned by the five other daily-wage workers who were arrested last week. His role in the crime and presence at the scene of crime is being investigated. The sixth man believed to be part of the crime is still on the run. Alanahalli police had booked six unknown individuals in the Mysuru gang rape case after police were informed about the crime on August 25. They allegedly followed an MBA student and her classmate to a secluded spot in Lalithadripura on the night of August 24 and demanded Rs 3 lakh. When the duo refused, the accused allegedly beat the classmate unconscious and sexually assaulted the 22-year-old student. With a few leads from the crime scene — liquor bottles and bus tickets — and from the account of the survivor’s classmate, police tracked the accused to Tamil Nadu on the basis of call records. Police have cordoned off the crime scene at Lalithadripura hillock in eastern part of the city. On Monday, the accused were brought to the spot to corroborate details known so far. The accused have been booked under IPC provisions related to gang rape and dacoity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/mys-rape-1-more-held-search-for-6th-man-still-on/articleshow/85818789.cms||Lawrence Milton

Karnataka has released 57tmcft of water as on August 30. The Cauvery authority meeting was held in Delhi. “We will assess the storage and inflow into four reservoirs and take a call on releasing water to Tamil Nadu,” said state water resources minister Govind Karjol. Karnataka has to release a prescribed amount of water to Tamil Nadu every month in accordance with the monthly quota fixed by the Supreme Court. But this year, the state has not been able to meet the quota due to a shortfall in rain and depleting inflow into its reservoirs in the Cauvery basin. Karjol said: “We have not been able to release water to Tamil Nadu as per the monthly quota because of dry spells in July and August. Even now, there is less storage than normal in four reservoirs in the Cauvery basin." The Cauvery authority avoided discussion on the Mekedatu balancing reservoir project proposed by Karnataka. Though Mekedatu was on the agenda, the meeting did not raise it after Tamil Nadu's representatives cited a petition by the state government in the Supreme Court seeking rejection of a detailed project report on the Mekedatu dam proposal. They said a discussion on Mekedatu was possible only if all the stakeholders — Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry — agreed on it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/cauvery-panel-asks-ktaka-to-release-deficit-28tmcft-to-tn/articleshow/85818795.cms||---

The increased pace of vaccination is primarily driven by improved supplies, while the Centre has also been pushing states to ramp up inoculation coverage, particularly that of the second dose, mainly in the wake of the upcoming festivities. While supplies are expected to improve further, the government estimates around 20-22 crore doses in September and another 25-30 crore in October. The last two months of the year are expected to receive 35 crore doses each, a senior official said. "Overall, around 185 crore doses are estimated to be supplied by December," he said. Till Tuesday morning, more than 64.36 crore vaccine doses were supplied, of which around 5.42 crore doses were balance and unutilised doses available with the states and UTs.

---||India||Rahul Gandhi, Captain Amarinder Singh differ on Jallianwala renovation||NEW DELHI/ CHANDIGARH/AMRITSAR: An awkward situation arose for the Congress on Tuesday when Rahul Gandhi slammed the makeover of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre site as “belittling of the martyrdom”, a charge appeared to be directed at PM Narendra Modi while Punjab CM Amarinder Singh approved of the changes at the iconic venue. Weighing in on the controversy triggered by the changes made at Jallianwala Bagh, which was inaugurated by PM Modi in a laser show on Saturday, Rahul posted a strong tweet virtually calling the renovation a defilement of martyrdom. “Such an insult to the martyrs of Jallianwala Bagh can only be done by those who do not know the meaning of martyrdom. I am the son of a martyr — I will not tolerate the insult of martyrs at any cost. We are against this indecent cruelty,” he said. In sharp contrast, Amarinder said the renovation work “looked very nice”. In reply to a question at a media interaction, he said: “I don’t know what has been removed. Whatever I saw that night (at the inauguration event), it looked very nice to me.” However, Amarinder added that he hadn’t seen Rahul’s tweet on the issue. The difference of opinion between the two Congress leaders comes at a time when a section of party leaders from Punjab close to newly-appointed PCC president Navjot Singh Sidhu has questioned Amarinder’s leadership ahead of the assembly elections due early next year. Some other opposition leaders, too, have been critical of the memorial’s new look. Speaking at the inauguration ceremony of the renovated Jallianwala Bagh on Saturday, Amarinder had described it as a tribute to the martyrs and a symbol of inspiration for the youth. But controversy erupted soon with the Jallianwala Bagh Shaheed Parivar Samiti (JBSPS) and even historians and politicians objecting to the facelift. They blamed the government for destroying the original features of the memorial, where hundreds had died on the day of Baisakhi on April 13, 1919. British historian Kim Wagner commented that the last traces of the massacre of April 1919 have effectively been erased. The narrow passage with stark brick walls, right at the entrance/exit of the Jallianwala Bagh that one had to cross on foot — as it was not wide enough to accommodate vehicles — does not exist anymore. Instead, there is a lane walled with shiny murals and crowded with wooden logs. The murals of human figures symbolise the common people who had gathered on the occasion of Baisakhi, defying the British diktat, which prohibited mass gatherings, and fell to bullets on the orders of Brigadier-general Reginald Dyer in 1919. A separate exit lane has been carved out for tourists. JBSPS president Mahesh Behal told TOI, “Our major objection is complete lack of originality of the entry lane, giving it a new look by plastering walls with cemented murals on both sides and closing doors and windows. There was no need to put wooden logs in the lane.” A small, cemented pyramid structure, which informed visitors that “people were fired at from here” has also been demolished. The location of Amar Jyoti or the eternal flame and the flag post has also been changed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/rahul-gandhi-captain-amarinder-singh-differ-on-jallianwala-renovation/articleshow/85818899.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Audi crash: From diverse backgrounds, six victims shared co-living space in Bengaluru||BENGALURU: The seven persons who died in a car crash in Bengaluru early on Tuesday were from different backgrounds. Apart from the politician’s son and the relative he was reportedly planning to marry, the five others included a dentist, a car salesman, an auditor, an MNC staffer and employee of an education firm. But the common thread that bound six of them — Bindu C, Dhanusha M, Akshay Goel, Rohit Ladwa, Ishita Biswas and Uthsav Kumar — was a co-living space in Koramangala 5th Block where they stayed. According to police, Karunasagar, son of Hosur MLA Prakash Y, was the only one who did not live in Bengaluru and had come to meet his relative Bindu, who was employed with a private firm in Chennai. The two youngsters were reportedly planning to tie the knot soon. Investigation revealed Karunasagar visited the co-living space around 8.40pm. “He and Bindu were seen coming out of the place around 9pm,” police said. By Tuesday evening, relatives of three victims — Karunasagar, Bindu and Rohith — had collected the bodies. Goel’s kin, from Kerala, reached the city late Tuesday. Utsav Kumar’s family flew down and took the body back to Haryana by air later in the night. Families of Ishita from Nagpur in Maharashtra and Dhanusha from Kerala are expected to arrive on Wednesday. Inconsolable kin of the victims at St John’s Hospital mortuaryKarunasagar’s death is the second tragedy in the past few months for his father. Prakash’s wife (Karunasagar’s mother) had passed away just a few months ago, police said. Krishna Kumar, Prakash’s relative who had come to collect the body from the mortuary in Bengaluru, said: “He (Karunasagar) left Krishnagiri around 5pm saying he had to rush to Bengaluru to pick up some medicines for another relative. We didn’t know that he would never return. The family has to now deal with this tragedy.” Wedding negotiations:Just like Karunasagar’s kin, Bindu’s parents also didn’t know the two were going to meet. Her father Chandrashekar said: “She had called around 8pm yesterday (Monday) and spoke to her mother. She told her she was at the co-living space and everything was fine. We didn’t know she would be going out. Early on Tuesday, we got calls from police and Karunasagar’s family about the accident.” He also confirmed that Bindu, who had returned to India after completing her masters in the UK, wished to marry Karunasagar and that the families had not yet agreed to the alliance. According to police, Bindu had been insisting that she would marry only Karunasagar although the families were not okay with it, so she may have kept her meetings with him a secret. The family said she had been working in Chennai after her return from the UK and recently shifted to Bengaluru. Orphaned all over again:Akash Ladwa, 21, from Hubballi, the younger brother of Rohit Ladwa, was aghast over the turn of events. The brothers had lost their parents when they were very young and had to depend on the benevolence of relatives to get through life. “Rohit decided to work soon after he completed II PU. As the salary was not enough in Hubballi, he moved to Bengaluru 18 months ago. We had no idea an MLA’s son was his friend or that any of Rohith’s friends had a car,” Akash said. Amruth Kalaburgi, Akash’s cousin, said Rohit had called him a couple of days ago. “He had not visited Hubballi in over seven months. He had told me he would apply for leave and come home for a week,” Amruth said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/6-victims-shared-co-living-space/articleshow/85819387.cms||---
---||Bengaluru||Audi crash: Ditching seatbelts may have cost youths dearly, say Bengaluru experts||BENGALURU: For many citizens, seven deaths involving a high-end car came as a shocker. Fatal accidents involving such vehicles, and that too within city limits, are rare. Police have categorically said the accident was caused due to negligence and because safety rules were flouted. Among other things, the vehicle was carrying more people than it was designed for, none inside the car had put on seatbelt and the driver was overspeeding, all of which should have been a strict no-no, according to experts. The five-seater Audi Q3 35 TDI Quattro, which costs more than Rs 40 lakh, has a 1968cc diesel engine with at least four airbags, none of which got deployed on Tuesday because the passengers weren’t wearing seatbelts. In fact, apart from the driver, who was the only one occupying a single seat, none of the others could have managed to wear a belt as six of them were crammed in four seats. “...If seatbelts are not worn, the car thinks that there are no passengers and airbags don’t get deployed. In some models, the driver’s airbag gets deployed upon impact of a crash, even if s/he is not wearing a seatbelt. One has to look at what specifically happened in this case,” said Nikil Jonathan, an automobile expert. St John’s Hospital, which handled all the seven victims, said they were brought dead. Dr Raghavendra R, associate professor, department of forensic medicine at the medical college hospital, told TOI: “All of them suffered blunt force injuries, which are caused when an individual comes in contact with any broad, hard surface. There were multiple consistent injuries seen in the chest, abdomen, limbs and head. They had haemorrhages in the chest and abdominal cavities. The speed at which the vehicle was moving must have been very high.” Raghavendra recalled that in a similar accident in 2014, four people sitting inside a four-wheeler died. MP Shyam, president, Federation of Automobile Dealers’ Association (Karnataka chapter), said: “This has not happened on the city outskirts or highways/flyovers, but at the city centre. I cannot recollect any such accident that claimed so many lives in the city. Germany-made cars are strong, but this incident is mainly due to negligent driving.” Like police, even experts feel the driver may have been overspeeding and that not wearing seatbelts cost them dearly. “Had they put on seatbelts, some lives could have been saved. We request all passengers to wear seatbelts,” Shyam said. Waseem Memon of Drive Without Borders, an NGO, said most of these accidents in city limits involve high-end cars. “In this case, they flouted almost all norms, making it a perfect recipe for disaster. They were clearly driving above 100kmph and could have hit another vehicle or a pavement-dweller, endangering other lives,” Memon said. Santhosh Varghese, an automobile enthusiast, while pointing out that the amended Motor Vehicles Act makes seatbelts mandatory for all passengers, said the authorities should ensure everyone compulsorily follows this rule. “Most high-end cars have four or more airbags. It was a head-on collision with a concrete structure at high speed, plus the vehicle was overloaded. So, there was little chance of anyone surviving,” Jonathan added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ditching-seatbelts-a-costly-mistake/articleshow/85819389.cms||---

As of 7pm on Tuesday, more than 28 lakh people of the nearly 79.7 lakh who’ve got the first dose in the district have got both jabs. That is, nearly 76% of the target population has been covered with one dose. Comparatively, more than one crore of the nearly 3.2 crore people who have got the first jab in Karnataka have been fully inoculated. A break-up of data from Bengaluru Urban shows that in BBMP limits involving 198 wards across eight zones, more than 69 lakh, or 73%, of the over 94 lakh target population have got the first dose, and nearly 26 lakh of them (27.3% of the target population) have been fully inoculated. The remainder of the district — five taluks of Bengaluru north, Bengaluru south, Kengeri, Yelahanka and Bengaluru east spread across nine municipal corporations — has a target population of more than 10.6 lakh. However, the number of first dose recipients in this area stands at 10.7 lakh or 100.9%. Officials said people from neighbouring areas have also been getting vaccines at PHCs and other hospitals which has taken the total to more than the target population. And, of these 10.7 lakh people, more than 3.1 lakh have got both doses. District-wise data also shows that aside from Benglauru Urban, 11 other districts — Chikkamagaluru, Chikkaballapur, Chitradurga, Dakshina Kannada, Hassan, Kodagu, Kolar, Mysuru, Ramanagara, Udupi and Uttara Kannada — have also exceeded the state average when it comes to those who’ve been fully inoculated (see graphic). But northern districts like Belagavi, Bagalkot, Kalaburagi, Ballari, Koppal, Dharwad and a few other districts fare poorly, indicating a skewed vaccination drive. KV Trilok Chandra, health commissioner, had said last week that the state’s focus would now be to achieve a more equitable vaccine coverage. As reported by TOI earlier, the state has managed to administer more than one crore doses in August — a record — and is aiming to give two crore jabs in September. Health minister K Sudhakar has said that the state aims to achieve 100% vaccination by December but did not elaborate if it was only covering people with the first dose or both.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/27-of-bluru-target-popn-fully-vaccinated/articleshow/85819391.cms||Chethan Kumar

On taking oath, she not only followed in her father E S Vankataramiah’s footsteps to the SC, but like him will go on to become the CJI in September 2027. She would be India’s first woman Chief Justice since the SC came into existence 77 years ago. Credit for creating so many records on a single day goes to CJI N V Ramana and other collegium members Justices U U Lalit, A M Khanwilkar, D Y Chandrachud and L N Rao. They selected the nine unanimously on August 17 and the Union government approved the recommendations within a record 10 days. Justice Nagarathna spoke a few poignant words to TOI. “I, as a judge, should exercise restraint and imbibe rectitude”. She understands that she will be under the constant scrutinising gaze of citizens all along her six-year long journey culminating with the top post in judiciary. First among the women judges to take oath was Justice Hima Kohli, who began her career as an advocate practicing in the Delhi HC and in 2006 became a judge there. This year, she was appointed chief justice of Telangana HC. The third woman judge to take oath was Justice Bela Madhyurya Trivedi. She was appointed Gujarat HC judge in 2011 and was transferred the same year to Rajasthan HC. She was transferred back to Gujarat HC in 2016 and had recently taken the Gujarat government to task for laxity in controlling the pandemic. With these three, the SC would have a record four women judges at the same time, including Justice Indira Banerjee, who was appointed as SC judge in 2018. The first woman judge in SC was Justice Fathima Beevi. She too had traversed the long winding path of starting her career as a trial judge and getting appointed as SC judge in 1989. The country so far has appointed only 11 women judges, including the three who took oath on Tuesday. From among the nine new SC judges, three — Justices Vikram Nath, Nagarathna and Pamidighantam Sri Narasimha — would go on to become CJIs in that order. Other new judges are Justices Jitendra Kumar Maheshwari, Chudalayil Thevan Ravikumar and M M Sundresh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/9-supreme-court-judges-take-oath-on-a-day-of-many-records/articleshow/85819446.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra

The bench of Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice Ninala Jayasurya considered the grounds raised in the PIL, contending the location fixed by the state government for the offices of Lokayukta and SHRC in Kurnool. Earlier, in another petition which sought directions to set up the office of SHRC within Andhra Pradesh, the high court had said that it is the prerogative of the state government to decide the location. However, senior counsel DSNV Prasad Babu raised additional grounds, and argued that shifting of the offices of Lokayukta and SHRC from Amaravati to Kurnool is in violation of the status quo order given by the high court on three capitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/lokayukta-shrc-offices-subject-to-adjudication-of-pil-ap-hc/articleshow/85813736.cms||Srikanth Aluri

The project was designed with a 308 tmc capacity but came down to 215 tmc by 2011 and it is feared would go down further due to silt formation. CWC took up the study following apprehensions about storage capacity of the major irrigation and hydro-electric project located at AP and Telangana border. Srisailam project is the first major irrigation dam after Krishna river enters the state. According to project engineers, the latest capacity might not be more than 180 tmc, which could further intensify the water war between AP and Telangana.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/srisailam-survey-to-fix-storage-capacity/articleshow/85813741.cms||Samdani MN

The Panchmahal police had made yet another seizure of demonetized currency on Saturday night. Four persons including two teachers were detained and questioned in connection with the seizure. It were the teachers who had promised to exchange the scrapped notes with valid ones. The teachers Nilesh Patel and Rangit Patel, both residents of Lukhawada in Limkheda taluka of Dahod district, had promised Badiya Ninama from Dahod that they would exchange the notes. The teacher duo was to take a cut for doing the job. Ninama was to meet the teachers at Gadhchundadi village near Godhra in Panchmahal. He was on his way to Gadhchundadi along with one Rakesh Bhuriya in a SUV when he was nabbed by the local crime branch of Panchmahal police that had received information regarding currency. Scrapped currency amounting to Rs 48.8lakh was seized from the duo. Nilesh and Rangit were also held near Gadhchundadi. Police sub-inspector I A Sisodiya said that Bhuriya had claimed that he was given the notes by his brother. What is surprising is that Bhuriya and his brother are not involved in any business that would generate black money. Sisodiya said that they used to work at construction sites. “The notes would have been useless even for the teachers as they would not have been able to exchange it anywhere. The RBI has stopped doing so long time back,” said Sisodiya.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/notes-scrapped-in-2016-still-priceless-for-exchange-agents/articleshow/85811121.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||BJP can kill to win UP, Karnal officer has RSS links, says Tikait||Chandigarh: Farmer unionist Rakesh Tikait, who on Sunday claimed that ‘Sarkari Taliban’ had taken over the country, has now called the BJP "the most dangerous party, which could eliminate a senior Hindu leader in order to create a Hindu-Muslim divide for winning the Uttar Pradesh elections." Addressing a kisan mahapanachayat in Sirsa, Tikait also alleged that Karnal subdivisional magistrate (SDM) Ayush Sinha, who in a video was seen instructing the cops to "smash the head" of protesting farmers on Sunday, was linked to a senior functionary of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), of which the Bharatiya Janata Party is regarded as a political wing. "The BJP is the most dangerous party as of now," said Tikait, adding: "The real leaders who made this party have been put under house arrest," He minced no words in abusing the government and its representatives as "Sarkari Taliban in the Centre and the state". He said: "The SDM behind the Karnal lathi charge is nephew of a senior RSS functionary. The officer is the first commander of these Sarakari Taliban." On Prime Minister Narendera Modi’s target of doubling the farmers’ income by 2022, Tikait said: "He hasn’t clarified whose crop will benefit —the companies that take huge loans, declare bankruptcy, and get a pardon or the farmer whose land is auctioned if he defaults on loan? State election year 2022 is not far and the lies of PM Modi will stand exposed now." He also compared the price of stocked apple with the rates of the fruit procured from the farmers of Himachal Pradesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/bjp-can-kill-to-win-up-karnal-officer-has-rss-links-says-tikait/articleshow/85816658.cms||---

---||Business||LIC’s asset base goes past Rs 38 lakh crore in fiscal 2021||MUMBAI: Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) of India has said that its asset base has crossed Rs 38 lakh crore with total investments of Rs 36,76,170 crore and a life fund of Rs 34,36,686 crore as of March 2021. According to its balance sheet for the previous fiscal ended March 2020, the corporation’s total assets stood at just under Rs 32 lakh crore, total investments at Rs 30.7 lakh crore and its life fund at Rs 31.1 lakh crore. LIC shared its balance sheet numbers ahead of its foundation day on September 1, which marks its 66th anniversary. The balance sheet numbers provide some insights into the value of the IPO-bound corporation. However, a clear indication will be available only after it reveals the embedded value of its business. The expansion in the balance sheet in the pandemic year FY21 occurred on the back of a 3.5% growth in new business (first-year premium) with a collection of Rs 1.8 lakh crore premium from 2.1 crore new policies. Assets also grew with pension and group superannuation collecting Rs 1.3 lakh crore as new business premium. The corporation also settled 2.3 crore lakh claims amounting to Rs. 1.5 lakh crore. The sales give LIC a market share of 66.2% in first-year premium income and 74.6% in number of policies. Another landmark achieved during the year was the use of digital channels for payment of nearly 75% of the total renewal premium. This was a major jump from FY20 when premium collection through the alternate channel was 61.9% in policies and 54.8% in volume out of the total renewal premium collection of LIC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/lics-asset-base-goes-past-rs-38l-cr-in-fiscal-2021/articleshow/85817414.cms||---

---||Business||PayU buys payments co BillDesk for $4.7 billion||MUMBAI: In a deal that will make PayU the biggest online payments processor in India, its parent Prosus will acquire BillDesk for $4.7 billion (close to Rs 35,000 crore). A pioneer in the payments gateway space, BillDesk was founded in 2000 by M N Srinivasu, Ajay Kaushal and Karthik Ganapathy. BillDesk is the largest facilitator for payments of bills online, while PayU has leadership in e-commerce payments. South African internet and media giant Naspers, which has built a large presence in the online space through a spate of acquisitions, is a majority stakeholder in the Netherlands-based Prosus. Prosus holds Nasper’s fintech, e-commerce and other international investments outside South Africa, including PayU. Its acquisitions in India include Redbus and CitrusPay in 2016 for $130 million. It is the largest investor in Swiggy and is best known for its 28.9% stake in the Chinese giant Tencent. Prosus CEO Bob van Dijk described the acquisition as “transformative for PayU”. He said that the two companies complement each other in business and it provides the scale necessary to be efficient in the payments business. Market watchers say that it will give the firm the ability to deploy analytics and artificial intelligence and get into digital lending to retail. Prosus had been pursuing BillDesk for several years and had appointed PJT Advisors — a boutique Wall Street investment bank where Pramit Jhaveri is a senior adviser — and Avendus much before BillDesk hired Morgan Stanley. This is the largest deal in the Indian payments space. It is in keeping with international trends. Earlier this month, the Jack Dorsey-co-founded Square had acquired ‘buy now, pay later’ payments company Afterpay for $29 billion. According to a filing by IndiaIdeas.com, the company that owns the BillDesk brand, as of March 31, 2020, General Atlantic is the largest investor with a 14.8% stake and Visa International is the second-largest investor with 13.12% (see graphic). The promoters Srinivasu, Kaushal and Ganapathy hold 11.39%, 10.59% and 8.84% respectively. The other large private equity investors are TA Associates’s arm Wagner (13.66%), Temasek subsidiary Claymore Investments (8.87%), and Clearstone Venture (6.68%). With this deal, PayU’s combined investment over the past five years crosses $5 billion. The combined entity will have a total payment value of $147 billion and increase the number of transactions managed by PayU fourfold to 4 billion. For the investors, BillDesk has been a derivative play on the growth of e-commerce in India. “We have a long and deep relationship with India, having supported and partnered with some of its most dynamic entrepreneurs and new tech businesses since 2005. We’ve invested close to $6 billion in Indian tech to date, and this deal will see that increase to more than $10 billion,” said Dijk in a statement. “Along with classifieds, food delivery, and education technology, payments & fintech is a core segment for Prosus, and India remains our number one investment destination,” he added.PayU CEO Laurent Le Moal said that the acquisition will help stimulate innovation and competition and also promote the government’s objective of financial inclusion. According to the RBI’s FY21 report), the number of transactions for digital retail payments has grown by more than 80% from 24 billion in 2018-19 to 44 billion to 2020-21. BillDesk co-founder Srinivasu said, “BillDesk has been a pioneer in driving digital payments in India for well over a decade. This investment by Prosus validates the significant opportunity in India for digital payments that is being propelled by innovation and the progressive regulatory framework put into place by the RBI, India’s central bank.” The deal size reveals the appreciation in value the company has seen in the last few years. Visa’s minority stake investment in the company valued it at $1.8 billion as recently as November 2018. Online payments have received a big boost — first in the push to digital payments following demonetisation, and more recently after the pandemic emphasised social distancing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/payu-buys-payments-co-billdesk-for-4-7bn/articleshow/85817377.cms||---

Rohtas SP Ashish Bharti said Heemani, who was currently posted as the executive officer of Bodh Gaya Nagar Panchayat, was arrested by a team of Sasaram Town police station from Sherghati in Gaya. Former chairperson of Sasaram Nagar Parishad, Kanchan Devi, is already languishing in Sasaram district jail in connection with the three cases. Heemani was earlier suspended by the state government in April 2020 for dereliction of duty after the matter had come to light. Her suspension was later revoked. Rohtas police sources said Heemani had been evading arrest for the last three months and she had filed anticipatory bail petitions in a local court in Rohtas. On Tuesday, a team from Sasaram Town police station raided the residence of Sherghati BDO, who happens to be her husband, and arrested her. Police said three separate FIRs were lodged between August 2020 and March 2021 with Sasaram Town police station by the assistant engineer of Bihar Urban Infrastructure Development Corporation (BUIDCO), Jitendra Singh, and the then executive officer, Abhishek Anand, in connection with embezzlement of government funds to the tune of Rs 55 lakh. The three accused in the cases were Heemani, Kanchan Devi and Arvind Kumar, a former junior engineer in Sasaram Nagar Parishad. According to sources, the three were accused of fraudulently withdrawing Rs 55 lakh in December 2019 in the name of construction of a PCC road. However, an on-the-spot inquiry by a team of district administration revealed that no PCC road was built. Incidentally, among the four women chairpersons of Sasaram Nagar Parishad since the introduction of reservation in 2012, FIRs were lodged against three for embezzlement of government funds and two had to go to jail. In 2016, the then nagar parishad chairperson, Nazia Begum, and two ward councillors were arrested by the vigilance department in connection with embezzlement of Rs 5 crore meant for installation of streetlights in Sasaram town.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/ex-official-of-sasaram-civic-body-in-police-net/articleshow/85812036.cms||Alok Chamaria
---||Business||Cos that care for employees will attract, retain best talent||By Nimisha DasConsider the post-pandemic world. Our way of working is altogether a world apart from what we knew it to be over a year ago. A sea-change, as the one we witnessed naturally, would alter what employees expect from employers. But the burning question is, what makes for a great place to work in the post-pandemic era? More importantly, are employers equipped to meet employees’ evolved expectations head-on? Safety and care: Evolving benefits When push came to shove, the unwavering resilience of employees paved the path for many organisations to not only survive the pandemic but also emerge stronger. Now, as we come around after a devastating second wave, employees will seek organisations that are genuine and visible in how they care for employee safety and earmark investments for making their workspaces secure. Employees would also seek organisations that provide holistic care — physical, financial, and mental wellbeing support — through policies and practices. With the escalating medical costs that are impacting employees, structuring of insurance and other health benefits that an organisation would provide becomes critical. To really understand what is of value, organisations would need to be agile and check in with employees to understand what’s important to them as this is something that would be constantly evolving. Emergence of a trust field The outcome of expectations infused by the pandemic into employer-employee relations will last long. The employer-employee dynamic will advance from a command-control setup to a trust field. This field is crucial in establishing flexible ways of working in an organisation. It will determine whether the flexible working policy remains in letter only or is embraced and practised as a culture. There are some crucial success elements for operating with trust. The first is empowering with support, which includes the right information and right tools & systems that employees require for doing their job. The second is people-centricity that puts employees at the top of the organisational strategy. It means weaving policies and ways of working that are pro-flexibility and would even require capability building for managers to operate effectively in remote working. The third element is personalisation — creating a culture that delivers tailored employee experiences, especially as teams become more diverse. Understanding organisational offering In the post-pandemic era, a critical consideration for employees would be to know of organisations that offer an internal environment that take into account the changing reality. This is where having a well-crafted employee value proposition (EVP) comes to the fore. An EVP is an employer’s promise to potential talent, and I think of it as a talent magnet. It attracts individuals with an ethos and aspiration that are aligned to the organisation. That makes for a potent combination for success. A well-articulated and executed EVP not only engages employees and shows purposefulness on the employer’s part, but also leads to lower attrition and higher retention. At Kellogg, we recently launched an EVP, which is ‘Nourish Your Great’ that allows one to be themselves, make a mark, and do a world of good. Most importantly, an EVP creates evangelists out of employees and positive word of mouth is the most powerful validation an organisation can receive from its people, more so in the post-pandemic world.

Over 15 lakh jobs have been lost in the state in the last one year. The NDA government had promised to create 19 lakh job opportunities. What happened to its promise? The so-called double-engine government has ruined the state’s present and future,” Tejashwi tweeted. Meanwhile, RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s elder son Tej Pratap celebrated Janmashtami at his residence at midnight on Monday. He also made a video call to his father to show him the grand celebration. Tej, a devotee of Lord Krishna, organised bhajan-kirtan, rudrabhishek and distributed prasad among people. “Lord was born to defeat the evil and he will take rebirth in several forms to conquer the evil. One who spends time in prayers and worship becomes successful in life,” Tej told mediapersons. “My father goes to bed at 9pm. However, he remained awake till midnight on my request,” Tej claimed. Lalu was earlier upset with Tej for creating nuisance in the party and lashing out at senior RJD leader and party’s state president Jagadanand Singh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/tejashwi-slams-bihar-govt-over-unemployment/articleshow/85814195.cms||Sheezan Nezami

The roads and civil engineering department have drawn up a list of 450 battered roads that need to be repaired before October 5. A KMC roads department official said the civic body would primarily focus on the major arterial roads which have developed craters following spells of heavy rain. The department is waiting for a prolonged dry spell before starting the drive. “We need a fortnight to wrap up repair of the roads which have developed craters due to incessant rains,” said a KMC roads department official. Among the roads that will receive a fresh asphalt coating include Chittaranjan Avenue, APC Roy Road, Bidhan Sarani, Mahatma Gandhi Road, BB Ganguly Street, Strand Road, AJC Bose Road, Asutosh Mukherjee Road, Shyamaprasad Mukherjee Road, Diamond Harbour Road and a few others.  Cops, too, have made a list of stretches that need repair. These include Silpara stretch on Diamond Harbour Road near SB Park puja, Ultadanga underpass near Telengabagan-Karbagan pujas and Garia 5 and 6 number bus terminus near Garia Naba puja. KMC BoA chairman Firhad Hakim on Tuesday said the civic body would meet Kolkata Police traffic department before the drive begins.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/kmc-to-repair-450-bad-roads-before-puja/articleshow/85814293.cms||---

This is the scene prevailing in the flood-ravaged villages of Balua Thori and Sisahi panchayats under Madhubani block,” former mukhiya of Balua Thori, Banarsi Yadav, said on Tuesday. He added, “The panchayats are located between two streams of the Gandak river. Only country boats are source of communication. Their plight is that little boats are banned by the administration and the big boats are not available.” In Semara-Labdeha panchayat under Piparasi block, over 200 flood victims have moved out of their houses and taken shelter at safer places, such as rail bund and even in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh. “The relief distribution teams have not reached these villagers,” former mukhiya Chhedi Lal Prasad said. A flood shelter camp of the panchayat, made with huge investment, has been lying locked, he added. Over two dozen families of Kanti tola have been rendered homeless. Meanwhile, Bagaha circle officer Rajiv Ranjan Srivastava said a community kitchen has been running at Chakadahawa Government Primary School under Valmikinagar police station and 850 flood victims are being provided free meal since August 27. The animals of Valmiki Tiger Reserve have deserted their dens and entered residential areas in the adjoining areas. Reports said they have been damaging the standing crops. Meanwhile, the water level of several north Bihar rivers has been falling. The water discharge through Valmikinagar Gandak barrage was 3.07 lakh cusecs in the morning, but it fell to 2.69 lakh cusecs at 5pm. Similarly, the water discharge through Birpur barrage across the Kosi also fell from 2.11 lakh cusecs in the morning to 2.06 lakh cusecs in the afternoon. However, Bagmati, Kamla and Burhi Gandak continued to flow above the danger level along their downstream. On the other hand, the Ganga was flowing slightly above the danger level at Gandhi Ghat in Patna, but the water level has begun to rise from Hathidah to Kahalgaon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/no-end-to-miseries-of-flood-hit-west-champaran-people/articleshow/85815046.cms||Abhay Singh

---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Liquor sales soar, foil efforts at prohibition||VIJAYAWADA: The state government’s ambitious plan to implement complete prohibition in a phased manner by reducing consumption is yet to yield positive results. Liquor sales this year have so far recorded a 60% rise in terms of revenues and more than 100% in terms of volume, compared to the corresponding period last year. The YSRC government introduced a new liquor policy soon after coming to power and announced its plan to implement complete prohibition by reducing the number of outlets in a phased manner. Retail liquor outlets were downsized by 33% in two phases. The state government also increased prices of liquor by up to 50% to discourage alcohol consumption. After the first round of reduction in number of shops, there was a reduction in sales. But revenues did not come down even after the decrease in sales due to an increase in liquor price and the imposition of an additional retail excise tax (ARET). The state government, however, has said that its plan of complete prohibition has been yielding results as liquor sales have fallen by 30% and beer sales by 50%. But this trend appears to be reversing as sales have increased phenomenally in 2021 compared to 2020, even with fewer shops. There was an increase of 104% in liquor sales till August 2021 when compared to the corresponding period of 2020. Beer sales have gone up by a whopping 199% in 2021. While liquor sales were hit in 2020 due to the Covid-19 lockdown, curfew restrictions also had a significant effect in 2021. But with sales continuing to grow this year, there has been an uptrend even in a month-on-month comparison over the last four months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/liquor-sales-soar-foil-efforts-at-prohibition/articleshow/85812122.cms||Srikanth Aluri

The investigating officers informed magistrate Karunakar Reddy that Satyam and Rahul’s business associate Korada Vijay Kumar was the mastermind behind the murder and interrogating him will reveal more facts pertaining to the case. The petition sought 10 days custody of the accused citing other facts and reasons behind the crime that need to be established. While the magistrate expressed the same opinion of the investigating officers, he adjourned the hearing to Wednesday to hear the defendant’s response. Satyam, an industrialist who is also involved in multiple murder cases, was arrested by Vijayawada police from Bengaluru airport last week. So far, 11 of the 13 accused involved in Rahul’s murder have been arrested and produced before the court. Rahul was allegedly killed by Satyam’s henchmen. He was found dead in his car on the morning of August 18 near Manor Plaza on Tikkle Road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/cops-file-custody-petition-in-bizman-murder-case/articleshow/85812297.cms||---

The state government’s income from various sources has increased by 36% in the period from April to July this year, as compared to the same period last year. Significantly, compared to the corresponding period last year (2020), the revenue from stamp duty and property registration has spiked 148% in the period from April to July this year, reflecting a huge spurt in real estate transactions since April this year. In the month of July, 2020 which was just after the lockdown, the income from stamp duty & registration fees was Rs 588 crore. In July this year, the income from stamp duty and registration touched the Rs 968 crore mark. Considering the April to July period, the revenue from stamp duty and registration in 2020 was Rs 1,234 crore. This year, the income from stamp duty and registration between April and July stands at Rs 3,061 crore. Such impressive has been the stamp duty and registration revenue that the state government has earned 34% of its annual budgetary target of Rs 8,700 crore in the first four months of the financial year. According to official figures of the state government, the number of property documents registered in the first four months of 2020-21 were 1.94 lakh, which increased to 4.07 lakh in the first four months of 2021-22, reflecting a whopping 110 % jump in total number of registered sale deeds in the state. However, the state’s major source of income - Goods & Service Tax (GST) income has grown by only 6% in the first four months of the ongoing fiscal year as compared to the same period last year. Revenue from stamp duty and registration grew by 148% in the first four months of the present fiscal year as compared to the same period last year. Motor vehicles tax has registered a growth of 110% in the first four months of the financial year as compared to the corresponding period last year.

A landslide in Saki Naka injured one man the previous night. Some low-lying areas, such as subways, saw water-logging on Tuesday. In Palghar district, three youths who were being swept away in the flooded Jai creek in Gholvad were rescued by locals. The police said the condition of one of them was stated to be serious and he had been moved to a hospital in Umergaon. Around 100 villagers from Dundiyapada, Babultalao and Marwad in Bordi, Dahanu, were shifted to government schools as heavy rain flooded the villages and cut them off from urban areas. Food packets and drinking water were given to the villagers, who were told to spend the night in the schools. The BMC disaster management cell said that at 10.43pm on Monday, rocks and soil fell on a public toilet in Saki Naka and injured one person, Jivasacha Shah (47). He was taken to the BMC-run Rajawadi Hospital, treated and discharged. Two landslides in July had claimed 29 lives in Mahul and Vikhroli. In the Bharat Nagar slum of Mahul, 19 people died and five were seriously injured in the overnight landslide. In the Surya Nagar area of Vikrohli, 10 people died. After the heavy rain on Tuesday, water-logging was reported in the Vile Parle subway. Parts of Andheri and Jogeshwari also reported water-logging. Officials said that the water was cleared as soon as the intensity of the rain reduced, though slow-moving traffic and jams were reported in many parts of the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-350-shifted-one-injured-as-rocks-rain-down-at-2-spots/articleshow/85818668.cms||Richa Pinto

I will not comment on it,” he said at the meeting of the BJP’s OBC forum at the party office here. It may be recalled that SuMo, the then deputy CM of the state, had described Nitish as a “PM material” in August 2012. Around that time, the then Gujarat CM Narendra Modi had been preparing himself to become the NDA’s PM candidate in the 2014 parliamentary elections. Nitish, in an interview given to a national daily in July 2012, had amply indicated that he would not be amenable to the idea of Narendra Modi becoming the NDA’s PM candidate. SuMo, in reply to a question from a mediaperson, had described Nitish as the “PM material” in August 2012. Its net effect was that “invisible hands” drove a wedge within the Bihar BJP on the issue. For, the party’s well-known faces like Dr C P Thakur, Giriraj Singh, Ashwini Kumar Choubey and Rameshwar Chaurasia, among others, started pitching for Narednra Modi as the NDA’s PM candidate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/sumo-mum-on-nitish-is-pm-material-debate/articleshow/85815093.cms||Abhay Singh

The Goan slender gecko is one of the smallest of the species in India. “Hemiphyllodactylus goaensis is only the eight Indian species of the genus and 44th globally,” co-authors, Akshay Khandekar, Dikansh Parmar and two others stated in a paper; “A new species of the genus Hemiphyllodactylus Bleeker, 1860,” published in Zootaxa, a zoological journal. This is also the first species of animal described from Goa University,” Nitin Sawant, assistant professor and teacher in charge of the department of zoology, Goa University (GU). Three specimens were found only in two type localities (the place in which a type specimen is found in botanical terms) - two in North Goa at GU campus and one in south at Chandor. The female specimen was spotted by a snakerescuer Rinku Kumar Gupta’s family member on a wooden curtain rod in their house on September 9, 2020 at Chandor who was surprised to find an “unusual reptile”. Parmar encountered the first specimen close to midnight on the second floor of a Goa University (GU) building on March 18, 2020. “It was on a wall outside my room – 48 feet above ground level and ten feet above floor level,” Parmar said. The third specimen was also found on the GU campus – known for its rich plant and other biodiversity, especially reptiles. Though no immediate threats are perceived to the biodiversity, widening of the major district road through the campus has increased traffic movement. “However urbanization in and around the campus needs to be regulated to maintain the unique habitat of these elusive species,” Sawant said, adding that this finding will inspire young researchers in the field. The researchers, as part of the ministry of environment and forest project on diversity of herpetofauna in Goa, Maharashtra and Karnataka are carrying out more surveys. This will help in assessing the distribution and diversity of the news species or one more such species in Goa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/in-a-first-slender-gecko-specimen-found-in-state/articleshow/85816673.cms||Paul Fernandes

He also asked the officials to complete the scheme on a priority basis in all those wards where drinking water is affected by fluoride, arsenic and iron as such contaminated water leads to different diseases. “During a visit to Khagaria in 2009, I had seen the effect of arsenic while taking a bath and drinking the water,” the CM recalled. “You can take assistance of local people or local people’s representatives where you face difficulties in execution of the tap water scheme,” Niitsh told the officials of three departments – panchayati raj, public health engineering (PHED) and urban development & housing (UDHD) which have been assigned the task of implementing the scheme. The CM asked the UDHD officials to complete the scheme in remaining wards of Gaya town as early as possible, because the state government was working fast to provide piped Ganga water for drinking purpose to the residents of the holy town. Earlier, while making a presentation before the CM about the progress made under the ‘Mukhyamantri Gramin Peyjal Nischay Yojana’, panchayati raj department additional chief secretary Amrit Lal Meena said the works in 99.06% of rural wards had been completed and the families living in these wards were being provided safe drinking water through tap. Work in the remaining wards will be completed soon, Meena informed the CM. UDHD principal secretary Anand Kishor and PHED secretary Jitendra Shrivastava made presentations about the progress made by their respective departments under the scheme. While Kishor informed the CM that 88.55% wards in urban areas have been covered, Shrivastava said the scheme has been completed in 97% wards looked after by the PHED.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/provide-tap-water-to-remaining-wards-in-bihar-nitish/articleshow/85815166.cms||---

Oyster mushrooms get ready for harvesting in 20-25 days. The oyster mushroom is sold at Rs200/kg while milky white mushroom is available at Rs300/kg and button mushroom at Rs150-200/kg,” senior scientist and head of Katihar Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK), Reeta Singh, said. “Technology-wise, button mushroom farming is tough. It also takes time and requires more input cost,” she said. “Mushroom farming is also good for landless people as well as residue crop management, besides, keeping the ecology and environment safe. The burning of crops residue such as stubble of maize, wheat and paddy causes environment pollution. But, stubbles are used in the mushroom farming,” the KVK head said, adding, “At least 1,000 families and self-help groups in Katihar have been engaged in the production of all the three varieties of mushroom for commercial purpose.” Reeta said since it does not need land, landless and needy people are coming forward to know about the mushroom production. “The KVK, Katihar, is the ‘biotech kisan hub’ where farmers of Araria, Purnia and Khagaria districts are also given tips on critical input costs, seeds and straws for mushroom production,” she said. About its medicinal and nutritional values, she said, “In the vegetarian category, soybean has maximum 42% protein content, followed by mushroom (35-40% protein). Doctors recommend consumption of mushrooms for diabetic, blood pressure and arthritis patients. The shelf life of mushroom is less. Therefore, pickles, morabba (sweets), fortification of baby food, as well as its powder form is mixed with soup and chapatis to make the diet more healthy and energy giving,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/oyster-mushroom-farming-picking-up-in-katihar-dist/articleshow/85812083.cms||---

School vans, autos and buses were seen carrying kids to schools and back home after classes. Baldwin Academy had overall 75% attendance in classes I to XII. Its principal Rajiv Ranjan Sinha said the school has cautiously restarted physical classes with full capacity after taking all the precautions. “There was no assemblies while kids had taken their lunch inside their classrooms without sharing food with other classmates,” he said. Glenda Galstaun, principal of St Dominic Savio’s High School, told this newspaper that the overall attendance was 60-62% as some of the parents were still little apprehensive about sending their kids to schools. “However, the attendance will improve gradually,” she said. St Karen’s High School principal Seema Singh said only higher secondary classes opened with full capacity. “As a precautionary measure, only senior students are allowed to attend classes on all days with full capacity as they are more sincere. For the rest of the classes, we are still following 50% capacity on alternate days,” she said. Saurabh Kumar, examination in-charge of Open Minds A Birla School, Kankarbagh, said students of classes VII to XII attended the school with full capacity and they will come on Tuesdays alternate whereas those in classes I to VI will attend classes on Mondays alternate,” he added. Students were also elated. Anuj Saxena, a class VII student of DAV Public School, said though he could not share the lunch with his best mates, he still had the opportunity to talk to them face-to-face after a long time. Shambhavi, a student of Litera Valley School said, “I kept social distancing while interacting with my friends. It was odd but best for our safety. I still enjoy spending time with my friends at school, asking questions to teachers on difficult topics. I now realise how much I missed the regular classes during the pandemic.” A student of International School, Nikhil Kumar, said the school staff checked their temperatures, while the lunch and dispersal time was different for each class. Monika Singh of Don Bosco Academy said there is no alternative to physical classes. “Now, I can at least meet my friends during the full classes,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/pupils-elated-over-reopening-of-patna-schools-at-full-strength/articleshow/85814812.cms||Faryal Rumi
---||Ahmedabad||NFSU-Gujarat kit to detect poison in VVIP food||AHMEDABAD: If you thought that employing food tasters to test for poison was a kingly practice long abandoned, then think again. Protocol demands that food offered to VVIPs including foreign dignitaries, Union ministers and chief ministers, are tasted for unintentional contamination or intentional poisoning. Since risking human lives like this is an anachronism in the 21st century, the National Forensic Sciences University (NFSU) is developing a kit that can detect a wide range of contaminants and poisons in under 10 minutes. The kit is expected to be ready by January 2022. Dr J M Vyas, vice-chancellor of NFSU, said that several states had approached the university, seeking chemical reaction-based rapid kits that would help law-enforcement agencies and other government arms conduct on-the-spot testing on food. “It is perhaps the first of its kind project for food forensics and other disciplines,” he said. Dr Jayrajsinh Sarvaiya, senior assistant professor, leads the team of experts developing the kits which include identification of contaminants and poisons in food, identification of narcotics, and identification of adulterants in milk, fertilizer, etc. using the principles of chemical reaction. How do the kits work? Dr Sarvaiya said that every chemical substance reacts to another chemical. “For example, the cyanide test will turn violet if the food sample has that particular poison. If the food has alkaloid contamination, it will give off a dark blue colour. The method includes a miniature centrifuge in which the samples are kept. Once the samples settle, the residue is tested against chemicals to check the reaction,” he said. He added that the tests have been designed keeping in mind the time factor. “The kits can test for about 40-odd poisons and contaminants, covering almost the entire gamut known to investigating agencies and forensic scientists. The tests can identify the substances within 10 minutes,” said Dr Sarvaiya. This will also save time as food tasters usually consume the food at least 30 minutes before it is served to dignitaries. Test kits will include treated paper strips The kits would also include paper strips treated with chemicals that can be used to test the given samples. NFSU officials said that the other kits would also identify contaminants from given samples of milk or fertilizers using a similar method. But in such cases, the chemicals employed would different based on the known impurities and harmful substances such as organophosphorus traces. A senior state police official, on condition of anonymity, said that food testing is always an integral part of the contingent to ensure safety of the VVIPs. “Given the high number of public events like Vibrant Gujarat summit that Gujarat hosts, a team is always deployed at the venues and at the kitchens. A chemical kit like this would surely reduce the chances of human errors, if any,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/nfsu-kit-to-detect-poison-in-vvip-food/articleshow/85815726.cms||Parth Shastri

He was delivering the keynote address at the annual conference organised by the Fixed Income & Money Market Derivatives Association (FIMMDA) and the Primary Dealers Association of India (PDAI). Das also said that the RBI will work with primary dealers to popularise STRIPS — Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities. This is a system that will enable conversion of government securities into zero-coupon bonds where a lump sum is paid on maturity. This will be one of the measures by the RBI to develop a retail market for government securities. Under the STRIPS mechanism, if there is a long-term bond for, say, 10 years, a primary dealer can sell the principal to one investor and the periodic interest payments to other investors. The advantage is that an investor looking for short-term government bonds can buy the coupon (interest) payments and a long-term investor can buy only the principal. Zero-coupon bonds are popular with investors who save for long-term plans or goals like retirement as they do not have to worry about reinvesting the interest. Das said that the intention behind introducing STRIPS was to attract retail investors. Bond dealers say that it has not taken off in retail. “Going forward, it would be desirable for the Reserve Bank and the market bodies like FIMMDA and PDAI to work together to popularise the STRIPS instrument further,” Das said. He added that besides STRIPS, the RBI has been working to promote retail participation by introducing niche products like sovereign gold bonds and savings bonds. Other steps to promote retail include allowing non-competitive bids in primary auctions and allowing trading in odd lots. The central bank has also opened up its bond market infrastructure by linking it with exchange trading systems.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rbi-to-deepen-retail-mkt-hints-at-tapering-liquidity/articleshow/85817585.cms||---

The CM also inspected the flood situation in Kusheshwar Asthan Purvi block’s Adalpur and Sahorawa village by the NDRF boat. Accompanied by state’s water resources minister Sanjay Kumar Jha and several senior officials, the CM inquired about the facilities and relief being provided to the flood-affected people camping on the nearby roads. He also visited the flood relief camp at Masankhor High School under Kusheshwar Asthan Purvi block and also inspected the temporary shelter made for the flood-affected pregnant women, community kitchen and a smart class being run in the school. He also inspected a Covid-19 vaccination centre-cum-community health centre at the Shankara Modern Public School, Gyaspura and enquired about the general OPD, eye OPD, medicine distribution centre. Nitish also provided a cheque for Rs2 lakh to Mohammad Rabbani under the Chief Minister Minority Loan Scheme and another cheque for Rs25,000 to Nazma Afreen under the Muslim Deserted/Divorced Women Assistance Scheme. He also handed over another cheque for Rs15,000 to Mamta Devi for bearing a female child at the flood relief camp. The CM asked the district officials to make necessary propaganda about availability of Covid-19 vaccines at the community health centres and ensure vaccination of maximum people every day. Later, talking to mediapersons, Nitish said his government was very serious on the flood issue and all necessary arrangements had been made to minimize its impact on people. “I assess the flood situation daily and also visit different districts to review the relief works,” he said.

The deceased was identified as Firoz Ansari, a resident of Munir Colony under Phulwarisharif police station area. His throat was slit with a sharp-edged weapon. Neura police outpost SHO Dharmendra Kumar said the police received information from some local residents at around 11am that a body was lying near the railway crossing. He said the victim’s identity was ascertained with his Aadhaar card recovered from his possession. “It seems he was killed somewhere else and the killers dumped his body near the railway crossing,” Kumar said. The deceased relatives told the police that Firoz, a painter by profession, had left home on Sunday for work. The family members started searching him when he didn’t return home in the evening. Apprehending some foul play, they contacted the victim’s in-laws at Vyapur village under Shahpur police station area in Patna rural. “On Tuesday afternoon, the police informed us,” the deceased’s kin, Khursheed Ansari, said. The SHO said the the CCTV footage was being obtained from the locality to trace the killers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/painter-found-murdered-in-patna/articleshow/85814679.cms||---

Kanpur is the only centre in the state where intranasal vaccine trials against Covid are being done. As many as 30 volunteers consisting of doctors, their family members and others were administered the first dose of the intranasal vaccine. Another 20 people will be administered this vaccine in the next few days. It would be after 28 days, the second dose of this vaccine would be administered to these 50 volunteers. All the volunteers who were administered nasal vaccine are adults, said principal investigator for intranasal Covid Vaccine, Dr JS Kushwaha while talking to TOI. He said that the doses of the vaccine administered to healthy volunteers in this phase of trial have been well tolerated and no serious adverse events were reported. However, all the volunteers are under observation. Dr Kushwaha who administered the vaccine to the volunteers, while explaining how this vaccine was delivered, said, “Two drops of the intranasal vaccine were put into each nostril of a volunteer. After a gap of five minutes two more drops were administered in the same fashion. This way a total of eight vaccine drops was administered to each person. The volunteer was then observed for any reaction for over an hour before being allowed to proceed home.” He added, “Those administered vaccines today will now report after 28 days and the same procedure will be repeated.” He also said that prior to the administration of the intranasal vaccine during the second time, saliva and blood samples will be collected for studying immunogenicity. He also mentioned that if the intranasal vaccine gets approval in future, it would be a great invention and also a huge relief for people who are scared of taking vaccine doses through injection. “The intranasal vaccine is dropped into the nostril of a person and it gradually slips into the respiratory tract. The dosage of this vaccine is repeated after 28 days just like Covaxin, which is administered twice in the same time period. The vaccine would neutralise the virus in the nostril itself and would not allow it to penetrate deep down into the respiratory tract,” Dr Kushwaha told TOI. He said that once both the dosages of this vaccine are administered to a volunteer, his/her blood and saliva samples would be collected and sent to Bharat Biotech for antibody analysis. “As of now, nowhere in the world, intranasal vaccines exist. Americans are also trying to develop intranasal vaccines and so are we. If this vaccine gets developed it would be a major breakthrough in the fight against Covid-19,” said Dr Kushwaha.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/intranasal-covid-19-vaccine-phase-2-trial-begins-in-city/articleshow/85818634.cms||Abhinav Malhotra

Santosh, son of former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi, handed over a four-point charter of demands to Scindia. He also demanded commencement of operation of Boeing aircraft between Gaya and Kolkata instead of the small ATR aircraft. To substantiate his demand, Suman said, “Buddhist devotees from south-east Asian countries arrive at Bodh Gaya in large number. The Boeing aircraft will facilitate smooth travel of such devotees from Kolkata to Gaya.” The minister added, “There is a need to restore services international flights from Gaya airport. Several national and international flights were being operated from Gaya airport during pre-Covid period when large number of Buddhist devotees and tourists from Thailand, Cambodia, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Lao and Vietnam used to visit Bodh Gaya." Suman also demanded introduction of more direct flights to Delhi and Mumbai from Gaya airport. “Gaya should be connected with Darbhanga and Patna through air route under the regional air connectivity scheme-UDAN,” he said. Air India and IndiGo airlines have been operating different flights from Gaya airport. Apart from this, international airlines like Mihin Lanka (Sri Lanka), Thai Airways (Thailand), Druk Air (Bhutan) also operate flights between Gaya and Colombo, Gaya and Bangkok and Gaya and Paro, respectively. All the international flights have remained suspended since March 23 last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/restore-intl-flights-from-gaya-bihar-minister-urges-centre/articleshow/85814950.cms||---

In the video, the man, about 30 years of age, is seen sitting and walking in the middle of Pipodara flyover bridge on National Highway 48 near Kim in Surat. This lead to a traffic jam as the man repeatedly blocked vehicles and also climbed on the roof of couple of them causing damage. One video shows the man breaking wipers, rearview mirrors and hitting on windshield of the cars. In one of the videos, the man is seen rolling on the road as he was hardly able to stand on his feet. Multiple videos of the man creating ruckus on the bridge were viral on social media. After a while, a few people got down from their vehicles and caught the man. Locals too joined in and took the man to the side of the road for questioning. When locals asked him the reason for his behaviour, he kept quiet. It is also suspected that the man might be mentally disturbed. “The man was nabbed and thrashed by people but he somehow managed to escape from the spot before police reached the spot,” said an official of Kosamba police station. He added that no formal complaint was lodged in connection with the incident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/drunkard-creates-ruckus-on-highway/articleshow/85812592.cms||---
---||Business||Bull run: Another day of sensex, Nifty highs||Mumbai: The global rally triggered by dovish comments by the US central bank’s chief continued on Tuesday. On Dalal Street, by close of the day’s session, the sensex ended 663 points up at 57,552 — the first time ever above the 57k mark. The Nifty on the NSE, too, rallied 201 points to close at a new peak above 17k at 17,132. The sensex took two sessions to rally from 56k (above which it ended for first time on Friday) and go past 57k, while the Nifty took 19 sessions to move from 16k to 17k — its fastest 1,000-point gain in history. The day’s surge also took investors’ wealth past the Rs 250-lakh-crore mark with the BSE’s market capitalisation now at Rs 252.3 lakh crore. Tuesday’s rally in the stock market — in which foreign funds played a key role by pumping in over Rs 5,000 crore in two sessions, also boosted the rupee. With the RBI mostly remaining on the sidelines, the rupee on Tuesday closed 26 paise higher at 73.01 to a dollar from Monday’s close of 73.27, and 68 paise from Friday’s 73.69. The Indian currency had increased by 53 paise on Friday on the back of huge flows after a bank raised $1 billion through an overseas bond offering. The gains on Monday and Tuesday were due to FPI flows, dealers said. The recent strong foreign flows came after these funds took out about Rs 10,000 crore net from Indian stocks since July 1 this year, official data showed. The rising rupee had mostly kept the software exporters from joining the rally. But on Tuesday, these stocks witnessed strong buying. The session’s gains in the sensex were led by Bharti Airtel, Bajaj Finance and TCS, while selling in Reliance Industries, Nestle and IndusInd Bank limited the northward movement of the index, BSE data showed. According to LKP Securities head (research) S Ranganathan, strong buying in FMCG and software biggies, along with Airtel, Bajaj Finance and Bajaj Finserv, made the market rally “look effortless” ahead of the Q1 GDP numbers (which came in the post-market hours). “Metal stocks, too, lent good support as indices soared over a percentage in late afternoon trades as the Street awaited the auto numbers” on Wednesday.Market players expect the rally on D-Street to continue on Wednesday after the government said that the Indian economy had gained 20.1% during the April-June quarter, the fastest such pace on record.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/bull-run-another-day-of-sensex-nifty-highs/articleshow/85817433.cms||---

The order was in response to a petition filed by the ministry of corporate affairs (MCA) against the bankrupt group. The MCA’s move comes in the wake of banks being able to recover only 4% of their admitted claims of Rs 64,838 crore under the bankruptcy process. The government had approached the tribunal under Section 241 and 242 of the Companies Act, which empowers the MCA to act if there is a fraud, misfeasance or persistent negligence. Responding to the petition, the tribunal has instructed the MCA to serve notices to disclose on affidavit moveable and immovable properties/assets, including bank accounts, owned by them in India or anywhere in the world. It also directed the Central Depository Services (CDSL) and National Securities Depository (NSDL) to freeze all securities held by the respondent, which include the Dhoots, the company and senior management. The Central Board of Direct Taxes has also been asked to disclose the information it has in its possession of all the respondents. The Indian Banks Association has been directed to facilitate disclosures of the details of the bank accounts, lockers owned by the respondents (numbers 2 to 6) and such bank accounts and lockers also be frozen with immediate effect. Finally, the MCA has been instructed to write to state governments and Union Territories to identify and disclose all details of immovable properties held by the respondents. Despite receiving a bid for only 4% of the admitted debt, which was close to the liquidation value, lenders had agreed to sell Videocon to Twin Star, a Vedanta company. Unlike enforcement authorities that have sweeping powers, banks under insolvency can only pursue assets of the company that has gone bankrupt. The sale was, however, stalled as the appellate tribunal granted a stay following an appeal from Bank of Maharashtra — a dissenting creditor. In its order on Wednesday, the NCLT said, “This bench is surprised with the manner in which the financial institution has come forward to grant loans to a sinking ship and again come forward to file petition under Section 7 of IBC and again supports this petition. This certainly rises the eyebrows of the common man in the public.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/nclt-orders-freezing-of-all-assets-of-videocons-dhoot/articleshow/85817481.cms||Swati Deshpande
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Krishna cops strengthen IT core team across police stations||VIJAYAWADA: In a bid to scale up technical expertise, Krishna district police have launched an ‘Each One Teach One’ initiative that aims to train personnel in using various online tools in tackling crimes across all 50 police stations under their jurisdiction. Currently, the IT Core team at district headquarters in Machilipatnam bears the burden of sharing their expertise in accessing software such as Criminal Intelligence System (CIS) and Crime and Criminal Tracking Network & Systems (CCTNS). Speaking to TOI, Krishna district SP Siddharth Kaushal pointed out that CIS and CCTNS are already available on the computers that have been given to all police stations. “The sad part is that we don’t have sufficient expertise in utilising and updating these tools. Hence, the initiative (Each One Teach One) will help in building capacity that will assist in speeding up investigations,” Kaushal told TOI. The training will also focus on tackling cybercrimes using different tools and reducing the time taken to apply for information from the sole IT core team in the headquarters. “Most of the personnel are expected to complete their training schedules in fifteen days. Based on their performance, we might extend the training,” Kaushal added. Cops point out that compared to other states, AP police lags in using digital tools in investigation with just two cybercrime police stations—one in Vijayawada and the other in Visakhapatnam—having the maximum tools. Kaushal launched the programme at Chilakalapudi police station on Tuesday where constable-rank personnel have been selected to gain technical expertise.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/krishna-cops-strengthen-it-core-team-across-police-stns/articleshow/85812235.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti
---||Goa||Our struggles, studies have all been ruined, just want to stay in India: Afghan family||PANAJI: Two years ago, when 24-year-old Arif got a scholarship under the Indian Council for Cultural Relations to do MBA at the Goa University, he came with hopes and dreams of returning to Afghanistan and contributing to his country's development. Today, his dreams lie shattered, hopes lost and all that he wants is that he and his family be allowed to work and stay in India. “Just imagine… we worked hard, studied and fought to build a democratic country in Afghanistan over the past 20 years. My wish was to return and serve my country, but everything has been ruined," says Arif. “We are not asking for any financial help. We want the Indian government to help us with permanent residence,” says Arif, whose wife joined him in India as a dependent before their daughter was born last year. “Since I’m on a student visa, I just want to be able to take up a job here as someone who has studied here and who has a daughter born here. We only request for our visas to be extended for some time, or permanent asylum,” he says. After getting his MBA degree, Arif was scheduled to return to his country to a higher post at its election commission, where he worked for a year before coming to Goa. The family had packed their bags and left for Mumbai recently for one final medical check-up for their one-year-old daughter’s heart condition, and were to proceed to Afghanistan when they heard the news of the Taliban takeover. Arif had already given an authorisation letter to another student to collect the degree on his behalf. He also deleted all photographs of him, his wife and his daughter — all taken in Goa — from social media and from their phones, fearing that on their return to Afghanistan, they would be considered "infidels". “For a modern, educated and civilised person, who has completed his MBA specialising in HR in a foreign country, I don’t see any future in Afghanistan,” says Arif, whose parents are farmers in Afghanistan. The election commission is the backbone of any democratic system, he says, and he fears the Taliban will specifically target people like him should he return, for not supporting them but the “foreign occupiers”. When his daughter Yildiz (meaning ‘star’ in his native Uzbeki) was born at GMC last July and had to undergo a heart surgery, well-wishers contributed towards the costly operation that was done in Mumbai in January this year. He worries for his daughter’s future under the Taliban, should he return. “She may not be allowed to go to school under the Taliban. We are not willing to go back, at any cost. We are just seeking help from the Indian government,” says Arif, whose monthly stipend of Rs 25,500 ended in August along with his course. His relatives have told him he is lucky to be out of the country, and he says he doesn’t trust the Taliban or believe they have changed for the better. In touch with family, he is aware of the situation on the ground. “The Taliban can easily impose their own beliefs, especially in villages where there is no internet connectivity and where people are not able to raise their voice,” he says. “My family has told me that they have started taking attendance in mosques and threatened to either beat or fine those who don’t come for Namaz five times a day. They have started giving high positions in the government to their own fighters. Just imagine the ministries being run by these religious guys.” What the Taliban is telling the media and what they are doing is very different, he says. “They want the world to recognise them and are trying to portray a good image. But see what happened at the Kabul airport. This has not happened in the last 20 years... This only proves that they have turned more aggressive and have a very hostile mind."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/our-struggles-studies-have-all-been-ruined-just-want-to-stay-in-india-afghan-family/articleshow/85816706.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Chandigarh||Vehicles without high-security registration plate, colour coded stickers to be challaned||PANCHKULA: The traffic police will start a special drive to challan vehicles which do not have high security registration plates (HSRP) and colour-coded stickers. Panchkula traffic police in-charge, inspector Sukhdev Singh asked residents to adhere to Supreme Court guidelines mandating HSRP and color-coded stickers on each vehicle under the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988. He made it clear that HSRPand color-coded stickers were mandatory not only for new vehicles but also for old ones. He asked people to visit the website, https://www.hsrphr.com online and book the HSRP and color-coded sticker after depositing a fee set for vehicle type. Blue stickers are for petrol vehicles while yellow ones are for diesel vehicles, he informed. Once the booking is made, representatives of the firm will visit the house of the applicant to fix the HSRP and colour coded sticker to the vehicle. HSRP and color-coded stickers help with vehicle identification. They also make it difficult for thieves to steal a vehicle or change the registration plate on their own as HSRP plates come with non-removable snap-on locks, which are difficult to replace. Challan drives will also be conducted for other offences like riding without helmet, without seat belt, jumping red light and driving vehicle on the wrong side or overspeeding. “People must adhere to traffic norms and follow all road safety signs while driving,” inspector Sukhdev Singh advised. BOX: The Penalty The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) made it mandatory for all vehicle owners to fix a high-security registration plate (HSRP) and colour-coded plate on their vehicles. The fine for not affixing HSRP plate on a vehicle can range from Rs 5,000 to Rs 10,000. Benefits of HSRP The prime reason for HSRP being made mandatory is that the old number plates are easy to tamper with and can be misused by thieves. However, HSRP plates come with a non-removable snap-on lock and are difficult to replace. HSRPs comprise details like engine number and chassis number in a centralised database. This data helps in identifying a stolen car. HSRP plates are only issued once the vehicle owner passes on essential details like engine number and chassis number.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/vehicles-without-hsrp-colour-coded-stickers-to-be-challaned/articleshow/85814330.cms||Arvind Bishnoi

Intensivists, nurses and medical social workers from small hospitals and small towns can do wonders to boost the country’s organ donation rate, experts said. These small hospitals should be ready to be designated as non-transplant organ retrieval centres for the organ donation rate to go up, they added. Noted intensivist Subhal Dixit, former national president of Indian Society of Critical Care Medicine, said, "Medical caregivers in small hospitals can encourage public opinion and educate others from the medical community to get families of brain-dead patients to consent to organ donation." Critical care expert Kapil Borawake added that they must be trained well enough to own the programme for a better success rate. Solapur-based surgeon Vijay Shivpuje said there is tremendous scope to push organ donation numbers in small cities and it must be explored. "We need to create awareness about organ donation not only in the general public but also encourage, train and motivate health professionals in small cities," he added. Santosh Shetty, executive director and chief executive officer of Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital, said small hospitals and small towns account for a large number of mortalities and potential brain stem deaths. Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital has tied up with TOI for the Times Organ Donation Drive. This year, the drive will recognise organizations doing commendable work in organ donation. "Potential brain stem deaths can be identified, and families can then be counselled for donation. Medical staff must be trained about brain stem death and counsellors can take care of the other formalities," Shetty said. Cross-sectoral participation for the local population, training of counsellors, incorporation in school curricula, helplines and recognition programmes, campaigns on television, print, social media, and street plays will boost the organ donation rate, medical experts said. "Once a minimum scale is achieved in smaller hospitals and smaller towns, a force multiplier effect will set in and we can reach higher donation rates at the national level," Shetty said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/big-boost-for-organ-donation-numbers-if-small-town-hospitals-join-noble-cause/articleshow/85816734.cms||---

Following this, her family has sought the city authorities, besides Foreign ministry’s help to bring her and her three children home. Samirun Nisha, a resident of Chunnan’s building located in Baghahi of Babupurwa police station area, told that her daughter Hina Khan alias Pammo used to live with her uncle in Mumbai. She used to work in a bar there, where she had met Mohammad Ghani, an Afghan national. Ghani thereafter married her daughter and started living in Mumbai. They had a son and two daughters. According to Samirun, on August 28, her daughter Hina called her on her mobile phone and narrated her ordeal to her. “She told her that she is in Kabul’s Jurmut area some 80 km from Afghanistan with her children. She said that she had been sold by Ghani to someone and he himself had escaped to Mumbai. Ghani also had harassed her a lot and now she is being tortured by the people there. Ghani, however, had left them to die in Afghanistan and himself escaped to India, where he is living in Saat Rasta Jijamata Mahalakshmi in Mumbai Central area,” said Samirun Nisha while talking to reporters. She further said that as she did not have an account in the bank, her daughter during her stay in Mumbai, where she was working in a bar, used to send her money every month through her relatives and Hina last came home (Kanpur) in 2013. Samirun said that her daughter was two months pregnant then and in the year 2014, Hina gave birth to her first child at a private hospital in Bagahi area of Babu Purwa. City police officials meanwhile told TOI, efforts to rescue Hina Khan and her children trapped in Afghanistan has started. On Monday, ADCP South Anil Kumar provided complete details to the Ministry of External Affairs. City Police Commissioner Asim Kumar Arun and DCP South Raveena Tyagi have been briefed about the whole issue, he said. ADCP said that the helpline number is being run by the Ministry of External Affairs for the Indian nationals trapped in Afghanistan. “We are in touch with the Ministry of External Affairs, help will be provided to the victim’s family. Every best possible effort will be made to bring the family back,” said ADCP further.

The SDM may or may not give the go-ahead depending on the circumstances, an official said. The post-mortem is conducted in almost all the cases where death has taken place due to unnatural causes. But in some cases, like accidental deaths, it is not compulsory and the administration can hand over the body after a death certificate issued by a government doctor. The order was passed by the district magistrate to facilitate the speedy and dignified last rites of the dead. Earlier, the families of such deceased people had to approach the station house officer, who, on his part, used to send the report to the circle officer. After the officer’s clearance, it used to land at SDM’s table. The decision was taken to avoid inconvenience to families who live in remote and hilly areas of Dehradun.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/now-sdms-in-dehradun-can-directly-exempt-autopsy/articleshow/85811725.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Mumbai||Min: Will torch booth if toll reimposed for Bhiwandi road||Bhiwandi: Upset over the poor condition of Bhiwandi-Wada Road, local MP and union minister Kapil Patil on Monday said he would himself torch the toll booth if the state government resumed collecting road tax without repairing it. Speaking at a function in Bhiwandi, Patil said internal roads in the township as well as highways are in a pathetic condition, especially Bhiwandi-Wada Road. Patil said he had learnt from state PWD officials toll collection on the “pothole-filled” road was to resume soon. He said, “If the toll naka starts without repairing it, I will first set it on fire.” Patil said Nitin Gadkari, union minister of road transport and highways, had given in-principle nod to convert it into a national highway but the plan got stuck as toll collection company moved court and Rs 500 crore may have to be given to it. To tide over it, PWD plans to collect toll, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/min-will-torch-booth-if-toll-reimposed-for-bhiwandi-road/articleshow/85811776.cms||Pradeep Gupta

The court also slapped a fine of Rs 2.76 crore on him. M Puzhalendhi, of Hosur in Krishnagiri district, did not appear before the court on Tuesday and so the court issued a non-bailable warrant against him. Police said Puzhalendhi started a firm, Maze Group of Technology, at Hosur in Krishnagiri district in 2010. M Raja, 27, from Chinnalapatti in Dindigul district, was his business partner. The company lured depositors stating that those who invested in the company would get double of the invested amount within ten days. As many as 86 people deposited Rs 4.96 crore and the duo cheated them the same year. Subsequently, one of the investors, A K Chinnasamy, of Gobichettipalayam in Erode district, lodged a complaint with the crime branch police in Krishnagiri district. The police registered an FIR against the firm, Puzhalendhi, Raja and five other staff members of the firm. Later, the case was transferred to the economic offences wing, Salem, which registered a fresh FIR and arrested Raja and Puzhalendhi. Raja did not appear before the court during the trial and he went absconding. Five staff of the firm were acquitted from the case. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/man-gets-10-years-in-jail-for-cheating-investors/articleshow/85816790.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The paid parking contractors will come with details and data of works they have completed so far as well as their plan for the near future. Other officers concerned will attend the meeting, the first between the new MC commissioner and paid parking contractors of the city. Making the announcement during the monthly general house meeting on Tuesday, MC commissioner Anindita Mitra said, “A detailed report has been prepared on paid parking comprising all the issues. I am going to hold a meeting with paid parking contractors on Wednesday to discuss related issues in this regard. Action will be taken in cases of violation in paid parking lots.” Chaos broke out in the previous monthly general house meeting held on Tuesday, as councillors of the opposition party, Congress, blamed the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for mismanagement in paid parking lots and absence of smart features. Heated arguments broke out between mayor Ravikant Sharma and opposition councillors Devinder Singh Babla and Satish Kainth. Both of them went to the well of the general house assembly while protesting against anomalies in paid parking lots of the city. Replying to the issue, mayor Ravikant Sharma said that paid parking contractors were being constantly penalised for violations and not making the lots fully smart. He also slammed the opposition over alleged mishandling of the lots. The issue of absence of smart features in paid parking lots cropped up when adviser to the administrator Dharam Pal discussed the issue in detail and raised questions on the management of the parking lots and their failure to install smart features.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/mc-commissioner-to-meet-paid-parking-contractors-today/articleshow/85814399.cms||Deepak Yadav

When the school did not return the money, the student’s father filed a case in the consumer commission. The District Consumer Commission had ruled against the school on July 5, 2019. The commission had asked the school to pay a compensation of Rs 10,000 besides refunding the fees. The British school filed an appeal against this decision with the state consumer commission, which upheld the decision of the district commission. Rahul Pathania of Sector 44 had lodged a complaint in the district consumer forum two years ago, saying that he got his daughter admitted in Class IX in August 2018. He deposited admission fee of Rs 77,300 in the school. Later, he felt dissatisfied with the environment in the school and got his daughter enrolled elsewhere. When he asked the British school to refund the fees, the school refused. At this, Pathania lodged a complaint in the Consumer Commission. The school defended itself saying that Pathania got his daughter admitted after reading the admission form well and he had been told that the fee would be non-refundable.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ut-school-to-refund-over-rs-80k-admission-fee-to-student/articleshow/85814461.cms||Shimona Kanwar
---||Kolkata||Suman cars parked on footpath in New Town 31.08.21||Kolkata: New Town is facing a new kind of problem of footpath encroachments. Cars being parked on footpaths in the township, partially or totally obstructing the pavements in several places of the township, creating inconveniences for citizens. Locals complain that often cars are being parked on the longish footpath and pavement infront of apartment housings. The problem is mostly seen inside the blocks where there are mostly cooperative housing societies. A section of residents complained that whereas Sufal Bangla stalls that was doing business for a few hours on the pavements as many people were buying vegetables from them have been barred by NKDA to sit on the footpath citing encroachment reasons, how can cars are being allowed to be parked on pavements.  “Most of the cooperative housings only have that much of space for its residents to park only their own private vehicles. Often with pavements having adequate width, people are choosing to park their cars on the footpath and not on the road side,” said a resident. “It is a problem which is growing up. A few days ago a sort of altercation and problem had occurred over such parking a car upon the pavement. This issue should be looked upon,” said Samaresh Das, a New Town resident and chairperson of New Town Forum and News (NTFN), an umbrella organization of residents’ forums in New Town. “We can work on to conduct awareness campaign on this matter to spread the message not to damage the footpaths by parking cars on it,” said Ankur Roy Chowdhury, NTFN vice chairman and another resident of the township. Officials of the New Town Kolkata Development Authority (NKDA) conceded that it was a growing concern in the township which they were looking into. “It is a growing concern. Our staff along with the Bidhannagar traffic police inspectors we request motorists to remove the cars from the pavements whenever such parking comes to our notice. This problem would not get solved in a day but we are continuously working on it to see that it stops,” said a NKDA official. NKDA is trying on to shift all existing road side stalls which have been doing business by occupying the footpaths to the 900 rehabilitation stalls which NKDA have setup. A two storied rehabilitation market is also on the cards where existing hawkers are being planned to be rehabilitated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/suman-cars-parked-on-footpath-in-new-town-31-08-21/articleshow/85814487.cms||Suman Chakraborti

---||Bareilly||Engineer grad, 32, on suicide watch, goes missing after visit to thana, kin slam police||Bareilly: She arrived at the thana a little past midnight, barefoot, disheveled and edgy. Shaking a cop out of slumber, the woman, 32, told him she wanted to go to Delhi to see her brother. The drowsy policeman reached into his pocket, took out a crumpled Rs 10 note and handed it over to her. “Take a rickshaw to the railway station and board a train to Delhi,” the cop commanded, and went back to sleep. No one saw the woman after that-- who was suffering from psychological disorder since the death of her brother in 2019. Arrival of Raksha Bandhan had aggravated her condition and her parents had locked her. But she had slipped out on Thursday night. Four days on, the family members of Jasmeet Kaur -- a bright student who had topped her B.Tech class -- have searched for her everywhere in Shahjahanpur, and in Delhi at the homes of relatives, both close and distant. Police have now formed teams in a bid to trace Jasmeet, who is nowhere to be found. Shahjahanpur’s senior superintendent of police (SSP) S Anand told TOI, “The woman had indeed come to the police station on that night with a complaint against her parents. A clerical officer had asked her to return home. He had also told the woman that a policeman will be sent to her house to probe her accusations. He should have shown more sensitivity. But the allegation of advising her to go to the railway station doesn’t seem to be correct. At this moment, our priority is to ensure that the girl is recovered safely. Multiple teams have been deployed on this operation.” Her father, Satbeer Singh, runs a sports equipment shop in Shahjahanpur city. His youngest son, Jashn Singh, had killed himself by jumping before a train. Jasmeet was shaken by Jashn’s death as they shared a very close bond. She couldn’t recover from the trauma. Satbeer told TOI, “My daughter was a topper from Punjab Technical University (PTU), Jalandhar. The death of my youngest son had shaken her. She was getting treatment for her psychological problems, and was showing improvement too. But her condition worsened after Raksha Bandhan. She was hallucinating, speaking to her dead brother. She claimed that he was calling her to meet and tie rakhi. We were keeping her locked during the night. “On the intervening night of Thursday and Friday, she jumped from the terrace and fled. She straightway went to Sadar Bazar police station and gave a complaint to an officer on duty alleging that we were not allowing her to go to Delhi. Instead of informing us or to seniors, the policeman on duty gave her Rs 10 and asked her to go to the railway station and get a train for Delhi.” Satbeer further said, “The complaint was also found on the desk of a policeman who does clerical work. Now my daughter is not traceable. She is not even carrying a mobile phone. I am afraid that the insensitivity shown by police may cost my daughter’s life. Even now, the police are not taking my complaint seriously. All of my family members are searching for her.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/engineer-grad-32-on-suicide-watch-goes-missing-after-visit-to-thana-kin-slam-police/articleshow/85808736.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

The accused was arrested by the Salem town police in Karur district on Tuesday morning. Police inspector Sampangi said the accused, Yesudas, 53, and his wife Revathi, 47, were married for 20 years and have three children. Yesudas was a disinfectant sprayer with the Salem municipal corporation, while the victim was a housewife “Three months ago, Revathi separated from Yesudas as he was harassing her suspecting her of infidelity. Yesudas went to his mother-in-law house at Vaiyappamalai in Namakkal district a few days ago and managed to persuade his wife to come back and live with him. She returned with him to his house on Saturday. However, he thrashed her on Sunday night, again suspecting her of infidelity,” the inspector said. Next morning, Revathi lodged a complaint against her husband with the Salem town police station. During an inquiry, Revathi told the police that she wanted to divorce her husband and police officers also advised her to approach a family court to do the same. Subsequently, Revathi, accompanied by her mother, went to the old bus stand to board a bus to Rasipuram. “Yesudas who came there, suddenly, threw acid on her and ran away,” the inspector said. Revathi sustained severe burn injuries and her mother also suffered minor injuries, the inspector said. Revathi was taken to the hospital and was getting treated there. However, she succumbed to her injuries around 11.30pm on Monday, the inspector added. The police altered the case from murder attempt to murder (Section 302 of the Indian penal code) and launched a search for Yesudas. When they got a tip-off that the accused was hiding at his relative’s house in Karur, a team went there and arrested him on Tuesday morning. The accused was later lodged at the central prison under judicial custody for 15 days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/salem/47-year-old-salem-woman-dies-in-acid-attack-husband-53-arrested/articleshow/85816862.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Metropolitan Magistrate Rajat Goyal sought response of the concerned station house officer (SHO) as to whether any complaint has been made by the complainant, any action has been taken on it, any investigation or inquiry has been conducted in this regard and its status and if any cognisable offence was made out, whether any FIR has been registered or not. The complaint, filed by a law teacher Faisal Ahmed Khan, alleged that Amu made “provocative and divisive” remarks on May 30 and July 4 at two separate mahapanchayats organised in Haryana, with the intention of outraging the religious feelings of the Muslim community, to disturb public peace and tranquillity, and to cause fear and alarm among persons belonging to the community. The complaint filed against Narsinghanand alleged that in July, he in an interview in Uttar Pradesh made communally provocative statements with an intent to cause riots and incite persons belonging to the Hindu community to commit criminal offences against Muslims. “He deliberately and maliciously insulted Aligarh Muslim University,” it further claimed. The complaints, filed through advocate Sarim Naved, further claimed that the complainant moved court as the concerned SHO refused to receive the copy of the complaints against Amu and Narsinghanand.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/fir-plea-against-karni-sena-chief-priest-court-seeks-report-from-police/articleshow/85816881.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Dahanu recorded 223mm of rainfall and Palghar 135mm in the 24 hours ending 8.30am on Tuesday. The IMD had placed Palghar under a red alert for Tuesday. The city was placed under a yellow alert for Wednesday as well. From Thursday, rain activity is expected to subside, according to the IMD forecast. Shubhangi Bhute, scientist, IMD Mumbai, said rain was recorded across the Konkan, Vidarbha and Marathwada because of a cyclonic circulation which lies over Vidarbha and its neighbourhood, besides the east-west shear zone. “Mumbai, Thane, Palghar and Raigad could see heavy rain spells,” she said. The showers cooled down the city considerably, with both observatories recording a maximum temperature of 26 degrees Celsius, a relief from the hot days seen last week. This monsoon so far, the IMD Santacruz observatory has recorded a total of 2,421.8mm of rainfall. June saw 961.4mm, which was above its normal of 505mm, while July recorded 1,122mm, which was also above its normal of 827.5. The 338.4mm rainfall in August was below its normal of 546.2mm. Water stocks in lakes that meet the needs of the city stood at 1.28 lakh crore litres, or 88.69% of capacity. Last year on the same date, the total water stock in the these reservoirs was at 96% of capacity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/rain-cools-mumbai-city-this-aug-gets-tag-of-decades-fourth-driest/articleshow/85818699.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Mangaluru||No guidelines for daily commuters: Chaos likely at border today||Mangaluru: Chaos is likely to prevail in Talapady, at the Kerala-Karnataka border on Wednesday, with the Dakshina Kannada (DK) administration making seven days of quarantine mandatory for all students, employees and others from Kerala entering the district on Tuesday. This follows the state government failing to issue separate entry guidelines for daily commuters, tourists and businessmen, whose stay would be for less than 24-48 hours in the DK district or Karnataka. An earlier order mandated that daily commuters undergo the RT-PCR test once in seven days. This too has gone out of the window with the new order. The new order by deputy commissioner KV Rajendra on Tuesday, states that all students from Kerala should bring RT-PCR negative report not older than 72 hours, to enter DK. “They should undergo seven days of mandatory quarantine after entering, and should get themselves tested again after seven days. This guideline will be applicable for all others from Kerala, who visit Dakshina Kannada for work or any other purposes. All employers in the district should ensure their employees from Kerala possess valid RT-PCR negative reports. It is the responsibility of institutions and employers to enforce the quarantine,” he said. Since there were no separate guidelines for daily commuters, the DC said, “It is implied that all those who visit the district for business, functions, pilgrimage and other purposes with RT-PCR negative report, will also have to undergo quarantine here.” SOPs for daily commuters soon: Minister Health minister K Sudhakar said on Tuesday at Chikkaballapur, that the government will issue guidelines pertaining to the movement of daily commuters, who are entering the border districts of Karnataka every day. “Many daily commuters from Kerala are visiting Dakshina Kannada, Udupi and Chamarajanagar districts every day, for education, health services and jobs. I will discuss how separate guidelines can be enforced for them with chief minister Basavaraj Bommai,” he said. Night curfew, weekend curfew Night curfew will continue in Dakshina Kannada between 9pm and 5am. However, emergency vehicles with patients and their bystanders will be allowed to move, and all medical establishments can stay open. Similarly, all industries that require night shifts can continue to function, and all types of goods vehicles will be allowed to ply, he said. Similarly, weekend curfew will be in force from 9pm on Friday to 5am on Monday. However, emergency services will not be affected. In addition, industries, companies and organisations that need to function 24x7 will be allowed to function. Shops selling food, groceries, fruits, vegetables, meat and fodder will be allowed to open between 5am and 2pm, during the curfew imposed on weekends. Liquor outlets and restaurants will be allowed to continue takeaway services, he said, adding that those who are travelling by bus, train and flights will be allowed to travel in vehicles, but need to show their tickets to the authorities during night curfew and weekend curfew. Tushar Giri Nath, principal secretary to revenue department, had issued an order on August 30 directing districts bordering Kerala and Maharashtra to enforce strict surveillance at the border posts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/no-guidelines-for-daily-commuters-chaos-likely-at-border-today/articleshow/85811909.cms||---
---||India||Amit Shah unveils portal, says Jammu and Kashmir could see Rs 50,000 crore investment||NEW DELHI: Home minister Amit Shah said on Tuesday that Rs 50,000 crore worth of investments could flow into J&K ushering in all-inclusive and all round development of the Union Territory as he launched a web portal for registration of units under the ‘Central Sector Scheme for Industrial Development of Jammu and Kashmir.’ “A new dawn of investment and industrial development will begin in J&K with the launch of this portal. Today, the most attractive industrial policy in the country is here (in J&K),” he said while addressing the event via video-conferencing. Shah added that the policy will boost investment in sectors like tourism, education and IT by offering incentives, create jobs for the locals and give a fillip to ancillary industries in a conducive “industrial eco-system”. Joining in the event were J&K LG Manoj Sinha; commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal; minister of state for PMO Jitendra Singh; MoS (home) Nityanand Rai; junior ministers for commerce & industry Som Prakash and Anupriya Patel; senior officials of the central and J&K governments; and industry representatives. Speaking on the occasion, Piyush Goyal said the beginning of online portal & roll out of central sector schemes would further improve ease of doing business and bring all-round transparency. The portal will make the entire process under the scheme i.e. applying for registration, submitting claims and their processing within the department, online and without any human interface. Shah said that industries were shy of investing in J&K all these years due to some hurdle or the other, and the scrapping of Article 70 and Article 35A had removed these hurdles. He said the new central sector scheme for J&K was a huge milestone in fulfilling the promise made by the Prime Minister to the people of Jammu and Kashmir in August 2019. “Prime Minister had announced a package of Rs. 80,068 crore in Srinagar on November 7, 2015. (After nullification of Article 370 and 35A), one-nation-one-ration card scheme, Ujjwala, DBT, Saubhagya and many other schemes have been implemented in J&K,” Shah noted. He added that all households in J&K would have clean water supply by August 15, 2022 and J&K was the only state where everyone was covered under the Pradhan Mantri Ayushman Bharat Yojana. On the security front, Shah said there were record tourist arrivals in J&K this year and three-tier panchayat system polls were held without a single bullet being fired. “To those who say that what is the difference (after nullification of Article 370), I want to say that in 70 years, previous governments could not provide even basic facilities such as housing, toilets, electricity and water to about 2,20,000 families of the state, but Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi provided all these…in 2 to 3 years,” he underlined. Total financial outlay of the central sector scheme for J&K is Rs 28,400 crore and it envisages four types of incentives, namely, capital investment incentive, capital interest subvention; GST-linked incentive; and working capital interest subvention. It is expected to generate 78,000 direct employment opportunities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/amit-shah-unveils-portal-says-jammu-and-kashmir-could-see-rs-50000-crore-investment/articleshow/85820116.cms||---

The victim in this case stated she is living with the accused on her own will and she is seven months pregnant. The defence counsel pleaded in the court that it was not correct that the accused had been arrested on the information provided by any informer, and the claim of the police was false. The accused had neither enticed/kidnapped the girl nor raped her. Moreover, there was no independent witness to corroborate the police charges, the defence counsel argued. The accused has been in jail since July 25, 2021. As this is the first bail application moved by the accused and that no other bail application is pending in any court, therefore, he should be released on bail, the defence counsel submitted. Countering the defence counsel's arguments, ADGC Sushil Kumar Verma said the accused had been nabbed by the police. He had enticed and eloped with the victim who was a minor with an intention to establish physical relations with her, therefore, his bail application was rejected. The court in its order observed that after perusing the record and evidence on file and on the basis of the victim’s statement recorded under section 164 Cr P C there was no ground to grant bail to the accused hence his bail application was being rejected.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/minors-abduction-rape-court-rejects-bail-plea-of-accused/articleshow/85818717.cms||Anant Shekher Misra
---||Delhi||Delhi HC to hear plea on police chief appointment today||NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court will examine on Wednesday a petition challenging the appointment of Gujarat-cadre IPS officer Rakesh Asthana as Delhi Police commissioner, along with an intervention by an NGO. On August 25, the Supreme Court had asked the high court to decide within two weeks the plea pending before it against the appointment of the senior IPS officer as city’s top cop. The apex court had then also permitted NGO, ‘Centre for Public Interest Litigation’ (CPIL), which has challenged the appointment before the apex court, to move the high court to intervene in the pending plea by one Sadre Alam. Appearing for the NGO before a bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and justice Jyoti Singh, advocate Prashant Bhushan alleged that Alam’s plea was a “copy-paste” of CPIL’s plea before the Supreme Court. In the intervention application, the NGO has contended that filing an identical writ petition without mentioning the pendency of the issue before the apex court seems to have been filed to “defeat public interest by scuttling the genuine, bona fide and well-researched and deliberated PIL (pending before the Supreme Court).” Alam stated that his petition was an outcome of his hard work. In his petition before the high court, Alam has sought quashing of the July 27 order, issued by the ministry of home affairs appointing Asthana as Delhi Police commissioner and also the order granting inter-cadre deputation and extension of service to him. It claimed the high-powered committee, comprising the Chief Justice of India, the Prime Minister and the leader of Opposition, in its meeting held on May 24, 2021, rejected the Central’s attempt to appoint Asthana as the CBI director on the basis of the “six-month rule” as laid down by the Supreme Court in Prakash Singh case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-to-hear-plea-on-police-chief-appointment-today/articleshow/85816964.cms||---

In both cases, the accused have been booked for disobedience to the order duly promulgated by government authority and unlawfully or negligently committing an act which is likely to spread the infection of any disease dangerous to life. City Chowk police registered an offence against the Sena leader late on Monday after he led the Kavad Yatra along with his supporters on Sunday. The complaint lodged by police sub-inspector Bhagwan Mujgule states the MLC along with 10 identified and five unidentified people not only organized the Kavad Yatra, but also entered Khadkeshwar Mahadev temple from the back entrance for performing pooja. Police decided to become the complainant in the case, after no one, including the temple priest, came forward to lodge the complaint. In the second offence, registered with Jawahar Nagar police station, Aurangabad East’s BJP MLA along with 20 others have been booked after they had gathered for a protest, demanding opening of temples. Authorities maintained that due to the pandemic and fears of Covid-19 third wave looming large, restrictions continue to remain in place for all kinds of political, religious and social gatherings. “There has been a conditional exemption for religious as well as social gatherings like marriages, but both the gatherings in which offences have been registered were clearly in violation of the existing Covid-19 norms,” a senior police officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/sena-mlc-bjp-mla-booked-for-violating-covid-norms/articleshow/85816918.cms||Mohammed Akhef

The village panchayats were selected based on the annual income generated, geographical proximity and urbanisation parameters. Presidents of these village panchayats have been asked to convene an emergency meeting to discuss the proposal with their respective ward members and pass a resolution on the same. The 25 village panchayats have a population ranging between 1,447 and 17,257. The villages were identified from Andanallur, Manikandam, Manachanallur, Thiruverumbur and Lalgudi blocks, thus paving the way for an expansion on all sides of the existing city boundaries. A total of eight villages were identified from Manikandam block including Thayanur and Nagamangalam, followed by five each in Lalgudi and Thiruverumbur covering Esanakorai, Thalakudi, Appadurai and Gundoor. The merger has received mixed response with a section welcoming it to avail of better amenities while another, mostly those relying on agriculture, opposing it since MGNREGA scheme will be scrapped. “The district administration has assured us on development activities but our village has plenty of livestock. People are afraid of stringent animal control laws after the merger,” Josephine Jayaraj, president of Kizhakurichi panchayat in Thiruverumbur block, adds. Gundoor panchayat residents hope the merger will get rid of their drinking water woes. “Higher taxes are a concern, we will discuss with the nine ward members and take a decision,” U Vigneshwaran, president of Malliampathu panchayat, selected from Andanallur block, said. “The selection is not final, panchayats with over 75% agriculture land may not be merged,” an official said. But most villages identified, have seen rapid urbanisation, resulting in the composition of agricultural land falling below 75% of the total area. In the next few days, the panchayat presidents are expected to pass resolutions either in favour or against the merger, following which the district administration will make further moves.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/25-village-panchayats-identified-for-merger-with-trichy-city-corpn/articleshow/85814656.cms||Deepak Karthik
---||Mangaluru||Active cases, TPR dip in DK, but spike in Kasaragod a concern||Mangaluru: Though the decline in active Covid-19 cases and test positivity rate has raised hope in people of Dakshina Kannada (DK), the spike in Kerala, especially in Kasaragod, is a cause for concern. While the daily average cases in DK were above 300 in the first week of August, in the last week, only 229 cases were recorded per day. The active caseload in DK has also reduced drastically from 3,682 on August 14 to 2,352 on Monday. The average test positivity rate, which was 4%-5% in the first week of August, has reduced to below 2% in the past three days. However, the district administration is being cautious, as the active caseload in Kasaragod district is more than double that of DK. For example, while DK reported 1,609 cases in the last one week from August 24, Kasaragod recorded 3,724 cases. Kasaragod has nearly 4,900 active cases, while DK has below 2,400 cases. The state government has already issued fresh guidelines on Monday, making seven days institutional quarantine mandatory for students and employees from Kerala, after entering Dakshina Kannada with RT-PCR negative reports. The Karnataka government’s order has literally put thousands of daily commuters from Kasaragod, especially those working in educational institutions, industries and in many other establishments in Mangaluru and surrounding areas, in trouble. Sahayathri, a group of people from Kasaragod district working in DK, have been demanding that they be given entry passes to commute daily. “We have been urging the DK administration to issue passes based on the RT-PCR test reports, once in 15 days, for all employees from Kasaragod, who visit DK daily for work,” a member of Sahayathri urged. Deputy commissioner K V Rajendra told TOI that the district administration has been following the order issued by the state government. “The order has directions to all districts on the Kerala and Maharashtra border, to increase surveillance. There will be strict surveillance at border posts. It is difficult to manage daily commuters from Kerala in the present situation,” he said.

The decision was taken to prevent the spread of the pandemic or reduce the complications of Covid-19 among residents. According to councillors, at least 90% of those above the age of 18 have already got the first dose of the jab. “Now, all the eligible persons who are yet to get the first dose of vaccine should contact the councillor in their area. The councillors should prepare a list of those who are yet to get the first dose of the vaccine in their divisions,” mayor M Anil Kumar said. “The focus should be on providing the first dose of the vaccine for people in the next few days. The councillors should take special care in this regard,” Anil Kumar said. Most of the councillors have expressed satisfaction over the manner in which vaccination is progressing their areas. “I think it is the precautions we took prior to Onam celebrations that minimized the spread of the pandemic. We had conducted meetings with merchants, police, health department officials and other stakeholders before the onset of Onam season. We organized special vaccination drives for various sections like headload workers, shopowners, workers, etc,” Anil Kumar said. Councillor M G Aristotle has asked the mayor to be vigilant against the third wave of the pandemic. “PVS Hospital had been one of the major Covid treatment facilities in the city. Now, it is not a Covid treatment centre. So, we should look for alternatives,” Aristotle said. “We should look for other options like converting auditoriums or such facilities in Kaloor into Covid treatment centre. There are reports that the third wave would be affecting children the most. So, there should be adequate facilities,” he said. Opposition leader Antony Kureethra said that there should be urgent steps to arrange ambulances in the city. “The government had issued guidelines stating that facilities for transporting Covid patients to the treatment facilities should be arranged by the local bodies. Still, the corporation doesn’t operate ambulances in the city,” Kureethra said. Many of the councillors said that a section of officials with the corporation are receiving kickbacks. “On the one hand, they cause hardships for genuine applicants and merchants for providing various services and on the other, they help big sharks,” C A Shakkir, an LDF councillor said. Mayor has asked the additional secretary to conduct a probe into the alleged cases of bribery among officials with the Edappally zonal office of the corporation. He has warned that officials with tainted records would not be allowed to continue to work with the corporation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/corp-sets-5-day-deadline-to-complete-1st-dose-vax-for-18/articleshow/85814672.cms||---

This is the second robbery on the Bopal-Shela stretch in just a month. Manoj Agrawal, 43, a resident of Arcus Sky Bungalows in Shela, in his FIR with Bopal police stated that he works as a CA for a realty developer in Prahladnagar. At around 3am on Monday, when Agrawal and his wife, Vandana, were asleep in their bedroom on the first floor of their house, they heard a noise and woke up. As they woke up, they found four men, between 30 and 35 years old, in front of them. The men shone a torch on the couple’s faces and threatened to kill them if they spoke. The four men had knives which they pointed at the couple. They forcibly removed Agrawal’s 7-gram gold bracelet, and then Vandana’s 15-gram mangalsutra, and gold bangles, weighing around 50g. The four men told Agrawal to open their sons’ room, but he pleaded saying his kids were unwell and they should not wake them up. Meanwhile, Manoj’s older son woke up and locked his room from the inside. The robbers then went downstairs for a while and left the house after some time. Manoj’s son called a relative, who informed police of the robbery. After the robbers left, Manoj went downstairs and found the house ransacked. He discovered that the had also taken his laptop, worth about Rs 30,000. Bopal police filed a complaint of robbery and abetment against the four men. On July 31, four accused persons entered a house in Ghuma and made off with valuables worth Rs 2 lakh after confining the victims to the house. The case is still unsolved.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/shela-couple-robbed-at-knifepoint/articleshow/85814671.cms||---
---||Meerut||62-yr-old convict released early stuck in jail as kin refuse to take him in||Bijnor: A 62-year-old murder convict lodged in Bareilly jail whose “good behaviour” prompted authorities to grant him early release last month is stuck in prison since nobody in his family is willing to take him in and furnish a “guarantee” — an essential part of the release protocol for a prisoner serving life sentence. According to Sanjay Kumar, Bijnor district probation officer, a guarantee is a signed affidavit given by kin which acknowledges handover of the inmate and vouches to inform the probation officer in case of any wrongdoing. “The inmate, Keshav Sharan, has served 15 years in prison. Orders to release him were given last month. He is unmarried and has two brothers in Bijnor but both have refused to take him in, arguing that his release will have a bad influence on their children and the society,” the officer told TOI. The probation officer, who acts as the state-appointed guardian of an inmate in such cases, is now tasked with his rehabilitation and is looking for distant family members willing to provide shelter to the man. Sharan was convicted in 2006 of murdering the husband of a woman he had a relationship with. A local court in Bijnor sentenced him to life imprisonment. He was later shifted from Bijnor jail to Bareilly jail. Sharan was supposed to walk free on August 15 after a state-level committee approved his release in July. “Every year, on August 15 and October 2, prisoners above the age of 60 years are released on the basis of good conduct. Jail administration sends a report to a state-level panel which takes the final call. Two inmates from Bareilly jail were chosen for release, including Sharan,” said the probation officer. Once the inmate is released, the probation officer visits them from time to time. Such a person is not allowed to leave the district without informing the authorities. They are encouraged to find employment under MGNREGA Act and avail of other government facilities such as Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana for easier reintegration into society.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/62-yr-old-convict-released-early-stuck-in-jail-as-kin-refuse-to-take-him-in/articleshow/85808824.cms||Harveer Dabas

The resolutions comprising information about project cost, detailed infrastructure proposals and key decisions made such as revising the user fee and appointment of the workforce, are official documents to track the activities of the civic body. TOI on August 19 had carried a report highlighting the lack of transparency in an article titled ‘Activists slam Trichy corporation for not sharing resolutions passed sans council’. Subsequently, the corporation published the four resolutions passed in July and August 2021. “The civic body has not shared the resolutions passed between April 2018 and June 2021. They should be published too,” S P Thiyagarajan, an RTI activist said. The activist said that the corporation should disclose the resolutions from the past three years as several smart cities mission projects involving hundreds of crores investment were implemented.

The owner of the duplex could not be traced, and has not claimed the excess amount within six months, so the civic body can retain the entire amount. Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B has directed NMC property tax department to expedite process of auctioning open plots and structures for recovery of arrears. NMC deputy commissioner Milind Meshram told TOI, “This duplex happens to be the first structure to be auctioned for recovery of property tax arrears, where possession was taken by successful bidder, in 70 years of NMC history.” The annual tax of the duplex at HB Estate in Sonegaon was Rs4,445 and tax had been pending since 2000. NMC gave many notices but none responded, as no one was residing in the duplex. Even the housing society had no idea about the whereabouts of the owner. “We completed due process and auctioned it. A resident of the same area participated and emerged as successful bidder in the auction. We handed over sale certificate and related documents to him some days ago,” the NMC chief said. The civic body had kept the house’s as offset value at Rs38.35 lakh for constructed area 52.74 sq m, on 122.12 sq m plot. Meshram added, “There is a provision in the Maharashtra Municipal Corporations (MMC) Act that the owner can claim excess amount of the auction within six months. In this case, owner did not claim within stipulated time period. Now, NMC cannot give excess amount to the owner. After paying tax arrears, remaining Rs54.43 lakh became NMC’s money.” Before this case, a couple of structures had been auctioned but possession was not given to successful bidders as the owner turned up and paid the arrears. The owners can claim the property within 20 days of auction by paying entire arrears to NMC, and 5% of auctioned value to successful bidder. Meshram also said a proposal will be tabled before the general body to release excess amount recovered to owner even after six months. “An open plot at Manewada was auctioned for recovery of arrears of Rs1.72 lakh. NMC got Rs28.5 lakh in auction. Owner requested excess amount after six months. Since NMC has got its arrears, on humanitarian grounds, the owner should get the remaining amount. Therefore, we are proposing a policy decision,” he said. Meshram said many open plots and structures were shortlisted for auction. “Any property with arrears of over Rs50,000 will be auctioned,” he said. Total arrears of property tax stand at around Rs680 crore. NMC had initiated auction of 9,745 properties for recovery of arrears. Of these, 2,595 properties have been seized till date. Auction process of 495 properties has been completed. Sale certificate followed by handing over possession of properties to successful bidder has been done in 13 cases, of which 12 were open plots and one duplex at Sonegaon. The civic body could not get bidders in the auction of 138 properties, so they were registered in NMC’s name.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-auctions-duplex-to-recover-rs2-57l-property-tax-earns-rs57l/articleshow/85817018.cms||Anjaya Anparthi
---||Delhi||Delhi govt in talks with Centre to ease restrictions on induction of e-buses||NEW DELHI: Delhi government is in talks with the Centre to ease restrictions on the number of electric buses that can be inducted under the FAME (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles) scheme so that up to 5,000 electric buses can be added in Delhi’s in the city’s public transport fleet in the next five years. Jasmine Shah, vice-chairperson of the Delhi Dialogue and Development Commission said that the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) has already floated a tender for 300 e-buses and as a large part of its fleet is going to retire in the next couple of years, there is an opportunity to scale up the number of e-buses. Shah was speaking at a webinar organised by the Centre for Science and Environment to discuss ways to build scale and speed up zero-emission mobility. “This is where the alignment with FAME needs to be improved. The upfront subsidy that FAME gives drives down the cost per km and a state like Delhi can easily absorb three or five thousand e-buses in the next five years,” Shah said. He said that there are restrictions on how many e-buses can be subsidised under FAME, but that doesn’t work for a city of the scale of Delhi, Mumbai or Bengaluru. He said Delhi has the know-how, backend support and infrastructure and everything is all set but for this small hitch. Sunita Narain, director-general of CSE said that if there is no transformation of scale in the adoption of electric mobility, the benefits will not add up. Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, CSE said that a ‘zero-emission mandate’ is required in the country, along with other accelerators like charging and battery ecosystem, fuel economy regulations, financing strategies, etc. Roychowdhury said incentives provided by Delhi government can also reduce the on-road price of electric two-wheelers by 57% on average. Shah added that Delhi’s EV policy gives generous incentives and the two-wheelers and three-wheelers are going to be the game changers when it comes to scale and volume. “Delhi government is giving the remaining permits for autorickshaws only to e-autos and there would be more than 4,000 e-autos in the city soon,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-govt-in-talks-with-centre-to-ease-restrictions-on-induction-of-e-buses/articleshow/85817024.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Aurangabad||Activists call for RTE Act reforms as BEO’s son gets spot in top school||Aurangabad: The son of a Block Education Officer (BEO) getting admission under RTE Act, 2009, in one of the top CBSE schools in Aurangabad has sparked sharp reactions from the educational activists. Stressing on the need for introducing reforms in the admission process, activists have highlighted that such a measure will ensure only genuine beneficiaries get admitted under the RTE Act. “There is a need for putting income limit on parents from the reserved category who seek admissions for their wards under the RTE Act. Like many other admissions, beneficiaries from the creamy layer should be barred from getting admissions,” educational activist Prashant Sathe said. Sathe also stressed on the need for spot-verification to ensure validity of address proof submitted by the beneficiaries. “In a new modus operandi to secure admission, it has been found that a section of parents update their address on Aadhaar falling under the concept of ‘neighbourhood school’. Besides, use of bogus leave and license agreement continues to go unchecked in many cases,” he said. In a latest case, the BEO, whose wife is also working as a teacher, is found to have secured admission in one of the leading school for academic year 2021-22. As per records, the official lives in CIDCO N-2 area which is located around 10 kilometer from the school concerned. When contacted, education officer with Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) Ramnath Thore said demand for reforms needed in RTE admission process would be conveyed to the state government. In regard to admission case involving the BEO, Thore said affluent parents from the reserved category should not take part in RTE admission process on moral grounds. “In case of alleged discrepancy related to address proof, we will carry out the spot admission,” he said. Aurangabad district has witnessed 2,486 confirmed admissions under the RTE Act across 603 schools by Tuesday against a collective intake capacity of 3,625 seats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/activists-call-for-rte-act-reforms-as-beos-son-gets-spot-in-top-school/articleshow/85817023.cms||---

He was here to attend a programme organized by the ‘Khangar’ community. Announcing the roadmap of his alliance in front of reporters, Rajbhar said, “There will be one CM for each year for five years from marginalized castes. Similarly, the 20 Dy CMs will be from castes representing various weaker sections of the society.” “When there are two DyCMs in the state despite a complete majority government, five in Andhra Pradesh and two in Bihar, why not represent all the marginalized castes that have been looked down so far,” Rajbhar added. Rajbhar said, “We have made alliances with all the parties that represent small and marginalized people, whose interests have been suppressed so far. Hence, it is now their turn to form the government.” Pronouncing the common agenda of the alliance, he said, “There will be free electricity for domestic consumption for the entire five years if we come to power. In addition, there will be free and common education for all along with free medical treatment. Also, we will ensure a caste-based census in the state and give 33% representation to women.” Attacking the BJP, he said that “it is a sinking ship which had earlier won just because of me and Anupriya Patel”. “BJP is a lying machine which only lies and does nothing. It is a washing machine in which a criminal is put in and he comes out with a clean image. That is why they are inducting so many leaders with a tainted image and trying to give them a clean image.” The Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha is a political alliance formed for 2022 Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections. The coalition is led by the SBSP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/will-have-5-cms-20-dycms-if-we-come-to-power-in-2022-rajbhar/articleshow/85818758.cms||Arindam Ghosh

A bench led by Justice Prasanna Varale heard a petition by Sabina Lakdawala for police protection and to quash an FIR filed by Lakdawala’s daughter-in-law. Sabina’s advocate Matthews Nedumpara said she “apprehends some mischief” from Lakdawala’s children who may cause physical injury to her. Prosecutor Geeta Mulekar said no application was submitted to the competent authority – the additional CP and DCP, responsible for providing protection. The judges then directed the competent authority to consider her application and pass orders no later than September 17. The bench had earlier suggested that both sides explore mediation. “Since the parties are not in a position to settle the matter amicably as such the petition shall be heard by us on its own merits,” it added.tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-police-to-decide-on-security-for-for-bldrs-wife/articleshow/85818763.cms||---

But she did not turn up. Around 40 police personnel were deployed at the local body office to prevent any hostile incidents, while women’s wing of the CPM and Kerala Congress and BJP workers protested outside. Earlier following the seizure of CCTV footage during a vigilance raid, the municipality secretary had sealed the cabin of the chairperson. The secretary pasted the notice on the door of the cabin preventing anybody from entering the room where the monitor, CPU and hard disc of the CCTVs in the municipal office are kept. The notice was issued under section 228 of the Kerala Municipality Act which says the secretary shall exercise supervision and control of the work of all officers and staff. However, the chairperson had claimed that the notice does not prevent her from entering her cabin. The footage allegedly contains visuals of councillors leaving the chamber carrying money. Opposition LDF had earlier approached the vigilance complaining that there are chances for destroying the visuals by the ruling UDF. Meanwhile, vigilance officials said they have submitted a preliminary inquiry report to the director on Tuesday to take a final call based on the findings. Though sources refused to divulge the findings in the report, officials said they are waiting for the order of the director ‘to proceed further in the case’, indicating there are facts in allegations raised by the opposition against the chairperson. While Ernakulam DCC gave a clean chit to the chairperson maintaining that the current allegations are politically motivated due to the internal conflicts in the party. The two-member team constituted to probe into the allegations is yet to submit the report to senior leaders. “We are still collecting the statement of Congress councillors. The report will be submitted to T J Vinod MLA, before the new DCC president takes charge,” said a source. However, sources say the statement collection was completed last week itself. While V D Suresh, the congress councillor who approached the vigilance along with opposition councillors complaining the chairperson gifted Rs 10,000 as Onam gift, said the enquiry team has not approached him yet to record his statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/onam-gift-row-plot-thickens-as-police-oppn-all-set-to-prevent-chairperson/articleshow/85814736.cms||---
---||Patna||Bihar CM Nitish Kumar rubbishes ‘PM material’ talk by JD(U) leaders||PATNA: Bihar CM Nitish Kumar on Tuesday rubbished the talk by his party leaders that he is “PM material”. Nitish was referring to the JD(U)’s national council meeting held in Patna on July 29, in which the party’s newly nominated national president Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan had said that “no people or political party should have problem if any political worker says that CM Nitish Kumar has all qualities of becoming the prime minister and our CM is a ‘PM material”. “Its all rubbish. Please do not discuss these things. When a party meeting takes place, the participants speak whatever comes to their minds. Was our party meeting convened for this purpose? ….The party meeting was convened for other works... for ratifying the election of the JD(U) president, mandatory approval to the recent amendment in the party’s constitution and to discuss the issue of caste-based census,” Nitish said while talking to mediapersons at the Patna airport after his return from Darbhanga where he had gone to review the flood situation. Without taking the name of any JD(U) leader, Nitish said, “If anyone speaks ‘something’ in the party meeting, it does not mean that it was the party’s formal decision. Please excuse me on this matter (PM material),” Nitish requested the mediapersons with folded hands. Lalan had also said, “Our leader Nitish Kumar has all qualities of becoming a prime minister, but he is not a candidate for the post. There is a difference between ‘having all qualities of PM’ and ‘being a candidate for the post of PM’. Right now, our CM is not a candidate for the post of PM.” When asked whether he got any response from PM Narendra Modi on the demand for a caste-based census across the country, Nitish said, “No, we have so far not received any response (from the PM office) over the matter. We (the delegation) put all our arguments before the PM during our meeting. …. The decision has to be taken by him.” On being asked how long he would wait for a response from the PM, Nitish said, “We have been waiting till date. But the census (2021) work has not been started yet. If the census work begins, our suggestion is that it should be carried out on caste-basis. You better know, now people in all states have been demanding caste-wise census.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/nitish-rubbishes-pm-material-talk-by-jdu-leaders/articleshow/85815134.cms||Madan Kumar

The deceased were identified as Sunilkumar (40) of Kodavanthuruth in Maradu and Babu (40), a native of Chellanam. The injured persons, Milton and Joseph, who were initially admitted to Alappuzha Medical College hospital, have been shifted to a private hospital in Kochi. The deceased and injured persons were travelling in the same car which collided head-on with another car heading in the opposite direction on the bypass road around 2am. Only the driver was in the other car, reportedly a large SUV, and he survived the accident with minor injuries. According to Alappuzha North police, the accident occurred on the bypass road near Bappu Vaidyar railway crossing. “Sunilkumar, who runs a business in interior design works, was returning to Ernakulam with three others when the accident occurred. There were only a few vehicles on the road at that time and both vehicles must have been speeding. Owing to the impact of the collision, Sunilkumar’s car has crushed completely,” said police. The fire and rescue along with the police had to cut the car open to take the passengers out. Though all of them were rushed to the hospital, Sunilkumar and Babu were declared brought dead. Their bodies were shifted to the mortuary and were later released to relatives.

Amit Patel, 43, a resident of the Meadows by Pacifica on Sanand-Sanathal highway, in his complaint with Satellite police said that he and a friend went to a food outlet at the south end of Iskcon Bridge in Satellite at around 1.30am on Tuesday. “I went to the food outlet, which provides egg dishes, and ordered an egg pulao and then waited in my car with my friend,” said Patel. As they did not provide the pulao for around 15 minutes, he went to enquire about his order. “I asked a person there why they did not serve me the egg pulao and did not do anything about my order, one of them told me that I had not given any order,” said Patel in the FIR. Patel said that he told the two waiters there that he had ordered the egg pulao and asked them why they were lying. This did not go down well with the two waiters, who allegedly began abusing Patel and one of them then pushed him to the ground. He said that one of the two waiters came there with a stick and hit Patel with it, causing him to bleed severely.

---||Delhi||Online snags: East Delhi residents get till September 15 to pay property tax||NEW DELHI: After many east Delhi residents failed to pay their property tax because of technical issues before August 31, the last date to get the rebate, East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) on Tuesday extended the deadline to September 15. While some taxpayers had failed to generate OTPs, others couldn’t get their Unique Property Identification Code (UPIC) number even after a month. A few were unable to upload information. However, officials claimed that problems had arisen as people were selecting the wrong ward numbers, categories for filing tax and making multiple attempts without waiting for some time, which was leading to a backlog in the system. “We have fixed almost all glitches. Now, only those people who are entering wrong information, ward number, etc are failing to register for the UPIC number. Taking note of the issues, we have extended the deadline till September 15 for getting the rebate and submitting a lump sum tax. However, those who want a new UPIC ID will need to apply online mandatorily by September 10. Thereafter, no rebate will be given,” said an EDMC official. Ravinder Singh Negi, a resident of Mayur Vihar Phase-I, said since July, he had made several attempts to generate the UPIC number, but failed each time. “It seems the online system has been developed just as a formality. Everything is so technical that a normal person will need guidance to file the tax. Even then there are chances of error,” he added. Satish Rastogi, a resident of Laxmi Nagar, had similar grievances. “I didn’t get an OTP on my mobile number, so couldn’t pay the tax by August 31,” he said. This time, filing tax online has been made compulsory. As a result, people, especially senior citizens, are finding it difficult to complete the exercise. The EDMC commissioner had called a meeting last Thursday to sort out the problems and issue guidelines. “I faced a problem in submitting tax because the online payment system was not functioning properly,” said Neha Banerji (name changed), a resident of Mayur Vihar-I. Vinod K Nair, RWA president of Pocket D, Mayur Vihar-III, said EDMC should make people aware of the procedure and share helpline numbers so they don’t make mistakes. A senior EDMC official said almost all cases regarding generation of UPIC numbers had been resolved. “As of now, only 4,000 cases are pending and will be sorted out in a day. Though we had uploaded 5 lakh UPIC numbers after a survey, issuing a fresh number takes at least 4-5 working days because the information has to be verified. EDMC issues 15-digit alphanumeric UPIC numbers,” added the official. “The problem arises when people whose UPIC numbers are already uploaded attempt to generate fresh ones without verifying it on the portal. This increases the load on the system. Many select the wrong item, ward number, etc in drop down boxes, which results in error. People might have also given wrong mobile numbers during the survey,” said the official. EDMC standing committee chairman Bir Singh Pawar agreed that there were complaints for difficulty in tax submission. “We are shifting the EDMC website to the NIC portal. In the process of making the system robust, we are facing some technical issues. This is why we have extended the deadline and asked residents to approach us for help,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/online-snags-east-delhi-residents-get-till-sept-15-to-pay-property-tax/articleshow/85817092.cms||Vibha Sharma

He had been lodged in the camp since August 2019 after he was arrested by Chennai city crime branch police for various offences including cheating and under sections of the foreigners Act. According to police, Ilian Zdravkov Markov, 54, a citizen of the Republic of Bulgaria, was found missing at the time of roll call on Tuesday morning. Subsequently, prison authorities alerted higher officials and also lodged a complaint with KK Nagar police. Officials suspect that he may have scaled the compound wall after coming out of the camp building through a window. Police said the grills of the window were found removed. Three special police teams have been formed to nab the man while investigation is on to find out out how he escaped. City police commissioner A Arun and other officials visited the camp and conducted inquiries. The accused had arrived in Chennai as a tourist on April 25, 2019, with a visa valid for two months. During his stay at a hotel, he had befriended another Bulgarian, Peter Petrov. Police arrested Peter in May 2019 on charges of cheating under various IPC sections and sections 66 and 43 of IT Act. Based on Peter’s statement, Chennai city crime branch police arrested Markov and lodged him in the central prison at Puzhal in May 2019. Thereafter he was shifted to the special camp at the central prison in Trichy in August 2019, sources said. Around 100 people including Bulgarians, Nigerians and Sri Lankans who had been arrested under the foreigners Act are lodged in the camp. The special camp is maintained by the district revenue authorities with security provided by Tamil Nadu special police battalion, Trichy. It may be recalled that a 31-year-old Nigerian national had escaped from the camp in July 2019. However, he was caught by the special police team in a few days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/bulgarian-national-escapes-from-special-camp-in-central-jail/articleshow/85814752.cms||---

Schools that have handwash centres at a distance from the entrance say portable handwash equipment could be provided to them through corporate social responsibility (CSR) programmes. City-based manufacturers claim that demand for foot-operated handwash kit is quite low compared to the period when schools reopened last year. Schools said the cost of stainless steel kits ranging about Rs 30,000 was prohibitive. “NGOs are placing orders for government schools in Chennai but Trichy-based schools have not placed any orders,” V Tamizhiniyan, founder of the startup Frigate, that manufactures foot-operated handwash kits, said. Certain schools that have handwash centres at the back of the campus claimed that such a portable unit if sponsored could ensure better safety for students. “Not all schools have handwashing infrastructure at the entrance,” Padma Shri M Subburaman, a social worker in Trichy, said. Education department sources said makeshift arrangements can be made near classrooms and school entrances. “A team of 135 officials including district education officers have examined the preparedness of all the 513 schools in the district that will open on Wednesday. Random checking will also be taken up once schools reopen,” a senior official with the department said, adding disinfection through local bodies was taken up in all the schools.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/rural-schools-seek-portable-handwash-kits/articleshow/85814734.cms||---

According to the data available with the state health department, Nashik, Ahmednagar, Dhule, Jalgaon and Nandurbar districts got a cumulative supply of 2.3 lakh doses in January when the vaccination of frontline health workers began. The vaccine supply to these five districts in August increased to more than 16 lakh doses. The total number of vaccine doses supplied to the five districts in the past seven months stands at about 65.7 lakh, the bulk of which was supplied to Nashik and Ahmednagar districts which have the largest number of beneficiaries. State health officials said that since January the supply has steadily improved in all these five districts. “The biggest increase in the supply took place in August — from over 9.8 lakh in July to over 16 lakh in August. In the preceding months the increase was in the range of about 1-2 lakh doses,” added the health officials. The officials said the frequency of the supply increased from twice a month in January and February to over 9 to 10 times a month now. Nashik’s vaccination coordinator and district deputy collector Ganesh Mishal, admitted that there has been significant improvement in the vaccine supply. “Since the availability of vaccines has vastly improved, the administration and civic body are able to vaccinate beneficiaries in greater numbers. Unlike earlier, the queues in front of the session sites have disappeared. We request the beneficiaries to get their shots without any delay,” said Misal. Echoing similar views, Dhule Covid-19 coordinator Dr Vishal Patil said the erratic supply is no longer an issue in the district. “Our pace of vaccination has increased since the vaccine is now available,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/8-fold-increase-in-covid-vaccine-supply-in-n-maha/articleshow/85817097.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

---||Ludhiana||You may face less traffic jams this festival season||Ludhiana: This year, the city residents may get some relief from traffic chaos during the festival season. Recently, a team of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), led by project director Krishan Sachdeva, along with joint commissioner of police Deepak Pareek, had visited different problem areas and come up with some changes and rectifications for smoother traffic flow. There has been chaos due to the Ludhiana-Ferozepur Road flyover project from Bharat Nagar Chowk to the old octroi post, which is about 10km long and covers major areas connecting to mini secretariat, Feroze Gandhi Market, Pakhowal Road, Gurdev Nagar, Sarabha Nagar, Ghumar Mandi, National Road, BRS Nagar, Punjab Agricultural University, Malhar Road, Maharaj Nagar, Southern Bypass, South City Road, Verka Milk Plant and Rajguru Nagar. Besides, this is the main road that leads to Jagraon, Moga, Bathinda and Ferozepur. So not only people commuting in the city, but also those going to other districts get hassled. With the festival season about to start, the situation will become worse. Commissioner of police Naunihal Singh said, “It is our responsibility to ensure smooth traffic, especially when the festival season is approaching and developmental projects are on. Joint commissioner of police Deepak Pareek has been asked to focus only on the traffic issues and get them resolved, so that people don’t suffer.”Pareek said, “We are making efforts to make the roads chaos free. I had contacted the NHAI project director for this task and we both had visited different spots on the Ferozepur Road to understand the problems and come up with solutions. We have identified a few points on Ludhiana-Ferozepur Road where we have started making required changes to ease congestion.” “Like Malhar Road-Ferozepur Road crossing is one of the most chaotic spots as developmental work on Malhar Road under the Smart City project is going on. We have made some changes to widen the crossing so that more vehicles can pass through. Then a stretch near PAU-Malhar Road was closed in advance and the project work is yet to start, so we are opening it for traffic after re-carpeting. We are also making changes in the barricading, so that it covers less space and the road gets a little wider. At other spots, we are widening the road by re-carpeting the damaged areas. The NHAI has left only a single road for the traffic at certain places, but we are opening other stretches to give more space to vehicles. In the coming few days the residents may face less congestion on this road,” he added. He said besides Ludhiana-Ferozepur Road, spots like Basti Jodhewal Chowk, Samrala Chowk, Shivpuri Chowk, Tajpur Road Crossing, Rahon Road, Jalandhar Bypass, Hambran Road near KVM School, Dugri Canal Bridge and Ghumar Mandi would also be covered in the next few days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/you-may-face-less-traffic-jams-this-festival-season/articleshow/85812114.cms||Payal Dhawan

On Tuesday, one of the new stations installed at Wadi was inaugurated. MPCB officials said the air quality monitoring station has been installed at Sant Gajanan Maharaj temple at Wadi. “At this location, particulate matter (PM) 2.5, PM10 and oxides of sulphur and nitrogen will be monitored. The operation and maintenance of this station will be carried out by Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology (VNIT),” said Anand Kare, regional officer, MPCB, Nagpur. Wadi is also now a part of the core city, said sub-regional officer AN Katole, adding, “We will be ensuring that the ambient air quality of Wadi is checked be in line with the National Air Quality Monitoring Programme (NAMP). The station at Wadi will be operated manually.” As reported by TOI earlier, the board is already monitoring NAMP stations at Civil Lines, MIDC Hingna, and Institution of Engineers on North Ambazari Road. “Currently, the city has only one continuous air quality monitoring station at Civil Lines,” said officials. In a positive development for the city, the three new monitoring stations to be set up will also be continuous air quality monitoring stations. “The locations will be Nagpur Municipal Corporation office at Mahal, VNIT campus in Bajaj Nagar and Laxminarayan Institute of Technology (LIT) on Amravati Road. The work of installing these stations has begun and we are expecting them to be functional in a few months,” added officials. In March this year, TOI was the first to report that the city will get new monitoring stations. Officials informed that the cost of one continuous air quality monitoring station is around Rs2.5 crore. “These stations have been approved and funded by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), which will also appoint a private operator for operation and maintenance of the stations. With this, we are hoping to get more reliable data on city’s air quality,” said officials. At present, CPCB has been calculating city’s air quality index (AQI) based on data from only one station at Civil Lines, which, environment experts say would never bring the real picture to the fore. Nagpur is one of the non-attainment cities of the country, and does not meet the prescribed air quality standards set by the Union environment ministry. The fact that it is surrounded by coal-fired power plants and a large number of industries makes the situation worse.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/wadi-gets-air-quality-monitoring-station-3-more-on-the-way/articleshow/85817106.cms||Manka Behl

Around 11 cities from Tamil Nadu are participating in the competition to resolve grievances on public transport by collaborating with citizens, NGOs and startups in the urban mobility sector. The contest is aimed at making public transport user-friendly and safe post the pandemic. The contest will jave two phases, problem identification and solution generation. Through online surveys, the civic body will record public opinion such as reasons for not using public transport, cleanliness status, accessibility and facilities they expect. Till Monday, the penultimate day of the survey, the corporation has received feedback from 4,164 people. The civic body will now collaborate with NGOs and startups to study the feedback and prepare suitable solutions. After creating a prototype idea for the problems identified, the startup identified will present solutions to resolve them while a jury selected by MoHUA will analyse the submission. The jury will select one or two pilot models for a problem statement such as accessibility, safety, digital payment and information dissemination. Based on the efficiency, the winning startups will be awarded Rs 10 lakh for a solution which will get them to stage 3 where they will scale up the model and evaluate for robustness for five months. The competition is likely to conclude by April.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/transport-4-all-over-4000-give-feedback/articleshow/85814737.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Thiruvananthapuram: High test positivity rate in Mudakkal panchayat causes concern||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: With over 4,000 Covid-19 cases and 47 fatalities, Mudakkal panchayat with its densely populated 44 colonies has recorded high test positivity rate (TPR), raising serious challenges for the health team in curbing the spread. In June, July and August, weekly TPRs of Mudakkal panchayat have always been above 10%. Between August 23 and 29, daily TPR of Mudakkal was recorded between 26.9% and 34.7%. Even before containment was fixed based on weekly population infection ratio, Mudakkal consistently figured in D category requiring stringent lockdown measures. At the start of this month, Mudakkal recorded a weekly TPR of 14.4%, by the middle of August, weekly positivity rates climbed to 27.5% and by the end of August, it had touched 31.7%. In July, when the second wave slowly seemed to recede in many local bodies, Mudakkal remained an isolated case. The weekly TPRs remained above 15% for almost all the weeks. The situation was worse in May and June, when cases had peaked uniformly across the local bodies. Stringent lockdown restrictions had almost nil impact and according to health officials associated with the panchayat, Mudakkal was a classic example of home-based clusters in closely populated colonies. “In June, people were willing to be shifted to domiciliary care centres of first-line treatment centres. However, by July and August, cases kept popping up in the colonies. There was a limit to which we could enforce restrictions inside houses. While Mudakkal remained more or less under strict containment for the last two to three months, it did little to control the spread because cases were spreading within the houses,” said an official. There were instances where as many as 80 residents of a single colony had to be shifted to a first-line centre. However, recently one person in a family tested positive in Chemboor colony and infection spread to 11 other family members because they agreed to be in home isolation but quarantine norms were seldom observed. There are practical difficulties for health team in keeping a constant tab on room isolation. A look at the case graph of local bodies in the last three to four months shows that Mudakkal is always in top 10 of the local bodies with the highest number of Covid cases. The panchayat authorities also admit to lapses in room isolation. “The reluctance of the infected people to come to domiciliary care centres and first-line treatment centres (CFLTCs) and presence of many colonies add to peak in infection rates. Mudakkal has one of the highest number of colonies for any panchayat in the district. When we identify a primary contact of an infected person, they refuse to be shifted to DCC or CFLTCs. In closely populated areas, there is no way to ensure proper room isolation. Sharing of eating spaces and toilets leads to fast spread of infection. The situation has been really challenging for us,” said Mudakkal grama panchayat president A Chandra Babu.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/high-tpr-in-mudakkal-panchayat-causes-concern/articleshow/85814772.cms||Aswin J Kumar

The decision was taken since finalising a new location would require forest clearances. The move came after chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami inspected the collapsed Ranipokhari bridge on Monday and directed the authorities to build a new bridge on the river within five months. Engineer in chief of Public Works Department (PWD) Hariom Sharma told TOI, “An inquiry officer inspected the location and after taking into consideration various facts, it was decided that a new bridge will be built on the same location.” Meanwhile, the chief minister also addressed public grievances at a camp in Bandiya in his constituency of Khatima in Udham Singh Nagar district. Among several developmental schemes for the region, the CM also announced heli-services for the famous Sikh shrine Shri Nanakmatta Sahib. “Heli services for devotees to Shri Nanakmatta Sahib will start soon. A rest house will also be constructed in Khatima for the devotees,” he said. The chief minister added that a Chhath Puja Ghat would be constructed in Melaghat area while the Jagbuda bridge would be constructed after discussions with the Nepalese government. A multi facility sports stadium will also be constructed at Van Chetna Maidan in Chakarpur. Prior to the program, Dhami along with Member of Parliament, Ajay Tamta and Nanakmatta MLA, PS Rana, had lunch at the house of Satish Maurya, a BJP worker. Dhami was also annoyed when a dozen official cars of the district administration joined the CM's convoy in Khatima. He said the long cavalcade was a “waste of money and resources”. Subsequently, the intelligence department sent letters to the superintendents of police of all 13 districts instructing them to keep out unwarranted vehicles during CM's programs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ranipokhari-bridge-to-be-rebuilt-nanakmatta-to-get-heli-services/articleshow/85812182.cms||Kautilya Singh

---||Mumbai||Presence of condom doesn’t mean sex consensual: Mumbai court||MUMBAI: The mere presence of a condom does not mean sex was consensual, a sessions court has observed during the bail hearing of a naval staffer arrested on charges of raping his colleague’s wife in April. “Merely because the condom was found at the spot of the incident is not sufficient to come to a conclusion that the complainant was having consensual relations with the applicant. The possibility of the accused using the condom to avoid further complications cannot be ruled out,” the court said, granting bail on the grounds that the probe was over and chargesheet has been submitted. The accused and the woman used to live in adjoining quarters. It is alleged that on April 29, when the woman’s husband was away for training in Kerala, the accused came over and offered her a chocolate. At about 3am, she felt severe headache and reached out to the accused for medicine. The man gave her paracetamol. She says that after sometime, he grabbed her, gagged and raped her. The woman allegedly tried to attack the accused with a blade, but was deterred. She then cut her wrist. The following day, the woman told her husband what had transpired. He returned to the city and went to the police. The accused sought bail on the grounds that he was falsely implicated. He claimed there was another man in the house, and so it was impossible to commit the offence. He submitted that a condom was found at the spot which indicated consensual sex.

The incident happened at Sasthavattom under Pothencode police station limits on Tuesday around 4.30pm. Prabha alias Sheeba hailing from Irinchayam near Nedumangad ,who worked as a domestic help, was returning home when she was attacked by Selvaraj alias Monu, 42, of Mangattukonam. According to police, the crime happened a short distance away from Sasthavattom Junction. Prabha was on her way back home when Selvaraj who was waiting for her on his scooter kicked her down, squatted over her and slit her throat using a knife. A local resident who witnessed the crime alerted the police. They soon rushed to the crime scene and took Prabha to hospital, but she was declared dead on arrival by the doctors. Selvaraj who left the crime scene after attacking Prabha was later taken into custody by police from Sasthavattom junction. Sources in the police said the crime was spurred over suspicion of infidelity. Selvaraj and Prabha were married for 10 years. Recently, quarrels have become frequent between them following which Prabha left home and went to live with her parents at Irinchayam. She also took their two children along with her. On Tuesday, she was walking to the Sasthavattom bus stop to catch a bus to Irinchayam when Selvaraj waylaid her. During the preliminary round of questioning, Selvaraj told the police that he was planning the crime for the past five days. He had even purchased a new knife for this purpose. The sources also said the accused admitted to the crime nonchalantly. When the police nabbed him he told them that he was going to his house to take a bath before visiting the police station to turn himself in. Selvaraj was married once before. He had three children in that marriage, including two daughters and a son. One of the daughters had allegedly died by suicide a few years ago. Prabha had married twice before. However, she did not have any children in those relationships. She leaves behind two children Abhinav, 7, and Abhaya, 5. Following the incident, senior police officers, including district police chief (rural) visited the crime scene.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/husband-arrested-for-murdering-estranged-wife-in-broad-daylight/articleshow/85814831.cms||---

At present, these men who get down into the gutters make do with 16. They have no masks to guard against poisonous gases of the manholes, no oxygen cylinder for air supply, no goggles to save their eyes, no safety cables to avoid falls, and no set of overalls to protect their skin.A controversy had erupted when Punjab Sanitation Employees Commission chairman Geja Ram had asked the civic body about these safety kits for the men who unclog the gutters. The MC will purchase oxygen cylinders, boots, jackets, helmet, and safety suit etc. under the Safai Mitra challenge. It claims that the safety kit will include all necessary things that the sewer cleaners require.Where robots and super-suction machines are unavailable and men must go down into the choked gutters, these kits will be of absolute necessity. The tenders for these kits have been floated. For now, the sewer cleaners go down into those holes without any kind of safety line or harness. The want of critical equipment has caused many untoward incidents.An argument had started between the MC officials and chairman of the sanitation employees commission when the latter claimed to have spotted sewer cleaning without these safety kits. On the other hand, the officials had alleged that the chairman had made the men enter the manhole intentionally. Operation and maintenance cell’s superintending engineer Rajinder Singh said: "We will purchase 1,641 safety kits, of which 1,000 will go to members of the field staff and the rest to the store. Once the field workers get these overalls, they will have to wear these at all cost." One of the sewer cleaners said it was difficult to do the job in this safety kit because the manholes were not wide enough to accommodate both man and machine, while the items also added to the carrying weight. Moreover, the workers don’t know how to use this apparatus, so first they expect to be trained.Cleaners uncomfortableSewer cleaners find it difficult to do the job in this safety kit because:-The manholes are not wide enough to hold both man and machineThe apparatus adds enormously to the carrying weightThe workers don’t know how to use this apparatusLack of training makes workers underconfident—Training for staff One of the MC officials claimed that there will be regular training for the sewer cleaners, so that they could use the safety kits properly.

The club’s annual report was released on Monday and according to the profit and loss statement, the club made profits worth Rs 8.14 crore in the financial year 2020-21, vis-à-vis a loss of Rs 1.62 crore in 2019-20. Club sources confirmed that the club was repaying its accumulated loss using its profits till last year due to which the overall profit was not seen on the profit and loss statement. “This year, the club’s income through investments has been withdrawn and parked in the bank. This has augmented the overall income of the club, thus reflecting profit in its profit and loss statement for the year 2020-21,” said the source. The club’s total income declined from Rs 27.55 crore to Rs 18.96 crore and its expenditure also declined from Rs 30.06 crore to Rs 13.63 crore during the financial year 2020-21. The decline in income as well as expenditure is attributed to the closure of the club due to the Covid-19 pandemic, lockdown and other restrictions through most part of the year. As few events, exhibitions and weddings were organised due to pandemic-related restrictions, the club suffered in terms of its rental income too. Karnavati Club announced on Saturday that its annual general meeting will be held on September 23, virtually. Ahead of the AGM, the elections will be held for the posts of 10 board of directors, who are set to retire this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/karnavati-club-reports-profit-in-pandemic-year/articleshow/85814838.cms||Niyati Parikh

---||Dehradun||Road built illegally in U’khand reserve forest, trees felled; NGT seeks action||Nainital: A 630-metre-long kuccha road — much larger than the length sanctioned by the authorities — was built without permission and muck dumped in a reserve forest in Uttarakhand’s Almora district while trees were also felled illegally for the project, according to the National Green Tribunal (NGT) which has directed the secretary of the public works department (PWD) to take “coercive action” against the perpetrators. These coercive measures could include restoration of forest area or compensation under the “polluter pays” principle, said the green tribunal, which also pulled up the state pollution control board and the forest department for “inadequate action” against violators. The tribunal’s order — which was passed earlier this month, but made public on Monday — observed that the departments had “failed to exercise their statutory authority” and directed them to send an ‘action taken’ report to the chief secretary, who will file a consolidated report before the tribunal within three months. The bench was hearing a plea filed in September 2020 by a Dwarahat resident, Jagdish Chandra Pandey, alleging irregularities in construction of a road in Chantharia reserve forest in Dwarahat tehsil. The road was built by a private agency hired by the PWD after a tender was issued for the project that aimed to provide connectivity to three villages of Kotila, Dawad and Suraikhet. The road is yet to undergo tar layering to make it motorable. While an in-principle sanction had been given to a 400-metre-long road, initial investigation by the forest department revealed that a 630-metre-long road had been built on the stretch after illegally felling 400 trees. A committee was set up in September last year on the orders of the NGT to investigate the allegations and it submitted its report in July this year. The committee, which included forest department officials and those from the pollution board, found that trees were felled illegally and the road design violated approved specifications. It also found that instead of dumping muck generated into designated sites, the agency involved had thrown it in the reserve forest. This was despite the fact that the project had a special provision of Rs 15 lakh for muck disposal. The investigation also revealed that the construction of the road had begun much before the agency complied with the conditions imposed by the authorities for in-principle approval of transfer of forest land. The committee held the range officer, section officer and beat officer responsible for failing to stop the construction of the road. After the committee’s report in July, a case was registered against the executive engineer of the PWD (Ranikhet) while a chargesheet was filed against the range officer of the forest department. A few lower level employees of the forest department were transferred. The NGT, however, held that the violations were very serious and the action taken was “inadequate”. “Illegal cutting of trees, construction of road on forest land and dumping of muck in reserved forest area calls for serious and meaningful action. Failure to take stringent action encourages lawlessness. No criminal case appears to have been registered though offences are shown to have been committed,” said the tribunal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/road-built-illegally-in-ukhand-reserve-forest-trees-felled-ngt-seeks-action/articleshow/85812296.cms||Prashant Jha
---||Kochi||A failed affair that resulted in a gruesome murder||Thiruvananthapuram: It was a grudge Arun (28) festered against 20-year-old Surya Gayathri for more than two years that finally culminated in her murder. She was attacked gruesomely on Monday afternoon and later succumbed to her injuries. Police said the accused and the victim had a very murky past. The victim’s mother was a physically challenged woman who sold lottery tickets at Kallingal junction near Nedumangad, near the state beverages corporation’s outlet here. The victim used to assist her mother from a very young age after school hours. The accused met Surya Gayathri in 2017 while visiting the liquor shop. He soon became friends with a then 16-year-old Surya Gayathri and her mother. “When her family had to vacate their former rented house, it was Arun who helped them find a new house near Aryanad. Soon he too started living with them and promised to marry the girl, said a senior police officer. Problems arose when the accused started controlling her too much. The police said though Arun went back to live in his own residence at Peyad, the girl’s family still wanted to marry her off to him. When he refused their pleas to live with them again, they retaliated by filing a complaint against him accusing him of stealing her mobile phone and chain. Based on this complaint, Arun was summoned to Aryanad station. The police told him to buy her a new phone to settle the issue though their preliminary inquiry found no evidence of such a crime. Later in 2020, the victim eloped with an employee of a toddy shop. But, soon problems arose between the two following which she returned to live with her family. On Monday Arun reached Nedumangad and met his old acquaintances near the liquor shop. He learned from them where the victim and family now reside. After consuming liquor he proceeded to her house and stabbed her. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/a-failed-affair-that-resulted-in-a-gruesome-murder/articleshow/85814882.cms||---

Both the parties have chosen key assembly seats to start the campaigns. BJP’s yatra will commence from Srinagar, the constituency of state Congress chief Ganesh Godiyal. Congress has decided to launch the campaign from Khatima, the constituency of chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami. Congress MLA from Kedarnath Manoj Rawat told TOI, “Our Parivartan Yatra would be taken out in four phases. The yatra will start from Khatima, which is chief minister Pushkar Singh Dhami’s constituency.” He added that in the second phase, the yatra would be conducted in Kumaon and six districts of Garhwal would be covered in the third leg. “The fourth and final phase of the yatra will be in Haridwar. We will have a team of dedicated youths, who will be present in all these campaigns. They would be led by experienced campaigners and senior leaders of different districts. During these yatras, we will apprise the people about our policies and the failures of the BJP government in the last four years,” he added. On the other side, BJP will launch its Jan Ashirwad Rally from Srinagar, a constituency which was won by Godiyal in 2012. He had unsuccessfully contested from the seat in 2017. Union minister of state for tourism Ajay Bhatt, CM Dhami and state chief Madan Kaushik are scheduled to participate in the yatra, which would be conducted by minister Dhan Singh Rawat, who represents the constituency.

---||Ludhiana||Chakar villagers need not travel far as NRIs open health centre||Chakar (Jagraon): As the pandemic overburdened medical services, NRIs here have set up a health centre so that villagers don’t have to travel to other areas for getting treatment and medicines.“We have about 200 NRI families in the village who are in Canada, the United States of America (USA), the United Kingdom (UK), Australia, New Zealand and Italy. Our village is an epitome of growth carried out by the NRIs who have developed a lake, waiting halls, NRI guest house-cum-panchayat ghar and installed CCTVs. NRI vikas committee gets money from them for development of the village. It is great that NRIs have come up with a health centre where villagers can get treatment and medicines,” said panch Gurmail Singh. Dr Roop Dass Bawa, the doctor who works at the centre, also appreciated the NRIs for the work. “The health centre started functioning on July 12. The motive is to bring treatment to the doorsteps of the needy. We also have a pharmacist and a trained health worker. We treat patients for fever, cough, cold, joint pains, abdomen pain, heart diseases, hypertension, diabetes and liver diseases. A villager has to get a card for Rs 50 and his whole family can get treatment for a year. The patients are given medicines at subsidised rates,” said Dr Bawa, who retired as a senior medical officer (SMO). “OPD cases are attended here and severe cases are referred to nearby advanced health centres. We plan to set up a laboratory and an x-ray machine as well. We get a salary for working here. The village has a health sub-centre, but it is run by a pharmacist though there is a post of doctor there,” he added. The centre daily gets 20-25 patients, including those from neighbouring villages like Lakha and Rama, said Dr Bawa, who, after completing MD in medicine, worked at a government hospital in Hathur for 10 years, so he had developed a bond with the people of Chakkar. The staff said the centre has come up at a village common facility that has been renovated. Patients said the health centre was a boon for the village. “We are thankful to the NRIs for providing health facilities,” said 76-year-old Gurdev Singh, who had come to the centre for treatment of stomach-related issues.“There are certain areas where the government health set-ups lack proper staff, so patients have to go to bigger hospitals. It is a good gesture by the NRIs and should be replicated in more villages,” said former SMO Dr Rajinder Gulati.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/chakar-villagers-need-not-travel-far-as-nris-open-health-centre/articleshow/85812285.cms||Shariq Majeed

One mini-truck fell hundreds of feet into the ghat. Mahesh Patil, the executive engineer of the National Highway Authority Of India (NHAI), told TOI: “The rescue and road-opening operations are being carried out on war footing. However, it is likely to take 24 hours to clear of the road.” Patil confirmed that the driver of the truck that was washed away was dead. Earlier in the day, nearly a dozen vehicles reported damages after being hit by rubble. Authorities said many vehicles were stranded on the ghat section on National Highway 211 when the landslides struck within minutes of each other. The landslides disrupted traffic movement on the Dhule-Aurangabad-Solapur highway, which is a key route taken by goods vehicles from Rajasthan and Gujarat to reach Marathwada and Vidarbha regions as well as several other southern states. Teams of the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) and National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) rushed to the landslide locations to clear the debris and open at least one lane of the highway at soon as possible. Jalgaon district collector Abhijit Raut, SP Pravin Munde and other senior officials visited the incident spot to take stock of the situation. Aurangabad district collector Sunil Chavan, Kannad police officers as well as Kannad MLA Udaysingh Rajput and others also carried out a spot inspection of the accessible sections. Pravin Munde, the Jalgaon SP, said, “There were landslides at eight locations in the Kannad ghat section of the Dhule-Solapur highway (NH 211). The landslides started around 2 am on Tuesday and the district administration started getting the calls around 3 am.” “Almost 80% of the work to clear the debris is over. However, the road would be opened only by Wednesday,” said Munde. Deputy SP Shantaram Valvi, of the Highway Police, Nashik, who also visited the spot said that post-afternoon there was no traffic congestion on the highway. Several teams of the highway police along with NHAI personnel were deployed along with excavators to clear the mud, boulders, and trees that covered the surface of the highway in the ghat section. As per late evening reports, only one section was yet to be cleared of the debris To ensure there are no further traffic snarls, the Aurangabad rural police have set up checkpoints on either side of the ghat. Traffic is being diverted through the interior roads via the Panpoi-Chapaner-Shiur Bangla-Nandgaon-Chalisgaon route.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/8-landslides-in-kannad-ghat-truck-washed-away-1-dead/articleshow/85809161.cms||Santosh Sonawane

Of the total 317 cases reported, 165 were reported in the past five days, said police. In the run up to Janmashtami festival, the city police registered 149 cases in the past three days. The officials said that the average arrest per case was 5 persons, which increased to nearly 6 in the last three days. Of the 1,685 people arrested for gambling in August, 884 people were arrested in three days since midnight of August 29. This was about 52.5% of the total arrested in August. Of these, 415 people — the highest number — were booked in 69 cases on Tuesday, while 325 arrests were made in 54 cases on August 30. Also, the worth of articles seized in the last three days totalled Rs 24.87 lakh. The tradition of gambling in the month of Shravan was quite high with cops making seizure of Rs 51 lakh, including Rs 26 lakh in cash, from gamblers. In Gujarat, many observe the tradition of Shravanio Jugar (gambling), which began on August 8 this year. People, including entire families, gamble on Satam and Aatham (Krishna Janmashtami) in the state, mainly in Saurashtra. In July, the city police filed 149 cases, nabbed 636 persons and seized Rs 21.48 lakh in cash used in gambling offences. Senior police officials said that there is no change in the traditional way of gambling, especially during the Satam-Aatham festivals. Apart from professional gamblers, who are often caught, the city police registered an increase of cases due to this tradition of gambling. The officials said that if one looked at the trend, more cases of gambling were found in the eastern part of the city. “However, during festive days, one would find cases from all across the city. People move to farmhouses during this period to gamble and hold celebrations,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/52-of-aug-gambling-cases-in-5-days/articleshow/85814919.cms||Himanshu Kaushik

The duo and nine others have targeted 71 men so far. The complaint was filed on Monday. According to cybercrime police, the other nine accused are absconding. The cheaters’ ring came to light after a complaint was lodged by a youth from Sanand. The cops stated that the two arrested are Sunny Parekh, 20, and Neha Parekh, 22, both residents of Sayan, Surat. The modus operandi was to send a message to men asking them to call if they wished to join the friendship club. The duo along with others would ask the men who took the bait to pay a joining fee and a membership charge. There was an extra bill for having visiting cards printed. The gang would then get the men thus lured to talk to women and would ask them to deposit money in the accounts of the main accused, his sister, and other members of the gang. The gang has so far cheated 71 people to the tune of Rs 41.49 lakh. The Sanand youth contacted the cybercrime department. A case was lodged under the Indian Penal Code’s sections dealing with cheating and breach of trust. The cybercrime cops set up a surveillance op and raided Center Point complex and other places in Surat and arrested the brother-sister duo. The absconding accused are Kevin alias Bhavesh Joghani, Pratik Joghani, Bhura, Doli Desai, Amit, Pavan, Shraddha alias Jara, Mayur, and Rupal Satpara.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/friendship-con-man-sister-said-hi-victims-bid-bye-to-cash/articleshow/85814881.cms||---

The statement is believed to have been made at a recent media interaction which detailed steps taken by the government to tackle rain-related damage. Uttarakhand has seen widespread misery, landslides and cloudbursts, since monsoon hit. In the video, Rawat, who is also the state’s health minister, is heard claiming that he will soon submit a presentation so the technology can be used in other states and countries as well. The minister could not be contacted for comments. This is the latest in a series of controversial remarks made by leaders of the ruling party. Earlier this year, former chief minister Tirath Rawat said that "The US had ruled India for 200 years" and that "ripped jeans worn by women led to the society's degeneration", drawing nationwide outrage. Meanwhile, the opposition took a jibe at the statement, with former chief minister and Congress veteran Harish Rawat saying, “Uttarakhand chief minister Pushkar Dhami should propose his cabinet minister's name for Bharat Ratna.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/working-on-app-to-control-rain-ukhand-min/articleshow/85812331.cms||---

The IMD has warned of heavy rainfall in both the districts in the next two days as well. Igatpuri, Malegaon, Surgana and Nandgaon talukas in Nashik district received heavy rainfall and the district overall recorded an average rainfall of 18.2mm. However, the Sinnar taluka did not get any showers, while Deola and Niphad received very light rain. Nashik city reported 9mm rainfall in the 24-hour period till Tuesday morning. The Water Resources Department (WRD) in Nashik said it is keeping a close watch on the water levels in the dams, including the Gangapur dam. At present, the water level of the Gangapur dam has touched 90% of its capacity and water will be discharged only if there is more rain in the catchment areas. The water levels in two other dams — Kashyapi and Gautami — are 66% and 77%, respectively. The catchment areas of the Gangapur dam complex are yet to receive heavy rainfall. Therefore, there is no plan to discharge water yet, said the officials. Bharat Dighole, the president of Maharashtra state onion growers’ association, said some parts of the district have got good showers, but they have not been continuous. The recent rain will benefit the kharif crops, he added. Like Nashik, Ahmednagar district too received good rain in several areas. After an IMD forecast of heavy rain, the district disaster management authority has sounded an alert for the people in low-lying areas.

---||Nashik||Flash floods in Chalisgaon & other Jalgaon villages, 1 dead||Nashik: A 60-year-old woman, more than 200 head of livestock and several vehicles were washed away in the flash floods in Chalisgaon in North Maharashtra’s Jalgaon district in the early hours of Tuesday. Chalisgaon, located about 160 km from Nashik city, is an important agriculture hub of the Jalgaon district. Abhijit Raut, the Jalgaon district collector, told TOI that there was a cloudburst in the Ajanta hill range (Chalisgaon is a part of the range). “There was torrential rainfall in the entire range. The area received more than 150mm rainfall in a short span of 6-7 hours starting late on Monday night. This caused the two local rivers — Titur and Dongri — to swell and led to flash floods in Chalisgaon town and parts of the taluka,” said Raut. “As many as 10 villages in the taluka and parts of the Chalisgaon town were either partially or fully inundated. The administration deployed a team of state disaster response force (SDRF) to rescue people and shift them to safer locations,” added Raut. The district administration continues to be on an alert as the IMD has predicted more rain in Jalgaon district over the next 24 hours. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had a phone conversation with Jalgaon guardian minister Gulabrao Patil, who was at Chalisgaon along with the district collector and SP Dr Pravin Mundhe. “I told the CM that the damage was extensive. People have lost their livestock and standing crops in rural Chalisgaon,” said Patil adding that he has directed the district revenue department to immediately assess the quantum of loss so that the state government can be informed. Patil said the issue would be taken up in the next Cabinet meeting. According to officials, a 60-year-old woman, who was sleeping in her hut at the Wakdi village, along the banks of the Dongri river, was washed away. “The water entered her hut after 3 am and she was caught unawares. We found her body stuck to a tree branch near a local bus stop at 9 am,” said Ganesh Patil, the police patil of the village. Raut said as per the initial feedback, more than 200 head of cattle were washed away and crops too were damaged. Chalisgaon MLA Mangesh Chavan said the flash floods have devastated a section of people in the town and the taluka. “My feedback is that over 500 animals were washed away. We are also ascertaining if more people are missing. Power supply has been disrupted in many of the affected areas,” he added. Chalisgaon tehsildar Amol More said that water entered the houses and shops in low-lying areas of Chalisgaon town and 40-45 families were shifted to nearby school buildings. Goods kept in the shops were damaged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/flash-floods-in-chalisgaon-other-jalgaon-villages-1-dead/articleshow/85809186.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

---||Nagpur||An august start on Covid front in August for Vidarbha||NAGPUR: With lowest ever new cases in the last 15 months, fewest deaths due to Covid-19 in 16 months, and only 281 patients under treatment in entire region — August has proved to be the best month for Vidarbha in terms of Covid-19 control. In the last 31 days, all 11 districts of Vidarbha combined have reported 932 new cases. Less than these (294) cases in a month were reported only in April 2020. Since then, no month has reported less than 1,000 cases till July 2021. This means, August was better than April 2020, when even the first wave was not fully set in. “Statistically, August has many good indicators for Vidarbha. If we get one more month like this, we can certainly claim the pandemic is going to become an endemic now,” said epidemiologist Anand Thatte. According to him, not only the numbers but many other factors are important in August. “Vaccination has played its role and the effects are visible now. The month has reported only 17 deaths due to Covid-19. This means, we have successfully curbed the mortality,” Thatte added. Health officials have also observed that it’s almost eight weeks since the rural schools have started functioning, but no notable spike in any school or village was noticed. A senior official from divisional health department told TOI that they are monitoring the situation very closely. Authorities are still taking careful steps as the threat of third wave is still there. “Next six to eight weeks will be crucial. We are expecting a little surge in new cases. If the festive season passes off without spikes in cases and deaths, it is going to be a milestone for us,” said an official. Doctors told TOI that the time is favourable, but we must not to become irresponsible. “Till the time the virus is not coming with renewed variant which is more lethal or infective, we are not going to see major surge or the situation like second wave,” said infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde. He also said that the Delta+ variant is not a major threat as it is not more lethal or fatal than Delta, which initiated the second wave in Vidarbha during February this year. Members of the state Covid task force said people should continue wearing mask, follow Covid distancing and avoid unnecessary crowding. “Being overprotected is sometimes better than being under-protected,” said Dr Ravindra Sarnaik.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/an-august-start-on-covid-front-in-august/articleshow/85817229.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Mangaluru||Physiotherapists undertake tele-rehabilitation amidst pandemic||Mangaluru: Just as educational institutions are adapting to a blended mode of education this academic year, physiotherapists, especially those treating patients with stroke, Parkinson’s and post Covid-19 breathing complications, are opting for a blended mode of treatment. The nationwide lockdown during the first wave of Covid-19 last year, had an impact on the recovery rate, especially among stroke patients. Hence, most of the physiotherapists, especially those dealing with neurological rehabilitation of patients, have switched to tele-rehabilitation, which is a blend of online and offline modes of treatment, said Dr Amreen Mahmood, assistant professor, physiotherapy, KMC hospital, Mangaluru. She said: “Through tele-rehabilitation, we have been able to provide real-time consultation, supervision and guidance. We are seeing around 18 patients per month for tele-physiotherapy, including Covid-19 patients as well as paediatric cases and adults with neurological conditions. However, it is still in the early stages, and we are in the process of establishing the feasibility of such services in Mangaluru. Wherever, internet connectivity is an issue or real-time consultation is not possible, we are trying our best by providing digital devices that are connected to apps to record data. This online consultation, coupled with once-a-month visit to the clinic, is ensuring that patients’ rehabilitation is not affected.’’ She said worldwide reviews and experimental studies have shown that tele-rehabilitation is equally effective as clinical based rehabilitation for stroke and Parkinson’s. “We are seeing an improvement in mobility and quality of life. However, tele-rehabilitation is yet to be tried on patients who are in the rehabilitation phase after spinal cord and brain injuries. Meanwhile, a private hospital in Bengaluru is conducting weekly sessions for senior citizens across India. They are taking up hour-long real-time exercises,” Dr Amreen said. “The challenges are many. There is always a fear if the patient falls or sustains an injury. However, the Australian Stroke foundation has collated tele-rehabilitation resources, and the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada has also issued guidelines for tele-rehabilitation. Hence, there are guidelines on the exercises that can be taken up and a severity assessment is conducted. A lot of resources have come up in the last two years,” Dr Amreen noted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/physiotherapists-undertake-tele-rehabilitation-amidst-pandemic/articleshow/85812327.cms||Deepthi Sanjiv
---||Vadodara||PI denied bail to look after ailing wife||Vadodara: Former inspector of Fatehgunj police station, D B Gohil, who is in jail in connection with the custodial death of Sheikh Babu Nishar was denied interim bail by a sessions court here. Gohil had sought bail on August 19 on the grounds that his wife was suffering from kidney ailments and had been advised further treatment. He also stated that his sister-in-law passed away recently due to cancer and he believes that his wife could also be suffering from cancer. Seeking interim bail for 30 days, Gohil also told the court that he has two kids and there is nobody to look after them. Opposing Gohil’s bail plea, the investigating officer submitted a report which mentioned that the suspended cop has three brothers and his mother too is staying with his wife to take care of her medical treatment and look after the children. The court of principal district judge M R Mengdey upheld the police report and also took into account that Gohil was released on interim bail for 10 days in July.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/pi-denied-bail-to-look-after-ailing-wife/articleshow/85811197.cms||---

The accused, Gregory Yermadeh, a native of Benin City in Nigeria, is the mastermind of the racket wherein people were lured to sell kidney for Rs four crore through online advertisements.  Yermadeh had arrived in India on a visitor visa and was operating the racket for the last three years. He stayed in Bengaluru but was on run for the past one month after his associates were arrested in July.  Earlier, police had arrested Toty Dago Gregoire Kouduo Toti Augustin, 33, a native of Ivory Coast and Tikendrajeet Dhirnchandra Bora, 30, of Bengaluru. Toty developed websites that looked similar to leading hospitals of the country and posted advertisements looking for kidney sellers.  “In this racket, police caught hold of top operators first. They duped poor people who were ready to sell their organs for money,” said Y A Gohil, assistant commissioner of police, cybercrime cell.  Cops claimed that a total Rs nine lakh has been blocked in various bank accounts of the accused.  The complaint was lodged on July 13 by Arbaz Rana, a 25-year-old man dealing in used cars, who was duped between September to October 2020. Rana told police that there was no business for the past three years and he wanted money to get his sister married. Due to the financial crisis, he had decided to sell his kidney and make quick money. Investigation revealed the accused offered Rs 4 crore to Rs 7 crore for a kidney on fake websites of top hospitals like Manipal Hospital, Apollo, Max Super Speciality, Lilavati, Tata Memorial, Garden City, Fortis and others. They also created fake websites for forex trading and bitcoin investment. Police found that Tory created fake websites offering jobs in airlines, agriculture, oil and gas, construction, dairy and courier delivery sectors in the UK, Canada and the US. He created fake websites to exchange old currency and also created separate websites offering visas of different countries.  They used four e-mail IDs that look similar to IDs of RBI officials.  Trusting one of these websites, Rana contacted a Whatsapp number mentioned in one of them in September 2020. The woman on the other end introduced herself as Dr Shilpa Kumari of Manipal Hospital in Bengaluru. Police claimed that it was a fake identity given by the woman. Later Rana was contacted by different individuals over phone and email.  The accused convinced Rana that he will get Rs two crore before the surgery and the remaining amount will be paid afterwards. They demanded payment of various charges before the surgery, and believing them Rana paid money in multiple transactions through online payment. In a short period Rana paid Rs 14.78 lakh. When they continued demanding money for charges, Rana realized that he was cheated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/mastermind-of-online-kidney-selling-racket-nabbed/articleshow/85812723.cms||---

---||Kolhapur||Maha govt to study effect of Almatti height increase||Kolhapur: The Maharashtra government is going to study the effect of the likely increase in the height of the Almatti dam across the Krishna river. Recently, Karnataka chief minister Basavaraj Bommai said he was considering a visit to Delhi with the proposal to increase the height of the dam from 519m to 524m. He also said that since Maharashtra is also a party to the Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal, leaders from Maharashtra have been consulted. Bommai said preliminary discussions on the issue have been held with NCP chief Sharad Pawar and Maharashtra irrigation minister Jayant Patil. He even said that Pawar has suggested a meeting with the Centre to discuss the matter. The tribunal had given a verdict in favour of the Karnataka government to increase Almatti’s height. Irrigation minister Jayant Patil said: “During the floods last month, Karnataka government was cooperative in carrying out discharge from the Almatti dam. We will discuss their plans to increase the dam’s height. Taking such an extreme decision suddenly is not good. I have asked the irrigation department officials to conduct a study to figure out the actual effect of the dam’s height increase. Based on the conclusions of the department, we will decide whether to discuss the matter with Karnataka government or not.” The Maharashtra government is taking the issue seriously. It is a general perception that the backwater pressure of the dam causes floods in the upstream areas of Sangli and Kolhapur districts. A panel appointed under former principal secretary of irrigation department Nandkumar Vadnere had maintained that though the 2019 floods were mostly due to extremely heavy rainfall, a study needs to be conducted, with the help of mathematical models, to study the actual cause and effect. Karnataka also needs to consult with other states — Andhra Pradesh and Telangana — before it initiates steps to increase the height of the dam as both these states too are party to the tribunal. These states have maintained that the increase in the dam height will obstruct the flow of water and may leave their states dry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/maha-govt-to-study-effect-of-almatti-height-increase/articleshow/85809232.cms||---

Udupi deputy director of public instructions (DDPI) N H Nagur has directed all block education officers to commence classes as per the fresh guidelines. Nagur told TOI that schools have been asked to conduct physical classes for half a day, only in the morning. “The government has allowed districts with less than 2% test positivity rate to commence classes for classes IX and X. The positivity rate in Udupi is less than 2%, and hence, all government, aided and private schools may commence half-day on-campus classes for classes IX and X, following SOPs. All students should compulsorily bring a consent letter from parents to attend on-campus classes. Parents should also confirm in the letter, that their wards have not been experiencing symptoms of Covid-19,” Nagur said. Students must bring drinking water and snacks from their homes. However, schools have also been asked to make hot water available for students, he said. “Though classes will begin on Wednesday, physical attendance will not be mandatory for students. They may continue to attend online classes, and other alternative methods. Schools have been asked to keep classrooms clean and sanitised as per the government SOP. Students should maintain social distancing in classrooms and school premises. Heads of institutions should hold meetings of parents through school development and monitoring committees (SDMC) to implement safety measures,” Nagur said. In Udupi, there are 106 government high schools, 70 aided schools and 116 private institutions, which are expected to commence on-campus classes for grades IX and X, he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/udupi-to-conduct-half-day-on-campus-classes-for-classes-ix-x/articleshow/85812451.cms||---

This was the highest number of people receiving the Covid-19 shots in a day in any district of Maharashtra. The district health department had roped in 200 vaccination sites across Pune rural on Tuesday for the mega inoculation drive. The rural belt registered a record turnout of 1.68 lakh beneficiaries. Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer (CEO) of the Pune zilla parishad, told TOI, “This was not only a state record for the single-day vaccination figures, but we are sure that it could also be a national record. All the stakeholders actively participated in the drive. The result was the huge response.” Prasad said, “We had 1.5 lakh doses from Bajaj group and 1 lakh vaccines came from the state. We efficiently used our gram panchayat network for the initiative. There was effective cooperation from the health and police department in terms of crowd management and complying with the social distancing norms at the vaccination drive.” Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, told TOI, “If we get more such private players to offer vaccines in future, we can really boost the inoculation drive across the district.” Deshmukh said the district received 13 lakh doses (Covishield and Covaxin) in August and the number was likely to further increase in September.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/2-34l-vaccine-beneficiaries-get-doses-in-24-hours-in-dist/articleshow/85814977.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Aurangabad||Extended rainy season likely: Experts||Aurangabad: Weather experts have predicted that the current rainy season may get extended up to early December in Marathwada and other parts of the state. The intensity of rainfall during such extended period, however, may be not as vigorous as witnessed during past instances of protracted rainy season. Shriniwas Aundhkar, director of city based APJ Abdul Kalam Astro Space and Science Centre, on Tuesday said that the average Equatorial Pacific Sea Surface Temperature may go down in near future producing La Niña conditions. “La Niña is a complex weather system that occurs every few years and causes extended rainfall in parts of the country. As per early forecast, the weather systems concerned may evolve in such a manner that Marathwada and other parts of the state witness rainfall beyond the stipulated period,” he said. The Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), the difference in sea surface temperature between a western pole in the Arabian Sea and an eastern pole in the eastern Indian Ocean, gradually becoming negative may reduce the amount of showers during the possible extended period of the rainy season, Aundhkar said. Echoing the possibility of extended rainy season, physicist and meteorologist Prof Kirankumar Johare said the current cloud conditions also give a hint that the rainy season was here to stay for a longer period that usual. “Going by the current weather systems, the monsoon has now just settled over Marathwada and other parts. We can observe Nimbus clouds at present which imply that extended rainy season is likely,” he said. Marathwada observes rainy season from June to September during which the region gets average 679 mm rainfall. The region, so far, received 94% of total expected showers, shows official data.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/extended-rainy-season-likely-experts/articleshow/85809285.cms||---

---||Thiruvananthapuram||DDCs lose plot sans statutory backing||Thiruvananthapuram: Eleven months after government created the post of district development commissioners (DDCs) and appointed 10 young IAS officers, the role of DDCs remains unclear, without statutory backing, a well-defined chain of command or infrastructural facilities. Government had appointed 10 officers as DDCs through an executive order in October last year, in districts except Kasaragod, Kottayam, Alappuzha and Pathanamthitta, after serving as sub-collectors. DDCs were envisaged to represent the collector in important forums or meetings which the collector may be unable to attend. It was said they would report to the chief secretary through collectors, who will also be their reporting officer for the annual performance appraisal report. The order had said that they would be at par with the district collector, in terms of vehicle, housing, staff and security. “However, a few months after they began functioning, it has come to light that without statutory powers, they have no role in district management. Many of those who have been appointed as DDCs have realized the limitations and have taken up the matter at appropriate forums,” said a senior official. Contrary to expectations, the post of DDCs, instead of improving the quality of governance is now leading to cross-functionalities, confusion and conflict. Sans financial powers, effective monitoring and reviewing of projects, committees and boards are practically impossible. DDCs are now demanding they be given more statutory responsibility by rechristening them in multiple positions including executive vice-chairperson of district tourism promotion council, in district planning office, National Health Mission, as CEO in district disaster management authority, a key role with a well-designed system encompassing the offices of assistant development commissioners and project director (DRDA). “Every district officer has a clear cut chain of command above them and below, with specific controlling authorities. When DDCs were appointed, it should have been done by providing them with a clear authority, without disturbing the existing framework,” said a senior government secretary. Most DDCs were appointed during the time they were originally posted at headquarters after field assignment. Several officers feel that the present condition and status of DDCs, are counterproductive to the original idea of grooming them as district collectors in future. “Young IAS officers are usually appointed as heads of directorates and other posts in state headquarters after they complete their sub-collectorship, which will help them to learn how things work and will be useful while becoming district collectors to liaise with the headquarters. Appointing them in posts like DDCs should be done only with a clear-cut role as the districts already have a collector, panchayat president and planning officer,” said former cabinet secretary KM Chandrasekhar. In several other states, IAS officers are appointed as additional district magistrates before they become collectors. However, in Kerala, additional district magistrates are non-IAS officers who are from the revenue department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/ddcs-lose-plot-sans-statutory-backing/articleshow/85814990.cms||KP Saikiran
---||Madurai||HC asks DGP to consider protection for RTI activists||Madurai: The Madras high court on Tuesday directed the director general of police (DGP) to consider and pass orders in accordance with law, on a representation seeking to constitute a special task force for the safety of RTI activists. The court passed the order while disposing of the public interest litigation filed by A Ramakrishnan, an RTI activist from Theni district. The petitioner stated that RTI Act is a boon to the society as it ensures the transparency in administration and brings out several malpractices and misappropriation of public funds. He said that several RTI activists are facing threats by the people who are involved in misdeeds. Realizing the importance of safeguarding the RTI activists, the Union ministry of home affairs in a letter dated June 14, 2013, directed all the states to constitute a special task force. He stated that when he sought an RTI query in this regard, the state government stated that the letter had been communicated to the DGP in July 2013 for appropriate action. Though he sent a representation to the government in July 2021 seeking to constitute a special task force, no steps were taken. Hence, the petitioner approached the HC Madurai bench seeking relief. The government pleader submitted that in case of individuals who face threats, the government after examining the case of the individuals would provide security to them. The counsel for the petitioner submitted that instead of giving any positive direction to the authorities, it would suffice if a direction is given to consider the petitioner’s representation. The division bench of justices M Duraiswamy and K Murali Shankar directed the DGP to consider the petitioner’s representation and pass orders on merits and in accordance with law within four months. However, the court clarified that the direction shall not be mistaken as any positive direction in favour of the petitioner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/hc-asks-dgp-to-consider-protection-for-rti-activists/articleshow/85815035.cms||---
---||Kolhapur||Vaccine hesitancy prompts Kolhapur admin to start spot registration||Kolhapur: The vaccine hesitancy among beneficiaries in the 18-44 age group from rural areas of Kolhapur district has prompted the administration to allow spot registration. Since the last few days, slots of 200-300 doses reserved for the younger population are remaining unbooked at most vaccination centres. When the drive was initiated a month ago, the slots were booked within a span of few minutes. Many beneficiaries even travelled from distant places to reach vaccination centres for getting the jab. However, the scenario has changed now. The officials claim that there are several reasons for the slots remaining unbooked at rural centres. Yogesh Sale, district health officer of Kolhapur zilla parishad, said, “Many do not know how to book the slots online despite it being easy and can be done through any internet connected smartphone. Around 10% younger population has become lethargic — meaning they are postponing getting vaccinated mainly because of knowing adequate availability of vaccines at centres. Also, as Covid-19 cases are coming down, the turnout of beneficiaries due to fear factor has reduced.” The district has 18.52 lakh citizens in the 18 to 44 age group. So far, 6 lakh doses have been administered to beneficiaries from this age group. On the other hand, 18 lakh doses have been administered to those above 45 years of age. Total 24 lakh doses have so far been administered to beneficiaries in the entire district. Authorities concerned said that vaccine hesitancy is not witnessed in urban areas of Kolhapur district. For instance, around 70% beneficiaries arriving at vaccination centres in Kolhapur city are young and the slots at all 13 centres get booked within minutes. “We are also exploring other options to get young population vaccinated as early as possible. Along with spot registrations, we are also planning to start camps for targeted age groups,” said Sale.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/vaccine-hesitancy-prompts-kolhapur-admin-to-start-spot-registration/articleshow/85809359.cms||---
---||Madurai||Won’t force students to attend physical classes, Tamil Nadu govt tells Madras HC||MADURAI: The Tamil Nadu government on Tuesday informed the Madras high court that school students would not be compelled to attend physical classes and would be permitted to opt for online classes as an alternative. The court was hearing a public interest litigation filed by K Abdul Vahabudeen of Tirunelveli district seeking a direction to permit the students to opt for attending classes online. The petition was filed following the state government's decision to reopen schools for students from classes IX to XII on September 1. The petitioner stated that most of the parents are in fear of sending their schools for physical classes in the absence of Covid-19 vaccination for children below 18 years. Since there are apprehensions about the third wave of Covid-19 pandemic, the students should not be compelled to attend physical classes, he stated. Advocate general R Shanmugasundaram, appearing for the state, submitted that the government had taken a decision to reopen the schools by taking all precautionary measures and by strictly following the Covid-19 standard operating procedures. He submitted that the school education department had passed a GO on August 26, wherein it was stated that online distance mode of learning would continue. As per the GO, the students willing to continue education from their homes would be permitted to do so with the consent of their parents. He further submitted that the students would not be compelled to attend physical classes and would be permitted to opt for online classes as an alternative. Taking cognizance of the submissions, a division bench of justices M Duraiswamy and K Murali Shankar directed the state government to file an affidavit in this regard and adjourned the case to September 7.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/wont-force-students-to-attend-physical-classes-govt-tells-hc/articleshow/85814998.cms||Kaushik Kannan
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Bevco’s mobile app plan runs into rough weather||Thiruvananthapuram: Kerala State Beverages Corporation’s (Bevco) plans to launch a mobile app interface for the newly-launched online booking facility at its outlets has run into rough weather following Google’s refusal to accept the same in Google Play Store for download. According to top sources in state-run Bevco, negotiations are on with Google authorities to explore the possibilities of convincing them about the nature of the monopolistic role Bevco plays in stocking and retail sales of foreign liquor in the state. “Google authorities say that their policy doesn’t allow the beverages corporation to list the mobile app for booking liquor against payment over the mobile app. We hope Google will eventually accept our request. But we are not in a position to comment officially about the process presently,” said Bevco sources. Bevco, which dumped the BevQ mobile app for queue management at beverage outlets during Covid-19 first wave, introduced its own online booking and payment facility early this month. “There is no heavy rush in the web-based online platform, using which consumers can book beverages in select outlets in six districts. They can pay the money online and collect the bottles from the outlets by producing the payment proof. We hope it will pick up and cater to the consumers’ needs even if the mobile app doesn’t come through,” said a senior Bevco official. BevQ was accepted in Google Play Store as it was only a queue management app, which had no direct connection to selection of booze or payment, he added. Bevco is planning to expand the current online booking and payment facility to more districts and shops. It’s suggestion for home delivery of liquor during the pandemic restrictions was turned down by the state government. Amendment in state excise policy is a prerequisite for introducing home delivery of liquor. “Presently, there are no legal impediments on the excise side as far as booking liquor through mobile app is concerned. But home delivery is not permitted as per existing rules. We are not sure what prevents Bevco from listing a mobile app for booking and payment purposes,” said excise commissioner S Ananthakrishnan IPS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/bevcos-mobile-app-plan-runs-into-rough-weather/articleshow/85815065.cms||B S Anilkumar

Earlier this month, the government had allowed the foreign nationals residing in India and those with the first dose vaccinated outside the country to register on the CoWin portal using their passport as an identity document for registration and get inoculated against Covid-19. “The creation of an independent category will make it easier for the foreign nationals to get the Covid-19 shot. The introduction of the category will accelerate the pace of vaccination and also help us keep a record of such individuals and their inoculation status,” N K Arora, chairman of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation, told TOI. A significant number of foreign nationals are living in India, especially in large metropolitan areas. “The creation of the category will also encourage foreign nationals and those who have taken the first dose outside India to get fully immunized by taking the second dose of Covid vaccine,” Arora said. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director, health services, Maharashtra, said, “The full immunization of the foreign nationals will ease doing business and work as an entry pass in places where there are restrictions related to travel or entry.” The creation of a separate category is also a confidence-building measure and helps in prioritizing the vaccination. “There is a lot of presence of foreign nations, mainly in big cities such as Pune and Mumbai. Besides, there are quite a few Indians who have received their first shot outside India when they were on business/work-related trip and now they are back in the country and want to take the second shot,” said Pune’s Covid immunization chief, Suryakant Devkar. Besides, the potential of the spread of Covid-19 is high due to higher population density in big cities. To counter any possibility of such occurrence, it was important to vaccinate all eligible persons, an official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/centre-starts-separate-slots-for-foreigners-on-cowin/articleshow/85815008.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Drunk man’s phone, cash officially seized by Kheda cops||AHMEDABAD: In dry Gujarat, police sometimes tend to act ‘pro-actively’ where they put the law aside and take action according to their will. This happened with a man from Nadiad who was found drunk. Kheda police not only booked him under prohibition laws but also seized his mobile phone and Rs 5,000 from his possession, claiming that the money and phone were used in the offence. On August 28, when a team of Chaklasi police on patrol at Shurashamal village in Nadiad taluka of Kheda district, they found a man roaming about in an inebriated condition.  According to the FIR filed by Chaklasi police, they stopped the man and asked him walk in a straight line. As he failed the field sobriety test, police began the procedure to book him under prohibition laws. The cops checked his pockets and found 25 Rs-200 notes and a mobile phone. Police personnel seized the money and phone claiming them to be “incriminating materials”. According to prohibition laws, police have to send a person suspected to be drunk for a medical examination to ascertain that he or she has consumed liquor, but there is no provision to seize his or her possessions. PSI Vishal Shah of Chaklasi police said the police personnel were forced to seize the accused’s possessions as he misbehaved with one of the cops. “We usually frisk a person if they are found to be committing a crime. Any object belonging to the accused is treated as incriminating material and so we have seized his possessions,” said Shah. A senior officer in the state police said this is a mischievous act by the cops concerned, because cash and the phone found on an allegedly drunk person cannot be treated as incriminating objects used in the crime. “If a person is found ferrying liquor or in possession of any alcoholic substance, only then can such articles belonging to him be seized. If a person is found to be drunk, it can never be ascertained that the phone or cash was used in the commission of the offence,” said the police officer. A city-based advocate, Jayendra Abhavekar, said, “There is no provision in the law where a person’s phone or money can be seized just because the person is found to be drunk.” It is not a case of gambling or betting where money can be seized, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/drunk-mans-phone-cash-officially-seized-by-cops/articleshow/85815101.cms||Ashish Chauhan

Dr Samiran Panda, senior scientist and head of the ICMR’s epidemiology and communicable diseases division, told TOI that state or district-specific epidemiological data will be used to feed into the simulator for state-specific projection of another wave, which could then be used for planning health resources and taking action. Dr Panda said that there is a need for each state to have access to the possible future Covid wave graphs, including the third wave. “For instance, the second wave had a different disease progression in different states, underlining the heterogeneous nature of the pandemic. Hence, a model that can project future surges specific to a smaller, local geographical area is required,” he said. He said that the timing of the second wave differed from state to state, which is why local projection is of importance. “Once the district or state authorities get to know of an upcoming surge, suitable micro-containment measures could be adopted, including action on prevention of spread of infection from a region, where the surge is expected, to other regions,” he said. The model was recently used to predict the severity of the third wave in India. It is called CHROMIC--Collaborative Health Research On Modelling by ICMR and Imperial College model. Dr Panda said that the simulator is based on a deterministic, compartmental model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/icmr-plans-to-give-states-covid-19-simulator-to-assess-their-readiness/articleshow/85815050.cms||Neha Madaan

The court was hearing the anticipatory bail plea of S Chithirai Sekar, a resident of Kanyakumari district who is apprehending arrest at the hands of the Kanyakumari cyber crime police. The case of the prosecution is that a woman while browsing through the internet came across a website stating that women would be provided government jobs. Believing this, the woman had sent her resume to a WhatsApp number and had also transferred nearly Rs 1 lakh. Since no steps were taken to provide her the job, she lodged a complaint before the police. In his petition, the petitioner stated that he is illiterate and has no knowledge of computers or about creating websites. The counsel for the petitioner submitted that the allegations against the petitioner are false. He further submitted that the petitioner is ready to cooperate with the investigation. Justice B Pugalendhi observed that since the petitioner has come forward to cooperate with the investigation, he is granted interim anticipatory bail for a period of two weeks, enabling him to appear before the police and to place all the materials in his favour before the investigating officer. The judge also directed the police officers to report the outcome of the investigation before this court on September 13.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/court-grants-interim-bail-to-man-in-job-cheating-case/articleshow/85815064.cms||---

Madurai district president K Ranjith Kumar said that it will be a boon for the lakhs of artists who are dependent on folk arts for a living. Pointing out at the ban on temple festivals to curtail the Covid-19 pandemic, the association urged the government to consider permitting temple festivals by adhering to the government guidelines. They said that their livelihood has been shattered without temples festivals due to the pandemic over the last two years. They also sought financial support from the government during the pandemic and free bus passes for folk artists bearing the government identity card. Stating that most of the artists are from the economically weaker sections of the society and are in rented houses, where they are struggling to pay rents, they urged the government to build houses for them. The houses can be built under the slum clearance board and we are even ready to repay it in affordable easy monthly instalments, Kumar said. They appealed to the government to consider their pleas and announce it in the budget session for the Tamil development, arts and culture budget session on September 4.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/artists-urge-state-govt-to-hold-temple-festivals-for-livelihood/articleshow/85815097.cms||---

The investigation has found that the gang had sold the synthetic drug to many persons in the state and had close links with interstate drug-peddling rackets. The call details of all the accused are being checked by the investigation team and more persons will be summoned based on it. Meanwhile, the five accused persons —Sreemon, Favas, Shabna, Ajmal and Afsal— were sent back in judicial custody as their custody period ended on Tuesday evening. Though the crime branch had plans to seek custody extension they did not file a petition as one of the accused turned Covid positive. All of them were produced before the judicial first class magistrate court via video conference and the court remanded them in judicial custody. The excise crime branch did not seek the custody of Thaiba, whose arrest was recorded much later. Sources said that excise crime branch has served notice to a few persons, mostly staff of certain resorts and homestays in Idukki and Wayanad, where the accused stayed recently. Though crime branch did not confirm it officially, they said more persons would be summoned soon. It is learnt that many in the city were customers for the MDMA brought by the gang from Chennai and Pondicherry. Preliminary findings suggest that the gang received help from many persons in the state. However, the officers are yet to identify the drug supplier who handed over the large quantity of MDMA to the gang. Sources said that excise might seek the support of narcotic cell in Tamil Nadu to get more details in the case. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/excise-to-quiz-more-people-in-mdma-case/articleshow/85815123.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||India||At Pranab memorial lecture, Vice President bats for ‘Mission 5,000’ to save parliamentary democracy||NEW DELHI: Pranab Mukherjee’s 50-year-long public life was the envy of every aspiring politician, Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu said as he delivered the first Pranab Mukherjee Memorial Lecture on the anniversary of the former President’s death. Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed Mukherjee as a “visionary and statesman” in a letter to his daughter Sharmistha as he recalled the ‘insightful counsel’ on policy matters he got from the former President. “More than the statistics about the long years of being in power, it was the contributions of Pranab da that made him unique in several ways. He deployed his sharp mind, phenomenal memory, deep understanding of our country’s diversity, history and civilisational values, and knowledge of statecraft to best use to various aspects of nation building,” Naidu said, referring to Mukherjee as “a path finder in troubled situations” and a “consensus builder”. He also expressed concern over rising disruptions in legislatures and the declining quality of India’s parliamentary democracy, calling for a people’s movement to influence the conduct of 5,000 MPs, MLAs and MLCs in law-making bodies. Calling it ‘Mission 5,000’, Naidu said such a campaign will save parliamentary democracy from losing its sheen. In its first edition, the memorial lecture also saw the virtual participation of former PM Manmohan Singh and a recorded message from Bangladesh premier Sheikh Hasina and Bhutanese King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck. “To all positions he occupied he brought his immense wisdom, deep knowledge, extensive experience of life and leadership skills spearheading critical decisions of the government on a wide range of issues,” Manmohan Singh said. Paying tribute to Mukherjee, Sheikh Hasina said, “He was a true friend of Bangladesh and a great political icon of the sub-continent. I pay my deep homage to the memory of this towering personality on his death anniversary…Pranab da had a deep love for Bangladesh. People of Bangladesh gratefully remember his support. Pranab Mukherjee had enormous respect and deep regards for our Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman," she said. Wangchuck said that while he cherishes the many meetings with Mukherjee, he feels the absence of the Indian leader's wisdom, wise counsel and support which he was fortunate to receive. “Shri Mukherjee contributed greatly in further strengthening the excellent relations between Bhutan and India. He had a long and close association with my father, the 4th King and they developed a close bond of friendship,” he said. In his letter to Mukherjee’s daughter, PM Modi said that as President of India, Mukherjee upheld the highest traditions, “further strengthening the democratic fabric of our nation” and said he was “blessed” to have always got the guidance and support of the former President. Virtually delivering the first ‘Pranab Mukherjee Memorial Lecture’ on ‘Constitutionalism; Guarantor of Democracy and Inclusive Growth’, organised by the ‘Pranab Mukherjee Legacy Foundation’, Naidu remembered Mukherjee fondly. “For both of us, India came first. When Pranab da became the first former President of India to address a RSS training camp at Nagpur, it was a profound statement of rising above the usual divide in the larger interest,” he said. Naidu said the Constitution of India is a profound statement of socio-economic objectives to be realised while pursuing the path of participatory democracy. He also said protests on the floor of legislative chambers are fine so long as they don’t breach the dignity and decorum of the House. “Protesting against the omissions and commissions of the governments on the floor of the legislatures is the right of the legislators. But the emotional underpinnings of such protests should not cross the limits of decency and decorum that should mark parliamentary democracy. To ensure this, I have been advocating that ‘Let the government propose, the opposition oppose and the House dispose’,” he said. He also said “dysfunctional legislatures” prevent wider consultations that should precede policy making and such actions negate the principle of accountability of the executive to legislatures, promoting arbitrariness, which Constitutionalism seeks to checkmate. Naidu also spoke on the country’s agenda for the next 25 years, stressing on inclusive developmental strategies and polity to eliminate what remains of poverty, illiteracy, gender discrimination and inequities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/at-pranab-memorial-lecture-vice-president-bats-for-mission-5000-to-save-parliamentary-democracy/articleshow/85820520.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Vaccine scam accused’s paramedical institute had no tie-up with govt body’||MUMBAI: A key accused in the fake vaccine scam, Dr Manish Tripathi, had enrolled students for National Council of Vocational and Research Training (NCVRT) courses at his institute for paramedical sciences despite not having an affiliation. A chargesheet filed by the Kandivali police in connection with the fraudulent vaccine drive at Hiranandani Heritage Society has a letter from NCVRT that confirms Tripathi's institute, KCEP Pvt Ltd., had been terminated and none of the students were registered for NCVRT courses. KCEP's website claims recognition by the Central Board of NCVRT besides several other universities and bodies. The chargesheet has attached KCEP's student records that show 22 students enrolled between 2020 and 2021 for NCVRT courses. An NCVRT state official told TOI that while Tripathi had initiated the process of affiliation, it was not completed. "The process is three months long and only after receiving a certificate of affiliation can an institute claim it has a tie-up with NCVRT. In fact, an inspection of KCEP's premises was proposed but Tripathi kept delaying it stating that he was out," the official said. The admission of every student must be registered with the government body, besides the affiliation, which wasn't done either. The chargesheet also contains statements of some of KCEP's students that were forced to join in for vaccination drives at Charkop's Shivam Hospital in March when it was a Private Covid Vaccination Centre (PCVC). The students have said they were given no formal training in administering shots. After working for a month, they were neither given certificates nor remunerated. "I wanted to graduate in science with a Nursing Council certificate and enrolled at KCEP earlier this year, paying Rs 1.15 lakh. Classes were held online. Then in March, Tripathi called seven of us to KCEP's centre adjacent to Shivam Hospital. He took us around the hospital to show how it functioned and gave a demonstration of jabs by injecting one of our classmates, Karim Ali, with distilled water. But we were not given any practice in administering shots ourselves. I gave shots to 150 beneficiaries in March but despite being promised Rs 3000, I got nothing," a student said. Another student told the police that while a 0.5ml vaccine dose is administered universally, Tripathi had asked her to give shots of 0.3ml so that more people could be jabbed. "Some beneficiaries were unable to generate certificates and created a ruckus in the hospital in March. Tripathi would give them a stamped certificate on the hospital's letterhead, bearing his signature, to placate them," she said. Both Ali and Tripathi have been arrested in the scam along with nine others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-vaccine-scam-accuseds-paramedical-institute-had-no-tie-up-with-govt-body/articleshow/85818869.cms||Nitasha Natu

---||Pune||Pune: 10 new oxygen plants to be functional in civic health facilities by month-end||PUNE: Civic hospitals across Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad will have 10 new oxygen generation plants by September 30, strengthening the oxygen availability, in view of the possible third wave of the pandemic. At present, 26 such plants are already functional with the combined capacity of 28 metric tonne oxygen generation across the civic hospitals in the district. Of these, 13 are in Pune rural, 10 are in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits, and three are in the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) limits. With the addition of 10 new plants, the capacity will increase to 50 metric tonne. The total target of the district administration is to increase the capacity to 74 metric tonne by installing 62 such plants across the civic hospitals by year-end. Ayush Prasad, the Pune ZP CEO, said, “We have planned to install 38 oxygen generation plants across the rural parts of the district. Of them, 13 are functional, while the remaining are in the pipeline. With the help of initiatives, we have managed to equip our hospital beds with the oxygen support.” Prasad said the zilla parishad was not only focussing on the oxygen generation plants, but they were also looking into increasing the dura cylinders, the jumbo oxygen cylinders and the storage tanks for the liquid oxygen. Oxygen usage has gone down drastically in the district, as the demand has fallen to just around 125 metric tonne per day, which had reached 363 metric tonne per day in April. Apart from the oxygen generation plants, the Pune district’s 19 government-run hospitals have as many as 339 metric tonne functional liquid oxygen storage capacity according to the district health office’s report. It further stated that the capacity is around 256 metric tonne in 20 private hospitals in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/10-new-o2-plants-to-be-functional-in-civic-health-facilities-by-month-end/articleshow/85815119.cms||Piyush Bhusari

Instead, some mandals engaged in charity work to help the needy in the prevailing environment. Prakash Raut from Shivtej Group in Kasba Peth said, “We wanted to organise Dahi Handi with children from an orphanage to come and make the human pyramid and break the pot, but we were told by the police not to organise events to avoid rise in cases. The youngsters (govindas) who form the human pyramid are disappointed as they did not get to perform this year too.” Expressing his disappointment, Chetan Deokar, a govinda, said, “With the easing of restrictions, mandals could have also been given permission to organise the event on a small scale while following the precautions, but we weren’t. The gap of two years is a big deal for govindas. We are keeping our fingers crossed to be able to return to organising festivities next year.” Satish Shinde, advisor, Bhairavnath Talim Mandal, Kondhwa, said, “Youngsters are most upset about not getting to participate in Dahi Handi festivities. Human life is more important than celebrations and we need to strictly follow all Covid-19 protocols to get rid of the pandemic.” Some mandals have found an alternative way to celebrate the festival by participating in charity work. Sachin Jamage, president, Yuva Pheonix Society, Vande Mataram Sanghatna, Sinhagad Road, said, “We organised a private event with 20 people on Monday, after which we donated books for children in naxal-hit areas of Gadchiroli. The tradition of forming a human pyramid was carried out by only eight govindas, but there was no dhol tasha. On Tuesday, we organised a similar small-scale Dahi Handi event in Jejuri.” Deputy commissioner of police (Zone I) Priyanka Narnaware said, “The Dahi Handi mandals adhered to the guidelines of the state government and none of them or any other group of people defied the orders. Police teams were patrolling the old part of the city but people did not organize the Dahi Handi events.” The TOI team on Tuesday visited several parts of the old city and Satara Road but did not find any Dahi Handi events taking place.

The church remained closed since August last year after the district collector took possession of it following a court order. The handing-over process began by around 5:30am and was completed in 30minutes. Along with Kottayam tahsildar, priests and a few laity of Orthodox Church, totalling to 10, entered the church and held prayers. While the Orthodox Church said that it was the implementation of the court order, the Jacobite faction said that the guidelines put forward by the court were not implemented. Thomas Mor Alexandrios, metropolitan of Mumbai diocese, of the Jacobite Church, was taken into custody by police as he arrived at the church, and was shifted to a nearby school. He later sat on the roadside and staged a protest alleging that the administration did not follow the guidelines of the court while implementing the order. He also said that he should have been arrested if the administration had been following court guidelines. There was a heavy deployment of police forces at the church and its premises. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/thiruvarppu-church-keys-handed-over-to-orthodox-faction/articleshow/85815172.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat government to add 500 oxygen plants||AHMEDABAD: As part of its preparedness for the projected third wave of Covid-19 infections, the state government is all set to add at least 500 pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen plants to augment the existing oxygen producing capacity in the state. This will take the total number of oxygen plants to 553 across Gujarat. “At least 300 of these plants have already been installed and the work for the remaining ones is in progress. Over the next month and half, the remaining plants will be set up,” said state health secretary, Jaiprakash Shivahare. Earlier, the state had plans for manufacturing some 350 new PSA oxygen plants, which has now been ramped up to 500. “With the new plants being set up, the total oxygen manufacturing capability in the state will go up to 1,800MT in the state,” Shivahare further added. While the new PSA plants will have a 400MT capacity, the existing liquid oxygen manufacturing capability will also be augmented with an additional 400MT capacity. Ensuring timely and adequate oxygen supply was one of the key challenges during the second wave of Covid-19 infections as the daily requirement of oxygen grew nearly seven folds in a matter of 20 days in April. Gujarat currently has an oxygen manufacturing capacity of at least 1,000MT, according to state government sources. A majority of this is diverted towards industrial consumption. In routine times, the medical consumption of oxygen is barely 50MT in a day. The new plants that are being commissioned include 392 being set up by the government and the remaining by private sector. During the second wave of Covid-19 infections, the peak per day oxygen requirement was 1,173MT. “Such a high capacity is needed only at the time when cases have peaked. Based on projections, we will make the necessary capacity available which will be readied by mid-October,” said a well-placed source in the state government.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/guj-to-add-500-oxygen-plants/articleshow/85815158.cms||Niyati Parikh

The court made some serious observations during the hearing of suo moto contempt petitions against IAS officers for not implementing the court’s orders with regard to removal of Raithu Bharosa Kendras (RBKs), and village and ward secretariats from school premises. It had earlier summoned education, panchayat raj and municipal administration department officials for personal appearance in the suo moto contempt case. Panchayat raj principal secretary Gopala Krishna Dwivedi, commissioner Girija Shankar, school education principal secretary B Rajasekhar, commissioner V Chinaveerabhadrudu, municipal administration principal secretary J Shyamala Rao, director MM Naik, and former director G Vijay Kumar appeared before the court on Tuesday. Special chief secretary for municipal administration, Y Srilakshmi, sought exemption from appearance citing personal reasons. The court posed several questions over the opening of schools without completing the vaccination drive. Justice Battu Devanand asked officials if they would take responsibility if something happened to any student. Vaccinating teachers would not be sufficient without giving vaccines to parents and students, he said, adding that this was a classic case of officials being disconnected from the ground realities. He said the decision to open schools did not appear to be taken in public interest. The officials considered it as a prestige issue and ignored the well-being of students, he observed. When the courts are still functioning in virtual mode, how could the government decide to open schools, asked Justice Devanand. Education department officials told the high court that they have identified 1,160 structures that include either RBKs or secretariats in the premises of schools, out of which 450 have been removed. They said the remaining offices would be removed very soon and necessary orders have been issued. The court posted further hearing of the matter to October 1.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/high-court-pulls-up-govt-for-reopening-schools-before-completing-vax-drive/articleshow/85815176.cms||Srikanth Aluri

The strike was launched jointly by the trade unions INTUC, CITU, TUCI, BMS, STU and STDU representing the workers in the Harrison Malayalam estate and Joonktollee (Cochin Malabar) estate. The tribespeople in the area have also voiced strong protests against the alleged indifferent attitude of the authorities even when people are getting killed by wild animals straying into human habitations. Congress launched a series of protest marches at different locations in the area. Already four people have lost their lives in the attacks by wild elephants this year at Palappilli and Kundayi areas . Meanwhile, a meeting of various stakeholders, including representatives of the various departments like forest, revenue, local self government, police and tribal welfare and leaders of the trade unions and political parties, was held on Tuesday to discuss measures to contain the man-animal conflict in the area. There was a general consensus at the meeting to step up patrolling in the area by the elephant driving squad. The estate-running companies have been asked to initiate measures like view line clearing, building up trenches, and strengthening fencing. The workers have been asked to avoid going to work in the dark hours and start off work after 6am.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/protest-against-lapses-in-containing-man-animal-conflict/articleshow/85815237.cms||T Ramavarman

We cannot leave these issues unattended when we are talking about saving electricity and living a sustainable life. Although no one responded to the problem earlier, it was resolved soon after it was published in the newspaper,” said Hafez Mohammed Hussain, the citizen reporter who highlighted the issue. However, the residents were informed there are several other streets in the area where there is a similar problem. “We are really glad that the issue of streetlights in Bazaarghat has been resolved. I request the authorities to conduct regular inspections in other areas in Mallepally and see that the streetlights are switched on immediately after sunset and switched off in the morning,” said Sameera Begum, a resident of Mallepally. When contacted, GHMC assistant engineer S Karunakar said, “There must have been some issue with the auto control of the lights, but it has been sorted now.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/streetlights-in-mallepally-finally-fixed/articleshow/85817491.cms||---

Pointing out at the important discoveries in this phase, he expressed concern that officials from the state archaeology department are planning to conclude it in the first half of September. Clay tiles with names such as Aadhan and Uthiran have been found while earthen pots with 13 letters have also been found in this phase. These could prove that Tamils have a history dating back to 2,600 to 3,000 years and that they were literate, he said. Stating that five big red pots standing 60cm in height and with a diameter of 34 and 24cm were excavated recently, apart from gold earrings, stone farming articles, metal weapons and well, he said that the excavation should continue at the place to unearth more artefacts that are of historical significance. He also demanded the release of the report on the findings in the first six phases of excavation that were carried out from 2015. So far, only the report of the 4th phase has been published. “The report of the first three phases and the fifth and sixth phases should be immediately published by the central and state governments,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/ramadoss-urges-govt-to-extend-7th-phase-excavation/articleshow/85815211.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Road crashes high even with curbs, laments CM Uddhav Thackeray||MUMBAI: CM Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday said that despite Covid-19 travel restrictions, road crashes in the state did not come down drastically in 2020 and fatalities were almost as high as in 2019. Launching 76 new interceptor vehicles for the RTO flying squads, he said the objective was not to keep catching more offenders but to act as a “deterrent”. He hoped that this way the number of road fatalities would be brought down significantly. As many as 24,971 road accidents were reported in 2020 that left 11,569 people dead despite the lockdown restrictions on movement. In comparison, there were 32,925 crashes that had led to 12,788 deaths in 2019, said police sources. “We have witnessed several incidents of rash and negligent driving on our roads — both in the city, and state and national highways. People speed and the car rolls across the divider and hits other vehicles, resulting in more casualties. This should stop and we need to save lives,” Thackeray said. He said the flying squads were now equipped with the best gadgets in the country and they were entrusted with the responsibility of ensuring road safety and curbing mishaps. Each interceptor vehicle has been equipped with speed guns, tint meters and breathalysers. The speed guns will enable the enforcement officers to track a speeding vehicle from a distance and intercept any car or heavy vehicle for breaching the speed limit. “It will also be equipped with tint meters, which can detect the transparency of the windscreen and window panes of a vehicle. If we find that a vehicle violates the rules, we will impound it and penalise the car owner,” deputy commissioner (enforcement) Abhay Deshpande said. The interceptors, procured at a cost of Rs 13.7 crore, will also have breathalysers to help detect drunk drivers. An official said that the new speed guns are modern and have higher accuracy. “RTO officials have a shortage of equipment and these vehicles will be well-equipped. In the first phase, 76 interceptor vehicles are being provided and 16 more will be procured shortly,” he said. There are 92 flying squads with various RTOs in the state. “Just like preventing deaths due to Covid-19, the state is also concerned about reducing fatalities on the highways. With the vehicle population across the state soon reaching the four crore mark, it is high time we make our roads safer for motorists,” Thackeray said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-road-crashes-high-even-with-curbs-laments-cm/articleshow/85817603.cms||Somit Sen
---||Madurai||Madurai: Schools unlikely to operate idling buses due to lack of maintenance||MADURAI: Vans and buses belonging to the private schools here are unlikely to operate due to chances of the vehicles developing technical snag, as they have been lying idle for a long time. These vehicles operated by institutions have been stopped for more than 17 months since closure of schools was announced in the third week of March last year during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. The transport department inspects the vehicles along with the police, revenue and education department officials on 32 different safety parameters ahead of the reopening of schools every year. These vehicles have not been inspected in May 2020 and May 2021 due to closure of schools. Education institutions in Madurai operate 1,128 vans and buses. This includes 879 that are operated by schools under the three RTO offices in the district – Madurai North (354), Central (256) and South (269). The remaining 249 vehicles are operated by colleges and other higher education institutions. A senior RTO official told TOI that this year they are yet to receive the circular from the transport commissioner to conduct the checks. “However, we prepared the list of vehicles that are operated by institutions to checktheir preparedness. But most of them said they would not be operating as it would not be viable immediately and that they would wait and watch before taking a call,” he said. Senthilnathan M, president of the private schools correspondents’ confederation said that most schools are not prepared to run school buses as of now. “There is no problem preparing old vehicles that already have fitness certificate, but for new vehicles it will be difficult.  Further, even without any maintenance, just insurance cost us around Rs 75,000 to Rs 1 lakh without covering vehicle damage,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/schools-unlikely-to-operate-idling-buses-due-to-lack-of-maintenance/articleshow/85815236.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Banners Fly In The Face Of Directives||Hyderabad: Notwithstanding the strict ban and directives from the civic authorities, unauthorised banners, flexis, neon signboards and hoardings can be found all across the city. A drive through the city, especially during political rallies, festivals and other events, reveal that despite the directorate of Enforcement Vigilance and Disaster Management (EVDM) wing of the GHMC imposing fines, several such advertisements that not only challenge the aesthetic appeal of the area but also pose accident risk to commuters and pedestrians continue to dot the city. Several flex banners, neon lights and hoardings were spotted at Ameerpet, Narayanguda, Kukatpally, Moosapet, Miyapur, Himayathnagar, Malakpet, Abids, Secunderabad, Nallakunta, L B Nagar, Nagole and several other parts of Old City. According to the GHMC, there are over 2700 hoardings and over 300 unipoles in the city. Types of Violations Unipoles: Even as the authorities have been successful in implementing the ban of advertisements on unipoles across the city, experts said that the iron structures will be weakened over the years. “These massive iron structures might rust and lose structural stability over a period of time if left unattended. But the problem arises only when people flout rules and install hoardings heavier than prescribed dimensions. These things need must be looked at very carefully,” said SP Anchuri, vice-president, Structural Engineers World Congress Banners/Hoardings: Despite special drives to pull them down, most of these hoardings are installed adjacent to busy roads and have the potential not only to cause severe damage to private and public property but pose serious threat to the lives of commuters. “Advertisement agencies take permission to erect hoardings measuring 40 x 20 square feet, but instead extend this to more than 70 square feet when they are installing them. Authorities must ensure the measurements don’t change on ground,” said Suresh Kumar, civil engineer Central dividers/ Lollipop advertisement boards: In several areas, advertisements on central dividers are installed very low to the ground, at three or four feet, and block the vision of motorists. Experts pointed out that such hoardings pose an accident risk, especially at turnings. “The width of hoardings should be installed above the eye-level of the commuter and they should be less than the width of the central median,” said SP Anchuri, vice-president Neon & glow signs boards: Excessive use of sign boards can sometimes distract motorists and cause accidents. Road safety experts said that repeated violations, despite fines, are a cause for concern. “At times, getting distracted for just a second can cause a major accident on city roads. These lights can often effectively distract the attention of drivers and can put their life in risk. They also obstruct the view of the drivers of the fast-moving vehicles and are always dangerous for the public,” said road safety expert Vinod Kumar Kanumala. What does the rulebook say As per the norms of Municipal Administration and Urban Development’s GO 68, the city is not permitted to have any advertising structure that serves no purpose or utility. In case an ad agency is interested to erect ads, it can only be done if they provide citizens with some amenity which complies with GHMC standards, such as by constructing public toilets or bus shelters with some advertising space, as permitted by the GHMC Penalties imposed - In September 2020, a school was fined Rs 1 lakh for erecting a banner on a pavement in the city in violation of the rules. The fine came after an activist took to Twitter and attached two photos showing the encroachment - In February this year, EVDM wing slapped a fine of Rs 1.15 lakh on a businessman for allegedly erecting unauthorised hoardings and uni-poles at Jubilee Hills and Himayatnagar. The advertisement erected by the businessman to congratulate newly-elected GHMC mayor Gadwal Vijayalakshmi was unauthorised - In July, a politician fined Rs 10 lakh for defacing the city with banners, flags, and hoardings showing himself with the chief minister, around the localities of Jubilee Hills, Banjara Hills, Gachibowli, Kachiguda, Kondapur among others - In August, a penalty of Rs 80,000 was imposed on a political functionary for raising unauthorised banners and advertisement elements in Ramanthapur ward. The issue was brought to the notice of EVDM’s central enforcement cell through Twitter following which the penalty was imposed Incidents and accidents - A gust of heavy wind brought down a 15-ton unipole hoarding upon an ice cream parlour opposite KBR Park, killing one person and injuring four in April 2007 - A hoarding set up by GHMC for the Metropolis World Congress crashed on two bikes on Raheja circle-Old Bombay highway stretch causing death of one housekeeping executive and two injured in October 2014 - A giant hoarding at Jubliee Hills checkpost broke and fell on cars parked in front of Maruti Suzuki’s Nexa showroom in May 2016 - A hoarding which was erected on the terrace of a house, which was visible from PVNR expressway, falls due to strong winds in May 2016 - A couple travelling on a bike at Rampally X roads suffered injuries after a hoarding of a political leader fell on them due to heavy rain in July 2021. This incident was caught on camera. The police rushed to the couple and shifted them to a nearby private hospital Only 2,600 in city hoardings legal: GHMC in RTI According to Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), only 2600 hoardings are legal and the rest of them have been installed illegally. In reply to an RTI query, the GHMC said that it has earned revenue of 97.42 crore during April 2016 to December 2020. The RTI was filed by a member of YouRTI.in and social activist Karim Ansari. The GHMC said it had collected revenues of Rs 80.18 crore from hoardings and unipoles. It also said that it earned Rs 26.26 crores from hoardings in 2017-18, its highest earning, followed by Rs 20.68 crores in 2018-19, Rs 18.44 crore in 2019-20, and Rs 14.80 crore in 2016-17. In the last five years the urban local body has earned Rs 17.34 crore from neon and glow signboards. In 2019-20 it earned around Rs 4.33 crores, the highest revenue, followed by Rs 4.26 crores in 2016-17, Rs 4.19 crores in 2018-19, and Rs 4.01 crores in 2017-18. However in 2020-21, GHMC earned only Rs 0.43 crore from neon and glow signboard advertising while no revenue was earned from hoardings during this period. This comes after the government issued an order in April 2020 saying rooftop hoardings and any advertisement structures above 15ft from ground level would not be permitted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/banners-fly-in-the-face-of-directives/articleshow/85817517.cms||---

If the BJP was serious about protecting cows, they should have banned beef across the country but they have chosen to bring cow slaughter act in selected states,” he said. “While it imposed beef ban in Karnataka and MP, they have not imposed it in Goa, & north-east states where they have their governments,” Owaisi told TOI on the side-lines of his campaign for HDMC polls. “What will happen to families who depend on the beef business? There are many stunted and nourished poor children,” he added. “The farmers' protest in Delhi is going on in the proper way. The farm laws passed by the Union government are unconstitutional, and against the federal system as farming is a state issue. That's why the whole country is protesting against the Modi government,” he added. Will contest assembly polls in 2023 Speaking over the plan to strengthen his party in Karnataka, he said contesting local body elections will strengthen the party at the local level. “We also plan to contest the forthcoming assembly elections in 2023 and preparations have already begun,” he added. “It's not an appropriate time to tell the constituencies and the number of constituencies from where the party intends to contest. They will be announced later,” said Owaisi. AIMIM is currently focusing on local body elections and will later look at assembly and Lok Sabha elections. “It is too premature to react on the plans for the parliamentary elections. First, we will prepare for assembly elections,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/beef-ban-only-to-target-minorities-owaisi/articleshow/85812877.cms||J Abbas Mulla
---||Hyderabad||Readers corner||I learnt the importance of saying 'no' By Keshav Bang The COVID-19 pandemic has taken a toll on mental health of people at large. In these difficult times, I prioritised myself over other people. Over the years, I have been a "people pleaser", and always went out of my way to help others. However, the pandemic taught me to prioritise my mental health. You can’t make everyone happy, but you can surely make yourself content. So, I started doing things I love, and refused everything that I didn’t like. I started saying no to people, a thing I couldn’t do before the pandemic. I started working out, which was good for both my physical and mental health. I kept myself busy so that I didn’t have time to think about anything else. I started learning new skills and did internships. While the pandemic was troublesome, it made me learn several things. It took me away from my college and hostel life, but brought me closer to my school friends. Traveling is one of my favorite things. So, we went on road trips, treks and explored many unknown places whenever it was possible. I started playing the piano, which I had stopped in school because of my studies. I did activities that made me happy and thought little about other people, including my family. When you are happy, you spread your happiness and your positive vibes to people around you. So, stay happy and stay safe. (The writer is an engineering 3rd year student) …...................... Now, I complain less, criticise less and condemn less By Avlokita Sharma When the pandemic began in March 2020, I had never comprehended the stress that would affect my psychological, emotional and physical well-being. The big change I embraced was self-actualization. Now, I emphasise more on mental health. It’s high time we stopped glamourising multi-tasking and overworking. I began practising mindfulness, writing positive affirmations and pasting them on my work desk. I blocked people who spread pessimism, and understood what mattered the most. The change helped me de-clutter my mind. Now, I complain less, criticise less and condemn less. I am more appreciative and compassionate. Another change that I brought about in my life was practising minimalism. I have embraced the triad of simplicity, sustainability and sensibility. Having switched to modest choices, my needs are now limited. It was a conscious choice to live with freedom from passion to possess, hoard and waste. I now recycle and donate. The pantry these days boasts of locally sourced, fresh veggies and seasonal fruits. The trips to supermarket have gone down, and processed food items are vanishing from our menu. The Covid-19 pandemic presented as an opportunity to instil values of self-reliance in my family members. Now, a sudden request for leave by my house help or cook does not make me anxious. All four of us (self, spouse and two teenage children) are now adept at cooking, scrubbing, cleaning, washing, gardening and organising. The pandemic will be over soon, but the changes I have incorporated are here to stay. I now often find myself with this Rumi quote: Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I want to change myself. (The writer works as a school counsellor)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/readers-corner/articleshow/85817575.cms||---

The book aims at helping children face post-pandemic school reopening with a positive mindset. Amid the pandemic, CEDAR has been delivering several programmes and handholding support to children from ten rural communities and four slums in Madurai to protect their mental wellbeing. “We have developed at least two self-learning manuals using alternative pedagogical methods involving storytelling, creative writing, theatre, drawing and painting, folk art etc. The 90-page second manual ‘Let us Face Corona: Children’s Art Manual for Action’ has been developed with the specific purpose of helping children,” said Dr Chinnaraj Joseph Jaikumar, managing trustee, CEDAR. The first children’s art manual was released in June 2020 and brought very positive results of coping among children, he said. The manual provides scientific and rational understanding of the dynamics of Covid-19, followed by problem-solving exercises. “Children are helped to internalise ‘Covid Appropriate Behaviour.’ Several of the ‘do it yourself’ activities are designed to make them active agents in creating awareness, parents and public at large,” said Dr Chinnaraj. He further said that 500 copies of the art manual will be supplied free to children in their project area who have little or no access to digital platforms.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/art-manual-to-help-cope-with-school-reopening/articleshow/85815276.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||Railways shifting to solar power could cut emissions: Study||Nagpur: Direct supply of solar energy to Indian Railway lines, without the need to connect through the grid, would save almost 7 million tonnes of carbon a year while also powering at least one in four trains on the national network on competitive terms. This was revealed in a new study by NGO Climate Trends and UK-based green tech start-up Riding Sunbeams. According to the annual report of Indian railways 2019-2020, there was a passenger traffic of over 8 billion in that period, which would mean that 2 billion passengers could be travelling on trains directly powered by solar energy. The new analysis highlights that around a quarter of this new solar capacity — up to 5,272 megawatt — could be fed directly into the railway’s overhead lines instead of being procured over the electricity networks, reducing energy losses and saving money for the rail operator. The researchers found that substituting energy supplied from the coal-dominated grid for private-wire supply from solar could also rapidly cut emissions by as much as 6.8million tonnes carbon dioxide each year — just over the entire annual emissions of Kanpur. Stating that India is leading on rail electrification and solar power deployment, report co-author and founder of Riding Sunbeams Leo Murray said, “Our analysis shows that connecting these two keystone low-carbon technologies together in Indian Railways can drive both the country’s economic recovery from the Covid pandemic and its efforts to transition off fossil fuels to tackle the climate crisis.” Highlighting that the government pumps large sums of money to modernise the railways, director of Climate Trends and co-author Aarti Khosla said, “There has been analysis that converting all diesel locomotives to electric will indeed increase the emissions in the short term, however, this report shows the tremendous opportunity of doing it right the first time, by creating a direct connection of the locomotive system to solar PV installations, meeting more than a quarter of the total demand.” The researchers also warned, however, that achieving the target of full electrification of all routes by 2023 could be accompanied by an increase in CO2 emissions in the short term because of India’s current reliance on coal to produce electricity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/railways-shifting-to-solar-power-could-cut-emissions-study/articleshow/85817569.cms||Manka Behl

Hearing a batch of petitions, include several PILs and suo moto pleas, the HC bench headed by Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice Ninala Jayasurya asked the government about the status of vaccination programme in the state. The government, which filed an affidavit, stated that over 90 per cent people above the age of 45 have been vaccinated in the state. The vaccination drive is continuing in full capacity and the focus is to provide Covid vaccines to all citizens above the age of 18. The government further stated that it has been using all resources at its disposal to ensure optimum success of the vaccination drive. If the Union government supplies enough doses, the government is prepared to complete the vaccination drive in the next two months, it said in the affidavit. The high court also enquired about the higher number of cases being reported in East Godavari and Chittoor districts, and the measures being taken in these districts to contain the spread of the virus. The bench suggested to quickly identify and isolate the hotspots in the districts where higher number of cases are being reported. Directing the government to file a fresh status report, the court posted the matters for further hearing to September 8.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/hc-seeks-report-on-preventive-steps/articleshow/85815257.cms||---
---||Kochi||Taliban knew a lot about Bollywood, says Kerala-born American doctor||Even as the last US troops left Afghanistan on Tuesday, a Kerala-born American doctor who was held hostage by the Taliban in 2012, recalled how some of his captors defied the die-hard cavemen stereotype and, like youngsters everywhere, were fond of music and movies and were fans of Bollywood stars. Dr Dilip Joseph, a US citizen originally from Changanassery, was taken hostage by the Taliban on December 5, 2012 while he was conducting primary health and preventive medicine training among rural medical staff engaged by an American NGO. Incidentally, he was rescued on the fourth night by the elite Navy SEAL Team Six, the unit that killed Osama bin Laden. Dr Dilip Joseph (in grey dress) shares a meal with Afghan village eldersSpeaking to TOI, Joseph said he wanted to go back to Afghanistan as Afghans are some of the best people one will ever interact in the world. “I tried to go back twice between 2013 and 14 but didn't get a visa. I still hope to go back at some point,” he said. Joseph was taken hostage on his 10th visit to the country. "On the way to a rural community health clinic, we were coming down a mountainous road -- with my Afghan colleague and our driver -- when we saw a gunman pop out from the side of a bush on the road. As soon as we were stopped, we were surrounded by three more, both from the front and back of the vehicle," he recalled. It was then a nine-hour walk to the mountains, where he was kept in captivity for four days. “On the second day, they made it known that they were looking for a ransom. It was not until the third evening that the amount was mentioned," he said. “Though they had a few negative things to say about Americans initially, they also realized that they could possibly raise the ransom for an American hostage.” The negotiations for his release eventually broke down, and by the fourth day, the kidnappers decided to split up the group. Joseph recollected his interaction with a 19-year-old boy among his captors who left a lasting impression on him. "I ended up having a very meaningful, deep conversation for almost three hours with this boy. He opened up quite a bit about his life after asking a lot of questions about mine. This conversation made me realize how similar we all are irrespective of our differences, whether it be in culture, religion, traditions, etc," he said. He also realised that Taliban men "knew a lot about Bollywood movies and actors. It was surprising to me since the Taliban tends to be very much against music and movies," he said. On the fourth night, while Joseph was being held in a small, pitch-black room, a man burst through his door. "It was a Navy SEAL who was part of the rescue operation. The Seal Team Six member was hit in Taliban gunfire. Other members soon came and one of them just fell on top of me to protect me from firing," he remembered. Joseph realised that he was rescued by Navy SEAL only when he was brought to the American military base. He also came to know that the 19-year-old boy was among those killed in the operation. He has penned his experiences in a book, 'Kidnapped by the Taliban’, published in 2014. Joseph is keenly watching the developments in Afghanistan now. “The present Taliban leadership seems to be speaking a slightly different narrative. We will have to wait and see whether the vision that they have is anything different from the late '90s. Given that the country has developed so much over the past nearly two decades, I hope the people can also leave their fear and show their true character -- strength, wisdom, vitality -- in order to blend better with the purity message that the Taliban seem to care most about within their society,” he said. Joseph is now working on a part-time basis with the same NGO that works among Afghans. He is also a healthcare strategist for various communities around the world with another NGO. He had moved to the US in 1989 from Changanassery in Kottayam. “My father was doing his doctoral studies at Fuller theological seminary in Pasadena, California. The family also decided to move with him as it was a five-year course. I have very fond memories of Changanassery. I attended Sacred Heart School there from Grade II to X. I still keep contact with some friends there," Joseph said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/taliban-knew-a-lot-about-bwood/articleshow/85815281.cms||Jaikrishnan Nair
---||Ahmedabad||How to test if green labelled package is pure veg? HC seeks govt reply||Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court on Tuesday expressed dissatisfaction at the unavailability of a facility to test if food bought from the market is proper vegetarian food and sought “comprehensive and detailed” answers from the state government and the Centre over the rules for applying symbols and colour codes for packaged food to know if a green labelled product is pure vegetarian food. The HC sought affidavits on a “more serious question” — whether the state and its agencies or laboratories have adequate infrastructure and wherewithal to undertake all relevant Food Safety Standard tests and then certify that products with the ‘Green label’, believed to have no non-veg element or content, include eggs and egg flakes from any animal source. The petitioner, Mumbai Jivdaya Mandali, has been asserting that the government has not mentioned any facility to ascertain whether the ‘green dot’ on a food packet is perfect. Criteria have not been fixed as to how to test food items. Its advocate, N M Kapadia, submitted that the Supreme Court and the Delhi high court have said that a person has a right to know whether a product is vegetarian or non-vegetarian food. It is a constitutional right of every citizen to know and to protect his religious rights. There is no facility in Gujarat to verify the green label on a food package. At the HC’s query, the government counsel submitted that he would have to get instructions about the full facilities available for analysis of food products, with the approved laboratories for ingredients as well as additives. The PIL demands implementation of provisions of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 and Food Safety and Standards (Packaging and Labelling) Regulations, 2011, to ascertain whether any green labelled food item contains any non-vegetarian ingredient. It seeks HC directions to the government to “act urgently and periodically by obtaining samples of food items from the open market, and doing inspections periodically at regular intervals and to carry out tests”.

The Kushinagar MLA met patients at the Firozabad medical college. Taking cognizance of problems faced by caretakers of the patients in arranging for blood and platelets, the Congress leader donated blood at the government hospital. He also directed the Congress workers to donate blood and help patients at home in getting medicines and required treatment. Lallu blamed the Yogi government for recent deaths in the district. He demanded Rs 10 lakh compensation for family members of patients who died suffering mysterious viral fever and dengue-like symptoms. The Congress state president said, “The chief minister is more concerned about elections as compared to people dying due to lack of proper treatment. The state government makes tall claims on hoardings, but on the ground, they have failed the common people. We are in support of the patients suffering due to the negligence of the state government. I have directed Congress workers to donate blood and help patients in getting treatment. We want the chief minister to provide Rs 10 lakh compensation each to the family members of patients who lost their lives suffering illness.” Meanwhile, five more deaths were reported in Firozabad district in the last 24 hours, increasing the district tally to 55.

She started chatting with him through video calls. A year later, the accused, Vishnu Sahani (26), managed to convince the minor to get “bolder” during a video call. The victim later came to know that the youth had made and circulated her obscene video among her friends and even a couple of teachers, who were there in a common WhatsApp group. The youth also started blackmailing the minor. Realizing that she had been trapped, the girl finally informed her parents about the matter and they lodged an FIR with the Burrabazar police station. Cops have arrested Sahani from Rishikesh in Uttarakhand and brought him back to Kolkata on transit remand. “In 2019, the victim had first received a friend request from the accused, who introduced himself as Rahul Singh on Facebook and she accepted the request. The accused, later identified as Sahani, managed to collect the WhatsApp number of the victim through Facebook messenger. Thereafter, he deleted his Facebook account to remove all traces and took to WhatsApp to keep in touch with the victim,” said a police officer. As time passed, the girl believed that their friendship was now a long-distance relationship, said an investigating officer. “She started making WhatsApp video calls without the knowledge of her parents. In 2020, the accused finally trapped the girl and lured her into disrobing over a WhatsApp video call. At that moment, the accused captured the nude pictures of the victim on his mobile. Later, he started blackmailing the minor. Finally on July 28, the girl told her family about the matter. Her school counsellors, too, asked her to approach the police,” the officer added. The police registered a case under IPC sections pertaining to stalking and insulting the modesty of a woman under the IPC, read with sections 12 and 14 of POCSO of Act, 2012, against the accused. “Once it was established that the accused was Vishnu Sahani (26), a resident of Dayanand Marg at Chandreshwar Nagar in Uttarakhand, we dispatched a team from Kolkata. A raid was conducted with the help of the cops from Rishikesh police station and the accused was arrested from his residence. The mobile that was used to commit the crime has been seized. Sahani was brought to Kolkata on transit remand and produced before the POCSO Court,” said joint CP (crime), Murlidhar Sharma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/online-friend-stalks-blackmails-city-student-held-from-rishikesh/articleshow/85815331.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Ahmedabad||HC critical of IIM-Ahmedabad’s behaviour with ex-faculty member||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Tuesday seemed upset with the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad (IIM-A) and termed its dealings with a former associate professor “pathetic”, as the faculty member left the institute by putting in his papers he was issued a show-cause notice for alleged financial irregularities. The petition was filed by the former faculty member, Manish Aggarwal, who was on probation until last year. The institute issued him a show-cause notice on March 26, 2020, for alleged financial irregularities, stating that he was claiming more than actual expenditure incurred during foreign tours. Aggarwal resigned the very next day and refused to participate in the inquiry, saying it was not maintainable at all. The institute accepted the resignation on certain conditions, including the outcome of the inquiry. After the inquiry, Aggarwal was found guilty of charge of financial irregularities and IIM-A slapped a penalty on him, 400% of the alleged loss he caused to the institute. Aggarwal moved the HC challenging the inquiry as well as the penalty, claiming that he was not heard on this matter and a decision was wrongly taken against him, which is not sustainable. During the hearing, Justice Bhargav Karia asked why IIM-A was in such a hurry that it decided to conduct the inquiry during corona times. “What was so urgent? Could you not give him time? Why such a draconian action or removal?...You could have waited till the situation was normalised. What was the hurry?” the judge asked. The court went ahead and said, “You can give him a full-fledged hearing. An institute of the level of IIM behaving in such a manner is pathetic. The future of business of India is in your hands, and you are behaving in such a manner… This is not done.” Appearing for IIM-A, advocate Nandish Chudgar explained to the court that Aggarwal had immediately resigned as soon as the show-cause notice was issued and the inquiry was to be instituted. To the court’s queries, the lawyer submitted that Aggarwal was asked thrice in April 2020 to appear before the inquiry committee online and argue his case, but he chose not to appear and instead claimed that the inquiry itself was not maintainable. The HC has posted a further hearing on this issue on Wednesday, when the institute’s lawyer will submit replies to certain queries by the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-critical-of-iim-as-behaviour-with-ex-faculty-member/articleshow/85815313.cms||---

He met PPCC president Navjot Singh Sidhu on Tuesday and is likely to meet chief minister Amarinder Singh on Wednesday. Rawat told media persons, "I will not speak to party leaders through the media. I will be available here for the party leaders over the next two days. They can approach me for whatever issues they have. If not me, then they can approach Congress president Sonia Gandhi or (general secretary) KC Venugopal. I will also try to meet chief minister Amarinder Singh, apart from meeting with the PPCC president. We are not a party like the BJP, where there is no internal democracy." "If there are any issues, we will sort them out. There is only one camp, that is the Congress camp – both the chief minister and PPCC chief belong to that. Whoever wants to meet me can come," he added. Rawat went to Congress Bhawan and met Sidhu as well as working president Kuljit Singh Nagra and general secretary Pargat Singh. Rawat, meanwhile, sought to downplay the ‘Itt naal itt’ remark of Navjot Singh and party general secretary Pargat Singh questioning Rawat’s statement that Amarinder will lead the party into the next Assembly elections. He evaded the question saying that though he doesn’t want to reply to remarks of party leaders through the media. Meanwhile, cabinet minister Rana Gurmeet Singh Sodhi, considered an Amarinder loyalist, also met Rawat. Sodhi later said, "As Rawat ji had met Rahul Gandhi in Delhi to discuss the Punjab affairs recently, I am sure that his visit will put to rest all kinds of bickering and rumours and the party will stand united for the final countdown for the 2022 elections." A section of party MLAs, led by four ministers, had challenged the leadership of the CM last week. Rawat is likely to hear out both sides to make sure the bickering is controlled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/rawat-in-chd-to-douse-pb-cong-flames-meets-sidhu/articleshow/85817628.cms||---

As per a statement issued on Tuesday by GRH dean Dr A Rathinavel, gender reassignment surgery was performed on a 21-year-old BCom graduate and a 24-year-old MCom graduate. The duo, who have been living as transmen for more than 10 years, underwent female to male gender reassignment surgery as per the Tamil Nadu Government National Health Mission (NHM) protocols. “Usually by 10 years of age, the change in thought processes will be noticeable. However, legally, gender reassignment surgery can be done only after 18 years of age. The requirements before the gender reassignment surgery include conditions such as the patient must have lived as a transgender person for at least one year and should have a stable mental state,” said Dr S Sridhar, transgender clinic convener and head, department of endocrinology, GRH. He said the two patients were already under hormone therapy for one year. Hysterectomy and bilateral Salpingo-Oophorectomy was performed by the obstetrics and gynecology team led by department head Dr N Sumathi. Pre-operative and post-operative care was taken care of by the department of plastic surgery led by department head Dr Suresh Kumar. “In the long-run, follow-up is required. Hormone medicines, calcium and vitamin D must be taken to keep bone health since it is affected with the removal of sex organs,” said Dr Sridhar. “We are getting patients from other districts as well. It is easier and safe for patients to get the gender reassignment surgery at our clinic,” said Dr Sridhar. Currently, 37 transgender individuals are at various stages of pre-operative treatment at the clinic. As many as 10 patients are waiting to undergo gender reassignment surgery in due course. Along with the social welfare department, district collectorate of Madurai and the Transgender Board of GRH issue transgender identity cards to 170 individuals after medical assessment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/madurai-grh-doctors-perform-gender-reassignment-surgery-for-first-time/articleshow/85815346.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||In a week, Delhi Police's cyber cell arrest 14 cybercrooks operating from Jamtara||NEW DELHI: In a span of one week, Delhi Police's cyber cell has arrested 14 people for their alleged involvement in operating a Jamtara-based cybercrime module and duping people online. The suspects operated across the Jamtara-Deoghar-Giridih-Jamui belt in Jharkhand and cheated people across the country. The arrests include the two masterminds, Altaf Andari and Ghulam Ansari. The gang exploited open-source tools to carry out their con job, a relatively new modus operandi. The police claim that their operation has resulted in a drop of 29% week-on-week in frauds committed by Jamtara-based fraudsters. Police said the accused would impersonate bank employees and get targets to download remote access apps to gain control over their devices. They also acquired details of pregnant and lactating women from Aanganwadi workers and sent fake links to them, promising government aid. When the targets clicked on the link, their bank accounts were drained instead. The accused also made clones of popular e-commerce platforms and disguised malware as baking apps to dupe people of crores. “A doctor working with a renowned hospital in Delhi approached us with a complaint. The doctor said she was duped by fraudsters of Rs 10 lakh through a fake website of a bank,” said a police officer. The cops managed to block Rs 8 lakh and return it to her, but she suffered a loss of Rs 2 lakh. The police registered FIRs on similar complaints and started tracking the crooks. An analysis of electronic trail data revealed that these scams were being run on a large scale from Jamtara. The members were tracked and a few of them were found to be visiting Loni, Ghaziabad. Ansari was the first accused to be arrested, who led the cops to others. Andari and others were caught from Jharkhand after a chase, cops claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/14-cybercrooks-operating-from-jamtara-arrested-in-a-week/articleshow/85815353.cms||---

On the concerns raised by RSP, he said bilateral talks will be held between the Congress and RSP soon. Satheesan, who was not ready to respond to the queries regarding the controversies over the appointment of the new DCC presidents, said, “The KPCC president has already replied to all the questions and there is nothing more to add. No more public comments on this.” He said the revamping of the district committees and the KPCC is on the cards and the process is about to start. Unlike in the past, a new system is being evolved in the restructuring of the organization and hence there is no time to waste on controversies. However, KPCC president K Sudhakaran has warned that the ongoing issues would not only affect the Congress but also the Congress-led United Democratic Front. While responding to the criticisms levelled by RSP leader Shibu Baby John, he said that Shibu’s criticism was in the good interest of the front. The RSP leader had publicly criticized the Congress saying the party was not drowning but the leaders were drowning the party. He had alleged that RSP understood the need of Congress in the country and stood by them but the Congress leaders were yet to take cognizance of this. Sudhakaran said it was natural for constituents to be concerned about the crisis within the Congress. He said he would hold discussions with the allied parties as early as possible and take steps to allay their apprehensions. Meanwhile, there is difference of opinion within the RSP on continuing in the UDF. Majority of the RSP leaders are of the opinion that the UDF leadership was not giving them due consideration and it was due to the Congress that it could not win even a single seat in the assembly election. KPCC campaign committee chairman and MP K Muraleedharan also said that RSP would not leave UDF and all the issues raised by them would be settled through talks. “Already the UDF convener has said that bilateral talks will be held with the RSP leaders before the next UDF meeting, which is scheduled on September 6. The RSP leaders have raised some issues regarding the defeat in the assembly poll and it will have to be sorted out through discussions,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cong-to-settle-issues-within-udf-eyes-set-on-party-revamp/articleshow/85815336.cms||---

Addressing the media in Malappuram on Tuesday, IUML high power committee member Panakkad Syed Sadikali Shihab Thangal added that the changes in Congress were welcome. “As the party leading the UDF, it has come forward to make changes in tune with the times.

Meanwhile IUML leader MK Muneer too said Congress has the strength to resolve internal issues and added that the IUML didn’t have concerns over it.

Raising the issue of drug mafia in the state, Sidhu said people were eagerly awaiting the report of the special task force (STF) which had been formed to probe the drug mafia in the state. “The STF report in the infamous Rs 6,000-crore Bhola drug racket is likely to be opened by a division bench of the Punjab and Haryana high court on September 1,” he said in a statement. He said as the date was approaching, all eyes were on the high court. “People, especially those who have lost their innocent children to the drug menace, have high hopes that stern action would be taken against the main culprit,” he said. Sidhu said despite the high court’s directions, successive governments had done nothing to extradite 13 drug smugglers back to India, who peddled drugs in Punjab and smuggled drugs to some countries. “These drug smugglers operated under the cover of government security using VIP vehicles provided by a former minister,” he alleged. Sidhu said even a common person could sense why drug smugglers had not been extradited in the last five years. “Because had they been brought to book, they would have spilled the beans and would have exposed the unholy nexus of drug peddlers and politicians,” Sidhu added. “The accused not only roamed in the VIP vehicles of the former minister under security cover, but they also used to reside with him. What are we hiding? Why no action? Why no transparency? Why this delay?” Sidhu questioned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ppcc-chief-raises-drug-issue-again-questions-apathy/articleshow/85817694.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Doctor sets self ablaze after posting on Facebook wall, dies after two weeks||KOLKATA: A 40-year-old doctor, Abantika Bhattacharya, who had set herself on fire at her Behala home on August 16 half-anhour after she posted on Facebook, questioning her transfer after eight years from one “peripheral” service to another, succumbed to her injuries on Sunday night. Her last post on Facebook on August 16 reads “Where peace lies for me ….. job resignation? After eight years of peripheral service … again dragged to another peripheral service…in the same job capacity-…can’t take it any more.” She was first rushed to a local nursing home, from where she was later shifted to SSKM Hospital with 70% burn injuries. Bhattacharya was posted at Midnapore Medical College as an assistant professor. She was transferred to Diamond Harbour Medical College recently. Her husband, a gynaecologist, practises in Murshidabad. The duo has an autistic daughter. Following her death various doctor organisations like Association of Health Service Doctors and Service Doctors Forum have cried foul and demanded fair and transparent transfer policy of health service doctors. “There is no doubt that we need a more transparent transfer policy. It is unbelievable that a doctor would commit suicide because of transfer from one medical college to another,” said a senior health department official. Officials argued that Diamond Harbour Medical College is close to her Behala residence. It would have made things easier for her. Sources said that the doctor had been suffering from depression for some time after the death of her parents. Her father died in 2017. Unable to bear this loss, her mother had killed herself two years ago. “The transfer to another peripheral hospital could be one of the factors but she was silently fighting depression for some time now,” said a doctor. A graduate from Medical College and Hospital Kolkata, she was known for her organisational skills and would take part in various activities. During the pandemic she was part of various Covid campaigns.

Psychologist Amit Chakraborty said she was researching a lot on depression and stress and published a number of research papers, which shows her concern for the issue and thus she was trying to find a way out. “As a specialist in community medicine, she tried to find out stress and depression in various communities. If the authority had been a bit careful and had given her a posting closer to her home, the death could have been avoided.

---||Goa||Odisha join hands with Premier League side Watford||Panaji: Odisha FC have entered into a three-year international club partnership with Premier League side Watford FC that will help them with their juniors, seniors and women’s teams. The Bhubaneswar-based side have been making the right moves this season. At first, they got Spain’s World Cup-winning forward David Villa on board to head the global football operations, then made some interesting signings and have now joined hands with Watford. “They are a very ambitious football club whose vision is similar to what we want to achieve,” said Odisha president Raj Athwal. “This international partnership is very unique. It’s about substance. We are talking about community development and academy that will change the landscape for Odisha FC.” According to the partnership, Odisha could potentially have their pre-season next year in Watford. Some of the Premier League side’s players could also play in the Indian Super League (ISL) on loan, while the club intends to send several youth players to train at the Watford academy. “This will not only develop the aspect of their own game but also help Odisha and Indian football as well,” said Athwal, who previously worked at Watford and has more than 20 years’ experience working across four divisions in England. Watford boasts of a rich history as the original family club and have been trying to expand their fanbase in India. “For a few years, India was an area where we really wanted to expand our fanbase, but we didn’t have a strategy. We tried a lot of on the ground activities,” said Paul O’Brien, the club’s commercial director. When O’Brien met international marketing officer Rohan Shukla, things started rolling. It helped that Odisha now had Athwal as the president. “This is something really quite different and we love to get involved in new things that provide really different experiences for the club and our staff. “Partnering with Odisha FC gives us a chance to get a real insight into football’s global appeal and affords us a great chance to share learnings with a similarly ambitious club,” said O’Brien. Odisha are the third Indian club to tie-up with Premier League sides after East Bengal (Leicester City) and DSK Shivajians (Liverpool). Manchester City and Mumbai City are both part of the City Football Group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/odisha-join-hands-with-premier-league-side-watford/articleshow/85847542.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

Congress had recently appointed four working presidents, along with Navjot Singh Sidhu as the party chief. SAD leader Daljeet Singh Cheema said Rawat must apologise to the Sikh Sangat for his remarks. “It is unfortunate and sad that... after meeting Congress leaders, he said he had met ‘Panj Pyare’... these are not things to joke about just to please someone and he should immediately apologise. The state government too should book him for hurting sentiments.” After meeting Sidhu on Tuesday, Rawat said that it was his responsibility to meet with the PPCC president and his team to discuss various issues ahead of the next elections, including strengthening of the organisational structure. “They are our Panj Pyare, five people,” he said.

Singh passed away on August 21. According to district authorities, Uttarakhand governor Baby Rani Maurya, Rajasthan governor Kalraj Mishra, UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath and deputy CMs Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dinesh Sharma will be visiting Atrauli, where the late leader’s ancestral village Madhauli is located. Many other VIPs, including Union minister of state for steel and rural development Faggan Singh Kulaste and minister of state for rural development and consumer affairs, food and public distribution Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti, will also be visiting. City magistrate Vineet Kumar Singh said, “As thousands of people are expected to attend the rituals that will be held at KMV Inter College on Wednesday, two separate parking areas have been allotted for the public and the VIPs. The entire area has been divided into five zones and 12 sectors.” Talking to TOI, SP (city) Kuldeep Singh Gunawat said, “A total of 4,000 policemen, including 3,000 from neighbouring districts of Mathura, Agra, Firozabad and Kasganj, will be on duty.

---||Visakhapatnam||Andhra Pradesh: Youth account for majority of suicides in Vizianagaram||VISAKHAPATNAM: The number of suicides in Vizianagaram district has been on the rise due to various reasons. Sadly, a majority of the people who die by suicide belong to the 20-35 age group. A few days ago, a woman sub-inspector of police, K Bhavani (25), committed suicide at the police training college in Vizianagaram. Bhavani, a native of Krishna district, was posted in the Sakhinetipalle police station in East Godavari district. Police are yet to find the motive behind her suicide. Recently, an employee at a private firm committed suicide in Vizianagaram. The incident shook his kin as he was the sole breadwinner of the family. Over 150 people took their lives employing various methods (hanging, consuming poison, jumping in water bodies and a few others) in the district during January-August this year. As many as 38 people ended their lives in April alone. Majority of the victims were male and over 90 per cent of them belonged to the 18-35 age group. Interestingly, psychiatrists are not surprised by the trend as they say suicides are the new killers among the youngsters, thanks to modern lifestyle. Experts pointed out that most of the victims (around 80%) were educated. “Covid-19 pandemic was the reason for a majority of suicides reported during April-May as the virus created fear in the minds,” says noted psychiatrist NN Raju. Some people took the extreme step due to depression or personal reasons including losing livelihood,” he added. Suicide has emerged top killer in AP after road accidents. As per the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data, 7,984 people were killed in road accidents while suicides claimed 6,465 lives in the state in 2019. Experts say counselling to the youngsters is the only way to prevent suicides. Physical activities such as sports and games and counselling would check suicidal tendency among youth, they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/youth-account-for-majority-of-suicides-in-vizianagaram/articleshow/85815442.cms||Nalla.Babu

Officials are on alert to evacuate people from low-lying areas along Musi. In late July, seven floodgates were opened after rains lashed the city and upstream areas. Subsequently, only one gate was kept open from July 26 as the water flow dwindled and this was also closed on August 10. On Tuesday, at around 11.30am, the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Boar (HMWS&SB) lifted two floodgates to a height of one feet, and by 5.30pm lifted them by another one feet to release 1,400 cusecs of floodwater into Musi. By 7 pm, the water at the reservoir stood at 1763.2 feet against the full tank level (FTL) of 1763.5 feet, according to HMWS&SB. The inflow was 1,000 cusecs and outflow 1,400 cusecs till 8 pm. “Officials at reservoir site are monitoring the inflows and may lift two more floodgates,” HMWS&SB technical director Ravi Kumar told TOI. HMWS&SB MD, M Dana Kishore, has alerted collectors of Hyderabad, Rangareddy and Medchal as well as police commissionerates about the likely impact of floodwaters in downstream areas. “We have already evacuated people from certain low-lying areas,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/two-gates-lifted-at-himayatsagar/articleshow/85817489.cms||Sunil Mungara

The disruption was caused due to inundation of the Mallaram pump house on August 30. Consumers from areas such as Malkajgiri, Serilingampally, Patancheru, Quthbullapur, Sainkipuri, Nizampet and Bachupally, who had booked tankers, did not receive them on Tuesday. Around 200 tankers were stuck due to the disruption. “The shortage in supply by 110 million gallons of Godavari water hit the tanker supply partially. We did, however, divert Krishna water to the Godavari lines to avoid inconvenience to consumers,” a water board official said. At Mallaram reservoir, HMWS&SB technical director Ravi Kumar monitored the dewatering process at the pump house.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/inundation-at-pump-house-hits-tanker-supply/articleshow/85817458.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Hyderabad: Private schools revert to online, govt & budget ones opt for physical classes||HYDERABAD: Soon after the Telangana high court’s orders, many private and corporate schools across the city decided to continue with online classes as they rolled back their decision to reopen for physical classes. On the other hand, most budget and government schools have decided to either offer only offline classes or adopt the hybrid model by offering both offline and online classes. With a banner stating ‘Welcome Back’ and balloons at the entrance, the management of Meridian School in Banjara Hills was looking forward to resume physical classes from September 1. In the verandah, the school staff was taking up extensive cleaning and sanitisation measures. However, the school had to halt preparations following the court orders which stated that it was up to school managements to have either only offline classes or only online or both offline and online classes. “We were all set to welcome more than 300 students for physical classes from September 1. However, after the HC orders, we decided to continue online classes for the time being and assess the situation after a week once the government comes up with detailed guidelines,” said principal and chief executive officer of Meridian Schools, Usha Reddy. Similar was the case at P Obul Reddy Public School in Yousufguda where not only the teaching staff but the student council also turned up to ensure preparations were in place for physical reopening after a break of almost eight months. “In view of HC orders, we decided to continue with online classes for now. As per the academic calendar, term exams for many classes are scheduled from mid-September. Therefore, it’s only fair to roll back to online mode for now,” said principal Lata Shankar. While private and corporate schools have decided to continue online classes, budget and government schools termed online education to be ineffective due to the digital divide. Owing to this, many have decided to go ahead with physical reopening. Budget schools are worried as they may have to hold online classes for students who decide not to attend physical classes, adding more pressure on teachers who would work in a hybrid model. “In most budget schools, over 50 per cent parents are willing to send their children for physical classes. Following the HC orders, we will not compel any student to attend physical classes and would ensure that students education is not compromised. At the same time, we would resume physical classes by following all Covid-19 standard operating procedures,” said Sadula Madhusudan, general secretary, Telangana State Recognised School Managements Association.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pvt-schools-revert-to-online-govt-budget-ones-opt-for-physical-classes/articleshow/85816571.cms||Preeti Biswas
---||Mumbai||Bombay high court upholds RERA tribunal order for refund to Wadala towers’ flat buyers over ‘possession delay’||MUMBAI: In a setback to Bombay Dyeing and Manufacturing Company, which developed two “ultra-luxurious” towers in Wadala, Bombay high court on Monday upheld a tribunal’s order directing it to refund with interest amounts received from buyers who had booked flats in 2012-13. The flats were to be delivered by 2017. Ashok Narang, a realtor, and other buyers had initially filed a complaint with Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority (MahaRERA) alleging delay in possession. They sought refund and an exit under Section 18 and invoked Section 12 of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA) for compensation. They alleged reduced amenities and other “unilateral changes” in the apartment and project layout by the builder while registering the then ongoing project in May 2017 when the MahaRera Act came into force. The developer said amenities were provided. Section 12 of RERA places an obligation on a builder or promoter of a project for “veracity” of an advertisement or brochure. It says when a buyer who has paid a deposit based on information in a brochure or advertisement suffers a loss due to false information contained in it, he can be compensated by the builder. The HC judgment by Justice C V Bhadang held: “Section 12 would also apply to the obligation of the promoter regarding the information given...prior to the registration of the project under the RERA Act of 2016 as ongoing project.” The provision is “retroactive”, the HC held. The HC said the “brochure indeed mentions the date of possession as 2017”. The developer said the date was subject to its disclaimer in the brochure. The HC rejected the argument, saying the disclaimer did not mention the date of possession. The buyers had got no relief from MahaRERA but in December 2019, Maharashtra Real Estate Appellate Tribunal cancelled the allotments and had directed the developer to refund the money. They had paid Rs 2 crore or 20% of the flat cost when booking. Aggrieved, Bombay Dyeing went to the HC in a second appeal. Its counsel Dinyar Madon, J P Sen and Niyathi Kalra argued that the Act requires an agreement for sale to be in existence in writing, for builder’s obligation under Section 12 or 18 (compensation to buyer over delay in possession) to kick in. Shiraz Rustomjee, counsel for the buyers, said there was no mention in the law specifically for a written agreement for sale, except in Section 13, which bars any deposit or advance being taken by a builder sans an agreement for sale. The HC “found force” in buyers’ argument that Section 18 and the definition of “agreement for sale” in the Act “do not provide for the requirement of a written agreement of sale”. “Had the legislature intended the agreement referred to in Section 18 also to be in writing, nothing prevented it from doing so,” said the HC ruling, though the judge said he does “not propose to lay down an absolute proposition of binding nature on the issue” since the refund is also based on violation of Section 12 of RERA. The HC dismissed the builder’s appeal and did not grant a stay. The builder may appeal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hc-upholds-rera-tribunal-order-for-refund-to-wadala-towers-flat-buyers-over-possession-delay/articleshow/85811140.cms||Swati Deshpande

At St Christopher High School in Banjara Hills, a budget school with around 700 students, the management has decided to allow students in batches for only two hours to begin with. “Only twenty students will be allowed to come at a time in a single batch. Only one student will be made to sit on a single bench...For students who don’t attend classes physically, we will offer online classes in the evening,” said St Christopher principal, Brigette Michael. Some schools have also set up isolation wards, tied up with hospitals — in case of emergency — and employed trained nurses as part of their Covid-19 SOP. “We are adopting a blended learning model for class 9-12 wherein those who want to attend physically can come to school from September 1. We have an isolation facility in place...It is a dynamic situation and we will incorporate changes as required,” said Amritha Chandra, principal, Hyderabad Public School, Begumpet. At government schools, mid-day meals will be provided to all students. “We are expecting over 50 per cent students from all classes to attend school ,” said Narra Manjulatha, headmistress of Government High School, Raj Bhavan Road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hybrid-classes-shorter-hrs-the-new-normal/articleshow/85816805.cms||Preeti Biswas

For second time in little over a month, they are staring at a fresh flood threat after authorities lifted two floodgates of Himayatsagar reservoir on Tuesday. With no let up in rain, residents living in these low-lying areas said that they had nowhere to go if their localities were inundated. “A similar situation arose last month and we had no place to go except for a mosque which was already occupied by those who could go there first,” said Mohammad Imran, a resident of Shanker Nagar. HMWS&SB and GHMC officials are monitoring the situation and said that they would issue a high alert if it is necessary. “In case they are going to open more gates or the water level increases, we request the GHMC officials to arrange some temporary shelters with basic amenities so that those with children can stay comfortably,” said Yakub Khan, a resident of Chadherghat. Allaying fears, G Rajnikanth, GHMC deputy commissioner of Charminar zone, said, “Right now, there is no threat of inundation. If necessary, we have a community hall in Afzal Nagar. Food will also be arranged from Annapurna canteens. There are about 100 families in downstream areas that are vulnerable to floods if more gates are opened.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/threat-of-flood-looms-over-homes-near-musi/articleshow/85817428.cms||---

There is no difference between the organ of a person without a criminal antecedent and the organ of a person who has no criminal antecedents. Human blood is passing through all of us,” Justice PV Kunhikrishnan said in the judgment. The court was considering a plea challenging district level authorization committee’s decision rejecting application of a donor citing his involvement in multiple criminal cases. In the judgment, the court said, “If this stand of the respondent (committee) is allowed, I apprehend that the respondent will reject applications if the donor is a murderer, thief, rapist, or involved in minor criminal offences. I hope one day they do not reject applications if the donor is a Hindu, Christian, Muslim, Sikh, or person in a lower caste after comparing the religion and caste of the recipient.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/person-involved-in-criminal-case-can-donate-organs-hc/articleshow/85815540.cms||---

Since local MLAs are attending party office foundation stone in Delhi, local leadership should take up the responsibility of making the programme a big success,” KTR said. All the committees should have 51% of people from SC, ST and minority communities. Committees which fail to provide the mandated representation will not be recognised by the party leadership, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/trs-to-form-basti-divisional-panels/articleshow/85817744.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

An estimated one crore in the state are yet to receive their first dose. Authorities have set a target of 50 lakh doses for the month of September and have urged people to keep festivities low-key. So far, 95 per cent of the eligible population in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) area have been administered the first dose while around 1.4 crore across the state have received the first dose. “This month, we are planning to administer 50 lakh vaccinations. The remaining one crore who have not received the first dose will be covered by Dasara,” said state director of public health Dr G Srinivasa Rao. The DPH added that, in the meantime, people should follow Covid-appropriate behaviour as the pandemic is not over and there remains a threat to the susceptible population. Even as vaccination is scaled up slowly, the fact that political activity has picked up in the state has been another cause of concern for authorities. “With the increase in padyatras and rallies, political parties and leaders have to take responsibility to ensure that people wear masks and follow social distancing. Although the situation is under control and a surge might not be seen unless a new variant emerges, sporadic cases are being reported and we need to be careful,” Dr Srinivasa Rao said.

The MNS, which led the defiance, broke ground level pots at most locations. Police did not make arrests but briefly detained the offenders and released them afterwards. Maharashtra government had issued guidelines warning revellers to avoid forming human pyramids on Gokulashtami in the face of the pandemic. Prominent detainees were MNS leaders Bala Nandgaonkar, Akhil Chitre and Sandeep Deshpande who each led party workers to break handis in Kalachowkie, Kala Nagar Bandra and Dadar-Shivaji Park. Party leader Raj Thackeray had insisted the festival would be celebrated despite curbs. Mumbai police named 120 people in the FIRs collectively and detained 85. In Thane, though, 10 MNS workers were arrested. Nandgaonkar was taken in after he led a band of protesters at Kalachowkie. A video surfaced of Akhil Chitre and party worker Omkar Khandekar breaking a handi tied to a tree trunk near the CM’s residence in Bandra East. Chitre was booked by Kherwadi police station. At Saki Naka, police detained nine MNS workers for trying to form a human pyramid on Ghatkopar Link Road. Bhandup police booked 20-25 persons, Parksite 15-20, Worli four, Ghatkopar 10, and at Shivaji Park, cops detained and seized a handi from 20-25 MNS partymen, including Sandeep Deshpande. Kasturba Marg police station in Borivli registered a violation of lockdown guidelines as people crowded a temple for Janmashtami. In Vartak Nagar, Thane, five MNS activists assembled in the early hours of the morning to form a five-tier pyramid. A similar case surfaced in Naupada. Ravi Kshirsagar, senior inspector, confirmed arrests. All accused were released on bail. Heavy bandobast was deployed at Bhagvati School ground in Thane where police dismantled the MNS’s dahi handi stage on Monday. The Sena-led Tembhi Naka Mandal conducted a medical camp while party MLA Pratap Sarnaik, a major organiser of dahi handi, installed two oxygen plants instead. The BJP in Dombivli led a march against the ban. In Kalyan-Dombivli, the MNS avoided dahi handi after police notices. In Badlapur, women karyakartas broke a ground level pot and were detained briefly. Accustomed to nine-tier pyramids, the biggest govinda pathaks sat out the season. The youth of Tadwadi Mazgaon offered prayers at seven shrines, after which a little boy broke a handi at eye level. The few present included corporator Sonam Jamsutkar.

---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Stranded shepherd with 50 sheep rescued after 24-hour-ordeal in Sircilla||HYDERABAD: More than 24 hours after he was stranded in an area cut off because of an overflowing stream, a shepherd was rescued by authorities in Rajanna Sircilla district after several hours of suspense. As a result of the heavy inflows into a check dam near the Maneru stream in the district, teams that began a rescue operation also got stranded in the middle of the water. With more teams drafted into the rescue operation, apart from the shepherd, five members of a rescue team who got stranded in the water were also brought to safety by Tuesday evening. The shepherd with 50 of his sheep had been stranded since Monday evening near the Maneru stream in Rajanna Sircilla district. Chandramouli of Subhasnagar in Sircilla town had taken his sheep for grazing but by evening, heavy flow of water near a check dam made it impossible for him to return home. “He called us up on phone to tell him about his situation. We thought the water would recede but he is still stranded. We are worried for him as he also had not had food,” a family member of Chandramouli had said. After over 24 hours, Chandramouli remained stranded on Tuesday evening. Efforts to reach to Chandramouli were made by locals and the authorities but the group which could go to a certain area in the stream was not able to go further to fetch the shepherd from the place where he was stranded on the other side of the stream. The heavy rain in Sircilla district also resulted in huge inflows into streams, cutting off the road network at many places. Such has been the flow of water at Gambhiraopet, another place in the same district, that an RTC bus which got stuck in the water on Monday, was washed away on Tuesday morning. There were 20 passengers aboard when the bus got caught in the waters but local villagers pulled them to safety with the help of ropes on Monday itself. In several districts, the road network has been cut off as a result of the incessant rains. With reservoirs brimming, the gates were opened to release water and the public was cautioned against going near the water flow.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/stranded-shepherd-with-50-sheep-rescued-after-24-hr-ordeal-in-sircilla/articleshow/85817341.cms||Ch Sushil Rao

It appears so, with some of them doing away with the mandatory safety kit – mask, face shield, sanitisers and PPE suit – handed out to every passenger until recently. Flyers who TOI spoke to claimed that the strict checks onboard an aircraft too have stopped now, with many allowed to sit even without their masks. “I was shocked when the ground staff told me that it is no longer compulsory to wear the face shield or PPE (for those occupying the middle seat), when I went to ask for the kit,” said a flustered Barnali Bose who was travelling on a flight from Delhi to Hyderabad, on Tuesday, with her nine-year-old. On August 25, the ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW) issued revised guidelines for domestic travel. While the order stated that there is “no requirement of the usage of body coverall/apron for the passengers” travelling by airlines, ship, railways, it maintained that wearing masks and face covers is still mandatory and that they “must be worn properly”. It also instructed airlines/railways/ship/bus operators to “keep a reserve of masks, face shield, hand sanitiser etc for passengers”. “It is appalling to see airlines being so slack,” said another passenger, Shahil Shah who travelled between Hyderabad and Bengaluru recently. “While I can agree with PPE suits being done away with, I think it is dangerous to stop giving masks and face shields to passengers. Especially now, when there are strong indications of a third wave,” he said. “Though we were given the kit, most flyers didn’t wear the face shield. Nobody, including the airline crew, seemed to mind,” said a passenger who flew from Hyderabad to Delhi – with a senior citizen — onboard another private airline, over the weekend. While airline operators like Air India, TruJet told TOI that they were not longer using PPE suits but still giving masks and face shields, IndiGo’s statement read: “We are adhering to all guidelines and keep a stock of masks and shields inside the cabin to be provided to customers on request”. There is no waiver for any airline. The rule of giving masks, face shields etc is still applicable to all||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/mask-face-shield-not-must-airlines-getting-lax-flyers/articleshow/85817049.cms||Sudipta Sengupta
---||Mumbai||‘Deputy RTO managed postings in Maharashtra state depts, ran franchises’||Mumbai: Enforcement Directorate officials have found that deputy RTO Bajrang Kharmate, whose premises were raided by the Enforcement Directorate on Monday, had amassed wealth by “managing” postings in government departments, including the police department, sources said. The ED found that Kharmate ran three franchises of a multinational electronics appliances company and two franchises of a branded jewellery company in Pune. He owned the premises from where these establishments were housed and ran the franchises with the help of his relative in Pune. The ED also found he owned a commercial premises in Pune which he rented out to a public sector bank, apart from substantial land parcels at his village. ED officials suspect Kharmate was the real owner of two high-end vehicles shown in his brother’s name. The ED had summoned transport minister Anil Parab from the Shiv Sena, who through his lawyer submitted a letter seeking exemption for 14 days. The ED’s action against Kharmate is part of the money laundering case it is investigating against former state home minister Anil Deshmukh. The ED had called Parab for a statement on Tuesday but he didn’t turn up and asked for 14 days’ exemption. Parab was unavailable for comment. Kharmate is working in the department headed by Parab and is not new to controversy. Earlier, Kharmate was suspended twice for his involvement in corrupt practices, and there were several similar allegations against him. During the investigation in the Deshmukh case, ED recorded the statements of several witnesses who told the agency that Kharmate had collected money on behalf of his contact in the government for postings. The ED is investigating the money laundering case against Deshmukh and others based on the CBI FIR alleging corruption. Former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh alleged that Deshmukh had asked now-dismissed police officer Sachin Waze to illegally collect Rs 100 crore from restaurant and bar owners in the city every month for him. It is also investigating the former chief of the state intelligence department, Rashmi Shukla’s report where she recorded the phone conversation of some influential persons who were promising desired postings for police officers, including IPS postings, in exchange for money.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/deputy-rto-managed-postings-in-maharashtra-state-depts-ran-franchises/articleshow/85818941.cms||Vijay V Singh

According to them, getting details online will help them make an informed choice of their representatives at the civic body.Ottilie Anban Kumar, a social activist in Dharwad, said: “Voters should be aware about their candidates. While digitisation and transparency is spoken about at the national level, Karnataka State Election Commission (KSEC) is yet to adopt this at the state level. The office of the chief electoral cfficer (Karnataka) uploads documents like candidates’ affidavits, forms 20, 21E, 21D pertaining to a particular election. This enhances social and moral accountability of candidates as details on their assets, liabilities and criminal background are in public domain. KSEC following the same will help voters make a conscious choice.” Sunil Kulkarni, a techie and president of Kalyan Karnataka Grahakara Vedike (Kalaburagi), said people from real estate, business, industry, education, medical and other sectors are entering politics. “Some candidates contest from other ward if their ward is reserved for other-category candidates or women. In that case, we cannot know about such candidates,” he said, adding: “When asked, officials said they are displaying the affidavits at the office of the Returning Officer (RO), where candidates file nominations. It does not serve purpose as people won’t visit the RO’s office unless they have work there, and avoid visits during the pandemic. It’s time SEC uploads the details,” he added.HDMC commissioner Suresh Itnal said there is no direction from KSEC to do so. “Anyway, they have been put up on the noticeboard in the RO office. People can see the affidavits there,” he said.B Basavaraaju, Karnataka State Election Commissioner (Bengaluru), said they will consider this genuine demand seriously. “We will try to upload the copies of affidavits in the coming days. But it’s not possible for ULB polls of Hubballi-Dharwad, Belagavi and Kalaburagi,” he clarified.BOXAAP shares candidates’ affidavits with mediaHubballi: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has shared with media the copy of affidavits of its 40 candidates contesting the HDMC polls.In a press release, Santosh Nargund, the Dharwad district president of AAP, said there is no provision of uploading the affidavits on Election Commission’s website. “So AAP candidates have voluntarily have made public their affidavits. After sharing them with media, we will upload them on the party’s Facebook page. We have also shared on WhatsApp groups a chart showing the education background of our candidates. None of our candidates has a criminal case,” he said, adding: “We had received over 600 applications. But we scruitinised them and issued tickets to only 40 aspirants.”Santosh also dared other parties to put the affidavits of their candidates in public domain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/absence-of-details-hindrance-to-make-informed-choice-voters/articleshow/85813165.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

Despite notices served by the Irrigation department, NHAI is going ahead with the construction. Irrigation department responded to the notices issued by NGT regarding a petition filed by D Satyanarayana, a resident of Suryapet district. Suryapet District Irrigation Executive Engineer D Bhadru in the affidavit said, ''Alignment of the NH-365 BB is passing through the Chuttugunta Lake. Its officials have not taken any prior permission and also not taken the NOC before starting the work from the Minor Irrigation Officials who are the authority of Tanks and Lakes in the state. The officials have executed work by encroaching into the Full Tank Level (FTL) of the lake which causes reduction in the capacity consequently and the ayacut irrigated under this lake will also get reduced.” Even after issuing notices, NH-365BB work has been resumed in June 2020, he added. He said,“Instead of forming the road using the soil with a culvert in the middle, they have to construct a fly over bridge with piers all along the length of the alignment of NH without affecting any elements pertaining to the lake. . The other options is that the NH-365 BB authorities have to choose another alignment for forming the road so that it won’t affect the FTL and Buffer zone of the lake.” The work is part of upgrading NH 365 from 10.5m width to 33m.

Surrounded by around two dozen supporters, Chaudhary reached the Mandir Marg police station amid chants of “Pinky Bhaiya Zindabad” and “Jai Shri Ram”. The supporters lifted him on their shoulders and walked towards the police station. In a video that surfaced online on Monday, Chaudhary was seen denying all allegations against him and said that he would surrender and cooperate with the police investigation. Chaudhary was arrested around 2.30pm.  Delhi Police had registered a case after a video, showing objectionable slogans being raised against a community during a protest at Jantar Mantar on August 8, was widely circulated on social media. Police have already arrested eight people — Uttam Upadhyay, Ashwini Upadhyay, Preet Singh, Deepak Singh, Deepak Kumar, Vinod Sharma, Vinit Bajpai and Sushil Tiwari — in connection with the case. Since then, raids were being conducted in the national capital and neighbouring states to arrest Chaudhary. In a video that surfaced on Monday, he said, “Neither I nor anyone else in my organisation did anything wrong at Jantar Mantar. I respect the court and will surrender on August 31. It is the right of every person to go to court and I did the same. All the allegations against me are false and baseless. I have devoted my life towards Hinduism and Hindutva. As long as I am alive, I will continue to work for my religion.”  Delhi High Court on Friday had refused to grant interim protection from arrest to Chaudhary.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/slogan-case-hindu-raksha-dal-chief-pinki-surrenders/articleshow/85815544.cms||---

Some senior party leaders here are of the opinion that it is not advisable to invite Rahul Gandhi to address a public meeting when the by-poll to Huzurabad Assembly constituency is around the corner. Congress seniors said that the BJP and TRS will get an opportunity to target Rahul Gandhi in connection with the by-poll result even if he is addressing a public meeting away from Huzurabad constituency. The Congress has not won this seat for three decades now. It is essentially a contest between the TRS and BJP in Huzurabad. The BJP may field Eatala Rajender, Telangana CM K Chandrasekhar Rao’s friend-turned-foe who defected from the TRS earlier this year following a row over graft allegations. Earlier, the Telangana Congress leaders had decided to organise a huge Dandora public meeting to be addressed by Congress former president Rahul Gandhi. They had proposed to conduct it at Warangal, which is considered as the second capital city of Telangana. Some seniors have suggested that opposition leader in Rajya Sabha, Mallikarjun Kharge, be instead invited to one of the Dandora public meetings to be held before the Huzurabad bypoll and that Rahul Gandhi be called after the bypoll. Though Kharge likes to be identified as a Congressman more than anything else, the fact remains that he is a popular leader from Dalit community. With Dalits becoming a focal point in Telangana politics, inviting Kharge to address a Dandora public meeting would be a smart move, said a senior Congress leader.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-cong-hesitant-to-invite-raga-to-address-public-ahead-of-bypoll/articleshow/85817781.cms||Roushan Ali

As per the notification of the election commission, non-voting supporters of the candidates or party and party leaders are not allowed to stay in the wards going for election. According to Ashok Chandaragi, an activist, several MES supporters from the border districts of Maharashtra normally visit the city to support the candidates. Since RT-PCR negative report is mandatory to enter the state, they may choose secret routes to avoid scrutiny. Chandaragi said the district administration has to be more careful as a third wave is knocking the doors of the district and already there are reports of many children being admitted to hospitals. The deputy commissioner has to take stern action against parties flouting Covid 19 norms, he added.Superintendent of olice Laxman Nimbaragi told TOI that security at the border has been tightened further and not a single person is allowed without RT-PCR report except emergency cases. Police deployed at the border are doing excellent work and sending back people who do not carry negative reports. Even those who have a vaccine certificate are required to undergo RT-PCR tests. Nimbaragi said that after screening at the state border, checking will take place at the city borders too. Belagavi is able to contain the spread of the virus despite being close to Maharashtra due to strict implementation of the law.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/bcc-polls-high-alert-on-ktaka-maha-border/articleshow/85813238.cms||Shreyas HS

The NGO found that land mafia, with the connivance of revenue and registration departments, has usurped large areas of tribal land using fake documents. The four-member commission headed by N Padmanabhan, chairman of Jananeethi, said that on August 8, 2021, early morning, a police team headed by Sholayur CI TK Vinod Krishna ‘forcefully entered the tribal hamlets and arrested Vattalukki tribal hamlet chief Choriya Mooppan and his son, who were opposing the move to start construction in 55 acres allotted by the government to a trust headed by a former chief secretary of the state’. The land originally belonged to the tribespeople, the commission found. “The arrest was to stifle the tribespeople’s struggle against the official-land mafia nexus to usurp the tribal land using fake documents,” the report said. “There are shocking incidents of land grab by the land mafia in Attapadi. If this is not checked, it will end up in the genocide of the marginalized tribal population of Attapadi, the tribal heartland of the state,” the report added. The report sought urgent attention of the government, the judiciary, general public, democratic institutions, etc on the issue. The report also urged the state government to suspend the Sholayur CI who committed police excess in arresting the tribal chief and his son early in the morning from their hamlet. The report also sought “action against those officials who had tried to give away 2,000 acres belonging to the Attapadi Co-operative Farming Society (ACFS) created to settle the tribal families.” The report demanded an investigation into all land transactions in Attapadi during the last 25 years to bring to light the alienation of tribal and government land in Attapadi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/large-scale-land-grab-taking-place-in-attapadi/articleshow/85815613.cms||---

Now, since the appointment letters have been issued, we are expecting the new employees to join our dairy from Wednesday,” he said. “After my husband’s death during the pandemic, we were struggling to meet our expenses,” said Nipurna Dave, mother of two and one of the beneficiaries. “I have got the much-needed job without which I will have turned helpless. I am grateful to the dairy for providing me a job and a stable source of income,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/family-members-of-23-covid-19-victims-get-job-at-dudhsagar-dairy/articleshow/85813347.cms||---

Leader of opposition Harpal Singh Cheema said a special session dedicated to Guru Teg Bahadur was welcome but the ruling party was avoiding facing public issues in the House. “They fear that the government’s shortcomings and failures would make headlines during this pre-election session as today, even after four-and-a-half years, the Captain government does not have a single achievement,” he said. Taking a dig at the chief minister and Navjot Singh Sidhu, Cheema said even the PCC president cannot have the session extended. AAP MLA Aman Arora said he has brought a private member’s bill to cancel the power pacts and now it will be seen whether Sidhu and his fellow MLAs support this pro-people bill or run away from it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/aap-wants-assembly-to-sit-for-15-days/articleshow/85817849.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Lucknowallah who led queer rights movement||LUCKNOW: He was a fountainhead of knowledge, a reserved historian with a sense of humour that lifted the spirits of his friends and a man who was a confidante to many members of the LGBTQAI community. Noted historian and gay rights activist Saleem Kidwai, who left Lucknow and this world for the hereafter on Monday morning, left behind him generations of students, scholars, intellectuals, friends, community and brethren mourning this sudden and irreparable loss to culture. With fever gripping him a couple of days back, Kidwai, 70, fell to an unknown infection in lungs that spread to the heart. Co-author of ‘Same Sex Love In India: Readings from Literature and History’ with Ruth Vanita, Kidwai opened up about his own sexuality in the 1980-90s as a professor of history at Ramjas College. He returned to Lucknow after taking a VRS in 2002 where he became the support system for several closeted community members. In fact, it was his book that featured in the Supreme Court’s judgment that struck down a part of section 377 of the Indian Penal Code. Not just an admirer of Begum Akhtar, Kidwai was an insider in the life of the music doyen and knew her personally. She was also his neighbour. “The loss of Saleem would perhaps take forever to sink in. He was the foundation of Sanatkada, a go-to-person for not just his friends, but all who visited the city from far and beyond. Researchers, scholars, intellectuals, members of the gay community, history and arts lovers would all want to meet him when in town and he would give them an opportunity to pick his brain,” said friend and founder of Sanatkada, Madhavi Kuckreja.  Saleem kidwai (R) with Begum Akhtar and Agha Shahid Ali.“He was very particular with the written word. What would go in our social media posts, publications and all other literary aspects of Sanatkada had the Saleem stamp on them. He would even chide me when there was carelessness in any such aspect he held so dearly,” she added. Kidwai was buried at his ancestral town of Baragaon in Barabanki district on Monday amid rains. “He once said that Begum Akhtar’s funeral took place in the dark during torrential rains and that a flock of white birds flew across the sky that day. Metaphorically so, Saleem’s burial was also under the rainy sky that seemed to remind us of the fondness he held for Begum Akhtar even during his death,” she added. Mythologist and author Devdutt Pattnaik also paid his tribute to Kidwai. He wrote, “Just heard about Saleem Kidwai passing away....feeling so sad...met him so many times after I read “Same sex love in India” and he spoke so wonderfully about his gay life.” Actor and director Sudhanva Deshpande said, “A brilliant teacher, a thoughtful thinker, wonderful scholar, the nicest man. When I think grace and dignity, I think Saleem. The discourse around gay issues was advanced greatly by him and his work. He was a nurturing presence — both as a teacher and an activist. Never sought the limelight.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lucknowallah-who-led-queer-rights-movement/articleshow/85817878.cms||Yusra Husain
---||Goa||Goa: BJP government has no moral right to remain in office, says Congress||PANAJI: Congress on Tuesday called on governor P S Sreedharan Pillai and requested him to dismiss the present BJP government over its “failure to maintain law and order” in the state. The Congress delegation submitted a letter to Pillai highlighting the deteriorating law and order situation while listing out 18 crimes over the past year beginning with the gang war killing at Santa Cruz on June 21 and ending with the assault on a doctor on August 29. “There are rapes, murders, kidnappings, gang wars, happening almost on a daily basis. BJP government headed by chief minister Pramod Sawant has transformed Goa into a criminal hub. This government has no moral right to remain in power. There is complete collapse of law and order in the state,” the party stated in its letter to the governor. Opposition leader Digambar Kamat said a government that cannot provide security and maintain law and order doesn’t deserve to be there, while state Congress president Girish Chodankar alleged that the government’s investigating machinery is compromised to help culprits who are relatives or supporters of BJP. If proper investigation had to take place, criminals wouldn’t have had the guts to commit crimes, Chodankar said, adding that drugs and gambling are fuelling crimes in the state. The party stated that an attempt to abduct a girl in Ponda “shows that there is no fear in the minds of criminals about police and the government”. “The anti-social elements feel that Goa is now a criminal destination. This government did not take any corrective measures to control the criminal activities in Goa after coming to power,” the party stated in its letter. The delegation led by Chodankar and Kamat also comprised working president Alexio Sequeira and vice presidents M K Shaikh and Sankalp Amonkar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bjp-govt-has-no-moral-right-to-remain-in-office-congress/articleshow/85815670.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: After a spate of accidents, 1st death on GMLR flyover||MUMBAI: In a case of accidental death, a first on the newly inaugurated Ghatkopar-Mankhurd Link Road (GMLR) flyover, a 34-year-old pillion rider died after he fell from the bike his friend was riding on Monday afternoon. Deceased Yusuf Khan owns a timber business in Mandala, Mankhurd. He was was riding pillion with his friend Akhtar Khan from his Shivaji Nagar residence towards his shop while it was still raining. TimesViewThere have been serious concerns about the safety of this flyover ever since it was thrown open to traffic a month ago. The BMC must find out whether there was shoddy work by the contractor and why the surface is slippery. It must ensure such fatal accidents do not occur again.“When Akhtar pressed brakes, the bike skidded and Yusuf lost balance and fell on the rear side,” said an officer at the Deonar police station. He sustained severe head injuries and died on the spot due to heavy bleeding, said sources. Yusuf’s body was handed over to his relatives after a postmortem at the Rajawadi Hospital. Akhtar also sustained injuries, said police. Yusuf is survived by a six-year-old son and his wife, who is pregnant, said a source. Since its inauguration on August 1, there have been a spate of accidents on this flyover, said a source. Opposition parties have slammed the BMC and alleged that the 2.9km flyover was made open to motorists in a hurry, and work on it had not been fully completed. The flyover project cost Rs 580 crore. The BJP in the BMC also said that the contractor should be pulled up for the shoddy work on the flyover, while members of the Aam Adami Party (AAP) said inferior quality of material was leading to accidents and deaths in Mumbai. Manoj Kotak, BJP MP from the area, said that the quality of work has not been satisfactory and the issue was raised with the civic bridges department. “At the inauguration too, the chief minister asked the BMC to pay attention to the surface of the flyover. Despite this, nothing was done,” said Kotak. Nominated corporator Bhalchandra Shirsat from the BJP said that despite spending several crores, tar can be seen on the surface. It makes the road slippery for motorists. “Even now, the bridge has not been opened to heavy vehicles,” he said. But officials said there is a high tension wire on the flyover whose height needs to be raised further before it can be opened to heavy vehicles. Samajwadi party leader in the BMC Rais Shaikh said the flyover was not ready for opening and it could be clearly made out on the day of the inauguration. “It is unclear why there was so much pressure on throwing open the flyover in a hurry,” he said. A senior BMC official from the bridges department said the surface of the road is made of mastic, and in the coming days, milling work would be taken up. “The rider could be driving at high speed,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-after-a-spate-of-accidents-1st-death-on-gmlr-flyover/articleshow/85817899.cms||Richa Pinto
---||Patna||Covid-19: Bihar records highest 23 lakh vax shots in a single day||PATNA: Over 23.44 lakh doses of Covid-19 vaccines were administered across the state on Tuesday, the highest in a single day in Bihar so far. Health minister Mangal Pandey said the figures may further increase by late evening as the officials were updating the data from rural areas. The mega drive, christened Mahatika Abhiyaan 1.0, involved over 28,000 manpower. Nearly 30 lakh vaccine doses had been distributed in advance to different districts to avoid any shortage. Pandey said this would help the state government meet the target of vaccinating six crore people by December this year and in tackling the predicted third wave of Covid-19. He credited Prime Minister Narendra Modi for providing free vaccines, which he said could make such a drive successful. Additional chief secretary (health) Pratyaya Amrit said the department would hold more such drives in the coming days to vaccinate the maximum number of beneficiaries before the festive season. “The success of this drive shows two things — the tremendous support of people and a good team work. From district magistrates to health department officials and workers, everyone worked hard to achieve the target,” said Pratyaya. He said over 13,000 vaccinators and another 15,000 data entry operators and health workers were involved in the Tuesday’s drive. Health department special secretary Sanjay Kumar Singh, who also holds the charge of state health department executive director, said, “By around 8pm, 20.32 lakh people had been administered the doses. This number will increase.” So far, Uttar Pradesh has vaccinated the maximum number of 31 lakh people on a single day. Even the second highest single-day vaccination was also in UP — 29 lakh people — followed by Madhya Pradesh, where 25 lakh people were vaccinated in a day. “If we cross the 25 lakh mark by late night, Bihar will be ahead of MP on this count,” an official said. Bihar had earlier administered the maximum 9.26 lakh doses on August 5. The break-up till 8:15PM for Bihar shows that the maximum 1.61 lakh doses were administered in East Champaran, followed by Patna (1.20 lakh doses) and Samastipur (1.0 lakh). As per the quota of vaccines distributed, East Champaran had got the maximum over two lakh doses, followed by Patna (1.93 lakh doses), Darbhanga (1.26 lakh doses) and Samastipiur (1.23 lakh doses).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/state-records-highest-23l-vax-shots-in-a-single-day/articleshow/85815629.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Kozhikode||Woman’s kin allege domestic violence||Kozhikode: The parents and relatives of Sunisha (26) – who was found dead at her husband’s home in Korome near Kannur on Sunday – alleged that domestic violence had forced her to take the extreme step. Sunisha was found hanging in the bathroom on Sunday evening in a case of suspected suicide. Sunisha and Vijeesh were married one-and-a-half years ago. But, in a new development, audio clips of the purported conversation between Sunisha and her husband, in which she is heard telling about the alleged domestic violence and harassment she had to suffer at her husband’s house, surfaced. In another audio clip, she is heard telling her brother Sudheesh to take her back home, adding that she wasn’t unsure how long she will be alive if she remained there. In one audio clip, Sunisha is even heard saying that her mother-in-law had dragged her by her hair and kicked her. Her parents and relatives alleged that though they lodged a complaint with Payyannur police earlier this month, no case was registered and she was sent back to her husband’s home after talks with both families. Sudheesh said that though they had complained to the police about domestic violence, the police didn't register a case or take effective action to prevent it. “We complained on Aug 5 and Aug 6 and the police summoned both parties. Sunisha herself told the police about the physical and mental torture she experienced at her husband’s house. But, police didn’t give her due consideration and sent her to the husband’s home after they gave assurances that such incidents won’t happen,” said another relative. Meanwhile, Payyannur police said they have registered a case for unnatural death under CrPC 174 and the section will be altered if they find evidence of domestic violence or other factors behind the death. When asked why a case was not registered on the earlier complaint by Sunisha’s mother regarding the harassment her daughter was experiencing, Payyannur inspector said that the complaint had not mentioned any cognizable offence against Sunisha’s husband and had mainly mentioned about his parents scolding her.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/womans-kin-allege-domestic-violence/articleshow/85815665.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Lucknow||Saleem Kidwai leaves behind a soulful legacy||By-Jayant KrishnaHistorian Saleem Kidwai’s death at the age of 70 is devastating, to say the least. Hailing from the illustrious Kidwai family of Baragaon, Barabanki with roots in landed aristocracy, he remained the go-to person for scholars with an interest in the region’s culture and history. Saleem bhai’s sensitive persona as well as his home reflected an old-world charm that is fast getting extinct and cast into oblivion. Some people felt that Saleem bhai remained reserved, a trait often associated with academic arrogance. The fact remains that he never shunned people but did expect a certain purity of thought in people he opened up to.  His demeanour reflected the catholicity of a researcher and he was quite friendly with people who could relate to his cultural rootedness and scholastic acumen. After his professorial stint with the University of Delhi’s Ramjas College, Saleem bhai’s body of work as a translator from Urdu to English was outstanding, including Malika Pukhraj's autobiography ‘Song Sung True’, ‘The Mirror of Wonders’ by Syed Rafiq Hussain, Quratulain Hyder’s ‘Chandni Begum’ and ‘Safina-e-Gham-e-Dil’. He wrote some very interesting books, including ‘Islam, America and South Asia’. Saleem Kidwai was among the first few academics in India to publicly speak on gay rights and also actively wrote in what was considered taboo in the country. He co-edited a series of books ‘Same-sex Love in India’ with Ruth Vanita. He exemplified Carol Hanisch’s idea that ‘the personal is political’. In addition to his steadfast support to causes including the abolition of Section 377, Saleem bhai was frank in sharing his experience as a member of the LGBT community — a source of courage and self-respect for many. Saleem Kidwai had an academic interest in the history of the tawaifs, the courtesan singers. He also shared a very special bond with the legendary singer Begum Akhtar. His pro-active efforts, supported by Shanti Hiranand, rescued Begum’s mazaar in Lucknow’s Thakurganj from obscurity as the Sadbhavana Trust and Sanatkada led its conservation. Saleem Kidwai last visit to my home was on March 14, 2020, just before the lockdown, along with the author Veena Oldenburg. Those three golden hours just melted away as we reminisced the forgotten Lucknow of yesteryears. I vividly recollect another delightful evening at my home a few years ago with him, Rosie Llewellyn-Jones and Ram Advani; and yet another with the actor Farooque Shaikh at Saleem Bhai’s tasteful home. The list is endless. I loved Saleem bhai’s brilliant translation of ‘Chandni Begum’ in English and published a book review in 2017. His eyes used to light up while discussing the life and times of Begum Akhtar. We last interacted on August 11 this year, just a few days before he passed away. There are numerous memories which now stand frozen in time, almost fossilised. Lucknow has lost one of its finest gems. Rest in peace Saleem bhai. The writer heads the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) in UP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/saleem-kidwai-leaves-behind-a-soulful-legacy/articleshow/85817911.cms||---
---||Amritsar||Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee Navjot Singh Sidhu picks tweet route to keep gap||AMRITSAR: Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) president Navjot Singh Sidhu still seems to be dependent on Twitter to put his views across to chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, instead of taking issues up with him directly. For experts, Sidhu seems to be deliberately using Twitter, so that he could distance himself from what he describes as failures of the Congress government in Punjab. Sidhu’s tweets on Saturday, referenced to power tariff for consumers and termination of power purchase agreements (PPAs), only reinforced the differences between him and Amarinder on taking decisions on vital issues. Political analyst Prof Kuldeep Singh said for Sidhu, who has a large followership on Twitter, it was more important to communicate with followers than the chief minister. He said it seemed like Sidhu saw himself as the chief minister face of the Congress for 2022 assembly elections. “Everyone knows that Sidhu is not on good terms with the CM. He wants the same to be known to the people of Punjab. If he somehow develops a good equation with Amarinder and in the process forgets the issues he has been raising against him, his voice of dissent would be lost, which he doesn’t want,” he said. There is a stark difference in the views of urban, educated voters and rural or common voters on Sidhu going on with his Twitter battle despite party high command mollifying some of his grouses by elevating his position in the state Congress unit. While the former are of the view that Sidhu’s outbursts on Twitter were improper and unprofessional, the latter view it as their own success and they react with clichés like “dekha, chak dae phatae” and “thok-ta Captain”. “With the target of being a chief minister face in 2022 elections, the most important for Sidhu is how his performance as PPCC president is popularly viewed. Keep this rebellion face alive is the political necessity for Sidhu since he has always been projecting that he is not part of the non-performance of Amarinder government,” said Kuldeep A leader of the Congress, who didn’t wish to give his name for obvious reasons, said rifts in the party had become more obvious due to Sidhu. He was of the view that Sidhu being a PPCC chief should avoid going public with his resentments and instead use a proper platform to raise them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/sidhu-picks-tweet-route-to-keep-gap/articleshow/85817920.cms||Yudhvir Rana
---||Delhi||Heavy rain takes Delhi down the same road||NEW DELHI: There was the perennial question for Delhiites once again on Tuesday — is a good downpour a boon or a bane? The usual waterlogging and the resultant traffic snarls always takes away the pleasure of a vigorous shower for thirsty Delhi and it was no different on Tuesday, when the morning rains caused arterial roads to be inundated and traffic to move at snail’s pace. To civic officials’ satisfaction, Minto Bridge remained unaffected, but the underpass at Pul Prahladpur, which is the new symbol of the capital’s clogged stormwater drain system, went under for the umpteenth time this monsoon. Important arteries like SP Marg, Moti Lal Nehru Marg, Maulana Azad Road near Vigyan Bhawan, Shahjahan Road, W Point at ITO, Lala Lajpat Rai Marg, Moolchand underpass and the AIIMS flyover were flooded and considerably slowed down vehicular movement. Traffic congestion was reported from many other places in the city too. TimesViewWaterlogging has become a depressingly regular fallout of heavy rain in the capital. On Tuesday, thousands of commuters again suffered due to overflowing drains. This state of affairs is a telling commentary on the inefficiency of civic bodies. Higher authorities must take notice of this recurring mess and hammer out a permanent solution to the problem.The traffic police remained busy through the day guiding commuters away from submerged routes. The trouble spots included the Ring Road stretch near Hyatt Regency, Savitri Cinema flyover, Maharani Bagh, Nizamuddin, Anand Parbat and from Dhaula Kuan to Gyarah Murti. With Pul Prahladpur flooded, a traffic diversion was created on Mehrauli-Badarpur Road with Lal Kuan Marg and Maa Anandmayee Marg taking the additional load. While a building partially collapsed near Sainik Farms. South Delhi Municipal Corporation reported trees falling in S block of Greater Kailash II, Khel Gaon, Chhatarpur, Saket, Mandakini Enclave, Katwariya Sarai, Pul Prahladpur, F block in Jangpura Extension and Kalkaji. The civic body received waterlogging complaints mostly from its south and central zone, including Maharani Bagh, Defence Colony, Jangpura Extension, Gaffar Manzil and Garhi village, but none from its Najafgarh and west zones. EDMC reported only two waterlogging complaints from Surajmal Vihar and Vigyan Lok, but the ground situation was quite different. Delhiites took to social media to criticise the management of the drainage system, with derisive remarks about the new swimming pools and waterfalls in the city. The capital's ageing drainage system can handle just 50mm of rainfall in a day and Tuesday’s heavy downpour tested it to its leaky seams.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/heavy-rain-takes-city-down-the-same-road/articleshow/85815784.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Consumers say MSEDCL must give 40% subsidy on solar rooftop panels||MUMBAI: Power consumers, especially those from housing societies in Navi Mumbai and Thane, have demanded that MSEDCL avail of Central subsidy up to 40% on solar rooftop panel installations, which it can pass on to consumers who can then save Rs 800-2,400 in bills every month. Last week, BEST, Adani Electricity and Tata Power announced this scheme for their consumers in Mumbai. The subsidy is an initiative of the Union ministry of renewable energy and is being availed by most states. However, MSEDCL, which supplies electricity to the largest base of consumers – over 2.6 crores in Maharashtra – is yet to avail of the subsidy. TimesViewThe subsidy scheme from the Centre on solar panel installations should be transparent and consumer-friendly. Power utilities should give adequate time to residential users to raise capital and make an informed decision rather than provide a hurried first-come-first-serve option. Government should ensure maximum people benefit from a scheme which encourages clean energy to be harnessed. Since it is a new concept, many consumers may need to be guided.P K Abraham, a resident of a Vashi housing society, told TOI that majority in his building were willing to opt for solar power, which could reduce power bills. “But it is sad that MSEDCL is yet to come out with its plan,” he said. He said the scheme should be open for at least “2 years for the public to weigh and wake up to the initiative.” In the case of Adani, the scheme ends by December. When contacted, a senior MSEDCL official said on Monday, “We were planning to go ahead with the subsidy scheme but have kept the decision on hold for some time. We are still discussing, examining how we can implement this scheme for a huge customer base of over 2.6 crore across Maharashtra. We will make an announcement as and when we are ready.” Chairman and managing director of MSEDCL Vijay Singhal is believed to have told regional offices to offer the scheme to consumers. Residential consumers can opt for a minimum 1 kilowatt peak (kWp) solar panel, which will generate 1,400-1,500 units annually. “This comes to an average 125 units per month. There will be a metering system, wherein whatever solar power you generate goes to the grid. And this is adjusted with your monthly electricity bill,” said an Adani official. For instance, if you generated 125 units in solar power in a month, and consumed 300 units a month, you pay for 175 units (300 minus 125). Savings could be Rs 800-Rs 2,400 a month, depending on 1-3 kWp of solar panel installed. For 1 kWp, the actual cost is Rs 46,000, but 40% subsidy reduces it to Rs 27,600, all inclusive of GST, and related costs such as supply, installation, testing, commissioning and a comprehensive 5-year maintenance.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-consumers-say-msedcl-must-give-40-subsidy-on-solar-rooftop-panels/articleshow/85818959.cms||Somit Sen

The hospital is observing ‘national eye donation fortnight 2021’ between August 25 and September 8. They noted that awareness was needed among donors and recipients as the hospital has found it difficult to find patients to receive the donated eyes. In 2020, as many as 452 enucleations of eyes, a surgical procedure to remove the entire globe and intraocular contents in the eye, were performed at GRH. However, the number of people who underwent keratoplasty or cornea transplant at the hospital were 47. However, the numbers are higher than the previous year in both cases. “Awareness about eye donation has increased nowadays with many coming forward to pledge to donate the eyes. Through our cornea retrieval programme, we continue to have counselors interact with families of deceased patients and have them donate eyes. On the other hand, we are also getting fewer patients to get corneal transplants,” said U Vijaya Shanmugam, head, department of ophthalmology, GRH. The doctor further said that there were a number of reasons for it, including the availability and accessibility for corneal transplants, which is being done at a number of hospitals. Now with advanced medical treatment available, many are not requiring transplants. Dr Rajeshwari, who runs the cornea clinic at GRH, said that the retrieved cornea can be stored safely in the eye bank and if they were excess in numbers, it is also given to other hospitals or eye banks in nearby districts. “We assess the damage done to the cornea and decide on whether the patient requires a cornea transplant. Through surgery, the damaged cornea tissue is removed and replaced to restore vision. Unlike in the case of other organs, anyone’s cornea can be transplanted to any person after virological testing,” she said. Dr Vijaya Shanmugam further said that the hospital is also set to start sutureless keratoplasty or corneal transplantation, which is more targeted and less invasive. On Tuesday, an exhibition to create awareness about eye donation was inaugurated at GRH and a slew of awareness activities have been planned for the week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/grh-struggles-to-find-recipients-of-donated-eyes/articleshow/85815686.cms||Sukshma Ramakrishnan
---||Surat||Surat: Organs of 2 friends who died in accident save 13 lives||SURAT: As kids, these bosom friends were inseparable and went on to study together up to Class XII. Such was their bonding that even death could not separate them. But Meet Pandya (18) and Krish Gandhi (19) have immortalized themselves by giving life to at least 13 people with their organs. On August 24, Meet and Krish were riding a bike when a speeding vehicle hit them from behind near GD Goenka School. They were rushed to hospital but both had suffered brain haemorrhage and doctors declared them brain dead on August 28. “As soon as we were informed about the two brain-dead boys, we reached the hospital and met their grieving family members. Even in this time of immense tragedy, parents of both boys agreed to donate their vital organs for the sake of needy patients,” said Nilesh Mandlewala, founder president, Donate Life, a voluntary organization working for organ donation. Four kidneys, two livers, one heart, two lungs and four corneas were donated. The kidneys of both boys were allocated to Ahmedabad-based Institute of Kidney Diseases and Research Centre (IKDRC) while the corneas were donated to Surat-based Lok Dristi Eye Bank. Meet's kidneys were transplanted into two siblings - one 13 years old and another 14 year old - at IKDRC while Krish's one kidney was transplanted into a 54-year-old man from Amreli and another into a 45-year-old man from Mehsana. ‘Organs to keep memories alive’Meet's liver was transplanted into a 47-year-old teacher from Bayad town of Sabarkantha district. The heart was transplanted into a 21-year-old girl from Vadodara while the corneas were donated to Surat-based Lok Drishti Eye Bank. Krish's lungs were transplanted into a 54-year-old Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) jawan in Hyderabad. The jawan had been living on oxygen support for the last one-and-a-half year, awaiting lung transplant. Krish's liver was transplanted into a 55-year-old man from Rajkot in an Ahmedabad hospital. Meet's father Kalpesh has a catering business in Rustampura area while Krish's father Sanjay runs a snacks cart in Begampura in Surat. "Meet was bright in studies and wanted to make a career in information technology. Though it's a tragic loss, we have to come to terms with his untimely demise. However, we will seem to be living through his organs in those patients who will get new lives,'' Kalpesh Pandya said. Sanjay Gandhi said, “We are a poor family and can’t donate anything to help the society. It was not his age to leave us behind but the bitter reality is that he is dead. His vital organs can give new life to someone, so we decided on organ donation. Mandlewala said this was the first case in the state where as many as 13 organs and tissues were donated and transplanted at one go and lives of many organ failure patients' were saved. Four green corridors were created to transport lungs, heart, livers and kidneys to four different destination hospitals in Hyderabad and Ahmedabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/organs-of-two-friends-who-died-in-accident-save-13-lives/articleshow/85813483.cms||Vijaysinh Parmar
---||Kochi||Centre appoints KAT chief after high court rap||Kochi: The Union government on Tuesday notified the appointment of Justice CK Abdul Rehim, former judge of the Kerala High Court, as the chairperson of Kerala Administrative Tribunal (KAT). His appointment came a week after the high court criticized the delay on the part of the Union government in making the appointment. After considering a contempt of court petition filed by the advocates association as an order to fill the post was not implemented, a division bench had severely criticized the Union government on August 24 and had asked it to show some respect to court orders. How will an ordinary citizen respect the court when the government fails to do so, the court had asked. The post of KAT chairperson has been lying vacant since September 15 last year. In addition to criticizing the government, the court had also issued notices to cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba IAS and Deepak Khandekar IAS, secretary of Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT).

Girish Chodankar, who has been retained as the party president, reposed the same faith in the nine block presidents. The nine blocks, whose presidents have been reappointed include the constituencies of Margao, Saligao, St Cruz, Aldona and Cuncolim. “They are working well and there was no need to change them,” said Congress vice-president M K Shaikh. The disbanding of the party blocks, which was announced on August 27, is part of a restructuring effort. The block presidents of the constituencies will be announced within the next 25 days, said Congress officials. “These appointments have been made with the concurrence of AICC Goa desk in-charge, Dinesh Gundu Rao and other AICC observers,” Shaikh said. Atul Naik has been reappointed as Saligao block president. Assis Noronha, who is close to Joaquim Alemao, has made a comeback as the Cuncolim block president. In Canacona, Quepem and Curchorem, Pralay Bhagat, Avadoot Amonkar and Pushkal Sawant have been reappointed. Shushant Govekar has been given charge of St Cruz, Ashwin D’Souza returns as the Aldona block president. Margao and Nuvem block presidents are Gopal Naik and Manuel D’Costa respectively. AICC disbanded the blocks and districts as most of the workers were either inactive or reluctant to work with some of the party leaders. During his recent visit, AICC senior election observer and former Union finance minister P Chidambaram said that only active party workers will be consulted and rewarded. “This is a chance for Girish Chodankar to strengthen his grip on the party workers. He can now put his stamp on the blocks,” said a party spokesperson. On Monday, AICC put an end to year-long speculations and said that Chodankar will continue as the Goa Congress president. AICC also accommodated senior party leaders who were angling for the president’s post by assigning key responsibilities to them.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/congress-reappoints-block-presidents-for-9-constituencies/articleshow/85815791.cms||---

Against this backdrop, these personnel will be trained,” said Akhilesh Singh, DIG and head RAPO. After a week-long training, these Army personnel will further augment the Army’s capabilities in their respective regiments. Interestingly, the training modules also include the study of international cases, like the Capitol Hill siege in the US that took place in 2020 and the Yellow Vests Movement case of France that took place in late 2018 and early 2019, to give them a bit of international exposure. Speaking to TOI, deputy commandant, RAPO, Harish Negi said, “The course will also include ammunition handling, fire-fighting techniques, introduction to special equipment and use of vehicles and mock drills.” This is, however, not the first time when an Army contingent is being trained at RAPO. In 2019, 15 jawans of the Kumaon Battalion were trained for controlling riots.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/raf-provides-training-to-army-personnel-on-riots-controlling-with-un-peace-missions-in-mind/articleshow/85806883.cms||Sandeep Rai

Since the centre started functioning 24x7, there has been good response from public even during night time. As the district administration and health department authorities is actively taking efforts to create awareness and holding special vaccination camps, currently, around 20,000 beneficiaries are getting the jab daily. “More than 10,000 beneficiaries get the jab in rural areas alone in a day. Many special camps are also being organized for school teachers, traders, disabled people etc., as well to make Covid-19 vaccination more accessible,” said Dr S Senthil Kumar, deputy director of health services, Madurai. The health official added that they are aiming to improve the vaccination numbers further. On Tuesday, a special Covid-19 vaccination camp was organized by Madurai Corporation and a private taxi service at a private hospital near Ellis Nagar.

Elated over his second son’s feat, Surendra Singh said it was the God’s grace and attributed the success to Sharad’s determination to scale new heights in life. There was also a festive mood at Sharad’s native village Kodarkatta Puran under Motipur block in Muzaffarpur district on Tuesday. The villagers distributed sweets and exchanged greetings soon after the news broke about the son of the soil winning a bronze medal at the Paralympics. Recalling the incident, Surendra said a spurious vaccine had caused polio attack in Sharad’s left leg. However, it took years to get rid of that. “Thank God that he finally got over it. And today he delivered what we had expected from him,” he said. He said Sharad was a bit upset after suffering injury in his leg ahead of his event at Tokyo. But he recited the shlokas of the Bhagwat Geeta to regain strength and determination to perform well today, a visibly delighted Surendra said. Sharad was good at studies since his childhood. He was sent to St. Paul’s School at Darjeeling at the age of three and a half years. Initially he had keen interest in cricket and then in athletics. “While playing with his schoolmates at Darjeeling, he developed keen interest in high jump. Later, he was appreciated by the school authorities for his outstanding performance as an athlete despite having physical disability. Since then, he never looked back. “Being a good student and an excellent sportsperson is a rare combination,” Surendra, who lives at his Exhibition Road residence in Patna, told this newspaper over phone on Tuesday. The family was celebrating Sharad’s success as calls poured in to congratulate them. After doing graduation in political science from Karori Mal College, Delhi, Sharad did his postgraduation from Jawahar Lal Nehru University (JNU). A delighted Sharad’s mother, Kumkum Kumari, said, “Mein bahut khush hun. Bete ne desh ka naam roshan kiya hai (I am very happy. My son has earned laurels for the country),” she said. Sharad’s elder brother Sanat Kumar is a practising lawyer in the Supreme Court while his younger sister Aditi Shruti has just cleared the Bihar Public Service Commission examinations. “We have shifted to Patna from native village to provide best education to my children,” a proud Surendra said. Sharad underwent training in Ukraine for the event. The family said he had been staying with his elder brother in Delhi for the last three months. “We didn’t ask him to come to Patna during the pandemic,” Surendra said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/muz-man-overcomes-odds-to-win-paralympics-bronze/articleshow/85815756.cms||Ramashankar

---||Delhi||Delhi: Dwarka’s seven-year wait for hospital to end||NEW DELHI: In some good news for residents of Dwarka and adjoining areas, Delhi government’s Indira Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital, construction of which started in 2014, is likely to be thrown open to the public in September. The hospital was partially opened as a 250-bed Covid hospital in May. While the super specialty hospital was originally planned as a 750-bedded hospital, the Aam Aadmi Party government decided to increase its capacity to 1,241 beds, which also resulted in more time being taken to make the hospital ready. Sources said some finishing work remains to be completed. While construction of the super specialty hospital was still underway in May, Delhi government turned it into a 250-bedded Covid care centre to augment the infrastructure required to deal with the relentless surge of infections. The same month, Delhi High Court questioned the state government on why it hadn’t operationalised the centre despite assurances. The government's affidavit pleaded that its use as a Covid facility had delayed its operationalisation. Dwarka residents have been running an online campaign to have the hospital project start functioning. The medical facility will not only cater to residents of the sub-city, which doesn’t have any government hospital at present, but also the residents of many localities in southwest Delhi. Indira Gandhi Hospital has been in the pipeline for more than two decades after the land for its construction was allotted in 1997 and Rs 350 crore was set aside for the project in 2007. The construction work, however, could only start in 2014. The hospital will be air-conditioned and will have provisions for piped oxygen for every bed. The hospital will also get an oxygen storage tank soon. The medical hub will have departments for medicine, skin conditions, ENT, ophthalmology, nephrology and radiology, among others, apart from an intensive care unit, physiotherapy lab and a blood bank. The hospital complex was earlier planned over an area of 15 acres, but the premises were later expanded to over 24 acres. Apart from the three main sections, namely emergency, out-patient department and hospital wards, there are also plans to start a medical college on the complex. Sources said space and provisions had been kept aside for future expansion of the facility. Although provisions have been made for 1,241 beds, sources said there is space to double the number of beds if required. While the planned beds will all be oxygenated, additional beds will be provided with oxygen concentrators. The physical infrastructure has been nearly ready for the past few months. However, finding adequate healthcare professionals and other manpower to manage a super specialty hospital has been a challenge, sources said. In a circular issued late last year, Delhi government’s health department stated that it intended to post willing staff in three new Delhi government hospitals at Burari, Ambedkar Nagar and Dwarka and invited requests from doctors, nurses and paramedics for posting at these new medical centres. Last year, Delhi government inaugurated a 700-bed hospital in Burari and a 600-bedded hospital in Ambedkar Nagar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dwarkas-7-yr-wait-for-hospital-to-end/articleshow/85815751.cms||Sidharatha Roy

Probe into a separate case involving actor Arman Kohli led to these arrests. Kohli was arrested based on the interrogation of arrested drug peddler Ajay Singh alias Mamu, who revealed the role of accused Imran Ansari in purchasing drugs. Later, a Nigerian, Uba Chinoso Wizdom, was held from Nalasopara and commercial quantity of mephedrone seized. “He was the main supplier of mephedrone in this case,” said Sameer Wankhede, zonal director, NCB. Subsequently, Nwachiyaso Israel Nwachukwu alias Sam was intercepted with cocaine at Aarey Milk Colony on Tuesday. Sam has been staying in the city for the last five years. “He was the main trafficker of this international link as the cocaine seized is of South American origin,” added Wankhede. Another African drug cartel was also busted and a Nigerian national, Sunday Okeki alias Sunny, was arrested from Nalasopara on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbaincb-cracks-down-on-drug-cartels-in-city-six-arrested/articleshow/85818021.cms||Mateen Hafeez
---||Lucknow||HC overturns order on police hiring eligibility||Lucknow: The Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court has overturned the verdict of a single judge bench holding that B.Tech (Computer Science), B.Sc (Computer Science) or BCA is equivalent to NIELIT (DOEACC) ‘O’ Level certificate. The order came as a setback for candidates who had applied for 136 posts of sub-inspector (confidential), 303 posts of assistant sub-inspector (ministerial) and 170 posts of assistant sub-inspector (accounts) in UP Police pursuant to December 26, 2016, advertisement. Pronouncing the judgment, the division bench of Justice Ritu Raj Awasthi and Justice Dinesh Kumar Singh said, “Once the statutory rules prescribe for having ‘O’ Level certificate from a particular institute, the single bench could not substitute its own view, by exercising judicial review, to hold that the higher qualification would certainly include the ‘O’ Level certificate issued by DOEACC/NIELIT.” “We, therefore, hold that the Single Judge has wrongly held that higher qualification held by the respondent candidates would be inclusive of ‘O’ Level certificate and, hence, the finding that the respondent candidates met the essential eligibility condition, is not correct,” the bench observed. Additional chief standing counsel Uday Veer Singh pleaded that the single bench order of March 26, 2021 was against the findings of other benches which had held that if a particular qualification was required in an advertisement, the courts cannot substitute or add to such qualification. Earlier, the candidates had pleaded that since they had higher level of education than prescribed in advertisement, they should be permitted for selection. The single bench had accepted their plea, but the division bench overturned it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/hc-overturns-order-on-police-hiring-eligibility/articleshow/85817979.cms||Ravi Singh Sisodiya
---||Delhi||Delhi: Back to classes at DTU, Ambedkar University today||NEW DELHI: Delhi Technological University (DTU) and Ambedkar University Delhi (AUD) will be reopening their campuses from Wednesday. DTU has decided to first call PhD students and final-year postgraduate and undergraduate students only for practicals and project work. AUD will be starting with the final-year UG, PG, MPhil and PhD students. Most coaching institutes, however, have decided to defer the reopening this week. They said they had to readjust the online and offline classes, complete vaccination of staff members and work on logistics to ensure a gap between two classes. Anu Lather, Ambedkar University Delhi vice-chancellor, said, “I held meetings with the dean, directors and administrative officers. We have decided to call the final-year UG, PG and MPhil/PhD students with 50% seating in each session. In mid-September, there will be a review and a decision will be made for students of other years.”  Delhi Technological University vice-chancellor Yogesh Singh said, “From Wednesday, we have decided to call only final-year students for project and practical work.” Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University said they were waiting for a government directive, but a decision on reopening had been made. Vice-chancellor Mahesh Verma said, “We will start with PhD scholars, followed by PG students. As UG students are more in number, they will be called later in phases.” Delhi University could not hold the meeting on Tuesday due to an executive council meeting. Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), however, said meetings were going on. Most private schools would not be reopening on Wednesday. Most government schools, however, said they would be starting as information had been sent to the students. “We will be starting classes tomorrow. Messages have been sent to the children through the class WhatsApp group,” said BK Sharma, principal of Shaheed Hemu Kalani Sarvodaya Vidyalaya, Lajpat Nagar. Keshav Agarwal, president of Educators Society, an association of 300 coaching centres, said, “It’s a bit of a fix for us and we will take time to reopen while following norms. We are finalising the consent form and from tomorrow we will start mailing it to parents. We also have to arrange for extra staff for managing crowds, conducting thermal scans, vaccination, among other things.” “Students are scattered across the entire country, so we will continue with online classes. It’s difficult to change in the middle of a session,” said a coaching centre owner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/back-to-classes-at-dtu-ambedkar-univ-today/articleshow/85815772.cms||Shradha Chettri

AMC Kalpita Pimple spoke to a section of media on Tuesday, and reiterated that she does not fear such attacks. A senior police officer said the AMC is under medical observation for 48 hours post reconstruction surgery of her fingers. Accused Amarjeet Yadav, who was arrested for attacking her and chopping off her fingers, was produced in the magistrate’s court and remanded to police custody till Saturday. Politicians from various parties condemned the attack. Guardian minister Eknath Shinde, who met the victims, said the civic body will bear the cost of treatment, and that police has been directed to take strictest action against the accused.

---||Nagpur||Cong lists BJP’s failures in NMC, targets Gadkari||Nagpur: The city Congress unit, which has been keeping a low-profile for some years now, is gearing up for defeating BJP in next year’s municipal corporation’s polls under the leadership of MPCC president Nana Patole. In the last seven years since the NDA government came to power under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, hardly anyone dared to utter a single word against Nitin Gadkari, who was elevated as a Union minister. Congress city chief Vikas Thakre, MLC Abhijit Wanjari, Vishal Muttemwar and others on Tuesday specifically targeted the BJP heavyweight over failure of various projects like Nag River rejuvenation, 24x7 water supply, Smart City, London (orange) Street and Scania buses that used to run on ethanol, among others, alleging slow pace of work and massive corruption. “BJP has destroyed the city with its misrule in the last 15 years. Now, even its own leaders are acknowledging the same. The people are disappointed with their poor administration and are ready to teach them a befitting lesson in every election. Its proof came when Abhijit Wanjari crushed former mayor Sandip Joshi in the graduates’ constituency polls, where Congress never won in nearly six decades. Despite their government at the Centre and state in 2014-19, they have miserably failed to develop the city,” Thakre said, pointing out that Mihan failed to take off till date. Wanjari alleged massive corruption in awarding a contract for inner ring road where the entire stretch of 47km was in a shambles. “The Rs265 crore project is full of potholes due to inferior construction quality. The Central Road Research Institute (CRRI) had passed strictures on the work quality. The contract was awarded to a firm blacklisted by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). Even former BJP MLA Sudhakar Kohale had complained about corruption in the project.” Pointing out NHAI’s failure to complete Pardi flyover for over seven years, the MLC added that NMC was granting favours to the contractor. “We want an inquiry into the affairs as despite the death of seven children at the spot, no action was taken against the contractor,” he said. Claiming that many projects initiated by NMC turned out to be a big failure, Muttemwar said those were implemented without conducting the feasibility and viability study. “Some like Scania and waste-to-energy project initiated on Gadkari’s behest were forced to shut down due to non-viability and even the Nag river project is going to meet the same fate. It led to loss of precious public money,” he said. “The Scania company has filed an arbitration demanding compensation from NMC, which would be paid from its general funds. Even Essel Infrastructure, a Zee Group’s venture, left the waste-to-energy project midway last year, terming it as unviable. NMC failed to forfeit its Rs5 crore bank guarantee and the firm had withdrawn it,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cong-lists-bjps-failures-in-nmc-targets-gadkari/articleshow/85815838.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Delhi||Delhi gets 1.2 lakh streetlights in 2 years; next target 2.1 lakh||NEW DELHI: Under Mukhyamantri Street Light scheme, Delhi government has installed about 1.2 lakh streetlights since September 2019 when the scheme was launched to make the capital free of dark spots. The scheme is aimed at addressing concerns of women safety, and under it, 2.1 lakh streetlights will be installed in the capital. According to information submitted in the Delhi assembly, three private companies have been outsourced the job. According to the response submitted in the Delhi assembly by the power department, streetlights are being installed across the capital, excluding areas falling under unauthorised colonies. The streetlights will be wall-mounted and the urban development department has prepared a standard operating procedure for the purpose. Each of the three companies is supposed to install 70,000 streetlights. The three companies have, respectively, installed 30,080, 19,113 and 68,121 wall-mounted streetlights so far. The urban development department has so far sanctioned Rs 45 crore for the project and more funds are likely to be released for it soon. The power companies installing the streetlights have informed the government that the remaining streetlights will be installed when the government releases the remaining funds. With just 1.17 lakh streetlights being installed in the city till now, only around 55% of the total work has been completed and a major chunk of the work remains to be done. The Delhi cabinet had in 2018 approved a proposal for a safety audit of the capital by a private agency. The survey of public spaces was conducted using two apps and the survey included factors like streetlighting, presence of pedestrians around, condition of footpaths, availability of public transport and how one feels at the spot. The survey identified hundreds of dark spots which women found unsafe. The places mapped by the survey were the first to get the streetlights under the scheme that was launched by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal towards the end of 2019. The installation of streetlights began on a war footing after the survey, but the work was later hit due to model code of conduct being imposed in the capital when the election commission announced general election for Delhi assembly.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-gets-1-2l-streetlights-in-2-years-next-target-2-1l/articleshow/85815826.cms||---

A bench of Justice Ramesh Sinha and Justice Saroj Yadav passed the order on the petition filed by Kushwaha, who had sought quashing of FIR saying the probe has not concluded even after seven years and that there was no material for implicating him in the case. In its order, the bench said, “Considering the allegations in the FIR and material brought on record, it cannot be said that no prima facie case is made out against the petitioner, rather, there appears to be sufficient ground for investigation. Accordingly, we do not find any justification to quash the impugned FIR.” On plea that investigation is lingering and keeping the sword hanging on him endlessly, the bench said, “We direct the investigating officer to conclude the investigation and file report before the court concerned, in accordance with law, expeditiously preferably within a period of four weeks from the date of production of a certified copy of this order.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/rs-1-4k-cr-monument-scam-hc-refuses-to-quash-fir-against-ex-min-kushwaha/articleshow/85818010.cms||Ravi Singh Sisodiya
---||Pune||Stray dogs trouble residents in Pune Cantonment||PUNE: Several residents, particularly joggers and morning walkers, have complained about the menace of stray dogs in and around the military and residential areas of Pune Cantonment. A pack of dogs chasing joggers/morning walkers in areas like the race course is a common grievance although no incidence of dog bite has been reported in the recent past. Many residents have written to the Pune Cantonment Board (PCB) seeking steps to address the problem on priority. The PCB does not have a mechanism of its own or an agency to deal with the problem. In the past, nine attempts to hire an agency through a bidding process found no takers. The board had earlier roped in an NGO for the task, but its contract lapsed in 2018. Amit Kumar, chief executive officer, PCB, told TOI, “Only one agency has responded to our recent tender notice for dog management. We will discuss this issue at the upcoming general body meeting.” “A number of stray dogs running loose are causing a menace within the institute’s premises and posing a serious threat to the safety of the troops, families and children staying in the area,” stated the letter written by the Army Institute of Physical Training authorities to the PCB. Similarly, the Command Hospital has also raised the issue, “There has been a tremendous increase in the number of stray dogs/cats in and around the hospital complex, which is creating a lot of inconvenience to patients and unit personnel.” The Station Cell of the Dakshin Maharashtra and Goa Sub Area, which deals with civic issues with respect to the military areas in the cantonment, has been sterilising stray dogs with the help of NGOs. “The cell has been taking multiple steps to control their breeding process, but citizens also need to be aware about stray dogs and their behaviour pattern. They also need to remain alert. These dogs are mainly found in areas where garbage is not lifted properly. These locations have become feeding points for them,” said a senior army officer. Sanjay Kawade, a resident and activist of Ghorpadi, said, “The board must take concrete steps to control this menace. At some locations, these dogs chase bikers in the night.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/stray-dogs-trouble-residents-in-pune-cantonment/articleshow/85815794.cms||Sandip Dighe
---||Pune||Subsidy for residential users to opt for rooftop solar power||PUNE: The Union government is providing a 40% subsidy to residential consumers and 20% subsidy to group housing societies and residential welfare associations to install rooftop solar systems, a statement issued by Maharashtra state electricity distribution company ltd (MSEDCL) said. The installation of a rooftop solar system will lead to huge savings in monthly household electricity bills, while the remaining electricity will also be purchased by MSEDCL at the end of each financial year through net metering arrangement. Chairman and managing director of MSEDCL Vijay Singhal has told regional offices to provide advantage of this scheme to consumers. A target of 25MW has been sanctioned for MSEDCL under Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) Phase-II scheme. Under this scheme, central financial assistance will be provided by the Centre for installation of rooftop solar system of at least 1KW capacity to residential category consumers — 40% subsidy for 1-3KW and 20% for 3-10KW. Consumers of group housing society and residential welfare association will also get a 20% subsidy for common facilities up to 500KW, with a limit of 10KW per house. MSEDCL has empanelled zone-wise agencies to set up rooftop solar systems. The list of empanelled agencies and online application facility is available on MSEDCL website ‘www.mahadiscom.in’. With the installation of a 1KW rooftop solar system, customers who consume up to 100 units per month can save up to Rs 550 as per the current tariff. Also, through the net metering arrangement, the unutilized units will be purchased by MSEDCL at the end of each financial year. It will also benefit residential consumers financially. At the same time, the payback period on investment for such system will be about 3 to 5 years. Suhas Patwardhan of the Pune District Cooperative Housing Federation said that the decision will benefit the housing societies. He however said financial aid in addition to the subisdy would go a long way in convincing people. “A soft loan system could ensure better implementation as investment in a solar power system is still a costly affair, and housing societies could face challenges in raising funds. Citizens are willing, it just requires some support from the government,” Patwardhan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/subsidy-for-residential-users-to-opt-for-rooftop-solar-power/articleshow/85815823.cms||---

Track the pollution level in your cityIn terms of average Air Quality Index (AQI), Delhi fared the worse this August than 2020 and 2019, but better than 2018. The average AQI this August was 107 as against 64 in 2020, 87 in 2019 and 112 in 2018. Though the city recorded two “heavy” rainfall days this month, experts said rainfall pattern, high dust concentration and other local emission sources played an important role. An AQI between below 50 is classified as “good”, between 51 and 100 as “satisfactory” and between 101 and 200 as “moderate”. “Poor” air ranges from 201 to 300, “very poor” from 301 to 400 and “severe” from 401 to 500. In August last year, the highest AQI was 87 and no “moderate” day was witnessed. However, 21 “moderate” air quality days were reported in August this year. According to India Meteorological Department’s data, 10 rainy days were recorded in August this year against 15 and 16 rainy days in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Though August 2018 saw 19 rainy days, experts said some days recorded very light to light rainfall and pollutants remained in the air. Experts said the prominent pollutant in the last week of August this year was PM10, suggesting high concentration of dust in the air. Dipankar Saha, former head at CPCB’s air laboratory, said, “Rain played a key role in August this year. As fewer rainy days were observed, the top soil was not wet enough to settle down the pollutants.” Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment, said, “The city saw more dry spells this August than in the past two years. Due to a longer dry spell this time, the particulate levels were higher. The impact of local sources should also be investigated.” LS Kurinji, programme associate, Council on Energy, Environment and Water, said, “Data from the Safdarjung weather station indicates that Delhi witnessed less rainy days in August this year compared with 2020. Further, a rise in activity levels was witnessed owing to the economic reopening. Google mobility trends showed the number of trips for retail and recreation purposes and work almost doubled in August 2021 compared with last year.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/this-august-was-more-polluted-than-last-two/articleshow/85815880.cms||Priyangi Agarwal

In the divorce petition submitted at Kozhikode Family Court, Shaju cited the alleged, cruel mindset of Jolly to seek a divorce. The family court will consider the divorce petition on Oct 26. He said that he didn’t have doubts about Jolly’s hand in the killings of Ponnamattom family members, who were related to him, between 2002 and 2016. He added at the time of his marriage with Jolly in Feb 2017 and even before that Jolly had made him believe that she was an assistant professor at NIT, Calicut. He also said that Jolly had tried to make him co-accused in the case by giving false statements before the police during collection of evidence. "The petitioner escaped from being killed by sheer luck and the continuation of the marriage with the defendant who is having a particular state of mind would put his life in danger," the petition said. Jolly was arrested in Oct 2019 in connection with six deaths in her family which allegedly turned out to be serial killings. She had allegedly killed her first husband Roy Thomas, Shaju’s wife Sily and his daughter Alphine (2). According to the FIR, Jolly is also accused of murdering Roy’s parents Tom and Annamma Thomas and Annama’s brother Mathew Manjadiyil.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/koodathayi-case-jollys-husband-seeks-divorce/articleshow/85815894.cms||---

Senior inspector Murlidhar Karpe on Tuesday said that the woman, in her complaint, stated that her daughter left home on August 28 to collect her SSC exam marksheet from school. “The suspect accosted the girl outside a hotel and lured her to accompany him for sightseeing and drove her on a bike to various places in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad and molested her,” stated the woman’s complaint.

The victim sustained a bleeding injury on her throat and was rushed to hospital. Police, however, suspect that the injury was self-inflicted. According to the police, the victim, Nishat Firdous, along with her husband and father-in-law, Mohammed Pasha, has been staying at the latter’s house in Kamareddy town. At 7.30 am on Tuesday, Firdous, who was attending to daily chores in the compound of the house, raised an alarm and told her father-in-law that an unidentified person attacked her with a blade and fled towards a neighbour’s house. “When the incident happened, Habeeb was asleep. Before shifting Firdous to the hospital, her family members and neighbours searched the surroundings but did not notice any suspicious-looking persons,” Kamareddy Town inspector S Madhusudhan said. “Firdous is out of danger and once she recovers we will gather more details from her,” the inspector said. The forensic team found a shaving blade at the crime scene and police observed that the shaving blade is of the same brand used by her husband and father-in-law. “We suspect that it could be a self-inflicted injury but we are investigating from all angles,” the inspector said. A case was registered.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/woman-attacked-cops-suspect-injury-self-inflicted/articleshow/85815871.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Despite late start, fastest Covid vaccination coverage in 18-44 age group in Mumbai||MUMBAI: Despite a slow and late start, the younger, tech-savvy population in the age group 18-44 has seen the swiftest vaccination coverage. In Mumbai, 61% in this category have received at least one dose even though their inoculation started in May and was erratic till late June. In comparison, those 45-59 years old and in the 60-plus bracket, who started getting jabs in March, have not been entirely covered with one dose yet. Around 88% in the 45-59 group and 96.7% senior citizens have got at least one dose so far. Civic data shows highest share of doses (43%) has gone to the 18-44 age bracket, followed by 29% to the 45-59 and 19% to senior citizens. About 7% in 18-44 have received two doses so far. In the 45-59 bracket, 52% have got two doses; in senior citizens, it is 66%. Vaccination of senior citizens and those above 45 with comorbidities began in March. Month later, vaccination for all 45-plus irrespective of comorbidities followed. For 18-44, it started from May 1, but under a new policy that put the onus of vaccinating them on states. Maharashtra could vaccinate this group only for 12 days before having to divert doses for older groups. Younger groups thus could not get free vaccines till June 21 when the Centre once again revised its policy to cover the 18-44 as well. Most in this category have got vaccinated at private centres. Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state’s Covid taskforce, said this group is comfortable with technology and could use Co-Win with ease. "That is one of the key reasons why a large proportion has managed to get vaccinated so quickly. There was also willingness to get vaccinated,” he said. An official said the 18-44 group has the highest share in the city's adult population. Of the estimated 93 lakh adults, nearly 59 lakh are from the 18-44 bracket which explains why they have received maximum doses. "People from their age group also had to return to work as quickly as possible," the official said. The slow pace of vaccination among older age groups is a cause for concern. In fact, in the 45-59 bracket, nearly 12% people have not taken a single dose. That roughly translates into 2.3 lakh people. Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer, said it‘s intriguing why people are not coming forward for second doses. "We believe hesitancy is one of the reasons,” she said. When asked if frequent stockouts at public centres could be blamed, she said a fixed quota of doses was set aside for second dose recipients, but often there wouldn’t be takers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-despite-late-start-fastest-vax-coverage-in-18-44-age-group/articleshow/85815925.cms||Sumitra Debroy

Speaking during the premiere of a documentary on the Asaf Jahi Dynasty -Shaukath-e-Osmania- on Monday, Mahmood Ali said that the Nizam was a secular leader who always put public welfare interests above self. He lauded the Nizam’s secular character and public welfare initiatives. Mir Najaf Ali Khan, grandson of the seventh Nizam of Hyderabad, said that it was important to spread awareness among the next generation on the Asaf Jahi dynasty’s contributions. “It is extremely important to educate the next generation of the contributions, the glory and vision of the Asaf Jahi dynasty. The audio visual presentations could play a big role in spreading awareness of the glory of our past,” said Najaf Ali Khan. The home minister said, “The Nizam treated Hindus and Muslims equally and respected all religions.” The secular character of the Nizams is apparent from the fact that more than eleven non-Muslims served the Nizam in key roles. On the occasion, the contributions of Nizam documented in the recently released book Shaukath-e-Osmania published by Telangana State Urdu Academy was presented in the form of an audio visual documentary. The documentary features contributions of Nizam of Hyderabad from his donations to different religious institutions, infrastructure development, educational initiatives and visionary leadership.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/nizam-treated-hindus-muslims-equally-min/articleshow/85815905.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Punjab CM Capt Amarinder Singh contradicts Rahul Gandhi on spruced up Jallianwala memorial with ‘looked very nice’||CHANDIGARH/AMRITSAR: Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Tuesday said the renovated Jallianwala Bagh memorial “looked very nice”, quite in contrast to the criticism of the Centre over the move by former Congress president Rahul Gandhi. “I don’t know what has been removed. Whatever I saw that night (at the inauguration event), to me it looked very nice,” said Amarinder in reply to a question at a media interaction. However, he added that he hadn’t seen Rahul’s tweet on the issue. Rahul termed the revamped memorial an “insult to martyrs”, posting a news report on the criticism of the spruced up memorial by netizens. He added in Hindi: “Such an insult to the martyrs of Jallianwala Bagh can only be done by those who do not know the meaning of martyrdom. I am the son of a martyr - I will not tolerate the insult of martyrs at any cost. We are against this indecent cruelty.” The difference of opinion between the two Congress leaders comes at a time when a section of party leaders from the state has questioned the Amarinder’s leadership ahead of the assembly elections due in early 2022. Some other opposition leaders too have been critical of the memorial’s new look. The renovated memorial was dedicated to the national virtually by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday. Speaking at the event, Amarinder had described it as a tribute to the great martyrs and a symbol of inspiration for the youth. The event was also attended, among others, by several Union ministers, Punjab governor, leader of the opposition and the Jallianwala Bagh trustees, along with several MPs and MLAs. It courted controversy just three days later, with not just Jallianwala Bagh Shaheed Parivar Samiti (JBSPS) but even historians and politicians objecting to the facelift. They blamed the government for destroying the originality of the memorial, where hundreds had died on the day of Baisakhi on April 13, 1919. On the very day of inauguration on August 28, British historian Kim Wagner commented that the last traces of the massacre of April 1919 have effectively been erased. And then began the storm on social media, with people giving their opinion and comments on the renovation of the historical site with many accusing the government of erasing the history and the very characteristics of the Jallianwala Bagh. Prominent among those who disapproved the renovations were Rahul and CPM leader Sitaram Yechury among others. Former head of Guru Nanak Dev University’s Guru Ram Das School of Planning, Professor Balwinder Singh said conservation and development work should have been in harmony with the original character of the area. If at all murals had to be used, then there should have also been of the British troops entering the same alley and blocking escape for the crowd assembled inside. “We are thankful to the government for the huge investment, but the Jallianwala Bagh’s new look lacks the feel of the place for which it is known. It looks more like a picnic place now,” he said. When asked about the renovation work, Jallianwala Bagh National Memorial Trust (JBNMT) secretary S K Mukherjee refused to “comment anything on the renovation at this juncture”. Sources said that those closely associated with the JBNMT have also objected to the colour of light that falls on the flame of liberty and the improper impact of laser light and sound show. Murals take over the narrow lane The narrow passage, with stark brick walls, right at the entrance/exit of the Jallianwala Bagh that one had to cross on foot, as it was not wide enough to accommodate vehicles, is no more. Instead, there is a lane walled with shiny murals and crowded with wooden logs. The murals of human figures symbolise the common people who had gathered on the occasion of Baisakhi, defying the British diktat which prohibited mass gatherings, and fell to bullets on the orders of Brigadier-general Reginald Dyer in 1919. A separate exit lane has been carved out for tourists. Counters outside the Jallianwala Bagh suggest possible imposition of entry ticket. Speaking to TOI on Tuesday, JBSPS president Mahesh Behal said, “Our major objection is complete lack of originality of the entry lane, giving it a new look by plastering walls with cemented murals on both sides and closing doors and windows. There was no need to put wooden logs in the lane.” He also objected to replacing the brass railing with wooden railing and poor public amenities among others. However, he welcomed the dedicated lane for tourists “even if one has to walk nearly half a kilometre extra to reach the entry gate. It is good to regulate the tourists rush”. >> A small cemented pyramid structure, which informed visitors that “people were fired at from here” has also been demolished. The location of Amar Jyoti or the eternal flame and the flag post has also been changed . >> A 28-minutes new laser light and sound show depicting how British troops had massacred the people and how they (people) tried to save themselves, which had the voiceover of Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachan, has been replaced. Tweets August 28 Kim Wagner, professor of Global and Imperial History, University of London “Devastated to hear that Jallianwala Bagh, site of the Amritsar Massacre of 1919, has been revamped - which means that the last traces of the event have effectively been erased. This is what I wrote of the memorial in my book, describing a space that has now itself become history” August 31 Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh on current controversy “I don’t know what has been removed. To me it looks very nice.” Rahul Gandhi जलियाँवाला बाग़ के शहीदों का ऐसा अपमान वही कर सकता है जो शहादत का मतलब नहीं जानता। मैं एक शहीद का बेटा हूँ- शहीदों का अपमान किसी क़ीमत पर सहन नहीं करूँगा। हम इस अभद्र क्रूरता के ख़िलाफ़ हैं। (Only those can insult the martrys of Jallianwala Bagh who do not know the meaning of martyrdom.

---||Pune||Pune: Teacher loses Rs 3.2 lakh after clicking on link sent by ‘helpline’||By- Gitesh SheklePUNE: A 32-year-old private college teacher lost Rs3.2 lakh to fraudsters while seeking help for a problem he encountered after downloading a credit card payment application. In a police complaint lodged on Monday, the teacher stated that the fraudsters used the details of his two credit cards to transfer Rs3.2 lakh to four bank accounts — two in Andhra Pradesh and one each in West Bengal and Gujarat. Inspector Vijay Puranik of the Bharati Vidyapeeth police said the complaint stated that teacher contacted the app’s helpline after he did not get a message relating to a Rs90,000 transfer he made to the app. “The helpline executive advised him to fill an online form for which a link was sent to him. The victim filled the form which sought details such as card numbers, date of expiry and security code. The helpline executives said he would receive a password on his email to reset the app. After submitting the form, he got an email with a password, but before he could use the password, his SIM stopped functioning,” said Puranik. “By the time the SIM card was restored, the fraudsters had transferred Rs3.2 lakh using his credit card details,” he added. Pune cyber police officials suspect it to be a case of SIM swap as the victim’s SIM card stopped functioning for some time during which the unauthorised transactions was carried out. “We are trying to find the source from where the suspects operated the SIM,” a cyber police officer said. “Prima facie, it appears that the suspects were operating as a team. We have obtained the details of the bank accounts to which the money was transferred. Also, we have details of the cellphone number used to send the text message with the link,” said Puranik.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/teacher-loses-rs-3-2l-after-clicking-on-link-sent-by-helpline/articleshow/85815885.cms||---

Nearly 130 cartons of liquor -- being smuggled from Haryana to Bihar -- were kept in a secret compartment of the diesel tanker. Police have also arrested six smugglers, four of them were following the tanker from Haryana in a car. “We have also recovered fake labels of liquor brands from the car. This gang had been engaged in smuggling of liquor for years,” said police An FIR has been registered at Sadar Bazar police station under sections 420 (cheating), 467 (forgery of valuable property, will), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (fraudulently using any forged document as a genuine document) of IPC along with sections 60 and 63 of the State Excise Act against Nasir Ali, Vinod, Bhagwan Singh, Mahendra, Jasveer and Bharat. All the accused were sent to jail on Tuesday. Shahjahanpur SSP S Anand told TOI, “Our special operations team received a tip-off that liquor was being smuggled in a diesel tanker. The suspected vehicle was intercepted by sub-inspector Rohit Kumar and his team but they only found diesel in the tanker. When the truck driver and the helper were questioned separately, one of them revealed the way of opening the secret chamber. It was a specially made tanker with two compartments.

---||Nagpur||Online consultation, reports, medicines, prescriptions — new normal post Covid||Nagpur: Going to a doctor for every health problem and discussing face-to-face, planning visits and re-visits to clinics, pathology labs, and finally visiting medical stores to buy prescribed medicines — this could have been the schedule of patients during the pre-pandemic time. But, after two waves of Covid-19, most of these have become the things of past. Doctors are now available on phone calls and WhatsApp video calls; pathology-labs have started door-to-door sample collection services and providing online reports. Doctors are also ready to receive the reports online and some of them are sending their prescriptions online too. Pharmacists are accepting these online prescriptions and sending medicines at doorsteps. Entire system has witnessed a massive change in last 18 months. “Maharashtra Medical Council (MMC) was the first regulatory authority in the country to legalize the online consultation ahead of the Covid-19 pandemic. Other states followed us. It was a milestone decision taken even before the first wave’s peak,” said Dr Vinky Rughwani, vice-president of the MMC. Due to this decision in April 2020, consultation on phones, video calls, online chat, mobile applications etc. became legal and authorized. Doctors as well as techno-savvy patients started making the optimum use of this facility. Vinayak Deshmukh, a 65-year-old diabetes patient, stays in Yavatmal and is under treatment of a renowned endocrinologist in Nagpur. “I conduct my sugar test in a local lab at my hometown and send its report to my doctor on WhatsApp. He gives consultation online too,” he said. This has not only curtailed Deshmukh’s monthly visits to Nagpur, but the WhatsApp consultation has got everything in written form available for his ready reference right in his phone. “Online consultation is a boon to senior citizens. Your medical profile is right there in your phone. This is future for the patients who require long-term medication on lifestyle diseases,” said physician Dr Amol Kadu. Indian Medical Association (IMA) has also organized frequent online workshops on this subject in last 2 years now. According to Dr Sandeep Yadav, president of Maharashtra Association of practicing pathologists and microbiologists, the online facility is booming. “It’s handy as well as time saving for the pathology labs to forward reports on phone. We always keep the hard copy available in lab. Patient can visit as per the convenience and collect the copies. But, online saves a lot of time,” he said. During peak of Covid-19, thousands of patients received their reports on phone from the government authorities. Online registration process for vaccination was an instant hit. Very recent addition to it is a facility that allows vaccinated people to download their certificate immediately. These initiatives are underlining the change in the field of health facilities post Covid-19 pandemic. “The time has come when we must learn to live with novel coronavirus. Going digital is a must to avoid crowd, traffic, waiting period at doctor’s place and risk of infection. Hospitals are always there for emergency and critical situation for sure. But, most of the times, digital consultation from home can be best option,” said general physician Dr Parita Telang.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/online-consultation-reports-medicines-prescriptions-new-normal-post-covid/articleshow/85815922.cms||Chaitanya Deshpande
---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Our rivals rattled by increase in Bahujan Samaj Party’s electoral base, says Mayawati||Lucknow: Accusing BJP, Congress and Samajwadi Party of hatching conspiracy against her party, BSP chief Mayawati on Tuesday told her party functionaries to stay alert and tackle the deceitful designs of the political rivals ahead of Uttar Pradesh assembly elections next year. Presiding over a review meeting at the party headquarters in Lucknow, Mayawati said, “Our political rivals are rattled by the rise in BSP’s electoral base and its emergence as a strong option to BJP.” Referring to BSP’s ‘Prabuddh Sammelans’ being held in different districts, Mayawati said their success has jolted rivals. “BJP is feeling the threat of losing power in UP,” she said. The sammelans being held under party’s general secretary SC Mishra aim to woo back Brahmins, attempting a repeat of social engineering that hoisted Mayawati to power in 2007 with full majority for the first time. Mayawati hit out at ruling BJP for taking steps to gain cheap popularity. “Otherwise too, a major part of BJP’s tenure has been spent in doing unproductive work,” she said. She also attacked the Union government accusing it of being unmoved by farmers’ agitation against farm laws for the past nine months. On the contrary, Bahujan Samaj Party has always stood steadfast with farmers and raised their issues within and outside the Parliament, she added. “The farmers are on a warpath in Uttar Pradesh also. We appeal to the Uttar Pradesh government to consider their demands,” she said. The Bahujan Samaj Party chief also asked party functionaries from nine divisions of the state to take stock of preparedness of booth-level committees, which are of immense importance for the party’s electoral prospects. She said the political spade work at the grass roots needs to be intensified and told party leaders to keep updating her about the developments from time to time.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/our-rivals-rattled-by-increase-in-bsps-electoral-base-maya/articleshow/85818083.cms||---

A video of the incident has also surfaced, showing a man stuck between a train and the platform being dragged by the train and a constable, identified as Rajnish Yadav, running towards him. Yadav rescued the passenger safely before the train stopped as someone in the train pulled the chain. The passenger was in a hurry to reach Lucknow for some urgent work, so he requested Yadav to let him board the train instead of visiting a hospital. Yadav told TOI, “I was on duty at platform number one on Monday evening when I heard people screaming. Then I saw a man stuck between a train and the platform being dragged by the train. I immediately ran towards him and pulled him out. I am happy that he was saved. He wanted to go to Lucknow urgently, so he boarded the same train. I didn’t even ask his name.” Soon, the information spread among GRP officers and they checked the CCTV footage. Someone even shared the video on social media that was widely circulated. “Rajnish saved the passenger on time. Any delay would have cost the passenger his life. We have recommended a commendation letter for him for his heroic act,” said circle officer Devi Dayal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/grp-cop-saves-man-who-slipped-while-boarding-moving-train-in-moradabad/articleshow/85810603.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: Classes 6-12 reopen today, but most parents still in wait-and-watch mode||BHOPAL: Schools set to re-open for classes 6 to 12 from Wednesday, after more than a year long pandemic triggered lockdown has triggered anxiety among parents and guardians who are adopting a wait and watch approach. Assurances by the district administration and school managements of 100% safety of their children in schools have failed to enthuse confidence among the parents. The administration has however made parents’ consent must for children attending classes physically. “I am not sending my daughter to school tomorrow. Before they are fully vaccinated, no parent would like to take the risk,” said Kailash Sen, whose daughter is in class 6. Schools on the other hand are going out of their way to assure the parents 100% safety of children in schools. Vice-president of MP Association of Unaided Private Schools, Vinny Raj Modi, said, “We have made all the preparations to ensure safety of children coming to schools according to SOP issued by the state government and we wish to invite parents to come to school and see for themselves, their children would be completely safe on the school campus.” However, fear of the third wave of Coronavirus fuelled by speculations to that effect in media and elsewhere is a major reason for reluctance on the part of parents in sending their wards to schools. “I am surprised how the state government allowed the opening of schools even as the possibility of a third wave of Coronavirus is being expressed by the experts,” asked a worried parent. However, there are some teachers who feel that it’s more of inertia than fear, which is stopping parents from sending their children to schools. “Children have not been going to school for over a year. There is some fear indeed but more than that it’s inertia which is stopping the parents and to some extent children from coming to schools. You see, schools from standard 9 to 12 are already on. Maybe once or twice in a week but classes are taking place. I don’t think Coronavirus cases have been reported from any school, yet attendance in these classes has remained dismally low. Nobody wants to put children at risk but feeling why to go to school when online classes are available is not fear but inertia, which children and their parents must overcome,” said a teacher of a prestigious public school on the condition of anonymity. “My son has been attending classes. I think with adequate precautions, if children go to schools it’s not a problem at least for students from class 9 to 12,” said Omprakash Shrivastava, whose son is in class 12. Even as debate on whether regular classes in schools should take place now when Coronavirus cases have come down drastically, availability of school buses is also in question. “The school buses have been off the roads for more than a year. It may take a few days to put them in order. Besides, not many parents have made inquiries on whether the school buses would ply or not. In this situation, I don’t think school buses will be available right from the first day,” said a school principal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/anxious-parents-not-willing-to-send-kids-as-schools-set-to-reopen-today/articleshow/85815896.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Sena MP forged signatures on trust docus in Mumbai: ED||Mumbai: Shiv Sena MP from Yavatmal-Washim Bhavana Gawali, who is being probed by the Enforcement Directorate in a money laundering case, has allegedly forged signatures with the help of her aide to get their trust converted to a company with the tag of a non-profit organisation where siphoning of funds is comparatively easier, ED sources said. The Mahila Utkarsh Pratishthan Trust was registered as a trust with the charity commissioner, where Gawali was the president and there were around eight trustees. The trust runs Mahila Utkarsh Pratishthan’s Ayurved College, Hospital and Research Centre in Washim, among other institutions. A few years ago, the trust was registered as a company under Section 8 of the Companies Act with the aim of promoting non-profit objectives such as trade, arts, charity, education, sports and other such activities. Sources said that the monitoring mechanism is stricter in the case of a trust as compared to this non-profit organisation registered under the Companies Act, 2013. “Morover, in the trust, there is a beneficiary for whom the trust is created. This makes siphoning of the funds difficult.” In the case of the company, the directors or shareholders can manipulate the funds easier, an ED official said. For changing the registration, signatures of all the eight trustees were obtained fraudulently. Sources said Gawali, with the help of others, allegedly forged the NOCs of the charity commissioner and from the bank. In the newly created company, Gawali’s mother Shalini had a 5% stake, with the rest held by her aide Sayeed Khan. All the affairs were controlled by Gawali, said ED sources. The former trustees were upset with the new arrangement. On Monday, Gawali had alleged the ED action was vindictive and Sena leaders were being targeted for raising their voices against the Modi government’s policies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/sena-mp-forged-signatures-on-trust-docus-in-mumbai-ed/articleshow/85819030.cms||Vijay V Singh

---||Lucknow||Former UP CM Kalyan Singh's ethics were fusion of RSS values, good governance, says Union defence minister Rajnath Singh||LUCKNOW: Paying rich tributes to former UP CM Kalyan Singh, defence minister and Lucknow MP Rajnath Singh on Tuesday said the veteran BJP leader was a reflection of compositeness of RSS values, strength of Sangh and duties of a government. Rajnath was speaking at a meeting called by BJP to pay tributes to Kalyan. The party had organised such meetings in all 1,918 organisational divisions of UP, in what was seen as a significant move to invoke the saffron poster boy ahead of the UP assembly elections. In Lucknow, the meeting was attended by senior RSS functionary, Krishna Gopal, CM Yogi Adityanath, his two deputies and UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh. Calling Kalyan a leader, a brother and a friend, Rajnath recalled how he used to go on a ‘pravas’ with him during political assignments. When Kalyan was UP BJP chief, Rajnath was president of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha. During Kalyan’s second stint as UP CM, Rajnath was UP BJP chief. “He was a leader who performed his duties with full dedication…yet he was very light hearted,” Rajnath said. The defence minister said the etalents of Kalyan came to the fore in 1977 when he became health minister of UP. His capabilities prompted people to see in him UP’s future CM. This was the time when the then Janata party formed a coalition government in several states including UP. Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan offers his condolence to the family members of the late CM at their home in AligarhRajnath also recalled his stint as education minister when Kalyan was CM and a stringent anti-copying proposal was brought by the government. “There was a difference of opinion between cabinet colleagues vis-à-vis the proposal. They used to say that it would turn people hostile against BJP,” he said. Singh said he then met CM Kalyan who called a cabinet meeting and categorically suggested that the anti-copying proposal be passed without any discussion. “That was the time when we saw his perseverance to run a government,” Rajnath said, maintaining that Kalyan’s stand on anti-copying proposal – it later became an Act (in 1992) which made use of unfair means in examinations a non-bailable cognisable offence – showed that politics was not just for forming government but also to bring change in society. The act was later repealed by the SP government headed by Mulayam Singh Yadav. CM Yogi said people will continue to remember Kalyan Singh till there is political purity and a feeling of values and dedication for the public welfare. He termed Kalyan as a leader whose rise was essentially driven by his deeds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/kalyans-ethics-were-fusion-of-rss-values-good-governance/articleshow/85818115.cms||Pankaj Shah

He gave directions to the officials for installing biological odour control systems and floating aerators in sewage treatment plants and drains for preventing bad odour and air pollution. “Many people are saying that the Yamuna cannot be cleaned, but this task can be achieved. All projects in this direction and even otherwise should be fast-tracked and completed in a time-bound manner,” Jain said. He added: “All STPs must be equipped with biological odour control systems as soon as possible so that people living around as well as the workers at the STPs don’t get affected by harmful foul smell emanating from them. This work should be done on priority basis.” He said all drains in the capital will be revamped under the Drainage Master Plan for making the drainage system more efficacious. In the first phase, floating aerators should be installed in drains. Jain also reviewed projects related to 24x7 water supply. On Saturday, DJB vice-chairman Raghav Chadha also held a review meeting on water consumption patterns and supply cycles in 24x7 water supply pilot areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/work-towards-making-sewage-plants-drains-odour-free-jain-tells-officials/articleshow/85815958.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Take steps now to control crowds or pandemic will worsen, warns Bombay high court||MUMBAI: If immediate steps are not taken to control crowds in Mumbai, the pandemic situation will be the same as last year, the Bombay high court cautioned on Tuesday. A full bench led by Chief Justice Dipankar Datta made oral observations after expressing concern over increasing crowds in public places following the easing of lockdown curbs and the ensuing festivals. With days left for Ganeshotsav, the markets, like this one in Dadar, are crowded everydayThe bench warned that if crowd-control measures are not taken, the pandemic situation would worsen. “Considering the prevailing situation of uncertainties and ensuing festivities, we face a threat to humankind,’’ said CJ Datta. The judges referred to photos in newspapers of huge crowds on Mumbai’s beaches such as Juhu and Girgaum Chowpatty, and on Marine Drive. “If you (government) do not control or restrict this, again the same situation as last year is bound to happen. We need to draw from our experience,’’ said the CJ. The court was referring to the deadly peaking of the Covid wave after the festivals around this time last year. The authorities and citizens must learn from earlier mistakes and not be complacent, said the HC. On Monday, Dr Rahul Pandit, who is part of the special task force for Covid-19 management appointed by the Supreme Court, told the administrative committee the “third wave is knocking at our doors”, said CJ Datta. Pandit also suggested the country will have to follow Covid-appropriate behavior till at least April 2022, he added. “Unless Covid-appropriate behaviour is followed, the state will face imminent danger. Dr Pandit is of the view that at least till the end of April 2022, the nation may not get rid of the ill-effects of Covid,” said the CJ. The bench extended relief by a month till September 30 from interim orders on demolition, eviction and dispossession. The full bench will assemble next on September 24 to review the situation and pass necessary orders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-take-steps-now-to-control-crowds-or-pandemic-will-worsen-warns-hc/articleshow/85815976.cms||---

Whatever the high command thought is good for the party, they have done. Now I have to do whatever I can so that the party comes to office.” Sardinha had of late been quite vocal about Chodankar’s criticism over his “inefficiency” in taking everybody along. His was among the first voices from the party camp demanding a change of guard. He was also among the contenders for the top post. Asked if he was happy with the latest development, Sardinha said, “The question of my being happy or unhappy doesn’t arise. Whatever I felt I had told the high command. As a loyal soldier of the party, I have to accept the high command’s decision. The high command took a decision in the interest of the party. I have now to follow that decision in the interest of the party.” Sardinha made these statements while speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a meeting he chaired of the District Development Coordination & Monitoring Committee (DDCMC) where he reviewed the progress of various proposed projects of 14 government departments. At the meeting Sardinha reviewed the progress of the work of installation of CCTV cameras and public toilets along the coastal belt under the central government schemes as well as other works.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/sardinha-toes-party-line-on-gpcc-chiefs-appointment/articleshow/85815964.cms||---
---||Noida||Supertech twin-towers demolition: Developer-authority nexus needs to be dealt with strictly, says SC||NEW DELHI: Referring to collusion between Supertech and the Noida authority which allowed the company to construct two illegal 40-storey towers, the Supreme Court on Tuesday said such connivance between developers and authorities across the country is leading to rampant unauthorised construction and it needs to be dealt with strictly. A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah said rules and regulation are being violated by developers who collude with the planning authority and its officials. It said the Supertech case is an example of how builders and the authorities work in collusion for illegal constructions. “The rampant increase in unauthorised constructions across urban areas, particularly in metropolitan cities where soaring values of land place a premium on dubious dealings has been noticed in several decisions of this court. This state of affairs has often come to pass in no small a measure because of the collusion between developers and planning authorities,” the bench said. The apex court said that two crucial considerations have to be kept in mind while building houses to accommodate the constant influx of people in metros – protection of environment and the well-being and safety of those who occupy these buildings. “The regulation of the entire process is intended to ensure that constructions which will have a severe negative environmental impact are not sanctioned. Hence, when these regulations are brazenly violated by developers, more often than not with the connivance of regulatory authorities, it strikes at the very core of urban planning, thereby directly resulting in an increased harm to the environment and a dilution of safety standards. Hence, illegal construction has to be dealt with strictly to ensure compliance with the rule of law,” the court said. The Supreme Court bench, which had termed Noida as a corrupt body during the hearing, upheld the Allahabad High Court verdict to prosecute its erring officers who had approved construction of the twin towers by Supertech. “The illegal construction of towers has been achieved through acts of collusion between officers of NOIDA and the appellant (Supertech) and its management,” it said, adding “the record of this case is replete with instances which highlight the collusion.” The court noted that complicity of Noida authority was writ large in various decisions taken by it to favour of the builder, including sanctioning the second revised plan in 2009 and its refusal to disclose the building plans under the RTI Act and by refusing to act on Chief Fire Officer’s report with regard to the violation of minimum distance requirements in the Emerald Court project. The bench said the developer raised false pleas and attempted to mislead this court, while the officials of Noida have not acted bona fide in discharge of their duties. “The appellant has stooped to the point of producing a fabricated sanctioned plan. Therefore, we confirm the directions of the High Court including the order of demolition and for sanctioning prosecution under Section 49 of the Uttar Pradesh Urban Development Act , as incorporated by Section 12 of Uttar Pradesh Industrial Area Development Act, against the officials of the appellant and officers of Noida,” the SC bench stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/developer-authority-nexus-needs-to-be-dealt-with-strictly-says-sc/articleshow/85815933.cms||---
---||Bhopal||‘Schools will be responsible to ensure adherence to Covid SOP’||District collector Avinash Lavania says a decision to open schools has been taken because socialising and physically attending classes is crucial for students. And, 100% safety of students will be ensured on the campuses. Excerpts from a brief interview with the district collector: What preparations are there to ensure safety of students? Apart from other preparations according to SOP applicable for schools, our focus is to ensure proper social distancing and that’s why schools have been allowed to function with half the capacity. A student will go to school only 3 days a week. We are getting certificates from private schools that their 100% staff is vaccinated. In govt schools, 97.5% of staff is vaccinated. Those left out are either on leave or vaccination could not take place due to their medical condition. Nobody from the school staff would be allowed on the campus without vaccination. Who will be responsible to ensure observance of Covid protocol in schools? School managements would be responsible, monitored by the district administration. How will the district administration monitor that? We will conduct regular inspections to ensure that Covid norms are followed in schools. Some schools are insisting with parents to send their wards to schools and also thinking to discontinue online classes, so that attendance gets a boost? I think schools can design their own curriculum the way they want to. We have allowed them to take classes with 50% attendance and so long as the studies of children don’t suffer, they can have their own curriculum. But, I am not the right person to answer this question, it’s between the schools and the department concerned. There will be periodic exams at schools in September. What happens if the schools make it mandatory for students to appear in exams offline? It’s again for the school education department to decide on the issue. There are parents asking why schools are opening at all when the Corona pandemic is not over yet? Socialising and physically attending classes is necessary for students. That’s why the decision to open schools has been taken with all the preparedness to ensure 100% safety of all the students on the campus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/schools-will-be-responsible-to-ensure-adherence-to-covid-sop/articleshow/85815931.cms||Ashutosh Shukla

The body was found by the local residents from the pond on February 26. Initially, the family members of the deceased were not cooperating with the police. However, the autopsy findings had turned crucial in the case. The mobile call details of the accused was also a major evidence.

He appealed to the people to give the BJP the opportunity to rule, just like all other parties in united Andhra Pradesh and Telangana did. “BJP is working hard to make India a Vishva Guru (global teacher), give us a chance here too,” he said at a public gathering near Chekur in Rangareddy district. He accused chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao of brazenly praising the Nizam’s dictatorship, saying that the BJP stands for those who gave their lives for Telangana. “BJP respects Sardar Vallabhai Patel’s legacy, but the chief minister has nothing but praise for Nizam. He bowed before Nizam’s tomb after the state formation,” he said. Reflecting on Saturday’s public meeting at Charminar, he said, “Owaisi has challenged to hold a meeting in Old City, if he continues to challenge, we will hold another public meeting in Darussalam (MIM headquarters). “When we get to power in 2023, we will return to Bhagyalakshmi temple and host the first meeting there,” he added. He also asked chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao to make his stand clear on GO 111. BJP national spokesperson Sambit Patra, who accompanied Sanjay, said Telangana is ruled by the land, sand and liquor mafia. Slamming the TRS administration as “one-family led dictatorship”, he said that chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao’s son and nephew have been given ministerial posts and daughter was made MLC, but the unemployed in the state are waiting for job notifications.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bandi-plays-majority-cardseeks-one-chance-to-rule-t/articleshow/85815916.cms||Sribala Vadlapatla

They don’t care whether people live or die, they will continue with their politics,” he said, speaking at the virtual inauguration of an oxygen plant in Thane by Shiv Sena MLA Pratap Sarnaik. Without naming MNS, the CM said that all those who are taking to the streets and creating chaos by flouting the government rules do not have the courage or the vision to undertake projects that will help the public. “Why can’t they set up oxygen plants or donate ambulances? There are people like Sarnaik who are prioritising the health of the public… Shiv Sena’s ambulance service has been of use to so many, including actor Amitabh Bachchan, who has narrated the incident when his life was saved because of our ambulance service,” said Thackeray, claiming Sena was set up to do 80% social work and 20% politics. His cousin and MNS leader Raj Thackeray accused the government of “selectively” relaxing curbs while referring to the BJP yatra and rituals in a temple by the son of a Sena MLA. “The three parties (of the government) are using the Covid situation for their benefit. People have the right to celebrate their festivals,” he said. “The way MNS workers were arrested, it seems like a revenge politics (by the government).”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/those-organising-aashirwad-yatras-endangering-lives-cm/articleshow/85816023.cms||Bhavika Jain

Thakkar, Vidarbha operations head of GTPL Hathway, had checked in a day earlier along with his colleague Dipesh Shah. Thakkar and his colleague Shah were in room no. 201, but the former had shifted to room no. 205 on the fifth floor at night as he was not feeling well. Both had booked the hotel for a night’s rest. When the fire broke out around 3am due to short-circuit in the switchboard close to room no. 201, power supply to entire building got snapped. Even as other guests were rescued from the smoke-filled rooms, Thakkar fell unconscious as there was no ventilation for the smoke to pass out. He was rushed to district general hospital where doctors declared him dead. The electric panel where the short-circuit occurred contained all switches of the hotel that has 13 rooms. Out of them, five rooms were occupied by guests when the incident took place. Police personnel on patrolling duty had noticed the fire and they informed the fire brigade department. Fire brigade personnel had a tough time putting out the inferno due to narrow lanes. A loss of Rs10 lakh to the property of hotel has been estimated. The police have booked hotel owner and manager under Section 304 (a). This is the second incident of fire in the city in three days. These incidents have once raised question mark over fire audit at important buildings in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nagpur-man-dies-in-amravati-hotel-fire/articleshow/85815995.cms||---

The complainant requested police to take appropriate action against the accused firm. According to cyber crime ACP KVM Prasad, the complainant mentioned that they have been using the services of two IT security companies and the computers operating on the software provided by one of the companies were affected by ransomware. “The complainant mentioned that there was no data loss and their IT team was able to ensure that the operations were not completely affected,” the ACP said. Alleging that the IT company providing certain services to Apollo Pharmacy network was responsible for the trouble they had to face, the complainant requested police to initiate appropriate legal action against the company. According to cyber crime police, ransomware attack infiltrates the computers of targeted network and encrypts the data, making it inaccessible to the authorised user. The attackers provide the key after ransom is paid. But, in this case, no ransom was demanded from Apollo Pharmacy. “We have to talk to the company which has provided IT services to Apollo Pharmacy to find out what happened. A case was registered under Sections 66-c, 43 r/w 66 of the IT Act,” the ACP said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/apollo-pharmacy-lodges-plaint-against-firm-over-cyber-attack/articleshow/85815967.cms||---
---||Delhi||Flat buyers worst sufferers, law must step in to protect them: SC||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday said home buyers are the worst sufferers of the “unholy nexus between builders and planners” and law must step in to protect them. The apex court said any builder could not be allowed to violate rights of home buyers on the ground that they have not formed Residents’ Welfare Association. It said a builder cannot change the building plan and construct additional buildings without taking the consent of residents. “The judgments of this court spanning the last four decades emphasise the duty of planning bodies, while sanctioning building plans and enforcing building regulations and bye-laws to conform to the norms by which they are governed. A breach by the planning authority of its obligation to ensure compliance with building regulations is actionable at the instance of residents whose rights are infringed by the violation of law,” a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah said. “Their (flat buyers) quality of life is directly affected by the failure of the planning authority to enforce compliance. Unfortunately, the diverse and unseen group of flat buyers suffers the impact of unholy nexus between builders and planners. Their quality of life is affected the most. Yet, confronted with the economic might of developers and the might of legal authority wielded by planning bodies, the few who raise their voices have to pursue a long and expensive battle for rights with little certainty of outcomes. As this case demonstrates, they are denied access to information and are victims of misinformation. Hence, the law must step in to protect their legitimate concerns,” it said. It said the percentage of the undivided interest of each owner of a flat in the common areas and facilities shall not be altered without the consent of all the owners of the flats. While directing demolition of the twin towers, the court said it was built on area which was earlier shown as garden area and all the residents had equal stake in the green area which was altered by the construction. “Hence, it is abundantly clear that the construction of towers in accordance with the second revised plan and third revised plan reduced the value of undivided interest held by each individual flat owner in the common areas and facilities, thereby violating Section 5 of the UP 1975 Act and Section 5 of the UP Apartments Act 2010, since the flat owners’ consent was not sought. Further, the third revised plan encroached upon the garden area in front of Tower 1, thereby resiling from the representation that had been made to the flat owners at the time when they purchased the apartments in the tower, without their consent. Therefore, it constituted a violation of Section 4(1) read with the proviso to Section 4(4) of the UP Apartments Act 2010,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/flat-buyers-worst-sufferers-law-must-step-in-to-protect-them/articleshow/85815970.cms||---
---||Kolkata||UG seat scarcity looms in Kolkata as high-scorers crowd merit list||KOLKATA: Merit lists published by colleges and universities on Tuesday showed how tough the competition was for undergraduate seats this time, with hardly any difference in marks scored by the topper and by say, the candidate on the 15th rung. Students worries that despite high Plus-II scores, many might not be able to study the subjects of their choice in preferred institutes. Universities, like Presidency and Jadavpur, and colleges, like Ramakrishna Mission Vidyamandira, Ramakrishna Mission College Narendrapur, Bethune, Lady Brabourne and Scottish Church, have limited seats, meaning chances even for high-scorers are low there. For example, an applicant at Bethune College with a Plus-II percentage of 96 has ranked 663 on the zoology merit list. Principal Krishna Roy said, “This is too early to comment on final cut-offs. We have to wait for a few days to see how many students finally opt for the subjects they have applied for.” “Good institutes have 25 to 50 UG seats, while the the top 10 or 150 rank-holders have scored above 95%. Those scoring less will have to wait for subsequent lists if there is any vacancy,” said the principal of a south Kolkata college. “In most subjects, the academic score has gone up. The difference of marks scored by toppers has reduced to a mere fraction in many instances,” said a head of the department at Presidency University. Lady Brabourne principal Suili Sarkar said, “The percentage is too high. We have applied percentile formula to ensure no one deserving is deprived due to different evaluation formulae adopted by the different boards and councils.” At Scottish Church, more than 10 students have been clubbed together on the merit lists of certain subjects for scoring the same marks. The college will introduce a tie-breaker formula for them. The demand is so high that an ISC student with 97% could not get a rank of his choice. The student’s mother, Moutushi Chandar, said, “Even a 97% is not enough now. My son would have done better had there been admission tests.” Another student, who has scored 76% in Higher Secondary, has applied in seven colleges for history honours. On Tuesday, he found out he was ranked below 1,000 on most merit lists. He said, “My anxiety has increased. I am not sure what the future holds.” College authorities, however, advised patience as the same high-scorers have made it to the top of merit lists at many colleges together. Once they make their choice, colleges indicated, it would be easier for others. An official at a north Kolkata college said, “We are surprised to find students with full scores applying for political science and history.” CU results out:Calcutta University’s final semester and Part III results were declared on Tuesday. Overall pass percentage is above 99% . Colleges will give out mark sheets from 2pm on Wednesday. This is the first final semester BA and BSc results for choice-based credit system. VC Sonali Chakravarti Banerjee said, “We made it possible to publish all results in the given time frame.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/ug-seat-scarcity-looms-as-high-scorers-crowd-merit-list/articleshow/85816035.cms||Zeeshan Javed

Against this backdrop, these personnel will be trained,” said Akhilesh Singh, DIG and head RAPO. After a week-long training, these Army personnel will further augment the Army’s capabilities in their respective regiments. Interestingly, the training modules also include the study of international cases, like the Capitol Hill siege in the US that took place in 2020 and the Yellow Vests Movement case of France that took place in late 2018 and early 2019, to give them a bit of international exposure. Speaking to TOI, deputy commandant, RAPO, Harish Negi said, “The course will also include ammunition handling, fire-fighting techniques, introduction to special equipment and use of vehicles and mock drills.” This is, however, not the first time when an Army contingent is being trained at RAPO. In 2019, 15 jawans of the Kumaon Battalion were trained for controlling riots.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/raf-provides-training-to-army-personnel-on-controlling-riots-with-un-peace-missions-in-mind/articleshow/85810783.cms||Sandeep Rai

Briefing the media after the cabinet meeting in the evening, home minister Narottam Mishra said, “Son of Madhya Pradesh Vivek Sagar Prasad, as a member of the hockey team, won a bronze medal at the Tokyo Olympics. Government has taken the decision to appoint him as DSP. This is a major decision taken to promote students in the world of sports.” Mishra said that in the cabinet meeting, which was both “virtual and actual”, it was also decided to continue with the acquisition of moong and urad lentils at the rate of Rs 7,907 per quintal. In another decision, cabinet sanctioned Rs 110.84 crore for the new literacy campaign known as Bharat Sakshar Abhiyan, which is to be started in the state.  “Those children who have been deprived of education will be brought under this campaign. Government has set an aim to make everyone literate above the age of 15 years. Target has been set to make one crore people literate in the state by 2025-26,” the home minister said. In another decision, the cabinet approved Rs 186 crore for development of villages under the Prime Minister’s Adarsh Gram Yojana. “The Rs 186 crore sanctioned for the scheme will benefit 966 villages with the aim that every household gets clean drinking water and water is supplied through taps. Chief minister Chouhan had also announced that the government would work for development of villages,” Mishra said. To promote industrialization and generate more employment for the youth, cabinet decided to set-up four more industrial areas – Mohana in Indore, another in Ratlam town, Jabera also in Ratlam district and Limatra in Katni district. “Industrial areas will be developed in these four areas. For Mohana, cabinet approved 118.84 hectare of land, Ratlam town 119.84 hectare, Jabera 34.31 hectare, Limatra 124.46 hectare. There will enough space for 300 to 350 industries in these areas,” Mishra claimed.

Health experts in the state say that the Delta variant had dominated the second wave and now, a third wave may emerge in case a new variant enters the state. The health department is keeping an eye on the pandemic situation across the world, as it may affect the state as well. A health department official said that the new variant in South Africa has multiple mutations, which is why it may have increased transmissibility. He added that the state has reported cases of variants such as alpha, kappa, delta and one sample has also tested positive for delta+. The state government has established a genome sequencing laboratory at Sawai Man Singh Medical College which is conducting the genome sequencing of samples of Covid patients of different parts of the state. The samples are sent by chief medical health officers of districts in the state for genome sequencing to ensure the virus has not mutated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/state-keeps-watch-on-new-corona-variant-found-in-south-africa/articleshow/85818176.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra’s Covid cases dropped 34% in August from July, deaths down by 60%||MUMBAI: Maharashtra and Mumbai saw a sharp drop in the monthly Covid-19 cases and fatalities in August as compared to July. The state reported 1.58 lakh cases in August, nearly 34% less than the 2.39 lakh cases reported in July. Fatalities in the state reported a further decline of nearly 60% as the old and unreported deaths were not added to the tally in August. 10,846 deaths were reported in July, most of which were old deaths due to data reconciliation, while 4,522 deaths were reported in August. For the city, the August toll of 78 deaths is less than a fifth (17%) of the toll in July when 438 people succumbed to Covid-related complications, while the monthly case tally dropped by 28% from 12,557 in July to 9,048 in August. If not for the slight increase in Covid cases in the last week, Mumbai’s Covid graph would have dropped even further. On Tuesday, the state reported 4,196 cases and 104 deaths, taking the total cases to 64.64 lakh and the deaths to 1,37,313. Mumbai registered only one death and 323 cases (a slight drop from 333 cases on Monday) while the weekly growth rate of the infection stood at 0.05% (after dropping to 0.03% until two weeks ago). “If one looks at the weekly growth rate, there is no denying that cases in Mumbai have risen slightly after restrictions were relaxed two weeks back,” said Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state task force. “There seems to be a reversal in the thinning of the thick tail of Covid cases in Mumbai, but cases will hopefully not surge,” he said. While the fear of the third wave is there, BMC officials said the health infrastructure is adequate to meet any surge. AMC Suresh Kakani said BMC has worked to increase Covid-bed capacity from 21,000 during the second wave to 30,000. Dr Joshi said that as curbs continued to be removed, the administration needs to keep a watch on cases and ensure people observe Covid-appropriate behaviour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-states-covid-cases-dropped-34-in-aug-from-july-deaths-down-by-60/articleshow/85816063.cms||Bhavika Jain

---||Delhi||Delhi University clears four-year UG plan amid protests||NEW DELHI: Amidst protest, Delhi University’s Executive Council approved the four-year undergraduate programme and the multiple entry-exit system at its meeting on Tuesday. The clearance by the university’s highest statutory body means that from the 2022-23 academic session, the DU undergraduate course will span four years instead of the current three and students can enter or exit the programme at various levels. The Academic Council had cleared these proposals, which are part of the new National Education Policy, on August 24, also with some members recording their dissent. The committee for implementation of NEP had plumped for 2022-23 as the year to commence the new undergraduate structure. Rajpal Singh Panwar, EC member, said, “The matter was passed with three members dissenting. We wanted the university to defer the changes until more consultations could be held. The new system wasn’t even discussed in Parliament, only approved by the central cabinet. That is why we wanted all stakeholders to discuss the matter before adopting it.” Even as the meeting was under way, DUTA called for a social media campaign against the “anti-academic recommendations of NEP2020” that DU has gone ahead with. A statement issued by the teachers’ body said, “We condemn the fact that such a major restructuring has been bulldozed without seeking feedback from teachers through statutory bodies or allowing a threadbare discussion in the Academic Council. The fixing of 2022-23 as the year of implementation is baseless as there first needs to be detailed discussions and wider consultations on NEP 2020.” DUTA also said FYUP and MEES would increase the cost of the undergraduate programme, while students leaving the system with fewer years of study would be treated as dropouts by the job market. “MEES will only increase attrition rate giving false sense of a degree. This is an extremely ill-prepared structure which if implemented can actually end up damaging the career progression of generations of students to come,” claimed the statement. The MPhil programmes also ceased to exist, while the master’s programme will give students the option of one- or two-year course of study. At the meeting, EC finally closed the sexual harassment case related to the chemistry department. It resolved that the report of the first internal complaints committee would be accepted, not those of the several subsequently constituted committees. “This means a notice will now be issued to the former department head who was accused of sexual harassment,” explained Panwar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/du-clears-4-yr-ug-plan-amid-protests/articleshow/85816046.cms||Shradha Chettri

Investigations revealed medical superintendent of Shravasti CHC, Dr Vinay Verma, masterminded the illegal vaccination operation in his native Maanpur village in Barabanki by summoning a lab technician, Surya Pratap Singh from the CHC. Dr Verma sought to immunise his family, friends and residents of Maanpur with help of the lab technician, who arrived with vaccination kits from Shravasti. Late Saturday, when journalists enquired about the inoculation drive post-midnight, they were attacked and robbed. Cracking down on the duo, chief medical officer, Shravasti, A P Bhargav, suspended the technician, Surya Pratap Singh, divested Dr Verma of his charge and wrote to the district magistrate recommending action against him. Superintendent of police, Barabanki, Yamuna Prasad, said, investigations are underway into the attack on journalists. A four-member team comprising additional CMO (administration) Barabanki, Dr KNN Tripathi, district immunisation officers Dr Rajiv Kumar Singh and Chatrik Singh, and superintendent of CHC, Dr Sunil Jaiswal, have been constituted to probe into the incident. On August 28, when journalists got a wind of the late-night vaccination, they rushed to the spot, but were attacked for recording the event and asking questions. Health workers and villagers deployed by Dr Verma snatched mobile phones, damaged cameras and looted cash from the media persons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/chc-medical-supt-to-face-dept-probe-lab-tech-suspended/articleshow/85818220.cms||---

The TNHB had demolished thousands of flats at Thomas Park, the district forest officer compound at Race Course and Kavundampalayam in 2012. The state government had subsequently allotted Rs 512 crore to the TNHB to construct 1,848 apartment-type flats at Kavundamapalayam, where construction work began on March 2, 2016. The TNHB has constructed four types of flats – A, B, C and D.

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Peeping Tom sweeper in mall films woman in toilet, arrested||KOLKATA: A sweeper at a shopping mall in New Town was arrested on Monday for allegedly peeping into women’s toilet and filming an occupant. A shopper had gone to the washroom at Axis Mall around 9pm on Sunday when she realized that someone was peeping into the cubicle from top and filming her. She raised an alarm, ran out and caught a glimpse of the accused locking himself in the next cubicle. As she screamed at the door, the accused reportedly shoved the door open and fled, knocking the woman down. Within the next few moments, he fled the mall, police said. The woman, a resident of CE Block in New Town, first approached the mall authorities and then, lodged a complaint at the New Town police station. “The incident took place around 9pm on Sunday and by the time we reached the mall, most of the employees had left. We checked CCTV footage and recorded the man’s ID. The next morning, we made the mall authorities to call him to his workplace, from where he was arrested,” said a senior Bidhannagar Commissionerate officer. Police said the accused, Goutam Mondal (30) from Sonarpur, initially claimed he had accidentally entered the washroom to clean it without knowing the woman was still inside but later, he confessed to the crime. Cops are checking his cellphone to see whether he had more pictures. A senior Axis Mall official apologized for the incident and promised to help the police. “We have provided them with CCTV footage and the person’s background details. He is not a direct employee and was employed by a third party service provider,” the official said. Mondal has been booked for voyeurism, stalking and voluntarily causing hurt. A Barrackpore court remanded him in judicial custody.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/peeping-tom-sweeper-in-mall-films-woman-in-toilet-arrested/articleshow/85816091.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Nagpur||‘It’s a fight for dal-chawal by Ganga Jamuna CSWs’||Sex worker-turned-activist Kiran Deshmukh, president of National Network of Sex Workers, had reached Nagpur from western Maharashtra to support women in Ganga Jamuna where police have banned prostitution from mid-August leaving 3,500-4,000 residents in the lurch and throwing about 1,500 commercial sex workers (CSWs) off the livelihood. In an exclusive chat with Soumitra Bose, Deshmukh touched upon various aspects of the police action and its fallout. Excerpts: Q. What is your assessment of the Ganga Jamuna episode amid police action and agitation? A. The logic of ‘public place’ and ‘200 metres’ are farcical here as the place is almost 300 years old and was gifted by kings for the entertainment of their army. The so-called public places had come up at Ganga Jamuna knowing very well its past and present occupations. The question is why those public places like school, police chowki and such establishments were set up in the first place knowing well it is a red-light area. These were set up for the locals, but now being held as a premise to derail their livelihood. If one shifts the sex workers elsewhere, even that place would turn into a public place eventually. Q. The police department has taken action only after complaints of illegal activities. Aren’t you supporting them? A. If a full-fledged police chowki is there at Ganga Jamuna, then why did the cops allow illegal activities to thrive in the first place to such extent that local residents had to approach police commissioner? Let us underline the fact again that Ganga Jamuna and the profession practised therein came up 300 years ago. Why did other residents move in there knowing well in advance that it’s a red-light area? Now, local residents are trying to push the people out who had been there before them. Q. What do the sex workers want now? Rehabilitation or continuation of sex work sans illegality like minors and soliciting? A. Police want to evict us in the name of rehabilitation and grab our properties. Why thrust rehabilitation on sex workers when they don’t want it? Let it be voluntary. We have homes, our livelihood was in place in the form of sex work and were capable of feeding our families and dependents. Many sex workers had discontinued to be in the trade on their own. One woman from Ganga Jamuna had recently returned to her native place bidding the sex work adieu. We are fine with such voluntary decision. Q. What is the future of the agitation by sex workers? A. It’s a fight for dal-chawal for the sex workers. It’s a question of existence now. We are fighting for our individual rights and rights of our families. We will fight till the end, whatever it may be.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/its-a-fight-for-dal-chawal-by-ganga-jamuna-csws/articleshow/85816086.cms||Soumitra Bose

While over 96% of the elderly population in the state received the first dose, just 55% turned up for the second. Almost 40% of the elderly population that received the first dose has missed out on the second, which is a cause of concern. A health department official said, “The health minister has already raised the issue with the Centre. He had demanded 2 crore doses from the Centre for August against an allocation of 54 lakh doses. Around 80 lakh people people had become eligible for second dose in August.” Out of 68.33 lakh elderly population in the state, 65.64 lakh received the first dose, which was 96.1% of the eligible or targeted elderly population for vaccination. But, only 35.84 lakh elderly population has received the second dose, which is just 54.6% of the elderly population who received the first dose. Still more than 29.79 lakh are yet to receive the second dose. “In Jaipur, we vaccinated more than 44 lakh people. Out of them, 32 lakh are first doses and 12 lakh second. Vaccination of elderly population with second dose remained affected due to irregular supply of vaccine. Also, a large number of people who have not received the first dose are reaching the vaccination centres in increased numbers. Now, we are encouraging those whose are due for second dose,” said Dr Narrrottam Sharma, chief medical healthofficer (Jaipur -I). The vaccination for above 60 population started on March 1. Till May 31, as many as 53.55 lakh elderly population was vaccinated with first dose and 16.63 lakh of those had received the second dose. If three months’ gap between the first and second dose is maintained, 53.55 lakh above 60 population have become eligible for the second dose till August 31. But, out of those, 35.84 lakh have received the second dose, while 17.71 lakh are yet to receive it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/29l-senior-citizens-yet-to-get-2nd-dose-of-covid-vax-in-raj/articleshow/85818218.cms||Syed Intishab Ali

The tree was replanted on August 6 and on August 29, public efforts yielded results as there was growth of new leaves and buds. The 25-feet high tree uprooted near a temple was worshipped by the women for a long time. It also provided shadow to people and animals from schorching sunlight in summer. When the tree was uprooted, the sacred threads tied around it after a recent festival attracted the attention of the passersbys. “They would take away the thread as they revered them but would ignore the tree,” said a local resident. But activists of Motichoor Nadi Bachao Samiti decided to replant it as during the coronavirus outbreak, they learned the importance iof trees and the fresh oxygen generated by them. Rajesh Rai, a member of the samiti said, “we noticed that the tree was very heavy and bulky so we arranged an earth moving machine and a tractor.” It was not possible to load the tree in the tractor so the machine dragged it to a nearby place in a crematorium premises. Rakesh Suman, another member said, “the machine was used to dig up a 10-feet deep trench and the tree was replanted there.” The activists also watered the tree with the help of a water tanker till there was a good spell of rain. They said, “every day we would monitor the tree. On August 29, we found the growth of new buds,” Rakesh said. It was one of the happiest moments, he said. The members of this samiti had earlier revived a river named Motichoor in Bina.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/50-yr-old-banyan-uprooted-by-wind-in-bina-replanted/articleshow/85816053.cms||---

Misrod police on Tuesday claimed that the robbed car was spotted in Harda. Police scanned the CCTV cameras on Hoshangabad Road from ISBT to Gyarah Meel in which they claimed to have found the appearance of the accused matching with a Harda-based history sheeter. Four police teams are investigating the case. SHO Misrod Niranjan Sharma said, complainant Shahrukh Khan told police that on Sunday morning around 5.30 am, he had parked his car outside ISBT and was waiting for a booking. A youth approached him around the same time and said that he wanted to go till Gyarah Meel Bypass. Shahrukh asked him to book the cab online but the accused lured him with Rs 500, to take him to his destination without booking. He boarded the taxi when Shahrukh agreed and they reached Gyarah Meel area around 6 am. Within a few minutes, an accomplice of the accused passenger reached the spot on a stolen bike and both fled after robbing the car at gun point. The accused abandoned the stolen bike between Mandideep and Obedullaganj, which was recovered by police. Cops found that bike was following the car from ISBT, which suggests that they had pre-planned the crime.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/car-loot-case-cops-now-claim-vehicle-was-spotted-in-harda/articleshow/85816080.cms||---
---||Kozhikode||Warring INL factions on reconciliation path||Kozhikode: One month after the split in Indian National League (INL), reconciliation talks in the party are showing signs of success. The talks mediated by Sunni leader Kanthapuram AP Aboobacker Musaliyar and his son Abdul Hakeem Azhari over the last several days seem to have yielded positive results in setting the stage to bring the two warring factions together. INL state general secretary Kasim Irikkur said that they have almost reached a consensus on reinstating party state president AP Abdul Wahab, who was removed from the post by the national leadership, when he returns. The strong stand taken by CPM that INL can continue in LDF only as a unified entity and that it will not accept any one of the factions in the front is learnt to have hastened the reconciliation talks. “Reconciliation efforts have covered much ground. We will accept those who have left the party if they return. If everyone wishes the party to return to its previous stature, we can achieve reconciliation at the earliest,” Irikkur told the media in Kozhikode. Wahab too expressed hope that the reconciliation efforts will bear fruit. “We had taken the initiative for mediation and have extended our support by not allowing the issues in the party to escalate. However, it is also important that the issues which had caused the rift in the party will be resolved through mediation,” he added. Though the national leadership stood behind Irikkur faction, CPM had remained equidistant from both factions following the split and had given an ultimatum to sort out issues. The party had also taken a stand that the factions will not be invited for LDF’s meeting if they fail to reconcile.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/warring-inl-factions-on-reconciliation-path/articleshow/85816101.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||For high-end cars, up to 5% tax bump around the bend in Ahmedabad||AHMEDABAD: From October, high-end sports utility vehicles (SUVs) in Ahmedabad will become more expensive. The AMC’s revenue committee has suggested a hike in vehicle taxes. The rate was 3%, but now a rise has been proposed in the 3.5% to 5% range. For instance, vehicles that cost Rs 15 lakh will be dearer by Rs 7,500, while those that cost Rs 50 lakh and above will get costlier by Rs 1 lakh. To discourage people from buying high-end cars, the civic body has decided to hike the lifetime vehicle tax for vehicles in the price range of Rs 15 lakh to Rs 50 lakh. Currently, the vehicle tax stands at a flat 3% of the basic value of the vehicle for all private four-wheelers. From October, buyers of vehicles in the price range of Rs 15 lakh to Rs 24.9 lakh will have to pay 3.5% of the basic price. The buyers of vehicles in the price range of Rs 25 lakh to Rs 49.9 lakh will have to pay 4% of the basic price. Vehicles costing Rs 50 lakh and above will attract the tax of 5% of the basic price. The proposed tax structure will be implemented from October 1. “As part of the National Air Quality Monitoring Programme (NAQMP), we have decided to waive vehicle taxes for electric vehicles (EVs),” said an AMC official. “We expect that this will encourage buyers to opt for EVs, reducing pollution from burning of fossil fuels.” There is no change in vehicle tax for two-wheelers, autorickshaws, loading rickshaws, four-wheeler loading tempos, and mini-trucks. The AMC’s revenue committee will pass the proposal to hike vehicle taxes, which will be brought to the standing committee’s approval and finally it will be sent for the state government’s nod.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/for-high-end-cars-up-to-5-tax-bump-around-the-bend/articleshow/85818254.cms||---

Acquitting the biker, Hemant Hatkar, it said the prosecution had not produced any evidence which connected him to the alleged offence. “In the circumstance, it is clear that the prosecution has failed to establish that the accused drove his motor vehicle on a public road in a rash and negligent manner, endangering human life or personal safety of others, and thereby causing the death of the woman, Mudrika Kamble,” the court said. It added the prosecution could not prove he had failed to provide her medical assistance and report the matter to the nearest police station, both of which are punishable offences. It was alleged on August 10, 2017, Kamble was attempting to cross the highway near Chembur Central Gate. An unknown vehicle rammed into her and she suffered a serious head injury. Sunita Ghodke, Kamble’s relative, and others gathered and took her to Rajawadi Hospital. Three days later, she passed away. During investigation, the accused was found to be involved. He was booked for causing death by negligence. In court, Ghodke deposed she found an injured Kamble when she was passing by and saw a crowd. The court said her evidence makes it clear she was not an eyewitness. “Her evidence is not useful to ascertain the manner in which Mudrika Kamble sustained injury. In fact, no eyewitness is available to the prosecution. Hence, it is clear that there is no ocular evidence regarding the incident in question,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-not-clear-if-biker-rode-rashly-caused-death-says-court/articleshow/85818287.cms||---

The cost of a 2,500-3,000litre water tanker varies from Rs500 to Rs800, up by Rs150 to Rs400, depending upon the acuteness of the crisis and water availability in the region. Several districts in the Bundelkhand region, including Chhatarpur, Panna, Damoh, Sagar and Tikamgarh have been witnessing a water crisis because of scanty rainfall. While Panna was 40% rain deficient on Tuesday, Chhatarpur was rain deficient by 27%, while Damoh and Sagar’s rain deficiency was by 46% and 20% respectively. In most of the places in the region, water is supplied through tubewells and the number of houses connected with pipe lines is few. “Monsoon in 2020 was also not good. This year, so far, it has also been disappointing”, said a weather official. “The water table has gone down drastically in many regions, especially in upper regions such as Buxwah, leading to a water crisis,” he added. “Residents are forced to fetch water from tanker suppliers who transport the commodity from tubewells in rural areas”, he said. Water is purchased both for domestic use as well for construction work, residents said. Beni Prasad Jatav of ward number 2 in Lavkush Nagar said he had to pay double the amount for water. “From Rs400, the tanker operators were now charging Rs800”, he said. Many people in the region have to spend more thanRs2,000 for water every month.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/chhatarpur-reels-under-water-crisis/articleshow/85816126.cms||---

The steering committee will oversee smooth execution of the MoU that had earlier been signed between the state health department and Tata Medical Mumbai for the cancer care hospitals. The panel comprises 13 members, 10 from the health department and three from Tata Medical, and will meet at least once in four months. In June, chief minsiter Mamata Banerjee had announced the tie-up for the two hospitals, one to be founded at IPGMER and the other one at North Bengal Medical College in Siliguri. “A large number of cancer patients from Bengal go for treatment at the Mumbai facility. The idea of setting up the two cancer units, in collaboration with Tata Medical Mumbai, is to offer quality treatment in Bengal so that patients don’t have to travel to Mumbai,” said a Swasthya Bhawan official. While timely implementation of the cancer units at IPGMER and Sliguri is one of the terms of referral for the steering committee, the team will also work on various aspect of cancer care. These will include study of oncology facility in Bengal, such as areas requiring strengthening, systematic mapping of facilities for diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation, integration of cancer care with cancer education, public health and research, mapping of management aspects, and government funding.

---||Lucknow||Soon, helicopter taxi service to connect tourism destinations in Uttar Pradesh||LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh tourism department has decided to launch chopper taxi service to connect prominent destinations across the state. The service is likely to begin from December this year. With many people avoiding overcrowded trains and flights in view of Covid-19 pandemic, the tourism department feels the ‘fast and luxurious’ option could find many takers in UP. Officials said that while the heliport in Agra is ready, the process to prepare heliports at places of other tourism significance has begun. The project would be based on the private-public partnership (PPP) model and to find suitable private players, a consultant would be appointed in two weeks, confirmed principal secretary, tourism and culture, Mukesh Kumar Meshram. Talking to TOI, he said there are tourists who don’t want to travel in crowded transportation mediums like trains and aeroplanes more so after the Corona pandemic outbreak. There are also many who can afford the expensive choppers, he said, adding the helicopter taxi service would cater to the needs of such tourists. Most of the tourists, especially foreigners, visit Agra to see the Taj Mahal because of good connectivity but same tourists skip equally important other tourist destinations due to poor connectivity. “This service will give an option to such people,” said another official. For many routes, the service will ensure tourists reach destinations and return back in a day, Meshram said. Other than Agra, which is very near to New Delhi, there are other important destinations which would certainly be explored by tourists if they are able to save time, he said. Besides a heliport near Agra airport, Meshram said the government already had an airport at Vindhyachal, Prayagraj, Lucknow and Varanasi etc. According to officials, an Agra-like heliport with basic amenities to run the service is also being constructed at Mathura and Prayagraj. To ensure that tourists stays for a night in Varanasi, the helicopter service to nearby destinations like Chandauli-based Chandraprabha Wildlife, 12 to 15 minutes of Ganga Darshan and ghats of Varanasi will also be started. Similarly, helicopters would be available for tourists to Buddhist sites in Bodhgaya, Kushinagar etc. Helicopter services would also be available for nearby tourist destinations in Lucknow and also places like Imambara, Residency, Roomi Darwaza, etc in the state capital. For places like Dudhwa tiger reserve, the department is planning to use the runway strip. “Runway strips will be used for helicopter landing at places where there are no heliports,” said Meshram.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/soon-heli-taxi-service-to-connect-tourism-destinations-in-state/articleshow/85818247.cms||Rajiv Srivastava

---||Lucknow||Every household in Lucknow will get PNG by 2023-end, says Union defence minister Rajnath Singh||LUCKNOW: Piped natural gas (PNG) connections will be provided to every household in the city by the end of 2023. Besides, within a year, around 80 streets in the state capital will be converted into “smart roads” and an underground parking lot will come up in Hazratganj opposite the district magistrate’s official residence. These initiatives are among 70 projects worth Rs 397 crore whose foundation was laid by Lucknow MP and Union defence minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday. Other projects include treatment plants for drains discharging into the river Gomti, using phytoremediation technique, laying of sewer pipeline in several areas, revival of three cremation grounds and rainwater harvesting plants at LMC office. Singh also inaugurated 110 projects worth Rs 1,313 crore on the occasion. These included Chowk flyover, Kisan Path, STP at Avantibai and Balrampur hospitals, solar power system at Hathi Park, health ATMs, EWS and LIG flats at CG City, musical fountain at Clock Tower, 57 smart roads and free Wi-Fi at six parks, among others. The function held at the amphitheatre at Jyotiba Phule multi-level parking in Chowk was also attended by chief minister Yogi Adityanath, deputy chief ministers Dinesh Sharma and Keshav Prasad Maurya, law minister Brajesh Pathak and mayor Sanyukta Bhatia, among others. Announcing that his aim is to make Lucknow the number one city in the country, Singh said, “I have been informed by Green Gas Ltd that a target has been set to provide PNG to each household in Lucknow which will reduce the consumption of LPG.” The 2.2km Chowk flyover constructed by UP Bridge Corporation will benefit more than 50,000 commuters traveling between Rajajipuram, Chowk, Aishbagh and Victoria Street. The flyover will also reduce the travelling time between Victoria Street and KGMU from 25 minutes to just 10 minutes. A part of the under-construction Ring Road, the 11km Kisan Path, was also formally opened for people. Built at a cost of Rs 280 crore, the route connects Sultanpur Road to Faizabad Road. Similarly, 57 roads constructed at a cost of Rs 125 crore under Smart Cities Mission were also dedicated to the public. Singh said he was able to take up development projects on a large scale in his parliamentary constituency only because Yogi Adityanath is the chief minister. “The entire Ring Road will be ready by October 2022 and it will only be possible because of Yogi ji’s governance,” he said and added, “Deputy chief minister Keshav Maurya has also helped me.” Singh also said that the interest of the CM and his deputies in the development of the state is the reason behind the speedy progress of UP. He appreciated the CM’s efforts to take care of children orphaned due to Covid-19. Praising the law and order situation in UP, Singh said that the heartbeat of criminals stops if they hear Yogi’s name. He also said that 90% of India’s population has been benefited by one or the other scheme of the BJP government at the Centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/every-household-in-lucknow-will-get-png-by-23-end-rajnath/articleshow/85818292.cms||Pranchal Srivastava

But if you are one of those who haven’t heard about it, or if you don’t remember it, here’s a good time to retell the tale. Mariyappan Thangavelu was five and was on his way to school when a drunken driver at the wheel of a bus in interior Tamil Nadu ran over his right leg, crushing his knee and leaving him with a permanent disability. But Mariyappan never gave up and on Tuesday, the 26-year-old followed up his Rio gold with a silver in the T63 high jump at the Paralympics in Tokyo. Compatriot Sharad Kumar ran him close with a bronze while the gold went to Sam Grewe of the US with 1.88m. Mariyappan became the third Indian after Joginder Singh Bedi and Devendra Jhajharia to win multiple medals at the Paralympics. But it hasn’t been easy. The Tamil Nadu para-athlete missed practice sessions ahead of the event. He was quarantined for a week as he came in close contact with a Covid-19 positive person on the flight to Tokyo. Being in quarantine meant that Mariyappan, the original choice to be India’s flag-bearer at the opening ceremony, had to make way for Tek Chand. ‘Mariyappan’s mental strength was the key’Mariyappan revealed that he remained positive despite testing times. “It was tough to not be part of the opening ceremony. I was a little disturbed (mentally) at that point of time. But the important thing for me was to stay focused and not let any negativity affect me,” he told TOI. “The good news was that all my results were negative for the Covid-19 tests conducted and as the practice sessions commenced it was back to business for me,” Mariyappan told TOI. As the event commenced, persistent rain made the conditions tough. “The weather made a big difference. It became slippery and that affected not just me but everyone’s performance, said Mariyappan. “But despite all that, I am just pleased to have given it my all and very happy to have won a silver,” he added. Sathyanarayana, Mariyappan’s long-time coach, felt the silver was a reflection of the para-athlete’s mental fortitude. “He remained determined and even during the quarantine phase -- Mariyappan will not compromise on his daily exercise routine and perform stretches inside his room. This medal is a tribute to his mental toughness,” Sathyanarayana said. The wet conditions notwithstanding, Mariyappan began on a strong note clearing 1.73m in his very first attempt. Sharad too cleared that height in the first go. When the height was increased to 1.77m, both Mariyappan and Sharad had little trouble going past it. Subsequently, both Mariyappan and Sharad crossed heights of 1.80m and 1.83m to remain in contention for the podium finish. However, when the bar was raised to 1.86m, Mariyappan breached it in his third and final attempt while Sharad failed to do so. Sharad’s event ended at that point but not before finishing with a bronze. As the bar touched 1.88m -- only Mariyappan and Sam were left in the fray. But while Mariyappan couldn’t cross it in his three attempts, Sam did so in the third and final chance to win the coveted yellow metal. CM announces Rs 2 crore, PM congratulates MariyappanChief minister M K Stalin congratulated the Indian team for its success and announced a Rs 2 crore prize for Mariyappan Thangavelu for winning silver medal in the Tokyo Palaralympics. PM Modi, who congratulated Mariyappan over phone, said it was a wonderful sign that India’s medal-winners are coming from different parts of the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/mariyappan-goes-the-distance-to-win-silver-2nd-medal/articleshow/85816162.cms||Prasad RS
---||Delhi||Bidhuri urges Baijal to order probe into EWS admissions||New Delhi: Leader of the Opposition in Delhi assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri on Tuesday urged lieutenant governor Anil Baijal to order a CBI probe into alleged misuse of admission quota in Delhi schools for economically weaker section (EWS) category. In a statement, the BJP functionary alleged that the AAP government is violating the admission norms under EWS category to favour children of illegal migrants from Bangladesh and Myanmar. “It is well-known that illegal migrants from these two countries have the support of the AAP government and many of these illegal migrants have also been involved in criminal activities. The Delhi government is not only providing them with free rations that have been provided by the central government for the residents of Delhi, but also free electricity. And now, they are being provided admissions in schools under the EWS category, which was meant for the poor children of the residents of Delhi,” claimed Bidhuri. “A number of such cases have come to light where illegal migrants have got preference in admissions,” Bidhuri said, adding that it needs to be probed. No reaction from the AAP government was available despite TOI making an attempt.

---||Nagpur||‘Need tribunal in Nagpur to solve CBSE teachers’ issues’||Nagpur: Had it not been for the deadly second Covid wave, CBSE school teachers could have got their own district-level tribunal by now, according to a city association fighting for CBSE teachers’ rights. CBSE Schools’ Staff Welfare Association (CSSWA) president Deepali Dably said that the central board had written to the Nagpur district education officer in February about providing a platform to address CBSE teachers’ problems. “We agitated at Samvidhan Chowk in January and by mid-February, CBSE had dashed off a letter to the local education office. Then we were hit by a brutal second wave of Covid-19 which later spread across the country, and due to that the entire process of setting up a tribunal was put on hold,” said Dably. CSSWA for the last couple of years has been raising issues about staff employed at CBSE schools. Dably said, “If a teacher has been wronged, where does s/he go to complain? CBSE is a board based in New Delhi and has no representative in Nagpur. We want that in every district there should be a competent authority that can focus on these issues.” Dably said that after their letter to the Prime Minister’s Office about this issue, things started to move ahead. “The letter was forwarded to HRD ministry (now renamed ministry of education), which in turn asked CBSE to take cognizance. Then in February CBSE sent a letter to Nagpur zilla parishad, making it very clear that the latter is the competent authority to address teacher’s issues,” said Dably. The letter also asks ZP to have a separate wing for CBSE teachers, claims Dably. “This way there will be no mixing of issues and pendency of matters. Now with Covid-19 cases at the their lowest, we are confident that a tribunal shall be set up soon in Nagpur to address CBSE teachers’ problems,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/need-tribunal-in-nagpur-to-solve-cbse-teachers-issues/articleshow/85816174.cms||Abhishek Choudhari
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ‘Hosp mgmts will be held responsible in case of fire’||Mumbai: The state government has directed hospitals to ensure their electrical systems are maintained and serviced as per guidelines and in case of any fire the management will be held responsible. An energy department order stated that guidelines have been issued to hospitals in the state to ensure their electrical systems and appliances are well maintained as per the Code of Practice for Electrical Wiring Installations, Requirements for Electrical Installations in Medical locations and as per central electricity authority regulation 2010. “Hospitals have been told to follow guidelines and if they do not, in case of any untoward incident, the management will be held responsible,” said a department official. This came after fires in hospitals in Bhandara, Mumbai, Nagpur and Virar. The order said hospitals have to ensure power supply is uninterrupted and safety of the supply network. Periodic monitoring and inspection of high pressure and medium pressure feeders, checking that the power load in hospitals does not exceed the sanctioned load, are some of the steps to be taken by the hospital. Hospitals in buildings taller than 15 metres have to inspect internal electrical systems within a year of issuance of the no objection certificate guidelines by the electrical inspector. Energy minister Nitin Raut said since the pandemic there has been a lot of stress on public and private hospitals. Fires at hospitals were due to improper maintenance of electrical equipment. The government move was to ensure safety of hospital staff and patients. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-hosp-mgmts-will-be-held-responsible-in-case-of-fire/articleshow/85816200.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan government eyes Rs 50 crore revenue via land use change||JAIPUR: By changing the land use and issuing commercial lease deeds under the Gopalpura bypass special development plan, the state government intends to earn a revenue of approximately Rs 50 crore. As per the survey, there are 213 available plots on the commercial land measuring a 42,600 square metre area. The land use rate and commercial lease deed calculation are based on 40% of the reserve price of the zone. The proposal reads, “While almost all the plots are commercial in nature, only few has paid for the commercial lease deeds. Therefore, there is clear loss of revenue to the development authority.” The civic body has decided to initiate the pilot project between Tonk Road and Gujjar Ki Thadi as there is commercial land-use corridor of 72 m on both the sides of the roads as per the master plan. Apart from this, the department has also incorporated parking provisions to earn revenue. “Car parking will be provided on all plots. parking has to be on existing plots, if a car parking is not provided, a fine of Rs 1 lakh per ECU has to be paid,” said an official. An official said, an ECU is the parking space which has to be provided in a building, based on its built-up space (floor area), for parking vehicles, including car, scooter, light vehicles, etc. Currently,1 ECS per 75 sqm of built-up area is the norm for commercial buildings. The common parking will also be a revenue stream for the civic body with users charged Rs 5 per hour for two-wheelers and Rs10 per hour for four-wheelers. “The civic body can earn a revenue of 7,15,000 per month from this stretch after imposing parking charges.” Under the project, the JDA proposes to provide common parking for 950 equivalent car unit (ECU) in the development corridor. It is estimated, total parking required including visitors will be 1,420 ECU. The extra parking spaces will be fulfilled after development of parking on commercial plots. The proposal reads, “There are 213 commercial plots, having an approximately area of 42,600 square metre assuming the average plot size area is 200 square metre. The new commercial destination will have to provide 1 (ECU) for every 75 square metre of built-up. The total parking required including visitors will be 1420 ECU (1,136+ 25% visitors).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/govt-eyes-rs-50cr-revenue-via-land-use-change/articleshow/85818332.cms||---

Disaster management department authorities told TOI that the heavy rainfall caused a landslide at Kannad in Aurangabad, which received 110mm rain till 8.30am on Tuesday. During the 24 hour-period till 8.30am on Tuesday, triple-digit rainfall was observed in Dahanu (220mm), Palghar agri (130mm), Vasai (110mm), Pathardi (180mm), Beed, Kannad, Ashti, Ambejogai (110mm each), and Mukhed (100mm), Met department data showed. Heavy showers lashed at least 16 other locations in Maharashtra till Tuesday morning, particularly in Marathwada, Konkan-Goa and isolated spots in Madhya Maharashtra. Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather forecasting division, IMD Pune, told TOI, “The low-pressure system over the Bay of Bengal, which was responsible for the extremely heavy to very heavy showers in isolated parts of Maharashtra moved west north-westwards with quite a fast pace and weakened into an upper air cyclonic circulation over west Vidarbha and neighbourhood on Tuesday. Had the movement of the system been slow, it would have resulted in a much more intense spell. From September 1, there would be a significant drop in the rainfall activity over the state.” Kashyapi said good spell of rainfall could revisit the state around September 6 onwards. For Wednesday, IMD has forecast heavy to very heavy rains at isolated places in Palghar, and heavy rains at isolated places in Thane, Mumbai, Raigad, Ratnagiri, Dhule, Nandurbar and Nashik. Moderate rainfall in most other districts in Madhya Maharashtra, including Pune ghats, is expected on Wednesday. Pune city is likely to experience only light showers on Wednesday, followed by very light to light rainfall till September 6.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/triple-digit-rain-in-parts-of-maha-city-to-get-light-showers-till-sept-6/articleshow/85816221.cms||Neha Madaan

As nationally more than a crore doses were administered on Tuesday, Pune district created its own record by delivering over 2 lakh doses in a day. A total of 1.44 crore doses were administered in August in the state, up from 1.19 crore in July, numbers from CoWin revealed. Public health minister Rajesh Tope said the state was expecting 1.7 crore doses from the Centre in September. “We usually get 1.20 crore doses, so this month we hope to receive 50 lakh more,” he said. As on Tuesday, Maharashtra had administered 5,90,28,840 doses, which included complete vaccination of 1.59 crore people. Mumbai has also seen a 13% rise in vaccinations in August, compared to July. The city has administered over 21.34 lakh doses, up from 18.88 lakh in July roughly. Civic officials said the city has infrastructure to deliver upto 2 lakh doses in a day. But the only handicap was availability of doses. Mumbai has administered 97,49,302 doses till now, the highest in the state. On Tuesday, limited centres were open for vaccination as the city got 85,000 doses in the last instalment. Dr Mangala Gomare, BMC’s executive health officer, said the city received 85,000 doses on Monday, which will sustain for few days. Due to the truncated drive on Tuesday, the city administered only 54,722 doses, even as more than 8,18,216 doses were administered in Maharashtra. After Tuesday’s bumper performance, the doses given in Pune reached 81,31,030.

Clasrooms have been sanitised, sanitiser bottles have been placed in various places and students and teachers have to pass through a thermometer check before physical classes begin. Authorities said online classes will continue but physical classes, especially for science subjects, were needed. Edward Olivera, member of St Anselm School, Mansarover, said they are fully geared up for the opening with all the precautions as per the government’s guidelines. “We are prepared for tomorrow and expect students to turn up. Around 30% parents have given consent but numbers may rise.” Maharaja Sawai Man Singh Vidhyalaya has made all the arrangements as per student strength of the classes. Damodar Goyal, member of school board, said junior classes should also open soon. “We are happy classes 9 to 12 are opening up with 50% attendance. Other class students should also be allowed.” Some parents are not sending students because most institutes haven’t started transportation facilities. Without bus services, parents will have to drop their children to school and therefore they prefer giving online education instead. Maharani Gayatri Devi School along with a few other institutes will remain closed this week and resume classes from Monday. Bhartiya Vidhya Bhavan Vidhyashram School’s principal Pratima Sharma said parents need to realise that schools are important not just for academic development, but for overall development of their child. Most parents unwilling to send kids to school:As schools reopen from Wednesday, majority of the parents are still apprehensive about sending their kids to school. According to information from different schools, around 20% to 30% have given written consent to send their wards for physical classes for classes 9 to 12. With kids yet to be vaccinated, parents continue to be a worried lot. Nandini Jain, mother a class 10 student, said she was not ready to send her son to school the vaccination process of students was yet to start. “I agree that our children are grown up, but sending them to school is not an option because the third wave may hit any time,” said Jain. Kishore Sharma, father of a class 11 student, said he was not ready to send his daughter to school as close contact with other students might impact her health. Abhishek Jain Bittu, spokesperson of Sayunkt Abhibhavak Sangh, said majority of parents were not ready to send their wards to school. He added government was risking lives of students who are not yet vaccinated. “The government is risking lives of thousands of students. We are keeping a close watch and if any private school is found violating guidelines issued by government regarding school reopening, FIR will be filed against them. We are concerned about wellbeing of our students while the government is aiming to collect fees,” said Jain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/raj-schools-reopen-today-under-strict-covid-guidelines/articleshow/85818383.cms||---

While hearing a suo motu PIL (No3/2021), a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Kilor on Tuesday issued notices to the respondents, including the Central and state governments, asking them to reply within two weeks. The Union ministry of environment, forest and climate control (MOEFCC), central pollution control board (CPCB) in Delhi, state department of environment and climate change, Maharashtra pollution control board (MPCB) and Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) have been made the other respondents in the petition. Last week, while dismissing a case of (POP) idol makers for lifting prohibition enforced by the NMC on their products, the HC had directed its registry to file a suo motu PIL on the after effects of immersing idols in water bodies, which is later used for human and animal consumption, and appointed Shreerang Bhandarkar as amicus curiae assisted by Sejal Lakhani. The same bench had asked the amicus to prepare a comprehensive PIL that should deal with grave issues broadly pertaining to environmental pollution and damage, and also for framing guidelines to regulate, govern and operate PoP’s use. Bhandarkar and Lakhani prayed for directives to the respondents to strictly implement the CPCB’s revised guidelines of May 12, 2020 for idol immersion in true letter and spirit. They also requested the Centre and state to ask NMC to take all possible measures to prevent water pollution, keep a check on idol makers and prosecute defaulters by meting out punishment and levying fine. The amicus further insisted that authorities should constitute a committee to conduct a scientific study to assess the impact of PoP, its potential to cause pollution in the environment and water bodies and to suggest remedies. He requested the respondents to submit a report regarding their preparation for implementing CPCB’s guidelines during the forthcoming Ganesh festival from September 10. He also demanded directives to script a modality for changing as well as combating the current environmental crisis that has evolved due to overuse of non-biodegradable substances for various purposes like POP.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/amicus-seeks-rules-banning-use-of-pop/articleshow/85816226.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Pune||Heavy spells spark release of water from Panshet||Pune: Catchments of the dams in the Khadakwasla irrigation circle received spells of rains on Tuesday leading to release of water from Panshet reservoir. This resulted in flowing of water into the Khadakwasla dam. The irrigation department has brought down Khadakwasla’s storage to 40% of its total capacity to accommodate water released from Panshet and Varasgaon that are holding 100% stock. “Water release has been initiated from Panshet to make space for rainwater flowing into the reservoir. A similar release may begin from Varasgaon if the rainfall continues for a longer period. Both the reservoirs have already reached to their full capacities,” a state irrigation department official said. While the collective storage in the four dams was at 94% on Tuesday, it was less than last year’s storage of 99% at the end of August. The irrigation department, however, stated that the low stock would not affect water availability for Pune as of now. “Water is being lifted by the civic body as per its requirements. There has been no curtailment in the daily water availability. The stock in Bhama Askhed is at 89% and the dam is supplying water to the city’s eastern parts,” an official said. Irrigation department records revealed that the dams have not reported any alarming rise in the stock in the past two weeks due to the weak rainfall. The official said water stock has recorded a slight dip. “The rain resumed since yesterday and the stocks will go up again if heavy spells continue for the next few days,” the official said. On Tuesday, Temghar reported over 15mm rainfall, while Panshet and Varasgaon received over 10mm rains. Pavana dam that supplies water to Pimpri Chinchwad received over 30mm rainfall. The collective storage in 35 major reservoits in the Bhima basin was at 82% at the end of August. This was around 12% less than the collective storage the dams had last year on August 31. The India India Meteorological Department had forecast revival of monsoon in Maharashtra, albeit briefly, due to a low-pressure system over the Bay of Bengal. The IMD had, however, said the rainfall revival would not only be a result of the southward shift of the monsoon trough, but also due to the movement of the low-pressure area and slight strengthening of the westerly winds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/heavy-spells-spark-release-of-water-from-panshet/articleshow/85816242.cms||Sarang Dastane
---||Mumbai||ICMR tool to help states gear up for third Covid wave||MUMBAI: The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) plans to give the Covid-19 preparedness simulator it has developed to all states to enable them to efficiently prepare for future Covid waves. The simulator uses local epidemiological data to project a possible surge in Covid cases. State or district-specific epidemiological data can be fed for state-specific projection of another wave, which could be used to plan for action and resources needed, Dr Samiran Panda, senior scientist and head of ICMR’s epidemiology and communicable diseases division, told TOI. For instance, Panda said once states feed the data into the simulator, they would be able to see the shape of the possible third wave graph, and assess the requirement for beds, oxygen, among others. “It is a simple, easy-to-use calculator,” he said. Panda stressed the need for each state to have possible future Covid wave graphs. “The second wave had a different disease progression in different states, underlining the heterogenous nature of the pandemic. Country-specific surges or case averages will not serve the purpose of states or districts. A model that can project future surges specific to a smaller, local geographical area is required,” said Panda. The timing of the second wave too differed from state to state, which is why local projection is important. “Once the district or state authorities are alerted about an upcoming surge, suitable micro-containment measures could be adopted, including prevention of spread of infection from a region, where the surge is expected, to other regions,” he said. The online tool will use data on various Covid parameters, such as transmission rate, symptomatic infection, relative infectiousness of asymptomatic versus symptomatic infection, vaccination status in population, per capita rate at which post-infection immunity wanes, mortality rate, among others. It will also use state variables and make projections based on the characteristics of the first and second wave. The model will depict state/district-specific shape and height of an upcoming wave, ICMR scientists told TOI. The model was recently used to predict the severity of the third wave in India. It is called CHROMIC--Collaborative Health Research On Modelling by ICMR and Imperial College model. Panda said the simulator is based on a deterministic, compartmental model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/icmr-tool-to-help-states-gear-up-for-3rd-wave/articleshow/85816286.cms||Neha Madaan

---||Lucknow||UP economy on fast track despite pandemic jolts||Over one and half years into the Covid-19 pandemic, UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has recognised that economic growth is a priority. With his “reform, perform, transform” mantra, he has shown that this is “an evolving Uttar Pradesh” we are witnessing. The state’s economy has improved markedly under him since 2017. Yogi has enacted a series of policies that have helped the economy improve. Employment opportunities have improved, unemployment rate has fallen and wages eventually increased. What makes this economic record especially remarkable is that the economy faced major headwinds, particularly due to slowdown of economic activities globally due to the pandemic. Despite that, Uttar Pradesh has received 96 proposals for investment of Rs 66,000 crore since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. American tech giants like Microsoft, MAQ Software and PepsiCo are setting up their units in Uttar Pradesh at a cost of Rs 2,866 crore. The state’s focus has been to improve law and order situation in the state. Yogi’s no tolerance approach has led to over 34k criminals being booked and Rs 1,500 crore mafia property seized since 2017. The Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) of Uttar Pradesh grew at a CAGR of around 8.43% between 2015-16 and 2020-21 to reach Rs. 17.06 trillion (US$ 234.96 billion). The Net State Domestic Product (NSDP) grew at a CAGR of around 8.42% between 2015-16 and 2020-21 to reach Rs. 15.12 trillion (US$ 208.34 billion). It is Yogi’s ambition of powering UP into a $1 trillion economy state behind organising one of India’s biggest ‘Investors Summit’ in 2018 which attracted 1045 intentions with investments worth INR 4.28 lakh Cr. Meanwhile, Uttar Pradesh has emerged as the top investment destination and has received 98 investment proposals worth Rs 13,408.19 crore in the manufacturing sector during the past four years. The state, ranked number 2 in the country for ‘Ease of Doing Business’ has become the hotspot for foreign investors as well. The government’s marquee initiative “One District One Product (ODOP)” Programme, launched on the occasion of UP Diwas in January, 2018 is playing a major role when it comes to revival of the traditional handicrafts and strengthening the rural economy. The objective of the programme is to preserve, develop and promote local arts, crafts and traditional skill of communities spread across each district of Uttar Pradesh. For example, the artisans’ of the old wood carving industry of Saharanpur needed training to attune them to present-day requirements. Now under the ODOP scheme, they are being provided with training facilities which will not only improve the products, but will also improve efficacy. Already over 90 lakh Micro Medium and Small Enterprises (MSMEs) of the state are playing a major role in boosting the state’s economy and are engaged in making unique products that are in demand within the country as well as in international markets. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath wanted to further strengthen the contribution of MSMEs and traditional artisans in UP’s GDP through the ODOP Programme and lead the state’s economy to achieve $ 1 trillion milestone. ODOP has further led to a 38% increase in the export sector of the state. The current unemployment rate in Uttar Pradesh stands at 5.0 % which is one of the lowest in the country as per the July 2021 report of Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE). Maharashtra has 10.7% unemployment rate while Kerala has 7.5% unemployment rate. Prior to 2017, unemployment was above 18% and with the arrival of Yogi Adityanath and his commitment towards ensuring employment, the figures drastically came down to 2.1% in 2017 and till 2020 remained well below 10%. Making the case that infrastructure itself can be inclusive is a straightforward one. Many of the worst decisions in the infrastructure planning of Uttar Pradesh were made decades ago to intentionally marginalise and separate communities but Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s primary policy is inclusiveness and welfare of 24 crore citizens of the state. As a result, Uttar Pradesh, earlier known for poor infrastructure, is now accelerating towards expressway success by building India’s longest expressway network (approx 1,321 kilometers network). Earlier this week, Yogi approved the proposal of BrahMos AeroSpace which had sought 200 acres of land in the Defence Corridor to establish a missile manufacturing unit in the state.

He claims the course is an attempt to distort history to serve “vested political and communal interests of a certain community”. Viswam, a CPI functionary, stated, “I write this letter to put forth my strong objection regarding the prejudiced and inaccurate nature of the material being included in a course by JNU as part of the newly introduced engineering programme. It is deeply unfortunate that higher education is being used as a platform to communalise and politicise geo-political issues through the presentation of half-truths and academically dishonest information.” He adds that the contents of the course make incredulous assertions pertaining to global terrorism and political regimes that have supported it. “The statements in this counterterrorism module include assertions such as ‘jihadi terrorism’ being the only form of ‘fundamentalist-religious terrorism’ and communist regimes of Soviet Union and China as the ‘predominant state-sponsors of terrorism’ that influenced ‘radical Islamic states’. These statements are not only historically inaccurate but also deeply prejudiced and politically motivated,” the letter added. As education minister, Pradhan must ensure that the centres of knowledge are not used for such malignant agenda, he said. “Given the divisive nature of content and serious ramifications of such inaccurate information, I appeal to you to immediately intervene in this matter and ensure that the university undertakes a comprehensive review of this course material,” the MP stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/new-course-at-jnu-an-attempt-to-distort-history/articleshow/85816301.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Ahmedabad||River polluters protected from top: Gujarat high court||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court was disturbed to learn that industrial effluents are illegally pumped in by industrial units into the city’s drainage lines. That results in the discharge of improperly treated water into the Sabarmati from Pirana’s sewage treatment plant (STP). The division bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice V D Nanavati on Tuesday ordered Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) to carry out a thorough inspection to detect effluent pipelines through which industrial waste is discharged into sewage lines. The court wants necessary action against all the errant industrial units. The judges also raised a question on who would monitor GPCB’s work. The court said its experience with GPCB is not very good. But the court said the board should rise to the expectations and assume a dominant role. The court said about the pollution caused by industrial units: “There are people at the top who protect these industries also. These are hard realities.” The court added: “Without their protection, would they dare to do this nuisance? These are the problems, unfortunately.” The court also told GPCB’s counsel, “If you decide to act sternly, strictly and take appropriate steps at the earliest, no person would dare to indulge in all this.” On causing pollution in the river, the court said: “We take pride in our river Sabarmati. We take pride in the riverfront, one of the biggest projects in the country over rivers.” The court went on to say: “…and we find the water so filthy, stinking, full of all these chemicals. Is there no other way out for discharging this water?” The judges called for putting an end to this problem “once and for all”. The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation explained to the court that DNP Infrastructure Pvt Ltd was the only bidder to operate the Pirana STP and the company had flagged quick corrosion in the plant due to industrial effluents that are illegally mixed in sewage. The court said that the owners of the industries do not have houses on the embankment of the river, which is full of foul stink. The court called for earnest participation from all concerned for the good of society and said that it would not spare anybody who is found erring. “The problem will be solved by catching hold of everybody by their ears. From this day, we will catch hold of everyone responsible for this by their ears,” the judges commented. They said that there have been enough directions to rectify the problems to reduce industrial pollution, but the question always arose about monitoring. As the HC has taken up this issue of river pollution suo motu, the judges asked the amicus curiae, Hemang Shah, to inspect the site and study the subject thoroughly. The amicus told the court that he would take assistance of an NGO, Paryavaran Suraksha Samiti, from Vadodara. He will submit a note by September 14.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/river-polluters-protected-from-top-hc/articleshow/85818444.cms||---

The farm groups said the Haryana CM and his ministers are choosing to ignore the anger and resolve of Haryana farmers at their own peril. They warned the political leaders of not to try to divide the farmers across the states and said farmers are united and will not succumb to such tactics. “The political class is worried over the cementing of bonds between farmers from adjoining states of Punjab and Haryana. The politicians wanted the divisions to remain vertical between them for the nefarious political designs, but they must keep it in mind that now as they have joined hands, nobody can divide them. As even the contentious SYL canal project and other bitter issues too have failed to divide them and Haryana politicians are using these failed tactics to create a wedge,” said BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) president Joginder Singh Ugrahan. BKU (Ekta Dakaunda) general secretary Jagmohan Singh said Haryana is trying to play mischief in which it will not succeed. The bonds between farmers from Haryana and Punjab are getting stronger than ever before and these tactics could not create differences. The farm groups also have taken a serious view of Khattar’s statement that it is the Punjab government which is behind the farmers’ protests and says this is one more insult to the farmers as the farmers don’t take any advice from any government. Meanwhile, the farmers say deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala is reported to be defending the brutal police action in a shameful manner in Karnal on August 28, though earlier he had spoken about action against the SDM. The farm groups and SKM reiterated that a case should be registered against Karnal SDM Ayush Sinha and all those involved in the assault on protesting farmers and their immediate dismissal. Haryana Police also needs to withdraw all cases filed against farmers, they said. The SKM has condemned the case filed at Ambala against Gurnam Singh Charuni and other farmers on Saturday, after they blocked highways in protest against the Karnal police brutality. The police brutality of the BJP-JJP government in Haryana is being condemned by spontaneous farmers’ protests not just in Haryana, Punjab and Uttarakhand but in various other states too, farm bodies said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/dont-try-to-split-farmers-cm-told/articleshow/85816316.cms||Neel Kamal

The road on the grabbed land was meant for reaching a godown constructed on another disputed land by Afsha-led construction company. Talking to TOI on Tuesday, ADG Varanasi zone Brij Bhushan said, “Nandganj police in Ghazipur lodged an FIR under Section 447 (criminal trespass) of IPC and 3/5 of Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984 against Afsha Ansari, her brothers Anwar Dhahjad and Sharjil Raja and others on Monday.” “The case pertains to grabbing land of a pond in Fatehullapur to construct a road illegally for accessing the godown,” he added. He said the FIR was lodged a day after removing illegal possession of Afsha Ansari’s company from the pond land and demolishing the illegally constructed road. Under the on-going drive against mafia dons, especially for hitting their economic empire, the Ghazipur administration and police had seized a plot of 4.1696 hectare worth Rs 22.13 crores owned by Afsha Ansari and her brothers in the name of a firm, Vikas Construction Company, in Fatehullapur area under Gangster Act. The action had taken place after the gangster court in Ghazipur district issued non-bailable warrants (NBWs) against the trio in September 2020, a week after they were booked under Gangster Act for their involvement in grabbing land, which had already been confiscated in past on district magistrate’s order in different cases of embezzlement and other criminal activities, said police. Ghazipur police said that this property in Fatehullapur was confiscated in November 2020 and many illegal constructions including main gate, rooms and tin sheds had also been demolished on the said plot by a joint team of district administration and police. Officials said that the firm, Vikas Construction Company, in which Afsha, her brothers and others including Ravi Narain Singh are partners, had given this property to FCI on rent to use for warehousing. The officials said, “Going through the land revenue records, it came to light that this property existed on a pond land. During the consolidation process in Fatehullapur village in 1970, some people had transferred 32 bighas of pond in the name of individuals, including one Ramdev. Later, Ramdev sold over five bigha land to Vikas Construction Company.” “As these facts came to light, the chief revenue officer rectified land revenue records by removing the name of Ramdev and returning the land to the gram sabha. On the report of the land revenue department, an FIR was also lodged with police against grabbing of pond land,” they added. The cost of the pond land where the illegal road was constructed for accessing the godown, was estimated as Rs 27 lakhs while the road was constructed with an investment of Rs 25 lakhs, the ADG said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/mukhtars-wife-in-laws-booked-for-illegal-road-on-grabbed-land/articleshow/85818450.cms||Rajeev Dikshit

MP Girish Bapat on Tuesday chaired a meeting of the Airport User Consultative Committee and reviewed the status of the parking facility and new terminal building projects. Pune airport director Santosh Dhoke told TOI that while they were trying their best to complete the car parking project soon, no plan was in motion to contact the PMC or private landowners for alternative land. “We can work on land that belongs only to the Airport Authority of India (AAI). As per the contract, the completion date of the car parking project is April 30 next year, but we are trying our best to complete the project early. Until the project is ready, parking issues will remain,” Dhoke said. As per a press release issued by Bapat’s office, the car parking project was 65% ready and the new terminal building was 61% ready. “The MP reviewed both projects and expressed satisfaction on the progress of work,” an airport official said. The director also rejected the plan wherein cars would be allowed to use the car parking facility that is ready. “That cannot happen as it will impact the progress of work on the site and it can also lead to a major accident. The car parking project can only be used once it is fully ready,” Dhoke added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/parking-issues-at-airport-to-continue/articleshow/85816368.cms||Joy Sengupta

It is the state’s prerogative to choose one officer from the list. Even when UPSC selects the three-member panel, the state chief secretary and the outgoing state DGP are part of the five-member UPSC committee. Bengal, while sending the list to UPSC, did not send the names of four senior IPS officers of Bengal cadre — Kuldeip Singh, SBS Tomar, Sanjay Chander and Zulfiquar Hasan — because they are now in central deputation. While Singh is now the DG CRPF, Tomar is a joint secretary in the cabinet secretariat. The state government had initiated the process of appointment of DGP in June. It had first proposed seven names of DG-ranked officers. The UPSC then asked for names of all ADGs with 30 years of job experience, Bengal government sent names of 17 IPS officers along with their biodata. A senior officer said: “Till Tuesday, the UPSC recommendations did not reach the state. The interim appointment will continue till the Centre-state consultative process is completed.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bengal-appoints-an-acting-dgp/articleshow/85813988.cms||Debashish Konar
---||Jaipur||Focus on health, hygiene at coaching centres in Rajasthan||JAIPUR: Coaching centres across the state are reopening from Wednesday, but the administrations of three districts–Kota, Jaipur and Sikar—are on their toes. The district administration in Kota has directed coaching centres to prepare a mandatory database of students enrolling them on a day-to-day basis to counter any untoward incident in the wake of a projected third wave. Also, prioritising vaccination of 18+ students at all healthcare centres has been ordered. Kirti Rathore, deputy commissioner of Kota Municipal Corporation, said that they have started sanitising the coaching areas and taking extra care of health and hygiene. “Stringent measures like penalising those not wearing masks in public areas and not following social distancing norms. It is being done to in the interest of students,” said Rathore, who has advised the coaching centres to keep the health workers at standby in every building to handle any emergency. Already, 30,000-40,000 students have arrived in Kota ensuring a grand opening of the first batch starting on September 1. The administration has advised the coaching centres to go slow in registering students for physical classes anticipating the possibility of the third wave. Kota sees a peak of about 1.5 lakh students in the age group of 14-21 enrolled for NEET and JEE at various levels. “Handling 1.5 lakh students in the next two months will depend on how covid will react,” said an administrative officer. Jaipur which is turning out to second big coaching hub in North India especially for NEET, JEE-Advanced/ Mains, civil services, chartered accountant/company secretary, bank PO etc has made elaborate arrangements to ensure that the coaching system has a smooth run. Considering the age group of 17-20 students coming to Jaipur, Antar Singh Nehra, a collector of Jaipur, has asked the coaching institutes to apply for vaccination camps. “If any coaching institute has a good number of students not vaccinated or become eligible for vaccination should contact our office for special drives,” said Nehra. Jaipur gets around 50,000 students from outside the state. The upcoming hub of coaching Sikar exclusively for defences services along with JEE has got students from the countryside. Officials say that rush of students is easily accommodatable considering that most of the coaching centres are located outside the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/focus-on-health-hygiene-at-coaching-centres-in-state/articleshow/85818449.cms||---

The slight decline in cases has come as a breather for health officials. According to P Aruna, deputy director of health services, the caseload has been plateauing since the Onam festival. “Strict measures, including on the district borders, and awareness drives have helped us keep in check the recent spike in the cases. The vigil should be continued,” she said. Extensive vaccination drives were conducted in the district for the past few days to inoculate maximum number of residents. The district is getting close to half-a-lakh vaccines daily. The district collector has also increased the number of round-the-clock vaccination camps to 15, thanks to the steady arrival of doses, from 10 earlier. On Tuesday, more than 13,000 doses of vaccines were allotted to the 15 centres. Meanwhile, 185 Covid patients were discharged from various treatment centres in the district on the day, bringing the active cases down to 2,028. While 2,36,077 people were tested positive for the virus in the district till date, 2,31,783 of them have recovered. The Covid-19 toll, however, shot up to 2,266 with the state including three more fatalities that occurred in the district in the media bulletin. In Tirupur district, 67 people were tested positive for the virus on the day, taking the case tally to 90,305, of which 88,607 have recovered. With 87 patients getting discharged, the active cases in Tirupur have dipped to 767. The district also recorded two Covid deaths, pushing the toll up to 931.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/at-173-coimbatore-logs-less-covid-cases-than-chennai/articleshow/85816356.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||Dengue, typhoid, SARI patients shown as Covid admissions at Kamptee SDH, GMCH||Nagpur: Though the Sub-district Hospital at Kamptee closed down its Dedicated Covid Health Centre (DCHC) over a month ago following dip in cases, the civil surgeon’s (CS) office has shown 15 patients under admission at the facility. Civil surgeon Dr Devendra Paturkar didn’t respond to TOI’s calls and messages. When TOI cross checked as only one has tested positive in the last 12 days in all 12 tehsils in the district, the officials said five dengue patients, two typhoid patients and 8 fever patients are presently under treatement at the SDH in Kamptee. Similarly, the civil surgeon’s office has shown 14 Covid admissions at GMCH and five at IGGMCH. GMCH officials said right now only three Covid patients were in admission at their DCH. “Eight severe respiratory acute infection (SARI) patients are also in the DCH. Three of them are on O2 support while five are on room air,” they said. At IGGMCH, only one Covid patient is admitted. As on August 30, the CS data shows 49 patients admitted in the district including the four who tested positive the same day. Of these, 15 were admitted at Kamptee SDH, one each at two private hospitals, five at AIIMS, six at IGGMCH and nine at GMCH. The data also showed 13 patients in home isolation. Two of them were in Nagpur Urban, which has stopped home isolation since August 25. Yet, all these figures add up to 54 and not 62, which is the official figure for under treatment. After TOI’s queries, the CS office removed the 15 patients shown at Kamptee SDH and seems to have adjusted them under home isolation as the figure under this shot up suddenly to 23 including 17 from Nagpur Urban area in Tuesday’s reporting. However, the CS probably failed to factor in the new guidelines while covering up the gaffe. Like Monday, the CS’s data for Tuesday also doesn’t give a fair idea of total admissions. The total admissions are shown as 43 including seven who tested positive the same day. With two patients recovered (minus) and seven new cases (plus), ideally the total must stand at 54 given that a day before 49 patients were in admission. Civic officials reaffirmed that the institutional quarantine norm was still in place and no asymptomatic patient was allowed home isolation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/dengue-typhoid-sari-patients-shown-as-covid-admissions-at-kamptee-sdh-gmch/articleshow/85816374.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Around 3,000 people residing in these two societies are now forced to wade through toxic chemicals and waste that has flooded their compound. Since 2017, Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation has been drilling and capping to flatten the garbage mountain at Pirana. Around five years ago, it built a wall to stop garbage from spilling into the two societies, where 28 victims of the 2002 massacre also stay. “Five days ago, the wall broke at several places, sending waste flying into some of the houses. The garbage has also blocked two internal roads, hampering movement,” said Nadeem Syed, a 2002 riot victim who stay in Citizen Nagar. Civil rights activist, Kaleem Siddiqui, filed a plea before Danilimda police seeking a complaint to be filed against errant AMC officials. Siddiqui said that a complaint of attempt to culpable homicide should be registered against the officials as their callousness is quite apparent in the dumping of chemical waste at the spot. He said many people are suffering due to the apathy of AMC officials who have done nothing despite being been directed by the high court to clear the garbage.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/garbage-load-wrecks-wall-floods-societies/articleshow/85818476.cms||Ashish Chauhan

---||Kolkata||Bikers’ safety, seat belts and jaywalking on police radar this Road Safety Week||Kolkata: This Road Safety Week, cops will be focusing on three issues — instilling traffic sense amongst two-wheeler riders, making motorists understand the importance of wearing seat belts and explaining to pedestrians the danger of jaywalking. The importance that the police brass was giving to two-wheelers became clear on the first day itself, when commissioner Soumen Mitra kicked off the week at Brooklyn on CGR Road — a Port area which has attained notoriety for frequent accidents involving two-wheelers. Mitra reiterated how the city was witnessing a steady drop in the number of accidents following the participatory and proactive role of the police in spreading awareness. Mitra spoke at length of a new initiative by Kolkata traffic police to provide counselling and rehabilitation help to families of fatal accident victims. The cops are meeting such victim families and helping them to get insurance claims at the earliest. “We have been successful in bringing down accidents. Our efforts are on to bring them down further. We will help accident victims get their insurance claims quickly. The OCs of local police stations will meet the families of these victims and help them expedite the process,” said Mitra. Across 25 traffic guards, innovation will be the key instead of the usual roadside awareness campaigns. The East traffic guard has taken the lead in innovating and is targeting the young. For a beginning, those not wearing helmets were asked to take a selfie at a selfie point that will have a huge cutout of a helmet above the rider’s head. Those found walking on the road talking on mobile were asked to complete an obstacle race, the obstacles being similar to the ones “faced in real life on the road when one is walking on the road without caring for the traffic around them”. Errant bikers were also asked to take up a lane-driving challenge and those successfully completing the course were handed a token prize. At Tiljala traffic guard, cops are getting motivational speaker Indrajyoti Haldar to speak on the benefits of following traffic rules. “We are targeting the affluent class as we have found several of them breaking rules at night. Before that, we got app cab drivers to manage traffic for us and see for themselves how even a simple stop line violation can lead to a potential traffic challenge,” explained an officer there. The southwest traffic guard has decided to teach two-wheeler riders and auto drivers on the black spots of drivers of goods vehicles. “Unless two-wheeler and three-wheeler riders know the problems faced by those driving bigger vehicles, they will fail to be careful. We are asking the bikers to get on trucks and then try to spot a bike overtaking from the left. We are also holding an orientation course for auto drivers,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/bikers-safety-seat-belts-and-jaywalking-on-police-radar-this-road-safety-week/articleshow/85814036.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: 50 colleges seek extra divs as more clear boards||Mumbai: The higher & technical education department has received around 50 applications from colleges across the state seeking additional divisions this year. The state government had extended a fast-track approval system for new divisions, as a one-time offer this year as more students cleared the HSC board in the pandemic year and there was an increase in demand. The department had issued a circular allowing colleges which are seeing higher demand for courses to increase divisions, if they have the infrastructure and faculty to sustain it. Initially, only three colleges showed interest. The numbers then increased to around 50. An official said that section 109 (8) of the Maharashtra Public Universities’ Act, 2016, allows the government to adopt a fast-track system to start new divisions in “extraordinary situations”. Since more students have cleared the boards, there was an increase in demand and therefore, considering it as an extraordinary situation, the department decided to approve applications after scrutiny and verification, said the official. The approval for these 50 applications is expected in a day or two. Autonomous colleges, however, can exercise their academic and administrative autonomy to increase their divisions in case of high demand, said a Mumbai University official. In Mumbai, St Xavier's College paved the way for autonomous colleges to take the leap, by increasing a division each for BMS and BMM. The college received a few thousands of applications for its 60 seats, prompting them to seek extra divisions. They got an approval letter from the government and the university during the weekend. Several colleges, however, have sought an up to 20% increase in their intake capacity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-50-colleges-seek-extra-divs-as-more-clear-boards/articleshow/85816417.cms||Yogita Rao

---||Pune||Pune NCC unit to get indoor firing range||Pune: The National Cadet Corps (NCC) Group headquarters in the city will soon have an indoor firing range on its campus on Senapati Bapat Road This is a step towards securing improved training infrastructure for the cadets and to ensure safe firing practice. As of now, the cadets practise firing in an open range on the campus. The need for an indoor firing range was felt after a February 2013 accident in which a 14-year-old cadet received a bullet injury in the head during practice and slipped into a coma. The cadet remained in coma for three years before succumbing to the injury in 2016. Group Commander Brigadier Suneel Limaye, who pursued the matter with the state government, told TOI on Monday, “Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has agreed in principle to sanction Rs 5.5 crore to set up the new range here.” The range will have eight lanes with the latest equipment for practice. “Right now, we have to take cadets to the Balewadi shooting range for advanced practice,” said Limaye. Around 17,000 NCC cadets from Pune and Solapur districts get trained in junior and senior divisions under Pune group. A significant number of cadets pursue shooting as a sport. “In fact, some cadets like Shruti Bawasar and Gajanan Khandagale have represented NCC in national shooting competitions in the recent past. Khandagale has been performing well in state and national competitions,” Limaye added. A group of experienced Junior Commissioned Officers, mostly from the infantry regiments, are instructors at the group. They train cadets right from handling weapons to shooting during the training, said NCC officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pune-ncc-unit-to-get-indoor-firing-range/articleshow/85816395.cms||Sandip Dighe

More than 85,000 tonnes of legacy waste lies on the Sabarmati riverbanks in Gandhinagar. Every monsoon, leachates from the site along with garbage, including plastics, metals and domestic waste, flows into the river. Each day, Gandhinagar residents together generate 110 metric tonnes of garbage. A visit to the site will reveal the truth. While the Gandhinagar Municipal Corporation has commissioned three trammel machines at the dump site on the river bank to process and segregate waste 300 tonnes of waste per day, barely 500m behind the Gandhinagar crematorium, Antim Dham, a new dumpsite along the river is fast emerging. Here, too, GMC garbage trucks can be seen rolling in and emptying their contents. Despite this pollution along the riverbank, Gandhinagar ranked 22 in the Swachh Bharat Sarvekshan and was rated 3-star garbage-free city in May 2020. “These days because of the tiff between the GMC and several societies in Gandhinagar over waste segregation, we receive only 34 tonnes instead of 110 tonnes every day. We need more trammel machines to prevent a Pirana from happening in the state capital,” says a senior GMC official. The official also admitted that the three machines do not operate every day. “The dump is right on the Sabarmati riverbed behind Sector 30 crematorium. When it rains heavily, the garbage flows directly into the river,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/capital-punishment-for-the-sabarmati/articleshow/85818473.cms||Soumitra Trivedi

It is the Ganeshnagar pile, which is now already 15 feet high. This site lies between a Torrent sub-station and the AMC’s sewage hygienization plant. Sources said that the site became an active dumping ground from 2017. Ganeshnagar residents said that AMC trucks roll in each day and empty hundreds of tonnes of household garbage. Of late, residents have begun noticing garbage mixed with dry sludge which releases toxic fumes. On June 22, 2018, Salmabano Ansari, a 52-year-old resident of Ganeshnagar, had died of severe burns after falling on a sand dump nearby. Her husband Nizamuddin Ansari who was with her is yet to recover from those burns. He told TOI: “There is no processing of garbage at the Ganeshnagar site and the mound is rising rapidly.” He added: “We see trucks emptying garbage at this place every day.” Nizamuddin lives about a kilometre from the site. While there are 58 bio-mining trommel machines at the Pirana dump site, there are none at the Ganeshnagar site. At Pirana, eight of the machines process 1,000 tonnes of waste a day while the remaining 50 process 300 tonnes a day. The AMC’s solid waste department had recently boasted about clearing 25 acres at the Pirana dump site through bio-mining. Meanwhile, the Ganeshnagar heap is affecting people of the nearby Citizen Nagar and Gulmohar Society. As for Pirana, an AMC official said that the machines are segregating and processing 13,000-14,000 tonnes of mixed garbage per day. “We will be able to flatten all the three mountains within the next two-and-a-half to three years,” he said. He stated that about 5,000 tonnes of garbage is added every day. The Pirana dump is spread over 80 acres with three 55-metre mounds sitting on approximately 40 acres of land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/ganeshnagar-pile-reaches-for-toxic-pirana-height/articleshow/85818468.cms||Soumitra Trivedi
---||Chandigarh||In Jind, farmers protest for FIR against SDM, CM over lathicharge||Jind: Seeking an FIR against Karnal SDM Ayush Sinha and Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar for use of force on agitating farmers on August 28, farmers took out a massive protest here on Tuesday. They submitted their memorandum to the DC, quoting the governor to seek strong action by September 6 else be ready to face the ire of peasants. Farmers, including women, started their protest from ‘Rani Talab’ and ended at mini-secretariat in 2km stretch. Farmers lashed out at Khattar for playing politics by saying that Haryana farmers were not involved in the protest and defending Karnal SDM Ayush Sinha. The one who got serious injuries are from Haryana only and are backing their Punjab counterparts strongly and will continue till last, said farm activists. Farmers will soon plan to gherao Khattar’s residence to show him that farmers from Haryana too are standing firmly with farmers from Punjab and othe parts of the country, if demands of registering FIR against SDM and other officers concerned by September 6 were not met. Capt Bhupender Jaglan (retd), one of the protesters said Haryana and Punjab farmers were united from Day 1, but the BJP had been trying to split them up and the same policy was being adopted by Khattar and deputy CM Dushyant Chautala. “We had banned the entry of the Chautala family for 17 years after Kandela kand which happened in 2001-02 in which nine farmers were killed in Jind as Om Prakash Chautala was the then CM in the INLD government. Thereafter, Dushyant had offered to apologise in Jind bypoll in 2019 after coming in Kandela village’s chabutra for the act done by his grandfather. Now, our village may take such a step this time too to impose a ban on Dushyant’s family,” said Ramphal Kandela and Chajju Ram Kandela, who were involved in the protest on Tuesday and had been playing a main role during the Kandela incident too.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/in-jind-farmers-protest-for-fir-against-sdm-cm-over-lathicharge/articleshow/85816384.cms||---

The shops which used to be packed with students and parents on such days lacked the usual excitement on Tuesday. While the sales picked up after the state government announced that schools and colleges would be reopened on September 1, it was less than usual, the shopkeepers said. They ascertained the poor sales to lack of money flow and possibility of closing of educational institutions if the new cases increase again. Mohamed Shafeeq, 40, of Modern Bags, said there wasn’t any rush among people to purchase bags. “There was some business during February this year when schools and colleges reopened after the first wave. However, institutions were closed again in April because of the second wave. Most of them would have not used the bags purchased then.” Another bag seller, P Ibrahim, of Lucky Bag, said though the cost of bags has come down by 10-15%, there was not much demand for bags in the past few days. It is mostly the middle and lower middle income groups that come for shopping to Five Corner, but they are hit hard by the pandemic, he said. Jaya Kumar, owner of Suguna Nilayam, a popular stationery shop in the junction, said the sales remain low since the shops were reopened six weeks ago. “Before school starts, students would get separate notebooks for each subject, buy cover to wrap them and paste name stickers over them. However, this time, there was no such compulsion to do so.” While there was a steady stream of sale of pens and papers used during online classes when schools were closed, we have to wait and see how things turn up in coming days for sales of notebooks and other items to pick up, said S Vimala, owner of another stationary shop.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/stationery-shops-report-poor-sales-before-school-reopening/articleshow/85816402.cms||Sampath Kumar

In a move initiated by the Mihan-SEZ development commissioner Sraman Vasireddy, both the ministers will be holding discussions with the unit-holders in Mihan-SEZ. The ministers would be given feedback on future plans, employment projections and also the problems faced by industries here, said Vasireddy. Issues like boundary wall and customs facilities will also be discussed, he said. Even before being elected as an MP, Gadkari had been promoting Mihan, which he terms to be one of the biggest job-creating projects for the region. Raut too, as a guardian minister, has been taking interest in the project. In another development, a meeting was held at the Vidarbha Industries Association (VIA) to discuss the issue of delay payment charges levied on some of the industries which have been allotted land in the SEZ. The development commissioner was also present in the meet. “There are around 12 units that have been allotted land and have made initial payment. However, now as the units plan to start operations, Maharashtra Airport Development Company (MADC) has demanded additional charges on account of delay in clearing the dues,” said Suresh Rathi of the VIA. These are mainly small units having land ranging from one to three acre. The delay was mainly due to Covid hitting the cash flow, said sources. This was the second meeting on the issue. A proposal will be put up before the MADC that these firms should be allotted the land by allowing relaxation in additional charges payable due to the delay, he said.

With a cumulative grade point average (CGPA) of 3.65, MU became the best-rated public university in the state so far. In the new format, Kolhapur’s Shivaji University recently bagged A++ rating with 3.52 CGPA. Savitribai Phule Pune University has an A+ grade, but was assessed in 2017 in the old format. MU improved its NAAC rating from 3.05 CGPA and an ‘A’ grade awarded in 2012 in the old format, which expired in 2017. The application process got delayed by three years, but the university submitted the self-study report (SSR) in 2020. The NAAC peer team visit was scheduled on August 24-26. The university was assessed from the 2014-19 period and the new rating will be valid for seven years. Among the parameters, the university performed very well in curricular aspects, infrastructure and in institutional values and best practices, said MU’s pro-vice-chancellor Ravindra Kulkarni. This was followed by student support, teaching-learning and evaluation and research and governance. University’s green initiatives, skill-based education, and heritage conservation were appreciated by the peer team. Overall, the CGPA score was based 70% on quantitative parameters through data validation and verification process and 30% on qualitative parameters’ evaluation by the peer team. Many state and central agencies’ funding are linked to NAAC accreditation. A++ will help the university compete for institute of eminence status, said Kulkarni. It will help the university build its image among stakeholders, from prospective students to employers, and among international students, who would want to choose their destination for higher studies, he added. “The rating will enable Institute of Distance and Open Learning to offer online programmes and increase enrolment too,” he said. MU VC Suhas Pednekar said it was a matter of great pride to get the highest rating. Higher & technical education minister Uday Samant congratulated and thanked university officials and its administration for the high rating and to prove itself once again. Rajan Welukar, former MU VC, during whose tenure the varsity got its last accreditation, said the varsity has seen many developments in 2014-19, from infrastructure to research, which was reflected in ratings. Now, assessment was more objective, he said. As it bagged the highest rating in 2017, Pune University’s rating is valid for seven years, till 2024, said its pro-vice-chancellor N S Umarani.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-four-years-after-mus-naac-rating-expired-it-gets-a/articleshow/85816459.cms||Yogita Rao
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: 23 buildings to come up at East-West Metro tunnel subsidence site||KOLKATA: Twenty-three structures will come up in the open space in Bowbazar where buildings had collapsed exactly two years ago after a tunnel-boring machine punctured an aquifer while constructing the East-West Metro tunnel. Around 700 residents were evacuated. The defunct TBM, Chundi, is still lying below Durga Pituri Lane off Bowbazar. Its twin, Urvi, completed the unfinished tunnel by digging till Sealdah station. From there, it took a U-turn to return to Bowbazar. “By November, we should be able to lift the two giant machines through the retrieval shaft at Durga Pituri Lane,” said N C Karmali, director (projects), Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation (KMRC), the implementing agency of the corridor. Around the same time, KMRC hopes to start building the houses, replacing the ones that had collapsed. “That is a heartening news. We can’t wait to go back to our old para,” said Sudipta Seal, one of the displaced residents who now lives in a flat rented by ITD-ITD Cementation, entrusted to build the twin tunnels covering 2.45km from Esplanade till Sealdah. The houses, to be constructed in the open space ringed by BB Ganguly Street in the north, Durga Pituri Lane in east, Gour De Lane in west and Hidaram Banerjee Lane in south, will look somewhat like the ones that fell. The new ones will be built in a modern way with much thinner walls. As per current KMC rules, there will be space between the structures. The old ones were dilapidated and more than 120-year-old. There was no space between the structures. “We shall ensure that every resident returns to the same floor area they occupied before August 31, 2019,” said an engineer. “We have come a long way since that fateful night when around 700 people had to be shifted to various hotels, some subsequently taken rented places while others returned to their homes after 40-odd buildings were restored. We are now looking forward to having all the 72 families back in 23 houses that will be built once the TBMs are retrieved,” said Somendranath Sengupta, ITD’s senior AGM (admin), who has led the team resettling the displaced residents.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/23-buildings-to-come-up-at-e-w-subsidence-site/articleshow/85814067.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty
---||Hyderabad||Telangana to raise water issue at boards’ meet||HYDERABAD: One-and-a-half months after the ministry of Jal Shakti issued a gazette notification on jurisdictions of both Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) and Godavari River Management Board (GRMB), the Telangana government said certain issues in the notification need clarification since they were contradicting with AP Reorganisation Act, 2014. The Telangana government is gearing up to raise the issues especially ongoing project issues and water sharing during the board meetings on Wednesday. Both Krishna and Godavari boards have called for preparatory meetings for handing over all the projects and implementation of gazette notification, which comes into effect from October 14. The Centre had issued the gazette notification on jurisdiction of Krishna and Godavari Boards on July 15. Official sources said as per the notification, “financial liability of any contract before the date of commencement of this notification, liability arising out of any of the present and future cases filed in the Supreme Court, high court, any other court or tribunal in regard to the projects or components specified in schedule 2 shall be the responsibility of the respective state governments.” The Centre also asked to stop all the ongoing works of unapproved projects immediately. According to officials among the 107 major and medium irrigation projects in both Telangana and AP, about 30 projects are ongoing and in various stages. “If the boards want to take over all the projects on the Krishna and Godavari, they have to take the financial responsibility of the ongoing projects also. If ongoing projects works are stopped, it will be a burden on the state government to pay the interests to banks and financial institutions without getting any benefit of the projects. Who will repay the loans to the banks? There is a chance of contractors of the projects seeking compensation from the state governments for delay in executing the projects,” a senior official of the irrigation department said. According to Reorganisation Act, new projects are those which were taken up after bifurcation of the state in 2014. “But the notification listed all projects, which were taken up in united AP as new projects and unapproved,” a chief engineer said. There are no combined projects and controversial projects constructed or taken up on Godavari river by the Telangana government, but they have been also brought under GRMB notification, he pointed out. CM KCR has been stressing for allocation in the ratio of 50:50 for both the states in the Krishna water till the final allocations are made. The officials argue when there is no final allocation yet, what will the KRMB do at this juncture. The government says the Centre should allocate funds to both the boards instead of asking the states to deposit Rs 200 crore. “The Telangana government has been asking national status for Kaleshwaram project, which is not being considered. Moreover, it is putting financial burden on the state to allocate funds for the board,” a top official of irrigation department said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-to-raise-water-issue-at-boards-meet/articleshow/85816437.cms||Koride Mahesh
---||Nagpur||Quietly, patients accept institutional quarantine||Nagpur: In a sharp contrast to the scene till a couple of months ago, the MLA Hostel wore a deserted look on Monday. The only noticeable activity during the day time is of the ongoing renovation work in some parts of the buildings. Till early June, the facility witnessed a mad rush of ambulances, anxious relatives and patients constantly moving in and out of wing II. Last week, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) restarted the Covid Care Centre (CCC) which was shut down and handed back to the state Public Works Department (PWD) due to a drastic fall in cases. Amid renewed concerns of a possible third wave and emergence of Delta variants, the civic body decided to discontinue home isolation of asymptomatic patients and place them in institutional quarantine at the MLA Hostel CCC. As the prevalence of Covid remains low, the civic body’s zonal teams are finding it difficult to convince new patients and their relatives about the necessity to go in for compulsory institutional quarantine. Unlike hundreds of patients being managed by large medical teams, a nodal officer and two paramedics are taking care of the nine patients admitted here since August 25. Nodal officer Dr Varsha Deosthale said patients are being treated with due care. “Some do exhibit anxiety after coming here but they accept the fact that they would have to stay here for at least 10 days,” she said. As enough rooms are available, each patient is occupying a single room on the fourth floor. The PWD had started renovation work, making other blocks unavailable right now. Though the NMC is providing timely meals and snacks, relatives are allowed to bring food from home. Dr Deosthale said patients would be tested on the 10th day from the day of their first Covid report and only those testing negative would be allowed to go for another brief phase of home isolation. The administration is not taking any chances, especially after February-March when case suddenly began to shoot up. Samples of these patients are also being sent for genomic sequencing to understand if there are any mutations taking place. Civic officials said while the patients are shifted in their ambulances to MLA Hostel, their high-risk close contacts are also being tested immediately. “Most of them have tested negative so far,” they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/quietly-patients-accept-institutional-quarantine/articleshow/85816495.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

The MTP law says that where any pregnancy is alleged by the pregnant woman to have been caused by rape, the anguish caused by pregnancy shall be presumed to constitute a grave injury to the mental health of the pregnant woman. “Under section 3(2)(b)(i), we find that if continuance of the pregnancy would involve a risk to the life of the pregnant woman or of grave injury to her physical or mental health, it can be terminated by a registered medical practitioner,’’ said an HC bench of Justices Ujjal Bhuyan and Madhav Jamdar on August 31. Given that she is a minor and keeping her mental state in mind the HC directed the District Legal Services Authority to depute a paralegal volunteer to aid and assist her. The National Legal Services Authority has a ‘para-legal volunteers’ scheme to train volunteers. She approached the HC through her father as her pregnancy had exceeded the 20-week legal bar on termination, requiring permission from the HC. While the law was recently amended to enhance the MTP bar 24 weeks’ gestation, it was not notified yet, a Central government counsel had informed the HC recently.

---||Kolkata||Big construction units to have recycle plants, KMC to crush debris from smaller projects||Kolkata: Construction projects that daily generate waste of 20 tonne or more will have to set up a recycling plant where the waste will be converted into aggregates for other construction activities. The Bengal chapter of Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India, the umbrella body of developers in Kolkata, has welcomed the proposal and agreed to implement it. “Construction sites have to become environment-friendly and stop dumping waste. They have to set up a waste material recovery plant at the site and work towards zero net waste generation,” a KMC official said. Construction waste includes head break concrete blocks of pile caps and broken tiles that are not biodegradable. Instead of disposing, they can be used for paving of driveways. The civic body will continue to lift waste from smaller projects but this waste will not be dumped in landfills. Instead, KMC is setting up a crushing unit to convert the waste into aggregates that can be used as raw material in construction activity. KMC has taken a plot in Rajarhat to set up the construction waste recovery plant. It will have a capacity to handle around 500 tonnes of construction waste a day. The plant will crush the waste into aggregates that can then be mixed with concrete to pave roads. Around Rs 55 crore will be spent in the Rajarhat unit that will be handed over to a private firm to operate it for 10 years. A similar plant has also been planned in Garden Reach to facilitate waste recovery and reuse from construction sites in south and south-west Kolkata. “We had a desperate search for land to set up construction waste recovery plants. Finally, we zeroed in on two plots. We hope to initiate the construction process soon,” said a KMC solid waste management department official. Many building components and construction debris can be recycled. Concrete and rubble are often recycled into aggregate and concrete products. Wood can be recycled into engineered wood products. Metals like steel, copper and brass are also valuable resources to recycle. Credai Bengal chairman Nandu Belani welcomed the move. “This will substantially reduce the pressure on landfills and also help us recover wealth from waste. Such activities are already under way in Indore and we will be fully supportive of its adoption in Kolkata,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/big-construction-units-to-have-recycle-plants-kmc-to-crush-debris-from-smaller-projects/articleshow/85814097.cms||Saikat Ray

---||Jaipur||30-year-old man beaten to death over illicit affair in Jaipur||JAIPUR: A 30-year-old man was beaten to death following a scuffle with the husband and paramour of a woman at Muhana Mandi here on Monday night. The victim was identified as Mohaniya Dhakad, a resident of the Bharatpur district. Little is known about his family and employment history. A priest of a nearby temple had spotted Dhakad lying lifeless on a footpath outside a tea shack on Tuesday morning. His face was crushed with a blunt object, possibly a stone. Dhakad’s partner Basanti Devi was also found injured and drunk. Police were bewildered by the complicated love affairs that included Basanti’s husband Kanhaiya Lal, her partner Mukesh Kumar Sharma with whom she also had children, and her present paramour Dhakad with whom she had been recently been going out. Police said all of them had gathered alongside a footpath in Muhana Mandi. They consumed liquor after which Dhakad, Kanhaiya Lal and Sharma had a heated argument with one another. Police suspect either Sharma or Kanhaiya Lal killed Dhakad. Investigators suspect Sharma as the chief accused in the case because he had fled from the scene after the incident. SHO Lakhan Singh Khatana said Kanhaiya Lal was detained for the interrogation and efforts were being made to arrest Sharma. Police said all four involved in the case are homeless and lived alongside roads in Muhana Mandi. They worked as labourers and consumed liquor on regular basis. “We suspect Sharma had used a stone and attacked Dhakad on the head. He then fled from the spot. We have found bloodstains on the footpath which has been cordoned off for the investigation,” said another official. Police added that Basanti’s condition is now stable and they were trying to corroborate who attacked her. “She has six kids and had been living alongside the road where she did odd jobs,” an official added. Investigators said they were trying to identtidfy Dhakad’s family members so that postmortem could be completed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/30-year-old-man-beaten-to-death-over-illicit-affair-in-city/articleshow/85818541.cms||---

SHO Sadar Nagaur, Anu Kumari, a constable posted in local intelligence unit Bhanwarlal Burdi, and SHO Aklera in Jhalwar, Nand Kishore Verma were suspended on the basis of their conversations. According to IG Ajmer Range S Sengathir, Burdi was suspended for his alleged collusion with Ganesh, an accused wanted in a drugs case. Anu Kumari was first sent to the line and then subsequently axed after a purported audio conversation of hers with Burdi came to light in which she is speaking about an alleged direction from a senior official to gun down Ganesh.Verma, who was earlier posted at the same police station in Nagaur, was shunted out because his audio recording with Burdi revealed that he was using foul language about Kumari.A senior police official said that Nagaur police had long suspected of a possible mole within their ranks who was helping Ganesh to evade arrests. When the accused was arrested on Tuesday, police found Burdi had a close relationship with Ganesh. He was axed the same day. “Soon after the arrest, an audio recording began to float on social media wherein Kumari was speaking to Burdi in which she was saying that a senior official had directed that the accused should be eliminated,” an official said, adding it was an irresponsible comment as no such directions were authorised. Meanwhile, a third audio clip of Burdi with Verma also came to notice. He was allegedly cajoling Burdi to speak to a circle officer (CO) and used uncouth language about Kumari. Police said that all audio recordings are being probed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/2-shos-constable-suspended-as-their-audio-clips-go-viral/articleshow/85818558.cms||---

To mark the beginning of this award, a function was hosted at ABLT hall of IIT-BHU in the presence of ACS (home), his family members and the institute authorities. The topper of BTech final year (metallurgy) will be given Rs one lakh as award, which was formally launched by minister of state (independent charge) for tourism and religious affairs Neelkanth Tiwari. “Last year I lost my father. As his ‘barsi (death anniversary) day was closing in, my family members including my mother Usha Awasthi, wife noted vocalist Malini Awasthi and brothers Manish and Ashish took a decision to institute an award in his name for the students who will contribute in nation-building and brighten the name of the institution and the country,” said ACS (home), while addressing the function. It was decided to institute this award at the same metallurgy department of IIT-BHU, where his father had taken admission in 1945, he said adding that then this department of IIT-BHU was known as College of Mining and Metallurgy of BHU. “Before passing out in 1949, my father had received special appreciation from the then principal of college Dr Swaroop Tatsamay,” he said recalling how after completing his special training in Germany for six years his father returned to India and served the Steel Authority of India apart from contributing in base casting of tanks and rail coaches. Mentioning his and his wife’s close association with Kashi, he said, “My father was deeply attached with Varanasi, which has witnessed outstanding development under the guidance of chief minister Yogi Adityanath after it became Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s constituency. In view of all these facts the family decided to introduce the award in father’s alma mater.” Gifting a check of Rs 14 lakh to the IIT-BHU director Prof PK Jain, the ACS (home) said, “Soon a cheque of Rs 6 lakh will also be given to the director for establishing a corpus fund for the endowment award,” said Awasthi adding that his family will also make announcement for encouraging girl students in engineering studies. Welcoming the initiative of the ACS (home) and his family, IIT-BHU director highlighted how alumni were benefiting the institute. Several members from the family of ACS (home), including Malini Awasthi and Ashish Awasthi, also addressed the gathering.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/acs-home-begins-award-at-iit-bhu-in-fathers-memory/articleshow/85818555.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Vax-for-office entry spurs printout rush in Chandigarh||CHANDIGARH: On the directions of UT adviser Dharam Pal, many departments, including Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB), UT estate office and UT secretariat building did not allow visitors to enter the offices without getting the first dose of Covid vaccination or RTPCR report of the last 72 hours. Many visitors, especially slum dwellers visiting the colony branch and rehabilitation branch, faced inconvenience and went to cyber cafes nearby to take printouts of Covid vaccination certificates. At UT estate office, assistant estate officer (AEO) Harjeet Singh Sandhu directed staff to ensure compliance with the UT adviser’s directions. He also set a format of how the staff would enter details of Covid vaccination or RTPCR report of visitors. This also led to several arguments between visitors who did not have the vaccination certificates or RTPCR reports and estate office staff, which did not allow them to enter. In one such case, Janak Raj, a senior citizen, said he wanted to go to the AEO office but did not have the vaccination certificate. The staff members took down details of his work and informed AEO Harjeet Singh Sandhu, who conveyed to him that his staff would do the needful. Similar scenes were witnessed at the CHB office in Sector 9. As per instructions issued by CHB CEO Yashpal Garg, the board’s staff only allowed people with vaccination certificates. Slum dwellers who had work related with slum rehabilitation schemes were seen arguing with security guards. A few applicants visited a computer shop nearby to take printouts of their vaccination certificates through Cowin portal. The staff also checked their Aadhar cards. In some cases, CEO staff was also cross-checking Covid vaccination certificates of visitors who had appointments in the CEO office. Board CEO Yashpal Garg said though it was the first day, staff members tried their best to ensure entry of only vaccinated applicants and staff. UT adviser Dharam Pal had issued stern directions in a bid to draw more people to vaccination centres and prevent a third wave. The health department was told to complete the second doses by December 15. The administration has claimed 100% first dose vaccination, a target the health department supposedly achieved before the August 15 deadline.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/ut-depts-stop-entrance-sans-vaccination-certificates/articleshow/85814122.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

He travels on the stretch four times a day, as he leaves for home for lunch, often cursing the speed breakers, which, he says, could cause accidents. The 46-year-old man says while half a dozen speed breakers are necessary to keep speeding vehicles in check, the remaining could have been avoided to offer a hassle-free travel for commuters. “I wonder who is giving permission to set up so many speed breakers and who requests for the same.” Residents of Krishna Colony also complain about the increasing number of unapproved speed breakers on the stretch connecting Krishna Colony and Fun Mall Junction on Avinashi Road via Link Road. G Senthil Kumar, a resident of Krishna Colony, says they are forced to take circuitous road to reach Fun Mall Junction to avoid the speed breakers. “I once counted up to 15 speed breakers and then lost count. There should be close to 20 speed breakers on the stretch and most of them are not required at all. It is high time officials reviewed speed breakers in residential areas and checked their purposes.” Consumer activist K Kathirmathiyon says speed breakers are built in gross violation of the Indian Road Congress rules. “I have sought data on the number of speed breakers in the city at the district road safety committee meetings, but it was not available with any departments.” According to him, speed breakers are built in the residential areas at the insistence of a few residents, who consider the presence of it in front of their house as some sort of status symbol. “Officials should be sensitized on the Indian Road Congress rules to make roads safer while laying them.” While the primary objective of a speed breaker is to bring down the road accidents by controlling vehicle speed on accident-prone stretches, commuters say there are instances when the speed breakers became dangerous and life threatening to the motorists. “The speed breakers that are not designed properly and lack black and white bands to give additional visual warning often cause accidents.” P Velmurugan, a resident of Pachapalayam, says in the absence of black and white bands they often come to know about the presence of speed breakers only after hitting them. “I had badly hurt my back many times because of this.” Kathirmathiyon, who is also a member of the district road safety committee, says speed breakers should have retro reflective painting in black and white. “It should be distinct from the pedestrian crossings with square designs. Instead, bar design painting is being done presently. Hence, commuters often fail to distinguish between a pedestrian crossing and a speed breaker.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/when-speed-breakers-pose-threat-to-motorists/articleshow/85816531.cms||V Devanathan
---||Delhi||Delhi: Law & order, probe bifurcation from today||NEW DELHI: From September 1, Delhi Police will begin full implementation of its project of bifurcating law and order from investigation, with a slew of changes being effected on the ground. The project, monitored by the Union ministry of home affairs, has been in operation on a pilot basis at 30 police stations for over three years. On August 8, TOI had reported about the police brass planning to expedite the separation process across Delhi. DCP (PRO) Chinmoy Biswal said an adequate number of policemen in the ranks of sub-inspectors, assistant sub-inspectors, head constables and constables have been notified as investigation officers (IO). “They have been selected after analysing human resource profiles of the existing staff of police stations. These IOs and their teams will probe and monitor trials of cases lodged at the police station concerned,” he added. Besides, there will be an “emergency crime team” at police stations 24x7 to register cases, collect evidence and conduct investigation consequent to calls on 112, attended by beat patrol vans. The investigation wing at a police station would be supervised by an officer termed as inspector (investigation) and the law and order wing would be headed by inspector (law & order). The SHO would be the overall head. The investigation wing staff would not be utilised in other duties without prior permission of the DCP. However, whenever extra force is required for any law and order situation, all hands would be on deck. The separation plan also involves assigning the control of PCR vans to police stations. This is being done to enhance the manpower and vehicular capabilities of the thanas to conduct beat patrolling and better surveillance on criminals and illegal activities, besides attending to law and order functions under the single command of the police station or district. Calls to 112 (earlier 100) would be handled by the central police control room as usual. “With this move, Delhi Police seeks to enter the next level of operational efficiency and hopes to serve citizens better by prompt response and vigil on crimes as well as availability of more personnel at police stations,” said Biswal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/law-order-probe-bifurcation-from-today/articleshow/85816504.cms||---
---||Pune||Pune: First Year Junior College second merit list to be declared on September 4||PUNE: The second merit list for admission to First Year Junior College (FYJC, Std XI) will be declared by the centralised admission process committee on Saturday. Students, who have not been allotted any college or have not confirmed their admission, can check the seat vacancy in all colleges on the website and change their preference forms accordingly for the second round. Medha Sinnarkar, principal of Laxmanrao Apte Prashala that had the highest cut-off marks in the science stream (485) in the first round, said over 3/4th of the seats were already filled up and the rest would be filled up in the second round. “In science stream, we have very few seats left, while in commerce, we still have a few seats. But I am sure all will be filled up in the second round. As for quota admissions, I do not think we would need to surrender the remaining seats as we are sure that the remaining seats will be filled up in the next round,” said Sinnarkar. Madhuri Chittewan, principal, Dr Kalmadi Shamarao Junior College, spoke about the confusion among parents and colleges due to the parallel occurrence of in-house quota and CAP round. “Till last year, there used to be a zero round before the actual CAP began. Students would take admission in various quotas during this time. However, that did not happen this time and both admissions are happening parallelly. Hence, students who have got admission in the quota round realised that they have got admission via the regular CAP and then cancelled their admission. All this is adding to the confusion,” said Chittewan. For students who have been allotted their first preference, it is compulsory to take admission. If they fail to do so, they will be blocked for further regular rounds and will be considered during special rounds only.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/fyjc-second-merit-list-to-be-declared-on-september-4/articleshow/85816533.cms||Ardhra Nair

A delegation, headed by AICC general secretary and Haryana in charge Vivek Bansal, met the full bench of NHRC, while leader of opposition in Haryana assembly Bhupinder Hooda led party MLAs in calling on the governor, seeking a judicial probe into the incident.They also urged the governor to return the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement (Haryana Amendment) Bill, 2021, for reconsideration to the state legislative assembly, instead of signing it. “This land acquisition Bill is anti-farmer, anti-poor and undemocratic. It was passed hurriedly without detailed discussion in the House,” Hooda alleged.  Hooda claimed the new Bill was against the intention and spirit of the central principal Act of 2013 and would hurt the interest and sentiments of farmers who were already agitating against the three agriculture marketing laws for the past nine months. He alleged that provisions that safeguarded the interests of farmers had been taken away. “All provisions of the old land acquisition law, such as the consent of farmers, the procedure for notice of Section-4 and Section-6, and giving residential plots with compensation in lieu of land, have been abolished in the new Bill,” Hooda alleged. In Delhi, Bansal was accompanied by Haryana Congress president Selja, MP Deepender Singh Hooda, former Haryana CLP leader Kiran Choudhry, former minister Captain Ajay Singh Yadav, national secretaries Virendra Rathore and Ashish Dua and Haryana general secretary Ajay Chaudhary. Bansal said Prime Minister Narendra Modi was giving the slogan of ‘atamanirbhar’, but the government was canecharging farmers who had actually made the country self-reliant.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/cong-approaches-nhrc-hry-guv/articleshow/85816539.cms||---
---||Jaipur||ASI yet to place revised plaque at Haldighati||Jaipur: The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) is yet to place a revised plaque at the Haldighati in Rajsamand declaring that the battle in 1578 was won by Maharana Pratap.An earlier plaque declaring that Pratap’s forces retreated from Haldighati was removed by the ASI on July 16 following objection from the Rajput organizations. Sources said the content of the revised plaque sent by the ASI Jodhpur circle has raised a debate among ASI officials causing the delay.Then, Rajsamand MP Diya Kumari, MLA Rajsamand Dipti Maheshwari had announced replacing the new plaque with a ‘correct’ version of history in days in July this year. Both of them had met with the then culture minister Prahlad Singh Patel for acting on an urgent basis. Thereafter, the new minister of state for culture directed the state tourism department to remove with immediate effect in the second week of July.The Jodhpur circle of ASI had sent the content for the plaque on the basis of suggestions they had received from the historian Chandra Shekhar Sharma. The circle expected to get the nod from the officials in Delhi within days but almost 50 days have passed with no call on the content.“The local office is still waiting to hear from the headquarter in Delhi on the plaque content sent to them,” Bipin Chandra Negi, superintendent, ASI circle Jodhpur. The content for the plaque has a common beginning but has two-three different endings or conclusions. “One end says that Pratap won the battle, the other says the battle was inconclusive while the third didn’t say anything on the outcome of the battle,” said the source.The ASI plaques are the official stand of the government based on solid research and historical facts so that they cannot be challenged by anyone.Sharma said that plaque was removed on the premise that information it contained that ‘Pratap forces retreated’ was baseless. “I don’t see why the government agency is taking too long to decide on the content. Those people who batted for the change are running short of patience. I hope the BJP government would examine the facts and will replace the chance soon,” said Sharma. The battle between Pratap and military commander of emperor Akbar, Man Singh of Jaipur lasted for a day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/asi-yet-to-place-revised-plaque-at-haldighati/articleshow/85818561.cms||---

The inspections will be done through ‘monitoring app for seamless inspections – (MASI) child care institutions (CCIs).“For last few months, due to the pandemic, no inspections were being done but now we have been informed that MASI is functional again so we will instruct the officials to go to the children shelters and find out about the living conditions of the minors residing there in all the districts”, said an official of the state child commission.The app shall be GIS enabled and will allow the official to conduct the inspection only on arriving at the CCI. The app shall ensure that random inspections are conducted by randomly selecting CCIs for inspections for child welfare committee member, district inspection committee and State Commission for Protection of Child Rights member. The app is unique as it shall include features for uploading of focus group discussion with children and photos and videos of CCIs.According to the list prepared by the commission, there are 172 children shelters currently operational in Rajasthan.In March, 27 boys were rescued after the commission received a complaint about the unrecognised shelter in Chomu and officials found that the boys were kept in unsuitable conditions. The boys hailed from North-east and this rescue triggered the child panel to take stock of the shelters being run though as yet there is no data about the unrecognised children institutions which are active in Rajasthan. Officials claimed that action will be taken against the unregistered shelters as and when they receive information regarding the same.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/panel-to-inspect-150-shelters-for-children-soon-across-raj/articleshow/85818568.cms||---

Parents with work schedules are doubly hard-pressed for time and thus stretched. Anita Jangid, an IT professional, said her son who is in Std III attends online classes from 8.40am till 2pm, which were his regular school hours. “The sports and music periods do not interest him when done online and we don’t force him to attend. As for the subjects, it is a task more for parents than the children. They are used to the system and can easily mute themselves or switch off the video. The attention span is very less and even if a student changes the background of his or her screen, the entire class gets distracted and it takes both the teacher and the parent to bring the class to order. There are parents who put a lot of pressure on children and make them attend everything which is stressful, but we do not want to stress our son,” she said. Jangid said young parents are also full of doubts. “Everything is new for us. We need to find the right balance between monitoring the child, making him study and letting him do what he wants to do. Counsellors are an option but not every family can afford or wants to visit a counsello. Hence, it is chaotic and we are just hoping that what we are doing is right for our child,” she added. Another parent said in a 40-50 minute class, the student is attentive only for the first 10-15 minutes. “It is the parents who take down notes. Then there are class tests and MCQs for which the child needs to be prepared which is done by us. Homework, worksheets and assignments need to be submitted. From morning till night, parents are engaged in either one thing or the other related to online classes apart from their regular office work and housework. The stress on parents of this age group is enormous,” the parent added. Another parent Leena Dulbake said the school tells the parents to physically drop off the worksheets and answer sheets during exams.  “During examinations, the children are not expected to go to the washroom. And if they do and it takes longer time, parents are questioned. Apart from students, it feels like parents are also under the scanner to perform well.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/parents-of-pupils-in-primary-classes-jump-through-hoops/articleshow/85816530.cms||Ardhra Nair
---||Coimbatore||Health of commuters, vehicles at risk: Experts||Coimbatore: Frequent travelling on the stretches that are dotted with speed breakers could cause harm to the body as well as vehicles, caution experts. Ortho specialists say those with back pain would develop more pain if they regularly travel on the stretches filled with speed breakers. Although there is a rule to have ramps on both sides of the speed breakers, they say the same is not being followed, leaving more pressure on the body of commuters while negotiating the bumps. According to them, there are instances of people suffering minor fractures to the spinal cord region while hitting the speed breakers. David V Rajan, director of Ortho-One Orthopaedic Speciality Centre in the city, says those with back pain should be more careful while dealing with speed breakers, as there is a chance for the pain to spread up to the legs as well. “Recently, a patient came in with back pain after hitting a speed breaker. When checked, there was a minor fracture to the spinal cord bone. Those with back pain should avoid sitting on the rear seats while traveling in buses and vans, as the impact will be more there. While travelling on two-wheelers, they have to be extra cautious.” Pointing out that a normal tyre would last three to five years and a shock absorber for five to seven years in normal conditions, N Selvaraj, a mechanic from Ramanathapuram, says their lifespan might get shorter if the vehicle is used on pothole-filled roads or those dotted with speed breakers. “Two-wheeler riders who travel on stretches filled with speed breakers regularly should get their vehicles serviced once in two to three months. Otherwise, it might take a toll on them,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/health-of-commuters-vehicles-at-risk-experts/articleshow/85816566.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

A committee, set up by the SPPU vice-chancellor Nitin Karmalkar to frame guidelines for autonomous colleges, has submitted its report and the rules would be implemented from the next academic year. The autonomous colleges will have to decide the curriculum of their courses beforehand. The SPPU has notified that the colleges will have to submit details about new courses and their proposal for autonomy to the SPPU before September 30. Karmalkar said that according to the recommendations, no new college will be able to start any undergraduate or postgraduate course without taking permission from the university. In Pune, many colleges have either applied for autonomy or have been granted autonomy status and the number is increasing every year. The university officials said that in the coming years, more colleges would be granted the status and hence it was necessary to form guidelines with respect to the courses offered by them. “Considering their problems and issues, we have framed the guidelines so that there is a balance and the process is properly streamlined,” added Karmalkar. Meanwhile, four years after its NAAC (National Accredita tion and Assessment Council) rating expired, Mumbai Uni versity got accredited with A++ on Tuesday. With a cumu lative grade point average (CGPA) of 3.65, MU became the best-rated public university in the state so far.

The proposed plan envisages major infrastructure projects and increased economic activities across the region. Sources said Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri, who chaired the meeting, flagged how delay in finalising the Regional Plan won’t be acceptable this time while highlighting how some years were lost when the last Regional Plan for 2021 was prepared. TOI has learnt that only Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar was present in the virtual meeting while all the three other states were represented by their ministers. Sources said Khattar flagged his concern over how large share of the state’s territory has come under the jurisdiction of NCR. Officials said no other major issue barring the Draft Regional Plan was taken up in the meeting. In an official release, the housing and urban affairs ministry said Puri urged the NCR participating states to adopt and implement the recommendations of the NCRPB’s plans and make use of its funding window available at very attractive rates, which will help in achieving accelerated growth and development of all sectors in in the region.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/states-seek-time-before-putting-plan-in-public-domain/articleshow/85816567.cms||Dipak K Dash

Jaipur Met office said the ongoing spell will continue for the next three days in the state with widespread rainfall activity expected. Two men push a car that got stuck in a waterlogged road in Sikar on TuesdayBari (Dholpur) received 80mm rains, the highest in the state, weathermen said. Attributing the revival of monsoon to active northerly winds and higher humidity levels, Jaipur Met office said monsoon would be active for the next couple of days. “Southwest monsoon will be active at least for the next three days when several places in Udaipur and Kota divisions are likely to get light to heavy showers. The best part is that monsoon activity is going to be really widespread in the state,” said an officer with Jaipur Met office. People in Jaipur also witnessed drizzles in scattered form which continued for the whole day. Drizzling guided the mercury to take a dip and made the weather pleasant. As the monsoon is in the last leg, people are hopeful that it is going to get the state out of the deficit status. “More than 15 districts are still in the category of deficit rainfall while majority of the reservoirs are yet to attain 90 per cent or above water levels. As monsoon season continues in the state till September 15, there is a possibility heavy rainfall in many parts might, which might fetch us more than 500mm of rainfall, which was the average monsoon last year,” said an officer with Jaipur Met office. On Tuesday, many places witnessed a rainfall varying from 10 mm to 80 mm. “Monsoon activity will increase in the state from Wednesday onwards,” the Met office said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/monsoon-in-last-lap-15-dists-still-rain-deficit/articleshow/85818581.cms||---

---||Chandigarh||Autoimmune diseases may hinder vaccine protection: Study||Chandigarh: Even as scientists have given the nod for vaccination of all groups of people against Covid, a group of patients suffering from an autoimmune disease, Immune mediated inflammatory diseases IMID, have shown poorer protection from Covid even after complete immunisation. This has been revealed in a meta analysis study conducted by a group of researchers from PGI, US and UK. Development of antibodies in some patients was as low as 70%. The study has been published in “Autoimmunity Reviews,” a high-impact Elsevier journal. Using 25 studies for the meta analysis, the study inferred that these patients can be potential candidates to monitor serological responses and can be considered for a booster dose. Due to shortage of vaccines, the dosing gap was enhanced from four weeks to 16 weeks. The study concluded that the gap should not be more than four weeks as soon after the second jab, the immune response improved in these patients. Dr Anuraag Jena and Dr Shubhra Mishra, lead co-authors of the paper, suggested that patients with these disorders could be candidates for testing for response to the double dose of Covid vaccine. Immune-mediated inflammatory diseases are a group of disorders resulting from malfunction of the body’s immune system and include common diseases like inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and vasculitis. “Immune responses in IMID are impaired perhaps due to the underlying disease and surely due to multiple immune modulatory drugs as well. Some of these medicines deplete the cells which produce antibodies. The class of drugs include anti-CD20 (Rituximab) or anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated antigen (CTLA-4) therapies,” said Prof Vishal Sharma, co-author, department of gastroenterology, PGI. However, the study does not suggest that the drugs should be stopped in such patients. The study also found that those suffering with rheumatoid arthritis and vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels) had less protection after vaccination as compared to those with systemic lupus erythematosus (autoimmune disease) Inflammatory bowel disease and spondyloarthropathy (group of inflammatory rheumatic diseases).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/autoimmune-diseases-may-hinder-vaccine-protection-study/articleshow/85814146.cms||Shimona Kanwar

---||Allahabad||IG, cops turn teacher for underprivileged children||Prayagraj: The Covid pandemic has immensely affected the education of underprivileged children during both the first and second waves. Children in slums, and backward areas, who could not even think of having access to smartphones and laptops to attend online classes, have now found a reason to smile. Cops posted at the office of the Inspector General of Police (IG Prayagraj range office) have come up with a noble plan to support and educate the underprivileged and needy children in helping them understand subjects like geography, political science, maths, computer, English etc. On Tuesday, Inspector General of police(Prayagraj range) K P Singh donned the hat of a teacher for the underprivileged children of the slum and taught geography and political science for the classes of seventh and eighth students. Interestingly, over 50 children attended the class for around an hour.IG told TOI that he would be teaching other subjects to unprivileged children every Tuesday evening. The initiative was taken by a cop named Ashish Mishra, who is a constable with the Prayagraj range office and had started teaching underprivileged children a few weeks back. Gradually, other policemen of different posts and ranks too joined him and decided to teach the children various subjects. Two years back, these classes were started and run by one Abhishek Shukla under the Suruwat organisation, who first started taking classes of privileged children at Tiranga Park, parade ground. When he came in contact with police officials, the senior police officials too expressed their willingness and constable Ashish Mishra was the first to take classes. Mishra, who had also done B.Ed., decided to take classes physically as the students were not able to afford smartphones or laptops to attend online classes. Most of the students are children of labourers living in the area nearby. The cop further informed that the classes are being conducted by following all the Covid-19 guidelines and social distancing rules. IG, however, appreciated the efforts of policemen doing the kind act and said there are other cops too on the list who extended their helping hand to these children and deserve appreciation for their contribution towards society.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/ig-cops-turn-teacher-for-underprivileged-children/articleshow/85818610.cms||---
---||Goa||Monuments in Goa that have stood for centuries face big climate threat||PANAJI: Monuments at Old Goa’s world heritage complex, as well as other heritage sites across Goa, are vulnerable to the dire impact of climate change. And this isn’t a distant threat — increased extreme weather events are already wrecking damage, soaking and triggering decay in the heritage buildings’ walls and foundations. A recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) has raised alarm over extreme weather, and the possibility of urbanisation amplifying some aspects of climate change. At Old Goa, in a heritage landscape already devastated by haphazard development, the climate crisis has already started unfolding. The historic monuments are caught on lowlevel ground between massive runoffs and a swelling river. Perhaps Goa’s most famous church, the Basilica of Bom Jesus, is at the lowest level in the core zone, and has been the worst hit after recent floods. “Increased precipitation, concretising, and paving is likely to reduce the ground’s water absorption capacity around the substantial built footprints in Old Goa,” said Poonam Verma Mascarenhas, conservation architect and former national coordinator, risk preparedness of heritage sites, ICOMOS-India, a Unesco advisory body. In another grim reminder of future events, a portion of the laterite structure at the 16th century Safa Masjid, Ponda, collapsed due to flooding in July. In faraway Tambdi Surla, about 50km from Panaji in the foothills of the Sahyadris, the 11th century Mahadev temple is facing increasing problems of rising dampness. A sizable number of these irreplaceable cultural resources are located in lowlying areas, valleys or on river banks. An already-high water table in catchment areas can aggravate the impact of flooding with extremely heavy rainfall and equally massive runoffs from concretised areas. At Old Goa and Ponda, unsustainable development on hill slopes and settlement areas and expansion of national highways has eaten into the green cover — the monuments’ buffer zones. “The increased water table is likely to disrupt the stability of the foundations of load-bearing buildings, which have survived for more than 500 years, while the maintenance of monuments will be much harder,” Verma said. The clearing of forested patches for housing on Kadamba plateau and loss of green buffer zone for highway expansion without drainage systems has changed the local hydrology. “A larger volume of water flow into the core area from slopes has been disastrous for the world heritage complex with a cluster of internationally-known monuments,” said architect Fernando Velho. The Basilica walls remain alarmingly damp for long, even during prolonged dry days, and other monuments too face some problems. In Ponda, the widened national highway passes on a higher gradient within the 100m zone of the Safa Masjid. “We have been requesting authorities for a few years to build drainage systems to divert the increased flow towards the monument,” said Murtuza Mulla, president of the Safa Masjid committee. The impact of movement of heavy traffic — that includes trailers and lorries — is beginning to show. “We can feel vibrations caused by moving vehicles inside the Masjid, despite measures to curb their speed,” Mulla said. Conservationists and others suggest various measures as part of preparedness for the climate crisis. The conservation of water bodies and paddy fields, which are sinks for runoffs from the hills, is considered vital in extreme weather. “It’s extremely distressing to see our wetlands being neglected and deliberately destroyed, though they protect the water table and biodiversity. Instead of notifying them, authorities are issuing building permissions freely on hills and plateaus,” said Heta Pandit, vice-chairperson, Goa heritage action group. Heritage lovers allege that a few monuments under the state government have been affected by neglectVerma said that houses, temples, churches and mosques which were built of laterite and lime plaster with tiled roofs on timber have withstood the challenge of time over centuries. “But now, the climate emergency is of an unpredictable nature, and thus, we need to undertake fresh empirical studies — urgently,” she said. An urgent scientific modelling of the site and structures with materiality in the context of climate predictions is what she suggests to comprehensively assess threats to monuments. “The materiality of all of Goa’s traditional buildings is similar to the Old Goa monuments, and such a study can be extrapolated to infer impacts for many of Goa’s built fabric located close to tidal rivers or the coast,” Verma said. From the planning aspect, the government has to implement special bylaws for Old Goa’s archaeological zones. “This has to include a drop in floor area ratio in the regulated zone to maximum 0.6 FAR,” Velho said. Hydro-geological studies around heritage sites and the habitated areas of Goa are becoming essential to assess and plan for safe deposits and to channel the water runoffs to minimize flooding. This needs to be done on priority, as threats to the irreplaceable monuments are looming too close. “All development plans — city and village — urgently need to be re-evaluated by allied experts, and examined through the portal of the climate crisis, to mitigate the threats through ‘planning with nature’,” Verma said. Protecting the existing watershed from future encroachment on the slopes in heritage areas is inevitable. “Acquiring land around monuments for gardens and tourism infrastructure can help avoid high density growth,” Velho said. The archaeological survey of India (ASI) has not announced or unveiled any action plan across the country to protect monuments from climate change. However, sources said that regular maintenance is being undertaken to tackle problems arising from extreme weather events. “ASI has installed lightning conductors at monuments under its charge, including at Old Goa. Maintenance of roofing is done and monitoring is increased during monsoon,” the source said. In the past, a few monuments had been damaged due to lightning strikes in extreme weather. More recently, the historic chapel of Our Lady of the Monte, Old Goa, was partly impacted by heavy rainfall during Cyclone Tauktae. However, a few monuments under the care of the state archives and archaeology department have been affected by neglect, heritage lovers alleged. Several efforts to contact officials of the state department proved futile.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/monuments-that-have-stood-for-centuries-face-pressing-climate-change-threat/articleshow/85816618.cms||Paul Fernandes

Even though the city claims to have vaccinated over 100% of the target population since August 15, the vaccination drive is continuing. “We are vaccinating people from adjoining states, including Himachal Pradesh and Punjab,” said director health services, UT, Dr Amandeep Kang. According to the DHS, more than 40% of city residents have been fully vaccinated. “We followed Government of India guidelines on beneficiaries of the target group. Other states inoculated their other beneficiaries without adhering to guidelines and in the process, their stocks were exhausted,” said the DHS. To cater to residents of colonies and villages, where people are reluctant to go to health centres for jabs, the health department launched mobile vans. “There were times when we exceeded 10,000 doses a day. However, there are some residents who are working outside Chandigarh and have started coming for the shots. These numbers are also adding to our daily vaccine tally,” said an official in the UT health department. Vaccination started in the city from January. A total of 11,14,608 doses have been administered, out of which 8,06,622 doses have been given as first dose. “We still have not got any communication from GoI regarding the correction of our target beneficiaries population. We had written several letters to the Union ministry of health and family welfare in this regard,” said the DHS.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/shot-in-the-arm-for-city-as-over-8000-jabbed-in-5-days/articleshow/85814221.cms||Shimona Kanwar
---||Delhi||Draft NCR Plan moots 5-10 year lease of land||NEW DELHI: The Draft Regional Plan 2041 for the NCR, which has been circulated among the member-states, has mooted short and medium term lease of land for 5-10 years with “plug and play” facilities instead of the current long term leases of 70-90 years. It has also envisaged a new category of land aggregators across NCR to sustain the “nimble” land arrangements of the future. In the draft Plan, NCR Planning Board (NCRPB) has proposed that there can be third party land aggregators, either in government or private sector or by both. “They would undertake land arrangements from land owners and consolidate them on one hand and enter into dynamic 5-10 years’ lease arrangements with investors/ industries on the other,” the document said. It says such arrangements would catalyse economic growth in the participating states by enabling fast-footed changes in economic production to adapt quickly to dynamic and fast-changing global markets. It has claimed that fast growing global economies like Vietnam and Taiwan are benefiting from such short-term land arrangements. However, the proposal of leasing of land to private entities to act as “aggregator” has met with objections from the Haryana government, TOI has learnt. The state government has told the NCRPB that the issue should be left to the states. The Draft Regional Plan, which focuses on efficient land use across the region, has proposed that the land use provisions should only specify a negative list of prohibited activities for ‘ease of doing’ business rather than putting an exhaustive list of what all activities are allowed. The proposed plan also envisages that the entire Central NCR (the region from the centre of Delhi up to Eastern and Western Peripheral Expressways) would be fully planned and covered under the notified areas of the authorities concerned. This means all non-notified areas in this region will be brought under development control norms for planned growth and development. It has said in the past, development authorities even adjacent to Delhi have been notifying controlled development areas around central focal towns towns and cities only and as a result, many pockets are left non-notified between different development authorities. Such areas have become pockets of haphazard growth despite being almost in the centre of NCR.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/draft-ncr-plan-moots-5-10-yr-lease-of-land/articleshow/85816624.cms||Dipak K Dash
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: NCP against local polls till OBC quota issue sorted||Mumbai: The Sharad Pawar-led NCP on Tuesday made it clear that unless the row over OBC reservations is resolved, it is not in favour of holding elections to local bodies in the state scheduled to be held in February-March 2022. At a meeting of NCP cabinet members and party leaders, Sharad Pawar reviewed the current political situation in the state, the performance of NCP cabinet members, setting up of state-run boards and enterprises, Enforcement Directorate cases against NCP and Shiv Sena leaders and the issue of OBC reservation. “The party’s view is that unless the row over OBC reservations is resolved, NCP will not support the electoral process for the local bodies,” NCP spokesperson and skill development minister Nawab Malik told TOI. Recently, the Supreme Court struck down reservation for OBCs in local bodies across the country. Its observation was that in several local bodies, reservation was more than the 50% ceiling. In Maharashtra, it was found that exact data on OBCs was not available owing to non-constitution of the OBC commission. CM Uddhav Thackeray had recently convened an all-party meeting to take stock of the situation. Leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis has taken the view that at least now, the state should take quick steps for gathering empirical data. Malik said in view of possibility of elections to local bodies, the party network should be galvanized. Each NCP leader has been assigned one district, so that he can immediately launch preparations for the polls. “While no decision has been taken on contesting the elections jointly with Sena and Congress, it has been left to the district-level leadership to take a call on contesting elections jointly,” Malik said. He said there was discussion on performance of guardian ministers. “It was felt NCP should concentrate on two departments, minority and social justice, which are held by NCP cabinet members,” Malik said. On action taken by ED, Malik alleged BJP was targeting Sena and NCP cabinet members. “We are alert about ED actions and are seeking legal opinion. Our view is that no Sena or NCP cabinet member is involved in money laundering,” Malik said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ncp-against-local-polls-till-obc-quota-issue-sorted/articleshow/85818603.cms||---

---||Mysuru||Mysuru: Accused in rape case targeted lone women, couples, say police||MYSURU: The five arrested accused in the Mysuru gang-rape case are not first time offenders, say police. Five youths including a juvenile have been arrested and another person was detained in connection with the crime. All the arrested are from Tamil Nadu while one is still on the run. The gang, according to police, frequented Mysuru and allegedly robbed couples and women at isolated places and on outer ring road before heading back to Erode and Tiruppur districts of Tamil Nadu. All those in police custody are daily-wage earners and work in markets and yards transporting and loading/unloading vegetables to eke out a living. One among them was arrested in a sandal tree theft case a few months ago. He used to identify sandal trees on the campus of agencies in the morning and then cut them in the night before transporting them to Tamil Nadu. He was out on bail, police stated. Some time back police too launched an operation to check road robberies in Mysuru after sun down following a few back to back cases. The gang members used to target lone travellers and rob them of their jewels in the evening at secluded places including outer ring road. The fact that none of the victims had filed a complaint emboldened them, say police. Police commissioner Chandragupta said police are also verifying the criminal antecedents of the arrested accused. An officer said two of the accused have a criminal background and are involved in robberies both in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Police are looking for leads about their past history which could be of help in the investigation. The prime accused had married a girl from Mysuru and often visited the city along with family. On the way back to TN, he and his gang took sandal trees felled from government office premises. It is suspected the absconding accused too was involved in sandal theft. Cops should be alert, says STS:District in-charge minister ST Somashekar on Tuesday warned the Mysuru city police that they will face action if heinous crimes are not curbed in the city. Referring to cracking of jewellery shop heist and murder, and gang-rape case within a short span of time, he said it is good policing. Speaking to reporters, he said he will discuss with Mysuru police commissioner Chandragupta on reviving the Chamundi Pade, which was designed to focus on woman safety in public places. He said Mysuru’s image as a peaceful city will not be allowed to tamper with by the miscreants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/accused-in-rape-case-targetted-couples-lone-women-police/articleshow/85811594.cms||Lawrence Milton
---||Allahabad||ABAP chief: Centre should introduce popn control bill||Prayagraj: Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad (ABAP) president Narendra Giri has demanded that on the lines of Yogi Adityanath-led government in Uttar Pradesh, the Centre should also introduce a population control bill for “maintaining religious and social structure balance in the country”. “The bill should be such that it should be binding on every state, there should not be an option for any state government. The Akhara Parishad appeals to the Union home minister Amit Shah and Prime Minister Narendra Modi that the country should have such a law which helps in maintaining the crucial balance between various communities,” said president of ABAP, the apex decision-making body of the 13 recognised Hindu monastic orders of the country, on Tuesday. On the issue of a few Muslim clerics allegedly supporting the Taliban, Giri once again reiterated that the government should take strict action against such leaders for supporting the Taliban. “The city of Kandahar in Afghanistan was once ruled by a Hindu king, as is mentioned in our epic Mahabharata. However, today people of Hindu and Sikh communities are leaving Afghanistan in fear which is a blatant example of what can happen in India if the population balance amongst the two main communities is not maintained,” he elaborated. He also appealed to the Muslim religious leaders to take action against people of their community who support the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan. “Those who support a terrorist organisation like the Taliban should be treated as traitors and arrested. How can one speak in favour of an organisation which gets open support of our enemy nation Pakistan,” questioned Giri. Welcoming CM Yogi’s statement regarding implementing a ban on the sale of liquor and meat in Mathura, ABAP president termed this as a “landmark move”. Earlier, while speaking at the Krishnotsava 2021 programme at Mathura on Monday night, CM Yogi had announced a complete ban on the sale of liquor and meat in Mathura. He had also suggested that those engaged in the liquor and meat trade may take up selling milk to revive the glory of Mathura, which was known for producing a huge quantity of milk in earlier days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/abap-chief-centre-should-introduce-popn-control-bill/articleshow/85818616.cms||---

Shopkeepers have been instructed to not allow people without masks inside their shops. A special team has been formed to check and take action against those violating Covid protocol. DC Vinay Pratap Singh warned Panchkula residents against any negligence saying that this could precipitate the third wave. Underlining the need for public support to stop the third wave, the DC asked people to avoid going to public places during the forthcoming festive season. He also asked people going out of their homes to wear masks, maintain social distancing and use sanitiser while going out and coming back. “Social and religious festivals play an important part in our lives but we have to break the chain of Covid so that a third wave does not come and affect our lives again. It is a request to everyone to follow Covid guidelines while going out or coming back to their house,” he said. Saying that data showed that vaccination had helped break the chain of transmission, the DC asked everyone above 18 to get vaccinated. The administration has taken various steps to prevent the third wave, said the DC. At present, he said, the focus is on increasing vaccination, he said, adding that dedicated teams would visit market areas to educate people about maintaining social distancing and wear masks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pkl-dc-warns-of-third-wave-asks-people-to-follow-covid-sops/articleshow/85814268.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Goa||Starting today, 16,000 litres of free water to every household in Goa||PANAJI: Goa will become the first state in the country to supply free water to 60% of its citizens from Wednesday onwards, chief minister Pramod Sawant said. He launched the Save Water to Get Free Water scheme on Tuesday under which households will not be charged for consumption of up to 16,000 litres. “From September 1, 60% of the people of the state will not get water bills. Free water means zero water charges, zero meter rent and zero bills. Those covered under this will also not get sewerage bills,” Sawant said, adding that just because the water is free people must not waste it. “We have said save water to get free water. I am confident that the people of Goa will participate in the campaign,” he said, urging the maximum number of people to join in saving water. “If people join the campaign then those facing water shortage will benefit,” Sawant said. He said that it has also been decided to bill small businesses as per commercial rates instead of industrial rates. “We have decided to shift the water bills of small businesses, including that of restaurants, from the industrial to the commercial category. This will benefit them as their water bills will be reduced in a big way,” Sawant said. The state government has also decided to extend the one-time settlement scheme (OTS) for water bill defaulters by another two months. In a virtual address to the people of the state, Sawant said, “When I presented the budget in the Goa legislative assembly, I promised people that I would reduce their water bills. I had also reiterated the assurance in my Independence Day speech saying that from September 1 the water bill would be reduced.” He added that those living in housing societies would also be benefited as the water consumption of one meter would be divided among the total number of flats in the complex.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/starting-today-16k-litres-of-free-water-to-every-household/articleshow/85816640.cms||---

The SAD core committee, in a meeting chaired by party president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Tuesday, said: “The statements from farm unions have totally exposed the mischievous elements disguised as farmers but sponsored by agencies of the central government and backed and supported by Capt Amarinder Singh. Punjab Police are just facilitating these disruptive elements.” The core committee also said these mischievous elements were working to bring President’s rule in Punjab and inflict an unrepresentative, anti-Punjab and anti-farmer establishment on the people. The core committee said SAD had been categorical from the start in its support to the movement against the laws enacted by the central government. Harcharan Bains, principal advisor to the SAD president, said the party thanked the people of Punjab for the overwhelming response to the 100-day 100 constituencies mass-contact programme of the SAD president and said these programmes will continue as scheduled. In another resolution, the core committee congratulated the Khalsa Panth, the Delhi Sikhs and the rank and file of the SAD for the victory of the party in the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee(DSGMC) elections.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sad-says-bid-to-disturb-peace-in-punjab/articleshow/85816627.cms||---

---||India||China expands its activities to Sri Lanka’s north; India worried||NEW DELHI: Red flags are going up in India over China’s fresh attempts to expand its footprint in northern Sri Lanka in the garb of infrastructure projects, with Beijing even making efforts to woo the ethnic Tamil community there. China, which has already made deep strategic inroads into Sri Lanka through its predatory debt policies, is now assiduously working towards establishing its presence on the island nation as close to the Indian coast as possible, say sources in the Indian security establishment. “Proliferation of Chinese economic activity and proposed infrastructure development projects in the Northern province of Sri Lanka, which could be later exploited for strategic reasons, is certainly a matter of concern for India,” said a source. Earlier, the Chinese projects were largely restricted to southern Sri Lanka. “But the Gotabaya Rajapaksa government is now facilitating several Chinese ventures in northern Sri Lanka as well, often ignoring sentiments of Tamil residents there. We are closely monitoring the developments,” he added. India has already protested against Sri Lanka’s decision to award a $12 million hybrid wind and solar energy project to the Chinese Sinosar-Etechwin joint venture in three islets off the Jaffna Peninsula in February this year. With the islets being barely 50 km from the Tamil Nadu coast, India has countered with an offer of a $12 million grant to Sri Lanka for execution of the projects. “Another Chinese joint venture has been allotted land in a coastal village in northern Sri Lanka for farming sea cucumber fish despite protests by local farmers. Several such inroads in the region are being observed,” said another source. India, of course, continues to be upset with Sri Lanka for going back on its tripartite pact to jointly develop the East Container Terminal at the Colombo Port along with Japan. Then there are also festering differences over the oil tanks farm project at Trincomalee. But it has been smooth sailing for China in the island nation, from the 99-year lease of the Hambantota port to the new Colombo Port City Project. Apart from Sri Lanka, China has been systematically spreading its wings in the entire Indian Ocean Region (IOR) by forging maritime links with Seychelles,Mauritius, Maldives, Bangladesh, Myanmar and east African countries, among others.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/china-expands-its-activities-to-sri-lankas-north-india-worried/articleshow/85820642.cms||Rajat Pandit

Addressing the media on the concluding of his two-day tour of the Seraikela-Kharsawan district, Marandi said, “This government is openly endorsing the loot culture and shielding the forces involved in illegal and unethical culture business activities.” He also criticised the New Delhi conclave saying Soren is wooing corporates to Jharkhand while being indifferent to the fact that a chunk of the industries in the state is in a shambles apart from several industrial projects failing to take off because of non-cooperation from the government. “In the 18 months of Soren’s government, the state has reported increasing cases of smuggling of sand, stone, coal and iron ore,” Marandi said, adding that robbery, ornament snatching and killings have increased in the state. Responding to a question, Marandi claimed that the state government is not willing to hold the three-tier panchayat elections on a party basis because it “fears BJP will win the overwhelming number of seats if elections”. He also charged the government with using the Covid-19 pandemic as a shield to protect itself from the growing anger of the people. The tribal face of BJP further said the government have not fulfilled promises it made to the masses in the 2019 assembly elections. “Had the government been sincere, it would have made progress on fulfilling the promises on jobs and grants to unemployed youths among others,” Marandi claimed. He further claimed that the government is fast losing the trust of the people because of its acts of omission, which are exposed in the Covid period. Marandi also claimed the state government did not implement the central government-sponsored project to provide tap water to every household in the state properly. “Tap water scheme is a 100% central government-sponsored project and the state government is claiming that it did not have funds to implement the scheme,” Marandi added. He also defended the domicile policy of the previous Raghubar Das government as fair and framed in the interest of the residents of Jharkhand. “The coalition government led by JMM overturned the policy,” the BJP leader charged. When asked about the reason behind the poor show of party in all 14 assembly seats in the Kolhan division in the assembly polls, the veteran BJP leader remained elusive but said the party will improve its position in the coming elections. Earlier on Monday, Marandi took part in the executive committee meeting of the district ST cell of the party. While addressing the party workers during the meeting, Marandi claimed the transfer and posting “industry” is flourishing like never before since the JMM-led alliance came to the power.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/govt-machinery-being-misused-to-extort-people-says-babulal/articleshow/85814522.cms||B Sridhar
---||Rajkot||‘Certificates to aid in insurance claims’||Rajkot: The state forest department has assured that the certificate issued to the registered snake rescuers will suffice for claiming insurance in the event of any mishap during the dangerous operations. The department had issued a guideline on March 30 forbidding people from rescuing snakes without proper training and its formal recognition. All rescuers, who work voluntarily, have to perform their work at the behest of the forest department only. Some provisions in the policy have created resentment and confusion among the 2,000-odd rescuers working all over Gujarat. One of them was mandatory Rs 10 lakh insurance to be taken by the rescuers, who argued that insurance companies would be reluctant to cover them given the high risk job and not pass their claim in case of death due to snake bike. “The certificate issued to the rescuer by the department will help them in processing the claim. There are a couple of insurance companies who cover the risk of Rs 10 lakh in case of death by snake bite while rescuing with the premium of Rs 500 to Rs 1,000 per annum,” said S K Srivastava, additional principal chief conservator of forest (APCCF). However, officials categorically stated that those who can’t afford ‘such a meagre premium’ should not involve in snake rescue work. The policy also has it that rescuers won’t be allowed to charge more then Rs 250 for rescue work. “They should not indulge in dangerous activity,” said Srivastava, adding that all the snakes are covered in wildlife protection Act and catching them without authorisation even with good intention is an offence. The forest department does not want rescuers to work independently as they had been doing till now. However, some NGOs and volunteers who are engaged in this activity demand to be allowed to work on their own. These NGOs argue that complaints route through the forest department take up crucial time. However, the department is firm on its stand looking at the legal issues involved with the work. “We are being protectors of wildlife.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/certificates-to-aid-in-insurance-claims/articleshow/85813154.cms||---

Election for the 14 seats in registered graduates constituency will be the first in the series of elections that will be held for the formation of new senate body. The local unit of BJP is taking keen interest in this constituency from where most vocal critics of the university administration get elected. Senate members Kapil Joshi and Nikul Patel along with advocate Kishore Pillai on Tuesday submitted a memorandum to university registrar K M Chudasama alleging that registration of voters was allowed beyond the set deadline. “Even as 4 pm of August 18 was the deadline for offline registration of voters, registrations continued way beyond the stipulated time mentioned in the university notification,” said Joshi. The trio has demanded that challans of such registrations should be cancelled. “We have also demanded that the scrutiny committee should have representation of the candidates who are contesting the polls so that no registration is wrongly rejected,” said Joshi. The trio have also demanded that unauthorized persons should not have access to contact details of the registered graduates to ensure that voters are not threatened by anybody. Before the trio made the representation, they sat on a dharna at the university head office when some media persons who were accompanying them were not allowed entry inside the registrar’s cabin. Chudasama later accepted the memorandum outside his cabin.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/senators-demand-free-fair-elections/articleshow/85811339.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Training of Jharkhand cops set to resume as Covid infection remains low||RANCHI: After a gap of almost 16 months, Jharkhand Police has decided to resume training and internal examinations of its personnel from September 6 as the number of Covid cases have remained low in the state for the past several days. Notably, the training of the police personnel was suspended in March 2020 after the imposition of the lockdown. The police administration wanted to start the process this year but it was postponed in April because of the second wave of the pandemic. Sources said the training of sub-inspectors (SI) was suspended mid-way in March 2020 and they would now undergo schooling in anti-extremist operations in different batches. A group of 260 SIs in batches of 140 and 120 would undergo training at the Padma centre of Hazaribag and the Tendergram centre in Ranchi from September 6. The SIs are currently posted at different police stations in the state. The first batch of 260 SIs out of a total of 2,400 had completed their training when the exercise was suspended. Besides, the examinations of six directly recruited DSPs, who have completed their one-year training, would be held at the Jharkhand Police Academy (JPA) in Hazaribag. Another batch of 30 promoted DSPs would also undergo training for two months at the JPA. In addition, the personnel of the India Reserve Battalion and the special India Reserve Battalion will undergo training. One company of the Seema Suraksha Bal, which is engaged in anti-extremist operations, will also undergo an orientation programme to adapt to the situation in Jharkhand. The large backlog of promotional courses for jawans to havildars and ASIs will also start. The supervisor for counter-insurgency and anti-terrorists (CIAT) schools, Colonel K A Khan said, “The government has prescribed elaborate rules for preventing Covid infections during the exercise. Therefore, all trainees and instructors should get both doses of Covid vaccines before joining. Mask the training. Wearing masks is essential while stress would also be laid on social distancing. We will also keep a watch to detect Covid-like symptoms developing on any of the personnel.” He added that the number of trainees in each batch has been reduced to maintain social distancing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/training-of-cops-set-to-resume-as-covid-infection-remains-low/articleshow/85814326.cms||Sanjay Sahay
---||Ranchi||JMM attacks BJP over DVC row||Ranchi: JMM on Tuesday said BJP parliamentarians from Jharkhand, including three Union ministers, are shying away from asking the Centre questions that concern the people of the state. JMM criticised the ‘silence’ of 16 BJP MPs — of which 12 are members of the Lok Sabha and four are in Rajya Sabha — over the Union power ministry’s deductions from Jharkhand’s Reserve Bank of India (RBI) account to clear the dues owed by the Jharkhand Bijli Vitran Nigam Limited to the Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC). “The Union power ministry deducted Rs 714 crore from Jharkhand’s RBI account this month and issued a notice to the state energy department that Rs 2,100 crore will be deducted in two instalments, one in September and the other in December. The money was deducted even after the state government informed the Centre about the cabinet’s decision to exit the tripartite agreement between the Union power ministry and the DVC. The deductions also came even as Jharkhand is paying Rs 125 crore each month to the DVC to settle its outstanding dues,” JMM general secretary Vinod Kumar Pandey said at a press conference. Pandey claimed that the Centre’s high-handedness clearly indicated its partisanship. “BJP-governed states such as Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh have dues running into thousands of crores, but they are not being put through such financial stress. The Centre is ignorant of the fact that the economy of Jharkhand is under duress due to the Covid-19 pandemic. At the same time, it is reluctant to release the GST and other dues of the state despite repeated requests from the chief minister and the finance minister,” Pandey claimed. Finance minister Rameshwar Oraon recently said the deductions to settle DVC’s dues have made it difficult for the state government to pay the monthly salaries of its employees. So far, the Centre has auto debited approximately Rs 2,100 crore from Jharkhand’s RBI account to settle DVC’s dues of Rs 5,608 crore between 2015 and 2017. Pandey said that JMM deliberated on enforcing an economic blockade in the state to force the Centre to mend its ways but did not pursue the plan after considering the plight of Jharkhand’s people owing to the Covid-19 pandemic. “We are looking for solutions. The BJP MPs from Jharkhand have not said a word about it. We urge them to coordinate between the Centre and the state for the sake of Jharkhand’s welfare. The CM is ready to sit for a discussion with them if they are willing,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jmm-attacks-bjp-over-dvc-row/articleshow/85814375.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||Jamshedpur||Training of Jharkhand cops set to resume as Covid infection remains low||RANCHI: After a gap of almost 16 months, Jharkhand Police has decided to resume training and internal examinations of its personnel from September 6 as the number of Covid cases have remained low in the state for the past several days. Notably, the training of the police personnel was suspended in March 2020 after the imposition of the lockdown. The police administration wanted to start the process this year but it was postponed in April because of the second wave of the pandemic. Sources said the training of sub-inspectors (SI) was suspended mid-way in March 2020 and they would now undergo schooling in anti-extremist operations in different batches. A group of 260 SIs in batches of 140 and 120 would undergo training at the Padma centre of Hazaribag and the Tendergram centre in Ranchi from September 6. The SIs are currently posted at different police stations in the state. The first batch of 260 SIs out of a total of 2,400 had completed their training when the exercise was suspended. Besides, the examinations of six directly recruited DSPs, who have completed their one-year training, would be held at the Jharkhand Police Academy (JPA) in Hazaribag. Another batch of 30 promoted DSPs would also undergo training for two months at the JPA. In addition, the personnel of the India Reserve Battalion and the special India Reserve Battalion will undergo training. One company of the Seema Suraksha Bal, which is engaged in anti-extremist operations, will also undergo an orientation programme to adapt to the situation in Jharkhand. The large backlog of promotional courses for jawans to havildars and ASIs will also start. The supervisor for counter-insurgency and anti-terrorists (CIAT) schools, Colonel K A Khan said, “The government has prescribed elaborate rules for preventing Covid infections during the exercise. Therefore, all trainees and instructors should get both doses of Covid vaccines before joining. Mask the training. Wearing masks is essential while stress would also be laid on social distancing. We will also keep a watch to detect Covid-like symptoms developing on any of the personnel.” He added that the number of trainees in each batch has been reduced to maintain social distancing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/training-of-cops-set-to-resume-as-covid-infection-remains-low/articleshow/85822598.cms||Sanjay Sahay
---||Ranchi||Pocso court awards RI of 20 years to Bokaro youth for raping minor||Bokaro: The Pocso court of Bokaro on Tuesday sentenced a youth to 20 years’ rigorous imprisonment for raping a minor two years back. The court of additional district judge-3, Rajeev Ranjan, held accused Chatur Soren (20) guilty for raping a class 8 student by kidnapping her while she was going to school. At the time of incident, the victim was 14 and Soren, a resident of Rajganj, Dhanbad, was 18 years old. The girl’s father had lodged an FIR on July 12, 2019. The Pocso court awarded seven years’ rigorous imprisonment under section 366 (A) of IPC and imposed a fine of Rs 5,000 in the kidnapping case. Finding him guilty under section 4(2) of the POCSO Act, Soren has been sentenced to 20 years’ rigorous imprisonment and fined Rs 5,000. Failure to pay the fine will result in additional imprisonment of one month. “Both the sentences will run concurrently,” said Sanjay Kumar Jha, special public prosecutor (SPP), Pocso. He said the incident took place when the victim was going to school with her 16-year-old elder sister and another female friend. On the way, Soren and his friend took the three girls on two motorcycles to Rajganj, Dhanbad. When the three girls did not come home in the evening, the parents got worried and started looking for them. In the morning, the father of the siblings, after being tipped off, went to Rajganj and found all three. But Soren only let go of two girls. The father brought back both the girls and then sought help of the police to rescue his youngest daughter. The victim said in her statement before the court that Soren did nothing to her, her sister or her friend at night. It was only after they left that he raped her. Jha said, “A total of 10 witnesses were examined in this case.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/pocso-court-awards-ri-of-20-years-to-bokaro-youth-for-raping-minor/articleshow/85814468.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The girl told cops that the accused Arif Malek tried to hold her when she was returning home on Monday afternoon. The girl tried to escape by freeing herself, but Malek chased and nabbed her again before dragging her away in the bushes nearby. As the girl was shouting, Malek gagged her and threatened to kill her if she shouted again. Malek allegedly raped the girl and as the girl had shouted for help, her cousin who was passing by went in direction of the noise. Seeing the girl’s cousin approaching, Malek ran away. The girl’s cousin took her home where she told her parents about Malek’s crime. Her uncle later called 181 Abhayam helpline and an offence of rape, criminal intimidation and violation of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act was registered against Malek.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/padra-farmer-held-for-raping-minor-from-his-village/articleshow/85811502.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Punjab witnesses 50 Covid cases among fully vaccinated people, 30 of re-infection||CHANDIGARH: The detection of 50 cases of breakthrough infection - patients contracting the Covid virus after getting vaccinated -- in Punjab in the last few months has underlined the need for people not to let their guard down and to continue following the safety norms even after getting jabbed. Besides breakthrough infections, around 30 cases of re-infection have also been recorded in the state in the last few months. These are the cases in which the recovered patients developed symptoms and were tested positive for Covid-19 and had to undergo the treatment again. No death among such patients has been reported in the state so far. Vaccinated people getting infected has not come as a surprise for the health experts as anti-Covid vaccines do not provide full protection. However, vaccines do reduce the severity of the infection and chances of death. A pan-India study by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), findings of which were recently published, had held the highly contagious Delta (B.1.6172) variant of Covid to be the major reason for breakthrough infection. In Punjab, Delta, which is said to be up to 50% more transmissible than other lineages of Covid, is the most prevalent variant. If not controlled, it spreads at a faster pace, resulting in an increase in hospitalisation and fatality. As per the latest data of the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG), a total of 2,072 samples have been tested positive for variants of concern that account for 4% of total variants of concerns detected in the country. Of the total, 838 samples are of Delta variant. Samples of breakthrough infection and patients contracting the virus for a second time have been sent for genome sequencing to ascertain whether they were carrying the old virus or some mutant strain. Explaining the reasons for this, Punjab Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar said breakthrough and re-infection happens mostly among people with low immunity levels. He urged people to continue to wear masks, avoiding crowded places, maintaining social distance and hand hygiene – even after recovering and taking vaccine shots. According to health experts, protective antibodies developed by recovered patients are not likely to remain in the body for more than six months. The levels of antibodies start to drop rapidly after the virus is cleared from the body. Dr Rakesh Kumar Gupta, president of Strategic Institute for Public Health Education and Research (SIPHER) laid stress on people continuing to take precautions and following appropriate Covid protocol/guidelines even after getting vaccinated. Dr Gupta further said that there is a possibility of a rise in the number of re-infections in future as it has been more than a year since the pandemic broke out and the immunity in recovered patients is for a very limited time. The pace of Covid vaccination has picked pace in Punjab, but it is yet to catch up with the neighbouring states. In the last 15 days, the health authorities vaccinated 92,144 people on average per day. During the last two weeks, the highest of 3,38,892 individuals were immunised on August 24. The daily count of vaccination was recorded at over one lakh on nine days.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/punjab-sees-50-cases-of-breakthrough-infection-30-of-re-infection/articleshow/85817358.cms||Vinod Kumar

Of the old count included in the tally, 19 were added after reconciliation of data while in 37 cases, the treatment outcome of patients which was recorded as discharged has been changed to death. Punjab Covid nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar stated that in all the 56 old deaths, the district health authorities were not supplied with the records of patients by hospitals where they had succumbed to the virus. Punjab has been struggling in maintaining an accurate daily death count, forcing it to make additions later after the reconciliation of data. In August, the health department has added 131 old deaths. Of 21 cases surfaced in the last 24 hours, three each were from Ludhiana and Amritsar, two each from Bathinda, Fardikot, Ropar and Mohali, and one each in Barnala, Fatehgarh Sahib, Gurdaspur, Jalandhar, Patiala, Sangrur and Tarn Taran.

A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah said the text of a written order is what is binding and issuing oral directions does not form a part of the judicial record and must be eschewed. The court passed the observation while noting that a single judge bench of Gujarat HC has passed an oral direction not to arrest an accused in a forgery case. “Oral directions of this nature are liable to cause serious misgivings. Judicial assessments change with the roster. Absent of a written record of what has transpired in the course of a judicial proceeding, it would set a dangerous precedent if the parties and the investigating officer were expected to rely on unrecorded oral observations,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/oral-directions-by-judges-unacceptable/articleshow/85820792.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Haryana active Covid cases drop to less than half overnight||CHANDIGARH: Active Covid-19 cases in Haryana dropped to less than half in a day, raising some eyebrows. On Monday, the health bulletin had reported 646 active cases and on Tuesday it had come down to 290. What’s more, the numbers did not add up and efforts to get clarifications from the state health authorities met with failure. According to the Tuesday’s bulletin, the cumulative count of Covid cases was reported to be 7,70,486. However, cured cases were 7,60,175, deaths 9,677 and active cases 290, which added up to 7,70,142, leaving a gap of 344. Multiple attempts to contact director general of health services (DGHS) Veena Singh to seek clarification failed. When contacted, additional chief secretary health Rajeev Arora expressed inability to comment on the account of being in a meeting with officials via videoconference. He, however, assured to look into the issue and revert back on Wednesday. This is for the third time that Haryana health bulletin has come under the scanner recently. Earlier, it was on the account of positivity rate of the day during the second wave. The health authorities had been providing details of cumulative positivity rate and death rate and avoided giving the daily percentage figures. Second time, the state had come under criticism over the issue of deaths due to oxygen and the overall death count. The state health officials have been claiming that they were leaving out the number of deaths of patients hailing from outside Haryana even when they passed away in the state. Meanwhile, 20 new cases, two deaths and 23 recoveries reported on Tuesday. In addition, 1.50 vaccine doses were administered on Tuesday. Of these, 1,05,503 were first doses, while 45,074 were second doses. Other than Nuh and Fatehabad, which have no active cases, five more districts have five or less active cases. One death each was reported from Yamunanangar and Karnal. Highest four cases each were reported from Gurgaon and Panchkula each, followed by three from Karnal, two cases each from Jhajjar, Rewari and Yamunanangar districts. One case each was reported from Ambala, Kurukshetra and Palwal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/haryana-active-cases-drop-to-less-than-half-overnight/articleshow/85817556.cms||Manvir Saini

It is the first time an AIUDF legislator has resigned. Phanidhar Talukdar, MLA from Bhabanipur legislative constituency, is likely to join BJP here in presence of Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma on Wednesday. There had been speculation since last few weeks that he would join BJP. He had contested the state assembly polls early this year on an AIUDF ticket and defeated Asom Gana Parishad candidate Ranjit Deka. AIUDF general secretary (organising) Aminul Islam accused BJP of “blackmailing” and “pressuring” Talukday to join the party. “He has also been lured with the promise of power,” he said. With Talukdar’s resignation from membership of Assam assembly, the number of vacant seats will go up to six.

Manjalpur police auctioned his bike along with several other vehicles even before the man’s trial concluded. Dinesh Parmar had filed an application in a sessions court here in December 2019 to reclaim his bike which the investigators had seized as muddamaal in 2015. Parmar filed the application as the trial court acquitted him in July 2018 and there was no appeal pending against him. On getting his application, court sent a notice to the police to file their response. But Parmar was shocked when the police claimed before the court that his bike was already auctioned with several other seized vehicles in April 2017. Interestingly, when the trial court had acquitted Parmar in 2018, it had also directed the police to return his bike after the period ends. Police told the court that the auction of vehicles generated Rs 5.8 lakh, of which Parmar’s bike was sold for Rs 15,000. Since the bike was not available, the court asked Parmar if he was ready to accept the money. Even though dismayed, Parmar agreed to accept the money and the court asked Manjalpur police to hand him a cheque and submit its documents with the court. Parmar, a resident of Manjalpur, was arrested in July 2015 for allegedly abducting a minor girl from his neighbourhood by luring her of marriage and later allegedly raping her.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/cops-auction-bike-during-rape-trial-acquitted-man-gets-rs-15k/articleshow/85811561.cms||Jay Pachchigar

But Khusbhu Chitaniya chose to be virtuous and saved three lives by donating her husband’s body organs through charity. “People ask me why I didn’t seek financial help in lieu of organ donation but that would have been a financial transaction. I wanted to do something good in the name of my husband and I am glad that his organs could save three lives,” Khushbu, who has moved from her apartment in Dubai to a dormitory, after she was unable to pay house rent, told TOI. That charity, however, didn’t resolve her responsibility in Dubai as her fate hangs in a balance as she may even face a jail term. “I am stuck in Dubai as I have to pay over 1.43 lakh dirhams towards rent. Without settling the dues, I can’t leave this country and I don’t have that kind of money as I was always a housewife. I don’t know what I will do,” said the woman who is desperate to reunite with her daughter in Surat as she too is alone there. Chitaniyas had moved from Surat to Dubai after Nilesh Chitaniya, an AC technician, in 2011 started his business there. Their life was perfect till 2017 when the husband suffered a road accident and landed in the hospital. “He suffered severe injuries and went into coma. The treatment went on for four years and our earning too stopped completely. We couldn’t pay our house as well as workspace rent,” said the woman who spent about 2.3 lakh dirhams on medical expenses after taking financial help from friends and family. “Last month, the doctors declared Nilesh brain dead and said that even if he survives he would be completely paralysed. So, I immediately decided to donate his organs with the guidance of our community member, Saurabh Pachchigar, who is settled in Dubai,” Khushbu said. Nilesh’s lungs were implanted in a 35-year-old man, one kidney went to a 57-year-old man and liver was implanted in a 43-year-old man in Dubai. “We convinced the house owner to waive off the pending rent and he agreed. Now she has to pay 1.43 lakh dirhams of shop rent. We are trying to get in touch with the property owner who is settled in Saudi Arabia. Our Gujarati community settled in Dubai is extending her financial help. We are also in touch with the Indian embassy,” said Saurabh Pachchigar, a businessman, who shifted to Dubai in 2007. “Khushbu has got appreciation letters from the government here for organ donation. We are hoping to resolve the issue quickly so that she can return to her family in India,” Pachchigar added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/debt-ridden-widows-charity-in-dubai-saves-three-lives/articleshow/85811728.cms||Tushar Tere
---||Hyderabad||Don’t compel students to attend classes in school: Telangana high court||HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Tuesday directed schools, both government and private, that they cannot compel a student to attend school in person if his or her parents are not inclined to send their wards to the institution. Educational institutions across the state are set to reopen on September 1. A bench of acting Chief Justice MS Ramachandra Rao and Justice T Vinod Kumar also directed the state, social welfare and tribal welfare wings not to reopen residential schools until further orders. “Any undertaking, obtained by any school management absolving it of any liability if the child gets infected with coronavirus while in school, shall not have any legal effect and shall be construed as having been given under duress and as contrary to public policy. No punishment should be given to children who fail to attend physical classes,” the court said. The HC gave several other interim directions while hearing a PIL filed by Balakrishna Mandapati of East Marredpally in Secunderabad, who had challenged the decision of the school education department ordering reopening of even pre-primary and primary schools. Can’t penalise schools that prefer online classes: CourtThe bench expanded the scope of the PIL prayer and said all children up to class 10 were vulnerable, asymptomatic, and unvaccinated and hence fall under a single category that requires concern and protection. “They are a young lot and it is difficult to ensure that they remain masked throughout the school hours,” the bench said. “Neither the school management nor the state should compel them to physically attend classes. If a particular school is not to reopen its premises for physical functioning and instead would prefer to conduct online classes, the state cannot penalise such institutions...,” the bench said. The judges said that “coronavirus is still present in the country and has mutated itself into several variants”. Two waves were over and a third is on the cards, which is predicted to hit the country in September-October. School children interact closely with teachers and non-teaching staff and it is not the case of the state that all such were fully vaccinated by now. Children might get infected from them and inadvertently become asymptomatic carriers of the virus, the bench said. The court also said that there were certain sections of parents and school managements, for equally different good reasons might wish to have offline classes. “This order is applicable to government and private schools and covers all children up to class 10 and not just primary and preprimary classes,” the bench said. “Those private schools who want to run their schools physically could do so after following all standard procedures,” it added. For government residential schools, the bench stayed their reopening and directed the state to explain the precautions it has taken and arrangements made like increased medical facilities if the children were hit by the virus. The expert advisory committee attached to the disaster management wing should also furnish a report on the status, the bench said and posted the case to October 4.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/dont-compel-students-to-attend-classes-in-school-telangana-high-court/articleshow/85820841.cms||---

Presiding over a meeting via video conferencing with deputy commissioners, superintendents of police and chief medical officers, principals of medical colleges, medical superintendents, sub-divisional magistrates and block development officers of the state from Shimla, the CM said 90 LED screens would be installed at different parts of the state such as district, sub-division and block development headquarters besides other prominent places so that people could participate in this mega event. He said health workers would also interact with the Prime Minister and share their views regarding making this vaccination campaign a success. He said all the deputy commissioners must launch special mop up round to vaccinate any left-out persons. He said that special focus must be laid on identifying difficult pockets such as Bara Bhangal in Kangra district, Malana in Kullu district and Dodra Kwar in Shimla district so that any left-out persons could be identified and vaccinated accordingly. He also directed the officers to identify a few doctors, para medical staff, ASHA workers or any other front-line workers who have performed their duties in an exceptional way in difficult circumstances. Thakur said the state government would provide vaccine to few left out people of Bara Bhangal area of Kangra district for which special sortie of a state helicopter would be conducted. Chief secretary Ram Subhag Singh directed the officers to ensure that all the left out people, if any, should be vaccinated by September 4 by launching special campaign in this regard. He said the state has also maintained target of zero wastage of vaccine which also needs to be highlighted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shimla/1st-dose-landmark-pm-to-address-people-of-hp-on-sept-6/articleshow/85818041.cms||---
---||Nagpur||147 officers transferred from Nagpur, no replacements||Nagpur: A questionable transfer policy has left the city police in the lurch as 147 officers of different ranks have been transferred while only 25 were added, reducing the strength substantially. The city has 33 police stations with each having at least four chowkies apart from five zonal squads of the crime branch and other specialized units. Nagpur’s former CP PKB Chakravorthy said the state police as well as the government’s step-motherly attitude towards Nagpur police is nothing new. “Apart from a couple of CPs, none wanted to work in Nagpur. If CPs are so reluctant then what can be expected of the lower rank officers,” he said, stating the state public service commission board too should be asked why talented aspirants from Vidarbha fail to get selected in such big numbers as their western Maharashtra counterparts. The posting fiasco has further aggravated a negligible numbers of officers posted in the city. The transferred officers will be released only when the newly-posted ones join. Sources said city police chief Amitesh Kumar has requested higher ups in the state police to allow him to hold back officers till the winter session of the state legislature or until he gets an adequate number of sub-inspectors, assistant inspectors and inspectors to run the commissionerate. It’s learnt that Kumar has also pointed out the fact that the depleted strength of the officers would paralyze routine work, maintenance of law and order and investigations. Kumar refused to divulge information on the transfer issue. “It’s an internal administrative matter,” he told TOI. It’s learnt that the city police had approved 135 inspectors, 172 assistant inspectors and 426 sub-inspectors. Before the transfer order, there were around 129 inspectors, 162 assitant inspectors and 300 sub-inspectors. After the order, 68 sub-inspectors were shifted out while around 25 were moved from the city by the state police headquarters. Only three were posted here. Around 29 assistant inspectors were transferred but seven got posted here. “The officers want to work only in Mumbai, Thane and Pune for reasons best known to them. There’s a rush to avoid Vidarbha,” said an insider. Sources stated that some well-connected officers, using political clout, ensure their postings in Nagpur and elsewhere in Vidarbha is cancelled. “Some officers also approach politicians to put pressure on senior officers to alter their postings, get postings of their choice or even immediate release after being transferred while the ones who wait for their official turn are affected. Not only officers, even their families and children’s education get affected as no schools are willing to admit them mid-session,” said an officer on the condition of anonymity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/147-officers-transferred-from-nagpur-no-replacements/articleshow/85815883.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Chennai||Chennai: O Panneerselvam leads AIADMK walkout over scrapping of Jaya University||CHENNAI: The city police took AIADMK legislators including former chief minister O Panneerselvam into preventive custody on Tuesday after they blocked road in front of Kalaivanar Arangam, where the assembly session is being held, protesting against the government’s decision to scrap Dr J Jayalalithaa University and merge it with Annamalai University. They were taken to a marriage hall on V R Pillai Street, where they were detained. They were released in the evening without a case being registered. A bill in this regard, which was tabled in the house in the morning, was passed in the evening. The AIADMK and the BJP opposed the bill at the introductory stage. The bill, apart from repealing Jayalalithaa varsity, was aimed at amending the Annamalai University Act, 2013 and Bharathidasan University Act, 1981. Now, colleges in Villupuram, Cuddalore, Kallakurichi and Mayiladuthurai districts will come under Annamalai University. As soon as higher education minister K Ponmudi introduced the bill, former minister K P Anbalagan and deputy leader of opposition O Panneerselvam registered their protest saying the government’s decision smacked of political hatred and vendetta. Speaker M Appavu intervened to say that the AIADMK’s objection had been registered in the records and the party could air its views when the bill would be taken up for consideration and passage. Soon, the AIADMK members led by O Panneerselvam walked out. They staged dharna on Wallajah Road. The protest lasted for about 15 minutes, affecting traffic on the road. The DMK government decided to take up the bill for consideration and passage in the afternoon session. The DMK allies, the Congress, VCK, MDMK, MMK, the Left parties and KNMK supported the bill. MMK leader M H Jawahirullah said the previous AIADMK regime had named two universities — fisheries and music and fine arts — after Jayalalithaa and considering the welfare of students, Jayalalithaa varsity in Villupuram should be merged with Annamalai University. BJP floor leader Nainar Nagendran said removing the name of the former CM was not acceptable. Ponmudi said the move to affiliate the colleges to nine-decade-old Annamalai University would provide huge gains to students and parents. “The previous AIADMK regime dropped the name of Kalaignar from insurance and housing schemes, hid his name at Semmozhi Poonga, Anna centenary library, CMBT terminus and the plaque of parks on the Marina front and also dumped television sets presented by the former CM,” he said, adding that a panel set up by the previous regime had recommended that Annamalai University, which was taken over by the AIADMK government from private individuals, should be made affiliating type. The DMK government was giving effect to that, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/chennai-o-panneerselvam-leads-aiadmk-walkout-over-scrapping-of-jaya-university/articleshow/85820852.cms||---

Sawant said that as the issue is in high court, he has started talking to the advocate general and the transport department. “We will come out with a decision on the issue before Ganesh Chaturthi, by taking taxi operators into confidence,” Sawant said, adding that taxi operators are “our brothers”. On Tuesday, taxi operators met Sawant in Chapora and urged him to provide relief in the installation of taxi meters. The operators, who said they haven’t asked their kids to apply for government jobs but to get into the taxi business, stated that they would wait for Sawant’s assurance, and if it isn’t fulfilled, they will decide on a future course of action. “Sawant has assured that there will be relaxation in the fitmets of digital meters and renewal of permits by Ganesh Chaturthi,” Rohidas Naik, who led a delegation to the chief minister, said. Transport minister Mauvin Godinho and ports minister Michael Lobo recently locked horns on the issue. Lobo wanted the government to give free digital meters, and Godinho said that the state is already providing free digital meters, and that Lobo should do his homework before commenting. Taxi operators in Chapora, Vagator, and Anjuna have told Sawant that taxi operators in Goa should be exempted from digital meters or that low-cost meters should be made available in the open market.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/solution-to-digi-meters-issue-by-chaturthi-cm/articleshow/85815988.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Cops set up committee, aim ‘0 suicide’ in Gandhisagar||Nagpur: Ganeshpeth police have formed a suicide prevention committee involving vendors and shopkeepers around Gandhisagar lake to prevent people from ending life in the historic waterbody. The lake, which is around 275 years old and once stretched up to Sitabuldi Tekdi, was the prime source of potable water for Nagpur in the past, but has turned to an unfortunate ‘suicide point’. Last year, 44 people had jumped into the lake to end life, while 22 have committed suicide here this year so far. A woman, who had come to end life along with three daughters last week, was saved for the second time by alert Ganeshpeth police on a day they had rescued three others. Even as suicides in the waterbody remain unabated, NMC has drawn up a Rs34 crore beautification plan and the work has already started. The plan also includes peripheral railings, net inside the lake and other measures to prevent suicides. As per historian Shrikant Sontakke, the lake was dug up by Gond king Chand Sultan (1709-1735) to provide water to the newly formed city of Nagpur, by combining 12 villages then. Later, the Bhosale kings had started using the lake for immersion of Ganesh idols and also for recreational activities like boating and fishing. The lake was partially reclaimed to set up Empress Mills by Jamsetji Tata in 1876 and its water was first used for industrial purposes. Senior inspector of Ganeshpeth police station Bharat Kshirsagar, working under the supervision of zonal DCP Lohit Matani and CP Amitesh Kumar, said he has formed a core team comprising tea stall owners, snacks vendors, puncture repairers, coconut sellers, shopkeepers and others to ensure they act as first responders if someone is spotted moving suspiciously or waiting close to the lake. “A sensitization meeting was also conducted to ensure that locals alert the cops regarding any suspicious person spotted near the lake. Cellphone numbers of senior officers have been shared with the committee members for quick alerts,” said Kshirsagar adding diver Jagdish Khare, who holds a record of sorts of saving hundreds of people from drowning in Gandhisagar, and his wife are constantly keeping the lakeside under surveillance to spot vulnerable citizens contemplating suicide. Kshirsagar said he has requested former district sports officer (DSO) Jaiprakash Dubale, who is also a swimming coach, to train the suicide prevention committee members with a crash course in the skills to save people from drowning. “I have also contacted some psychiatrists and counsellors for their association so that rescued people can be sent for counselling. We have just saved a woman who had twice attempted to end life,” he said. “We are also planning to procure some equipment and put up boards with positive messages,” said the senior PI. BJP corporator Pramod Chikhale said the lake would transform into a spot of tourist attraction leaving behind it’s grim past of being a suicide point. “Apart from beautification, we are trying to ensure no one can end life here by erecting railings, net and other measures. Soon, people would find it a point of regaining sound health and mental peace with the scenic landscape, pathways around the lake, bridge, a light fountain and so on,” said Chikhale.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/cops-set-up-committee-aim-0-suicide-in-gandhisagar/articleshow/85816006.cms||Soumitra Bose

A source close to the development told TOI that if all goes well the South Indian tea estate owner on Wednesday will ink a deal with the Kolkata-based business conglomerate, which owns as many as 17 estates in Assam. The Pauls of Apeejay Surrendra Group, however, remained tight-lipped about the development. A written query sent to the group’s current chairman, Karan Paul, went unanswered till the time the story went to the press. Meanwhile, the tea industry is abuzz with the latest acquisition deal involving Apeejay Group, one of the oldest tea majors in India. “There is a strong rumour that the controlling interest in Apeejay Tea is changing hands on Wednesday and the new buyer is somebody connected to the Paul family. Reportedly, the south Indian group has a business link in the UK,” said a tea industry insider, who has been following the development. A top tea exporter in the city, however, termed this news as a rumour, but confirmed that the group has been trying to offload the burden of its tea business. Apeejay has exited the loss-making UK business of Typhoo by selling its stake to a group of private equity (PE) players in order to stop a series of fresh infusion of funds that was required to revive the 120-year-old tea brand. The group had bought Typhoo from Premier Foods for £80 million in 2005. However, the licence to sell teas under the Typhoo brand in India remains with Apeejay. Founded in 1910 in Jalandhar, the Apeejay Surrendra Group is one of India’s oldest business conglomerates having an employee count of 43,000. The group's business interests range from plantations to tea brands and cafes. During the last two decades or so, Indian tea producers have been plagued by low price realisation, high cost of production, climatic change, ageing bushes, political unrest, paucity of skilled labour, infrastructural bottlenecks and illegal influx of cheaper tea from Nepal. The Covid-19 lockdown has added to the wounds by reducing crop output by over 15% in the peak quality period of March to June. One of the top tea producers based in Kolkata feels only a very serious tea player with a proper management in place would buy a tea estate amid this situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/apeejay-tea-likely-to-sell-controlling-pie-to-s-indian-co/articleshow/85816294.cms||Sovon Manna
---||Goa||‘Delay in arrest due to political connect’||Panaji: Porvorim MLA Rohan Khaunte on Monday alleged that Goa police was delaying in arresting the main accused in the doctor assault case as he was related to certain BJP leaders. He also accused the Porvorim PI of working on instructions of chief minister Pramod Sawant. “(If) a person goes untraceable and Goa police has not been able to arrest him in the last five days, he may be a relative of a Union minister (or) a nephew of a big BJP karyakarta. Why are BJP mandals not out on the street demanding justice? Not a single (such) person is seen,” Khaunte said. Khaunte met North Goa SP Shobhit Saxena at the North Goa police headquarters to discuss the case. The Porvorim MLA also said that they would decide the future course of action if justice is not given to the family of the doctor within 24 hours. The doctor operates from Porvorim. Khaunte said that law and order is applicable to everybody. “If there is no action against the main accused, the people of Porvorim will not keep quiet,” he said. The independent legislator added that during Covid times, the security of doctors is important. On Monday, around 100 Indian Medical Association (IMA)-Goa doctors had protested at the Porvorim police station, warning of a tools-down protest if the main accused wasn’t arrested within 24 hours. Khaunte said it was unfortunate that doctors had to go to the police station for justice. He also said that when doctors visited the police station, cops immediately arrested three persons. “That means the police knew everything,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/delay-in-arrest-due-to-political-connect/articleshow/85816061.cms||---
---||Goa||Coding, robotics edu begin for 20k Class VI-VIII kids||Panaji: Around 400 government and aided high schools in the state have begun introducing the new coding and robotics programme for close to 20,000 students from Class VI to VIII. Approximately 540 school computer teachers across the state are involved in teaching the programme. It is the first robotics syllabus to be formally taught in schools in any state in the country. The syllabus is also unique because it has not been designed and imposed on the teachers to be taught, but has been framed by a team of school computer teachers themselves. The syllabus is based on a broad guideline provided by a panel of the State Council for Education Research and Training (SCERT). A teacher said that the new programme is not only about teaching students coding and robotics, but using information and communication technology (ICT) education as a tool to improve their understanding of other subjects. The entire ICT syllabus for Classes VI to VIII has been revamped and students spend a minimum of one hour a week learning the new course for now. Project director for ‘Chief minister’s coding and robotics education in schools scheme’ or CM-CARES, Vijay Borges said that the state is in the process of floating tenders to upgrade computer labs in schools for the scheme at a cost of around Rs16 crore. “In the first year only for the year 2021 as the scheme is being introduced for the first time, the Class VI syllabus will be introduced to students in Class VI, VII and VIII. During the next academic year the 2021-22 Class VI batch will enter Class VII and learn the advanced syllabus designed for Class VII. Similarly the students from Class VII in 2021-22 will progress to the syllabus of Class VIII during the next academic year. This is to ensure phased implementation,” said Borges. The teachers have also prepared evaluation rubrics (scoring tool) so that students can be assessed not by allotting marks, but by noting the skill-sets that they have acquired through the programme. “The aim is not to make all students coders and get them into robotics. It is about using coding and robotics as a tool to augment learning of other subjects. We also have a learning management system which allows us to monitor implementation of the programme in all schools, including remote ones. Also we have used all open source tools for the programme without acquiring them at a cost,” said Borges. A teacher at Progress High School, Panaji, Maya Kamat said that she is amazed by the enthusiastic response from students. “In the earlier syllabus for computer education we used to teach them applications like Paint, Note. Now they are learning games which improve their understanding of other subjects like English, Science. I can see the confidence in the children going up. I am surprised how I take them through the concept just once and they are going beyond,” said Kamat. The entire module comprises of 35 lesson plans of which teachers have been trained at present to teach 20. The scheme will be implemented in a phased manner over five years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/coding-robotics-edu-begin-for-20k-class-vi-viii-kids/articleshow/85816210.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar
