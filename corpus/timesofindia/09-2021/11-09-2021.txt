In a statement for the Ethiopian New Year on Saturday, Biden said the United States was "deeply concerned" by the violence and was committed to help both through diplomatic efforts and humanitarian aid.  "We believe Ethiopia, a great and diverse nation, can overcome its current divisions and resolve the ongoing conflict, beginning with a negotiated ceasefire," Biden said in a statement.  "Building peace will not be easy, but it can and must begin now with dialogue and by seeking unity in our common humanity," he said.  In the latest mass killing, doctors and local officials told AFP that at least 125 villagers were massacred earlier this month in the Amhara region.  "We condemn all such abuses against civilians in the strongest possible terms and call on all parties to the conflict to respect human rights and comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law," State Department spokesman Ned Price said of the attack.  The Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) denied allegations that its fighters were to blame for the latest attack.  The State Department did not assign blame but pointed to abuses by the TPLF as well as national troops from Ethiopia and neighboring Eritrea and forces from the Amhara region.  Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, a Nobel laureate who had enjoyed close relations with Washington, launched a military offensive in November against the TPLF, then the region's ruling party, in response to its attacks on army camps.  The ongoing violence has sparked a humanitarian crisis with aid workers struggling to enter and the United Nations warning that 400,000 people face famine.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-urges-peace-in-ethiopia-as-us-condemns-massacre/articleshow/86101189.cms||---
---||World||US: Afghan evacuee flights halted from two key bases||WASHINGTON: The United States has halted all US-bound flights of Afghan evacuees from two main bases overseas for unspecified "health safety concerns", a move officials warn will have a severe impact on the evacuation operation, according to a government document seen Friday by The Associated Press. The US Customs and Border Protection made the decision on the recommendation of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to halt the flights from the US bases in Germany and Qatar, according to the document. The US has been conducting screening and other processing of evacuees at those two main overseas sites and others after evacuating them from Afghanistan. The halting of the flights is a problem for the United States in part because many of the evacuees already have been at the Ramstein military base longer than the 10-day limit Germany set in allowing the US to use the country as a transit site. The US document viewed by the AP said the halt would "severely impact" operations at the US base in Germany and have an "adverse effect" on the nearly 10,000 evacuees at Ramstein, many of whom have been there more than 10 days and are increasingly fatigued. The US State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-afghan-evacuee-flights-halted-from-two-key-bases/articleshow/86101233.cms||---

"China will import more distinctive products from Asean, expand mutual investment, deepen the industrial supply chain and promote Lancang-Mekong cooperation," Chinese vice-president Wang Qishan said, referring to the economic corridor with Southeast Asia. He was speaking at the China-Asean Business and Investment Summit in Nanning city.

This is the first time that China has established a direct link to the Indian Ocean through Myanmar. For India, the rail and road linkage through Myanmar is both a strategic and a trade challenge. Trains make it easy to transport extremely heavy military equipment. The new link connects China to Myanmar’s Yangon port and gives it easy access to the market in Southeast Asia. The first cargo train brought goods from Singapore to Yangon port. Speaking at the event, Myanmar minister of commerce Pwint San said, "I would like to request China and our Asean friends to work with us to revitalise the economy of the region." He emphasised the need to further "liberalise the non-tariff barriers on goods that are essential to facilitate and boost our trade".

Gandhi, addressing Congress flag-waving party workers on his second visit to Jammu and Kashmir since the abrogation of Article 370, said he would "also go to Ladakh in the coming days". "I am happy to come to this pradesh (state) as I feel at home here as my family has a long relationship with this state, which now is a Union Territory… I will speak later on this…" He said BJP and RSS efforts to destroy the copyist culture of J&K "makes you weak". "Earlier there was a flourishing trade, economy and tourism, which now have declined, making you weak," he added. He recalled his visit to temples in the state. Rahul said the goddess Durga is the power that protects (durg, or fortress), the goddess Laxmi has power to achieve aims and the goddess Saraswati is the power of knowledge. "And when these three deities are in a house or in a nation, they flourish." Targeting BJP, Gandhi alleged that the policies of the BJP-led central government, including the introduction of demonetisation and GST, decreased the power of Goddess Laxmi in the country. On farmer issues, he asked, "Joh kisano ke naye kanoon aa rahe hain unme Durga Mata ki shakti badhi ki ghati (Have the new farm laws increased or decreased the strength of the nation)?" "When a person from RSS or BJP is appointed in all educational institutions, then the power of Goddess Saraswati decreases," Rahul said. When he asked whether the power of Ma Saraswato increased r decreased when someone from BJP or RSS was appointed as the head of an educational institution, the crowd replied "Ghati (it decreases)". Referring to the bifurcation of J&K, he said, "What did they (BJP) do with you ( people of J&K)? First, they invaded your composite culture... then attacked your harmony and weakened you.. and then snatched your statehood." He said the people of J&K must ask BJP why they have destroyed its economy. BJP is creating fear among people, he said, adding, "Congress pyaar hai jabki BJP dar hai (Congress is love, BJP is fear)." "I am a Kashmiri pandit and I will help Kashmiri pandits," he said. Exhorting party workers, the Congress leader said, "Congress workers are the real power and they must understand their power… Congress has the potential to cross 450 seats in the Lok Sabha." Earlier, senior Congress politician Ghulam Nabi Azad had criticised the government’s claims about J&K’s development. "The Darbar Move practice was scrapped and it has badly hit the economy of Jammu, unemployment has increased and the tourism sector is facing a huge setback. People are not getting basic amenities like water and electricity," Azad said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bjp-rss-weakening-breaking-jks-composite-culture-rahul-gandhi/articleshow/86101345.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

---||World||Taliban ‘execute’ Amrullah Saleh’s brother after his arrest||ISLAMABAD: Ruhullah Azizi, the elder brother of former Afghanistan vice-president Amrullah Saleh, has been reportedly "executed" by the Taliban in the restive Panjshir valley, north of Kabul. The news of Azizi’s death was first reported by Aamaj News, a Dari language website, in a post on Twitter. It stated that Saleh’s brother, a commander of the resistance force, was killed in Panjshir’s Rokha district. Quoting a local source, the website reported that he was captured by the Taliban and shot dead on Thursday night. His death was later confirmed by his nephew from Panjshir, the website said. Zahra Rahimi, an Afghan journalist, tweeted that Azizi was killed by the Taliban after being detained by the group while attempting to flee Panjshir. According to Reuters, Saleh’s nephew said Azizi had been executed. Following the fall of Kabul last month and the escape of ex-president Ashraf Ghani from the country, Saleh went to the Panjshir valley, the only province not captured by the Taliban then, and proclaimed himself the caretaker president of Afghanistan as per the constitution. He had announced the formation of an anti-Taliban front, along with Ahmad Massoud, the son of slain Afghan warlord Ahmad Shah Massoud, and former defence minister Bismillah Khan Mohammadi. Saleh has been a powerful political figure in Afghanistan and has survived numerous assassination attempts. He is known as an outspoken critic of the Taliban and Pakistan. Last week he had rejected media reports that he had fled to Tajikistan and showed his presence in Panjshir in a video posted on Twitter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/taliban-execute-amrullah-salehs-brother-after-his-arrest/articleshow/86101467.cms||Omer Farooq Khan

---||World||Pakistan expanding its nuke arsenal: Report||MUMBAI: Pakistan continues to expand its nuclear arsenal with more warheads, more delivery systems and a growing fissile materials production industry, according to a report in the US-based ‘Bulletin Of The Atomic Scientists’ dated September 9. The Bulletin was started in 1945 by scientists who were part of the ‘Manhattan Project’, which designed and developed the world’s first atomic bomb. According to the Bulletin, Pakistan’s stockpile could grow to around 200 warheads by 2025, if the current trend continues. “Pakistan is clearly engaged in a significant build-up of its nuclear forces and has been for some time,” says the journal, adding that Pakistan now has a nuclear weapons stockpile of approximately 165 warheads. Quoting a study in early 2021, it states that Pakistan could have produced 690 grams of tritium by the end of 2020, sufficient to boost over 100 weapons. The report has emphasised that Pakistan’s expansion of nuclear weapons will largely depend upon India strengthening its nuclear weapons programme. Analysis of a large number of commercial satellite images of Pakistani army garrisons and air force bases shows what appear to be launchers and facilities that might be related to the nuclear forces. “With several new delivery systems in development, four plutonium production reactors and an expanding uranium enrichment infrastructure, however, Pakistan’s stockpile has the potential to increase further over the next 10 years,” the Bulletin report says. The Bulletin quotes former Pakistani officials saying that this particular emphasis on non-strategic nuclear weapons is specifically intended as a reaction to India’s perceived “Cold Start” doctrine which “revolves around India maintaining the capability to launch large-scale conventional strikes or incursions against Pakistani territory below the threshold at which Pakistan would retaliate with nuclear weapons”. According to the Bulletin, Pakistan has a well-established and diverse fissile material production complex that is expanding. It includes the Kahuta uranium enrichment plant east of Islamabad, which appears to be growing with the near completion of what could be another enrichment plant, as well as the enrichment plant at Gadwal to the north of the capital city. Four heavy-water plutonium production reactors appear to have been completed at what is normally referred to as the Khushab Complex, some 33km (20 miles) south of Khushab in Punjab province. Three of the reactors at the complex have been added in the past 10 years. The New Labs Reprocessing Plant at Nilore, east of Islamabad, which reprocesses spent fuel and extracts plutonium, has been expanded. A second reprocessing plant located at Chashma in the north-western part of Punjab province may have been completed and become operational by 2015. A significant expansion to the Chashma complex was under construction between 2018 and 2020, according to the report. Nuclear-capable missiles and their mobile launchers are developed and produced at the National Defence Complex (sometimes called the National Development Complex) located in the Kala Chitta Dahr mountain range west of Islamabad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/pakistan/pakistan-expanding-its-nuke-arsenal-report/articleshow/86101565.cms||Srinivas Laxman

---||World||Now president, Biden to mark 9/11 rite amid new terror fear||NEW YORK: He will again make the ritual journey to sacred American landmarks of loss. He will once more bow his head in silent prayer. He will repeat words of comfort for those whose lives changed forever on that brilliant September day two decades ago. But this time, Joe Biden will hold the rank of commander in chief as he marks the anniversary of the nation's worst terror attack. Now, he shoulders the responsibility borne by previous presidents to prevent future tragedy, and must do so against fresh fears of a rise in terror after the United States' exit from the country, from which the September 11th attacks were launched. This 9/11 comes little more than two weeks after a suicide bomber in Kabul killed 13 US service members as the military concluded its withdrawal from Afghanistan. And as Afghanistan returns to Taliban rule, there are fresh concerns that the country could again be a launching pad for attacks that Biden's government will be charged with preventing. But for Biden, like his predecessors, the 9/11 anniversary can also present an opportunity to try to reclaim the sense of national unity that followed the attacks, a spirt long since faded amid the country's divisive politics. "For Biden, it's a moment for people to see him not as Democratic President, but as President of the United States of America," said Robert Gibbs who served as President Barack Obama's press secretary. "The American people are somewhat conflicted about what they have seen out of Afghanistan the last couple of weeks," Gibbs said. "For Biden, it's a moment to try to reset some of that. Remind people of what it is to be commander in chief and what it means to be the leader of the country at a moment of such significance." The president will commemorate the solemn anniversary on Saturday by paying his respects at the trio of sites where the hijacked planes struck, puncturing the United States' air of invincibility and resulting in the deaths of 3,000 Americans. First will be a stop in New York City, where the twin towers of the World Trade Center were toppled as a horrified world watched on television. Then, a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, where a plane fell from the sky after heroic passengers fought terrorists to prevent it from reaching its Washington destination. And finally, the Pentagon, where the world's mightiest military suffered an unthinkable blow to its very home. Biden's task, like his predecessors before him, will be mark the moment with a mix of grief and resolve. A man who has suffered immense personal tragedy, Biden speaks of loss with power and eloquence, and he has repeatedly addressed the grief caused by the COVID-19 pandemic that has claimed more than 600,000 lives across the country. While the ceremonies on Saturday don't call for him to make public remarks, the White House said Biden would release a videotaped message. "We all remember distinctly that day and how much it's impacted us and has impacted us for the last several decades," White House press secretary Jen Psaki said this week. "That's true for him as well." Afghanistan will shadow the day. Osama Bin Laden used that nation to mastermind the 2001 attacks, ushering in an expanded era of terror attacks on soft targets - hotels, office buildings, nightclubs - in cities across the West. Al-qaeda was routed from Afghanistan in the months after September 11. But other groups have taken up the cause, including the Islamic State group in Afghanistan, believed to be responsible for the Kabul attack last month. Biden has long argued that the United States' military mission in Afghanistan was over, that the US needed to stop allowing its soldiers to die there. But for some, the return of the Taliban to power, and the terror threat it could produce, has made the 20th anniversary a bitter and worrisome one. Biden will be the fourth president to console the nation on the anniversary of that dark day, one that has shaped many of the most consequential domestic and foreign policy decisions made by the chief executives over the past two decades. The terror attack defined the presidency of George W. Bush, who was reading a book to Florida schoolchildren when the planes slammed into the World Trade Center. He spent that day being kept out of Washington for security reasons - a decision that then-Senator Biden urged him to reconsider, the current president has written - and then delivered a brief, halting speech that night from the White House to a terrified nation. The following year, Bush chose Ellis Island as the location to deliver his first anniversary address, the Statue of Liberty over his shoulder as he vowed: "What our enemies have begun, we will finish." "In the ruins of two towers, under a flag unfurled at the Pentagon, at the funerals of the lost, we have made a sacred promise to ourselves and to the world: We will not relent until justice is done and our nation is secure," Bush said. At that time, the nation had been on war footing for months, one conflict raging in Afghanistan and another looming in Iraq. America's "war on terror" reshaped its citizens' daily lives and expanded the powers of its government as it sought, at times on shaky legal grounds, to prevent further attacks. "One year after, it still felt like it was immediately after the attack, the nation was still gripped by its consequences," said Ari Fleischer, Bush's press secretary. He said that all presidents must offer messages of "comfort and reassurance" but also strength. "There are lessons to be learned because there are terrorists who would love to create a September 12th if the U.S. ever lets down its guard," said Fleischer. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were still deadly when President Barack Obama visited the Pentagon to mark his first September 11th in office in 2009. "No words can ease the ache of your hearts," said Obama. "We recall the beauty and meaning of their lives," he said. "No passage of time, no dark skies can dull the meaning of that moment." By the time Obama spoke at the 10th anniversary, bin Laden was dead, killed in a May 2011 Navy Seal raid. Though the nation remained entangled overseas, and vigilant against terror threats, the anniversary became more about healing, as a stunning memorial and soaring skyscrapers rose at Ground Zero, symbols of remembrance and rebirth at what had once been a pile of twisted steel and terrible anguish. President Donald Trump pledged to get the US out of Afghanistan, but his words during his first September 11th anniversary ceremony in 2017 were a vivid warning to terrorists, telling "these savage killers that there is no dark corner beyond our reach, no sanctuary beyond our grasp, and nowhere to hide anywhere on this very large earth." On Saturday, as Biden visits all three sites, Bush will pay his respects in Shanksville while Obama will do the same in New York. Trump, meanwhile, will be delivering ringside commentary at a boxing match at a casino in Hollywood, Florida.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/now-president-biden-to-mark-9/11-rite-amid-new-terror-fear/articleshow/86102081.cms||---

It has, however, slowed down significantly from the 20.8% estimated during April-June last year, when the impact of the national lockdown was at its peak, and 13.2% in the July-September quarter. The pandemic had led to huge job losses during the lockdown last year. Since the opening up of the economy after the second wave early this year, the jobs situation has shown some improvement. “The latest PLFS (Periodic Labour Force Survey) for Q3FY21 reveals a steady improvement in the labour market, with the unemployment rate slowing to 10.3% according to the current weekly status. This is more than half of Q1FY21 unemployment rate when the economy was in complete lockdown,” said Soumya Kanti Ghosh, group chief economic advisor at State Bank of India. “The labour force participation rate, however, increased only marginally and still remains a matter of concern,” he added. The unemployment rate for females was higher at 13.1% during the October-December quarter compared to 9.5% for males. The unemployment rate during the year-ago quarter was 9.8% for females and 7.3% for males, according to the PLFS quarterly bulletin released by the National Statistical Office (NSO). Youth unemployment rate (15-29 years) during the three months to December was at 24.9%, lower than 27.7% in the previous quarter and higher than 19.2% a year ago. Jammu & Kashmir had the highest unemployment rate of 17.8% during the period, followed by Kerala at 16.7% and Jharkhand at 16%. Gujarat had the lowest unemployment rate among states at 4%, slower than 4.5% in the previous quarter. Twelve states recorded double-digit unemployment rates during this period, compared with 22 states in the April-June quarter of 2020. Eight states had recorded double-digit unemployment in the October-December quarter of 2019-20. The finance ministry has recently asked the statistics ministry to put in place a quarterly employment data mechanism, which should be released with a month’s lag to help in policymaking. Currently, the quarterly jobs data comes with a lag of around 45 days under the PLFS. It was started in 2017 to give a better picture of the employment scenario. But this, too, is considered inadequate as the time lag creates roadblocks. The PLFS was launched by the NSO to estimate the employment and unemployment indicators (worker-population ratio, labour force participation rate and unemployment rate) in the short-time interval of three months for urban areas only in the current weekly status. Under CWS, a person is considered as unemployed in a week if he/she did not work even for one hour on any day during the reference week, but sought or was available for work at least for one hour on any day during the reference week, according to the PLFS. The annual PLFS report covers both rural and urban areas whereas the quarterly bulletin is for urban centres.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/urban-unemployment-rate-in-10-3-in-october-december-fy21-survey/articleshow/86101828.cms||---
---||Business||Household debt is Rs 60,000 in villages, Rs 1.2 lakh in cities: NSO||NEW DELHI: The average rural household had a debt of just under Rs 60,000 while its urban counterpart had a debt of Rs 1.2 lakh. On the flip side, 35% of rural households were indebted compared to 22% in urban centres, a survey released by the National Statistical office (NSO) on Friday showed. In rural areas, the average debt was Rs 74,460 for cultivator households and Rs 40,432 for non-cultivator households. In urban areas, it was Rs 1.8 lakh for self-employed households and Rs 99,353 for other households, the survey showed. In rural India, 66% of the outstanding cash debt was from institutional credit agencies, but 34% was from non-institutional credit agencies. In urban areas, non-institutional lenders accounted for just 13% of the outstanding cash debt while 87% was from institutional credit agencies. The average value of assets held by cultivator families in rural areas was Rs 22 lakh and for non-cultivators it was about a third at Rs 7.8 lakh. In urban areas, the average value of assets for self-employed households at Rs 41.5 lakh was almost twice as much as the average of Rs 22.1 lakh for other households. The NSO’s All India Debt & Investment Survey was conducted during the period January-December, 2019 as a part of the 77th round of the National Sample Survey (NSS). The main objective of the survey was to collect quantitative information on assets and liabilities of households as on June, 30 2018. About 84.4% of the population 18 years and above had a deposit account in banks in rural India (88.1% male and 80.7% female) not very different from the 85.2% in urban areas (89.0% male and 81.3% female). SCs had the lowest average value of assets at Rs 8.7 lakh in rural areas and Rs 13.2 lakh in urban areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/household-debt-is-rs-60000-in-villages-rs-1-2-lakh-in-cities-nso/articleshow/86102105.cms||---
---||World||US decision on Pfizer Covid-19 shot for kids age 5-11 could come in October: Sources||Top United States health officials believe that Pfizer Inc's Covid-19 vaccine could be authorised for children aged 5-11 years old by the end of October, two sources familiar with the situation said on Friday.  The timeline is based on the expectation that Pfizer, which developed the shot with Germany's BioNTech, will have enough data from clinical trials to seek emergency use authorization (EUA) for that age group from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) towards the end of this month, the sources said.  They anticipate the FDA could make a decision on whether the shot is safe and effective in younger children within three weeks of the EUA submission.  Top US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci outlined the timetable during an online town hall meeting attended by thousands of staff at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) on Friday, according to one of the sources. A second source familiar with the situation said that the FDA anticipated a similar timeline for Pfizer.  If Pfizer submits its EUA by the end of September, and the data support its use, "by the time we get to October, the first couple of weeks... the Pfizer product will likely be ready," Fauci said, according to the source. Fauci said that Moderna Inc will likely take about three weeks longer than Pfizer to collect and analyze its data on children age 5-11, according to the source. He estimated that a decision on the Moderna shot could come around November, according to the source. The second source said Fauci's timeline for Moderna appeared "optimistic."  NIH officials did not immediately comment on the Fauci remarks.  Pfizer has said that it would have data on children age 5-11 ready in September and planned to submit for an EUA shortly after. Previously, federal health regulators, including Fauci, have suggested that an FDA decision might come in November or later. Moderna on Thursday told investors it expected data from its children's study by the end of the year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-decision-on-pfizer-covid-19-shot-for-kids-age-5-11-could-come-in-october-sources/articleshow/86102376.cms||---

The crash, which took place overnight Thursday to Friday, involved a Mi-24 helicopter, the army said.  The helicopter had been on a "reconnaissance mission on the northern border" with Burkina Faso, near Togolokaye, a statement said, adding that all five on board had died.  The cause of the accident was not yet known and an investigation was launched.  The army in northern Ivory Coast has faced several attacks by suspected jihadists, especially on the border with Burkina Faso.  Last June, two soldiers and a gendarme died in the Togolokaye region, after having run over an explosive device.  Fourteen soldiers were killed in June 2020 in an attack at Kafolo and in the same locality, three other soldiers were killed last March.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/army-helicopter-crash-kills-five-in-ivory-coast/articleshow/86102432.cms||---

On his visit, Kerry will meet with his counterparts in the Indian government and private sector leaders, the department said in a statement.  Kerry is laying groundwork for the US participation in the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, or COP26, which will be held in Glasgow from October 31-November 12. He traveled last week to Japan and China for talks with officials.  In April, Kerry spoke with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi about how the United States could help mobilise finance to reduce risks in producing alternative energy in the fight against global warming.  India is the world's third biggest emitter of greenhouse gases after China and the United States, albeit with far lower emissions per capita than those countries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-climate-envoy-kerry-will-travel-to-india-on-sunday/articleshow/86102470.cms||---
---||World||US gives 1st public look inside base housing Afghans||FORT BLISS: The Biden administration on Friday provided the first public look inside a United States military base where Afghans airlifted out of Afghanistan are being screened, amid questions about how the government is caring for the refugees and vetting them.  "Every Afghan who is here with us has endured a harrowing journey and they are now faced with the very real challenges of acclimating with life in the United States," Liz Gracon, a senior State Department official, told reporters.  The three-hour tour at Fort Bliss Army base in El Paso, Texas, was the first time the media has been granted broad access to one of the eight US military installations housing Afghans.  But even so, reporters, including those with The Associated Press, were not allowed to talk with any evacuees or spend more than a few minutes in areas where they were gathered, with military officials citing "privacy concerns".  Nearly 10,000 Afghan evacuees are staying at the base while they undergo medical and security checks before being resettled in the United States. The operation was described by officials at the Department of Homeland Security and Department of State as a "historic" and "unprecedented" effort to facilitate the relocation of a huge number of refugees in less than a month's time.  On Friday, Afghan children with soccer balls and basketballs played outside large white tents. Families walked down a dirt driveway with stacks of plastic food containers piled under their chins and soft drink cans under their arms. One young girl, still wearing dirty clothing, cried in the middle of the road after her food spilled and soldiers attempted to help her. Inside the containers, which refugees had spent around 15 minutes in line in the blistering sun, were traditional Afghan meals of basmati rice and hearty stew.  The US government spent two weeks building what it calls a village to house the Afghans on the base. It is a sprawling area with hundreds of air-conditioned tents used as dormitories and dining halls on scrubby dirt lots, a landscape that in some ways resembled parts of the homeland they fled. The base was previously used to hold migrant children in 2016.  Under the programme called "Operation Allies Welcome", some 50,000 Afghans are expected to be admitted to the United States, including translators, drivers and others who helped the US military during the 20-year war and who feared reprisals by the Taliban after they quickly seized power last month.  Nearly 130,000 were airlifted out of Afghanistan in one of the largest mass evacuations in the US history. Many of those people are still in transit, undergoing security vetting and screening in other countries, including Germany, Spain, Kuwait and Qatar.  Members of Congress have questioned whether the screening is thorough enough. Many of the Afghans who worked for the US government have undergone years of vetting already before they were hired, and then again to apply for a special immigrant visa for the US allies.  After they are released from the base, they will be aided by resettlement agencies in charge of placing the refugees. The agencies give priority to places where the refugees either have family already in the United States or there are Afghan immigrant communities with the resources to help them start a new life in a foreign land. Those with American citizenship or green cards are able to leave once arriving at the base, according to a State Department representative.  If other evacuees - whose release is dependent on completing health protocols mandated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - choose to leave prior to the full resettlement period, that may be used against them.  So far, no one at Fort Bliss has been released for resettlement.  The Pentagon has said all evacuees are tested for the Covid-19 upon arriving at Dulles International Airport outside Washington.  The Biden administration is also using the base to house thousands of immigrant children, mostly from Central America, who have been crossing the US-Mexico border in record numbers on their own, without adults. The children are housed there until they can be reunited with relatives already in the United States or with a sponsor, usually a family friend, or sent to a licensed facility.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-gives-1st-public-look-inside-base-housing-afghans/articleshow/86102536.cms||---

---||Kolkata||In first 8 days of September, West Bengal inoculates over 40 lakh||KOLKATA: The vaccinating pace is picking up a reasonably good speed in Bengal. More than 40 lakh doses have been administered in the first eight days of September. With regular supply of vaccine, health officials are hopeful of keeping up the inoculation momentum. In the past eight days, the state has been administering 5 lakh-plus doses per day. With close to 13 lakh doses being administered in a single day on the last day of August, the cumulative vaccination for the month clocked 1.2-crore plus doses. The August 31 inoculation drive has been the single day highest performance in Bengal so far. Even as such a feat has not been achieved after that, there have been days when six to seven lakh doses have been administered. “Currently, we are administering above 5 lakh doses a day. Even if we target between five lakh and six lakh doses per day, September performance will be much better than that of August. It, however, will depend on how regular the supply is and the quantity,” said a senior health official. On Thursday, when the drive began for the day, the state had 33.6 lakh doses in its possession. Officials said given this stock, it will not be difficult to vaccinate five to six lakh persons a day. Bengal has been assured of around 1.3 crore-plus doses for September. “So far, we have got 42.5 lakh doses for September. We should be getting about 90 lakh more this month. The next consignment of 10 lakh is expected to arrive on Sunday,” said Ashim Das Malakar, state family welfare officer. Till reports came in last on Thursday, a cumulative of 4.6 crore-plus doses have been administered across the state, of which 3.3 crore-plus was the first doses, bringing it close to 50% of the eligible population having got at least one dose of the vaccine. “It is good that the inoculation drive is gaining momentum. If we keep administering 5-6 lakh doses daily by mid-November, we would have the eligible adult population in the state covered by at least one dose,” said IPGMER surgery professor Diptendra Sarkar. In Kolkata, 62 lakh-plus jabs have been administered, of which 43 lakh-plus doses are first dose. Therefore, sources said, about 95% of Kolkatans have got at least the first jab. “In comparison to serpentine queues in front of government CVCs, the private ones are mostly empty. We can escalate inoculation drive further if we find out ways so that private CVCs too could go back to vaccinating at the pace they were doing before,” said a senior Swasthya Bhawan official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/in-first-8-days-of-sept-state-inoculates-over-40l/articleshow/86100553.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

It is further been found that just 0.4% of the agricultural households possess land above 10 hectare. In contrast, of the total non-agricultural households, which forms 46% of the total rural households, those possessing land less than 1 ha is almost 99%. The survey, carried out by national statistical office for the year 2019, has found that nearly 77% of the agricultural households are self-employed, with 69% into crop production. The remaining households which are into employment include 7.7% as into regular salaried work while a high 14% is into casual labour. Among the non-agricultural households, 48.6% are into casual labour while nearly 18% are into regular salaried work. Importantly, it has been found that 8.2% of rural households are landless — the category defined as owning less than 0.002 ha of land. The social group-wise landholding in rural areas makes an important finding. The scheduled castes own 10.2% of rural land while the scheduled tribes own 14.1% of total land. In contrast, the “other backward classes” own 47% of the land and “The others” own 28.5% of the land. The SCs account for nearly 16% of agricultural households while scheduled tribes are 14% and OBCs are nearly 46%. The data on ownership of livestock makes for interesting reading. As many as 48.5% households own “cattle” while 27.8% own buffalo. As many as 10.7% own poultry birds while 21.9% own bovine and other mammals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/70-of-agricultural-households-possess-land-less-than-1-hectare-finds-survey/articleshow/86102412.cms||---

A decision to this effect was taken at a meeting of academics and PU officials held on Friday under the chairmanship of vice-chancellor (VC), Girish Kumar Chaudhary. It was decided to start necessary preparations for the implementation of CBCS without any further delay. The VC constituted a six-member committee headed by applied economics and commerce department senior faculty member, N K Jha, to formulate admission ordinance and examination regulations for the UG courses under CBCS pattern in the light of UGC guidelines. Other members of the committee are Shankar Kumar (physics), Rakesh Ranjan (political science), Siddharth Bhardwaj (economics), Shekhar (geology), and Shobhan Chakraborty (English). The professor-in-charge of PU information technology cell will provide all technical assistance to this committee. PU students’ welfare dean, Anil Kumar, said the ordinance and regulations drafted by this committee would be placed before the academic council and syndicate of the university for their approval. “They will then be sent to the Raj Bhavan for the governor’s approval. If the regulations are okayed by him, PU will become the first university in the state to introduce CBCS and semester system at the UG level,” he added. A detailed discussion on revising the syllabi of UG and PG courses under CBCS was held at a high-level meeting at the Raj Bhavan on Thursday and the VCs of all the universities decided to get their syllabi revised with a view to making them socially relevant. In 2019, the chancellor’s secretariat had announced that the CBCS would be introduced at the UG stage in all the colleges from the next session (2020-2021) and even started framing uniform ordinance and regulations. It had also initiated steps for getting the syllabi of UG courses revised as per the CBCS. But the same did not materialize due to the Covid-19 pandemic. PU had implemented CBCS at the PG stage from the session 2018-2019, but it could not implement the same at the UG level as most colleges were not prepared for it. However, some self-financing (vocational) courses of PU running in different colleges have already introduced CBCS from 2019-2020 session.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/pu-set-to-introduce-cbcs-at-ug-level-from-next-session/articleshow/86100410.cms||B K Mishra

On the first day of Ganesh Chaturthi on Friday, priest Prashant Jahagirdar exclusively came from Sangli, Maharashtra to do the rituals in the city. The programme at Maharashtra Mandal on Daroga Rai Path started with the installation of Lord Ganesha’s idol amid the chanting of mantras. It was followed by the ceremonial adoration of Ganesha by dedicating flowers, blowing a conch shell and the usual Ganesh ‘vandana’. “I am blessed to get a chance to lead the ‘aarti’ and ‘vandana’ of Lord Ganesha this time. The festival provides us a sense of purity,” said Mallikarjun Shivmurti, a member of Maharashtra Mandal. “The turnout of devotees was poor on Day 1 due to Covid fears. It is expected that the number of visitors will increase over the next two-three days. All protocols are being followed to keep Covid at bay,” he said, adding Union minister of state for health Ashwini Kumar Choubey also joined the festivities in the evening. The 10-day festival will be a five-day affair this time. “A ‘pagdi (turban)’ will be tied to Lord Ganesha soon and Haldi Kumkum ceremony will take place accordingly,” Shivmurti said. The pandal at Maharashtra Mandal has been decorated with colour and fragrance. Different kinds of sweets were offered to Ganesha on Friday. Special artisans have come from Kolkata for the purpose.

In a statement, Paras said he would have attended his political mentor’s ‘barsi’ even if his estranged nephew and Jamui MP Chirag Paswan had not invited him. “It's a function being organised by the members of our own family,” he said. Paras said Chirag had visited him in Delhi with an invitation card for the function. “It is Chirag’s right as the son to observe ‘barsi’ of his father,” he said. The minister, however, said the first death anniversary of Ram Vilas would be observed in a bigger way. “I will personally invite Chirag and his family members to a function to be held on October 8,” Paras added. “I am a Union minister today because of him (Ram Vilas),” the Hajipur MP said. Earlier, Chirag had called on RJD chief Lalu Prasad in Delhi and his younger son Tejashwi Prasad Yadav in Patna to invite them to the September 12 event. He, however, couldn’t get an appointment with CM Nitish Kumar to invite him to the function. “Waise bhi mukhyamantri ji mujhse kam hin milna chahte hain. Lekin function se pahle phir se milne ka prayas karunga (CM doesn’t want to meet me. But I will again try to meet him and invite him to the function),” Chirag said.

The total number of dengue cases in the city is nearing 900 so far. Dengue started to sting the city in June when the city received its first rains. “Usually, it rains in the city in July and ends by this time. This time it started raining in June and it is still raining. Dengue cases are usually reported till one or 1.5 month after the rains stop,” said VMC’s medical officer (health), Dr Devesh Patel. According to officials in the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC), this extended the dengue season. Patel said that major hurdle in controlling the disease was cooperation from people. “In several houses, people do not allow our workers to enter their homes. They say that they will take care of things themselves, but this does not happen,” said Patel. Sources said that dengue may still be peaking and it may be time even before numbers start going down again.

---||Rajkot||Project to make containers likely to sink sans govt help||Rajkot: Extreme shortage of containers in the country has turned out to be the biggest obstacle in export business with shipping charges going up by four to five times. A project to manufacture indigenous ISO shipping containers in Bhavnagar was designed a year ago, but lack of interest has left the project in a limbo. However, what appears to be a silver lining is the industry is that two manufacturers in Bhavnagar are ready to start commercial production of containers by January. However, the manufacturers don’t see any future if the government does not support their efforts. Domestic use of containers too increased especially after e-commerce companies started shipping in bulk from one corner of the country to another. The biggest obstacle in its manufacture is the availability of raw material. A committee was created under the umbrella of Saurashtra Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI) in Bhavnagar in November 2020 to address issues specific to the sector. The committee comprising manufacturers, buyers and representatives of Gujarat Maritime Board (GMB) has also made several representations to the ministry of ports shipping and waterways in the last one year. Containers need 75% corten steel as raw material, which gives it strength and also prevents corrosion. This steel needs to be imported from China and according to industry people, corten steel at present costs 15 to 20 percent more for Indian manufacturers than for Chinese manufacturers. Hasmukh Patel, a Bhavnagar-based businessman is in advance stage of manufacturing containers and he will be ready by January with two samples of containers — 20 feet and 40 feet each. If these meets expectations in the testing, Patel will start rolling by January. He is even ready to install own machinery only if the Indian manufacturers get government support. “If I want to do production commercially I need to install machinery which costs around Rs 125 to 150 crore. It’s a huge cost and manufacturers can’t take risk without government support like getting corten steel at competitive price, testing facilities locally and making the domestic market steady,” he added. The second biggest challenge is testing as containers need to pass through 14 kinds of testing. Bhavnagar manufacturers have to take the container for testing to a private operator near Delhi and transportation cost is huge. A testing facility costs around Rs 2.5 crore. Vaibhav Patel, another manufacturer of Bhavnagar, who is ready with sample containers said, “If we don’t get government support to create a common facility for testing near Bhavnagar, then this project is not viable.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/project-to-make-containers-likely-to-sink-sans-govt-help/articleshow/86101337.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

Tamil Nadu had the maximum 47,560 eye donations, followed by Gujarat (33,716) and Maharashtra (30,415). As per the data available on national organ and tissue transplant organisation’s website, total 19 kidneys were donated in Bihar in 2018 out of 3,379 across the country. Apart from kidney, 645 liver and 53 heart donations were also done in the country. Apart from the 2018 NOTTO data, Bihar has no other figures, even though other states have given the data of various organs donated.  Nephrologist Dr Pankaj Hans, who has handled many kidney-related cases, said, “Some people in Bihar believe that if they donate eyes, they will be born blind in the next birth. Mass movement is needed to burst such myths.” Talking about organ donations from the brain dead persons, Dr Hans suggested creation of a statewide network of government officials, NGOs, medical professionals as well as private hospitals so that there is no delay in declaring a patient brain dead, followed by immediate counselling of surviving relatives. So far, only two brain stem death certification has been done in Bihar, followed by donation of their organs. As per state organ and tissue transplant organization (SOTTO) information, one was on March 18 previous year. “In this case, the deceased’s mother herself had received a kidney and knew the urgency of organ donation. Another was in 2018 when a 17- year- old boy died in a road accident. His father was associated with social work and knew the importance of organ donation,” education and communication consultant Ekta Rani said. Talking about the difficulties in pursuing the family members, Ekta said many think that even when the heart is pumping, a person may recover and consider brain stem death to be coma, which is wrong. “There was a case of brain stem death in April this year. But, in spite of all the counselling, the family refused to donate organs,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-lags-behind-other-states-in-organ-donation/articleshow/86100600.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Inspector general (IG), traffic, M R Naik wrote to all SPs earlier this week asking them to brief the cops before assigning them duty on a day-to-day basis so that they behave properly with people on the roads. “The feedback from the cops after their day’s work is a must. This will help know how they functioned on a given day and what changes are required in their behaviour in future,” the IG’s letter said. The letter said the cops should discharge their duties with patience and perseverance. “It doesn’t mean that the violators of the Motor Vehicles Act are spared,” the letter pointed out. According to the letter, the police headquarters received numerous complaints through various sources about traffic cops’ misbehaviour with people on the roads. The letter raised concern over people’s growing anger against traffic police due to their misbehaviour and said if necessary action was not taken on time, it may result in a serious law and order problem in future. On Friday, a video went viral on social media platforms showing an ASI hurling abuses on a man near traffic check post at Gandhi Maidan in Patna. Recently, a Family of a Bhagalpur-based professor had to face the brunt of some traffic constables. Complaints about traffic police personnel slapping people or hurling abuses on them have been pouring in from different districts. “The fines can be realised from the violators of MV Act showing decent behaviour,” a senior IPS officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bihar-traffic-cops-asked-to-behave-well-with-people/articleshow/86100613.cms||Ramashankar

After easing of the Covid-19 restrictions, the hill station, a popular tourist destination in Dang district, has been attracting hundreds of tourists every weekend. According to sources, Dang collector Bhavin Pandya along with health officials rushed to the school in Saputara town on Friday and reviewed the testing and vaccination drive. “The two who tested positive were secondary students at a private school and they have been isolated. Their family members as well as teachers, students and clerical staff of the school are being tested for Covid,” Pandya said in a statement. Sources informed that one of the students who had tested positive was studying in class 10 while the other one was from class 9. After being closed for more than one and half year, the state government allowed schools to reopen for class 9 onwards from July 26. “The administration has been asked to conduct compulsory vaccination of all those who are working in restaurants, guest houses and other tourist centres. Checks have been intensified at the entry points from Maharashtra into the Dang district,” Pandya added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/two-school-students-test-ve-in-saputara/articleshow/86101187.cms||---
---||Patna||Restructuring of Farakka barrage must to solve Ganga flood problemm says Bihar minister Sanjay Kumar Jha||PATNA: State water resources department (WRD) minister Sanjay Kumar Jha said on Friday that the restructuring of Farakka barrage across the Ganga alone will help in solving the flood problem in the Gangetic basin of Bihar. Talking to mediapersons here, Jha said the Jalshakti ministry at the Centre has constituted a committee to look into the problem and also suggest recommendations. The central committee also has representatives of the Bihar government. “We have explained our situation. We hope that the committee will take decision in the light of our position on Farakka barrage,” he said. “Our position, as also explained by CM Nitish Kumar, is that the restructuring of Farakka barrage will solve much of the flood problem in the Gangetic basin. The volume of water flowing through the barrage is less than what it should be. The flow of water is restricted,” he said. According to Jha, if the restructuring of the barrage is not done, the flood problem will become “more dangerous, as it has already become dangerous” for the state and the Gangetic basin. The Ganga flows through Buxar, Bhojpur, Patna, Lakhisarai, Munger and Bhagalpur in south Bihar, while it passes through Saran, Vaishali, Samastipur, Begusarai, Khagaria and Katihar in north Bihar. The stretch of the Ganga in the state is slightly over 400km. In 2016, the river experts who participated in the national seminar held at Patna and Delhi had pointed to the siltation of the riverbed of Ganga as the main cause of flood in its basin both in north and south Bihar. Jha said the linking of rivers flowing through north and south Bihar – called intra-linking of rivers in the state -- could be an alternative solution to the flood problem on which the state government has been working. One pilot project each in south and north Bihar has been taken up – Sakri-Nata intra-linking project in south Bihar and the intra-linking of Bagmati, Burhi Gandak and Baya-Noon in north Bihar. “The project assessment work has begun. If the assessment shows that the projects will be successful, then a big breakthrough in flood control will occur,” Jha said. “Otherwise, we want a high dam in Nepal, which will also solve the flood problem in Bihar. But it will require government to government level talks between Nepal and India,” Jha said, adding: “In the meantime, we have started the assessment work for the intra-linking of the rivers in Bihar.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/restructuring-of-farakka-barrage-must-to-solve-ganga-flood-problem-bihar-minister/articleshow/86100459.cms||Abhay Singh

However, none of them has so far been tested positive for Covid. Purnia civil surgeon Dr S K Verma said of the 21 children undergoing treatment at the paediatrics unit of the GMCH, 10 are viral fever patients. “No child with Covid infection has been admitted to the hospital,” he said. The civil surgeon added children, especially those in the age group of two to five years, have been coming to the hospital in large numbers. “Most cases are of viral nature. However, some children are also complaining of upper respiratory infections, breathlessness and high fever. On Friday, 27 children were treated at the OPD of the hospital,” Dr Verma added. Asked if high fever causes convulsions, he said, “To prevent convulsions due to high fever among children, we give them Paracetamol and it temporarily passes off. As a precautionary measure, we conduct rapid antigen test on children coming to the hospital to rule out Covid infection and make it doubly sure that RT-PCR test is also performed on them.” “Altogether 64 children came to the hospital OPD for treatment with medical conditions like high fever, nasal rhinitis, breathlessness and upper respiratory infections in the last three days. No patient was found suffering from meningitis or Covid,” Dr Verma said. He added, “The paediatrics unit of the hospital is equipped with oxygen cylinders, humidifiers, oxygen masks and life-saving drugs. Two pressure swing absorption (PSA) oxygen generation plants with capacity to produce 1,000 litres of oxygen per minute are also in a ready mode.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/purnia-hospital-records-rise-in-viral-fever-cases-among-kids/articleshow/86100399.cms||---

His relatives have blamed a former mukhiya and probable candidate for the district board member post for the incident as Abhishek was allegedly working in favour of his rival candidate in the upcoming panchayat election. The incident took place when Abhishek, along with his brother, was returning home on a motorbike after offering prayers. The assailants waylaid them and pumped two bullets into Abhishek’s body. He was rushed to Hajipur Sadar hospital where the doctors declared him dead. As the news about his death spread in the area, Abhishek’s relatives and local residents disrupted vehicular traffic on Hajipur-Lalganj road on Friday, demanding immediate arrest of the culprits and adequate compensation to the bereaved family. Hajipur Sadar SDPO Raghav Dayal said Abhishek’s mother Asha Devi has lodged an FIR against four people, including a probable candidate in the panchayat polls. He said the road blockade was lifted on the assurances by the police that the accused would be arrested soon. “Raids are on to arrest the accused,” he told this reporter. However, an investigating officer said Abhishek had an altercation with an autorickshaw driver over some issue.

---||Patna||Bihar: Ramchandra Prasad Singh, Lalan Singh continue to play game of ‘one-upmanship’||PATNA: The game of checkmating the rival’s pawn and protecting loyalists has now come into play in the JD(U). A day after JD(U) president Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan Singh ordered dissolution of different cells of the party, removal of all 40 in-charges of the parliamentary constituencies and shifting of two staunch loyalists of Union steel minister RCP Singh from the party’s state headquarters here, the latter on Friday appointed four of his loyalists as personal aides in his office. Sources in JD(U) said RCP on Friday appointed four of his loyal party workers as his personal aides in the Union ministry. While former JD(U) MLA Abhay Kushwaha has been appointed as additional private secretary (APS) to the minister, Santosh Mehta, Bishan Kumar Bittu and Arun Verma have been appointed as assistants to him. Their services will continue as long as RCP remains Union minister, sources said. Known as a hardcore loyalist of the Union minister, Abhay Kushwaha had led the JD(U) leaders in arranging a grand reception for RCP from Patna airport to the party’s state office on August 16 when the bureaucrat-turned-politician had reached the city on his maiden visit after becoming the Union minister. Earlier, Abhay had courted a controversy by putting up hundreds of posters on different cross-sections of Patna to welcome RCP. The photo of JD(U) national president Lalan Singh was missing from those posters. Abhay also held the post of state president of Yuva JD(U) before he was appointed as state general secretary of the party. Earlier on Thursday, Lalan, after holding a meeting to review the performance of different cells of the state JD(U), ordered dissolutions of all 32 cells at the district and block levels. The idea of having a separate committee of all cells at the district and block levels was floated by RCP when he was the party’s national president. Moreover, the heads of all these cells were appointed by RCP. Lalan also removed all 40 in-charges of the parliamentary constituencies who were chosen and appointed by RCP. Moreover, the party’s two state general secretaries – Anil Kumar and Chandan Kumar Singh – who had been looking after the party’s crucial matters at the state headquarters for the last several years, were on Thursday shifted from the party headquarters and asked to look into the affairs of Kishanganj and Araria districts, respectively. Anil and Chandan, who are known loyalists of RCP, are said to be working for positive propaganda of the Union steel minister while sitting in the state JD(U) office.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rcp-lalan-continue-to-play-game-of-one-upmanship/articleshow/86100634.cms||Madan Kumar

District magistrate (DM) Dr Chandrashekhar Singh issued an order in this regard after holding a meeting with representatives of transport union on Friday. It was also decided that “chungi” would be collected only once a day for a month. “At Mithapur bus stand, chungi was being collected twice a day. At the new bus terminal at Bairiya, it will be collected once to help transporters. The executive committee of PBT maintains the account meant for development of the bus terminal,” the DM told this newspaper. Singh also asked the officials concerned to improve the basic amenities like dormitory and toilets for drivers and staff at the bus terminal. “About 500 buses are being parked at the PBT though the total number of buses originating and terminating from the terminal is around 3,000. Parking space for 100 more buses will be created in a month,” the DM said. He, however, warned the transporters against unauthorised parking of buses on roads outside the bus terminal. “Owners of such buses will be fined and the road permit of the erring vehicles cancelled,” he added. Since many buses are parked on Patna-Gaya road instead of the PBT, it causes traffic congestion in the locality. “Apart from the police outpost, 150 private security guards have been deputed there. Additional magistrates with adequate police force have also been assigned duty to check illegal parking of buses,” the DM added. Expressing displeasure over delay in some construction works at PBT, the DM said all these works should be completed in 10 days so that more buses can be parked there.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/bus-terminal-to-have-better-connectivity-soon-patna-dm/articleshow/86100244.cms||VK Tripathi

The hospital has got affiliation to the course for five years from National Board of Examinations (NBE), New Delhi, an autonomous body under the ministry of health and family welfare. According to ECR chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar, the NBE affiliation will be extended further depending on its performance. “The NBE has allotted six seats to the hospital — two seats each in family medicine, gynaecology and paediatrics department,” he said. According to Kumar, admission to DNB course will be made through NEET and the candidate must have completed PG either in medicine or surgery. Thus DNB is a post-MD or MS degree awarded by NBE, he said. According to sources , the two-year DNB course is based on clinical training. There will be no theoretical class for DNB candidates as they will specialize in certain course after completion of the three-year residency at PG. Sources said this hospital caters to the needs of about 90,000 railway employees and their family members in the ECR’s five divisions. It is the fourth superspecialty hospital of railways in the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/railway-hospital-in-patna-to-start-dnb-course/articleshow/86100331.cms||Kumod Verma

Neeraj also submitted a video clip of the episode, which he had obtained from the RJD’s social media account, to the commission to substantiate his claim. In his letter, Neeraj said Tejashwi’s act violated the model code of conduct enforced in the state by the SEC in view of the panchayat elections. In the video clip, Tejashwi could be seen distributing money among women from his car. Neeraj alleged Tejashwi distributed money among the poor women on the occasion of Teej festival to garner their support. The BJP also accused Tejashwi of violating model code of conduct by distributing money among women voters to lure them. National general secretary of BJP’s OBC wing, Nikhil Anand, said Tejashwi was following in the footsteps of his father Lalu Prasad. “He belongs to the same party which sells ticket during Lok Sabha and assembly elections. RJD has no principle of its own,” Anand said. Meanwhile, the RJD has described the allegations as baseless. Party’s state spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan said Tejashwi had met a few flood-hit women and gave them some money as help. “People are starving in the flood-affected areas, but the government is least concerned about them. Tejashwi ji did not do anything wrong by helping the poor and the needy,” he added. Another RJD spokesperson, Mritunjay Tiwari, questioned the transfers and postings of IAS and IPS officers being done by the government at a time when model code of conduct is in place in the state. “JD(U) should first teach discipline to its MLAs and other functionaries. They should be stopped from moving around naked at public places. I hope they have taken note of MLA Gopal Mandal’s act on a running train,” Tiwari added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/jdu-accuses-tejashwi-of-luring-women-voters-by-distributing-money/articleshow/86100416.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Dehradun||Restarting construction of hydro projects a profound error: 64 environmentalists pen open letter to PM, environment ministry||Dehradun: A group of 64 environmentalists and activists has issued an open letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Union ministry of environment, forests, and climate change (MOEF&CC) demanding reconsideration of the Centre's decision to restart the construction of seven hydroelectric power projects (HEPs) in Uttarakhand. The construction is halted since 2014. The letter says restarting construction work would be a “profound error” and a “self-defeating exercise” and prove dangerous to the local population. Citing the environmental impact of each of the HEPs, the letter said, “…it would be a profound error, indeed a self-defeating exercise, to implement any more HEPs in the Himalayas and on the Ganga, whether under- construction, new or proposed. The life security of our people is at stake here, and is paramount.” The signatories to the letter include Pradip Tamta, Rajya Sabha MP from Almora , Kunwar Rewati Raman Singh, Rajya Sabha member from Uttar Pradesh; retired Allahabad HC judge, Justice Giridhar Malviya, historian Ramchandra Guha, retired Kumaun University professor Shekhar Pathak, Ravi Chopra, chairman of SC-appointed high-powered committee on the Char Dham Pariyojana; activist Malika Bhanot and Medha Patkar, founder of Narmada Bachao Andolan among others. The letter comes nearly a month after the central government gave a go-ahead to restarting construction works on seven HEPs — Tehri II (1000 MW), Tapovan-Vishnugad (520 MW), Vishnugad-Pipalkoti (444 MW), Singoli-Bhatwari (99 MW), Phata-Byung (76 MW), Madhmaheshwar (15 MW), and Kaliganga II (4.5 MW). The decision goes against the findings of an expert body as six of these seven projects (except Tehri II) lie either in para-glacial zones or their buffer, adds the letter. The expert body, constituted in 2014 on the orders of the Supreme Court (SC), had said that the power projects in the Himalayan region aggravate disaster while also causing ‘irreparable environmental damage’. The letter points out that the findings of the expert body were even supported by the MoEFF&CC at the time. “In direct contradiction to this, the only reasons given for restarting these projects is that ‘a substantial progress and sizable investment’ has been made,” the environmentalists said. The letter added that the ‘collective conscience’ of the signatories and ‘science’ demands that the decision should be reversed. “There are alternatives for electricity generation but there are no alternatives for our age-long cultural and civilisational identity- the Ganga and the Himalayas,” the letter said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/restarting-construction-of-hydro-projects-a-profound-error-64-environmentalists-pen-open-letter-to-pm-environment-ministry/articleshow/86100285.cms||Prashant Jha

Health department has already expressed its concern over the spread and has asked district collectors to expedite the anti-larvae activities including fogging. In most of the parts of the state, fogging has not been started despite the mosquitoes breeding, as water stagnation during the monsoon has given conducive environment for the breeding of the mosquitoes. TOI on Thursday accessed the figures of the vector-borne diseases including dengue, malaria and chikungunya and it was found that compared to last year, there has been a rise in dengue and Chikungunya. “Up till September 2020, there were 717 dengue cases which are 1,022 so far. Thankfully, no deaths have been reported, still there is a need to remain alert on the vector-borne diseases especially dengue,” said Ravi Prakash Sharma, additional director (rural health). He added that the department has been monitoring the progress of the anti-larvae activities in the state. “Also, malaria is a big cause of concern. Compared to 449 positive cases in September 2020 there are 649 cases in this year so far,” said an officer with the health department. Authorities stated that the months of September and October would be crucial in terms of vector-borne diseases. Doctors further stated that patients with high fever are advised to go for dengue, malaria and chikungunya tests apart from the RT-PCR tests. “September and October are going to be very crucial for doctors too as it would be challenging to diagnose the reason of the fever, which could be dengue, malaria or chikungunya,” said a senior physician at the SMS Hospital. It may be recalled that the state had reported seven deaths due to dengue. “Also, last year, 2,023 cases of dengue were found while 1,015 cases of chikungunya were also found,” said an officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/vector-borne-diseases-on-the-rise-sept-oct-crucial/articleshow/86102246.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Custody battle on, man flees with child||AHMEDABAD: In a battle over custody of a girl, the Gujarat high court ordered the child’s father to live at his wife’s residence for a few days and leave the daughter with her for four weeks, but the father disappeared with the girl and the HC has ordered an intense search for the child, whose liberty and safety the court fears is at stake. The HC ordered so on August 17, in response to a habeas corpus petition filed by the mother of the six-year-old through advocate Deepmala Desai in March. Considering the acrimonious relationship between the couple, the judges ordered, “We direct the parties to maintain peace and decorum and allow the corpus aged about 6 years to have free interactions with other family members of the petitioner’s mother, her parents and siblings.” After ordering the man to live with his in-laws for a couple of days, he was permitted to return to his family, leaving the daughter in his wife’s custody. The HC also ordered officers of Gujarat State Legal Service Authority to visit the family and then submit a report. A week later, the HC was informed that the father had left for Delhi and taken the child along. The HC promised a strict stance and ordered him to report at the courtroom with the child on August 24, “failing which, stringent actions including action under the contempt laws may be taken against him. If he doesn’t report by tomorrow morning, the police in cooperation with Delhi Police may trace him and produce him immediately before this court”. The next day, police informed the court that the man’s mobile phone was traced to Unnao in UP. The state government assured the court that police would make their best efforts to trace the man and produce him and the child in court as soon as possible. On September 6, the court said it “earnestly desired reunion of the family” and ordered the man to stay with in-laws, but the arrangement did not work out for long. The judges noted that the issue has assumed “serious proportions” because the liberty of the child and her safety appear to be at stake. The court was furious at the police for being content merely with recording statements of the man’s neighbours. The judges said, “The court does not expect the police authorities to rest with taking mere statements from the neighbours. This lethargy is not tolerable.” The court ordered the formation of a police team to go to UP to bring the man back, but by the time they reached there, he had left the place. The HC on Thursday ordered DCP (Zone 5) to oversee efforts to locate the father and daughter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/custody-battle-on-man-flees-with-child/articleshow/86101055.cms||---

Poaching of multiple tigers is involved. Deputy conservator of forests (DyCF) Dr Bharat Singh Hada said that both the raids conducted on Thursday were follow-up to the earlier action taken in the recent past. From July 29, World Tiger Day, till now officials have arrested 29 persons in various poaching cases. All accused have been sent to jail. Hada said that based on information from cyber cell, two persons were arrested with a tiger nail and three bone pieces from Sitapur (Gondi) in Deolapar forest range. The accused, Rajkumar Markam (29) and Kamalsingh Bhalavi (40), have been remanded to forest custody till September 16. In another raid, three tiger poachers were arrested from Bhatari in Pombhurna range in Central Chanda. The village is on the fringes of Kanhargaon wildlife sanctuary and the tiger was electrocuted in the FDCM area. Officials seized six tiger nails and 13 whiskers, besides weapons and wire snares. The accused were identified as Ramchandra Bawne from Kemara village and Yogesh Todase and Prabhakar Todase, both from Bhatari in Pombhurna range. All are habitual wildlife criminals and were going to strike a deal at Borkhedi toll plaza on NH-7. Sources said the tiger was electrocuted in January this year due to live electric wires laid to kill herbivores for bushmeat. The accused had removed the tiger’s body parts and burned the carcass. Officials said the accused showed the spot where the tiger was buried but only 5.5kg bones were recovered. “It is suspected they must have removed the tiger skin,” said officials. According to sources, this is a fresh case of tiger poaching and has nothing to do with the four accused arrested on August 31 from Pachgaon, which is also on the fringes of Kanhargaon. “Officials had seized 16 tiger bones, skull, whiskers, canines, porcupine quills, peacock feathers and other body parts from them,” said sources. Prior to this, another gang of four accused was arrested with tiger body parts from Masal near Tadoba and Tass near Umred-Karhandla wildlife sanctuary on August 27. This indicates that at least 4-5 tigers must have been poached. Separate gangs are targeting tigers in territorial areas where protection has reached a new low. Earlier, in Deolapar case, 13kg tiger bones were seized from the accused on August 26. ACFs Narendra Chandewar said that more arrests are likely in the Sitapur case. Till the filing of this report, the action by forest officials continued.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/another-tiger-poached-on-kanhargaon-fringe-3-arrested/articleshow/86100312.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

People eased their way in from the half-done barricading on the northern side of the lake for immersion. NMC also failed to barricade Sonegaon Lake, while it did its job in Gandhisagar and Sakkardara lakes. Devotees also immersed Gauri in Ambazari Lake. Surendragadh resident Pooja Sathawne said, “Sufficient alternative arrangements were not in place for the immersion. There was only one artificial tank which was surrounded by a large number of people, hence I immersed Teej material in the lake itself.”Like Sathawne, Friends Colony resident Manjusha Kothe also did the immersions in Futala Lake as there was “a huge crowd around the artificial tank”. “With the rain intensifying, I preferred not to wait and did the immersions in the lake,” Kothe said.Both Sathawne and Kothe said they are aware of NMC’s diktat of ban on immersions in the city’s water bodies.A senior official from Dharampeth zone’s solid waste management department admitted that the civic body could not erect sufficient artificial tanks or barricade the lake fully, which caused the lapse.It is also learnt that the zone’s public works department failed to issue a work order for barricading the lake with tin sheds, thus giving devotees an easy access for immersions directly in the lake. Environmentalist and Green Vigil Foundation founder Kaustav Chatterjee said, “Futala Lake is one of the most preferred spots for all visarjans and hence, the lake should have been barricaded much earlier. The lake has already witnessed significant immersions of Krishna idols during Janmashtami and Teej.” NMC staff is having a tough time cleaning the lake prior to Ganpati Visarjan. “Like last year, barricading of Futala Lake needs to be done to completely block any access to the lake,” Chatterjee pointed out. Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari admitted to a delay in barricading the lakes but was quick to add that the civic body will prevent immersion of idols with the help of citizens. He also said that civic cops will be deployed to prevent pollution of water bodies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-caught-off-guard-by-gauri-teej-immersions-in-futala/articleshow/86100307.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

This was disclosed by Brijesh Kumar Sant, secretary to the governor on Friday. “The governor- designate is likely to reach Dehradun a day prior to the oath-taking ceremony,” Sant said. Singh, who was a Deputy Chief of Army Staff, is regarded as an expert on China and Pakistan affairs. He served in the Indian Army for almost four decades before retiring in 2016. He also commanded the strategic XV Corps that overlooks the Line of Control in Kashmir and was handling operational and military strategic issues pertaining to China as additional director general of military operations. He is the second Sikh to be appointed to the governor’s post in Uttarakhand, after the state's first governor, Surjit Singh Barnala. Meanwhile, the exit of Baby Rani Maurya two years before her term was to end and the appointment of Singh just ahead of the assembly polls is being seen as an attempt to reach out to the significant defence population in the hill state. It is also being seen by political analysts as a means to appease the Sikh fraternity in the state which has a sizeable presence in Udham Singh Nagar district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/new-uttarakhand-governor-likely-to-take-oath-on-september-15/articleshow/86100317.cms||Gaurav Talwar

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: ‘No forceful migration of Hindu families from Tonk’||JAIPUR: Tonk police on Friday rejected the reports about forceful migration of Hindu families due to communal tension in Malpura tehsil of the district. Quoting local media reports, BJP state president Satish Poonia claimed that 300 Hindus families left Malpura due to lack of security. Police in its preliminary report have cleared that it never received complaint by any family leaving or selling property under pressure from communal forces. Police found that the charge related to one Hindu family selling a house to a Muslim on September 7 was being objected to by residents of the same locality. Tonk SP, Om Prakash told TOI, “The claim of 300 families migrating and sense of insecurity among the majority community is misleading and far from reality. Our teams have figured out that families of both Hindus and Muslims have been migrating from Malpura for a common reason – better future.” To verify the claims made by BJP chief Poonia and the locals, the police approached the revenue department officials and learnt that the house deal that has led to the controversy was the first of its kind in recent years in which a Hindu sold a property to a Muslim. The SP said, “In a nutshell, the matter is between the buyer and the seller. No one can oppose the land deal unless any legal violation is taking place.” The house in question is located at a Jain Mohalla that was handed over by one Hemraj Sharma to Ibrahim Khan on September 7 evening. The next day citizens from Malpura Municipal ward numbers – 11, 12, 19, 20 and 21 gathered to oppose the deal citing that a Muslim family in a non-Muslim neighbourhood can create law and order problems. Advocate Krishan Kant Jain, a resident of the Jain Mohalla who is leading the campaign along with a builder Rajkumar Jain, told TOI, “The house purchased by a Muslim comes in the way of our historic Digamber Adinath Jain temple. It would be very uncomfortable and unwise to pass a house which consumes non-veg, which is strictly prohibited in our religion.” He further used his legal know-how to justify the move, said, “It is very much legal to purchase the house anywhere. However, if its poses any security threat to a group of people, it becomes fundamental for the state to protect them and even cancel the house deal.” Jain claimed to have records to show that over 300 Hindu families migrated from Malpura since 1992. The matter has no longer remained in the limits of Malpura, a cantonment in the erstwhile Tonk. BJP was quick to slap charges of appeasement politics on the ruling Congress ahead of the assembly session on Thursday. The saffron party on Friday formed a three-member fact-finding committee to look into alleged migration of Hindu families from Malpura. The committee members include—Sikar MP Swami Sumedhanand Saraswati, Sojat MLA Shobha Chauhan and former MLA Alwar Banwari Lal Singhal. The committee has been instructed to leave for Malpura at the earliest and submit a report to the party.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/no-forceful-migration-of-hindu-families-from-tonk/articleshow/86102255.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Outram Kannad Ghat Rd to open for light motor vehicles||Aurangabad: Despite the challenges resulting from incessant rainfall in the region, National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) plans to open the national highway passing through Outram Ghat of Kannad for light vehicles by September 15. However, heavy vehicles will be allowed to commute on this portion of national highway only by the end of this month. NHAI project director Avinash Kale told TOI, “We will open the highway for light vehicles on September 15, while for heavy vehicles, the highway can be opened only by month-end.” The officer said that the repair work is underway on war footing, but incessant rainfall is adding to existing challenges. The Dhule-Aurangabad-Solapur national highway 211 that connects the states of Punjab, Rajasthan, Gujarat to central, western Maharashtra and several southern states, passes through the 10km-long stretch of the ghat. The section had to be closed down after major landslides took place at eight different spots in the wee hours of August 31. Dozens of vehicles were stuck at different locations due to the landslides, while one mini truck got washed away killing its driver and damaging several other vehicles. To ensure that there are no further traffic snarls on the key route, Aurangabad rural police deployed check posts on both sides of the ghat and diverted traffic through interior roads passing via Panpoi-Chapaner-Shiur Bangla-Nandgaon-Chalisgaon areas in rural Aurangabad. However, another landslide took place at Nagad ghat section that passes through Gautala wildlife sanctuary on the morning of September 7. This section of the state highway falls under the jurisdiction of the Public Works Department. The department is also struggling to repair the roads that have been badly damaged due to the presence of large boulders and mud on the road.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/outram-kannad-ghat-rd-to-open-for-light-motor-vehicles/articleshow/86099434.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Nagpur||5 hours after they fled, 4 girls reunited with families by cops||NAGPUR: City police tracked down and reunited four minor girls with their parents, five hours after they fled from their respective residences on Thursday. Allegedly disappointed with their “uncaring parents”, the girls (an eight-year-old, her 11-year-old sister and their neighbours aged 12 and 13) had sneaked out from their homes in Wathoda and were headed to Akot in Akola district on Thursday evening. Cops found one of the girls, who was dejected as her mother ostensibly remained glued to mobile phone games and ignored her. The foursome had just Rs 400 with them — received as ‘bojhara’ (donations) during the just-concluded Pola festival — while leaving home and wanted to reach Akola by means not yet ascertained. City police struggled for five hours to track down the girls, who were reunited with their families in the presence of city police chief (CP) Amitesh Kumar, joint police commissioner Aswati Dorje and others at Wathoda police station around 11.30pm. The various WhatsApp groups created by cops at the police-station level for coordination and community policing turned saviour, as a member of one of the groups (Ankit) learnt about the girls being spotted at Chhapru Nagar and alerted the detection branch of Wathoda police station. CP Kumar said “petty issues” with their parents had prompted the girls to leave their homes. “Though the minors were promptly reunited with their families, we are trying to arrange expert counselling, involving child protection officials and other units, to ensure such an incident is not repeated,” Kumar added. Senior police inspector (sr PI) Ashalata Khapre from Wathoda station, who led the rescue operation under zonal deputy police commissioner (DCP) Akshay Shinde and additional CP Navinchandra Reddy, said the four minors belong to economically weak families. Sr PI Khapre said, “Two of the minors earlier stayed in Akot before shifting to Nagpur with their family. They persuaded their neighbours to come along and meet their friends in Akot. The four girls found a common thread to bond with each other as they were agonized by their parents." Khapre added that the girls seemed to have become victims of lockdown-induced stress within the family. She said another girl had changed her mind at the last minute to remain safe. “The families approached the cops within 30 minutes and I alerted the entire city police units immediately, including our seniors," Khapre stated. Police said the girls left home in the late afternoon and took an autorickshaw from a place near Symbiosis College and reached KDK College near Nandanvan, where one of their relatives stayed. The minors were planning to reach the railway station on foot before taking a train, cops added. After alighting from the autorickshaw, the foursome stepped into the Nandanvan slums and later strayed towards Wardhaman Nagar, where they were spotted and rescued. Kumar said private bus operators and state transport bus drivers, conductors were alerted. “We announced Rs50,000 cash rewards too,” he added. Khapre said CCTVs were scanned and cops were sent to Nandanvan slums, Tajbagh and every other place where the girls were likely to be found. “We were lucky to spot the same autorickshaw which had ferried the girls from Symbiosis College to KDK. Police have also counselled the autorickshaw driver about not ferrying such a bunch of minors without any adult accompanying them," added Khapre. The sr PI further said that crime branch units were also pressed into action under addl CP Sunil Phulari. “Police personnel, including the CP and joint CP, conducted the initial counselling of the girls. We handed over the minors to their parents and contacted NGOs and government agencies for counselling and other assistance," Khapre added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/5-hours-after-they-fled-4-girls-reunited-with-families-by-cops/articleshow/86100323.cms||Soumitra Bose

---||Pune||Avoid panicking over drop in platelet count in dengue: Pune experts||PUNE: A sharp rise in dengue cases in Pune has led to widespread panic over falling platelet count, often resulting in undue platelet transfusion, bringing to mind the paranoia over remdesivir during the second Covid wave. A normal person has a platelet count ranging between 1,50,000 and 4,50,000 per microlitre of blood. About 80-90% of patients with dengue will have levels below 1,00,000, while 10-20% of the patients will see critically low levels of 20,000 or less. However, only about 5% of dengue patients face complications, such as bleeding, which require platelet transfusions. “Platelet transfusion in the absence of bleeding does not prevent bleeding. Such a practice is associated with slower platelet recovery and increased length of hospitalization,” experts have warned. Ruby Hall Clinic’s chief intensivist Kapil Zirpe suggested a strict check on the sale and usage use blood platelet bags at blood banks and hospitals to stop undue blood transfusion. “I feel there is an urgent need to audit the usage of blood platelet transfusion among dengue patients in Pune. The district administration or civic health officials should step in to limit the use of blood products.” Sharing the view, Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital’s chief intensivist Prasad Rajhans said, “With supportive care, most patients with critically low platelet counts will recover after a few days.” He said, “Platelet transfusion in absence of bleeding in adult dengue with platelet count less than 20,000 per microlitre does not reduce chances of bleeding and expedite platelet recovery. Instead, this practice is associated with a slower platelet recovery and increased length of hospitalization,” Rajhans said. Conversely, transfusion of blood products may be detrimental to patients as it can carry risks of fluid overload, the transmission of infectious diseases, and transfusion-linked reactions/side effects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/avoid-panicking-over-drop-in-platelet-count-in-dengue-experts/articleshow/86101656.cms||Umesh Isalkar

---||Nagpur||2nd vulture-safe veterinary pain-killer drug identified||NAGPUR: In a significant development, a systematic safety testing study led by the Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI) with the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) has identified tolfenamic acid as the second confirmed vulture-safe non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) after meloxicam. In 2003, the veterinary use of diclofenac to treat cattle as a painkiller was discovered to be the cause of catastrophic vulture declines across South Asia. Meloxicam was tested in 2006 and found to be both safe for vultures and effective in treating cattle. However, now tolfenamic acid has been identified as the second confirmed vulture-safe NSAID. This has been found after 38 vultures and one each of white-backed vulture and long-billed vulture were given doses of tofenamic. Talking to TOI, Chris Bowden, Globally Threatened Species Officer & Saving Asia’s Vultures from Extinction (SAVE) program manager, said “Since the 2006 national ban of veterinary diclofenac, until now we could only recommend one safe alternative drug for use on cattle. Having tolfenamic acid as a second safe alternative is a huge boost and we hope this helps vets and farmers to avoid using the deadly alternatives, including aceclofenac, nimesulide and ketoprofen.” Bowden, who is also co-chair IUCN Vulture Specialist Group, added, “It is a pleasant change to have some good news for once. Over 97% of all vultures have already gone, so unless news like this can make a real difference for decision-makers, India’s vultures may be condemned to history books.” Bowden said 38 wild-caught Himalayan Griffon Vultures, along with a single captive white-rumped and long-billed vultures from the conservation breeding population, were given doses of tolfenamic acid by oral gavage at the maximum possible level likely to be encountered by birds feeding on carcasses in the wild. This was calculated based on concentrations of diclofenac found in cattle carcasses in India, which showed that vets and livestock owners routinely give doses of this drug much higher than the recommended level. In addition, four Himalayan Griffons were also fed buffalo meat from animals and given double the recommended dose of tolfenamic acid just prior to death. Although two of the Himalayan Griffons given the extremely high dose by gavage died, all other birds survived without an increase in uric acid levels in the blood, which is the usual sign of kidney failure caused by NSAID poisoning. These findings show that tolfenamic acid is safe for wild vultures at levels of the drug that they are likely to be exposed to. Dr Chandra Mohan, scientist of IVRI and the lead investigator, said, “Every painkiller available has slightly different properties, and the vets often complained of not having a second choice of NSAIDs. But tolfenamic acid has been found as a second safe NSAID drug.” Dr Vibhu Prakash, principal scientist and vulture programme director of Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), said, “By testing first on the less threatened Himalayan Griffon Vultures, we could establish the comparative safety of the drug. We then also tested it on the most threatened species held at the breeding centre at Pinjore, Haryana. The results of this study are reported in an IVRI report.” Tolfenamic acid is already licensed and produced by a number of different Indian manufacturers, being out of patent, and similarly priced to other drugs. Professor Rhys Green of Cambridge University UK, and chair of the SAVE consortium, said: “After 16 years and considerable effort in safety testing NSAIDs on vultures we have found a second vulture-safe NSAID for use on cattle. This is important and welcome news. It will reduce pressure to use toxic alternatives such as aceclofenac, ketoprofen, flunixin and nimesulide, which are still available and legally used in the region.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/2nd-vulture-safe-veterinary-pain-killer-drug-identified/articleshow/86101660.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

The state had passed the Uttarakhand Freedom of Religion Act in 2018. Dhami told the media he has asked police officers to come up with a proposal for “more stringent provisions so that love jihad cases can be effectively tackled.” He added, “We already have the Uttarakhand Freedom of Religion Act, 2018, but we are going to make the provisions more stringent.” The Uttarakhand anti-conversion law stipulates a prison term of one to five years for anyone convicted of “forced or fraudulent” conversion, a non-bailable offence. The term goes up to two to seven years if the person “forcefully converted” is a minor, woman or belongs to an SC or ST community. The law also mentions the provision for fines but doesn’t say how much. Sources said the state may follow the UP model while framing amendments. The UP Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020, sets forth a prison term of up to 10 years if the person “converted” is a minor, woman or from an SC/ST community or if there is a case of “mass conversion”. It also specifies by how much someone convicted should be penalised — at least Rs 15,000 for “forced conversion”, Rs 25,000 if it’s a minor, woman or someone from an SC/ST community, and Rs 50,000 for mass conversion. Additionally, the accused has to pay a maximum Rs 5 lakh compensation to the “victim”. Uttarakhand’s BJP government had framed the existing law after the high court asked it to come up with one, on the lines of the Madhya Pradesh Freedom of Religion Act, 1968 and Himachal Pradesh Freedom of Religion Act, 2006 in November 2017. “It has come to our notice that the conversion from one religion to another is often a sham conversion only to facilitate the process of marriage,” it had said then. Soon after the announcement, the opposition criticised the plan as a “poll gimmick”. “If the situation is so alarming that the CM has to announce more stringent measures, he needs to tell people about the number of conversion cases reported in Uttarakhand,” said Congress legislator from Kedarnath, Manoj Rawat. “It is a poll agenda, aimed at misleading voters.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-to-make-anti-conversion-law-more-stringent/articleshow/86100330.cms||Kautilya Singh

Delhi government’s education department, therefore, hasn’t been able to fill all the seats under the EWS/DG category. Of the approximately 50,000 seats reserved in nursery, kindergarten and Class I for this category, the department has only conducted draws of lots to pick around 33,000. Even this reduced lot aren’t ensured admission. Worried parents have approached the Directorate of Education office to demand admission. Shaina has been trying to get her two children admitted in Class I in a private school in Anand Vihar for some months. “The school constantly says it cannot admit my kids because the general category admission hasn’t been carried out,” said Shaina. “If my children don’t get admission, I will have a lot of problems because there are hardly any EWS/DG admissions in Class II.” The Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights has sent a notice on her behalf, but the school hasn’t reacted. A government official explained, “We conducted the draw of lots based on last year's reference, but even the fewer children chosen through lots are facing admission problems. We have told the schools they must admit the selected children and to inform us when the general admissions are conducted.” The district deputy education officers have been asked to closely monitor the status of admissions. “After taking stock of the situation, we will see about additional draw of lots,” said the official. “We must keep in mind that there cannot be a situation in which just children in the reserved category are studying without any new general student being admitted. It is due to the Covid pandemic that such circumstances have arisen.” Education activists are assisting parents in questioning Delhi government on why it is not acting against schools denying admission to the EWS/DG students. Ekramul Haque of Mission Taleem said, “Schools are not complying even with the orders of DCPCR. Why is Delhi government not acting against these schools? I have been contacted by hundreds of parents who are having an exasperating time trying to get their children admitted to school.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/pandemic-hurts-poor-kids-chances-to-study/articleshow/86101661.cms||Shradha Chettri

But the moment of hesitation came too late as, unable to hold on to the railing, the 30-year-old slipped, fell into the river, and died. The incident occurred at Dadhichi Bridge on Friday afternoon. Some people tried to help him by leaning over and offering their hand but they were unable to save him as the fencing, which was installed to prevent suicides, hindered their attempts to rescue him. Onlookers said that Parmar climbed over the iron grill on the bridge and stood facing the river for a while. He slipped and hung on to the railing on the bridge for a few seconds before falling to his watery grave. A video in which Parmar is seen falling into the river and drowning has also gone viral. Police, who sent his body for post mortem to the Civil Hospital in Asarwa, said the reason behind his suicide is not known.

As per the complaint lodged by Ramesh Mishra (60), a resident of Alok Nagar, the suspect, who is a share market trader, had access to his phone and all the online transaction details including online purchase. He would take the suspect’s help to make transactions. In June 2019, the suspect convinced Mishra to start trading in the share market and accordingly a demat account was opened. Shares were purchased and sold between June, July and August 2019. After Mishra did not get expected returns, he stopped trading. However, as the suspect had access to net banking id and password, he allegedly obtained a loan of Rs 4.25 lakh loan from the bank. After the bank credited the loan amount to Mishra’s account, the suspect at the end of September 2019, transferred Rs 3.85 lakh to his different bank accounts without Mishra’s knowledge, the police said. After he learnt about the alleged cheating, he asked the suspect to return the money. But after his pleas fell on deaf ears, he reached out to the police and lodged a complaint.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/tenant-faces-charge-of-duping-landlord/articleshow/86099449.cms||Mohammed Akhef
---||Agra||Uttar Pradesh: Expired medicines given to patients at Firozabad health camp||AGRA: Expired medicines were allegedly distributed among patients with symptoms of dengue during a government health camp in UP’s Firozabad district, causing six people, including three children, to fall sick moments after taking the drugs. A pregnant woman also had to be rushed to the district hospital in critical condition. The district administration has now launched a probe into the incident on Thursday. According to residents of Amri village, a health department team had organised a medical camp for people suffering from dengue-like symptoms. Medicines were provided to 200 people, including 150 children, who were suffering from high fever. Soon after, three children started vomited while three others also complained of feeling sick. “When we checked the dates on the medicines, we found that a majority of them were expired,” said a resident. Brajesh Kumar’s wife, who was pregnant and running a high fever, also vomited and complained of stomach ache after taking the medicines. The woman, writhing in pain, was rushed to the hospital. “They gave her two medicines and she fell sick immediately after. The medicines had expired in April and yet they were given to people. This is shocking. We have complained to the local authorities. The health department will be responsible in case anything happens to my wife or my unborn child,” Kumar told TOI. Sub-divisional magistrate (Shikohabad), Devendra Pal Singh, said the authorities have taken cognisance of the matter and ordered a probe into the incident. “Strict action will be taken against those found guilty. Medicines were redistributed in the village later,” he said. Government health camps in rural areas are a crucial part of the UP government’s fight against dengue in the worst-hit Firozabad district as patients scramble for beds and deaths are reported daily. In the last four weeks, 104 people, most of them children, have died in Firozabad district from a viral fever which a team of the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has identified to be dengue. According to former village head, Sahab Singh, every other house in the village has at least one patient suffering from fever. “Patients can’t be admitted to government hospitals as there are no vacant beds available. Despite repeated requests, cleanliness work has not been carried out in our village. Waterlogging and lack of proper sanitation and hygiene is resulting in the spread of such diseases.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/at-up-health-camp-expired-meds-given-to-suspected-dengue-patients-many-ill-probe-on/articleshow/86100346.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Activists call for unshackling of trees from iron cages||KOLKATA: Citizens and green activists have called for an end to the ‘Plant it, cage it and forget it’ practice during sapling plantation drives and demanded trees be unshackled from old rusted iron cages that have long outlived their purpose. While several rusted tree guards have got embedded into tree trunks, others have transformed into garbage bins that are choking the trees. Installing cages when plantation drives are carried out is an old legacy that dates back to several decades, when cows and goats roamed the city streets. The eviction of khatals or cowsheds from the city in the early 1980s ended the primary survival challenge for saplings. Arjan Basu Roy, who runs environment action group Nature Mates, that helps transplant trees and clean up water bodies, is perplexed why the metal tree guards aren’t removed after a couple of years when a sapling grows into a small tree. TimesViewThis is extreme callousness. It is highly ironic that measures meant to protect trees are ending up harming them. Agencies and persons responsible for their upkeep must take action as soon as possible.“It makes sense to reuse the tree guards in a new plantation drive instead of letting them rot and harm the trees,” he reasoned. TOI found tree guards on Gariahat Road, Gurusaday Road, Ballygunge Circular Road and in neighbourhoods around Deshapriya Park that were either restricting the growth of tree trunks or had been turned into garbage bins. “This problem is a reflection of the lack of overall policy on tree planting—the species, the spacing between trees, their protection and maintenance. We take trees for granted and plant them without thought, cage them without respect and hack them without consequences,” rued environmentalist Bonani Kakkar of NGO PUBLIC. Tree experts believe there is no protection required in Kolkata when young trees that are around 6 ft tall are used in plantations. “It is a better idea to create a prop so that the trunk grows straight and does not lean. That way, the trees will be less vulnerable to storms in future,” said a horticulturalist. If some kind of protection is still required to stop people from uprooting young plants to make space for parking on pavements, Kakkar said they did not have to be metal cages that ended up doing more harm to the trees than good. Instead, she suggested the use of darma or mat woven out of bamboo strips as a protective barrier as it was biodegradable. Some of the iron guards have turned into garbage binsSeeing the plight of caged trees, Nature Mates has urged KMC and the forest department’s urban forestry division to permit it to free the trees of the shackles. “We will gladly do it for free,” said Basu Roy. “We have also found this caging turning into a menace. We have asked our officials borough-wise to take appropriate action,” said a KMC parks department official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/activists-call-for-unshackling-of-trees-from-iron-cages/articleshow/86101083.cms||Subhro Niyogi
---||Delhi||Leopard in natural habitat in Delhi's Tughlaqabad, no need to cage it, says forest department||NEW DELHI: The forest and wildlife department has said no cage will immediately be installed in Tughlaqabad, where a leopard has been caught on camera traps barely 250 metres from the south forest division’s office. Officials say while an alert has been issued in nearby residential colonies, the animal was still in its “natural” habitat. Unless it is found to be aggressive, no immediate action will be taken, they point out. Local people, however, have been asked not to venture out into the nearby forested areas even during the day. The leopard was caught on a camera trap that was being used as part of a leopard census in the area, which forest officials say is an indicator of good prey base with monkeys, jackals and nilgais. In the past, the sighting of leopards near human settlements had prompted the forest department to install cages to lure and trap the animal to release it outside the city. In February this year, a leopard sighting caught on CCTV cameras in Najafgarh led to cages being installed in the area, with a goat placed inside as a bait. In December 2016, a leopard was baited into a cage near Yamuna Biodiversity Park in north Delhi and released into the Shivalik hill ranges in Uttar Pradesh. Amit Anand, deputy conservator of forest (DCF), south, said an alert had been sounded in the adjoining areas of Sanjay Colony, Sangam Vihar and Devli. The department will also try and keep a track of the areas where the leopard is moving into. “There is no need to set up a trap or a cage at the moment. The animal is in its natural habitat and it is a positive indicator of a thriving habitat. We have issued advisories at the moment in nearby settlements and people have been asked to be careful around their homes and especially avoid forest patches,” said Anand. A senior forest official said sightings had also been made recently in Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary, where a family of leopards was set to be living. Delhi government is currently planning a green corridor for leopards near Surajkund-Pali Road near Haryana, where a leopard was found dead on June 28. In collaboration with Haryana government, the underground corridor aims to provide a safer route to leopards looking to venture into Delhi from Haryana and vice-versa.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/leopard-in-natural-habitat-no-need-to-cage-it-forest-dept/articleshow/86101678.cms||---

The PM will also address a public rally on this occasion ahead of 2022 assembly elections in the state. Deputy inspector general of police (Aligarh range), Deepak Kumar, said, “PAC, paramilitary forces will be deployed along with the state police force as per Standard Operating Procedure (SOP). ATS Commandos will also be deployed at the event venue. As over 1.5 lakh people are expected to come to the event, traffic, security, crowd and route management will also be the focus.” “Eight parking lots, including two for VIPs, have been set up. The entire parking area has been divided into 40 sectors,” he said, adding that 20 entrance gates, including five exclusive ones for women, have been set up for entry to the rally ground. Meanwhile, police have launched massive search operations in five villages which are within a 3-kilometre radius of the rally ground to check for suspicious activities. People with criminal history are also being scanned as a precautionary measure. More than six lakh square feet ground, which has the capacity to accommodate over one lakh people, will be protected by various security agencies. Last year, PM Modi had virtually attended the centenary celebrations of Aligarh Muslim University but this visit is being seen as a kick off to election rally as the state assembly polls are just a few months away.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/elaborate-security-arrangements-in-place-for-pms-aligarh-visit-on-sep-14/articleshow/86100362.cms||---

The ban will be effective from Friday night. Additional chief secretary, information department, Navneet Sehgal told TOI that besides the seven pilgrimage sites, 22 municipal wards around the temple complex will also be considered as pilgrimage sites. Three years ago, the state government had imposed the same ban in seven towns of religious significance in the district, namely, Govardhan, Baldev, Nandgaon, Radhakund, Gokul, Vrindavan and Barsana, after declaring them pilgrimage sites. The notification issued by additional chief secretary Avnish Awasthi said that lakhs of pilgrims visit Mathura-Vrindavan every year and the religious site has mythological significance and is also important in terms of tourism. Therefore, the government has declared 22 wards as pilgrimage sites. These are Ghati Bahalrai, Govind Nagar, Mandi Ramdas, Chaubiapada, Dwarikapuri, Navneet Nagar, Vankhandi, Bhartapur gate, Arjunpura, Hanuman Teela, Jagannathpuri, Gaughat, Manoharpura, Bairagpura, Radhanagar, Badrinagar, Mahavidya colony, Krishnanagar first, Krishnanagar second Koyla gali, Dampian Nagar and Jaisinghpura. Expressing happiness over declaration of more pilgrimage sites in Mathura, Kapil Sharma, secretary of Shri Krishna Janmasthan Seva Sansthan, said that this is a historic decision. “Every Krishna devotee is elated with the government’s move as these things should never be allowed in religious towns,” he said. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath had announced a ban on liquor and meat sale in Mathura during his recent visit to the district to celebrate Janmashtami. He suggested that those engaged in liquor and meat trade could take up selling milk in order to revive the glory of Mathura, which was known for producing huge quantities of milk. “Every effort will be made to develop Brij Bhumi and there will be no dearth of funds for this. We are looking at a blend of modern technology and cultural and spiritual heritage for the development of the region,” he had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/mathura-liquor-meat-ban-comes-into-force/articleshow/86100365.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) has set up artificial ponds at 24 places in the city for eco-friendly immersion. Separate arrangements have been made to collect the nirmalya (flowers). Civic chief Kadambari Balkawade has appealed to the citizens not to pollute the water bodies by immersing idols in them. She said, “As per the government guidelines, the festival will be celebrated in a low-key manner this year due to pandemic situation. We are facilitating the citizens to carry out immersion in eco-friendly way. Our staff will be on the ground. The nirmalya collected will be converted into green manure. We are hopeful of citizens following Covid appropriate behaviour during immersion.” The immersion of five-day Ganesha will be carried out on September 14. Balkawade said more immersion kunds will be set up and a workforce of 200 staff will be on the ground to facilitate immersion. The citizens will be convinced to avoid immersion into Rankala lake, Panchaganga river, Kapiltirth lake and other natural water bodies. Every year, the KMC set up idol donation centres at the natural water bodies. The idols donated at immersed with all rituals followed at Irani Quarry.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/artificial-ponds-in-24-places-in-kolhapur-city/articleshow/86099514.cms||---

A tree activist had lodged a complaint with the forest department after finding that seven trees were damaged during the excavation work undertaken by PWD. A forest official said, “After we received a complaint, our team inspected the site and found that some trees were damaged in violation of Delhi Preservation of Trees Act, 1994. We have issued a restraining order to PWD to stop the work. We are also sharing the copy of the restraining order with police to ensure that no further activity takes place at the site.” PWD officials did not respond to TOI’s queries. Verhaen Khanna, founder of New Delhi Nature Society, had complained that PWD was undertaking excavation work adjacent to the trees on Mahatma Gandhi Marg, near the Pragati Power bus station. “Due to the excavation, four trees were damaged on one side and three on the other side of the road. The roots of a few trees were exposed, while concretisation was done within one metre radius of the tree at some places. The trees have been damaged in the violation of orders of National Green Tribunal and the high court,” complained Khanna. NGT had directed all public authorities in 2013 to deconcretise areas around trees and said no construction activity would be allowed within the one metre radius of a trunk. In another case, Delhi High Court had advised PWD to be cautious during all ongoing and future work.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/restraining-orders-to-pwd-after-trees-damaged-during-trenching/articleshow/86101711.cms||---

The on-duty staff referred her to the Kamptee sub-district hospital (SDH) which is equipped. Though Rani writhed in pain, the SDH referred the case to Daga Hospital where she delivered on the floor even before a doctor or nurse could attend to her. “We stood in the waiting area outside the ward for an hour. My mother and sister informed the on-duty nurse about my worsening condition but no one came out to even check me till I delivered,” Rani told TOI. The incident left the newborn dead though the pediatrician tried resuscitation. Daga Hospital has now instituted a five-member panel to conduct an inquiry into the allegations of the Wasnik family which claimed the newborn died due to a fall. Daga Hospital medical superintendent Dr Seema Parvekar refuted the allegations and said it was a precipitated delivery which can take place anywhere – in a bus, train or plane. The incident created a controversy after a video of Rani lying on floor outside the labour ward went viral on social media. “When the pleas of my mother and sister fell on deaf ears, I walked up to the nurse and requested her to immediately take me in. I was bleeding profusely and the pain was becoming unbearable. The sister asked me to wait outside. As I was coming outside, I realized the baby’s head was protruding. Before I could lie down, it fell to the ground,” said the 27-yeard-old Rani. The video shows two nurses cleaning Rani and taking away the newborn from the spot. She too was shifted to a ward after 15 minutes. She was discharged on Thursday. Rani’s husband Sandesh approached Tehsil police with a complaint against the hospital, holding it responsible for the baby’s death. The hospital too has written to the cops, accusing the Wasniks of obstructing a government servant from discharging her duties. “The video clearly shows two nurses assisting the patient on the floor. It is called precipitated labour. A bumpy journey to the hospital could have been the trigger. She rushed to the toilet twice after arriving. Her pain too aggravated. The nurses saw this and delivered her on the spot. The baby was stillborn because it pooped in the womb. The umbilical cord was yellow, the baby was pale and had no heart beat,” said Dr Parvekar, adding, “The patient was asked to wait for the Covid test as per then norms.” Rani said the Kamptee SDH staff had told them that the umbilical cord had slipped ahead of the fetus and the head was backwards. “But they said the baby was fine. The gave us an ambulance to reach Daga Hospital,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/woman-delivers-outside-ward-at-daga-hospital/articleshow/86101675.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed
---||Agra||Uttar Pradesh: No bed, 5-year-old boy dies at Firozabad hospital||AGRA: Five-year-old Hritik, suffering from high fever, waited for over five hours at Uttar Pradesh's crowded Firozabad medical college - filled with 'mystery fever' patients from the district and parts of Agra region. With two to three patients on a single bed and many others in the queue, little Hritik couldn't get the urgent medical attention. He died, waiting, on Thursday. Photographs of his father Rajkumar, a daily wager, carrying Hrithik on his shoulder later went viral on social media. “My son died due to lack of treatment. He was suffering from high fever and vomiting blood," Rajkumar said. Rajkumar, a resident of Karbala locality, claimed that he had taken his son to a private hospital on Wednesday, where he was asked for an advance payment of Rs 40,000 to start Hritik's treatment. "I requested them to start the treatment and give me a day's time to arrange the money. But they refused." "On Thursday morning, I took my son to the medical college. Here, I waited for a bed.

The facility, which will come up in the outskirts of the city in Shankarpur, will include a cold room to store remains until the final rituals are conducted. The crematorium will be built along the lines of a similar facility that was announced in Delhi last year. The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) had announced in December last year to set up the city’s first public crematorium for dogs which will also have priests. Senior veterinary officer, DMC, Dr D C Tewari, told TOI the crematorium will not only allow a dignified farewell to the deceased animals but also end the practice of animals being buried at open spaces. “Not just pets, but even stray animals will be cremated here. It will be open to all animals and should be up and running by next month,” he said. Pet owners have welcomed the move to have a dedicated facility for cremation. Varun Shah, a resident of Race course, who recently lost his German Shepherd, said it had to be buried in a secluded spot. “We couldn’t even say a proper goodbye. Losing a dog is like losing a family member, we should be allowed to send them off with dignity,” he said. The DMC is yet to reveal the charges for the cremation and priest services. DMC officials, meanwhile, said that cases of abandonment of cattle are also on the rise in the city. “Many of these animals are dying in road accidents. Every day we receive at least five rescue calls. We are now mulling radio tags on cattle so it is hard for owners to abandon them,” a DMC official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/doon-to-get-pet-crematorium-priests-to-perform-last-rites-for-animals/articleshow/86100369.cms||Abhijeet Singh

The couple — a 17-year-old boy and a 16-year-old girl — were deboarded from Magadh Express on Friday morning following intervention from the Hindu Jagran Manch, a right-wing outfit. "Members of the Hindu Jagran Manch tried to stop the train in Tundla in Firozabad, but the Tundla railway administration did not cooperate, so they went to GRP Aligarh,” said former BJP mayor from Aligarh, Shakuntala Bharti. “I got involved because it is a case of love jihad. I can’t let this happen,” said Bharti. The GRP denied the claim and said it had received a "tip-off" about the runaway couple through a call on the control room. The couple told police they were in a relationship for the past six months and their parents were not ready to accept it. The girl has alleged that her parents were forcing her to marry someone else. The minors are in police custody and their parents have been informed to pick them up. “No complaint has been filed in the case yet,” said GRP inspector Abdul M Khan. Both families told TOI they had not filed a police complaint after the minors went missing. The girl’s brother, an undergraduate student in Buxar, told TOI she went missing on Thursday night. “We found out that our neighbour had also gone missing, but we did not file a complaint. Before we knew it, we got a call from police that she had been found. We don’t know how a right-wing organisation got involved,” he said. The boy’s brother said the minor runs a meat shop in the village. He said the family had assumed he had gone to visit a friend. “We only got to know he had run away after we got a call from UP police.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/right-wing-group-forces-minor-interfaith-couple-out-of-train/articleshow/86100378.cms||Anuja Jaiswal

The case pertains to one Bhanu Pratap, who was issued a duplicate SIM belonging to another person and transferred a total of Rs 68.5 lakh from IDBI bank to his other accounts. Later, he returned Rs 44 lakh but the victim is yet to receive the rest of the money. On May 25, 2017, Krishna Lal Nain’s Vodafone Idea mobile number stopped working. He went to the telecom company’s store in Hanumangarh and registered a complaint. Though he got a new number, it remained inactivated despite repeated complaints. In Jaipur, he went to one of the company’s stores and again submitted a complaint for SIM activation, which happened the next day. By then, the culprit had transferred Rs 68.5 lakh from Nain’s IDBI Bank account using the OTPs generated. Not only was the duplicate SIM card issued without proper verification of personal data, the delay in activation of the new SIM card and the transfer of money from the account during the period raised serious questions. Provisions in the IT Act allow the department of IT and communication to ensure justice for people who have suffered losses due to laxity by telecom firms in carrying out due diligence before issuing SIM cards. The order says that Vodafone Idea has to pay Rs 2.31lakh as interest and Rs 72,000 deposited by the applicant (Krishna Lal Nain) besides the loss money of Rs 24lakh. If the telecom company fails to pay the money within one month, 10% interest will be imposed. Vodafone Idea has the option to challenge the other in higher courts and tribunals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/pay-28-lakh-over-fraud-involving-duplicate-sim-voda-ordered/articleshow/86104212.cms||Srikanta Tripathy

The accused identified as Bharat Bawari was detained and questioned and after some hours of interrogation, he was arrested. “In the interrogation, he said that he is a native of Khedapa village in Jodhpur and three years ago through MTS examination, he was posted at Jaipur and was involved in sorting the postal letters. It was found that he got in touch with a Pakistani woman through Facebook messenger and later both had interactions with video call and voice call,” said Umesh Mishra, additional director general, intelligence. Senior officers of intelligence wing further stated that the woman introduced the man as a native of Port Blair where she claimed that after doing nursing she was preparing for MBBS. “She claimed that she wanted one of her relatives to get transferred into good Army unit near Jaipur. And that’s how she urged the accused to start sending sensitive and confidential information of the Army,” said a senior officer on the condition of anonymity. The woman also said that she will visit Jaipur and both will hang around. “The accused started sending the pictures of the confidential letters and post that was supposed to be sent to the army,” the officer added. Police have registered a case under appropriate sections of Official Secrets Act, 1923. “The accused had also purchased a simcard and shared its number and for installation of WhatsApp shared the OTP with the woman so that she can run the WhatsApp by using Indian number,” the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/honeytrap-postal-dept-employee-held-for-spying-for-pak/articleshow/86102281.cms||---
---||Dehradun||HC agrees to hear U’khand’s application seeking resumption of Char Dham Yatra||Nainital: Following frantic efforts by the Uttarakhand government to withdraw its special leave petition (SLP) from the Supreme Court (SC) and to secure a hearing before the Uttarakhand high court (HC) seeking vacation of the stay on Char Dham Yatra, the division bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma on Friday finally agreed to hear the application. This comes after the chief standing counsel (CSC), CS Rawat, appeared before the CJ’s bench and informed that the SLP has been withdrawn from the apex court and therefore, the HC can now hear the case. The bench then said that it will hear the case either on Wednesday or Thursday. As reported by TOI, the Char Dham Yatra was stayed by the court citing the pandemic situation in the country. The stay was ordered while the court was hearing a bunch of Public Interest Litigations (PILs) concerning the state’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Subsequently, the state government challenged the order in the SC arguing that the court did not consider the fact that the livelihood of thousands of people in the state depends on the yatra. However, the state failed to secure even a single hearing on the matter in the SC. This week, the government made several attempts to get the yatra started. The advocate general (AG), SN Babulkar, appeared before the HC on Tuesday seeking a hearing on the matter arguing that the Covid-19 cases have gone down in the state and that the yatra should now be started. The bench, however, said that an SLP challenging the HC’s stay is already pending before the apex court and therefore, it will issue pass any orders in the matter. Thereafter, the state withdrew the SLP. Earlier this week, a delegation of the tour and travel operators from Uttarkashi, Chamoli and Rudraprayag districts met the petitioners in the case seeking their cooperation in starting the yatra. The businessmen promised to follow all the SOPs issued by the state and the court.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/hc-agrees-to-hear-ukhands-application-seeking-resumption-of-char-dham-yatra/articleshow/86100384.cms||Prashant Jha

Leaving behind memories of Covid-19 and the recent flooding, citizens as well as Ganesh mandals from the city thronged areas such as Gangawesh, Shahupuri and Bapat Camp Kumbhar gallis to carry the idols of their beloved Elephant God home. The chants of ‘Ganapati Bappa Moryaa, Ganesh Ganesh Morya’ echoed across various neighbourhood in the city. Most of the people preferred creative idols that portrayed a social message. Keeping the celebrations environmentally-friendly was also a top priority for most citizens. Nikhil Patil, who was seen carrying an eco-friendly Ganapati idol in Shahupuri Kumbhar galli, shared, “We have been bringing home a clay idol of Dagdusheth Ganesh since the last three years. The satisfaction of making a contribution towards keeping the environment clean is priceless. Other people should also opt for celebrating Ganeshotsav in an eco-friendly manner.” Covid-19 safety protocols, such as maintaining social distance and wearing a mask, seemed to go for a toss in the city. A number of people were seen carrying the Ganapati idols home without wearing a mask or following social distancing norms. Even though the police had banned anyone from organising a procession, several Ganesh pandals took out rallies with dhol-tasha and lezim groups.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/flooding-covid-19-worries-take-a-backseat-for-now/articleshow/86099527.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

In her early seventies, Durgaben (name changed) had been living on a liquid diet for the past four months after she contracted mucormycosis which had ravaged more than half her face. On Friday, she underwent surgery to fix her denture consisting of palate, upper jaw and teeth. “I am having solid food after four months. Without teeth, it was very difficult to chew. Moreover, liquid food would sometimes come out of the nostrils, making it a very uncomfortable situation,” recounted the Durgaben, a resident of north Gujarat. Dr Kiran Patel, a city-based oral and maxillofacial surgeon, said that she had contracted Covid infection during the first wave. “It was a severe infection, following which she contracted mucormycosis due to her several health-related issues. To save her, the surgeons had to remove her upper jaw, palate and teeth. It was not only a functional difficulty, but also a painful experience for her as her entire facial structure went awry,” he said. He said that he and his team has performed several facial reconstruction surgeries this year after the second wave. “What made this surgery particularly difficult was the fact that there were few tissues on which we could mount the prosthetics. We eventually took support of the remains of her nose and upper jaw and designed it. It fitted perfectly and now she will be able to lead a normal life,” said Dr Patel. “But the prosthetics will need regular cleaning.” City experts said that after MM, patients are advised at least three months’ window to get their internal tissues stabilized. “The recovered patients have now started coming for facial reconstruction and prosthetic surgeries. The number is likely to rise in upcoming days,” said a city-based surgeon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/surgery-helps-mm-patient-eat-solid-food/articleshow/86101110.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Viral pneumonia strikes children in Covid times||KOLKATA: Ahead of the potential third wave, many children are already in hospital with viral pneumonia infection, taking up PICU (paediatric intensive care unit) beds with some needing ventilation support. Most PICU beds in different hospitals in the city are now being currently occupied by children suffering from viral pneumonia. Viral pneumonia is a virus-triggered infection that causes inflammation of the lungs. “Half of our 14 bedded PICU is occupied by children suffering from viral pneumonia, four of whom are under ventilation support,” said Institute of Child Health (ICH) associate professor of paediatrics Prabhas Prasun Giri, also PICU in-charge. Doctors said that influenza Ã both A and B, RSV, metapneumovirus, para influenza virus — is causing the problem. A good number of the affected children are requiring very intensive care support, including ventilation. The paediatric unit at the state-run Medical College Hospital Kolkata (MCHK) has seen 30-plus such cases in the last one month, more than half in the PICU. “Though we so far have managed the cases successfully there had been a couple of really difficult cases, including a case where the infection had severely affected the lungs.” said MCHK associate professor of paediatrics Mihir Sarkar, PICU in-charge. Due to the confusing symptom with Covid, swab samples are also being tested but these children are reportedly testing negative to SARS-Cov-2. “Normally we get maximum cases in winter months. Such cases are sporadic in monsoons. But this time the number is unusually high,” said Sarkar. AMRI Mukundapur paediatric intensivist Soumen Meur said while children usually would get mild illness this time around, doctors are seeing more severe cases. “This time we are getting a case of very bad influenza. In fact we have a two year old child who currently is battling under ECMO support. This is the reason parents should get their children the flu shots,” said Meur.  “Among the very sick kids we are dealing with right now is a two-year-old boy whose brain has been affected, a very rare complication of Influenza B infection. He was brought 10 days ago in such a critical condition that he was put on ventilation straightaway,” said paediatrician Sumita Saha Fortis Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/viral-pneumonia-strikes-children-in-covid-times/articleshow/86101103.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: New Town resistance group helps cops nab 2 for harassing women||KOLKATA: Less than a week since the formation of a resistance group in New Town — meant to enhance women safety — two men were nabbed by cops following an alert from a group member. The two men had allegedly teased two young women walking back home at BC Block in New Town on Thursday night. Around 10.15pm on Thursday, two women in their 20s were walking home along a fairly desolate stretch of New Town Street no 131 when two youths allegedly teased and passed lewd remarks at them. The men were labourers, who were unloading sand from a truck parked along the road. “We were walking back home after completing a Durga Puja community programme rehearsal, when the two men began passing lewd remarks and taunting us. We shouted back but they started using slang as we retreated,” said one of the women. While the incident was happening, five men — volunteers on evening shift — were taking a round of the area. They learnt about the incident from the women and rushed to the spot. While one of them called the local police station, others started keeping the accused persons engaged in conversation and clicked photographs and sent it to the local police station’s officer-in-charge, along with a google location of the area as instructed. “The cops were quick to act. I had called the police around 10.15pm and they were at the spot within 10 minutes. The two men were put into a police vehicle and taken out by 10.30pm,” said Soumyadip Maity, a 35-year-old techie and one of the volunteers. Formed last week, the resistance group members are tasked to patrol areas near their homes or as assigned by the cops, while doing their morning and evening walks. They have been asked to alert cops whenever they notice something suspicious or illegal, without intervening physically. The two labourers, residents of Rajarhat, were arrested under prohibitory sections but later released on bail after the women decided against lodging an FIR. “We learnt the two youths were not dreaded criminals and this was their first offence. The arrest would have ruined their careers and so we decided to give them a second chance,” said one of the victims.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/new-town-resistance-group-helps-cops-nab-two-for-harassing-women/articleshow/86101129.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

---||Pune||Pune district’s Covid positivity rate below 5%, coming week crucial: Collector||PUNE: Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh on Friday said the weekly positivity rate (WPR) in the district was below 5% at present but the next week’s case data would be crucial because of the ongoing Ganesh festivities. The district’s WPR for the seven-day period from September 2 to 9 was 3.6%. While it was 2.5% in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) areas, it was 3% in the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) limits and 4.6% in the Pune rural areas. The district’s rural areas continued to be in focus because of the higher WPR than the district’s average. Deshmukh said more tests were being conducted in those areas. Teams had been sent to ensure that Covid protocols were followed strictly and there was no crowding, he said. The daily tests for the district touched 30,000 this week, crossing the 10,000-daily mark in the rural areas. “Residents should follow the Covid protocol guidelines during the festive period. Ganesh mandals, too, have been told to follow the same,” Deshmukh said. The district’s WPR was 6.33% in the note prepared for the cabinet earlier this week — almost double than its actual WPR of 3.6%. Health officials claimed that the discrepancy in data continued because laboratories were not prompt in entering Covid negative test report data. “Positive reports are entered on time because the laboratories know they would otherwise face action or even termination,” said a health official. Of the total 104 laboratories in Pune district, most are concentrated in the PMC and PCMC areas. The local administration has now directed the laboratories to enter their Covid negative reports on time. Pimpri Chinchwad municipal commissioner Rajesh Patil said he has directed the laboratories in his jurisdiction to complete the data entry at the earliest or face action. “I will be sending out a team to all laboratories to ensure that data entry is completed so that there is no discrepancy in the district data shared here and on the state portal,” he said. Pune municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar, too, said he had directed the laboratories in his jurisdiction not to delay the data the entry of both positive and negative Covid test reports.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/punes-wpr-below-5-focus-on-following-covid-protocols-in-festive-week-dist-collector/articleshow/86101736.cms||Nisha Nambiar

These include a monthly Covid incentive of Rs 1,000 promised by the Centre and a newly announced monthly hike of Rs 3,000 by the Maharashtra government. These health workers, known as Asha, also get incentives based or calculated on various sundry jobs that they do in a month. “We aim to take the statewide strike of these workers across the country on September 24,” said MA Patil, president, Maharashtra Rajya Gatapravartak Ani Ashaswayamsevika Sangha — a statewide union of Asha workers. “We didn’t get the hiked payment of Rs 2,000 from April 2021 onward and payment of additional Rs 1,000 from July 2021. Besides, the Centre also stopped paying us Rs 1,000 Covid incentive from April this year,” Patil said.

---||Bareilly||‘Editor’ of news portal held for impersonating an IAS officer||Bareilly: Kiran Kumar Singh Chandel, 53, claimed that he was a senior IAS officer of the MP cadre when he called the SHO of Jalalabad in Shahjahanpur, telling him not to raid the house of a rape accused. When the latter brought the matter to the notice of his superiors, it turned out that SSP S Anand had also received a call from Chandel. Suspicious that something was amiss, the SSP had already ordered the surveillance team to trace the call. The calls were traced to Jalalabad area. The SHO of Jalalabad was sent to the location, where Chandel and his accomplice, Pravesh Kashyap. were arrested. “We have charged them under IPC sections 417 (cheating), 170 (personating a public servant) and 419 (cheating by impersonation),” SSP Anand said. During questioning, Chandel told police that he is an IITian and claimed to be the editor of a Lucknow-based news portal. He was staying with a relative in Jalalabad. Both were arrested. When TOI questioned him, Chandel claimed that he was under the influence when he made the calls. Chandel’s call records revealed that he had also made calls to Shahjahanpur’s DM Indra Vikram Singh, Pilibhit DM Pulkit Khare and many other officials, posing as a “senior IAS officer”, seeking favours. The SSP told TOI, “Chandel called on my phone and introduced himself as additional chief secretary, home in Madhya Pradesh and sought favours. Since he didn’t sound genuine, I cross-questioned him. He claimed that he was calling from Bhopal. But the surveillance team tracked his mobile location to Jalalabad area.” Shahjahanpur DM Indra Vikram Singh said, “The same person called me on multiple occasions and said he is a retired IAS officer. He once asked me to book a guest house and on another occasion, he said he was launching a newspaper and requested me to clear his file. I suspected that this person was not genuine, so I didn’t entertain his requests.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/editor-of-news-portal-held-for-impersonating-an-ias-officer/articleshow/86100411.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

She wrote to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, besides talking to him on the phone, and urged him to ensure relief measures for the flood victims. Nandgaon taluka received 126mm of rain of 126mm late Tuesday evening, following which water from the Lendi and Shakambari rivers started overflowing and caused extensive damage to property.

The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has to achieve the targeted capacity of 150 metric tonnes of oxygen per day. At present, the overall generation is 28.3 tonnes less compared to the goal. The dura cylinders’ procurement aims at completing the target. “A review of the present availability and future demand of oxygen was done, following which we decided to buy these cylinders,” said Ravindra Binwade, the additional municipal commissioner of Pune. According to the civic officials, the daily need for consumption of oxygen is around 47 metric tonnes. The state authorities have given instructions to prepare the infrastructure for nearly three times of the requirements. The PMC is setting up infrastructure for 150 metric tonnes of oxygen. The civic body has 8,400 litre per minute (LPM) capacity for supply. It will be increased by 5,400 LPM in the coming days and the plants for the same would be constructed, an official said. Oxygen plants have been set up at the Naidu hospital and Laygude hospital using civic and corporate social responsibility funds.

The girl later gave birth to a child. The convict, Jagmaan Singh, a resident of Bareilly district, had eloped with a 15-year-old girl, the daughter of his neighbour, in 2009. He was found a year later. Already married and father of a child, Singh was booked under sections of IPC and under the POCSO Act. The court proceedings in this case started in 2014. But after a period of time, the minor girl’s family accepted her marriage with Singh and allowed them to live together. All the witnesses turned hostile and gave statements in favour of Jagmaan, barring the father of Jagmaan’s first wife. Additional district government counsel Santosh Srivastava told TOI, “The judgement was announced by additional district and sessions judge (ADJ) Nirdosh Kumar. The statement of Jagmaan’s first wife’s father played a pivotal role in the judgement in this case. The main complainants had turned hostile and changed their statements during trials. But the court still convicted the accused Jagmaan for marrying and making sexual relationship with a minor. A cash fine of Rs 20,000 has also been slapped on the accused. The court has also termed his first marriage ‘null and void’.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/man-gets-9-years-in-jail-for-marrying-minor-girl/articleshow/86100415.cms||Kanwardeep Singh
---||Goa||Joao Aranha, man who set up GFA, dies in Portugal at 98||Panaji: Goa’s opening Lusofonia Games 2009 clash against Mozambique had an unexpected visitor at the Estadio Luis Gomes in Lisbon. It was Lt. Joao Luis Aranha, the founder president of the Goa Football Association (GFA), and he was seeing the team for the first time in almost 50 years. Ever since he was told that the Goan football team were scheduled to play the opening game, Aranha, despite advancing age, couldn’t stop himself from watching them play. “It’s so nice to watch Goa play here (in Lisbon). They are a good team,” Aranha told officials from the Sports Authority of Goa, which included Goa’s football hero Bruno Coutinho. Aranha died at his home in Cascais on Thursday. He was 98. “Sporting Clube de Portugal expresses its regret for the death of Joao Aranha, former vice-president of the Alvalade emblem, who died last Wednesday at 98 years of age,” the club said in a statement on its website. Aranha was vice president at Sporting Clube between 1975 and 1978. He was also founder president of Liga Portugal and led Lisbon Football Association and CUF. In Goa, he will be remembered as the man who lobbied with the Portuguese government for permission to form an autonomous organisation to manage the affairs of football in Goa. Till December 22, 1959, it was the Conselhos de Desportos da India that governed sports in Goa. But football’s growing popularity meant it needed a separate organisation. That organisation was Associacao Futebol de Goa, now GFA, and Aranha, a commander with the Portuguese police, was its first president. Dr Gustavo Monteiro was the vice president, while Peter Furtado was appointed secretary of the managing committee. “It was not easy during the colonial rule to separate football from the rest of Goan sporting life, since all the directions of sports were issued from Lisbon and were the same for all the colonies. But we succeeded, thanks to great enthusiasm, a total surrender to the cause of Goan football and unity of efforts which I am very proud to be part of,” Aranha wrote in his message to GFA on its 40th anniversary in 1999. Goa became the first and only colony that was granted the special privilege of having a separate association to govern a sport. Even when the Premeira Divisao or first division was started in 1951, the league was under the control of the Conselhos de Desportos da India. Aranha spent six years in Goa during the Portuguese rule and was forced to leave after Goa’s Liberation on December 19, 1961. He described his time here as the “best years of my life.” When he left Goa, among his belongings, Aranha packed the GFA flag and took it with him to Portugal. The flag was returned to the then GFA secretary Agnelo Alcasoas when he visited Lisbon and met the founder president in 1998. “I shall never be able to forget the time which I spent among the good people of Goa, chiefly people of the football fraternity, with whom I had more contact,” said Aranha who was invited for the 40-year celebrations but couldn’t make it due to old age.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/joao-aranha-man-who-set-up-gfa-dies-in-portugal-at-98/articleshow/86126499.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Delhi||Venture that hit air pocket, made Delhi Metro sway||NEW DELHI: When Delhi Metro’s Airport Express opened to the public a decade ago, the standalone corridor was also the first public-private partnership undertaken by Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, with 46% of the construction costs borne by the concessionaire and 39% by the central and Delhi governments. The Centre’s new policy now makes private participation essential either for complete provisioning of metro rail or for unbundled components like automatic fare collection, operation and maintenance of services. DMRC’s first brush with the PPP model, however, saw disagreements within a few years of the concession agreement being signed. A long legal battle followed, concluding only on Thursday when a two-judge bench of the Supreme Court dismissed DMRC’s plea and upheld a 2017 arbitration tribunal order requiring the train company to pay Delhi Airport Metro Express Private Limited (DAMEPL), a subsidiary of Reliance Infrastructure, Rs 2,800 crore plus interest, a sum that adds up to Rs 4,600 crore. In August 2008, DMRC and DAMEPL agreed that all civil work would be carried out by the corporation while the latter would provide the trains, power supply, signalling, track system, platform, screen doors, etc. The partnership was undertaken to meet the deadline of having the corridor running by the time the Commonwealth Games opened in Delhi in October 2010. However, the work wasn’t finished and operations started only on February 23, 2011. Within a month, DAMEPL requested DMRC to conduct a joint inspection of the viaduct and its bearings before expiry of the defect liability period of the civil contractors, complaining about the design and quality of the viaduct bearings. DMRC responded that in inspections of the locations specified by DAMEPL, no bearings were found damaged, but admitted to some defects requiring speed restrictions. DAMEPL terminated the agreement in October 2012, arguing that the defects pointed out in July hadn’t been rectified within 90 days. Train services remained suspended between July 2012 and January 2013 before DMRC took over the operations in July 2013. While DMRC invoked the arbitration clause of the agreement, it also took steps to promote the corridor and increased the average daily ridership of around 10,000 to more than 14,000 by July 2014. The company introduced a slew of measures to popularise the line, including slashing fares by 40% and raising the frequency of the trains from once every 15 minutes to every 10. Other measures included resumption of city check-in counters and seamless integration with the Dwarka Sector 21 Delhi Metro station, resulting in an increase of traffic not destined for the airport but beyond it to Dwarka. The fares were again halved and to reduce expenditures, staff requirement was reduced. Ridership on the corridor kept increasing. In fact, when fare hikes affected footfall on the other corridors in 2017, the Airport Express Line bucked the trend, with average daily ridership recording 50,000 and then nearly 55,000 by the end of that year. When Covid halted operations last year, the corridor’s ridership was around 60,000. Currently, with the restrictions in place, the passenger number is around 30,000 daily.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-dmrc-brought-airport-line-back-on-track-after-taking-over-ops-from-damepl-in-2013/articleshow/86101773.cms||Sidharatha Roy

The DRM, who took the charge of the office about a month ago, was on his maiden tour of the Ghoti-Manmad section of the Bhusawal division of Central Railway on Thursday, when he inspected the cleanliness and other issues at the railway stations. The senior railway officer visited Nashik Road railway station and appreciated the cleanliness at the location. Further, Kedia asked the engineering staff to expedite the work on the escalator being installed on platform 2 and 3. The DRM said that the works carried out at the station, including the sewage treatment plant (STP), had been undertaken by the railways as part of several eco-friendly measures. The officer visited the VIP lounge that has been constructed recently but expressed concern over the barricading, which has cut down the access to the lounge. Kedia asked the local authorities to find out ways and means of allowing easy access to the VIP lounge. The senior officer also asked the authorities to ensure that none of the beggars and unauthorized vendors were allowed to enter the station premises under any circumstance. The Central Railways is slowly and steadily increasing the numbers of trains running across the country. Multiple entries at Nashik Road railway station have already been curtailed and are being monitored. The railway authorities have constructed boundary walls along the tracks, but they are limited to the length of the platforms. There are people, who enter the tracks from areas where the boundaries end, and then walk to the station. The DRM has asked authorities to ensure that this movement of people is restricted and discouraged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/bhusawal-drm-seeks-quick-completion-of-escalator-work/articleshow/86099605.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kolkata||Kolkata celebrates muted Ganesh Chaturthi with Covid rules in place||KOLKATA: Devotees across Kolkata celebrated Ganesh Chaturthi on Friday amidst the Covid-19 pandemic for second year in a row. Traditional fervour of the festival was on display at Shree Siddhivinayak mandir near Tala Post Office in north Kolkata and Maharashtra Nivas on Hazra Road. Pandals across the city reverberated with the chants of Ganpati Bappa Morya amidst prayers for health, wealth and prosperity. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee paid a visit to Maharashtra Nivas after filing her nomination for the Bhowanipore assembly by-election to offer prayers. The Ganesh Chaturthi organised by Maharashtra Mandal is one of the oldest in Kolkata, celebrated since 1930. “The chief minister comes here every year to offer prayers,” said Nandita Gadre of Maharashtra Mandal. While most Ganesh Pujas in the city are observed for only three days, the one at Maharashtra Nivas is celebrated for all 10 days. This year several housing complexes and block committees too started their own Ganesh Puja as Covid-19 safety guidelines prevent people from crowding community Pujas. Keeping the pandemic situation in mind, the committees arranged for online darshan, packed bhog and separate seating arrangements for the elderly. Ganesh Puja gained prominence in Kolkata in the past decade or so when it became a permanent neighbourhood event with several traders’ associations, clubs and politicians starting their own puja to establish connect with the mass. In Bangur, an NGO that works with the visually impaired and other specially abled people organised Ganesh Puja for the first time. “This is the first time we have organised the Puja. For the last one-and-a-half-years everybody have been depressed with hardly any opportunities to celebrate and interact with the outer world,” said Debajyoti Roy, secretary of the NGO.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-celebrates-muted-ganesh-chaturthi-with-cov-rules-in-place/articleshow/86101139.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||India||Kashmir problems a legacy of Gandhi family and Cong's politics of appeasement: BJP||NEW DELHI: BJP on Friday slammed Rahul Gandhi for accusing the party and RSS of “trying to break the composite culture of Jammu and Kashmir” and said the region’s problems are rooted in the ‘legacy of the Gandhi family’ and Congress’ politics of appeasement. Reacting to Rahul Gandhi’s statement in Jammu a day after visiting the Vaishno Devi shrine that he too was a Kashmiri Pandit and he was pained by the plight of the Kashmiris and Kashmiri Pandit, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said the Congress leader had “conveniently forgotten that the woes of the Kashmiri Pandits were because of the ‘politics of appeasement’” of Congress and like-minded parties. “There was a time when at the behest of the Gandhi family, the then PM Manmohan Singh even hugged separatist leaders,” Patra said and added, “The problems of Jammu & Kashmir are the legacy of the Gandhi family.” The BJP spokesperson said it was Jawaharlal Nehru who was responsible for the problems of Kashmir. “Abrogation of Article 370 did away with the discriminations against Women, Dalits and refugees of Kashmir,” he added. Patra said ironically when Home Minister Amit Shah was discussing about abrogation of Article 370, Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary called it a bilateral matter. “This is the real nature of the Congress Party .. shedding crocodile tears while it destroyed Kashmir during its tenure,” he said. He also said the Congress leader had hurt the sentiments of Hindus and Sikhs across the world and should apologise to the two communities for certain remarks he made after visiting the shrine. “Rahul Gandhi after visiting the Maa Vaishno Devi Shrine played with the sentiments of the Hindus as well by saying that the powers of Goddess Durga, Saraswati and Lakshmi have decreased after Modi ji came to power. He also said the hand of Congress is the hand of Wahe Guru,” he said. The BJP leader said Rahul Gandhi had the audacity of comparing GST with Mother Lakshmi while in the past he had compared it Gabbar Singh, the villain in the iconic Bollywood film ‘Sholay’. “This is unforgivable. Rahul has yet again done what he’s best at …immaturity and irresponsibility,” Patra said||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/kashmir-problems-a-legacy-of-gandhi-family-and-congs-politics-of-appeasement-bjp/articleshow/86104539.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Tour operators offer Covid-wary citizens ‘safe and less-travelled destinations’ in Kolkata||KOLKATA: Banking on a wave of “revenge tourism”—after being confined to their homes, people leaving on trips in droves as Covid cases rise slowly—16 Indian states are participating in an annual travel and tourism fair in Kolkata with tour operators ready to showcase “offbeat, isolated and less-travelled destinations” in their schemes and packages, assuring clients of safety from the virus. Doctors, however, cautioned against non-essential travels.  “Of late, queries have been pouring in and a large number of travellers from Bengal have been visiting places across the country. After a dull 2020, all major destinations are already booked for the Pujas. The extension of Air India’s London flight till March, resumption of Bangladesh flights and flights to Port Blair resuming from next week will help,” said Anil Punjabi, chairman (east), Travel Agents Federation of India. He attended TTF Kolkata, the three-day travel and trade fair being held at Netaji Indoor Stadium from Friday. Representatives of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand said precautions were being taken to protect locals. “We are allowing only tourists with either double vaccination or Covid-negative reports to ensure safety for locals.  Tourists are not opting for the usual destinations, like Shimla, Manali and Dalhousie but are opting for lesser travelled roads, like Kalpa and Kinnaur in Himachal Pradesh,” said Ankush Sud, senior manager, Himachal Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation. Vivek Singh Chauhan, additional director for Uttarakhand Tourism Development Board, said the state had witnessed 20% growth in tourists from Bengal this year. “Homestays have become popular after pandemic struck as people have become more concerned about sharing common space.  Off-beat places near Nainital and Mussoorie are receiving a number of tourists,” he said. Sanjiv Agarwal, chairman and CEO of Fairfest Media, the organisers of the fair said TTF highlighted the need to restart promotion. But doctors cautioned against congregation, careless behaviour and migration between two waves. “I advise people not to indulge in non-essential travel and if they must, they should wear masks and follow safety norms,” said virologist Rahul Jain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/tour-operators-offer-cov-wary-citizens-safe-and-less-travelled-destinations/articleshow/86101163.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee
---||Delhi||Bitter lesson: Pandemic takes a toll on Tihar inmates’ education||NEW DELHI: The pandemic has had an impact on the education of inmates as enrolment in different courses has declined inside prisons. According to statistics provided by the prisons authority, in 2018-19, 1,365 inmates were enrolled in 18 degree and diploma courses. In 2019-20, the enrolment figure increased to 1,682 at the Tihar study centre. In 2020-21, when the pandemic hit Delhi, only 765 inmates enrolled in the courses. In 2020-21, 37 inmates enrolled in undergraduate courses, four in postgraduate, 720 in certificate courses and four in postgraduate diploma. An official said in 2020 about 6,740 inmates were released on interim bail or emergency parole. “There was a breakdown in the continuity of their education. Inmates were studying regularly, but due to the pandemic classes were closed. Most inmates who were enrolled with Ignou were released. After getting emergency parole or interim bail, they lost focus on education,” added the official. Before Covid-19, inmates used to study in a hall and were provided study materials. “NGOs and jail staffers helped inmates in educational activities. After the Covid-19 outbreak, our study centre was closed. Because of precautionary measures, no outsiders, including representatives of NGOs, were allowed inside the prison,” said the official. Subsequently, inmates had to study in their barracks and were not allowed to visit the library or go to the classroom. “Their examinations were postponed. They can give their exams later, but there was learning loss due to Covid-19,” the official said. In 2021, 4,337 inmates were released as a part of the prison decongestion drive. Sandeep Goel, director general (prisons) confirmed that some examinations were postponed and some cancelled due to Covid-19. “The pandemic had an impact on various activities in the jail, including the studies of inmates. It will take some time to bring back continuity, but we are making all efforts,” he added. Another official said examinations were held this year after a delay. The data showed that last year 122 inmates and 293 staffers tested positive for the virus and two deaths were reported. This year, 616 inmates and staffers were infected and eight died.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bitter-lesson-pandemic-takes-a-toll-on-inmates-education/articleshow/86101778.cms||Abhay Singh

The accused sustained a bullet injury in his leg and was taken to hospital in an ambulance when he tried to run away from police custody after biting the ear of a police constable. Indrapal Kushwaha, 35, had brutally murdered his neighbour Ramkrishna Kushwaha and his wife Guddi Devi. Indrapal, a divorcee, was a family friend of Ramkrishna and used to often visit their house. He had an extramarital affair with Guddi and had left his wife for her. Later, Guddi also severed his relationship with him due to family pressure. On April 1, Ramkrishna came to know about their affair and after a brief argument, he asked Indrapal to stay away from his wife. On the same night, Indrapal returned drunk and shot the couple from a point-blank range before escaping. Kheri SSP Vijay Dhull had formed multiple teams to nab the accused, but they didn’t find success until September 9 when police got a tip-off that he was hiding in the forest area near Mohammadi. The SSP told TOI, “After getting a tip-off, we immediately sent two teams to search for Indrapal. While teams were combing in the area, Indrapal opened fire at the officials and then police opened fire in retaliation and Indrapal was injured by a police bullet and surrendered. He was carrying a cash reward of Rs 25,000 as he had been absconding for over five months.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/murder-accused-hurt-in-encounter-bites-cops-ear-tries-to-flee-from-ambulance/articleshow/86100453.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

---||Delhi||Forced to dip into reserves, Rs 4,600cr award a fresh blow||New Delhi: For Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, which is reeling under a massive financial crisis caused by the Covid-19 outbreak, the arbitral award of over Rs 4,600 crore is a body blow. On Thursday, the Supreme Court upheld the arbitral award plus interest to be paid to Delhi Airport Metro Express Private Limited with which DMRC had entered into a concessionaire agreement for the standalone metro corridor. Though DMRC didn’t comment on its course of action, sources said its legal department was analysing the Supreme Court's order. The corporation’s finance department is also brainstorming on ways to meet the new obligation. “The Hon'ble Supreme Court has pronounced judgment in the Airport Metro Express line matter today and the appeal of DAMEPL has been allowed,” accepted Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), DMRC. “The judgment is being analysed to determine a future course of action.” According to sources, DMRC has no option but to seek the central government's help, given its present financial woes. However, its earlier pleas for financial assistance from the Centre and the state governments of Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh hadn’t elicited a positive response. Covid shut down Delhi Metro’s operations for 169 days. It resumed operations only with anti-infection norms in place, including a reduced carrying capacity. The pandemic resulted in its annual revenue dipping massive by 77%, from Rs 3,897.3 crore in 2019-20 to Rs 895.9 crore in 2020-21. While DMRC had a surplus of Rs 758 crore in 2019-20, the last fiscal saw DMRC confronting a deficit of Rs 1,784.9 crore. The first quarter of the current fiscal coincided with the second Covid wave, which closed train services for 48 days. It is now operating with stricter social distancing regulations, leading to longer queues outside its stations and a steeper slide in its daily earnings. DMRC has been leaning on revenue it had earned through consultancy services rendered to other metro networks in India and abroad, but the coffers are depleting. The company is also taking measures to cut costs without affecting the operations and safety-related expenditure, and has deferred non-essential and non-safety-related maintenance work. Air-conditioning and lighting costs have also been reduced. The shutdowns and the dip in footfall due to restrictions have also affected revenue generated from property development, retail, parking, etc. Dialogue and Development Commission of Delhi, a think tank of Delhi government, was directed by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in November 2017 to examine the Airport Express Line project. It prepared a report on the manner in which the PPP project was conceived, executed and administered and alleged that changes were made in the project that were out of the scope of terms originally agreed upon. This, it said, caused a loss of Rs 4,700 crore to the public exchequer. DMRC had refused to comment on the report. According to the report, while drafting the agreement on the Airport Express Line, the model concession agreement prepared by the Planning Commission for a PPP was not followed completely, which resulted in the safeguards provided in the model agreement being eliminated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/forced-to-dip-into-reserves-rs-4600cr-award-a-fresh-blow/articleshow/86101783.cms||Sidharatha Roy

He was allegedly slapped, beaten up, dragged through the street and his head slammed on the road. He died on his way to a hospital. Eight men have been booked for murder and rioting, and the main accused arrested. Sameer was the sole earning member of his family, looking after his mother, two minor brothers and an elder sister, after his father, Rahil, a labourer, died two years ago. Sameer was on his way home on Thursday evening when the incident was reported. “Our kid got off the bus at the stand. About eight men were around. His arm brushed against one of theirs. They hurled abuses at him. That escalated,” said his uncle Adil. A member of the nagar panchayat of Banat, Ikram Ali, said, “From what I found out, the main accused, Vatan Raj, and Sameer had a heated argument.” Adil’s complaint to the police, on the basis of which an FIR was lodged at the Adarsh Mandi police station, said, “They beat him up with sticks and iron rods, and then slammed his head on the road over and over ... When they thought he was dead, they ran away.” Shamli SP Sukirti Madhav said, “He was taken to the Shamli community health centre, from where he was referred to Muzaffarnagar. He died on the way … The deceased and the accused knew one another and lived in the same area.” Adil named eight people who allegedly beat Sameer to death in his complaint — Vatan, Vardan, Akshay, Raj, Ashish, Lucky, Chintu and Bhonda. “Vatan has been arrested. We are trying to get hold of the seven others,” SP Madhav said. Police are going over CCTV footage from the bus stand and nearby areas to identify those who killed Sameer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/mechanic-20-beaten-to-death-by-mob-at-up-bus-stand-8-booked-for-murder/articleshow/86100487.cms||Mohd Dilshad
---||Delhi||Fake cancer drugs racket trail leads cops to Karnal||New Delhi: The investigation done by Delhi Police in a fake cancer drugs racket has led to a manufacturing unit of such medicines in Karnal. Investigators said they were verifying leads that apart from several states across the country, fake medicine consignments were also sent to another country. TOI was the first to report on Thursday that three people, including an M Pharma degree holder, had been arrested from Jasola Vihar with a consignment of spurious medication meant for the treatment of cancer patients. During further investigation, an advocate was also arrested. The accused were identified as Saddam Hussain Rajaa Ansari (29), who holds the M Pharma degree, Amit Dua (advocate), Sonu Chaudhary (arts graduate) and Afsar Ansari. “To make easy money, they started the illegal business of making spurious cancer medicines,” an investigator said. Investigators told TOI that they were probing the role of a few Delhi-based doctors and a man living in Kolkata. “Cancer medicines manufactured in Bangladesh are cheaper than Indian medicines. Earlier these accused, with the help of their associate in Kolkata, used to buy these drugs from the grey market,” the official said. According to him, to earn more profit, they eventually set up the manufacturing unit in Karnal and started preparing fake medicines. “When we reached the spot in Karnal, we saw that the unit was running in a modified structure. In the front part, Dua had built his advocate chamber. When we went inside, we saw machines, which were used to make fake medicines,” the investigator said, adding that another raid was conducted in Faridabad. “We have seized printing and drugs manufacturing machines, 141 packs of spurious life-saving cancer drugs such as Palbocent-125 mg, Lenvanix-10, Osicent-80mg, Crizocent-250mg and Ibrucent-140,” the official said. Further probe revealed that the demand for medicines manufactured in Bangladesh was high in comparison to similar medicines made in India. “The accused encashed the opportunity and started manufacturing spurious lifesaving medicines,” the official said. After manufacturing, these medicines were sold in the grey market at exorbitant prices. “The accused have set up a network of individuals who supply the injections on demand. A few individuals are involved in this racket of manufacturing and supplying spurious lifesaving cancer drugs and playing with the valuable lives of innocent people. The gang used to operate across India,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/fake-cancer-drugs-racket-trail-leads-cops-to-karnal/articleshow/86101789.cms||---

Chandwad taluka health officer Dr Pankaj Thakre said that 436 women benefitted from the special camp organised on a single day. He added that the aim was to provide vaccination for women only as they tend to be neglected in the family for various reasons. “Generally, vaccination takes a lot of time, about three hours, as there are long queues outside vaccination centres. In a number of cases, the women cannot spend so much of time given that they have responsibilities back home. Hence, usually only male members of the family end up getting the vaccination. Therefore, a special camp was organised for women,” the health officer said. The camp was organised at the Zilla Parishad school in Vadalibhoi, a central location in the taluka, and an awareness campaign was carried out in various villages so that maximum number of women would benefit. As many as 458 women, largely in the age-group of 30 to 55 years, were vaccinated at the camp, which was open to all women above 18 years of age. “The response was overwhelming. We will continue to hold such camps in different parts of the taluka so that the vaccination among women picks up,” the officer added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/exclusive-camp-for-women-beneficiaries-at-chandwad/articleshow/86099620.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Ahmedabad||‘Japanese companies may invest at Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit’||AHMEDABAD: Japanese automobile companies may commit investments in the upcoming Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit (VGGS) which is expected to be held in January 2022, said Yasukata Fukahori, consul general of Japan in Mumbai. He was in Ahmedabad on Friday to kick start the guided viewing experience of the Japanese Zen Garden and Kaizen Academy at Ahmedabad Management Association (AMA). Optimistic about a positive long-term outlook for Japanese investments in Gujarat and India, Fukahori said that investments are likely to pour into the state during the VGGS in automobile manufacturing. “Big automobile companies have already invested in Gujarat and may be looking for second or third phase of investments. However, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) companies such as auto ancillary units may consider entering India and Gujarat,” said the consul general of Japan in Mumbai. Fukahori also said that ‘China+1’ strategy adopted by manufacturers world over could drive investments into India. “Because of Covid-19, there was no movement on the investment front. Many companies are looking for new manufacturing bases after China. Some companies including those from Japan will therefore come to India because it is a promising market for the future, especially after Covid-19. Compared to other states in India, Gujarat is taking the lead to attract foreign investments thanks to the promotional efforts by the state government to promote the state,” he said. While the long-term outlook for Japanese investments in Gujarat and India is positive, Fukahori also maintained that Japanese automobile firms may be forced to take tough decisions in the short-term amid the Covid-19 pandemic. “In the long-term over the next 10-20 years, business relations between Japan and India will definitely grow and the focus will be on increasing and improving production. However, after Covid-19, companies may have to take tough decisions in the short-term,” said Fukahori, adding that it may affect employment. When asked whether downsizing production will impact employment, he said, “There are many labour problems faced by companies due to Covid-19. Individual companies have probably taken difficult decisions to lay off some of their workers. If they have to reduce the size of production, they have to reduce the size of employment as well.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/japanese-cos-may-invest-at-vggs/articleshow/86101179.cms||Niyati Parikh

The trained ones will then represent India at the Shanghai event in 2022. On Friday, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia interacted with all the district-level winners and assured them of all help for further competitions. He said, “The Kejriwal government will provide world-class training to all the participants representing the country in the Shanghai competition. These participants will win in Shanghai and bring laurels to the country and Delhi. For the first time, skill competition was held in Delhi. More than 1,000 participants took part in them.” The minister added that they wanted to organise the competition in 2015 itself, but then there was no such system in Delhi. “There was no infrastructure. In the last five years, we created that system so that the youth of Delhi can get that opportunity,” he said.

---||Goa||Need minimum 10 games to prepare India for Asian Cup 2022: Dennerby||Panaji: Thomas Dennerby wasn’t surprised when the All India Football Federation (AIFF) asked him to take charge of the senior team for the AFC Women’s Asian Cup 2022. Dennerby was coach of the under-17 team for the Fifa World Cup 2022 but the unexpected resignation of long-time coach Maymol Rocky left a void with the seniors. With little time on hand, AIFF turned to one of its own. “When you have an experienced coach already on the ground, (AIFF thought) why not use him. Because of my CV and what I have done in the past, to me it became a natural thing to move to the senior team,” Dennerby said during an online media interaction on Saturday. The 62-year-old Swedish coach’s expertise with women’s football is unquestionable. He coached Sweden to a third-place finish at the World Cup in 2011 and a quarter-final spot in the 2012 London Olympics. He also coached Nigeria at the 2019 Women’s World Cup. It won’t be easy though at the Asian Cup to be played in India from January 20 next year. He started training the team three weeks ago in Jharkhand and there are just four more months left. Dennerby’s goal is to make it to the quarterfinals, introduced for the first time as the tournament gets expanded from eight teams to 12. “We have a good squad,” said Dennerby. “Our goal will be to make it to the knockout stage, which is the quarterfinals. We also know we will play good opponents. After five months of preparations and some good games, we should definitely try to reach the knockout stage. If that happens, it will be a super good tournament for us.” For the hosts to make any headway at the 2022 edition, the team needs competitive games, never easy during times of Covid-19 and bio-secure bubbles. For now, without the Indian Women’s League (IWL) for the second year and the senior nationals, all that the team is doing is compete amongst themselves every Saturday. For the first time this week, they will play Jharkhand XI. “It’s important to play games. Before the tournament starts, we need to play 12 games. AIFF is working hard, trying to help us, but we also know about the Covid-19 situation. It’s tough for us to find opponents (to come here) and tough for other countries to allow us to come. In some countries, India continues to be red-marked. “Even if we prepare well with good endurance training and a lot of hard work, you need to put all this training into games. We need nothing less than 10 games with different kinds of opponents,” said Dennerby.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/need-minimum-10-games-to-prepare-india-for-asian-cup-2022-dennerby/articleshow/86126690.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

Out of the 49 Covid patients, just one is on ventilator, 18 are without oxygen support and 30 with oxygen support. All these hospitalised patients are admitted to three Covid centres — DOT Hostel Shivaji University, Isolation Hospital and Sane Guruji Covid Hospital Rajopadhyenagar. The rest of the 15 Covid centres run by the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) have been temporarily shut due to the dip in the Covid cases. Currently, 446 oxygen beds, 1,185 non-oxygen beds and eight ventilator beds are vacant in Kolhapur city alone. So far, 10,851 Covid patients have been treated in the KMC run centres. Prakash Pawra, acting chief medical officer of KMC said, “The trend in decline of the Covid cases is witnessed since last month. The centres are temporarily shut and not permanantly closed. We are going to add more beds and facilities at these centres in anticipation of a possible third wave of the pandemic.” In Kolhapur city, just 22 patients are home isolated. In the district 1,172 patients are undergoing treatment in both home isolation and hospitals. The number of tests has come down at the public facilities, while over 2,000 tests reports are generated from the private labs. Most of the reports are of pending swabs and therefore the district continues to report some cases every day. Kolhapur had reported a spike in Covid cases later than the rest of the state during the second wave of the pandemic. The authorities were particularly worried as the district had the highest vaccine coverage in the state. Moreover, health authorities had found that as many as 2% to 4% of the fully-vaccinated people in Kolhapur were among those detected with Covid.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/covid-cases-in-hosps-lowest-in-kolhapur-city-since-2nd-wave/articleshow/86099639.cms||---

---||Meerut||Uttar Pradesh: Postman flees with savings of hundreds in 9 villages||MEERUT: For close to three decades, Harish Singh, a BAMS doctor, travelled to a distant town to treat patients. He charged just Rs 20 each. Bit by bit, his savings grew. So did his daughter, for whose wedding he was toiling. His life savings, Rs 13 lakh, were deposited in an account at his village post office. Or so he thought. Sindo Devi, now 69, had recently received Rs 76,000 for construction of a house under Pradhan Mantri Aawas scheme. The money was deposited in an account in the same post office branch in Muzaffarabad village of Saharanpur. Like Singh and Devi, hundreds of others living in Muzaffarabad and surrounding eight villages had their savings deposited in the post office. It's no more there. Their savings -- which may run into several lakhs now -- were allegedly pocketed by a postman, who never deposited most of the money into the government exchequer. And before fleeing, Rakesh Kumar collected passbooks from most of his victims and set them on fire. “I had 2 lakh rupees in that account. I had earned it by working as a labourer at construction sites and in the fields. The postman took away my passbook last month and said that he needed it to upload some data to the computer. Since then, he never returned,” Devi said, wailing. Singh too is in a desperate situation. “Whatever I had earned was for my daughter’s wedding. What will happen now,” asked Kaushalya Singh, his wife. The couple is running from pillar to post to prove that they have a post office account, and that their hard-earned money was deposited there. Nem Chandra, former pradhan of Khurrampur, the village that has around 500 houses and a population of around 2,000 people, told TOI that all of them had at least one account in the post office run by Rakesh. “He looted the entire village and fled. Hundreds have been duped in nine villages,” Chandra claimed. Basant, a school teacher and another victim, said the postman collected the passbooks of the entire Muzaffarabad village and set them on fire, days before fleeing. “Someone had seen him doing that. When questioned, he refused to answer. Later we found a lock outside his house,” he added. Station house officer (SHO) of Behat area, KP Singh, said, “The postman, Rakesh, was running a sub-centre of the post office in Muzaffarabad village which had over 2,000 accounts of people from nine nearby villages. He fled with all the money. Now we are searching for him. His son has been apprehended and is being interrogated.” The SHO said that postman Kumar had never opened any account of these villagers. When police tried to verify the account numbers given by the villagers from the main post office in Saharanpur, the officials there said that most of these accounts were either fake or owned by someone else. “Almost all the accounts were fake. He duped hundreds of people, even those who were working with him from the last many decades,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/postman-flees-with-savings-of-hundreds-in-9-villages-of-ups-saharanpur/articleshow/86100496.cms||Ishita Mishra

Despite lower acreage, the output is expected to increase in 2021-22 due to the improved yield following recent spell of rain and favourable climatic condition, said market players. “So far, weather conditions have remained favourable for cotton crop. Although the area under cotton cultivation is lower than last year, the state’s own production is likely to increase by up to 10% as cotton yield is expected to improve this year,” said Arun Dalal, a cotton broker from Ahmedabad.  A recent pan-India survey conducted by a Mumbai-based company dealing in cotton pegged Gujarat’s production at 105 lakh bales (one bale equals 170 kg) in 2021-22. The state’s total cotton crop output had stood at 93.50 lakh bales, according to the Cotton Association of India (CAI) in 2020-21. The state agriculture department’s latest data shows that about 22.51 lakh hectares of land have been brought under cotton cultivation this kharif season. As against this, the acreage was a tad higher at 23 lakh hectare last year. “With the revival of monsoon, several cotton growing areas in the state have received good rains over the past few days, which is very beneficial to the standing crop. At present, there are no reports of pest infestation as well,” said Arvind Pan, president, Saurashtra Cotton Ginners Association (SCGA). “With yield expected to improve, Gujarat’s total production is likely to be 105 lakh bales in2021-22,” Pan added. The crop scenario is also encouraging in Maharashtra, Telangana, and Andhra Pradesh. As these states have limited ginning capacity, their cotton comes for ginning in Gujarat and the same is covered under the overall crop output of the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cotton-production-likely-to-rise-by-12-in-new-season/articleshow/86101206.cms||Kalpesh Damor

The body of Atmaram Tomar (75), bearing marks of struggle, was found Thursday night by his driver, a few hours after his murder, police said. Atmaram lived alone in the house. His elder son works and lives in Meerut while the younger one is in the US with his mother. A BJP veteran, he was given ministerial-rank post in 1997 when Kalyan Singh was in power in the state. According to sources in the police and family, Atmaram was choked to death. Police got the clue about the alleged killers while scanning CCTV footage. It showed two men arriving at the gate on a motorcycle on Thursday evening. About 45 minutes later, one of them hopped into the SUV of the BJP leader and drove away, while his accomplice fled on the bike. Atmaram’s mobile phone was also missing. Superintendent of police (SP) of Baghpat, Neeraj Kumar Jadaun, said, “Police received a call from the deceased's elder son Pratap Tomar, who lives in Meerut. The room in which the deceased's body was lying was locked from outside. The family suspects role of a relative and his accomplice in the murder. The BJP leader and the two men were involved in some dispute over money. “An FIR has been registered against the accused, Praveen Kumar and Balram Singh,” the SP said, adding that they have been booked under IPC sections 302 (murder) and 380 (theft). In his complaint to the police, Atmaram’s elder son, Pratap, a radiologist, said, “Praveen -- the main accused-- used to work at a gas agency owned by my father. He was removed due to financial irregularities recently. However, my father called him back at the family's request. But he was still angry. Praveen and his accomplice Balram killed my father.” On August 11 last year, former district president of BJP, Sanjay Khokhar, was killed while he was out for morning walk in Chaprauli region of Baghpat. The murder had led to a massive crackdown on criminals. According to BJP's district president Suraj Pal Singh, “This was an unfortunate incident. I have spoken with all senior police officers regarding the murder and have asked them to arrest the culprits as soon as possible.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/up-bjp-leader-murdered-at-his-home-in-baghpat-relative-booked/articleshow/86100508.cms||Sandeep Rai
---||Goa||Tough for injured Bala Devi to make it to Asian Cup 2022, says coach||Panaji: India’s top striker Bala Devi is unlikely to regain full fitness and make it to the squad for the AFC Women’s Asian Cup 2022 at home, coach Thomas Dennerby said on Saturday. The country’s biggest name in women’s football became the first Indian woman to earn a professional football contract abroad when she joined Rangers FC in February last year. She extended her contract with the club and returned home in July to recover from an injury. “From what I have heard, Bala has an ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) injury and she is not with us because of that,” Dennerby told reporters during an online media interaction. “She will do her surgery very soon I guess, if she hasn’t already done. But this is September and ACL injury normally takes a couple of months. For her, it’s really a tough situation to be ready for Asian Cup.” Sources said the 31-year old striker had surgery for ACL earlier this month. If the experienced Bala misses out, it will be a big blow to the team’s chances in the tournament being played at home. The former India captain has 42 goals in 47 international games. The 2022 edition of the Women’s Asian Cup will be played with 12 teams for the first time, four more than the last four editions. The DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai, Mumbai Football Arena in Andheri and Shiv Chhatrapati Sports Complex in Balewadi, Pune, will host all games from January 20 to February 6, 2022.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/tough-for-injured-bala-devi-to-make-it-to-asian-cup-2022-says-coach/articleshow/86126849.cms||Marcus Mergulhao
---||Kolhapur||Conman held for cheating Baramati resident on pretext of curing cancer||PUNE/KOLHAPUR: The Pune rural police on Friday arrested Manohar Bhosale (39), who claims to have spiritual and healing powers, from Satara in connection with a case registered against him with the Baramati taluka police station. He is also named a suspect in a case registered in Solapur. He has been booked for cheating and extorting Rs 2.5 lakh under the pretext of curing cancer of a Baramati resident. The man’s 23-year-old son filed a complaint against Bhosale and two of his accomplices on Thursday. Bhosale claims to be an incarnation of a saintly figure revered by the Dhangar community. He has an ashram at Undargaon village in Karmala taluka of Solapur district. The trio has been booked under sections 420 (cheating), 384 (extortion) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the relevant sections of the The Maharashtra Prevention and Eradication of Human Sacrifice and other Inhuman, Evil and Aghori Practices and Black Magic Act and the Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act. Senior inspector Mahesh Dhavan of the Baramati taluka police told TOI that the complainant's father is suffering from cancer. “About two years ago, he had approached Bhosale, who had promised to cure the disease,” Dhavan said. He said that Bhosale and his accomplices gave the man leaves of babool tree, sugar and turmeric as medicine. “They had taken Rs 2.5 lakh for the treatment. When the patient did not have any positive effects, his son demanded his money back. At that time, the suspects also had threatened him,” Dhavan said. The inspector said that Bhosale has been taken into custody from Lonand in Satara district. “Our probe is on,” Dhavan said. Bhosale has also been named a suspect in a case registered with Solapur rural police under sections 376 (sexual abuse), 385 (extortion) , 506 (criminal intimidation) of IPC, and section 3 of Black Magic Act based on a complaint from a woman. The woman approached Solapur superintendent of police Tejaswi Satpute on Thursday and filed a complaint claiming that since 2019, she had been sexually abused multiple times against her will by Bhosale. The complaint states that Bhosale had also taken Rs 1.90 lakh from her, assuring her to rid of all her domestic issues and making her financially sound. “I was threatened by him and his assistants not to register the complaint stating that he has supernatural powers,” states the complaint. The Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmulan Samiti had recently set up a fact-finding committee after they received numerous complaints against Bhosale. Hamid Dabholkar of MANS said, “Since 2015, we are receiving complaints against him.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/conman-held-for-cheating-baramati-resident-on-pretext-of-curing-cancer/articleshow/86099733.cms||Mihir Tanksale
---||World||India, US to talk climate finance as Biden’s special envoy visits on Monday||NEW DELHI: Seeking to speed up clean energy deployment to decarbonise their economies in a big way through bilateral cooperation in the next 10 years, India and the US will launch ‘Climate Action and Finance Mobilisation Dialogue’ during the visit of the American special presidential envoy for climate John Kerry here on Monday. The dialogue is one of the two main tracks of the ‘India-US Climate and Clean Energy Agenda 2030 Partnership’ which was jointly laid out by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and American President Joe Biden at the leaders summit on climate in April. Its other track, the Strategic Clean Energy Partnership (SCEP), was launched by minister of petroleum & natural gas Hardeep Singh Puri and the US energy secretary Jennifer Granholm in virtual mode on Thursday. “Both these tracks will together work for mobilising finance and scaling up deployment of clean technologies. It will help India reach its ambitious goal of installing 450 GW of renewable energy by 2030 under the country’s ongoing energy transition efforts,” said an official. He said the US presidential envoy for climate would meet both environment minister Bhupender Yadav and power & renewable energy minister R K Singh on Monday, besides launching the ‘Climate Action and Finance Mobilization Dialogue’. The meeting assumes significance as it may pave the way for more intense dialogue over the ‘net-zero’ emission goal agenda of different countries ahead of the upcoming 26th session of the UN climate conference (COP26), scheduled to be held in Glasgow, UK in November. It is expected that Kerry during his September 12-14 visit would pitch for bringing India on board for ‘net-zero’ goal mission by mid-century. Though India is not averse to the idea of ‘carbon neutrality’ future for the globe, the country has consistently been insisting for different timelines for different countries to achieve such goals keeping in view their respective capabilities and national circumstances under the key principles of the Paris Agreement. It is expected that the country will next month take a call on updating its climate action goals - called nationally determined contribution (NDC) – under the Paris Agreement by factoring in overachievement of its current pledges. India has already reduced its carbon emission intensity (emission per unit of GDP) by 28% over 2005 levels, against its target of 33-35% by 2030. Similarly, its capacity of non-fossil fuel-based power generation has already reached nearly 39% of its total installed power generation capacity against the target of 40% by 2030. India is with this pace expected to reach the target of 40% by 2023. This makes India among one of the few countries globally which has been on track to meet its 2015 Paris Agreement commitments. “The Special Envoy’s travel will bolster the United States’ bilateral and multilateral climate efforts ahead of the 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which will be held October 31 to November 12, 2021, in Glasgow, United Kingdom,” said the US state department in a statement on Kerry’s India visit. It said the Special Presidential Envoy for Climate would travel to India from September 12-14 “to engage with international counterparts on efforts to address the climate crisis”. “Special Presidential Envoy Kerry will meet with Government of India counterparts and private sector leaders to discuss efforts to raise global climate ambition and speed India’s clean energy transition,” said the statement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/india-us-to-talk-climate-finance-as-bidens-special-envoy-visits-on-monday/articleshow/86104877.cms||Vishwa Mohan

---||Kozhikode||Two-member panel to examine syllabus||Kozhikode: Kannur University constituted a two-member expert committee to examine the revised syllabus of MA Governance and Politics course after the inclusion of writings by Hindutva ideologues, including MS Golwalkar and VS Savarkar, in the syllabus sparked off a row. Vice-chancellor Gopinath Ravindran said the committee, comprising Prof J Prabhash (former HoD of politics at Kerala University) and Prof KS Pavithran (former HoD of politics at Calicut University), will submit a report within five days. He said that if they recommend changes, the varsity will make it. He said that the stand that students should not read Savarkar is not an academic argument. “JNU and Delhi University had included these texts as part of the syllabus. If we don’t read the texts of Savarkar and Golwalkar, it will be difficult for us to understand the politics playing out before us in current times. A student has to read the texts and the syllabus aims to help them develop a critical understanding of the topic, though it has shortcomings,” he added. The VC said that he had submitted a report to the higher education minister saying that the writings of Hindutva icons were included to enable students develop a critical understanding about various strands of Indian Political Thought, topic of the core course in third semester of the course. “In the same unit, students will be reading texts of Rabindranath Tagore, Mahatma Gandhi, Aurobindo, Ambedkar, Nehru along with the foundational texts of Hindutva. The texts of Hindutva proponents were taken from a reader edited by French political scientist Christophe Jaffrelot,” he said. VC said the varsity had given secondary texts in syllabus to help students develop an understanding of the topic. These include the likes of Sheldon Pollock, a Sanskrit researcher from Columbia University, and AK Ramanujan the inclusion of whose books in syllabus of various universities, including JNU, was vehemently opposed by BJP supporters. “We cannot say that the inclusion of the texts was part of an attempt at saffronisation of education,” he added. Ravindran added that there was some shortcoming in the syllabus as it has not given adequate representation to Left political thought and instead of five texts by Hindutva ideologues, two would have been more appropriate. Meanwhile, the varsity found itself at the receiving end of criticism over the issue not only from the opposition but also from senior LDF leaders. The issue also laid bare the conflicting opinion in SFI with Kannur University students’ union chairman MK Hassan supporting the decision while SFI state secretary KM Sachin Dev saying that inclusion of writings by Hindutva icons was totally unacceptable. Hassan said the stand of students’ union is that we should deal with ideologies critically after studying them. Former SFI national president V Sivadasan also supported the inclusion of the texts saying that it will provide an opportunity to students to understand how the philosophical underpinnings of Hitler is being used in India as part of Hindutva politics. Meanwhile, the varsity witnessed a wave of protests for the second day with AISF taking out a protest march demanding the withdrawal of the writings. KSU activists blocked the VC’s vehicle. CPI leader Benoy Viswam said it was a move at saffronisation of education on the pattern implemented at JNU in which syllabus was changed without the knowledge of academic bodies like board of studies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/two-member-panel-to-examine-syllabus/articleshow/86101293.cms||---

Since Covid-19 unfolded, the train has remained cancelled. However, regular passengers decided to ensure that their tradition of ‘Bappa on Wheels’ continued. The idol of Lord Ganesh was therefore installed in a coach provided by the railways at Manmad yard. The Godavari Express Ganesh Mandal has been celebrating Ganeshotsav in this manner for the last 25 years. Vivek Shejwal, president of the mandal, said that a number of members, who travelled daily by the train to Nashik or Mumbai for work, are now in deep financial crisis, yet every member has contributed to ensure that the tradition of ‘Bappa on Wheels’ continues. “Like last year, this year too we have installed the idol in a coach in Manmad yard, which was given to us by the railway administration. We decorated the coach and carried out the rituals this morning,” said Shejwal. He added that the mandal had organised various programmes to benefit members . “Although many of us have lost jobs, members remain in touch with each other providing moral support in these trying times. It is the blessings of Lord Ganesh that many of us are getting some renewed source of earnings,” said Narendra Khaire, a member of the mandal. “We are hopeful that the rate of infection of Covid would soon drop and things would be back to normal. Through Ganeshotsav, we pray that the train starts at the earliest not only providing us the chance to earn our living but also helping innumerous others whose lives depend on the train,” said Sachin Naik, another member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/daily-passengers-worship-lord-ganapati-in-train-coach/articleshow/86099771.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

According to officials of the Public Health Engineering Department (PHED), water supply will be cut by 15% in Jaipur and Tonk, and 10% in Ajmer if rains do not occur in five days. PHED ACS Sudhansh Pant took the decision after holding a review meeting with officials of the department on Friday. The state has received low rainfall and the Bisalpur dam is only 32.30% full. This can create a huge crisis. Additional chief engineer Manish Beniwal said that the department was looking into alternatives. “We have already cut 5% of the water supply in Jaipur and Tonk. If by September 15, rainfall doesn’t occur, then we will further cut 10% water supply in both the cities and 10% in Ajmer. We are fully prepared for any crisis and will take appropriate action.” 267 dams in state emptyMany parts of the state are in a drought-like situation. Currently, out of 727 dams in Rajasthan, 267 are empty, 313 are partially full and 125 full. All the dams together have a capacity to store 12,626 million cubic metres of water in the state. But the total water level was 59.96% as on September 10, which is lower than the level on September 3, 2020 i.e. 71.10%. The PHED recently announced water trains for Pali district by September-end as the water level in Jawai dam was just at 10 feet due to low rainfall.

If some additions proposed are to be dropped, the university would do so. So is the case of any addition in the syllabus,” the minister said on Friday evening. The minister’s reaction came after she received a report from Kannur University vice-chancellor Gopinath Ravindran regarding the issue. The minister had earlier termed the developments in connection with the university syllabus as ‘highly sensitive’. CPM state acting secretary A Vijayaraghavan too said that the matter demands serious attention. “Ours is a secular country. It’s dangerous to have communal references in university syllabus,” the minister said, adding that university authorities need not be strictly aware of all changes in the syllabus and its nuances. The new course for MA Governance and Political Science was introduced in Brennan College under Kannur University last year. The study recommended for the third semester of the course —themes in Indian political thought— has kindled a controversy as critics dubbed the inclusion of the political thoughts of Golwalker and Savarkar as saffronization of the syllabus.tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/kannur-varsity-will-review-controversial-syllabus-min/articleshow/86101304.cms||---

---||Nashik||24% of road accident victims pedestrians||Nashik: Pedestrians account for nearly one-fourth of the casualties reported in road accidents in the city in the first eight monthsof this year. Over 24% of the total 113 deaths in road accidents reported in Nashik city between January and August this year involved pedestrians, shows the data provided by the city traffic police. The police said there were 312 accidents during this period in the city, a majority of which involved two-wheelers, cars and autos. Most of these accidents took place due to rash driving. As many as 27 pedestrians were killed and 58 others injured in these accidents. Police authorities said that before the Covid pandemic, on an average, 50 to 60 pedestrians would get killed in a year. According to the data, the highest number of pedestrians (6) was killed in March this year, followed by five in January. August registered just one death, lowest during these eight months. Traffic police officer said that a major reason for pedestrians getting killed in road mishaps was that the many footpaths are encroached upon. “Hence, they are compelled to walk on the roads and get knocked down by motorists indulging in rash driving,” said a traffic police officer. Officials said there were also a few fatalities at spots where the pavements are devoid of any kind of obstructions but the victims were walking on the road. “A few pedestrians have died while they were crossing the road without being alert of approaching vehicles,” added the police officier. “We have been writing to the Nashik Municipal Corporation at regular intervals highlighting the need to make the footpaths encroachment-free. The civic body does take drives from time to time,” said the police officer Assistant police commissioner (traffic) Sitaram Gaikwad has appealed to pedestrians to walk cautiously on road. “We have decided to identify the zones in the city that are accident-prone, especially for the pedestrians. Once we ascertain those, we will take remedial measures to prevent the accidents,” added Gaikwad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/24-of-road-accident-victims-pedestrians/articleshow/86099773.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Lucknow||‘Zara yaad karo qurbani’: 1965 war hero Abdul Hamid goes unsung on death anniversary||LUCKNOW: Thousands pass through this roundabout in Cantonment area every day but very few know that the gun-mounted jeep at one corner, named after legendary war hero and Param Vir Chakra (PVC) awardee, Abdul Hamid, is the original military vehicle that was used by the infantry troops to destroy heavily-armoured Patton Tanks in the 1965 Indo-Pak War. A similar jeep was used by Abdul Hamid to destroy four Patton tanks before he attained martyrdom, which earned Hamid the sobriquet of “the slayer of Patton Tanks” and ‘Vir Abdul Hamid’. As the country celebrates 75th year of Independence, very few remember the hero who defended India’s sovereignty. TOI spoke to some passersby at the roundabout and found that none had any knowledge about the man and the jeep that are on display at the spot since 1993. No one even paid any homage to Hamid on his death anniversary on Friday (September 10). Born on July 1, 1933 in Dhamupur, Ghazipur, Hamid was company quartermaster who was given charge of anti-tank recoilless gun detachment to hold Pakistani armoured regiment crossing Asal Uttar village on September 8, 1965. By September 10, Hamid had taken out four Patton tanks of the Pakistan Army. He was mortally wounded by a high explosive shell and passed away on September 10, 1965. On December 3, 1993, the then GOC-in-chief, central command, Lt Gen YN Sharma, dedicated a jeep-mounted recoilless rifle to Lucknow Cantonment in the memory of Abdul Hamid. “Abdul Hamid belongs to UP. Army has installed a statue on the roundabout to commemorate the sacrifice. A programme or at least decoration of the roundabout with flowers could have been done to let general public know the importance of September 10,” said veteran Col Prabhat Ranjan (Sena Medal), the artillery officer who participated in Operation Meghdoot and Operation Vijay. There are 35 gallantry award recipients, both officers and jawans, who hail from Lucknow or are settled here but only a few have statues or roads in their name. Uday Khatri (73), son of freedom-fighter Ram Krishan Khatri, who was convicted in Kakori action and sentenced to 10 years’ jail, said the war heroes should be given the same respect as freedom fighters. Col (retd) TBS Pangtey said, “The city has three PVC roundabouts (after Manoj Pandey, Abdul Hamid and Jadunath Singh). It’s imperative for military establishment that at least their sacrifice is remembered on their death anniversaries.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/1965-war-hero-abdul-hamid-goes-unsung-on-death-anniv/articleshow/86101861.cms||Arvind Chauhan
---||Nashik||Vighnaharta arrives home sans dhol-tasha fanfare, residents pray for a healthier future||Nashik: The 10-day Ganapati festival kicked off in Nashik with traditional fervour and gaiety. Despite various restrictions imposed by the state government to prevent overcrowding apparently, the spirit of Nashikites wouldn’t be dampened and they celebrated the festival with zeal. Like last year, the sound of the dhol-tasha that reverberates throughout the city on Ganesh Chaturthi and the large processions were missing this year too due to the pandemic restrictions. District guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal reminded Nashikites to strictly adhere to Covid-appropriate behaviour while celebrating the festival. “I have prayed to Lord Ganapati to prevent any further wave of the pandemic in Maharashtra. These are trying times for all of us and we should pray for the wellbeing of each of us. We need the cooperation of the people to tame the virus,” remarked Bhujbal. Some residential societies in the city organised the festival since the number the of cases has ebbed in the city for now. Ganapati Mandals in the city said the celebrations will remain low-key due to restrictions set by the state government. None of the mandals organised the traditional procession. “We brought our idol in a palkhi with a small group of members accompanying it. We will also not allow any kind of gatherings in front of the pandal. We have made arrangements for online darshan,” said Shlok Bhagwat, vice president of Ravivar Karanja Mandal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/vighnaharta-arrives-home-sans-dhol-tasha-fanfare-residents-pray-for-a-healthier-future/articleshow/86099803.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nagpur||‘Only tech-enabled biz providing extreme personalized services will survive’||Covid-19 pandemic and the ensuing lockdown acted as a catalyst for people to accept technology in almost every aspect of their life. Well known tech-entrepreneur and serial investor Shashikant Chaudhary told TOI in an interview that this has completely changed the consumer’s expectations, and leveraging technology will be the only way every business can survive. Excerpts... Q. Many wonder if every single business, regardless of its size, will have to leverage technology in the future... A. Every single business on this planet will now be disrupted due to use and access of technology by consumers. Regardless of the business you are in, it has to be either technology driven or enabled to ensure an edge over competitors. From now on, every business will survive on three vectors — personalization, real-time information and convenience of consumption. Consumers now want extreme level of personalization when accessing any product or service. Also, they want information and service interaction has to be in real-time. Lastly, they are looking for convenience in availing of these services. Q. Can you put this into perspective of, let’s say, a neighbourhood kirana store? A. Let’s start with ‘convenience’. If the shop owner develops an app through which customers can order or even start a basic order-on-Whatsapp service, then it offers a big convenience factor as customer does not need to visit the shop. Personalization is offering and delivering products/services as per the customer’s demand. Every customer has preferences when it comes to products. So, they will either prefer a specific brand of rice or quantity size that’s perfect for their monthly requirements and may even want the groceries package to be delivered at a specific time/day. By ensuring all of this, the kirana store owner will enhance the personalization experience for their consumers. Next is real-time information which the consumer needs. So, if s/he’s ordering a product, real-time information has to be available on whether the product is in stock and by when it will be delivered. In high-rise communities, neighbourhood shops are using technology to access more customers and schedule deliveries in a way where logistics are better handled. Q. So while business gurus for decades have said that ‘customer is king’, you say we are now going a step further in ‘extreme personalization’? A. All things being equal, the new battlefield for businesses from now on will be customer experience. Now, you need to serve customers in their preferred location through their preferred channel and with their preferred products. If you don’t do that, then someone else definitely will and they shall gain the business edge. New-age taxi cab aggregators like Uber and Ola are perfect example of gaining over ‘kaali-peeli’ taxis because of consumer personalization. The consumer can choose the type of cab s/he’s getting (small, sedan etc), track live location via GPS, choose pick-up location, estimated fare, driver details etc. Q. But even after the pandemic, will people still continue the same level of online engagement, or revert to traditional methods? A. I would say that online engagement of consumers has been going on long before Covid-19 came, and every year it’s increasing. We have been using online platforms for shopping, cab booking, travel and movie tickets, hotel reservations, food delivery etc extensively. During the pandemic, some other aspects like online classes, medical counselling etc have increased drastically which give the impression that online engagement started only in the last one year. In fact, the fast decreasing cost and increasing capability of technology has been changing the scenario fast for us. The world’s top computer technology of 1997 is now available in our mobile phone. In India, we can get 1GB data for Rs18, which is the cheapest in the world. This has has led to an average monthly consumption of 15GB. This means everybody now has access to technology and that’s why all businesses will be affected. Just last week, I saw that even a ‘bhutta’ seller outside VNIT gate is now accepting digital payments. This shows how every business is now integrating technology in some way or the other to provide a better experience to consumers. Q. Do you foresee everything, right from teaching to medical, shifting online? A. In the immediate future, things will continue to be of hybrid model for intangible products/services like teaching or medical advice. But the percentage of technology being used shall continue to increase. In the medical field, robotic surgery or real-time online diagnosis of blood pressure through sensors in watches are changing the playing field. So, you can take medical advice from a doctor based in the US but for actual surgery, the patient will still require physical interaction in the immediate future. But ultimately, everything will pivot towards providing the customer a more personalized and convenient service. A patient can’t be sent on a form-filling spree from counter to counter before being assessed. All organizations will have to include technology in their daily operations which ultimately makes the consumer experience enriching.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/only-tech-enabled-biz-providing-extreme-personalized-services-will-survive/articleshow/86125248.cms||Abhishek Choudhari

---||Thiruvananthapuram||Can’t glorify naysayers of freedom struggle: CM||Thiruvananthapuram: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan clarified that it is not the government’s approach to glorify ideologies and leaders who had turned their faces away from the country’s independence struggle. Reacting to Kannur University’s decision to include the articles by RSS ideologues V D Savarkar and M S Golwalkar in the post-graduate course syllabi of the university, the chief minister said that sometimes it may be required to critically examine such ideologies, but no one should glorify those. Stating that the higher education minister and the university vice-chancellor has already responded in the matter, he said that the university has also initiated steps in this regard and appointed a two-member committee. The expert committee includes former pro vice-chancellor and former professor of political sciences of Kerala University J Prabhash and former political sciences professor in Calicut University K S Pavithran. The chief minister said that the university vice-chancellor himself has clarified that a decision will be taken on the basis of the recommendations of the expert committee. The university had included the extracts from Savarkar’s “Hindutva: who is a Hindu”, and Golwalkar’s “Bunch of Thoughts” in the MA governance and politics syllabi of the university. Meanwhile, opposition leader V D Satheesan said that Kannur University should reconsider its decision and immediately withdraw the syllabus. He said that the decision of the university to give recognition to the spiritual and political leaders of the murderers of Gandhiji cannot be agreed to. The move to implement the RSS agenda in the state’s civil society through the university is condemnable. Satheesan said that this is a hardcore rightwing stand, and it should be clarified if the universities in the state and CPM are supporting this stand. He further said that Savarkar and Golwalkar were people who tried to build a religion-based country. He asked whether the students should learn the ideology of such individuals or the teachings of Gandhiji and Jawaharlal Nehru.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/cant-glorify-naysayers-of-freedom-struggle-cm/articleshow/86101329.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: 2 RPS officials, 2 SHOs suspended in lewd video case||JAIPUR: DGP ML Lather on Friday suspended Jhotwara ACP and Kuchaman City DSP along with SHOs of Kalwar in Jaipur and Chittawa in Nagaur for their inept investigation into a viral video showing suspended Beawar DSP Heera Lal Saini indulging in sexual activities with a woman constable in the presence of latter’s minor son in a swimming pool. The Rajasthan police have treated the sexual act as a case of child molestation. Officials said that the woman constable had filed an FIR in July at Kalwar police station about the video being circulated by someone demanding money from her. “SHO Guru Dutt did not dispose of the case in a timely fashion nor did he inform senior officials,” an official said, adding that Jhotwara ACP Hari Shankar was also suspended because he did not oversee the matter. Similarly, Chittawa SHO Prakash Chand was sent to the lines on Thursday and suspended by DGP on Friday because he failed to register an FIR on a complaint filed by the husband of the woman constable against her and Saini for indulging in sexual activities in the presence of his son. Police later learned that Nagaur SP had marked the husband’s complaint and sent it to Chittawa SHO, but the latter did not file an FIR. DSP Kuchaman City Motaram Beniwal was also suspended because he had allegedly negotiated to settle the case. Rajasthan police officials said that all the suspended cops did not do their duty as per the rules of PHQ during multiple range-level meetings. Talking to TOI, DGP ML Lather said that he had held multiple meetings at range level where he had directed DSPs posted as circle officers (COs) to dispose of case files and submit chargesheets on time. “It is the duty of DSP to facilitate investigation into cases through supervisory notes and keep senior officials abreast of the progress,” Lather said. He said that suspended officials did not pay heed to directives issued to them and thus a stern action was warranted. Saini was suspended by the DGP on Wednesday when the lewd video went viral. The vigilance division suspended the woman constable on the same day after her involvement became clear. Action against Udaipur official: A senior RPS official in Udaipur was put on awaiting posting order (APO) on Friday. DGP ML Lather issued orders to send DSP Hitesh Mehta, posted as circle officer (CO) at Mavli to APO. Mehta was first transferred to RAC as assistant commandant but was then quickly put under APO.

Initially, the drive was in the form of ‘No helmet, No petrol’ at fuel stations from August 15. Later, it was extended from September 9 making it mandatory for the motorists and pillion riders to wear the head gears while on roads. “My feedback is that an increasing number of motorists have started wearing helmets,” said Pandey during an interaction with Times Group journalists on Friday. According to him, the significant aspect of the helmet drive is that the violators are not being penalised for not wearing helmets. “If motorists do not wear helmets, the fuel stations do not give them fuel. If caught on road, the erring motorists have to undergo a counselling session on various aspects related to road traffic at the Nashik First Traffic Park,” he said. In the last eight months since January, the city police have caught over 9,000 motorists for driving without helmets. During this period, there were 30 road accidents, involving motorists not wearing helmets. In these accidents, 13 motorists lost their lives and 26 sustained serious injuries. Pandey added that the city police were extremely serious about the initiative and will step it up in days to come.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/helmet-drive-in-nashik-city-is-yielding-results-cp/articleshow/86099811.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Chandigarh||Punjab: Farmer bodies tell political parties to suspend election campaigns||CHANDIGARH: The SKM on Friday appealed to political parties to suspend their poll campaign till the schedule for Punjab assembly elections is announced so that the focus remains on their agitation against the Centre’s farm laws. The Morcha leaders also discussed the demand to make the election manifesto of political parties with their (political parties) representatives even as the need to thwart any attempts to spoil the atmosphere of Punjab in the run up to the elections was underlined. BKU leader Balbir Singh Rajewal, who presided over the meeting, said Congress and SAD leaders said they will consult their party leadership before announcing their decision. “This time the election campaign seems to have started much earlier, in the middle of the farmers’ agitation, which is resulting in diversion of attention. Congress and SAD did not give a clear reply and said they will discuss the issue with their respective party leaderships. All other parties agreed with us,” he said. Parties are free to hold small functions that do not attract big gatherings, he added. Meanwhile, Congress general secretary Pargat Singh said, “We conveyed to them that the Congress is committed to ensuring that there is no loss to Punjab’s financial health in any way. The Congress government stands with the farmers. They discussed issues like making the manifesto a legal document and the vision document for the state. We are already ready on these counts.” AAP MLA Kultar Singh Sandhwan said such an atmosphere should not be created in the state that it becomes a ground for President’s rule and thereby hits the farmers’ agitation. “We made it clear that AAP is against the three farm laws and the MSP should be made a legal guarantee... They asked for our advice on suspending political events till elections are announced and we said that we will abide by any decision, but the ruling Congress should not keep going to the voters. The ban should apply to everyone. At the same time, going to community events like marriages in the villages should be exempted.” The dialogue with political parties began at 11am and Rajewal addressed the media at 4pm. Rajewal said all parties agreed to making the election manifesto a legal manifesto and they also suggested that the party that gets to form the government should also announce a calendar to implement the promises. He added that farmers’ opposition to the condition to supply land records for transfer of procurement benefits was also conveyed to the parties, including the ruling Congress. AAP’s Aman Arora alleged that if the atmosphere of Punjab is spoiled, BJP at the Centre would be more than happy. “A consensus should be evolved so that the ruling Congress does not continue its programmes through the state government. The farmers told us that a common decision will be taken for everyone,” he said. “Making the manifesto a legal document was another issue that was discussed, and AAP supports the proposal. Voters should not be misled with false promises,” he added. Congress president Navjot Singh Sidhu left the meeting without speaking to the media. “Had a positive meeting with Samyukt Kisan Morcha … Discussed the way forward !!” he tweeted after the meeting. Lok Insaaf Party MLA Simarjit Singh Bains rued that his party was not initially invited for the event. “There are also indications that initially they wanted to hold a discussion by having all four political parties together but later the schedule was changed to speak to political parties separately. A healthy discussion always goes to strengthen democracy,” he said. Bains said that he suggested that political parties who wish to hold rallies should do it at Singhu and Tikri as such events would then strengthen the farmers’ agitation. Apart from Congress and SAD, representatives of AAP, BSP, Lok Insaaf Party and the SAD (Sanyukt) took part in the meeting. Don’t stall political activities, urges SAD:The SAD on Friday requested the SKM to retain the national character of the ‘kisan andolan’ by not imposing any curbs on political activities in Punjab. It also offered all help to buttress the ongoing agitation on the Delhi borders. After meeting SKM leaders, SAD leaders Prem Singh Chandumajra and Maheshinder Singh Grewal said, “A conspiracy is afoot by the Centre to restrict the kisan movement to Punjab and then suppress it by imposing the President’s rule. Our fight is with the BJP at the national level.” They said the political activity has not been restricted due to the kisan andolan in any other state. “Going to people is as much your right as ours and this should not be restricted,” said the Akali leaders. Other two SAD leaders — Balwinder Singh Bhundur and Daljit Singh Cheema — who also attended the meeting also reiterated their support to the farmers’ protest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farmer-bodies-tell-political-parties-to-suspend-election-campaigns/articleshow/86101308.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Lord Ganesh makes a low-key entry into homes||Lucknow: Amid the pandemic, hundreds of citizens in Lucknow on Friday welcomed Lord Ganesh on the occasion of Ganesh Chaturthi. Though the usual pomp and glory was missing this year again, the devotees and puja committees, adapting to ways of current times with all safety precautions and maintaining guidelines of the government, cheerfully welcomed the ‘Vignaharta’ (remover of all obstacles). Ganesh Prakatya Committee of the famous ‘Manautiyon ke Raja’ held the celebrations at Shri Shyam Satsang Bhawan (Mahanagar) instead of its traditional location at Jhulelal Ghat in the presence of only committee members and their family members. This was the second time this decision was taken keeping in mind the health of thousands of devotees who visit the puja pandal. At Mankameshwar Temple and Hanuman Setu temple, priests were seen following Covid-19 protocols, covering their faces with the mask and maintaining social distancing. Devoid of any community celebration or cultural events, the ‘Aminabad ke Raja’ sitting on a swing, blessed his devotees on the first day of the festival. The organisers distributed packed ‘prasad’ and ensured checking of the devotees before they entered for the 'darshan'. At Chowk’s Bada Shivala Mandir, the ‘Chaupatiyon ke Raja’ arrived with his father Lord Shiva. As huge crowds were kept at bay this year, the rituals were done in the presence of priests and few organising committee members. Maintaining the safety protocols devotees were allowed at a time inside the temple to pray to the God. “This year we have tried to spread the message of safety and protection of children. We have prayed that the third wave of the pandemic doesn't hit us the way the second wave did,” said Riddhi Gaur, president, Shri Shubh Sanskar Navratra Mela Samiti.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/lord-ganesh-makes-a-low-key-entry-into-homes/articleshow/86101876.cms||Aditi Singh

In Gaya town, the condition was worse on roads in godown area, where most of the wholesale shops of foodgrains, cosmetics, fruits and vegetables are located. Mukesh Dutt Tiwari of Fatehganj locality in Gaya town said: “Due to the strike, door-to-door garbage collection is suspended. People are forced to throw the garbage on the road. The garbage thrown from the shops and houses, mixed with rainwater, become so muddy that even walking on foot has become very difficult in the godown area. Stray animals like cows and dogs scatter the garbage, which creates problems for pedestrians and the bikers.” Amitabh Gupta of Piparpanti locality said: “Gaya is a pilgrimage city. The fortnight-long Pitripaksha is beginning from September 19. If the situation continues, the devotees coming to Gaya during Pitripaksha will return with a poor image of the town.” The staff are on strike in support of their 12-point demand, which include regularization of services of these who have been working for the last more than 10 years on contract or daily wages, equal pay for equal work to the daily wage staff, financial help of Rs 10 lakh and service on compassionate grounds to the kin of those staff who died. The ward counsellor of ward number 13, Rahul Kumar, said: “People are facing problems due to garbage on the roads. If the strike is not called off till Saturday, alternate arrangements for lifting of garbage will be made.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/sanitation-staff-strike-leaves-heaps-of-garbage-on-roads/articleshow/86100493.cms||---

Both died at the civil hospital in Rajkot. Ironically the incident occurred on the eve of World Suicide Prevention Day on Friday. Since 2003, September 10 is marked as the day dedicated to creating awareness about ways to prevent suicide. According to police, the deceased were identified as 20-year-old Shyam Mevada, a resident of Gokul Nagar on Saint Kabir road and 15-year-old Dishant Zala, a resident of Lokmanya Tilak Township on Morbi road in Rajkot. Investigation officer K K Nirala told TOI, “We are yet not clear where the duo drank the poison. We are yet to record the statement of the parents. Even the family members are not aware of the possible reason behind the suicide. They too are clueless.” “Mevada was found unconscious on a road near Jakat Naka in Morbi. Zala was found in an unconscious state at his residence on Thursday. Both were taken to the Rajkot civil hospital where they died on Thursday late night,” Nirala said. The two deceased were friends for the past few months. Mevada was a casual labourer, while Zala was studying in class 6. Nirala said that Mevada’s father used to beat drums at events, while Zala’s father was a sanitation worker.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/mystery-shrouds-death-of-two-young-friends-in-rajkot/articleshow/86101360.cms||---

According to the university’s NIRF committee formed for presenting academic report to the body, it was not just one but improvement in all five parameters set by the NIRF that made the university improve its ranking. Last year, BBAU figured in the rank band of 100-151 and this year it jumped to 65th rank in the top100 university category. Prof Arvind Kumar Jha, chairman of BBAU NIRF committee, said, “We worked hard to improve our academic standards, be it research strength or attaining good placement records.” He said leadership, teamwork and collective efforts made under the guidance of vice-chancellor Prof Sanjay Singh raised the university’s academic bar.

---||Lucknow||Cancer institute gets second advanced linear accelerator||Lucknow: Resident of a village in Mohanlalganj, 50-year-old Teji (name changed) was operated for oral cancer by a private cancer institute in the city, only to have a relapse of the malignant growth. On Friday, Teji became the first patient to receive radiotherapy from the advanced linear accelerator, a one-of-a-kind equipment available only at Kalyan Singh Superspecialty Cancer Institute (KSSCI) in UP in the government sector. The first linear accelerator machine was started in April 2020 and caters to around 60 patients daily. The second machine inaugurated on Friday will work with the same target. The institute, which was conceptualised in 2012 but could only see the light of the day in 2020 at the height of Covid pandemic, has managed to get 200 patient registrations a month, including at least 25 new patients coming in to the superspecialty in a day. “We have three OTs with an average of three to four surgeries being conducted daily,” institute director Dr Shaleen Kumar said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/cancer-institute-gets-second-advanced-linear-accelerator/articleshow/86101912.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Farm front says Haryana govt has double standards in action against officials||Chandigarh/Bathinda/Ambala: The Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) on Friday once again accused the Haryana government of adopting double standards on the issue of action against errant officials. SKM leaders alleged that while on one hand chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and his cabinet colleagues order suspension of officials on-the-spot, relieve them of charge or get cases registered against them following simple complaints during public meetings, on the other hand, farmers have been sitting outside the Karnal secretariat for four days for action against errant officials and no action has been taken. “Take the case of suspensions by home minister Anil Vij, chief minister Khattar, deputy CM Dushant Chautala and other ministers and officers. Whereas videos on various issues of farmers have gone viral (but not action has been taken). CM, DyCM have acknowledged the misconduct (of officials in lathicharge on farmers in Karnal), but, their stand is totally different in this case,” said Yogendra Yadav, SKM member. As farmers’ sit-in against the Karnal lathicharge and demand for suspension of then SDM Ayush Sinha entered day four on Friday, SKM leaders claimed it was getting strong support from many quarters. A large cavalcade of farmers associated with BKU (Charuni) Punjab unit attended the ongoing protest outside the Karnal mini secretariat. The farmers, mostly from Patiala and Fatehgarh Sahib districts, were carrying along banners of ‘Mission Punjab 2020 - Haryana Kisan Bachao Rally’. Karnal lawyers have joined the protest at Karnal mini secretariat as farmers from Punjab and Uttar Pradesh have been joining the agitation, they said and added that a panchayat will be organised on Saturday. A cycle march of 50 farmers of Prahar Kisan Sangathan started from Maharashtra on Thursday. The 11-day cycle march will pass through Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh before reaching Ghazipur border on September 19 and Singhu border on 20. On their way to Karnal, Punjab farmers took a break at the Shambhu border of Punjab and Haryana. Their leaders were welcomed and honoured with siropas (robes of honour) at Devi Nagar toll plaza in Ambala and at ‘Kisan Kranti Chowk’ (Pipli Chowk) in Kurukshetra by Haryana members of BKU (Charuni). A member of Charuni’s Mission Punjab 11-member committee, Sarabjit Singh of Fatehgarh Sahib, said if Haryana government did not accept the demands of farmers, those from Punjab would reach Karnal daily. Harinder Singh, a farmer who was part of the cavalcade from Mandour village in Fatehgarh Sahib, said, “We are also carrying forward the call of Mission Punjab as we think farmers will have to join politics to change the system We are planning to field educated persons from among farmers in politics, so they too represent their section in Parliament and assemblies and be participants in the law formation process.” Box 1 year of Pipli lathicharge BKU (Charuni) Haryana also marked one year of a lathicharge by Haryana Police at Pipli Chowk on September 10 last year. On September 9, 2020, BKU (Charuni) national president Gurnam Singh Charuni had given a call to hold a farmers’ ‘Kisan Bachao, Mandi Bachao’ (save farmer, save grain market), at the Pipli grain market in protest against the three farm ordinances, which later became laws. Kurukshetra district administration had imposed Section 144 of the Indian Penal Code and police laid 54 check posts to stop the farmers, but they had managed to reach Pipli, where force was used against them on September 10.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farm-front-says-haryana-govt-has-double-standards-in-action-against-officials/articleshow/86101352.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Despite CMO’s denial, e-file on planned law surfaces in govt system||Thiruvananthapuram: Even as the chief minister’s office has denied the existence of any government file regarding the framing of an act to curb organised crime in the state, the government’s e-file system shows that there is a live file on the matter under circulation in the home department. As per the secretariat’s e-file system data, the file –– ‘Home-M2/149/2021-Home’ on ‘Kerala organised crime control act’ –– was opened in the home department on June 22. The file that has been seen by additional chief secretary (home and vigilance) T K Jose, has been transacted in various official levels too. On September 6, the file was with a section assistant in the home department. Denying the existence of any such file, the CMO had said that there is a demand from various corners for framing a law to curb organised crime and a committee has been set up for examining suggestions. The committee includes the chief secretary, additional chief secretary (home and vigilance), law secretary and former additional advocate general and presently senior legal counsel in the CMO, K K Raveendranath. As per the order constituting this committee on August 26, the committee has been asked to study and submit a report on the proposed draft legislation in a time-bound manner. The first meeting of the committee scheduled for Friday has been postponed. “The idea of framing such an act was mooted when the gold smuggling issue came up last year. The then state police chief had proposed framing an act on the lines of the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act, 1999, (MCOCA). However, the powers of telephone interception were excluded from the proposed legislation as there are already laid out rules and procedures for legally intercepting telephone conversations,” sources said. As per the section 14(1) of MCOCA, a police officer not below the rank of SP supervising the investigation of an organised crime should submit an application in writing to the competent authority for an order authorising or approving the interception of wire, electronic or oral communication by the investigating officer when such interception may provide or has provided evidence of any offence involving an organised crime. However, experts question the very requirement of such an act, even if the powers for phone tapping are removed, in the state. “There are laws in abundance that have provisions to curb any kind of crime, including terrorist activities. But the issue is that those are not effectively used. If the police are unable to act effectively, the framing of new laws would be a futile exercise. Also, if there are provisions for call interception in the new law, it can be used as a political weapon and lead to misuse,” former DGP and former chief of state crime branch Vinson M Paul said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/despite-cmos-denial-e-file-on-planned-law-surfaces-in-govt-system/articleshow/86101353.cms||KP Saikiran
---||Jaipur||Mewat conmen using social media to blackmail victims||Jaipur: Conmen of Mewat region, comprising Alwar and some parts of Bharatpur, continuously change their ways and modus operandi. Known for cheating people on pretext of selling them fake gold bricks, they would cheat and blackmail people on pretext of selling various commodities on OLX. Now, they create fake social media profiles of women, send them friend requests and after becoming friends, exchange numbers and ask them to send their semi-naked videos and pictures. Those who get trapped end up being blackmailed and paying hefty sums of money to them. A day after Alwar police busted a gang involved in similar malpractice, TOI on Tuesday spoke to the authorities to know more details about these gangs that use social media to cheat and blackmail people. “In past one year, we have busted more than 60 gangs and surprisingly, majority of those arrested were secondary or senior secondary pass, but were into creating fake profiles of women and girls. We have witnessed cases in which lawyers, businessmen and doctors became their victims not only from Rajasthan but also from various other parts of the country,” said Tejaswini Gautam, superintendent of police, Alwar while talking to TOI. She warned people that before approving a friend request on social media, a person should be cautious and should not go to the extent of being intimate with these ‘friends’. “Firstly, they will have a beautiful profile picture of a woman and will have the name of a woman on their profile. Then, they will send a friend request. After being ‘friends’ they will send them a personal message on the messenger and will ask for their mobile number having WhatsApp installed. Then, they will promise these people to get in touch with women and girls and ask them to send their semi-naked pictures or videos. Those who fall for the trap get conned,” said a senior police officer of Alwar district, who has been part of almost 30 such investigations. It was also mentioned by the senior police officers from Dausa and Bharatpur that these gang members keep boys aged 12 to 14 years in their gang so that they may mimic the voice of a woman while interacting with their targets. Alwar police had received complaints from Nepal, Mumbai, Telangana and other parts of the country.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/mewat-conmen-using-social-media-to-blackmail-victims/articleshow/86101931.cms||Ashish Mehta
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: SUV owner gets traffic challan for not wearing helmet||LUCKNOW: A high court lawyer was in for a shock when he went for a de-hypothecation of his four-wheeler here. The owner, PK Punhani, a resident of Mahanagar, was told that he has a challan to clear. Interestingly, on the challan instead of his hatchback SUV a photo of a motorcycle was found and the challan read that it was done as the rider was not wearing helmet. The registration number of the motorcycle and his car was the same. Punhani further said that despite the discrepancy he paid the challan of Rs 500. However, he said that in a police commissionerate with ITMS in place how such an error can be committed. The registration certificate on Punhani’s vehicle read that it was purchased in September 2016 as a result it was well in the records of the NIC which is integrated with the challan system in the city.  “It could be the handiwork of some hackers who could have tampered with the database,” the lawyer claimed. The traffic police were baffled when TOI sought information about the same. Traffic officials claimed that such errors occurred when the registration number of a vehicle was changed. DCP, traffic, Raees Akhtar said that he would look into the issue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/suv-owner-gets-traffic-challan-for-not-wearing-helmet/articleshow/86101924.cms||---

The Bhupesh Baghel government has included all seven districts of the Maoist-hit Bastar division in its ‘Millet Mission’ launched on Friday. The state is even offering incentives to paddy farmers to switch to millet. “We will invest Rs 170 crore over the next five years in Millet Mission. Farmers growing kodo-kutki and ragi crops will be given an input assistance of Rs 9,000 per acre and those choosing these crops instead of paddy will get Rs 10,000 per acre,” the CM said. Chhattisgarh is the first state to give input assistance for millet. It has fixed support price for kodo-kutki at Rs 3,000 per quintal. The government signed an MoU with the Hyderabad-based Indian Institute of Millet Research (IIMR) for technical knowhow and to train farmers to turn Chhattisgarh into a ‘millet hub’. “Like minor forest produce, we want to make small grain crops also the strength of Chhattisgarh. It will give a new identity to the state,” CM Baghel saidat the signing of the MoU.Kodo-kutki, ragi are grown in 20 districts of Chhattisgarh. In the first phase, MoUs were signed with 14 of them -- Bastar division’s Kanker, Kondagaon, Bastar, Dantewada, Bijapur, Sukma, and Narayanpur, plus Rajnandgaon, Kawardha, Gaurela-Pendra-Marwahi, Balrampur, Koriya, Surajpur and Jashpur. IIMR director Dr. Vilas A Tonapi said: “The year 2023 will be celebrated as International Year of Millet and Chhattisgarh’s Millet Mission will have made a mark in the country by then.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bastar-dists-at-core-of-chhattisgarhs-millet-mission/articleshow/86105611.cms||---
---||Lucknow||Lucknow: Reality check spots admin napping, mosquitoes buzzing||LUCKNOW: Vacant plots, lawns, water troughs, choked drains and garbage piles at many places in the city are acting as happy breeding grounds for mosquitoes, posing threat of further rise in dengue and other vector borne diseases, a TOI reality check revealed. After recording more than 30 dengue cases in the couple of weeks, authorities said that they have stepped up the drive against mosquitoes, but residents at several localities complained about no or less than required fogging or anti-larvae spraying. TimesViewAfter cholera and typhoid, dengue cases are surfacing in the city. All these diseases are linked to poor cleanliness. Common refrain of the people is that their complaints regarding garbage dumps and water puddles are not being addressed. Rather than a knee jerk reaction, civic agencies must devise a method using the smart city control room for effective redressal of the complaints.The water accumulation was found on the main road as well as inner streets and plots in Faizullaganj, Indiranagar, Gomtinagar extension, Rajajipuram, Jankipuram, Ashiana, Kanpur Road, LDA colony Kanpur Road, Gomtinagar, Nishatganj and Aminabad. In Faizullaganj, LDA colony, Ashiana and Kanpur Road, people are full of anger over the neglect by civic authorities. They claim workers do not take steps to clean the area on their own nor do they pay heed to the requests by residents. Mosquitoes are buzzing in lawns, flowerpots, vacant plots and in open drains. Similarly, in other areas like Rajajipuram, Gomtinagar, Aminabad, residents complain that LMC workers come once in a while for fogging and health teams only come for anti-larvae sprinkle when someone gets dengue. Earlier on September 4, the health department and the district administration officials had claimed they identified 11 hotspots in the city for dengue/malaria where fogging is being conducted twice a day and anti-larvae spray is also being done. However, of these 11 localities TOI checked five, where residents claimed such activities have not been up to the mark. However, chief medical officer Dr Manoj Agrawal denied the charges. He said, "We are conducting drives in full swing. Since the areas are vast so there might be some delay but fogging and anti-larvae sprinkling is being continuously performed. We have also issued helpline numbers so that people can choose these activities on demand.” Besides, he said, rapid response teams had been set up to ensure dengue patients get medical kits just as was done in case of Covid-19. LMC officials also said that regular fogging and garbage collection is being done.

Dotasara said that today such people are in the power of the country who are frauds. These people are cheating every section, including farmers, youth, unemployed. I have not called these people frauds just for the sake of it. They are doing fraud in the name of Ram temple also, he said. RSS people are seen demanding Rs 20 crore bribe at Bharti Bhavan. One is in jail and the whereabouts of one are not known. Dotasra was talking to the media at the state Congress headquarters on Friday. Dotasra said Ram temple is being built on the orders of the Supreme Court. “All the 130 crore people of the country are building Ram Mandir. BJP is doing the work of stealing funds from the trust and spreading falsehoods.” He asked who is denying the slogan of 'Jai Shri Ram'? Dotasra said BJP-RSS people have no contribution in the freedom movement. They are spreading lies in the country. They won the election by hiding behind the valour of the Army and started harassing the public. They have no answer to price rise, unemployment but only trying to polarise the people on the basis of religion, he said. He said to remove these frauds from power, the Congress would run a campaign across the country. “Will tell the history of Congress to the people of the country. Till we do not tell the history of Congress to the public, these frauds will continue to mislead the public,” he said.

On a tip-off from the transport operator, the ACB team under the direction of Kailash Vishnoi laid a trap. The team members sat with the three different container drivers and gave them marked currency notes. On the highway when the trucks entered Rajasthan Border, the accused stopped the trucks and demanded money. The sub inspector Mohammed Tausif, Guard Banshilal Meena and Rakesh Meena were caught red handed while accepting the bribe. An amount of Rs 1,11,400 was also recovered from the accused. The team is investigating the source of this amount. The drivers and the transport operators have lodged several complaints earlier regarding forceful extortion by the inspectors and guards of the transport department on Rajasthan Border. Thousands of trucks ply on this highway on a daily basis. In 2020 the ACB team had seized more than Rs 2.5 lac from the staff of Transport department and arrested four persons including sub inspector.

---||Chandigarh||Farmer’s death: No autopsy to be a challenge in probe||Chandigarh: Farmers might just be on the backfoot when it comes to their demand for registering a murder case in connection with the death of a farmer just hours after the police lathicharge in Karnal’s Bastara toll plaza on August 28. This is because deceased Sushil Kajal’s body was cremated without an autopsy, say farm leaders. The farmers’ protest to demand the registration of a case, being staged outside Karnal mini secretariat, entered the fourth day on Friday. Kajal (45), a resident of Rajput Jaitan, died on August 28 night, the day police cane-charged farmers at Bastara toll plaza. According to farmers and his family members, Kajal had suffered injuries during the lathicharge and he succumbed to injuries. Since then, farmers have been pressing for the registration of a case of murder and attempt to murder against former Karnal SDM Ayush Sinha, who was duty magistrate on the day of the incident. The demand for action against Sinha is being made as a video of him asking the cops to break the heads of farmers at the protest had gone viral. Farmers have alleged that Kajal’s death was consequent to the lathicharge and no immediate treatment at the local civil hosital. Kajal’s family and farmers admit to having cremated the body without an autopsy or any kind of inquest proceedings. Farmer leaders too admit to a cremation without autopsy. Inquest proceedings, including autopsy, are the most important part of a murder probe. Cremation without autopsy, which is largely seen as conspiracy for destruction of evidence, could invite action against a person under Section 201 (destruction of evidence) of IPC. Though not willing to be named, police officers said a probe was already underway. Sanyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) member Yogender Yadav said the registration of an FIR was the first requirement for probing the case. “Once investigation starts, reality will come out. This will bring the truth behind all allegations. See, there was a lathicharge. The officer whose video had gone viral was present at the spot where farmers were attacked in Bastara. A farmer died within hours of lathicharge. Why is the government not taking this in the interest of justice?” he said . Yadav added the remaining details would be revealed only when the probe would start. Farmers are also demanding a compensation of Rs 25 lakh and a government job for one member of Kajal’s family and Rs 2 lakh person to those who were injured.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/farmers-death-no-autopsy-to-be-a-challenge-in-probe/articleshow/86101364.cms||Manvir Saini
---||Lucknow||Kisan Morcha meet: BJP to chalk out plan to allay fears on farm laws||LUCKNOW: The three farm laws that triggered unrest among farmers are set to figure prominently in the crucial working committee meeting of UP BJP Kisan Morcha at Chitrakoot on Saturday. Sources said, the committee is expected to hammer out a roadmap to allay apprehensions of the farming community on the three laws, which potentially allowed Opposition to position itself against BJP in the run-up to the assembly elections early next year. President of UP Kisan Morcha, Kameshwar Singh, told TOI that farmers are being misguided by Opposition parties for their own political goals. “The laws are beneficial to farmers and our cadre will spread the word widely,” he said, adding BJP will neutralize Opposition’s propaganda that minimum support price (MSP) has been scrapped. The inaugural session of the committee will be addressed by UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh in presence of BJP national president of Kisan Morcha, Raj Kumar Chahar. Party national vice-president and UP in charge Radha Mohan Singh will address the concluding session. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath is unlikely to attend the meet, sources said. The political resolutions and campaign strategy will be announced by UP BJP state general secretary (organisation) Sunil Bansal. BJP’s farmer working committee meet comes almost a week after thousands of farmers came together to hold a ‘mahapanchayat’ in Muzaffarnagar on September 5, arming the opposition to attack the ruling regime. The ‘mahapanchayat’ assumed political significance as it was organised under the aegis of Sanyukt Kisan Morcha that comprises Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU), an outfit with sway over 125 assembly seats in west UP. Not surprisingly, the opposition openly backed the ‘mahapanchayat’ with BSP supremo Mayawati terming it an apt display of Hindu-Muslim unity in Muzaffarnagar — a city wracked by riots in 2013. A year later, BJP came to power at the Centre. Kameshwar Singh, however, maintained that the farming community has always backed BJP. He said, besides dispelling misconceptions about the three laws, the party will spread awareness on steps taken by the Centre and the UP government in favour the farming community. He said, schemes like PM Kisan Samman Nidhi envisaging grant of Rs 6,000 per annum to small and marginal farmers, PM farm insurance scheme, increased procurement of wheat and higher payment of cane price have worked in favour of the farming community.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/bjp-to-chalk-out-plan-to-allay-fears-on-farm-laws/articleshow/86101975.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Narcotics don’t have the colour of a religion, it is anti-social: Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan||THIRUVANANTHAPURAM/KOCHI: As the narcotic jihad remark by Pala Bishop Mar Bishop Mar Joseph Kallarangatt led to a controversy, CM Pinarayi Vijayan termed him a respected religious scholar who has good influence on society. “Not trying to create divisions is important in such matters. Narcotic jihad is a term that we are hearing for the first time. The issue with narcotics is that it is not an issue that affects a particular religion, but the society as a whole. Hence, all of us have a concern and we are taking all possible steps to curb the menace,” he said. Narcotics don’t have the colour of a particular religion; instead it has the colour of anti-socialism. No religion encourages drugs. It is unclear what he intended while making that statement and the circumstances under which he said so. But, those who are in responsible positions, while dealing with such matters, should be careful in ensuring that a religious divide is not caused, he added. Opposition leader slams bishopOpposition leader VD Satheesan too opposed the bishop’s view that Catholic girls and youths are being victimised by narcotic jihadists. “Religious heads and community leaders shouldn’t issue such statements that can destabilize communal harmony of state. There is no caste or religion for a crime. All crimes are equally gruesome and no attempt should be made to give crime a religious colour,” he said. A humble request to all religious heads and community leaders is that no crime should be bifurcated in the name of religion to disturb peace. It is not justifiable to target a particular community in the name of a crime. The statement made by Pala bishop was unfortunate as it exceeded the limit. Religious heads should ensure peace and harmony in society, he said, adding that the controversy should end here. Comment sad: PT ThomasSenior congress leader and MLA from Thrikkakara PT Thomas on Friday said that no one should fuel a division between communities. “Mar Joseph Kallarangat, the bishop of Pala is a significant personality. All are quite astonished about such a statement coming from a person of his stature. This statement is very sad and we need worry that it will inflict a deep wound in the secular nature of the society,” said Thomas. He said that in the modern era, criminals are not formed on the basis of religion or caste. BJP backs bishop KallarangattBJP state president K Surendran has expressed surprise over the criticism by a set of political leaders and religious organisations against Pala bishop Mar Joseph Kallarangatt’s statement that Catholic families should be wary of ‘narcotic jihad’. “I don’t understand why there is such an intolerance against the opinion expressed by the bishop. His worries that he shared with laity should be examined, instead of criticising him for speaking up his mind. Narcotic terrorism is powerful in Kerala as elsewhere in the world. Drug mafia and terror organisations work hand in glove. What Pala bishop said is not an opinion. The link between drug mafia and terrorist groups is a plain truth,” Surendran said. He said the demand to ostracise Pala bishop for speaking against love jihad and narcotic jihad was strange and illogical. BJP leader and national minority commission former vice-chairman George Kurian also came out supporting the views expressed by the bishop. “Syro-Malabar Church’s commission for vigilance and communal harmony had studied the issue in 2009. One Fr Johny, who led the study, had come out with the report that as many as 2,686 Christian girls had converted to Islam during 2006-2009 period,” he claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/narcotics-dont-have-the-colour-of-a-religion-it-is-anti-social-pinarayi/articleshow/86101393.cms||---

Locals claimed that three cases of thefts had taken place in their village, following which they were on alert. Police said that they had received a mobile phone from the suspect but did not find any SIM in it, thereby raising suspicion that it could be a stolen mobile. Officials said while the youth claimed himself to be Rahul, they have not recovered any document which could corroborate his identity. “We have conducted a medical examination of the suspect. He did not answer any questions related to his whereabouts. We are trying to examine if he is indeed from Assam,” an official said. Locals told police that they had spotted four suspects moving quietly around a farm behind a house and quickly surrounded them. While three of them fled, villagers said they caught one person and tied him so that he could not flee.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/people-beat-up-youth-on-suspicion-of-being-thief-in-alwar-hamlet/articleshow/86101974.cms||---

The sailors were stranded as the company that originally owned the ship sold it to another firm, which was pressuring the crew to take it to Libya. Sanjeev Singh Rathore of Udaipur on arrival said that the company kept on giving mental torture but they did not give up. We were stranded at the Cyprus port because of the agreement between the two companies. We struggled for 8 days. Sanjeev says that all the 10 crew members reached Farsud port in Norway by flight from India on May 30. After this, the ship reached Famagusta in Cyprus after loading the cargo via Harveys port in UK. In the meantime, the ship was sold by the Norwegian Sea Cargo Company to the Atalitas Sewage Company. Representatives of the new company were constantly pressurizing us to go to Tripoli port in Syria. The crew members were not being allowed to disembark from the ship and were under pressure to take the ship to a port that is in a war zone in Libya. We did not want to go to Syria according to the Indian guidelines said Sanjeev. The company first stopped our salary and in order to create mental pressure, they even stopped our food and water. Our request to send us back home was ignored. We had to survive without food for four days and drank sea water. Sanjeev said that Captain Sanjay Parashar, Abhimanyu Soni and Abhijeet Sangle, All India President for Sea Farer played an important role in our return back home. Sanjeev had called his wife on WhatsApp and told her about the grave conditions he and other crew members are facing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/udaipur/sailor-who-was-stuck-in-cyprus-returns-home/articleshow/86102012.cms||---

Yogi made the statement at a function organized to mark the 134th birth anniversary of Pant at Lok Bhawan, in Lucknow. The CM said that the event is being organized in the series of Amrit Mahotsav of Azadi and Chauri-Chaura Centenary Celebrations – an initiative of PM Narendra Modi. The CM said that during the regime of Pant, UP was the largest economy of the country and the per capita income of the state was equal to the per capita income of the country. “But in subsequent years, the per capita income of the state fell dramatically and in 2015-16, the per capita income of the state was reduced to one third,” he said. Yogi said that the state government was taking UP on the path of development, while drawing inspiration from the multi-faceted leadership of Pant and his contribution towards the country and society. “During the last four years, UP has become the second economy of the country,” he said. He hailed Pant for participating in all the freedom movements including the Non-Cooperation Movement in 1921, Quit India Movement in 1942. “Govind Ballabh Pant ji made the freedom movement a part of his life,” he said. He added that the state benefitted from leadership of Pant from 1937 to 1939 before independence and from 1947 to 1954 after independence. In 1939, he resigned from the post of CM due to the British Government’s involvement of India with World War II. He said that after independence, in 1947, Pant again became the CM of UP. Former MP and daughter-in-law of Govind Ballabh Pant, Ila Pant said the purpose of this programme is to make the youth aware that freedom was not easily attained but was achieved through continuous movements for 100 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-was-the-largest-economy-during-pants-regime-yogi/articleshow/86101999.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

He told TOI that the decision was taken after receiving an LIT resolution recommending it. “We have cancelled it. The probe will continue,” the local government minister said on Friday. Earlier, he had confirmed that the principal secretary, local government, had been asked to probe the matter. On August 16, 29 properties of LIT were auctioned at Rs 129 crore. Of these, a prime land measuring 16,344 square yards was auctioned for Rs 98 crore and it was alleged that its market value was around Rs 350 crore, leading to a row, LIT chairman Raman Balasubramanium had claimed that rates of property were not fixed by a deputy commissioner-led committee. The DC, however, had refuted the claims. The minister said, “We have taken a serious note of it. Case files are being prepared. I have asked principal secretary, local government, to personally look into the matter and take action. The issue is being probed for the past about three days.” Asked if vigilance probe could be ordered, as is being demanded by the opposition parties, he replied “Let the files come.” Regarding reauction, he said, “That will be for the LIT to decide.” The minister added, “Whosoever is found guilty, we will take action against them. We have asked for a report from the Ludhiana deputy commissioner.” A report has also been sought on the role of the DC, he indicated. “Those involved in the scam should be punished. Guilty LIT officials should be booked and sent to jail. The earnest money of the parties should be held and deposited in government treasury,” said district president of AAP, Ludhiana (urban), Suresh Goyal. “It is good that they have cancelled it. But how did they allow it? Action should be taken against the persons involved in the scam. It wouldn’t have been possible without the involvement of officials,” said SAD district president Ranjit Singh Dhillon. LIT chief questions allotment during BJP’s tenure:A day after BJP leaders locked the LIT office, chairman Raman Balasubramanium hit back on Friday, claiming when the saffron party had its chairman in LIT, it party took land in Model Town Extension Part 2 in Block D for building an office at subsidised rates. Now they are levelling allegations against him even when he had auctioned the land in transparent manne, he alleged. Recommended deal cancellation: AshuWhile the opposition parties have filed a complaint with the Enforcement Directorate, CBI and other authorities alleging corruption in the recent auctions by LIT, food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu, who has been quiet on the issue for more than a week, on Friday said that he has recommended cancellation of the auction to the Punjab government.SAD and BJP, who had been raising the issue, said the minister had to take the step following their complaint. Ashu, who has tweeted about it, said, “A lot of hue and cry has been raised by the opposition without checking the facts. Even as there is no foul play in the auction, I have asked the Punjab government to cancel it, just to come out clean and transparent on the issue. I have requested for a re-auction of this land. Those who were offering more money can participate in it.” Balasubramanium refuted the SAD and the BJP allegations and said, “I have said it earlier also, final call is to be taken at government level. If auction gets cancelled, I have no issue with it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/lits-model-town-extn-land-auction-is-cancelled/articleshow/86100719.cms||Shariq Majeed

---||Kochi||Kerala: Muslim outfit files police complaint against Pala bishop||KOTTAYAM: The Kottayam Taluk Mahallu Muslim Coordination committee lodged a complaint with the Kottayam Police chief D Shilpa against the bishop of Pala diocese Mar Joseph Kallarangatt for making “communal statements”. The complaint also says that IPC 153 A, which is non-bailable, should be charged against the bishop. The leaders of the coordination committee in a press conference here on Friday condemned the bishop for raising allegations by linking a highly respected idea in a sacred book of a religion to inappropriate situations. The leaders also alleged that the Bishop was intentionally trying to create a communal polarisation by saying that ‘jihadi terrorists’ in the state are resorting to ‘love jihad’ and ‘narcotic jihad’, targeting Christian youth. They alleged that the new allegation was aimed at diverting the differences and resentment in the Christian community over the uniform code for conducting mass and also eyeing the concessions given by the BJP government for promoting Christian-Muslim rivalry. They also said that when a religious leader like the bishop raises such serious allegations, which none of the investigating agencies have found, he is responsible to say where it has happened and who the victims were and which agency was convinced about this. He also has the responsibility to say where he has given a complaint regarding this. They said that the courts as well as investigation agencies have dismissed allegations about love jihad several times. They also said that baseless allegations have been coming up in the state against ‘jihad’ which is a highly respected idea in Islam, by linking that idea to terrorism. The allegations by the bishop is one such, they said. Meanwhile, Muslim Aikya Vedi took out a protest march to the Bishop’s House in Pala on Friday evening. The march which began from Lalam Junction was stopped by police near the house. Popular Front district president Suneer Moulavi Al Khasimi said that such allegations by religious leaders will disrupt the peaceful atmosphere in the state and will lead to communal polarisation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/muslim-outfit-files-police-plaint-against-pala-bishop/articleshow/86101424.cms||---

As part of this system, being introduced as per directions of Home Minister Amit Shah, the next posting of a jawan or officer shall be decided as per a point-based system or weightage linked to his previous postings. Shah had, after taking over in 2019, visualised a posting and transfer system for central armed police forces (CAPFs) that would eliminate scope for any arbitrariness or bias on the part of seniors by introducing a software-based personnel policy and minimising human interface. Software would also ensure that no personnel has to serve in a ‘hard’ posting for long periods and gets a ‘soft’ posting breather in between.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/software-to-help-paramilitary-forces-in-transparent-postings/articleshow/86105698.cms||Bharti Jain

The VACB search named ‘Operation number seven’ that connotes the number seven register that is also called the tree register, found several irregularities that are helping law breakers to illegally fell trees from assigned land. The VACB found that 17 village offices in Wayanad, Kozhikode, Kannur, Thrissur, Ernakulam and Alappuzha are not maintaining the tree register at all. It also found that in 12 villages in Wayanad, Alappuzha, Kollam and Thiruvananthapuram, the title registers are not maintained. The VACB team mainly examined if the applications submitted by the land assignees in the village offices have specified the type of the trees that can be felled, whether the names of those have been properly listed in the document issued from the village offices, whether the location sketches are properly prepared, whether the declaration form that shows the type of the land has been properly examined by the forests department and whether the details of the trees that have been felled from each village limit has been properly documented. The searches were conducted on the basis of a report from ADGP (crimes) S Sreejith under whom a team is probing the illegal tree felling case at Muttil in Wayanad.

As the police reached the spot after being alerted by neighbours, the body was still in flames. Leela told the police that she committed the crime as her mother was not letting her sleep for the past few days. The police suspect that Leela was not in her senses when she committed the murder.

---||Lucknow||To take on BJP, Congress plans RSS style cadre-based army||LUCKNOW: Taking a leaf out of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh book, the Congress is busy creating ideology-oriented workers’ base in Uttar Pradesh in the run-up to the high-voltage state polls. The Congress leadership believes that it is perhaps the only way to counter the 'false agenda' propagated by the RSS and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). To begin with, the party is conducting a training programme of its committed workers. As part of the training, the workers are being handed over a booklet, which has 14 chapters, each delving into details the 'lies and insinuations spread by the BJP-RSS combine and the truth behind it'. The first such ‘insinuation' which finds mention in the booklet is about the propaganda that Congress supports anti-nationals while the BJP is a nationalist party. The next popular BJP 'propaganda' included in the booklet is: ‘Jawahar Lal Nehru did not allow Sardar Ballabh Bhai Patel to become the Prime Minister’. Others include, “Had Patel been the PM, the country wouldn’t have faced many issues”; “Congress did nothing in the past 70 years”; “Mahatma Gandhi and the Congress leaders did nothing to stop Bhagat Singh from being hanged”; “Nehru kept Kashmir separated from India by implementing Article 370”; “Congress was responsible for atrocities on Kashmiri pundits”; “Congress offered biryani to terrorists”; “Congress only propagated dynasty politics”, etc. Titled as ‘Hum Congress ke log, dushprachaar aur sacch’, the booklet goes on to give detailed explanations on each of the above mentioned lies. “We need ideology-based workers to counter meaningless propaganda like ‘Jawahar Lal Nehru was a Muslim’,” a senior leader, privy to the training module, told TOI. “Otherwise also, centrist or leader-Centric approach has not been paying dividends organizationally in UP for the past over three decades. Hence, we are now making efforts to build an RSS-like organisation in the run up to assembly elections 2022,” he said. The concept, he said, had already paid dividends in Chhattisgarh, where the Congress is running a successful government under chief minister Bhupesh Bhagel. In Chhattisgarh, the cadre-based structure has been created till gram panchayat level. “It was divided into three segments. While social media was looked after by former journalist and now Congress leader Vinod Verma, booth and gram panchayat level structure formation was done under the guidance of Congress secretary Rajesh Tiwari. The political structuring was carried out under the leadership of former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s niece late Karuna Shanker Shukla,” said another Congress leader. Training of workers from UP Congress was also carried out in Chhattisgarh under the guidance of Rajesh Tiwari, who was also parliamentary advisor to CM Baghel. After his elevation to the post of All India Congress Committee (AICC) secretary, Tiwari has been attached to Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s team. The overall training of the workers from Uttar Pradesh is also being looked after by Sandeep Singh, the political advisor to Priyanka. A senior Congress leader, preferring anonymity, said the training of Congress workers has been completed until block level. “Now, workers at gram panchayat and nyaya panchayat level will get the training. Of over 60,000 village panchayats, training of around 18,000 have been completed. Remaining training is likely to be completed by September 20,” the Congress leader said. Another leader close to Priyanka, who is on a visit to Lucknow right now, said the party aims to create around 2 lakh cadre-based workers by November end.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/to-take-on-bjp-cong-plans-rss-style-cadre-based-army/articleshow/86102053.cms||Rajiv Srivastava
---||Lucknow||On Day 1, Priyanka Gandhi releases poll promo projecting Congress as only option in UP||LUCKNOW: Projecting itself as the only hope for Uttar Pradesh, the Congress on Friday released an election promo, during its two-day review meeting presided over by party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. The video, being circulated by the party cadre, presents Congress as the only option against what they called the ‘divisive cult of politics that hovers around caste, class and religion’. The promo also showcases the failures of the ruling BJP government, and blames it for the problems being faced by the people. The election and strategy units of the UP Congress also announced to launch ‘Congress Pratigya Yatra – Ham Vachan Nibhayenge’, a massive public connect drive. The Yatra, leaders said, will work towards reviving the party’s bond with the people. Priyanka discussed in detail the route map of the yatra that will traverse through 12,000 kilometres across the length and breadth of UP. Activities around the campaign such as street plays, night halts in cities and villages were also finalized. UPCC spokesperson Sachin Rawat said that every unit of the Congress has been asked to join the drive and expose the BJP government. “The public sentiment is against the ruling party and the Yatra will provide people a platform to voice their feelings. We will try to explain to them why Congress should be the only alternative for them,” Rawat said. UPCC chief Ajay Kumar Lallu said the party has been able to build the cadre over the past one and a half years. “Over 831 block-level and 8134 nyay panchayat level committees have been formed. The process to appoint ward level committees is in the final stages,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/on-day-1-priyanka-releases-poll-promo-projecting-cong-as-only-option-in-up/articleshow/86102062.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Delhi||Man denied bail in contraband possession case||New Delhi: A Delhi court has dismissed the bail plea of a man arrested for allegedly possessing contraband, saying no grounds were made out. It, however, said that it was important to note that during the hearing of the plea, the counsel for the accused had shown a video footage and contended that the accused was apprehended at 4pm, though in the FIR, police had stated the time of arrest to be 8pm. “It is important to assume that, while the bail application was argued on September 2, the counsel for the accused had shown certain video clippings and contended that the accused was apprehended at around 4pm, and this video was shot from the neighbouring house of the accused where he is seen/escorted by a person, who is a police official. Secondly, there is one e-stamp paper, which was purchased by the accused at 4pm. Thirdly, the police team for the purpose of apprehension of the accused, has used one case that was registered in the name of assistant director, National Crime Bureau of Records (NCBR), and all these probabilism that the accused was already in the custody of police of Narcotic Branch and later proceedings were conducted just like a stage-managed manner,” additional sessions judge Sumit Dass said. The court added that since these facts had come up for the first time on September 2, it had directed the counsel for the accused to file the alleged video record so that the investigating officer/police team could suitably reply to the allegations. Advocates Kapil Madan and Gurmukh Singh Arora, appearing for the accused, had sought bail on medical grounds of his father and claimed that no contraband was recovered from his possession or at his instance as alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/man-denied-bail-in-contraband-possession-case/articleshow/86127529.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Corp to reinforce Covid measures at ward level||Thiruvananthapuram: The council meeting on Friday charted out an action plan to strengthen Covid precautions at ward level across the district. The plan includes formation of ward committees and neighbourhood forums to assess the needs of Covid patients at the ground level as well as to ensure that precautionary measures are strengthened against the third wave of the pandemic. The ward level committees will be formed in 100 wards in the district. These committees will include politicians, health workers, ward councillors and junior health inspectors. Meanwhile, neighbourhood forums will also rope in 250 residents associations into the initiative. A 10 member team constituted under these forums will include ASHA, kudumbashree and anganwadi workers. The aim of these forums would be to identify the patients, supply them with medication and essentials as well as ensure quarantine measures. District health standing committee chairperson P Jameela Sreedharan said the corporation aims at conducting surveys from September 15 to assess how much of the population between the age groups of 45 and 60 still require vaccination. After preparing a data bank the corporation will ensure that these people are vaccinated by the end of September. Several opposition councillors, including M R Gopan, Karamana Ajith from the BJP and P Padmakumar from the UDF, raised criticisms of the government’s role in handling the second and impending third wave of the pandemic. “People who are tested positive are being treated like criminals. This has created tensions at several places,” said Padmakumar. M R Gopan said the vaccination campaign had been less than successful. “There is no effort taken to ensure that the people tested positive are quarantined and also to track their contact list. There is also apathy in vaccinating people who need them. The corporation ambulances could not even handle the volume of patients testing positive,” he alleged. However, the comments were dismissed by Mayor Arya Rajendran who asserted that the state’s vaccination policy had been acknowledged as successful even by the Centre.“About three crore people in the state have been vaccinated so far. Over two lakh people in the 45-60 age groups have received the first dose. At present only 30% people from this group remain to be vaccinated which we will ensure in the coming weeks. In the district Covid cases are being contained as there has been a drop in cases,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/corp-to-reinforce-covid-measures-at-ward-level/articleshow/86100813.cms||---

She still remembers the kind of overwhelming response that the all-woman Kathakali troupe got after their performances at various stages in the US, a year after 9/11 terror attack. As a prelude to Dhuryodhana Vadham, Radhika used the intricate Kathakali mudras and facial expressions of ranging from pathos to anger in order to visualise the national tragedy and sorrow that followed after the terror attacks, and it drew applause from the audience. She had an opportunity to perform in the US as part of the all-woman Kathakali troupe from Tripunithura. “For a moment they felt September 11 was revisiting them and it sent shockwaves down their veins,” she recalls. The venue was the elegant stage of Smithsonian Institute of Historic Museum and Art Galleries at Washington DC, and on June 20, 2002, hardly a year after 9/11. “The traditional drum beats added fury and drama to the scene and the viewers were given a virtual experience through Kathakali,” she says. The troupe preformed Dhuryodhana Vadham, Geethopadesham, Kiraatham and Poothanaamoksham. “It was the Manodharmam (improvisation) of an accomplished artist in full flow and was well appreciated,” recalls Geetha Varma, a member who enacted the role of Dushaasana in Duryodhana Vadham. Prameela Vijayakumar, another member who played the role of Krishna, felt that the audience were sitting as though in a trance. “We repeated the same performance in all our remaining stages including Bridgewater temple, Chicago FOKANA and St Luis,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/all-woman-kathakali-troupe-recalls-enacting-9/11-attack/articleshow/86101465.cms||---

Asked why the committee set up by the university to probe the incident did not conduct online depositions, he said the students were already under a lot of stress and it was not the right time to send them notices for online depositions. A group of masked men armed with sticks and rods attacked students and teachers and damaged property on the university campus on January 5, 2020, prompting the university administration to call in police. “The committee is looking into the matter. It has to call the students for deposition. Is it the right time to call them when they are in their hometowns?

Acting on a KMC board of administrators (BoA) advisory, municipal commissioner Binod Kumar slapped show-cause notices on several buildings department assistant engineers for allegedly failing to prevent illegal constructions in various parts of the city. If the accused engineers fail to give satisfactory reply, the commissioner may send these cases to the civic body’s personnel department for initiating disciplinary proceedings. The KMC buildings department has also served notices to several promoters or individuals, asking them to produce legal papers relating to the construction of flats or buildings that are underway in different parts of the city. In fact, following a tweak in buildings rule and as instructed by the chairman of the KMC board of administrators Firhad Hakim, the civic buildings department brass has asked the executive engineers to keep tabs on every construction under their jurisdictions. “We have asked our borough executive engineers to rope in the assistant or sub-assistant engineers to keep a vigil on every construction in a borough. If they find anything suspicious, they must report the same to us without delay. We will check valid papers of the construction and start demolition of the illegal constructions within a week,” said a KMC buildings department senior official.  “We have prepared a preliminary list of under-construction buildings in some sensitive boroughs where a large number of buildings are constructed without caring for our building rules. We will then initiate a drive to demolish them,” said a KMC buildings department official.

A dedicated team of SKM UP was constituted in the meeting which will mobilise not just farmers but all other unions and organizations, including those of Dalits, women, labourers and teachers on September 17 ahead of the national body’s call for Bharat Bandh on September 27. Amid other decisions, the SKM UP has also decided to socially boycott BJP leaders, its allies and corporate giants, by showing them black flags and not letting their programmes take place. “SKM is a new experiment and UP is the first region to have a constituent body through which we plan to penetrate every house, town and village on issues such as repeal of three farm laws, exploitation of sugarcane farmers, rising electricity bill, stray animal menace, opening of toll plazas and demand for a reasonable hike in minimum support price (MSP),” said SKM leader Darshan Pal. Taking forward the ‘Mission Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand’, the farm leaders said that mobilisation will include holding several big rallies and mahapanchayats in UP ahead of elections. “Big rallies and mahapanchayats will be held in all 18 divisions and 75 districts of UP, on the lines of the Muzaffarnagar one. The BJP is using religion and caste to divide people who are all united for the farmer’s cause. We will not let that happen in UP and fight against both corporatisation and communalism,” said farmer leader Ashok Dhawale. “Mission UP is against the BJP government both at the state and central government that is exploitative in nature. We are not supporting any political party as of now but will decide upon an anti-BJP slogan in December,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/farmers-decide-to-step-up-heat-next-protest-on-sept-17/articleshow/86102090.cms||Yusra Husain

Officials from the state irrigation department said, “Rainfall activity in the catchments of dams in Khadakwasla circle has increased which has led to inflow of rain water in to reservoirs. We had brought down water stock in Khadakwasla up to 50% to accommodate water released from Varasgaon and Panshet. On Friday evening Khadakwasla’s stock increased to 78% as water from Varasgaon has started flowing into the reservoir.” The state irrigation department did not release water from Khadakwasla on Friday, however, officials said that water release will begin if catchments continue to receive heavy rains. “Stocks in all the three dams located upstream, Temghar, Panshet and Varasgaon, have reached near to full capacities. We are monitoring the water levels in the reservoirs. Besides, dams around Pune, all other major dams in the Bhima basin have received good rains in the last two days. The stock in five dams were at full capacities on Friday evening,” officials said. Kannad Ghat Road to open for light motor vehicles Despite the challenges resulting from incessant rainfall in the region, National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) plans to open the national highway passing through Outram Ghat of Kannad for light vehicles by September 15. However, heavy vehicles will be allowed to commute on this portion of national highway only by the end of this month. NHAI project director Avinash Kale told TOI, “We will open the highway for light vehicles on September 15, while for heavy vehicles, the highway can be opened only by month-end.” The officer said the repair work is underway on war footing, but incessant rainfall is adding to existing challenges. The Dhule-Aurangabad-Solapur national highway 211 that connects the states of Punjab, Rajasthan, Gujarat to central, western Maharashtra and several southern states, passes through the 10km-long stretch of the ghat.

---||Nagpur||Steroids need dose and duration regulation: Experts||NAGPUR: Experts in Covid treatment and administration of drugs have suggested highly judicious use of steroids which proved life-savers as well as caused serious complications. Senior faculty members from medical institutions and well-known medical practitioners stress regulating dose and duration of steroids and using drugs like Dexamethasone and Methlyprednisolone as per the time and situation. Experts believe that the alleged mismanagement of steroid therapies had triggered a sort of ‘mini pandemic’ in the form of fungal infections like mucormycosis which claimed lives and caused serious side-effects like loss of eyesight etc. Endogenous endophthalmitis too had come to fore as a possible side-effect of steroid after a Covid-recovered cop ended life due to the ailment. Professor and head of the department of medicine, AIIMS, Nagpur, Dr Prashant Joshi said that steroids save lives when Covid-19 patient is hypoxic. “If someone is maintaining SPO2 of 94% and above on room air, then there is no need of steroids. It is only to be given when SPO2 is 93% or less," said Dr Joshi. Dr Joshi further said that in diabetic patients, steroids can shoot up blood sugar level which is the chief cause of mucormycosis. “Proper blood sugar control is crucial,” said Dr Joshi who is also an expert on epidemiology. “Clinical trials show that steroids are not required for more than 10 days,” he said. Dr Kamal Bhutada, director of ICU at a private hospital and chairman of Indian Society for Critical Care Medicine, Nagpur chapter, said that he had used Dexamethasone in the second wave while it was Methylprednisolone in the first wave. “There are studies supporting the use and administration of Dexamethasone whose dose as per the guidelines is 6 mg per day for 10 days,” he said adding that steroid overuse can trigger fungal infections like mucormycosis and candida, also secondary drug-resistant bacterial infection, fluid retention in the body, muscle and bone weaknesses too. He said that patients requiring hospitalization with SPO2 saturation falling below 94% need steroids. Professor and head of medicine, Government Medical College and Hospital, Dr Prashant Patil said that state and health department guidelines must be followed but we need tailored and customized treatment for each patient. “In any case administration of steroids is not advisable for more than five to 10 days,” he said. Physician Dr Rajesh Atal said that giving steroids within seven days of infection when the viral load is high in the phase of viremia can lead to disaster. "Steroids must be introduced when the immuno-response is exaggerated. It is an immunosuppressrant and hence should be used in moderation and short duration just to tide over the crisis,” he said. Internal medicine specialist Dr Nitin Wadaskar, associated with Alexis Multispecialty Hospital, said that misuse or overuse of steroids led to opportunist pathogens to strike and secondary infections were on rise during the second wave. “If the C-Reactive protein (CRP) is found raised and CT score too is on the higher side, only then steroids can be introduced moderately,” said Dr Wadaskar adding that many patients had grown steroid dependent even after discharge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/steroids-need-dose-and-duration-regulation-experts/articleshow/86100838.cms||Soumitra Bose

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Witness can record statement via video conference in court||JAIPUR: A new chapter began in the subordinate courts in the state on Friday. Now, witnesses can record their statement in courts through video conference. The facility has been launched in Jaipur and Ganganagar district courts. The rules for the same were notified on August 2 this year amending the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). V Sarvan Kumar, special secretary, home department, said that the witness would be freed from recording the statement by appearing in a court after travelling several kilometres. Now, the witness will be able to go to the studio of the video conference remote point in the premises of the district court and make statement through it. In the first phase, all district courts would have studios by connecting them with video conference remote points. A coordinator, a court employee, has been appointed at these studios, he said. Kumar informed that video conference's hardware has been installed at 1,242 courts of the state. Microsoft team licence and fibre internet connectivity has been given. In the second phase, video conference remote points will be made in the taluka courts. Government offices and hospitals will also be connected to it. After notifying the rules of video conference by the high court, the witness statement can be done on time. Government expenditure and time will be saved and this would help to expeditious trial of cases. By completing the entire process with transparency, the pending cases of court cases will come down, he said. The procedure is adopted on the permission of the court. Once a court gives permission, a video conference slot is booked by the court officials. The witness has to go to the video conference remote point of the district court premises and testify.

The drive follows the gang-rape of a girl, in which most of the suspects are autorickshaw drivers. “On Thursday, we checked 740 autorickshaws for documents like valid permits and driving licence, badges, among others, and issued notices to 65 drivers for plying vehicles older than 15 years, needing scrapping or re-registry. Another 125 vehicles have been impounded and a fine of over Rs2 lakh has been recovered. On Friday, action was taken against 1,237 autorickshaw drivers for traffic rule violation by the traffic department,” deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Rahul Shrirame told TOI. Pune RTO official Ajit Shinde said their inspectors filed offences against 177 autorickshaw drivers and 25 vehicles were impounded. “The drive focused on two areas, including the Pune railway station. Being Ganesh Chaturthi, we did not go in full force as there are many people on the roads and they will need autorickshaws to travel,” Shinde said. Sources in the RTO office said the most common offences were related to not having proper documents. “Also, many were found without their badges and uniforms. The autorickshaw drivers should start following all the traffic regulations,” another RTO official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/drive-against-errant-drivers-starts-150-autos-impounded/articleshow/86101487.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Kolkata||BJP fields lawyer-activist against Mamata in Bhowanipore||Kolkata: The BJP on Friday fielded high court lawyer Priyanka Tibrewal against chief minister Mamata Banerjee in the Bhowanipore assembly bypoll. Tibrewal’s claim to prominence is her consistent legal role to bring to book culprits of post-poll violence in West Bengal that prompted the Calcutta High Court to order a court-monitored CBI investigation into complaints of murder, rape and violence against women and hand over the other criminal complaints to a Special Investigation Team under former HC Chief Justice Manjula Chellur. Tibrewal cut her teeth in electoral politics as BJP’s candidate from Entally assembly seat, where she lost to Trinamool Congress’ Swarna Kamal Saha by over 50,000 votes in the recently concluded assembly polls. At that time, the BJP candidate for Bhowanipore was actor-politician Rudranil Ghosh, who lost to Trinamool senior Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay by 28,000 votes. Tibrewal didn’t give up though. A member of BJP lawyers’ cell, Tibrewal began a solo legal battle in HC, taking up the cause of post-poll violence victims and their rehabilitation. This got her noticed by the BJP brass. Bengal BJP had proposed her name along with those of two others to the party brass in Delhi. BJP seniors in Bengal had been insisting on a woman candidate against CM Banerjee. Rudranil, pitted against Sobhandeb, had polled 35% votes in Bhowanipore. Union home minister Amit Shah had held a road show in his support while BJP president J P Nadda had gone on a door-to-door campaign. This time around, according to BJP leaders, star campaigners would be missing. BJP MLAs and MPs have planned a low-key but intensive campaign with emphasis on ‘chai pe addas’ in the morning and reaching out to voters’ houses. Tibrewal would be up against a tough challenge in contesting against CM Banerjee. Yet, Bengal BJP co-minder Amit Malviya had assigned responsibilities to booth-level party workers days ago. Party MPs would be in charge of various wards under the guidance of Barrackpore MP Arjun Singh, appointed BJP observer for Bhowanipore. BJP leaders’ expectations are low from wards 80 and 82, spread over Kidderpore and Chetla. They are banking on wards 70, 71 and 72 that have a mixed demography, one reason why Tibrewal was fielded. But the turnout this time is expected to be lower than four months ago. Back then, Trinamool winner Chattopadhyay had resigned from the assembly to make way for Banerjee, who had narrowly lost from Nandigram to BJP’s Suvendu Adhikari. Calling Bhowanipore bypoll a “high-voltage contest”, Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh said: “We defeated her (Banerjee) once in Nandigram. She became a non-MLA CM and is now in a hurry to get elected. We will use all our might to win the bypoll.” BJP also announced candidates for the other two other assembly bypoll seats. Milan Ghosh is the party’s candidate from Samserganj and Sujit Das from Jangipur, both in Murshidabad.

---||Kolkata||Released on bail, man attacked near jail by rivals; 25 arrested with arms||KOLKATA: Two of the notorious gangs of Kasba-Picnic Garden area — one led by Munna Pandey and the other by Biswajit Poddar alias Sona Pappu — came head-to-head on Thursday afternoon. Pandey was allegedly attacked and assaulted by the Pappu’s gang as soon as he stepped out of the Presidency Correctional Home after being released on bail. However, cops arrived in time to intervene and managed to save Pandey who was rushed to the SSKM Hospital. His condition was stated to be stable. The anti rowdy section of detective department nabbed as many as 25 of the accused, all residents of Rajdanga Main Road, Nabapally, Bediadanga and Swinhoe Lane. Several weapons, including arms, have been recovered from the accused. Twenty-five others, including Sona Pappu, were mentioned in the FIR with attempt to murder, rioting and criminal conspiracy charges being slapped on them. Cops said that raids were being conducted at Kasba, Tiljala and a few places in South and North 24 Parganas in search of the accused. Senior officers at Lalbazar said they cannot remember another instance in the recent past when an attempt to murder a gangster had been made in such a brazen manner. “The accused, led by Sona, wanted to kill their rival Munna of Bosepukur as soon as he stepped out of the jail after he was released on bail. They were armed with weapons like fire arms, sticks, iron rods, choppers, foldable sticks and bricks and attacked the complainant Munna around 2pm. A team from ARS, DD and local police, on being alerted about the incident, reached the spot and rescued Munna. We nabbed 25 people from the spot.

The construction was part of the civic body’s 24x7 water tank scheme. Experts said it was a notified forest area and the heaps of debris could be ecologically devastating. Tekdi walker Sushma Date, who has played an active role in saving Pune’s hills for many years, said, “The debris has been lying here for the last three years. The rubble is devastating for the ecology of the forest and is preventing new vegetative growth. Ever since the work began and the forest department stopped it, the debris has been lying on vast patches of the hill slope. The PMC has made zero efforts to remove it.” Date, along with others from the Deccan Gymkhana Parisar Samiti, recently wrote to the forest department to direct the PMC to remove the rubble on priority, citing further damage to the fragile ecosystem of the hill. Gurudas Nulkar, the trustee of Ecological Society, Pune, said, “This rubble consists of excavated soil, cement and brick debris. These are covering the top soil and so the seeds are unable to germinate and the microbiota is no longer active in the area.” Date said Pune’s tekdis provide the largest natural rain catchment area in Maharashtra, and this particular hill complex houses a large part of the largest aquifer system, which recharges groundwater in the Deccan area. Aniruddha Pawaskar, the chief engineer of PMC’s water supply department, said, “Once the tank reconstruction work is complete, a major chunk of the rubble will be used for the backfilling exercise and rest will be disposed off.”  “The land is owned by the PMC. Hence, we had started the construction of new water tanks here,” he said. However, the civic body was unaware a separate permission for deforestation was required. The work was then stopped on orders by the forest department. Pawaskar said that a formal proposal was sent to the Centre in 2018 for diversion of 0.7031 hectare reserved forest land in Survey 262 of the tekdi in favour of the water supply department for reconstruction of extra capacity water reservoirs. “We have recently got stage 1, in principal approval for the same. These tanks with capacity 18.5 million litre, will be distributing 66 million litre volume of water,” he said. Citizens said they were not against the construction of the water tanks. “If tanks must be built here, then the onus is on the PMC to make sure minimal damage is caused to this fragile ecosystem,” a citizen said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rubble-excavated-3-yrs-ago-remains-uncleared-on-hill/articleshow/86101495.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Lucknow||UP makes mid-term exams must for all universities, private institutions||LUCKNOW: All the universities, including private institutions, will conduct mid-term examinations in the academic session 2021-22 which is slated to commence from September 13. In its latest directives, the government has made mid-term examinations compulsory for students enrolled for all courses, irrespective of the system (semester or annual). The idea is to ensure that students do not suffer in case of any crisis situation like Covid-19 pandemic. “In case of unavoidable circumstances, the mid-term examination will help in timely promotion of students without causing any loss to them,” said the order issued by additional chief secretary, higher education, Monika S Garg. The directives are a part of the newly-released academic calendar for session 2021-22. As per the calendar, universities should close fresh admissions to first semester/year by September 13. To regularise academic session, which got derailed due to prolonged closure of educational institutions in wake of Covid-19 pandemic, the government has also asked institutions to cut down on winter vacation, if required. In addition, teachers may be given 15 days of summer vacation in shifts so that teaching-learning does not get unhamper. Universities have been instructed to approve only very important leaves, except maternity, of teaching and non-teaching staff. Condolence meetings of only teachers and administrative staff will be held on campus only after 3 pm. Prior to it, classes will take place on campus, the order said. The government has also instructed universities to hold extra/online classes if the total number of teaching days – 90 for semester system and 180 for annual system – are not met. Students should be convinced to use higher education digital library.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-makes-mid-term-exams-must-for-all-univs-private-institutions/articleshow/86102104.cms||Isha Jain

The family members and locals flocked around Ram Bahadur as he got out of the vehicle. His mother Kusuma and father Gilla were the first to embrace him. His sister Rani, who arrived from her in-laws’ place, with a `Rakhi', is also very happy. "I have tied Rakhi to my brother exactly after 12 years. All these years I have been eagerly waiting for him," said Rani. "His return is nothing less than a Diwali or a Holi for us", she added According to police, Ram Bahadur, a native of Banda's Pachokhar village in Tindwari town, who was suffering some psychological disorder, had illegally crossed over to Pakistan and was arrested on suspicion that he was an Indian spy. He was released by the Pakistani authorities on August 30. After being handed over to Punjab authorities, he arrived at his native village Pachokhar on Thursday, said a senior district official. Naib tehsildar Baberu Abhinav Tiwari and sub inspector of Atarra police station Sudhir Chaurasia accompanied Ram Bahadur to his village. Speaking to the media, his family members thanked the officials and the government for bringing him back to India. His brother Maiku told reporters that after Ram Bahadur had gone missing in 2009, they lodged a complaint at the local police station. “A case was registered in this regard and efforts were also made to trace him. Later, my family came to know in January 2021 that Ram Bahadur had been detained in Pakistan, he said. "We searched for him, but couldn’t find him. We presumed that he might have died in some accident. We were shocked when we came to know that he reached Pakistan, and was imprisoned there," Maiku further said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/man-missing-since-2009-returns-village-in-banda-after-spending-12-year-in-jail-in-pakistan/articleshow/86101494.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

The AAP government has informed Delhi high court, which had last month expressed concern over their plight, that interventions have been made to ensure that the children don’t suffer further. In a status report, the women and child department (WCD) on Thursday told the court that a financial assistance of Rs 30,000 had been given to the family with which the siblings were staying. The eldest sibling, 23 years old, is keen to pursue higher education. WCD has arranged Rs 25,000 as funds to pay her fees and other expenses for the B.Ed programme in which she is enrolled. On other welfare steps, the department said the minors were aged between 4-14 years. The youngest one goes to a nearby anganwadi centre run by the government where his nutritional, pre-school education and healthcare needs are being met. The second youngest sister, who is 21, has been drafted by the government as a worker in the same anganwadi set-up so that she can fulfil her duties while taking care of the boy, the report stated. The government said the initial offer was made to Devika, the eldest sibling who refused it, but requested that her younger sister be offered the job. “Further, six members of the family have been registered for monetary support under Mukhyamantri Covid 19 Parivaar Arthik Sahayata Yojana. A total assistance of Rs 5,000 each has already been remitted to three members of the family as monthly financial assistance,” the report stated. Delhi government has also facilitated suitable healthcare for one of the minors, who is suffering from TB, at a nearby government hospital, the department added in its report. The high court had earlier taken note of their ordeal as the siblings struggled to jmeet basic needs. A bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh had observed it would be unfair to expect the children to procure documents for availing benefits of the welfare schemes after losing their guardians. The high court said that since the schemes had been framed by Delhi government to grant benefits particularly to orphaned children, the authorities had to adopt a proactive approach rather than dealing with such applications in a routine manner as experienced in normal times when one had to deal with the bureaucracy. The high court was first informed by advocate Prabhsahay Kaur, representing NGO Bachpan Bachao Andolan, that during the second wave of the pandemic, the large family was orphaned with the death of their parents in April and May.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/seven-siblings-orphaned-during-second-wave-finding-feet-back/articleshow/86101515.cms||Abhinav Garg

Last year, we were holed up in our homes. We arrived in Delhi on Thursday on a quick visit. Our plan is to take the morning flight to Pune on Monday and join work the same day. Such quick getaways have become important, especially during these trying times,” he said. The passenger traffic at the Pune airport, which jumped to around one lakh in the first week of September, shows that a lot of people are travelling, taking advantage of the start of the festive season. “The number of flights has seen a rise, giving people more options to travel. Three new flights to Ranchi, Tirupati and Thiruvananthapuram have started, and the airport is witnessing a lot of arrivals and departures,” an airport official told TOI. “The passenger traffic (from September 1-8) has increased by 27% compared to the same period last month. The issue of crowding at the terminal building exists, but we are taking care of it and doing our best. We have had a detailed meeting with all airlines and other stakeholders on crowd control,” another official said. Nilesh Bhansali, director, Travel Agents Association of Pune, said short getaway destinations have picked up rapidly. “The maximum days that people want to stay is five. I have confirmed bookings for at least 80 people, who have either gone or are set to go to places like as Goa, Udaipur, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Coorg, Hyderabad etc,” he said. Some flyers, however, had complaints about the Pune airport. “They quickly need to do something about the security check area. I have travelled for business twice in the last 10 days and witnessed crowd and chaos each time,” Rachit Kayal, a business flyer, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/lohegaon-airports-passenger-traffic-up-ahead-of-festivals/articleshow/86101503.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: GMCH to get software to upload patient data||CHANDIGARH: While GMCH-32 has enhanced the number of patients from four per hour to eight a day for tele-consultation, it is also planning to procure Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS). This technology will enable the hospital to upload heavy files of X-Ray and MRI online. This system is currently not functional in PGI for all OPD patients. “We have been trying to get this software and hopefully it will be installed. This shall allow these investigations to be uploaded and we can do away with the hard copies,” said a senior faculty in GMCH-32. Already, the medical college and hospital has all investigations online, except for the radiology department. “Often, films and reports get misplaced and lost. With this software, it will be easy for doctors and patients to save data,” said a paramedical staff in PGI. As most consultations have been online during the pandemic, there has been considerable requirement for software to upload patient data. In such a situation, PACS can benefit both doctors and patients. “X-rays and MRI, CT scan etc can be uploaded as high quality image which can be 2D or even 3D. Old reports can be retrieved,” said a doctor in GMCH 32. Patients can pay the fee digitally and get themselves registered online in GMCH 32. “We are the only public hospital here to offer online appointments much before the pandemic. Therefore, doctors have not been finding it difficult to work online with patients,” said a faculty in GMCH. PGI had been trying to get PACS for a while and it shall be installed soon, said an official in the PGI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/gmch-to-get-software-to-upload-patient-data/articleshow/86100873.cms||Shimona Kanwar
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Strict rules to prevent illegal parking: Govt||Thiruvananthapuram: The Kerala state road transport corporation’s (KSRTC) new city circular services are poised to be launched in the city soon. As part of the initiative, a meeting headed by transport minister Antony Raju has decided to enforce rigorous regulations to prevent illegal parking. The new city circular is being introduced as part of strengthening the fleet of services where they were not previously available. In the initial phase the city circular services will run along seven routes. The color-coded buses will travel these routes in both clockwise and anti-clockwise throughout the day. After obtaining a pass, the public can take any number of rides on the circular bus routes. Because of the potential for traffic congestion caused by illegal parking, the meeting decided to take action against unlawful parking, particularly along the routes used by the circular services. In a choked region, two buses arriving at the same time might cause significant traffic congestion. Hence it was found that a far better solution will be to prevent parking of the vehicles in those congested areas. Officials from the traffic police department said in the meeting headed by the transport minister that such vehicles found parked in these routes and not in the specified parking areas would be towed away. The officials have promised that the multi-level car parking lot at Thiruvananthapuram Corporation’s main office premises in Palayam will be accessible to the public and it will also expand the parking facilities in the city. The meeting was attended by the officials from the corporation, police, public works department, and the road safety authority, as well as transport secretary Biju Prabhakar and Thiruvananthapuram sub collector M S Madhavikutty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/strict-rules-to-prevent-illegal-parking-govt/articleshow/86100877.cms||---

The application process for the third round ended on Thursday and the third merit list will be published on September 13 and the admissions will also be conducted between September 13 and 15. Shendkar said, “The decision to start classes is taken after it is observed that many colleges have filled up almost 90% of their seats and there can be an inordinate delay if we need to wait for the entire admission process to be over, before beginning the classes. Hence there is a chance that after the third round, it may be allowed for some colleges which have over 90-95% admissions completed.” Special rounds will be held next, followed by first-come-first-serve rounds. “Third round is the last regular round. The next two rounds will be what we call special rounds, even though they are also centralised admission rounds. We will see the response to these rounds and decide whether we need to conduct one more such rounds based on the number of applications, number of allotments and the vacancy. Once that ends, we will start with the first-come-first-serve (FCFS) round. A detailed schedule will be sent in time,” said Shendkar. Medha Sinnarkar, principal of Laxmanrao Apte Prashala said admissions to over 3/4th of her college’s available seats have been filled in the second round itself. “I think at the end of the third round, the vacancy in our grantable divisions will be in single digits. Students sometimes cancel their admissions after confirming it, but such numbers are few. We are ready to start with online classes as and when the state announces the schedule,” said Sinnarkar. At the end of the second round, there were 38,975 students who were able to secure admission to junior college while 73,950 seats remained vacant with 38,731 students in the centralised admission process without any admissions as of now.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/lectures-after-90-seats-fill-up-for-fyjc-after-sept-15/articleshow/86101504.cms||---

The incident took place at a crowded vaccination camp in Jaygha block of Jalaun on Thursday. Reports said two counters were set up to administer the vaccine to locals in Jaygha block. While people were waiting for their turn after the registration, one Bhagwati Devi, wife of Mahendra Singh, was given a dose of vaccine at the first counter. When she was about to leave, an employee asked her to collect her certificate/card from the second counter. When the old lady asked for the card from the employees who were vaccinating there, they said it will be given after administering the dose. Within minutes, a woman employee gave the second dose of the vaccine to the elderly. When she informed them that she had already taken a dose, chaos prevailed at the centre. Later, the condition of the old woman started deteriorating and the staff present there sent her to the nearby Community Health Centre. ND Sharma Chief Medical Officer, Jalaun, confirmed the woman was erroneously administered two doses of Covishield. District vaccination incharge Dr Sanjeev Prabhakar said that such negligence will not be tolerated and action will be taken after identifying the employees who were part of the team administering vaccine doses. He, however added, “The woman’s situation is normal and there is nothing to worry. The double dose is not likely to harm the person vaccinated because its job is to only increase immunity.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/70-year-old-jalaun-woman-administered-two-doses-of-covishied-within-minutes/articleshow/86101496.cms||---

Mayor Murlidhar Mohol, one of the trustees of the upcoming medical college, said, “The National Medical Commission’s panel, which recently visited the college for inspection of facilities and related matters, has given us a month’s time to ensure certain compliances. Once that is done, the name of the college will figure in the NEET’s option list of eligible colleges. The commission has given in-principle nod for admission by end of this year.” Asked about the Supreme Court ruling which mandates that all medical admissions be completed by September 30, a senior PMC official said, “The authorities are expecting some relaxation in the medical admission deadline this year considering the pandemic situation.” A total 48 professors have so far been appointed and the recruitment of more teaching staff is on. The PMC had declared the medical college project around five years back and has since completed the process of formation of a trust to run the college. “A preliminary assessment by the state authorities has been completed. The Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS) has cleared the proposal. The PMC had sent the proposal to the National Medical Commission in December last year for final approval. It has given an in-principle approval to the college. The committee again made a visit recently and suggested compliances,” the civic official said. “Once the final approval comes, we will be able to specify details about the seats for admission through NEET,” said a senior PMC official. The officials said that some key positions like administrative officer has been filled. Altogether 41 people, including some teaching staff, will be taken on deputation. Civic officials said that the college building is being constructed at the Naidu hospital. A makeshift arrangement has been made at Baburao Sanas school for conducting classes. The practical training will be given at Kamla Nehru hospital at Mangalwar peth.

The family members and locals flocked around Ram Bahadur as he got out of the vehicle. His mother Kusuma and father Gilla were the first to embrace him. His sister Rani, who arrived from her in-laws’ place, with a `Rakhi', is also very happy. "I have tied Rakhi to my brother exactly after 12 years. All these years I have been eagerly waiting for him," said Rani. "His return is nothing less than a Diwali or a Holi for us", she added According to police, Ram Bahadur, a native of Banda's Pachokhar village in Tindwari town, who was suffering some psychological disorder, had illegally crossed over to Pakistan and was arrested on suspicion that he was an Indian spy. He was released by the Pakistani authorities on August 30. After being handed over to Punjab authorities, he arrived at his native village Pachokhar on Thursday, said a senior district official. Naib tehsildar Baberu Abhinav Tiwari and sub inspector of Atarra police station Sudhir Chaurasia accompanied Ram Bahadur to his village. Speaking to the media, his family members thanked the officials and the government for bringing him back to India. His brother Maiku told reporters that after Ram Bahadur had gone missing in 2009, they lodged a complaint at the local police station. “A case was registered in this regard and efforts were also made to trace him. Later, my family came to know in January 2021 that Ram Bahadur had been detained in Pakistan, he said. "We searched for him, but couldn’t find him. We presumed that he might have died in some accident. We were shocked when we came to know that he reached Pakistan, and was imprisoned there," Maiku further said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/man-missing-since-2009-returns-village-in-banda-after-spending-12-year-in-jail-in-pakistan/articleshow/86101505.cms||Faiz Rahman Siddiqui

A student whose name has appeared in the merit list of a PG diploma programme said, “The entrance examination and results were declared promptly, but there was a delay getting started. The merit list of just a handful of courses was released but there was no communication about a majority of the courses. Finally, a few days ago, the list for the other courses was uploaded on the website. While the university notification said the admission will be activated on September 9, the link for my course came live on Friday. I hope there are no more delays now.” University officials had explained that some technical and administrative problems were the reason for a delay in declaring the merit list. “We have declared the merit list of almost all courses. Just one or two remain which will be declared soon. Students need not come to the university for admissions as everything is now online. They can complete the admission process including payment of fee online.

The suspect woman was arrested on the charge of kidnapping, after the baby’s mother lodged a complaint. Assistant inspector Savita Sapkale of the Bund Garden police said, “The complainant had taken her elder daughter to ward number 74 at the Sassoon hospital for treatment. She was waiting, along with her three-month-old younger daughter, while the hospital staffers were attending her elder daughter. Her neighbour, whose husband was also admitted in the same hospital, was sitting on an adjacent bench.” When called by the hospital staffers for some discussions, the baby’s mother requested her neighbour to look after the infant. “Soon, her neighbour was also called by the hospital staffers. The arrested woman, in a nurse’s uniform, told the complainant’s neighbour that she could leave the baby with her,” said Sapkale. When the complainant returned and met the neighbour after a while, they ran out of the hospital in search of the nurse. An autorickshaw driver told them that he had seen the “nurse” leaving in his friend’s autorickshaw.

---||Pune||Viral claims on dengue cure lack scientific basis: Experts||PUNE: A viral message claiming “coconut oil, along with black dates, juice of papaya leaves and kiwi fruit, cures dengue fever” had caught the imagination of a vast population few years back, skyrocketing their demand in many parts of the country. With the Covid-19 pandemic setting in early last year, the message almost died its natural death. But, the rise in dengue and chikungunya cases this year ensured that the viral message was back in circulation. When run by experts, it was found to be lacking scientific basis. In a report carried in TOI, Dr S Srinivas of Kempegowda Institute of Medical Sciences had said every fruit, and not just papaya, had antioxidants, which helped patients get better. “The juice of papaya leaves is not a proven remedy,” he had said. A medicine expert said, “No confirmatory test or clinical trial has proven that papaya leaves can effectively treat dengue. Ditto goes with kiwi fruit and coconut oil.” On the use of black dates, a health expert confirmed that ‘khajur’ were packed with nutrition, but whether they could cure one of dengue fever was a matter of research. “Aedes aegypti causes dengue and chikungunya. The accumulated water acts as breeding ground for these mosquitoes. Cleaning ones house is the first and the most basic step to stop dengue spread. People should not forget to clean pots or container where water is likely to collect, especially during the monsoon,” the expert said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/viral-claims-on-dengue-cure-lack-scientific-basis-experts/articleshow/86101510.cms||---

MahaRERA chief Ajoy Mehta told TOI that in the coming week they would evaluate the status of the projects declared lapsed. “The authority will hold a meeting next week to work out a strategy to resolve the issue of lapsed projects.” Ramesh Prabhu, chairman, Maharashtra Society Welfare Assocation (MSWA), said that in the case of lapsed projects if additional time has to be granted under section 7(3) of the RERA by the authority, the promoter needs to register the cooperative housing society or facilitate registration of association of allottees. Meanwhile, state CREDAI president Sunil Furde said that the way forward for the lapsed projects is to ensure that the projects are completed seeking permission from 51% allottees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/timeline-needed-for-projects-with-51-consent-activists/articleshow/86101523.cms||Nisha Nambiar
---||Pune||10-day Ganeshotsav commences amid Covid restrictions in Pune||PUNE: People in the city celebrated Ganesh Chaturthi on Friday with less pomp and more vigour amidst the Covid-19 restrictions. The skies darkened and opened up occasionally, but that could hardly stymie the enthusiasm among the people who wore new clothes, participated in the aarti and partook of traditional delicacies with gusto. “We are trying to observe the festive season the best we can, given the situations right now. We do observe Ganeshotsav at home by bringing Ganpati to our home for ten days, but we as a family also love to go out and visit the large pandals, wade through the crowds, and soak in the festivities, and it is sad to miss it for two years in a row. Hopefully, it will change for the better in 2022,” said Ashok Sharma, a Vimannagar resident. The large Ganeshotsav mandals, as per official order, marked the beginning of festivities at their permanent temples, with no large pandals or Ganesh idols and not too many people by the way of guests. Most of the well-known temples that are run by the mandals had sizeable security personnel, who prevented devotees from lingering too long. The cynosure of all eyes during the Ganeshotsav, the Dagdusheth Halwai Ganpati, marked the day with a low-key ceremony, with its president Ashok Godse being the only guests present at the pratisthapan ceremony on Friday morning. People celebrating the festival at home mostly opted for a wide variety of eco-friendly Ganesh idols, simple earthen or paper-mache structures, or those made of chocolate and food grain. “We have sold a number of eco-friendly Ganesh idols which come with seeds or saplings, which people can plant in the soil after the home immersion,” said Appa Dhole.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/10-day-ganeshotsav-commences-amid-covid-restrictions-in-city/articleshow/86101532.cms||---
---||Nagpur||SRPF commandant Harssh Poddar’s Covid management model gets world recognition||NAGPUR: Harssh Poddar, an IPS officer of 2013 batch, is an Oxford-educated corporate lawyer-turned-cop whose Covid management model as a commanding officer of the state reserve police force (SRPF) has got published in the prestigious US-based academic journal on international relationships ‘The Fletcher forum of world affairs’. Poddar, commandant of Group IX of SRPF at Amravati, had ensured zero fatality in the second wave with around 135 personnel of his unit testing positive. Though Amravati remained in the national news for being the land where the Delta variant of Covid was first traced before it turned into a hotbed of the raging infection in Vidarbha with a high number of deaths, Poddar ensured that Covid did not take a fatal turn for the 1,100 SRPF personnel and their 3,500 family members. Poddar, who had earlier worked as zonal DCP in Nagpur, ensured 100 percent first dose and almost 99% second dose vaccinations with more than 10 camps and repeated awareness campaigns. In the second wave, the challenge was not just prevention but also treatment of those infected. “We were struck by the sudden spike in cases. When we learnt about the high mortality rate everywhere, we decided to rapidly execute scientific methods of prevention and treatment. This was all the more important because SRPF was going to be deployed for election and anti-Naxal assignments, thereby increasing the exposure of personnel,” he said. A former Chevening scholar, Poddar said the health infrastructure was so taxed that it was not possible to expect doctors to individual attention to every case. “As the commanding officer of the battalion, it was my duty to monitor each case personally along with my team,” said Poddar whose Covid management measures as SP Beed was also published as a case study by the ministry of home affairs (MHA) and also in a journal by Columbia University. Poddar had devised a unique ‘three tier’ model of quarantine. First tier (also Level 1 of the quarantine) accommodated SRPF personnel returning after external deployment for five days before testing. In level 2, personnel testing positive would be shifted to institutional quarantine centres. A level 3 quarantine system was created for three days before testing for the family members or others with whom the positive personnel had come in contact with. Poddar had also tied up with local diagnostic centres and also prepared a standard operating procedure (SOP) of testing. A strict monitoring regime was also instituted. “I detailed discussions with doctors who were into critical Covid care. On the basis of these discussions, I developed a standard operating procedure of conducting diagnostic tests on specific days of the disease,” said Poddar. “This provided us with timely indicators if someone was going to take a turn for the worse because Covid patients often turn critical suddenly,” he said. It’s learnt that Poddar had emphasized on testing for markers predictive of the onset of cytokine storm and need for mechanical ventilation along with those to detect pulmonary infection, liver and kidney functions and others like blood coagulation which generally indicate deterioration. “Preparedness and strategic planning is crucial for any risk management and emergencies. We had procured oxygen concentrators in March much before the stock got over in the market,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/srpf-commandant-poddars-covid-management-model-gets-world-recognition/articleshow/86100922.cms||Soumitra Bose
---||Kolkata||West Bengal ex-CM’s kin found living on footpath, shifted to mental hospital||KOLKATA: Ira Basu — the 70-year-old sister of former Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee’s wife Mira — who has been living on pavements on the northern fringes of the city, was shifted to a city mental hospital by Barrackpore police on Friday. Basu, a retired school teacher, has been homeless for several years ever since, she alleged, she was driven out of the house of an ex-headmistress of the school, where she lived after the former’s death. Ira retired from a government school in 2009 and is entitled to a monthly pension, which she hasn’t yet claimed. TOI called the landlines at Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee’s residence but the calls went unanswered. The matter came to light after a bunch of her students felicitated Basu on a pavement under the Dunlop flyover on Teacher’s Day on September 5. After the images went viral on social media, many came forward to help her but she refused assistance, saying she did not need money and had enough to sustain. According to locals in the Dunlop area, Ira never begged or accepted money but lived on pavements across the Baranagar and Dunlop area. She would make it a point to buy food from local eateries and never accepted alms. According to teachers of the Khardah Priyanath Girls’ High School, where she taught, Ira had been a sincere teacher. But for the last couple of years of her job, “she would often come to school barefoot, wear dirty clothes and look unkempt. She started living with a former headmistress at the latter’s house after her retirement. But a few years later, after the headmistress’ death, she moved to a pavement in Baranagar and has been living on the road ever since,” said a former colleague. She added that though Ira is entitled to a pension she hasn’t claimed it. But the former headmistress with whom she lived, helped her get the provident fund dues. Krishnakali Chandra, the present headmistress, added that though Ira is entitled to a pension she hasn’t claimed it. On Friday, the Barrackpore district inspector of schools asked Chandra to hand over Basu’s papers to process her pension payment. Mental health activist and clinic psychologist Ratnaboli Ray said: “She has been living on the pavement with dignity for years. She has been carrying out bank transactions. Then why was she picked up? This completely violates the Mental Healthcare Act.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/buddha-in-law-goes-from-pavement-to-mental-hosp/articleshow/86101534.cms||Sanjib Chakrabarty
---||Thiruvananthapuram||Gangster dies while out of jail on parole||Thiruvananthapuram: Notorious gangster Karate Farooq, who was serving life sentence for murdering his rival outside the special sub jail at Attakkulangara 22 years ago, has died of suspected heart ailment here in the city. He was 52 years old. The police said that Farooq, who was on parole, died around 2 am on Friday at his residence at Beemapally. A local trial court had sentenced him for capital punishment for the murder of LTTE Kabir, another notorious gangster. Kabir was an undertrial prisoner when he was killed in 1999. He was being taken to the sub jail from court when Farooq and gang hurled crude bombs at him. Farooq was given death sentence by the court. However, the Supreme Court later turned the capital punishment into life sentence. After serving a few years in Poojapura central jail here he was transferred to Viyyur central jail. Over a year ago he was granted parole citing medical reasons, but on condition that he was not allowed to enter the capital district. However, this condition was relaxed following the Covid 19 pandemic.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/gangster-dies-while-out-of-jail-on-parole/articleshow/86100936.cms||---

In fact, the number had come down to 99 on Thursday. The last time Delhi had 100 containment zones was more than a year ago on May 28, 2020. The number of red zones has more than halved in the last 20 days as there were 234 such areas on August 20. Less than four months ago, the number of containment zones stood at a staggering 57,800. Currently, two out of the 11 revenue districts have zero containment zones. Out of the 100 zones at present, the number of active zones is 75 and 25 are in the process of being scaled down. As the capital witnessed an exponential growth of cases during the second Covid-19 wave in April and May, it was during mid-May that the number of containment zones skyrocketed and reached the peak of 57,800 on May 18. The number fell drastically to 500 in mid-July and dipped below the 250-mark on August 20, out of which active zones were 158 and 76 were being scaled down. While New Delhi district had the highest number of red zones at 176 at July end, by the end of August, too, it had the highest number of containment zones at 115. The number, however, has reduced drastically to 12, out of which nine are active zones. South district has the highest number of containment zones at present at 27, compared with 29 it had 20 days ago. West district has the second highest number of containment zones at 14, down from 22 on August 20. Shahdara, which also has 14 containment zones currently, had only eight zones on the same date. These districts are followed by North West (13), New Delhi (12) and North (10). In the remaining districts, the number of containment zones is in single digits. Central and North East districts have zero containment zones. The decline in the number of containment zones and active cases has led to higher contact tracing and surveillance. An official said with the number of red zones being very low in most districts, a stringent watch was being kept not only inside the zones, but also in the buffer areas.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/at-100-number-of-sealed-zones-dips-to-the-lowest-since-may-last-year/articleshow/86101549.cms||Sidharatha Roy
---||Pune||Parts of Maharashtra to get heavy rain from Sunday, says IMD; 6 districts put on ‘orange alert’||PUNE: The next few days of Ganeshotsav are expected to be wet with the monsoon set to gather pace again. At least six districts in Maharashtra have been put on an orange alert for September 13-14 with chances of isolated heavy to very heavy rain in these regions, including Pune district’s ghat areas, India Meteorological Department (IMD) officials told TOI on Friday. There is a possibility of isolated heavy rain in various parts of Maharashtra during the next few days, with the intensity increasing further from Sunday evening for a couple of days. The alert has come against the backdrop of a fairly strong low pressure system likely to develop over the central Bay of Bengal by Saturday morning. It is is very likely to strengthen and may concentrate into a depression over northwest and adjoining westcentral Bay of Bengal during the subsequent 48 hours with likely west-north west movement. Districts on a heavy rain alert during the next few days include the ghats of Pune, Kolhapur, Satara, Palghar, Thane, Mumbai, among others. Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather forecasting division of IMD Pune, said, “The heavy to very heavy rain forecast for isolated parts of Maharashtra has been issued with likely formation of the low pressure area and its west-northwestward movement and further intensification, as well as the simultaneous strengthening of lower level westerlies along the west coast.” Kashyapi said that models so far are predicting the formation of the low pressure area in the next 12 hours. Already, huge masses of clouds can be seen over central Bay of Bengal, indicating the formation of the system. As per model consensus, there is 75% probability of its formation into a low pressure area, he added. Since the system’s movement will be west northwestwards, central and northern parts of Maharashtra are likely to see an increase in rain activity, including heavy to very heavy rain in isolated parts in the ghats of Pune, Kolhapur and Satara districts on September 13-14, in addition to increased rainfall activity over Konkan during the period, Kashyapi said. Rainfall activity is likely to increase from Sunday evening. For Pune city, IMD has forecast light rain for the next few days, but officials said weather models and other parameters will have to be observed critically for a couple of days to gauge the actual rain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/imd-forecasts-heavy-rain-in-parts-of-maha-from-sunday/articleshow/86101527.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Delhi||1,000-mm mark breached, 11-year rain record may fall in Delhi||NEW DELHI: Despite monsoon arriving late this year, Safdarjung, Delhi’s base station for weather, crossed the 1,000mm rainfall mark for the season on Friday. The Safdarjung observatory received 5.4mm of rainfall in a 24-hour period till 8.30 am on Friday, with 10.2mm of rainfall recorded between 5.30 pm and 8.30 pm, taking the figure to 1,015.5mm. It went past the 1,000mm mark for the first time since 2010, when Delhi received 1,031.5mm between June and September. With rains forecast for the weekend, Delhi could easily beat that record even before the month is over, Met officials said. India Meteorological Department has issued an ‘orange’ alert for Saturday, forecasting moderate to heavy showers that could result in waterlogging across the city once again. The ‘normal’ mark for rainfall between June 1 and September 10 is 586.4mm. For the complete monsoon season of June till September, the normal mark is 648.9mm. Delhi has received 1,215.9mm of annual rainfall so far, as opposed to an annual normal of 779mm from January until December. “Delhi received a large chunk of its rainfall (500 mm) in July. August was in deficit but still recorded over 200mm and the first two days of September alone recorded over 200mm of rainfall,” said an official. On Friday, Delhi received ‘trace’ rainfall between 8.30 am and 5.30 pm at Safdarjung. Between 5.30 pm and 8.30 pm, 10.2mm rainfall was recorded. IMD says the 2010 record could be crossed on Saturday itself, with a good chance of moderate to heavy showers occurring across the capital. “We can expect moderate to heavy rainfall on Saturday and moderate showers on Sunday. A number of records will be broken in September,” said the official. In comparison, during the monsoon season, the capital had received 576.5mm rainfall in 2020, 404.3mm in 2019 and 762.6mm in 2018. In 2013, it received 876mm of rainfall between June and September. Safdarjung has so far received six ‘heavy’ rainfall days – when over 64.5mm of rainfall was recorded in a 24-hour duration. Two such days came on the first two days of September, when Delhi recorded 112.1mm on September 1 and 117.7mm on September 2. It has so far received 248.9 mm precipitation this month – almost double the September average mark of 129.8mm. Delhi’s air quality, meanwhile, remained in the ‘satisfactory’ category with an overall Air Quality Index of 79, according to the Central Pollution Control Board.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/1000-mm-mark-breached-11-year-rain-record-may-fall/articleshow/86102133.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

According to a report from the district health office, around 6.46 lakh beneficiaries were now eligible for the second dose of Covishield, around 92,406 for Covaxin and 4,579 for Sputnik V. The cantonment areas, along with the Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad civic bodies, have 5.05 lakh beneficiaries due for their second dose of the designated vaccines. The number of beneficiaries due for their second dose would increase by mid-September because the district had recorded a total vaccination of around 17 lakh in July. Most of the beneficiaries had got their first jabs then. Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, told TOI, “We shall be targeting the completion of the second dose of the beneficiaries at the earliest as we are receiving a good supply of vaccines. Instructions have been sent to reserve 70% doses for the second dose and 30% for the first.” Sanjay Patil, the chairman of the Indian Medical Association (IMA)’s Hospital Board of India, said the health department should set the target of over 20-lakh vaccination per month to keep the balance between the first dose and the second dose beneficiaries. “The district is struggling with the consistency of the vaccine availability. If the administration can address the vaccine availability, the remaining eligible population of the district could be covered at the earliest,” he said. Around 64.06 lakh beneficiaries received their first shots in the district, while 25.19 lakh got both the doses till September 10.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/over-7-lakh-eligible-for-2nd-vaccine-shot-in-district-now/articleshow/86101560.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Lucknow||UP polls: Mayawati dumps Mukhtar Ansari, says no ticket to ‘bahubalis’||LUCKNOW: In a politically significant move, BSP chief Mayawarti on Friday announced denying party ticket to gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari in the forthcoming UP polls. Mukhtar, at present lodged in Banda jail, is a sitting BSP MLA from Mau assembly constituency, the seat which he has been representing since 1996. The development comes almost two weeks after Mukhtar's brother Sibgatullah Ansari joined the Samajwadi Party, in what relayed sharp signals about the Ansari family moving away from the BSP camp. In place of Mukhtar, Mayawati has decided to field party state president Bhim Rajbhar, indicating a deft strategy to consolidate the Rajbhar community, which accounts for a sizable chunk of the voting population in the east UP region. The BSP chief categorically said that her party has decided not to field 'bahubalis' or a `mafia don' and that the zonal coordinators have been asked to closely verify the credentials of the candidates before picking them. This, she said, is being done so that action could be taken against “such people” (having criminal antecedents) when she comes to power after the 2022 assembly elections. Mayawati said that her party vowed to establish the "rule of law" while abiding by the motto of 'Sarvajan Hitay Sarvajan Sukhay' (welfare of everyone). Her decision to deny tickets to candidates with criminal background comes close on the heels of her party stance to woo the Brahmin community as part of a tried and tested social engineering formula that catapulted her to full majority for the first time in 2007 UP assembly elections. Experts said that the upper caste had then voted in favour of BSP in 2007. The BSP chief's hard stance against Mukhtar comes two days after All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi inducted the family of dreaded don Atiq Ahmad, invoking sharp response from various political quarters. Owaisi had categorically slammed that notion of calling people from one particular community as `bahubalis' while steering clear that his party stood for the welfare of Muslim community which has been receiving a harsh deal in the incumbent BJP dispensation. It was only two years ago that Mukhtar's brother Afzal Ansari won the Lok Sabha election from Ghazipur seat after Mayawati cobbled up an alliance with the Akhilesh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party. In fact, Mayawati won 10 seats in comparison to five won by the Samajwadi Party. With BSP boss calling off an alliance with the SP, Akhilesh has been seeking to position his party as the main opposition to the ruling BJP in the run-up to the high stake UP elections. Mayawati had inducted Mukhtar and his family just before the 2017 UP assembly elections. This was soon after Akhilesh hardened his stand against Mukhtar and his Quami Ekta Dal (QED), which had been merged with the ruling SP. Akhilesh's opposition led to the demerger and then Mayawati whipped up the minority card by giving nearly 100 seats to the Muslim candidates amid a strife in the family of SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav. The Ansari family is believed to wield considerable influence in at least half a dozen districts in east UP. Her decision, however, fell flat as except for Mukhtar, none of the members from the Ansari family could register a win. While Sibgatullah lost to saffron party candidate Alka Rai, widow of slain BJP leader Krishnand Rai, from Mohammadabad constituency in Ghazipur, Mukhtar's son, Abbas Ansari, a national-level shooter, lost to Phagu Chauhan in Ghosi. Chauhan, an OBC (Nonia) is at present governor of Bihar. AIMIM willing to field Mukhtar Ansari from MauHours after Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) supremo Mayawati announced that her party won't field sitting MLA Mukhtar Ansari from Mau in the 2022 polls, All India Ittehadul Muslameen's (AIMIM's) Uttar Pradesh unit announced that it would welcome the jailed gangster if he wanted to join them and also give him ticket to contest from Mau. AIMIM's state president Shauquat Ali told TOI that if the law of the land allowed Mukhtar Ansari to contest elections, then AIMIM is more than ready to welcome him into the party-fold. "We will field him as an AIMIM candidate from Mau. Not only this, if he wants to contest as an independent candidate, AIMIM will extend full support to him," Shauquat Ali said. AIMIM's announcement comes days after the party's national president Asaduddin Owaisi inducted jailed gangster and former MP Atiq Ahmed and his family members into the party fold at a function in Lucknow.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/mayawati-dumps-mukhtar-says-no-ticket-to-bahubalis/articleshow/86102139.cms||Pankaj Shah
---||Amritsar||Punjab: Gurdwara polls director Narinder Singh, DSGMC Akali Dal members lock horns||AMRITSAR/JALANDHAR: The gurdwara elections director and Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) members aligned to the SAD are at loggerheads with both filing police complaints against each other. While gurdwara elections director Narinder Singh has accused a few SAD(B) members of manhandling him and hurling a shoe at him, DSGMC member Atma Singh Lubana has accused him of offering bribe. Narinder has alleged that while three DSGMC members assaulted him, DSGMC general secretary Harmeet Singh Kalka threatened him. “SAD(B) members of DSGMC not only tried to stop me from discharging my duties but also misbehaved and manhandled me,” he told TOI on Friday. A 49-second video has surfaced, showing the gurdwara polls director walking towards his car amid police security and a man wearing a saffron turban trying to hurl a shoe at him as he is about to enter the vehicle. Narinder said he had lodged a complaint at police station IP Estate, Delhi, seeking action against the person who attacked him and also sought security for himself and his family members. The poll director said he had convened a meeting of all the 46 elected members of DSGMC on Thursday for the cooption of nine members. After the voting and counting for coopted members representing Sikh personalities of Delhi, when draw of lots for co-opting two members of gurdwaras of registered Singh Sabha began, he asked for any objections as per the rules. He said there were several verbal as well as written objections and the situation turned volatile, with one faction wanting him to go ahead with list (of Singh Sabha gurdwaras) and the other demanding verification (of list) from respective sub divisional magistrates. “The tempers rose so high that any decision would have resulted in bitter resentment among either of them, so I decided to adjourn the meeting. Soon after several members left the office but the SAD(B) members stayed back and pressurised me to complete the process on the same day,” he alleged and claimed that he could escape only because of his presence of mind and timely intervention by Delhi Police. “This is not the first time that I have been at the receiving end of their unprovoked ire and unwarranted threats. Earlier also I had written to higher authorities regarding threats to my life by (DSGMC president) Manjinder Singh Sirsa during press conferences and national media interview. A copy of the application and clippings of the video threats can be provided as and when asked for,” the FIR reads. While condemning the violence against the gurdwara elections director, Jago party president Manjit Singh GK demanded stern action against persons causing ruckus during the co-option process. A Delhibased political analyst and expert on DSGMC elections, Inder Mohan Singh said that such unlawful acts of the representatives of a religious body had bowed down the heads of the Sikh community in shame. Any objection against the decision of director could have been legally sorted out, he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/gurdwara-polls-director-dsgmcs-sad-members-lock-horns/articleshow/86101557.cms||Yudhvir Rana
---||Pune||Forest team traps leopard at Vadgaon Patole village||Pune: A team from the Khed range forest office on Thursday trapped a fully-grown male leopard, which is suspected to have killed a 60-year-old woman, Janabai Gadade, at Vadgaon Patole village in Khed tehsil. The forest department had set up five trap cages in the village to catch the animal. Range forest officer Pradeep Raundhal said, “Although we are yet to get a report from the laboratory to confirm that the woman was killed by a leopard, veterinary doctors and experts, who conducted a preliminary inspection of the body, have opined that the woman was killed by a leopard. The trapped leopard is at the Manikdoh rescue centre. The staff there will monitor his behaviour for the next few weeks.” “The DNA sample of the victim and the samples of the animal will be tested to ascertain the attack. The movement of the animal is slow. Animals, which are old, often struggle to hunt prey and prefer easy targets. This could be one of the reasons behind the killing of the woman,” Raundhal added. The animal caught after nearly a week after the attack, bringing relief to terrified villagers who had restricted their movements following the death of the woman, said forest officials. Deputy sarpanch Amar Patole said, “The catching of the animal was necessary as many villagers could not work in farms fearing another attack by the animal. The sighting of the leopard in and around the village is frequent. The forest department should increase day and night patrolling in the area.” Jayram Gowda, deputy conservator of forest, Junnar division, said the department plans to focus mainly on awareness programmes. “Various awareness campaigns will be launched in villages. This would help many to take precautions while working in farms, especially at night,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/forest-team-traps-leopard-at-vadgaon-patole-village/articleshow/86101559.cms||---

The supply has been coming in a large quantity from Pune and neighboring districts over the last two days in anticipation of good rates on the first day of Ganeshotsav, said an APMC official at the Market Yard. Marigold is being sold in the Rs20-40 range for 1kg. Similarly, 1kg aster flowers are being sold for Rs8-12. A bunch of roses are being auctioned for Rs20-30. One bunch of gerbera was sold in the Rs30-50 range in the market, an official said. Raju Potale, commission agent of flowers at the Market Yard, said, “During the Ganesh festival, 1kg mogra usually sells for over Rs1,500. But this year, it is being sold in the Rs400-500 range. We observed similar trends in the rates of other flowers as well.” This year, the overall rainfall has been inconsistent. “As a result, many flower farmers were able to keep their plantations well. But there is not enough demand in the market because of the subdued Ganesh festival,” the official said. “As many flowers were costly last year, this year the farmers cultivated flowers on large areas. This also contributed to a large suppply. Ultimately all rates have dropped,” said Madhulkant Garad, chief administrator of the Market Yard. Rates of flowers in the retail markets and around the temples were costly, customers said. Similar sentiments were echoed by residents of Kothrud, Deccan, Aundh, Baner, and other areas. “For the next ten days, they will sell flowers at a high cost irrespective of the rates in the wholesale market,” said Vaishali Ranade, a Kothrud resident.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/glut-in-supply-reduces-wholesale-flower-rates/articleshow/86101542.cms||---

---||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh: Yogi Adityanath gave Rs 1,129 crore from CM fund to over 71,000 poor people for treatment||LUCKNOW: He may have the image of a firebrand leader, but Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has revealed his softer self by going way ahead of his predecessors in extending support to the poor and the distressed through the CM’s discretionary fund. In the past four-and-a-half years, Yogi has disbursed Rs 1,129 crore through the fund to 71,626 people for treatment. The figures are more than double of what SP president Akhilesh Yadav gave away during his five-year tenure as the UP CM and almost 13 times more than Rs 84 crore released by Mayawati during her term (2007-12). In the past five months (April 1-August 31), during and after the second wave of coronavirus pandemic, around Rs 121 crore was provided as financial assistance to 6,618 beneficiaries. Officials claimed that UP, with a population of around 24 crore, has fared better in tackling the pandemic as compared to any other state. Saving lives and livelihood were the top priorities of the Yogi Adityanath government, they added. In April, Rs 13.26 crore was provided to around 781 people while in May, this went up to nearly Rs 17.20 crore which was disbursed to over 943 people. In June this year, the government provided Rs 24.85 crore to 1,376 beneficiaries followed by Rs 29.33 crore to 1,497 people in July 2021. Similarly, Rs 36.44 crore was provided to 2,021 people in August. According to the details released by the CM’s office regarding the funds, the BJP government has till now extended the help of over Rs 1,100 crore to poor patients. The Samajwadi Party government under Akhilesh Yadav had provided Rs 552 crore to 42,508 people while the Mayawati government gave only Rs 84 crore to around 18,462 people. Officials in the Chief Minister’s office said after coming to power, CM Yogi Adityanath had issued directives that help should be provided to people who had given up hope for treatment for the want of money. The government not only saved the lives of thousands of people but also ensured that they did not have to sell their land and property to meet medical expenses. The year wise breakup shows the consistency with which the government provided help to the people. The CM helped 13,228 people with Rs 184.63 crore in 2017-18 through discretionary fund. In 2018-19, over 17,772 people were given over Rs 256.34 crore, while in 2019-20, about 18,014 people received Rs 280.23 crore. Around Rs 132.55 crore was provided to 7,269 people in 2020-21. Help was provided for kidney transplants and patients suffering from cancer, heart ailments and other serious diseases. Officials said the maximum money was given to patients for the treatment of cancer, kidney and heart disease.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/yogi-gave-rs-1129cr-from-cm-fund-to-over-71k-poor-people-for-treatment/articleshow/86102148.cms||Rajiv Srivastava

---||Chandigarh||PSERC dismisses PSPCL review plea on approval to PPAs of 5 power plants||Patiala: Reinstating its earlier decision, the Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC) has dismissed the review petition of PSPCL and denied approval to the running power purchase agreements (PPAs) with five generating stations by terming them economically unviable due to high cost of power. The commission had disallowed the procurement of power from DVC generating stations (Durgapur, Raghunathpur and Bokaro), Pragati Gas Power Station (Bawana) and Meja Urja Nigam Private Limited (MUNPL), aggregating to 885.10 MW, on grounds of high cost of power being purchased from these stations despite much cheaper power available in the market. The commission said it had already given Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) the liberty to renegotiate viable rates for power plants, including MUNPL, and seek the commission’s approval. In February this year, PSERC disallowed power procurement from these stations, but three months later PSPCL filed a petition with the PSERC to review its orders submitting that the power from these stations was being scheduled on a month-to-month basis and even during non-paddy season and the average power scheduled during 2018-19 and 2019-20 from DVC Durgapur, Raghunathpur and Bokaro was 83.4%, 86.4% and 94.2%, respectively, of the availability declared by DVC. The PPA with Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC), Kolkata, was signed in 2006 and the state power corporation started scheduling power from Durgapur, Raghunathpur and Bokaro thermal stations from 2012, 2016 and 2018, respectively. PSERC observed that power from these stations was procured from Rs 4.39 to Rs 5.53 per unit. It said, “The commission has approved the PPA in respect of power stations having total per unit rate (fixed + variable) less than Rs 3, which shall be beneficial for substitution of power of existing stations or vintage stations having variable cost of Rs 3 or more.” The commission noticed that PSPCL surrendered 8,571 million units (MUs) and 15,546 MUs during 2018-19 and 2019-20, respectively, from thermal and gas power stations. The PPA between Pragati Power Corporation Limited (PPCL), Himadri, and PSPCL was signed in 2008 and power had been supplied since December 2011, whereas the PPA between MUNPL, Allahabad, and PSPCL was executed in December 2010. Private generators submitted before the commission that there was no need for approval of PPA as power purchase had already gone through a regulatory process and the cost was reflected and approved by PSERC in the aggregated revenue report (ARR). On this, the commission asserted that provisional approval of projections for the procurement of power in the annual tariff orders for the distribution utility cannot be construed to be an approval of the PPA and, at most, it can be attributed as approval of projections of cost and quantity of purchase of power for that one year. PSPCL director (generation) Paramjeet Singh said, “I am yet to go through the orders thoroughly and would act accordingly.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/pserc-dismisses-pspcl-review-plea-on-approval-to-ppas-of-5-power-plants/articleshow/86101564.cms||Bharat Khanna

While one was arrested for growing a ganja plant in his house premises, the other was arrested for possessing ganja that was meant for sale. Both arrests were made in Perumbazhuthoor region. The officials identified the accused arrested for growing a ganja plant as Arun Kumar, 30, of Arun Nivas at Perumbazhuthoor. The officials have also seized a 252 cm tall ganja plant that was growing near the car porch of his house. Range inspector S S Sachin said the accused was an addict who lived alone following the death of his parents. His friends used to regularly visit his house to smoke ganja. The neighbours who grew suspicious over the activities at the residence alerted the excise officials, which led to a raid and the subsequent arrest. The one who was caught with 1.200 grams of ganja was identified as Britto Lal, 35, of Keeliyode. He was caught while transporting the ganja on his motorcycle by the excise officials conducting vehicle inspection at Perumpazhuthoor on Thursday evening.

In six months, the number of such plants has gone up to 400,” an official statement said, adding, “12 units got functional in the past four days.” Officials said the oxygen plants have been set up with the joint effort of the state health and medical education department. Several units have been mobilised by the state industries and excise departments through the corporate social responsibility allocations. Funds from the PM Cares have also been provided. “Another 155 medical oxygen projects are in the pipeline,” they said. Officials said the oxygen plants have come up under state’s plan to become self-reliant in oxygen supply before the anticipated third Covid wave. “CM Yogi Adityanath had directed officials to work in mission mode so that there is minimum loss of life in case the third Covid wave turns out to be as dangerous as the second one,” they said. CM reviews the progress of the project daily. On Friday, he told the officials to expedite the work of the remaining 155 oxygen plants. The departments concerned have undertaken a real-time monitoring of the installation work, with the district administrations being asked to continuously monitor the progress of installation work and ensure availability of raw material for timely completion of the plants. Officials said to ensure that there is no shortage of workforce to run and maintain the medical oxygen plants, training of paramedical staff and pharmacists at the local level is also underway. In addition to this, to strengthen Covid Control Management and to connect youth with employment, around 372 government ITI trainees in Uttar Pradesh will be engaged in operation of the oxygen plants.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/375-o2-plants-in-6-mths-no-up-from-25-to-400-in-state/articleshow/86102160.cms||Shailvee Sharda
---||Kochi||LDF to move no-trust motion against municipality chief||Kochi: The LDF-led opposition councillors in Thrikkakara approached the regional joint director (RJD) of local self-government department (LSGD) on Friday and submitted a request for moving a no-confidence motion against UDF chairperson Ajitha Thankappan. The move followed the pandemonium witnessed in the council over alleged payment of Rs 10,000 each to councillors as an Onam gift. The notice, signed by 18 opposition councillors, stated that Thankappan was nepotistic, autocrat and corrupt and they have lost confidence in her rule. As per rules, RJD will call councillors for discussion and voting within 15 days of receiving the notice. If 22 councillors vote against the chairperson, she would lose the chairperson’s post. Currently, LDF has support of only 18 councillors against 25 councillors of the UDF. The ruling party has support of four independents. While LDF pins hopes on independents who currently support the ruling front and discontented Congress councillors, UDF tries to retain the local body by unifying the aggrieved councillors. The ripple effect of LDF moving no-confidence motion against Thankappan has reached UDF camp too with some councillors seeking Congress leaders in the district to intervene in the issue immediately. The meeting of Congress mandalam committee in Thrikkakara will be held on Saturday evening to discuss the issue. Meeting of UDF parliamentary committee in Thrikkakara will be held later. “The stand of independents is crucial as no party has majority in the local body. We have not held any discussion with them so far. It will be held soon. Besides, there are disgruntled Congress councillors in the UDF camp. Some of them may support LDF while moving the no-confidence motion,” said an opposition councillor. A UDF councillor admitted that there was rift in Congress in Thrikkakara. “No meeting of UDF was held in Thrikkakara so far. With the LDF moving no-confidence motion, UDF will discuss the matter. Some Congress councillors want to replace Thankappan. She belongs to the ‘I’ group. We hope that the rift in Congress will be sorted out through discussion,” he said. Meanwhile, change at the helm of Congress in the state also reflected in the lower strata of the party in Thrikkakara with some councillors in both ‘A’ and ‘I’ groups switching allegiance against each other. The district Congress leaders said they won’t bow to the demand of some councillors to replace Thankappan with any other councillor. “The issue in Thrikkakara is on some minor topics like photo of some councillors has not appeared in posters. LDF has raised corruption allegation against UDF as a reason for the no-confidence motion. Actually, they have done major corruption during their tenure,” said a senior leader in Ernakulam DCC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/ldf-to-move-no-trust-motion-against-municipality-chief/articleshow/86100161.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

They would procure ganja from other states, like Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, in wholesale and smuggle it to Ludhiana in 28kg salt sacks. To deceive the authorities and ensure smooth transport till Ludhiana, the gang would make 8kg packets of ganja and stuff those inside the sacks by removing equal quantities of salt and repack them. Then they would transport these sacks to their godown in Neechi Mangli in Ludhiana, from where they sold it within their network.Sources said the areas with high migrant population were the major hubs for the sale of the contraband and the accused had made chains of dealers who procured ganja from them and then made small pouches of it as per demand of the end customers. The DRI authorities were able to reach the main accused of the nexus after putting the retailers and dealers under surveillance.Small samples have been drawn from the 52 packets of ganja seized by the DRI so as to establish its grade and value. The accused who have been arrested and remanded to judicial custody till September 23 are Shivam of 33 Foota Road, Mundia Kalan, Mintu of Ramnagar Bhamia Kalan, Arvinder Singh Sidhu of Sunetwali Kitchlu Nagar, Manoj of Kali Sadak, Jain Colony, Ranjit Rai of Gareeb Nagar, Kanaganwal, Bidesh Rai of Bihar but now living at Gareeb Nagar, Kanganwal.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/400kg-ganja-seizure-accused-smuggled-drug-in-salt-sacks/articleshow/86100952.cms||Mohit Behl

Eloor is the only municipality in the district that has won the award. In panchayat level, Chottanikkara bagged the award. With a population of nearly 50,000 people, Eloor municipality has won the award through active participation of residents, green task force members and students. “Though we have won the award by securing the mark needed for it, the local body is yet to achieve 100% in waste management. We had conducted awareness among students in the pre-pandemic period and with Kudumbashree workers to spread awareness against littering waste. Students had conducted flash mobs at public places and held contests among them itself to inculcate a culture on proper waste management,” said Eloor municipality chairman A D Sujil. The local body had set up six major biocompost bins at different places. Green task force members collect non-biodegradable waste from houses in each division based on calendar date.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/award-for-eloor-municipality/articleshow/86100163.cms||---
---||Lucknow||UP govt plans one-time settlement scheme for power consumers||LUCKNOW: In what could turn out to be one of the biggest election sops, the Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Ltd is drafting a proposal for a one-time settlement (OTS) scheme for consumers in rural as well as urban areas. If all goes as per plan, the scheme will be launched by September-end. The scheme is also likely to cover farmers who have tubewells in the 5 KVA load category. The proposal is being drafted on the directives of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, who felt that consumers should be given waiver on late fee surcharge as many faced financial constraints during coronavirus pandemic. The scheme is likely to give relief to middle-class consumers, both urban and rural, who have a connection of less than 5KVA load. The OTS scheme will only be availed through an online process to avoid any discrepancy in future. According to highly placed sources in the electricity department, the scheme would be open to the public for 15 days and only those consumers who get themselves registered online by paying a minimum amount between Rs 1,000 and Rs 2,000 would qualify for the scheme. Consumers having 1-2 KVA load connections may have to pay Rs 1,000 as registration fee while those having 5 KVA load may have to pay Rs 2,000. The fee would be adjusted once the settlement is made, sources said. The six-month instalments to be fixed under the scheme would not be less than Rs 1,000. Those availing the scheme would be given the option to pay their dues in instalments in not more than six months. Sources in the department told TOI that financial implications to be borne by the electricity department was still being computed. Sources said the OTS scheme would also be applicable to those who have filed litigation in the court against the department. Such consumers would have to submit an affidavit that they would withdraw the case once their grievances are addressed under the scheme with mutual understanding. Even these consumers will have to register themselves online. For registration under the scheme, SDOs and executive engineers would be directed to hold camps, especially in rural areas where registrations would be available at CSC centres. The proposal will have the provision of levying surcharge on those defaulters who fail to deposit dues within the stipulated six months. Consumers had been demanding a waiver of surcharge on late payment of electricity bills citing coronavirus pandemic. While business activity stopped for many, others lost jobs or had to work without pay for months. According to political analysts, the waiver would certainly work as a sop as elections are just a few months away. They said the scheme would also help the BJP to counter the promises which the opposition parties could make to woo voters. As the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which has given relief to people in Delhi on the electricity front, is also in the fray, such waivers would not have come at a better time, they added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/up-govt-plans-ots-scheme-for-power-consumers/articleshow/86102167.cms||Rajiv Srivastava

But these sub-inspectors would be an additional thing who will facilitate the prosecutor in timely getting witnesses during hearings, will ensure furnishing of documents and evidences related to a case. They would bridge the gap between ACB and the prosecutors in cases.”He added that bureau does not want to take the accused advantage of any loopholes in the case. “For faster conviction, we need to present our cases properly. It was seen that many a times the ongoing system of having merely a constable from our side was not working. These SI rank officers who were taken after interview and checking their knowledge on legal affairs related to ACB cases will surely be beneficial,” Soni added.These officers would be working at two courts each in Jaipur, Bikaner, Ajmer, Udaipur, Kota, Jodhpur and Bhilwara and Alwar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/acb-appoints-si-rank-legal-officers-in-15-courts/articleshow/86102198.cms||Ashish Mehta

---||Chandigarh||Why CM unable to meet public: Bir Devinder||Chandigarh: The Shiromani Akali Dal (Sanyukt) has asked as to why Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh is “unable to meet general public to address their grievances”. Reacting to the chief minister’s “paradoxically vague official order” deputing three MLAs — Surinder Kumar Dawar, Raj Kumar Chabbewal, Kushaldeep Singh Dhillon — and chairman of Punjab agriculture marketing board Lal Singh for the redressal of grievances of the general public at the chief minister’s residence, SAD (Sanyukt)’s Bir Devinder Singh asked what was the need to “project protrusive proxies for this purpose”. Former deputy speaker of the Punjab assembly, Bir Devinder commented that interestingly the name of Patiala MP Praneet Kaur did not figure on the list, even though she is Capt Amarinder’s wife and a public figure in her own right. Terming the order as “absurd” and seemingly “indeterminate and ambiguous”, the SAD (Sanyukt) leader said, “First of all the chief minister must honestly tell the general public, why he himself is unable to meet them. The people of Punjab who elected him as the CM reserve the right to know the reason for his inability to meet them. Whether he is physically incapacitated or has developed some serious incurable and irremediable infirmity?” If that was the case, he should depute some of his ministers for the task assigned to an extracorporeal private panel for the redressal of public grievances, transgressing the authority of the ministers of his cabinet, and also over and above his dozen officers on special duties, he said. Bir Devinder said what haunted the public’s mind was what was the Punjab CM busy with, where was his actual place of residence, and why he was he befooling the public into going to go to a place where he did not live at all?||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/why-cm-unable-to-meet-public-bir-devinder/articleshow/86101582.cms||---

After the decision of the government, Traders’ Associations of Jaipur city have also postponed their plan to shut markets on September 11. The order for postponement was released by the director of local bodies Deepak Nandi after getting a nod from chief minister Ashok Gehlot. The order states that looking at the pandemic situation in which most of the traders in the Jaipur city have suffered losses, trade license is postponed at present. Both the corporations have been asked to withhold the implementation of trade licence and submit a report to the DLB. President of Jaipur Vyapaar Mahasangh Subash Goyal said that they do not support the postponment of the trade licence and it has to be revoked by the government. “We have postponed market shutdown on Saturday but if the government will again try to implement it, then we will once again begin our protest. Trade license is unfair towards the small business owners who have already suffered enough during pandemic. We want it to be revoked completely,” said Goyal. On Friday afternoon, JMC, Greater mayor Sheel Dabhai and MLA Rafiq Khan went to meet Subhash Goyal and other traders assuring them that they support the traders and this license will not be implemented. All the MLAs of JMC, Heritage have already extended their support to the traders and termed this license to be unfair. Under trade licence scheme every businessman involved in trade of private hospital, nursing home, coaching centre, clinic, library, hostel or PG, tobacco seller will have to get a license paying a fee, on yearly basis. A fixed amount according to every business has been decided which owners have to pay. Municipal corporation has said that Jaipur is not the first urban body to impose it. In Jodhpur Municipal Corporation, the trade license was implemented 25 years back. With UD tax not being collected by the corporation, it needs urgent financial aid to function however, it now has to wait for it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/after-gehlots-nod-trade-licence-scheme-shelved/articleshow/86102218.cms||---

It moved up four places from 10th last year to the sixth this year among universities and also improved its performance among all ranked institutions to occupy the 13th place, up from 16th last year. This when the more heralded Delhi University slipped a spot to be at 12th among universities and 19th overall. Jamia has been seriously working on the suggestion made to it by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) in 2015. These included improving the feedback mechanism, encouraging teachers to publish their research in journals with high impact factor and seeking international recognition by participating in the world university rankings. Vice-chancellor Najma Akhtar attributes the improvement to the teachers heeding the call to have their research published in high-impact journals. “The most important thing is, I give the teachers freedom to do what they want. We have asked the departments to hand-hold even those who haven’t been involved in research. Once this happens, everyone becomes motivated,” claimed Akhtar. “The university pays for the application process for research papers of high quality, selected by a special committee. It is our way of encouraging the teachers and promoting collaboration, not competition, among the various departments.” The published research papers have also helped Jamia get projects and grants from government agencies. “One such prominent project we got was from the Union government’s Department of Science and Technology, and we received quite a handsome amount for it. With the funds, Jamia was able to build an instrumentation facility to boost research work,” smiled Akhtar. As for the university adopting the NAAC recommendations, Mohammad Kasim, director, Internal Quality Assurance Cell, Jamia, explained, “The experts gave us several suggestions on where we could improve. We have been focusing on those suggestions, such as teaching-learning practices and information and communication technology integration.” Kasim said one important area was feedback, how Jamia assessed the teaching-learning and infrastructural facilities. “Earlier, we had limited feedback from the students. We have been able to extend it to all stakeholders — students, parents, alumni, industry and teachers,” he said. “We have identified the gaps and taken remedial measures. This has helped us improve the perceptions about the university, maybe not so substantially, but certainly marginally.” Jamia has also been regularly updating the curriculum, incorporating inputs from the alumni, industry representatives, focusing on outcome-based education and working towards digitisation of university processes. It has also been participating in various international rankings.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/research-in-focus-as-jamia-works-its-way-up-in-national-rankings/articleshow/86102216.cms||Shradha Chettri

In a meeting with officials, Rawat said action will be taken against those college principals who don't abide by the rule. The decision has been taken after it was found that many youngsters who were involved in the scuffle were not DAV College students. Meanwhile, the state higher education department said that it is drawing up plans to establish eight new degree colleges as announced by the CM recently. The department has already identified land for four of these colleges and the officials have claimed that these colleges will start operations from October 1 onwards. Rawat also asked the officials to take feedback from students on the newly announced scheme to provide tablet devices to over 1 lakh students.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/days-after-dav-college-ruckus-entry-without-id-banned-in-govt-colleges/articleshow/86100230.cms||Mohammad Anab

Speaking to media in Bathinda, Hayer said, “Just as the cotton crop was destroyed by the white fly during the previous Badal government, the cotton crop is getting damaged by pink bollworm due to negligence of the government.” He said while the PM Narendra Modi government was trying to destroy the farmers of Punjab through black laws, the agriculture department of the Punjab government headed by Capt Amarinder Singh failed in protecting crops and farmers. Hayer said an agriculture-oriented state liked Punjabi did not even have its own agriculture minister. “Due to pink bollworm farmers are into repeated sprays of pesticides due to which they have suffered financially and mentally,” he said. Hayer said deaths due to drug overdose were taking place daily. He said 9-10 youths had died in Bathinda district in the last few months, for which Amarinder Singh government was responsible. Hayer added the youth wing of the AAP in Punjab would hold a motorcycle rally from Bathinda to Patiala from September 20 to create awareness among the people of Punjab.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/aap-mla-says-capt-failed-to-save-farmers-youth/articleshow/86101605.cms||---
---||Delhi||State-of-the-art solar power station to ensure uninterrupted supply, says Jain||New Delhi: Delhi’s power minister Satyendar Jain on Friday inaugurated a state-of-the-art micro-grid solar power station and charging station in south Delhi’s Malviya Nagar area, which he said would ensure efficient load management and uninterrupted power supply. The Delhi government said in a statement that the micro-grid uses solar panels of 100 kilowatts peak to generate electricity and also has high-capacity energy storage batteries of 460 kilowatt-hour. The Rs 5.5 crore project of power discom BSES Rajdhani Power Limited is part of an Indo-German Solar Partnership Project. “I am highly grateful to the government of Germany for providing us with their assistance. This is a source of learning for us and we will keep experimenting and take this forward. The quality of this grid is very good,” Jain said after the inauguration, which was done in the presence of Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission chairperson Justice Shabihul Hasnain. “We will use this grid to further enhance the power infrastructure of Delhi and come up with some innovative solutions. This intervention is a revolution in the power sector and should be replicated on a larger scale,” the minister said. Jain said that the Delhi government would endeavour to scale up the project to ‘hundreds of megawatt’. “If we install such grids in the capacity of 10 jmegawatts or 20 megawatts at different places and make it reach up to 600 or 800 megawatts, then our energy fluctuation will be very minimal. This will make our grid system more robust,” he further stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/state-of-the-art-solar-power-station-to-ensure-uninterrupted-supply-says-jain/articleshow/86101612.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||AAP claims Rs 100cr ad scam by south corpn, BJP hits back||New Delhi: Aam Aadmi Party spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj on Friday alleged Rs 100 crore advertisement scam under South Delhi Municipal Corporation. In violation of the Supreme Court’s order, the BJP allowed a private company to earn more than Rs 100 crore through gantry and flyover panel advertisements. The Supreme Court has banned such advertisements because they can distract the drivers, he claimed. In a press conference, Bharadwaj stated, in view of the Supreme Court’s 2017 order, SDMC made its advertisement policy in which it reiterated that advertisements were not allowed on flyover panels. But advertisements and gantries have been put up in violation of the policy on Delhi-Noida DND. “These gantries are not allowed because they may distract the driver. Experts informed us that installations of such gantries has caused many accidents. Because of the carelessness and greed of the BJP, people have succumbed to accidents,” he alleged. “Four big gantries on the Delhi-Noida DND cost Rs 25 lakh per month each. Six smaller gantries are rented at a rate of 10 lakh per month each. There are two flyover panels at a rate of Rs 13.5 lakh per month each. If all these rates are added, then we can see that the south corporation is robbing Rs 1.87 crore per month. And if we add this cumulatively for 55 months, from when this policy came into existence, it comes out to be Rs 102 crore,” Bharadwaj claimed. “Despite the Delhi government giving them almost twice the funds they were getting earlier, BJP-led corporations have repeatedly claimed that their biggest problem is the lack of revenue and depleting funds. The corporations are not making money from 90% of the advertisement sites because the BJP has put up its own advertisements for free. Because of corruption, the BJP has choked its revenue channels,” the AAP functionary claimed. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said the allegations were politically motivated and aimed at maligning the image of SDMC. “Even the Delhi government is advertising on Delhi-Noida road. Does that mean that it is also feeding the private contractor,” he asked. Kapoor asked the Delhi government to release pending municipal funds.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aap-claims-rs-100cr-ad-scam-by-south-corpn-bjp-hits-back/articleshow/86101618.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Shiromani Akali Dal and Bharatiya Janata Party, who had been raising the issue, said the minister had to take the step following their complaint.Ashu, who has tweeted about it, said, “A lot of hue and cry has been raised by the opposition without checking the facts. Even as there is no foul play in the auction, I have asked the Punjab government to cancel it, just to come out clean and transparent on the issue. I have requested for a re-auction of this land. Those who were offering more money can participate in it.”However, SAD district president Ranjit Singh Dhillon and leaders Harish Rai Dhandha and Kamal Chaitley levelled more allegations against LIT chairman Raman Balasubramanium, Ashu and senior officials of local bodies department as well as LIT.Dhandha said, “We checked the previous auctions of LIT and found similar irregularities in most of them. In the allotment of 39 plots under locally displaced persons (LDP) category, too, Balasubramanium gave plots to their favourite persons and ignored the deserving ones.”About Ashu’s tweet, he said, “It is the result of our complaint filed with the ED, CBI, chief secretary of Punjab government, Vigilance Bureau and commissioner of police.” Chaitley said, “We will wait for a few days for action on the complaint, after which we will approach the Punjab and Haryana high court. If required, we will protest on roads. And why is the government auctioning the piece of land again? It should instead sell the land after making food court or simple shop-cum-offices.”BJP state executive committee member advocate Bikram Sidhu said, “Ashu’s tweet indicates bungling of crores of rupees in the property. The minister should be ready for more tweets as many other scams will be highlighted soon. The matter should not end here and the guilty, including the influential minister, LIT chairman and their associates, should be brought to book.”BJP district president Pushpinder Singhal, in a press statement, said, “After the BJP’s protest at LIT office, the cabinet minister had to recommend the cancellation of auction. It is not just our victory but of residents, too.” Balasubramanium refuted the SAD and the BJP allegations and said, “I have said it earlier also, final call is to be taken at government level. If auction gets cancelled, I have no issue with it.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/recommended-deal-cancellation-sought-re-auction-of-land-ashu/articleshow/86100994.cms||---

However, the plant management underplayed the day-long emission while left a back cloud hanging over a part of the city, claiming that they don’t have technology to control the emission during the light up (re-starting) after shutdown of every generation unit. TOI had brought to fore high emissions from the plant on September 5, based on a complaint lodged by environmentalist Dr Yogeshwar Dudhpachare. CSTPS chief engineer Pankaj Sapate explained that the coal fired thermal power plant uses furnace oil or light diesel oil to ignite the boiler first, and after the furnace reaches a desired temperature, pulverized coal is used to generate electricity. “This activity may take eight to 10 hours to reach the desired parameters of the furnace, and during this time black smoke may rise from the stack. However, Electrostatic Precipitators (ESP) are tuning up during such time to arrest dust particles,” he elucidated. He maintained that as it is a technical part of the boiler light up, scientifically it can’t be skipped. He maintained that there is no proven technology in the thermal power industry to completely capture the black smoke emitted from the stack during the light up process. He maintained efficient pollution control equipment is installed in the plant to arrest regular emissions. Complainant Dr Dudhpachare, who lives on the outskirts of plant premises, reiterated that old power generation units are responsible for high pollution from the plant. “At times when the guardian minister has ordered an inquiry into the high emission of CSTPS, its officials have confessed to being guilty of causing pollution at the time of light up of every unit in their statement,” he pointed out. He informed that high emission is a common phenomenon from the old stacks of CSTPS. The units no. III and IV having generation capacity of 210 MW each in the plant are over 35 years old and totally outdated. Even units V and VI having generation capacity of 500MW are nearly 30 years old and built using old technology. “The old units of CSTPS are outdated and need to be scrapped to save the lives of people of Chandrapur. A recent analytical report suggests that Chandrapur has seen over 52,000 patients of respiratory disorder during the last four years. There have been a total of 302 deaths due to pollution in Chandrapur between 2017 and 2021,” he pointed out.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-technology-to-stop-black-smoke-when-plant-starts-cstps/articleshow/86100879.cms||Mazhar Ali

The case relates to a young woman from Chhattisgarh, who had filed a complaint against Pandya at Vivek Vihar police station in Delhi on May 5, 2020. A zero FIR filed against Pandya and his wife, the same day, was subsequently transferred to Haridwar. After investigation, the police filed a final report on October 10, 2020. The woman complainant, meanwhile, went back on her charges and said she did not want to pursue the case in the court. The CJM's court, however, after hearing arguments on the final report, felt that "truth in the matter should come out". Hence, it ordered a fresh investigation. In the case, the plaintiff's statement was recorded under section 164 of the CrPC before the sessions court in Haridwar in the first week of June, 2020 and a video recording of the statement was done. In an application filed before the court, it was alleged that the survivor was raped by Pandya on three different occasions in July 2010. A minor at the time, she used to work in the kitchen at Shanti Kunj.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/final-report-by-police-in-pandya-rape-case-rejected/articleshow/86100267.cms||Sheo S Jaiswal

---||Ranchi||Lathicharge premeditated, says Deepak Prakash||RANCHI: Bharatiya Janata Party’s state president Deepak Prakash on Friday claimed that the lathi-charge by police on BJP workers and leaders near Jagannathpur in Ranchi on Wednesday was a planned assault targeted at him and former Jharkhand CM Babulal Marandi. “There was absolutely no provocation from our side. Our programme of Jharkhand Vidhan Sabha gherao was pre-announced. Our karyakartas marched peacefully for hours from Argora Maidan towards Jharkhand Vidhan Sabha. The common people were not inconvenienced. There were no communal remarks or acts of instigation from our end. Yet, the police resorted to lathi-charge within a few seconds after we reached the barricade,” Prakash claimed in a press conference at BJP headquarters in Harmu. “It has become clear that under the instructions of chief minister Hemant Soren, a few within the police targeted me and Babulal Marandi. They broke through our personal security ring and inflicted blows with lathis,” Prakash, a Rajya Sabha MP, said. His left arm in a sling, Prakash announced that the BJP will keep the agitation against the incumbent government’s minority appeasement going. “We will continue to raise our voice against the government’s anti-people policies and appeasement politics,” he said. Chandankyari MLA Amar Kumar Bauri said the assault on Prakash and Marandi was motivated. “They were attacked in a way that they get fatally wounded. And when I brought an adjournment motion in the assembly on Thursday to demand a judicial inquiry into the incident, the honorable Speaker did not even read it. I was hooted by Congress MLAs and was shown the door. It was shameful and also reflected what the Congress thought about lawmakers from the reserved categories,” Bauri said. Bauri also claimed that the government’s new recruitment regulations for filling vacancies in the third and fourth grade were also aimed at appeasement politics. “The government admitted in the assembly that the schools in the state do not teach Mundari, Kudukh, Khorta and Ho languages. These languages are only taught in colleges. Now, how will our children who speak these languages be able to make the cut? Whereas, those who can write Urdu will be able to get through as it has been included as a second language,” Bauri claimed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/lathicharge-premeditated-says-prakash/articleshow/86100794.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||Vadodara||Sardar Patel University becomes Gujarat’s first accredited green varsity||VADODARA/ ANAND: One of the greenest districts of Gujarat is now also home to state’s first green university. Vallabh Vidyanagar-based Sardar Patel University (SPU) in Anand district has been accredited as the first green university of Gujarat with platinum ranking. The ranking has been granted by Green Mentors, a United Nations General Assembly’s award-winning recognized institute for global green schooling and green university concepts. “The recognition is a tribute to Sardar Patel in 75th year of independence,” said SPU vice-chancellor professor Shirish Kulkarni. The university has not only utilised the existing green cover, a legacy of town’s founders but created another green belt at once barren satellite campus of biosciences department.  “We have enthusiastically perspired to develop a balanced ecosystem with more than 450 recorded species of various life forms including 90 tree species, more than 70 butterflies and spiders each, about 90 bird species and a number of other life forms,” said department head professor K C Patel. The campus development initiative taken up by Dr A S Reddy has transformed the otherwise 30-acres barren land into a biodiversity park. Students under Prof Ujjval Trivedi have not only shared more than 1,000 photos of various species on social media but have studied and prepared a checklist of different species. Now, a project of QR coding of trees is being carried out. “We have reduced use of papers to a great extent,” said SPU’s in-charge registrar Dr Jyoti Tiwari. “Majority of our departments have incorporated environment study, teaching and research in some or other way.” “Sustainable development is in the very roots of our university campus. A well-planned township having a green envelope of more than 80 species of trees planted on roadside, it has perhaps the highest number of trees in Gujarat in such a small area,” said Vibha Vaishnav, honorary director of Community Science Centre.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/spu-becomes-gujs-first-accredited-green-varsity/articleshow/86101109.cms||Prashant Rupera

No action, however, was taken by the hospital management till Friday and officials said a formal announcement will be made after Rims director Dr Kameshwar Prasad is available. Speaking on condition of anonymity, one of the members of the probe committee said, “Eight students have been found guilty of creating chaos in an inebriated condition and attacking seniors in men’s hostel after harassing a few juniors on September 4 night. The committee, after probing all the aspects and reasons behind the situation, has recommended disciplinary action against eight students.” The member said the students are from different batches and include undergraduates as well as postgraduates who were involved in the scuffle at hostel number 7. The member, however, refrained from using the term “ragging” despite complaint by juniors. The committee has submitted its report to the Dean, academic, Dr Satish Chandra and he confirmed that they were scheduled to meet director on the issue on Thursday evening. However, as Dr Prasad left for the national capital, a formal decision will be taken once he returns. “I have received a copy of the report and we were supposed to hold a meeting for taking further action. However, as director sir is on leave it has been postponed and we will be holding a meeting in this regard as soon as he returns,” said Dr Chandra. A member of Junior Doctor Association (JDA) who had demanded strict action against the students said that a 2016 batch student is the mastermind and he has been a serial offender. “We have demanded immediate suspension of all those who were found misbehaving with either juniors or seniors. Apart from that, there is a 2016 batch student who has also been involved in a scuffle with canteen persons and he too was involved in the incident,” said the JDA member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/rims-plans-action-against-8-students-for-ragging/articleshow/86101263.cms||Gaurav Pandey

According to police, the deceased was identified as Suresh Ajmera, a resident of Vardhman Society on Raiya Road in Rajkot. He is survived by a son, a daughter and wife. He had married seven years ago. Ajmera went to his friend Sanjay Koli’s residence in Shastri Nagar on Thursday night, police informed. Later, he requested Koli to go to Nana Mava Chokdi to collect Rs 40 lakh from a man named Hardik. “When he didn’t find the person at the spot, Koli called up Ajmera but the calls went unanswered. On returning, Koli found his house locked from inside. When he broke open the door, he saw Ajmera hanging from the ceiling fan,” police said. Sanjay found a suicide note besides Ajmera’s body which mentioned that he has taken a loan of Rs 25 lakh from one Mehboob and his son. The note further stated that despite returning the entire amount along with the interest, the lenders were demanding Rs 25,000 more. The harassment of the duo forced him to take the extreme step, the note added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/man-hangs-self-at-friends-home-in-rajkot/articleshow/86101389.cms||---

The celebrations will continue for the next few days but puja organisers have said that there’ll be no large gatherings and they see to it that the safety protocols are not violated under any circumstance. “The puja will be held for the next three days but we will not organise any cultural events on those days as it may lead to a gathering,” Jagriti Club president Lalchand Singh said. The Bala Ganapati Vilas Samiti (BGVS) organised its 103rd Ganesh puja and the celebrations will continue for the next nine days. “The priests will perform the rituals on all the nine days in accordance with the Covid-19 guidelines,” BGVS general secretary Anjaneyulu Rao said. In Chaibasa, the state’s oldest puja samiti, the Shiv Shankar Boys Club, is not organising its cultural fair for the second year in a row in view of the pandemic. However, the puja is going on as usual at an overbridge in Tungri. MP and state Congress working president Geeta Koda inaugurated the puja on Friday and offered her prayers as well. In Adityapur, the Young Boys Club organised the puja which was inaugurated by Voice of Humanity outfit founder Hari Singh. Meanwhile, unlike last year, this time the idol-makers are making a fortune selling Ganesha idols. “Last year, there was no sale but this year the business is encouraging,” idol-maker Manas Kumbhakar, who earned quite a handsome amount selling Ganesha idols in Kadma market on Thursday and Friday, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/steel-city-celebrates-ganesh-chaturthi-amid-strict-cov-norms/articleshow/86100776.cms||B Sridhar

The data was released on the eve of World Suicide Prevention Day by Jeevan, a city-based suicide prevention centre. It also issued helpline numbers (9955377500, 9955435508) to help denizens in need. The challenging period, from the third week of March to the middle of June, when Covid cases were reported in high numbers almost daily, the city recorded 84 suicides during the same period, the data showed. “During the pandemic peak, we also witnessed a jump in the number of the daily distress calls from 2 to 30,” said Jeoraj Jain, the director of the centre. He said in the first eight months of 2021, a total of 176 people died, including the 84 suicides during the Covid peak period. “Majority of the people who committed suicide were working,” Jain said. The data suggest 60% men and 30% women above 40 years of age have committed suicide while 10% were teens and youngsters. “Anxiety, fear and depression are the triggers that push the person to the brink of suicide,” said the founder of Jeevan, Mahaveer Ram, while sharing the data. The job scene was better during the second wave than the first but the slowdown in the manufacturing, automobile, hospitality sectors did affect the earnings of the denizens and suicides are linked to them, said the centre officials. Data suggests family problems linked to different issues, including monetary and general illness, largely are the cause of the suicides. “A considerable number of the distress calls were related to the fear of losing earnings due to the slowdown impact while some feared losing their own life after death of a kin from corona at home,” said Jain. Senior psychiatric Mahesh Hembram said obsessive compulsive disorder linked to Covid will ease with the end of the Covid pandemic. “Jamshedpur is an industrial and commercial town. Business condition of the factory and the subsidiaries linked to it impact the lives of the employees,” said the psychiatric. Jeevan data suggests that in 2020, a record 258 people committed suicide, the highest number so far. Earlier, in 2013, a total of 216 people took their own lives in the city. “Family support is a must to the person showing signs of distress and depression,” said M Durga Rao, the lady deputy director at Jeevan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jamshedpur/84-suicides-during-cov-second-wave-peak-in-steel-city/articleshow/86101307.cms||B Sridhar
---||Ranchi||Centre lauds Jharkhand efforts in implementing welfare schemes||RANCHI: The Union ministry of rural development (MoRD) has appreciated the efforts made by the Jharkhand State Livelihood Promotion Society (JSLPS) in planning strategies and its compliance to extend the centrally-sponsored social security welfare schemes among self-help group (SHG) members and their families. During a national review of the social schemes under MoRD, the department’s additional and joint secretaries appreciated the Beema Karayein Abhiyan taken up by JSLPS for different welfare projects. The exercise started on August 7 and covered 50% of beneficiaries under different insurance and pension funds within a month. According to official figures from the state, 62% of total targeted beneficiaries have been covered under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojna (PM-JAY) while 59% get benefits under the Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojna (PMSBY). JSLPS was also able to cover 51% beneficiaries under the Pradhan Mantri Jeewan Jyoti Beema Yojna (PMJJBY) and 26% of the Atal Pension Yojna (APY). Talking to TOI, JSLPS CEO Nancy Sahay said, “We have been able to cover 12,94,894 beneficiaries out of the targeted 20,91,290 under the PM-JAY health insurance scheme while 17,55,218 out of target 29,78,149 beneficiaries have been covered under the accident insurance scheme. Moreover, we have also covered 934,381 out of 18,15,680 beneficiaries under the PMJJBY, a life insurance scheme.” She also said 86,321 out of 337,760 beneficiaries have also been covered under the APY, a pension scheme of the Centre. Sahay credited the good coverage of the schemes to the banks as well as their staff members who actively participated in the special one-month drive. “We had started the Beema Karayein Abhiyan as a special initiative under which we ensured that proper information about the schemes reached the targeted beneficiaries.” She said the details about premiums as well as their benefits are communicated to each SHG member in detail. “After a few days of awareness programme, which included distribution of IEC material and through community radio as well as videos, we started getting good response and coverage within a month,” she added. Meanwhile, MoRD has directed JSLPS to cover all target population by the end of October. Sahay said they are confident of meeting the deadline, stressing that the beneficiaries can easily join as they can avail interest-free loans provided to them under the self-employment scheme to pay their premiums. Notably, PM-JAY provides a Rs 5-lakh medical coverage to every insured member. While PMSBY and PMJJBY gives a Rs 2-lakh security each in cases of a death and accident of an insured family member, APY is aimed at providing a steady income those who are 60 years or above.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/centre-lauds-state-efforts-in-implementing-welfare-schemes/articleshow/86101297.cms||Gaurav Pandey
---||Ranchi||House to probe tenancy act breaches||RANCHI: The decision of the Jharkhand government to form an assembly panel to probe all possible violations of century-old Chota Nagpur Tenancy (CNT) Act and Santhal Pargana Tenancy (SPT) Act is likely to put an end to the series of allegations leveled against chief minister Hemant Soren and his family members for such violations by the BJP. The government gave its nod to the formation of an assembly committee on the floor of the house during the monsoon session. Though the structure and composition of the committee is yet to be announced, Soren agreed to form a committee while answering a question raised by his own party member, Lobin Hembram, and supported by Stephen Marandi and Pradeep Yadav. Soren said though there is a provision for acquisition of tribal land for projects of public importance, it has been observed that using the gaps in the law, several fraudulent transfers have occurred in the state. “I personally believe that a committee can review all such transfers that were done through deceit and forgery,” he said. The decision is considered important in the wake of the fact that former chief minister Raghubar Das and other BJP leaders have been targeting none other than Soren and his family members for violating provisions of the Act by purchasing land outside their native village. The issue was raised by the BJP during its campaign ahead of the 2019 assembly elections. Das, while addressing a “jan chaupal” in Barhet constituency under Sahibganj district on September 2, 2019 had accused Shibu Soren and his sons (including Hemant Soren) of acquiring land in different districts of the state worth over Rs 500 crore. The BJP later sharpened its attack by accusing Soren of fraudulently registering a plot measuring 50 decimal in Ranchi in his wife Kalpana Soren’s name on which “Sohrai Bhavan”, a sprawling banquet hall, was constructed. Soren had claimed that there was no violation and he had challenged the then BJP government to table the SIT report that was formed to look into violations of CNT and SPT Acts. The SIT report was, however, never made public. It was early last year on February 15, 2020, that the BJP once again started raising the issue of Sohrai Bhavan when the party’s Rajya Sabha MP, Sameer Oraon, dared the government to probe land purchase by Kalpana Soren in Ranchi while reacting to the JMM government’s order to investigate irregularities in tender processes issued by the previous BJP government for various welfare projects. Welcoming decision to constitute the assembly committee, Stephen Marandi said it was necessary to clear the issues for once and all. “A panel was constituted earlier by Inder Singh Namdhari, when he was the speaker. A lot of information and evidences were collected but it remained inconclusive,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/house-to-probe-tenancy-act-breaches/articleshow/86100810.cms||Jaideep Deogharia

The release started with 20,000 cusecs and it is being maintained around 22,000 cusecs. The dam is currently 86.57% full, with 6,419 MCM (million cubic metre) of water at a level of 339.35 ft. The inflow has reduced to 1 lakh cusecs as against 1.43 lakh cusecs earlier on Friday and outflow is being maintained at 22,692 cusecs. The discharge from Hatnur Dam in Maharashtra has reduced to 54,102 cusecs. “Due to heavy rain in the catchment area of Ukai and release of water from the dam upstream, it was planned to gradually release up to 1 lakh cusecs. But with the rain subsiding and decrease in discharge from upstream dam, additional water will not be released and storage of up to 340 ft of rule level will be maintained,” said S R Mahakal, superintending engineer, Ukai circle. The reservoir’s four main hydro-power units, each of 75 megawatts, have started functioning with installed capacity of a total 300 megawatt. Release of 22,000 cusecs of water is required to activate all the four hydro-power units. Earlier, due to heavy inflow of water Ukai dam authorities had issued notification informing about discharge of 1 lakh cusecs downstream. However, the decision was changed later in the day. Meanwhile, different parts of Surat city received an average 10 mm rain on Friday. Varachha B zone received 20 mm, 15 mm rain was recorded in Rander while Central zone received 12 mm since 6 am on Friday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/22k-cusecs-of-water-being-released-from-ukai-reservoir/articleshow/86101240.cms||---

Police said that the leaders have been accused of various violations, including breaking of road barriers, interference with government work, damage of public property and violating the disaster management act by mobilising a crowd and not wearing masks when the Covid restrictions are still in place. On Wednesday, thousands of BJP workers, who were proceeding to gherao Vidhan Sabha, had broken barriers put up by the administration near the Jagannath temple leading to a lathi-charge by the cops. Circle officer (city) Amit Bhagat, who was present at the spot, had lodged an FIR against Ranchi MP Sanjay Seth, mayor Asha Lakra, former chairperson of the child rights protection committee Arti Kujur and other senior BJP leaders, including Amardeep Yadav, Pratul Sahdeo, Kamlesh Ram Kisley Tiwari, K K Gupta and others. Meanwhile, a case has also been lodged at Lalpur police station against six Ajsu-party leaders, including party president Sudesh Mahto, MP Chandra Prakash Choudhary, MLA Lambodar Mahto and party office-bearer Deosharan Bhagat, and 1,500 unidentified persons in connection with the interference of government work and manhandling of police personnel during their rally for 27% job reservation for OBCs at Morhabadi earlier this week. The administration, however, is yet to lodge a case against Congress in connection with the violation of Covid norms during the grand welcome accorded to newly-appointed state Congress president, Rajesh Thakur, and five working presidents, by the party workers at the Ranchi airport on August 29. At the event, many were seen without masks and found social distancing norms. Ranchi SDO Deepak Dubey said, “We are examining the video footage of the party’s event and action would be taken, if necessary.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/fir-against-bjp-leaders-for-cov-norms-violation/articleshow/86101285.cms||---
---||Ranchi||Ranchi mayor to move HC against AG||RANCHI: Mayor and municipal councillors have objected on the advice provided by advocate general on the day-to-day functioning of municipal bodies saying they will move Jharkhand High Court as his suggestions are in direct conflict with the Jharkhand Municipality Act, 2011. Addressing a news conference from her office, Ranchi mayor Asha Lakra, who was accompanied by Hazaribag mayor Roshni Tirkey, chairperson of Ramgarh and Chatra Municipal Council Yogesh Bediya and Gunja Devi among others said these kind of suggestions are coming as the state government wants to harass all urban local bodies which are ruled by the BJP. Addressing media persons, Lakra said how can an advocate general provide suggestions which are in direct conflict with the law by which urban local bodies are governed? “If the advocate general provides any legal opinion to state government which is not in sync with Jharkhand Municipality Act 2011, then I guess it is his personal opinion. However, I along with all other heads of ULBs, will continue to follow the municipal act and will challenge his opinion in Jharkhand High Court.” Lakra, who was a carrying a copy of Jharkhand Municipality Act during the news conference, cited provisions under sections 74,75,76,77, 78 and 87 of the act and said that all opinions by the advocate general in his letter to state government is completely baseless as he has only quoted the provisions as per state government convenience. “It is sad to see that JMM-led Hemant Soren government is trying to arm twist elected representatives and curtail their powers as part of their political vendetta. However, I have been elected by the people of this city which is way larger than a constituency CM Hemant Soren represents so I am not going to be a showpiece and allow the officers to do as they like,” said Lakra. The advocate general in his suggestions to principal secretary law, government of Jharkhand, has suggested that as per municipal Act, the ordinary meeting is to be convened by the municipal secretary (municipal comissioner) with a prior notice of 72 hours containing the list of businesses to all the councillors/chairperson/mayor. However, as per the provisions of section 74 of Jharkhand Municipality Act 2011, the municipal body has to convene its council meet at least once a month and mayor/chairperson has the right to call it as per their discretion or on written demand of one-fifth of the total councillors. Lakra also accused officials of carrying out works in municipal limit without prior approval of the Ranchi Municipal Corporation (RMC) board which is completely illegal and that is being done to help a few selected people. “RMC officials have gone ahead and carried out works in municipal limits without the board approval which is a mandatory process. But as they haven’t taken any approval now they are finding it difficult to pay to people who have done the work,” added Lakra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/ranchi-mayor-to-move-hc-against-ag/articleshow/86100843.cms||Gaurav Pandey

Hirabhai Rabari was suspended by city police commissioner Manoj Agarwal on Thursday for putting up critical posts about the functioning of the police force on social media platforms. “Despite repeated warnings, Rabari continued posting on social media criticizing the police force. Later, he refused to sign the suspension order in person. So, cops went to Rabari’s residence and pasted the suspension order on the door,” a source in the police department said. “Those police officers who are doing their duty dishonestly also receive salary but those who perform their duty honestly get eternal satisfaction. Higher officers do not take a note in the service book, but God takes note in his service book,” was Rabari’s last post on police force on Facebook. Sometime back, he had commented about police officers not wearing masks at a public place. “A few weeks ago, the Rajkot city police team went to Dwarka temple to hoist a religious flag (Dhaja). After performing pooja, the police officer clicked a group photograph. None of the personnel in the photograph was wearing a mask. Rabari had commented that if police were not following norms, why are they collecting fines from common people,” another source added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/police-dept-suspends-cop-for-criticism/articleshow/86101409.cms||---

As the House stood in attention, the melodious and haunting strains lingered in the air as a recorded version of the national anthem was played with interludes of subtle beats of traditional percussion instruments. The unique rendition of the national anthem with the infusion of an indigenous musical overtone played on local instruments in the background was an introduction and idea of Meghalaya Assembly Speaker Metbah Lyngdoh, a gifted musician himself. It was recorded at a city studio and jointly produced by renowned singer and composer Lamphang Syiemlieh and his local ensemble of artistes in collaboration with the Meghalaya Legislative Assembly Secretariat. Speaking about the making of the iconic item, Syiemlieh said, “The request from the Speaker was to come up with a version which everyone can understand and feel like it’s their national anthem.” “So, we did it in such a way that anyone can join together and sing the national anthem. The arrangement was a little bit difficult for me since it’s the national anthem and we cannot just do whatever we want,” he pointed out, adding that the Speaker had assisted in the entire endeavour. “I had help from Delhi, understanding the norms, laws and conditions that we have to abide by while working on the national anthem. But then the most beautiful thing is that there is a section in the Constitution that says we can improvise on the instruments, vocal arrangements,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/shillong/national-anthem-with-tribal-touch-in-meghalaya-house/articleshow/86107078.cms||Manosh Das

---||Guwahati||Assam still not following panel recommendations on ferry safety||GUWAHATI: The suggestions and recommendations of the government-appointed inquiry committee headed by Jishnu Barua, the then additional chief secretary of the state, after the 2018 ferry accident here, have not been implemented even now, exposing the indifferent attitude of the state government, which came to light after Wednesday’s boat tragedy in Jorhat district. There were two enquiries at the additional chief secretary level prior to the Jorhat accident, one in 2012 and the other in 2018, following similar tragedies. But the recommendations and suggestions have remained on paper only. An official at the state directorate of inland water transport (IWT), which operates 102 ferries, said mishap after mishap has been witnessed, but the government has not sat up and taken note. “The Inland Water Transport Regulatory Authority Act, 2018, has still not been enforced. The legislation aims to improve water transport and safety by bringing all mechanically-propelled vessels under a standardised set of operating norms. The act constitutes a regulatory authority (RA) to help streamline inland water transport. But the chairman of RA took charge only on Friday. While the other members have not been appointed yet,” the official told TOI. The Assam Cabinet on Thursday again appointed a one-man committee headed by the additional chief secretary, Maninder Singh, into the Jorhat tragedy, in which one person died and two others are still missing, and submit a report in a month’s time. The government also banned all single-engine private boats with immediate effect on Thursday. Jishnu Barua, who is now the chief secretary, had recommended in his enquiry report in 2019 that it would not be wise to discontinue all single-engine boats at one go but to phase them out slowly after the availability of a sufficient number of double-engine boats. “On September 7, 2018, the government suspended private mechanized boats (bhutbhuties) in all ferry systems. But neither IWT nor the district administration has sufficient personnel or a fool-proof mechanism to enforce the ban on plying of single engine boats,” said the Jishnu Barua Committee. IWT officials also said the department does not have an enforcement wing to check and monitor plying of single-engine boats. “There should be a dedicated team for such enforcement. IWT boats have never met with an accident. Private boats are running into rough weather be it the Guwahati ferry incident or Dhubri or Jorhat accident,” officials said, adding the IWT is also facing a staff crunch. All 10 posts of assistant executive engineers are lying vacant. The Barua panel had mentioned that all ferries and boats should have life jackets/life rafts, but this safety measure has not been followed even today. “The number of life jackets on a ferry or boat must correspond with the number of passengers. No exemption should be allowed on this front,” the report had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/state-govt-still-not-following-panel-recommendations-on-ferry-safety/articleshow/86107087.cms||Rokibuz Zaman

In the last assembly election held in March, 2017, NPP won 4 seats in the 60-member house. All four — L Jayantakumar Singh , Y Joykumar Singh , Letpao Haokip and N Kayisii — were given ministerial berths. Joykumar was given deputy CM’s post. The party, however, suffered a setback when chief minister N Biren Singh dropped Jayantakumar and Kayisii and retained Joykumar and Letpao in the major rejig in his council of ministers in September last year. Senior legislator Jayantakumar, who is also the working president of Manipur unit NPP, said a final decision to field the exact number of candidates would be decided after consulting with party president Conrad Sangma who is visiting Imphal on Saturday. Nevertheless, the party would field maximum candidates both in the hills and the valley, said Jayantakumar, while inaugurating an NPP unit office in the Keishampat area of Imphal city on Thursday.

Rescuers searched approximately 60km downstream of the incident site after a fisherman found the bag of one of the missing persons — Indreswar Borah — a teacher from Lakhimpur. The bag contained several documents, including the Aadhar card of his wife, but there was no sign of him or the other missing person — Dr Bikramjit Barua of Jorhat, who was posted at Majuli. One woman passenger, Parimita Das, died on the day of the incident while 89 other passengers of the boat have been rescued and traced alive till Friday. An official said that NDRF search teams used deep divers and sonar system at suspected places but no victim or bike, which were on the boat, could be traced. Union minister Sarbananda Sonowal, who was representing Majuli constituency when he was chief minister from 2016 to 2021, arrived at Majuli on Friday. He said both the Centre and the state government are committed to complete a bridge connecting Majuli with Jorhat within four years. “We all want a bridge on the Brahmaputra and both the state and central governments have taken necessary steps in this direction so that it is well constructed with the latest technology,” Sonowal said. He also said that central and state agencies will work in tandem to dredge the river Brahmaputra so that Ro Pax vessels could travel between Majuli and Jorhat in the winter season. He directed officials to strictly adhere to safety norms for passengers travelling in ferries and boats and urged them to expedite operations to find two persons, who are missing after the accident. Sonowal visited the family of Dr Bikramjit Baruah at their residence in Jorhat and assured them all support. He then met the injured persons who are being treated at Jorhat Medical College and Hospital and enquired about their health.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/iaf-joins-rescue-forces-to-trace-2-missing-persons/articleshow/86107089.cms||Prabin Kalita

The NIA had moved the HC in July, challenging the verdict of the NIA special court “discharging” Gogoi of all charges under the UAPA 1967 after finding no adequate materials to frame charges. Gogoi walked free on July 1 after spending 18 months and 20 days in jail. He contested the assembly elections from Sivasagar constituency from jail and won the battle. He is the first from Assam to win an election from jail.

Gyanendra Dev Tripathi, chief executive officer of the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA), told TOI, “The present situation in the state is safe. However, the scene may change at the time of the Puja. We review the situation weekly and on the basis of that, we decide on the regulations.” He added that a standard operating procedure will be published by the month-end. “There will be restrictions on gatherings inside and outside pandals. We have to wait for a few more days to get a clearer picture and then decide on the curbs,” he added. Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Friday said celebration of Durga Puja will be allowed under strict adherence to Covid-19 protocols. “We had imposed strict curbs for the celebration of Bohag Bihu in April. It is better to celebrate with caution,” he added. Appealing to the people to get vaccinated before Puja, he said, “There will be no need for strict curbs if people get fully vaccinated. I am told that some people are staying away from the second shot after the improvement in the Covid situation. There is no vaccine shortage in the state at present. I would appeal to the people to get vaccinated.” Biswajit Pegu, Kamrup (Metro) deputy commissioner, said the mechanism to grant permission to organise the Pujas will more or less remain the same like the previous year. “A thorough survey will be conducted before granting permission. There are over 400 puja committees,” the DC said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/celebrate-durga-puja-with-caution-get-vaxed-himanta/articleshow/86107096.cms||Mukut Das
---||Guwahati||Urea being ‘smuggled’ to Myanmar, says Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma||Guwahati: Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Friday said there is a shortage of urea in Assam due to black marketing. Farmers in the state, suspecting illegal diversion of urea, are demanding an inquiry into the shortage of the much-needed fertiliser. “We have received complaints that the fertiliser is being smuggled into neighbouring Myanmar. We are discussing with the fertiliser companies on how to stop the smuggling. Once the black market of fertilisers in the state stops, there will be no shortage of urea,” said Sarma, after reviewing various schemes implemented by the agriculture, horticulture and food processing department here. The shortage of urea fertiliser has hit the tea industry, as their consumption is high and other agri sectors hard in Assam. It has turned into a perennial one due to alleged lack of monitoring and vigilance by the agriculture department and the black marketing of urea by a section of unscrupulous traders. Urea is a must for the tea crop that is applied in three splits (phases) — March-April, June-July and August-September. Assam requires about 3.55 lakh MT of urea annually for 20 lakh hectares of crop field, including tea and rubber. But the data from the agriculture department revealed that there is a shortage of about 68,000 MT of urea till today which is a huge amount. The CM on Friday also directed that the agriculture department must be proactive in getting closer to the farmers and facilitating use of latest farming technology while providing them better market linkages. Being an agrarian state, agriculture has to be the primary driver of economy and the agriculture department must be one of the best units in the next five years, he said. He also told officials to maintain an asset register for the department to keep track of assets in various field offices of the department while creating a “permanent asset portal” within 15 days which will be updated every year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/urea-being-smuggled-to-myanmar-says-cm/articleshow/86107097.cms||Rokibuz Zaman

The sources told TOI that 150 CDF members led by 150 CNA cadres attacked the Myanmar army camp at Lungler (Lon Le in Myanmarse language) and overran the camp before the military council sent a few helicopters and two jet fighters to launch a counter attack. Lungler village is within Thantlang township of the Chin state, where 30 soldiers and police officials were deployed. Aerial attacks by helicopters and jet fighters could be seen from Thingsai village, a state policeman posted in the village said, adding that all the Thingsai villagers came out to watch the bombardment and could hear gunfire and explosions. A number of refugees have also reached Thingsai village, the policeman said. The armed encounter resulted in fresh entry of around 100 refugees from Thantlang township to Mizoram, who crossed the Myanmar-Mizoram border river Tiau and took shelter in Farkawn and Thekte villages in Champhai district where they were quarantined. “Fifteen people were on the other side of the Tiau river waiting to cross over due to unavailability of quarantine centres,” the CNA source said. Myanmar border villages, within the East Tuipui assembly constituency of Champhai district, have been overflowing with refugees from Myanmar. Nearly 200 people have taken refuge in Thekte village with 120 households, 800 refugees in Farkawn village with 700 households and around 100 refugees in Zawlsei which has 60 houses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/myanmar-military-civilians-clash-on-mizoram-border/articleshow/86107123.cms||HC Vanlalruata

The city, which has a population over 12 lakh and generates huge quantities of garbage per day, does not have a waste management plant yet. The Guwahati Municipal Corporation (GMC) has faced a challenge after the National Green Tribunal in 2019 ordered it to shift the West Boragaon dumping ground, which posed a threat to the fragile ecology of the Deepor Beel. In June, the landfill was shifted to Chandrapur, where the authorities had to stop dumping garbage after facing resistance from the local residents. The garbage is currently being dumped at East Boragaon. GMC commissioner Devasish Sharma said, “Three companies have qualified for the project of installation of the waste management plant at East Boragaon. Of them, one company will be awarded the project. I am spending more time to monitor the entire project to give relief to the city dwellers.” He added that the bio-methanation plant, which was installed at Chatribari area, is currently inactive. “The operation of the bio-methanation plant had to be suspended as less amount of compost was received during the nationwide lockdown last year. Around 30 tonnes of compost is needed to operate the plant. We are thinking of resuming operations of the plant again,” he said. Meanwhile, Sharma said the civic body is also thinking of installing an incinerator to burn the waste, which cannot be treated. “A portion of waste needs to be incinerated or dumped somewhere. We are thinking of installing an incinerator,” Sharma added. A total of 70 NGOs have been engaged for door-to-door collection of waste and transporting it to the dumping site .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/guwahati-to-get-waste-management-plant/articleshow/86107124.cms||Mukut Das

Here visitors wearing bermuda pants or half pants are barred from entering the office. A notice hung on the entry gate of the state government office in Gujarati language reads, “Atreni kacheri ni mulakat leta sarvey pensionaro tatha mulakatiyo ne janavanu ke kacheri ni mulakat wakhate barmudo ke half pant peheri kacheri ma pravesh karvo nahi (Pensioners and visitors are hereby informed that they shouldn’t enter the office wearing bermuda or half pants). Tushar Teredesai, an IT professional, learnt this the hard way on Thursday when he went to the pension office wearing formal shorts. “I was out for some work when my father, a former employee of MS University, called me and said that there were some issues with his monthly pension. I went to the pension office in Kuber Bhavan to inquire about it,” Teredesai said. “When I was inquiring about the issue, one of the employees walked up to me and said that wearing shorts in the office wasn’t allowed. At first, I thought he was joking so I just gave a casual smile. But the employee kept insisting that inappropriate dressing isn’t allowed in their office,” Teredesai told TOI. Teredesai then went to another room as he was looking for the concerned officer to resolve the issue. “That employee followed me to the other room and repeated that entering their office wearing shorts wasn’t allowed. He then asked me to read the notice put on the entry gate of the pension office. I read it and I was surprised,” he said. An irked Teredesai left the pension office without resolving the issue. “What’s so indecent about wearing shorts? And if some visitor or pensioner walks in wearing shorts, won’t his issues be addressed in the government office?” Teredesai questioned. A pension payment office employee said, “This signboard was placed several months ago to ensure that people don’t walk in wearing shorts. The younger generation won’t mind it but there are elderly persons working in the office and they won’t like people walking in wearing shorts. The visitors or pensioners come to this office for some work. They shouldn’t be dressed up as if they are going for a picnic.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/shorts-and-bermuda-pants-are-not-allowed-at-vadodara-pension-office/articleshow/86101126.cms||Tushar Tere

Experts say that sightings of the Sooty gull, also known by scientific name Ichthyaetus hemprichii, are very rare in India. Till now only ten sightings of the bird have been recorded across the country. The Sooty gull is found at Red Sea, Gulf of Aden and Pakistan, experts informed. Punit Kariya, a Porbandar-based businessman who has been passionately following wildlife photography for the last eight years, spotted the rare bird on Porbandar-Veraval highway in May. Kariya along with his son Konark was clicking birds when he sighted Sooty gull near Rangbai temple which is located around 10km from Porbandar. Kariya first sighted the bird on May 1. For the next few days he went back to the site so as to capture photographs of the bird. On May 3 he got lucky as he was able to click the Sooty gull. “After getting a closer look and clicking some photographs, we were sure that the bird was a Sooty gull. It had brown-grey upper-parts and a long two-coloured bill with a reddish tip. The birds under parts were whitish, with a greyish-brown fore-neck and upper breast. A whitish eye-lid was visible above the eye,” Kariya said. After observing the photographs clicked by Kariya, birdwatchers recently confirmed it as a Sooty gull. As per Karia the bird was roosting along with other gulls and terns. Karia visited the place for four consecutive days. The Sooty gull was sighted on two days during morning hours when there was low-tide. Prasad Gunpule, a birdwatcher who also edits a newsletter of birds, said that the Sooty gull is the latest addition to the state’s birds. “This is the first sighting of Gujarat. It was sighted in Pakistan and thereafter in Maharashtra and Karnataka,” he said. In Gujarat total 612 species of birds, including residents and migratory ones, are found.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/first-sighting-of-rare-sooty-gull-recorded-in-state/articleshow/86101483.cms||Nimesh Khakhariya

---||Guwahati||Cloud over role of former Nagaland governor RN Ravi as Naga peace talks interlocutor||GUWAHATI: The Centre is likely to either handle the Naga peace process directly without an interlocutor or replace the current one, former Nagaland governor RN Ravi, who was transferred as Tamil Nadu governor on Thursday, though the roles of the two posts are independent of each other. The last couple of rounds of talks with the NSCN (IM) was held by two senior officials of Intelligence Bureau without Ravi following opposition from the former, but so far there is no official word from the Centre on the status of Ravi as interlocutor. Further, the NSCN (IM) leadership has refused to enter into an agreement with the centre without the inclusion of their two primary demands of granting use of a separate Naga national flag and separate Naga constitution. Both demands are not on Ravi’s list and, therefore, the talks with the NSCN (IM) has so far remained inconclusive and has delayed the signing of the accord. On September 4, the MPs and intellectuals while participating in a conference, organised by the Naga Peoples Movement for Human Rights (NPMHR) in Delhi, expressed dismay at the “sudden derailment of the peace process, due to the wide trust deficit between the interlocutor RN Ravi and the representatives of the NSCN (IM).” Stating that the interlocutor is a mandatory link between the Centre and NSCN (IM), the participants resolved that “in the interest of peace, it is necessary to appoint an interlocutor who will re-establish the trust of the negotiating parties”. A top functionary of the NSCN’s (IM) rival, Naga National Political Groups (NNPG), a conglomerate of seven groups, which is in separate peace talks, said, “So far, the government of India has not issued any order that he (Ravi) has been replaced as an interlocutor so we consider that he is still the interlocutor.” The NSCN (IM) has not yet made any comment on the matter. The NNPGs functionary added, “We are looking for conclusion. The talks have already concluded on October 31, 2019, and with ceasefire by the Niki Sumi group, no one has been left out now. We are waiting for signing of the accord.” Ravi was appointed the interlocutor in 2014 when the NSCN (IM) was the only group at the discussion table. It was in 2017, under Ravi’s initiative for an all-inclusive peace settlement, seven factions of the NSCN came on one platform and identified themselves as NNPGs and started a parallel discussion with the Centre, which irked the NSCN (IM) and it soon fell out with Ravi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/guwahati/cloud-over-role-of-ravi-as-naga-peace-talks-interlocutor/articleshow/86107554.cms||Prabin Kalita

The university, which was founded in January 1857, has also gained several points with respect to peer perception in the past five years, scoring almost 20 points. With its improved performance in some of the key areas, CU figured just after IISc, JNU and BHU on the list, bypassing Jadavpur University, which ranked eighth, three rungs down from last year’s fifth position. “The ranking of the university at number four in the country and number one in the state is indicative of the collective zeal of our teachers, researchers, students and all other staff,” said CU vice-chancellor Sonali Chakravarti Banerjee. The NIRF rankings were published on Thursday. In 2017, CU ranked 16th, in 2018,14th, in 2019, it ranked fifth and in 2020, it slid down to the seventh position. In 2018, the university fared badly in the faculty-student ratio category, scoring 15 out of 30. In 2021, the score under this head was 24.21 out of 30. In 2020, the university scored 13.57 out of 20 in faculty with experience, but this time, the figure is 16.02 this year. The university’s peer perception score is also up from 37.39 out of 100 in 2019 to 45.77. But in 2020, the peer perception was 47.99. “The university created capital assets, excluding land and building worth Rs 26 crore. The amount spent on library and procuring new equipment for labs was over Rs 74 crore,” said an official. At 45.77, CU lagged behind JU in peer perception score by almost 21 points, but it beat JU by almost 10 points in faculty student ratio, four points in faculty with PhD and experience, 4.5 points in intellectual property and patents, 10 points in women diversity and 1.5 in region diversity. “Jadavpur University has faced a few issues in receiving grants over the past few years and that has impeded a lot of development. This reflected in the NIRF ranking this year,” said an official at Jadavpur University. Five colleges from the state also figured on NIRF Top 100. Of them, only one—Bethune College—is a government institute. St Xavier’s College, with a total score of 67.41, ranked fourth, Ramakrishna Mission Vidyamandira (67.26) ranked fifth, Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda Centenary College, Rahara (64.45) ranked 15th, Ramakrishna Mission Residential College (62.50) ranked 21st and Bethune College (52.23) ranked 77th. Bethune principal Krishna Roy said, “It is a matter of great pride that we are the only government college to be among the country’s Top 100. We are proud that we have been able to maintain the standard despite many adversities during pandemic.” (Inputs by Poulami Roy Banerjee)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/from-16th-in-2017-to-4th-in-2021-calcutta-university-climbs-nirf-ranking-ladder/articleshow/86107594.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Kochi||Investors afraid of ‘nokkukooli’ in Kerala: HC||KOCHI: Investors are afraid to come to Kerala due to ‘nokkukooli’ (gawking wages), the high court said on Friday while asking the state government why it is not acting against trade union workers who take law into their hands. Justice Devan Ramachandran questioned the government’s claim that the state is investor-friendly while considering a petition by a trader named TK Sundaresan of Anchal in Kollam seeking police protection against trade union workers demanding ‘nokkukooli’. During the hearing, the court said, “It’s not enough to claim that Kerala is an investment-friendly state, we have to live up to it. Why is the government not initiating action against trade unions taking the law into their own hands? I don’t understand the hesitation. If this goes on, no one will be ready to invest in the state.” The court also referred to the issue over demand for ‘nokkukooli’ by union workers with regard to ISRO’s heavy goods at Thiruvananthapuram and said such incidents result in humiliation of the state. Despite bringing in a ban on ‘nokkukooli’ a decade ago, it has not been implemented yet, the court pointed out while terming it as shameful. “As a citizen of this state, this issue concerns me,” the judge said. The court also added that the fear among people to invest in Kerala is the primary reason of fewer employment opportunities in the state. Telling the government that strict action should be taken against trade union workers and others demanding ‘nokkukooli’, the court said it cannot agree to trade unions in the state taking law into their hands. If union workers have any grievance, there should be a mechanism to redress it and the practice of physical abuse if somebody doesn’t agree to unloading by union workers is not correct, the court said. A counsel representing the state government said that 11 cases were registered over demand for ‘nokkukooli’ in the state since 2018. However, the court disagreed and said the fact that the actual number of incidents is higher is revealed by the large number of petitions before the high court seeking police protection against trade union workers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/investors-afraid-of-nokkukooli-in-kerala-hc/articleshow/86107587.cms||---

Rapidly growing leopard population in the state has spurred this policy of big cat celibacy at Sakkarbaug centre in Junagadh. Indeed, the rescued leopards are not given coed accommodation. The facility now houses 52 captive leopards — 24 males and 28 females — while it has space for only 60 animals overall. “The leopards captured from the wild are not allowed to breed at the rescue centre. The males and females are housed separately,” confirmed a senior Gujarat forest department official. ‘No value in conserving leopards’Each time the Sakkarbaug rescue centre hits its capacity, the leopards are transferred to a nearby rescue facility. Over the past two years, 108 leopards have been transferred from Sakkarbaug to Greens Zoological Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre (GZRRC) in Jamnagar. “We receive leopards at GZRRC from Sakkarbaug in line with our MoU with the Gujarat government,” said Parimal Nathwani, director, corporate affairs, RIL. Nathwani said, “We take care of the rescued leopards which are not fit for immediate release into the wild.” “Our aim is to serve injured and sick leopards and their orphaned cubs,” Nathwani said. Another forest department facility, at the Devalia range in Gir-Somnath district, already has about 40 leopards. Gujarat’s official wildlife census suggests that the leopard population sprang to 3,200 in 2021 from 1,395 in 2016. The decision to separate male and female leopard populations is based on an August 6, 2014, notification issued by the Central Zoo Authority (CZA). “Leopards and other prolifically breeding species inter alia do not have conservation value,” the notification said. “Leopards can mate and breed in any natural setting including sugarcane fields and shrubs,” said R D Kamboj, a former director of the Gujarat Ecological Education and Research (GEER) Foundation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-forced-brahmacharya-for-love-hunting-big-cats-as-captive-population-spikes/articleshow/86107817.cms||Soumitra Trivedi

---||Kozhikode||Muslim Students Federation Kerala president PK Navas arrested on Haritha’s complaint||KOZHIKODE: MSF state president PK Navas was arrested by the police and later let off on station bail on Friday in connection with the case registered on the complaint filed by the leaders of Haritha. The women’s wing of MSF had alleged that he had made anti-women and sexually-coloured remarks against his female counterparts recently. Chemmangad police recorded his arrest after he was asked to appear for interrogation at the police station before inspector C Anithakumari on Friday noon. He was booked under IPC Sections 354-A (1) (iv) (making sexually coloured remarks) and 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman). In their complaint, Haritha leaders said Navas had – during the MSF state committee meeting held in Kozhikode on June 22 – asked a Haritha leader to explain their opinion about an organizational matter with a remark, ‘even a prostitute would have a justification, you tell that’. Ten Haritha leaders had lodged a complaint with the women's commission which was forwarded to Kozhikode police chief AV George. The case was initially registered by Vellayil police and it was given to Chemmangad inspector of police later. Police had already recorded the statements of Haritha leaders. Police said the complaint had allegations against MSF Malappuram district general secretary Abdul Wahab and investigations in this regard were underway. Police have issued a notice to MSF state general secretary to produce the minutes of the MSF state committee meeting where the alleged sexually-coloured remarks were made. Meanwhile, Navas refuted allegations and said lies and half-truths were surfacing in the media over the issue. He added that he will meet the media with facts on the issue after getting the party’s nod. IUML had disbanded the state committee of Haritha after it had raised serious allegations against the three MSF leaders. The decision was taken on the grounds that Haritha state committee was continuously violating party discipline apparently over the refusal of Haritha leaders to comply with the party directive to withdraw the complaint they had lodged with the women’s commission against three MSF leaders, including Navas. On Aug 26, IUML leadership had announced a ‘reconciliation pact’ under which Haritha leaders were to withdraw the complaint but the party had limited action against MSF leaders to just an expression of regret. But, Haritha leaders remained firm in their demand for disciplinary action and refused to withdraw the complaint. Haritha leaders felt that they hadn’t received justice as IUML hadn’t taken disciplinary action and the regret expressed by the three leaders actually amounted to disparaging them as there was not even a sincere admission of having committed a wrong.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/muslim-students-federation-kerala-president-pk-navas-arrested-on-harithas-complaint/articleshow/86107996.cms||---

---||Amritsar||9/11 not over for American Sikhs, hate crimes continue||AMRITSAR: Despite all the awareness initiatives by the community, hate crimes against American Sikhs haven’t stopped after the September 11 attack on twin towers. Sikhs continue to be taken for bearded and turbaned Islamic militants, who declared war upon the US by crashing hijacked planes into twin towers and the Pentagon. The soft corner of the SFJ-like Sikh groups for Taliban has only bolstered the incorrect image and augmented the hostility. US rights activists and Punjab Foundation chairman Sukhi Chahal told TOI, “The post-9/11 identity crisis started a wave among the US Sikhs of cutting their hair and abandoning their turbans (two dear articles of their faith), because unable to discern between the 9/11 attackers and the Sikhs and unfamiliar with our ethos, the natives had started targeting us.” “No matter how much the Sikhs participate in humanitarian activities, the larger than life-size portraits in gurdwaras of controversial figures can’t be ignored. These images defeated the efforts at multiple levels to project Sikhs as a pacifist community.” Exposed to a fast lifestyle and caught in a grave identity crisis, the youth were first to toss their turbans. Asked about the campaigns to promote the distinct identity of Sikhs, Chahal said: “The US Sikh leadership failed to tell Sikhs apart from radical Muslims, because no matter what, to the Amricans we all look like Osama bin Laden and Taliban who planned terrorist attacks against the US and its allies.” Chahal said a Sikh leadership vacuum in the US left no one to create awareness against hate crime at the national level or educate the elected representatives about Sikh identity. After the twin towers fell on September 11, 2001, American Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (AGPC) president Pritpal Singh reported many attacks, both verbal and physical, on the US Sikhs because of mistaken identity. At many places, even their places of worship were targeted. Balbir Singh Sodhi was the first casualty. He took a bullet. Pritpal Singh said: “Gradually, we tried to educate the Americans about us. Sikh Coalition, United Sikhs, AGPC took hate crime cases to the courts and got the culprits punished, but we could not bridge the gap in American understanding of us. The Sikh organisations hold different political views but they united against hate crime, and the US government also supported us.” Mejindarpal Kaur, international legal director of NGO United Sikhs said: “The 9/11 changed the world forever, for Sikhs especially, as its suspects were described as ‘men who wore turbans’. Sikhs, thereafter, have to remove their turbans at the airports and face taunts at the workplace and public places because of this article of faith. Kirpan was banned from flights, examination halls, and offices. She still receives requests for advocacy support from global Sikhs for their right to wear the turban and the kirpan. American Sikh Caucus Committee executive director Harpreet Singh Sandhu, who works closely with the Congress, said: “On the 20th anniversary of 9/11, we are still saddened for the thousands of Americans’ lives lost on that horrific day. We are saddened further by the continuation of hate crime, and a spike in it over the last 5 years, as reported by the US justice department and Federal Bureau of Investigation.” SFJ’s soft corner for Taliban:Known India-basher Gurpatwant Singh Pannun of Sikhs for Justice (SFJ) has made matters worse for Sikh by his open support to Taliban. On how Pannun contributed to racism and hatred against Sikhs, US rights activist Sukhi Chahal said, “After ridiculous, provocative statements, threatening lawsuits, and radicalising the youth, he went ahead to say his Khalistan referendum team will also approach the Taliban. The American authorities and public catch every word. It will hurt Sikhs in the long run.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/9/11-not-over-for-sikhs-hate-crimes-continue/articleshow/86101619.cms||Yudhvir Rana

---||Kolkata||Didi files nomination for Bhowanipore; TMC says bypoll will rewrite history||EDITED/ 410 words Kolkata: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Friday filed her nomination papers for Bhowanipore assembly bypoll at 2pm at the Survey Building, with Ismat Hakim, Firhad Hakim’s wife, proposing her name like previous years. Banerjee left after greeting people with folded hands as Trinamool Congress supporters shouted slogans such as “Bhabanipur nijer ghorer meyekei chai (Bhowanipore wants her own daughter)” and “Bhabanipur-e Khela Hobe (Game will happen in Bhowanipore)”. “The people of Bhowanipore are eagerly waiting to rewrite history by ensuring Mamata Banerjee’s victory by a record margin. They are waiting to avenge the conspiracy that was hatched to defeat Mamata di in Nandigram,” Hakim, who accompanied her, told reporters. BJP has named lawyer Priyanka Tibrewal as its Bhowanipore candidate and Left Front has named another lawyer, Srijib Biswas. Congress has decided not to field a candidate against the CM. Banerjee too is a lawyer, graduating in law from Calcutta University in 1982. The CM’s nomination papers, which were later uploaded on the ECI website, said she doesn’t have property or land in her name, nor does she own any vehicle. Banerjee has declared that in FY 20-21 she earned a little over Rs 15 lakh, which is a little over Rs 5 lakh more than she had earned in FY 19-20. She further declared that she – a resident of 30B Harish Chatterjee Street – is herself a Bhowanipore voter. Banerjee had won from Bhowanipore in 2011 and 2016 but shifted this year to Nandigram — where the anti-farmland acquisition movement against the Left Front government had transformed her into a major political force in Bengal — to dare her former party colleague and now BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari on his turf. Though Banerjee powered Trinamool to a resounding win for a third straight term in office, she lost in Nandigram by 1,956 votes. She has challenged the Nandigram results in Calcutta High Court, which is hearing the matter. Banerjee is required to win a seat in the state assembly by November 5 in conformity with constitutional provisions in order to continue as chief minister. The Constitution allows a non-member of a state legislature or Parliament to continue in a ministerial position without getting elected only for six months. Banerjee was first elected to the assembly in a bypoll from Bhowanipore months after Trinamool stormed to office, ousting the 34-year-old Left Front dispensation in 2011. She had also represented for six times the South Kolkata Lok Sabha seat, of which Bhowanipore is a segment.

Salim Akhtar, from South Dinajpur, reportedly admitted the consignment was headed to China from Bangladesh via India and Nepal. The consigment was seized at 73 More, on the outskirts of Jalpaiguri town. Forest officials pleaded for Akhtar’s remand for 14 days, but the court granted six days. The officials, acting on a tip-off, managed to arrest Akhtar but those who were to receive the venom escaped. Red dragon stickers on the venom containers raised officials’ suspicion that these were meant for China. Bengal forest minister Jyotipriya Mullick expressed similar suspicion and said several people, including a schoolteacher, had been arrested earlier too while smuggling snake venom. Previous instances had alerted forest officials to the presence of a number of gangs that were using Jalpaiguri to smuggle out venom to neighbouring countries, particularly China.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/man-caught-with-rs-13-cr-cobra-venom-meant-for-china/articleshow/86102019.cms||Pinak Priya Bhattacharya

This is the central investigating agency’s third charge sheet in the Calcutta High Court-ordered probe into post-poll murder, rape and atrocities against women cases in West Bengal. Bagdi, vice-president of Khairashol Grameen Mandal, was allegedly beaten to death on June 12 at Nabasan village within Kankartala police station limits. According to sources, Bagdi and two others had reached the village in a private vehicle and were attacked by some locals. While the two others managed to escape, Bagdi was tied to a tree and beaten up. Police took him to Nakrakonda village hospital, where he was declared dead. The CBI filed the charge sheet against five persons, already arrested by the state police. The agency had taken court permission to conduct psycho-analysis of an accused. Birbhum district court public prosecutor Malay Mukherjee said: “There is nothing new that CBI has done. The psycho-analysis test result is yet to come. Significantly, they mentioned that both the victim and the accused belong to BJP and this could not be termed a murder due to political rivalry.” BJP’s district unit president Dhruba Saha said: “We heard that CBI filed a charge sheet in the case. There are 5 murder cases and 11 cases of atrocities against women in Birbhum. We hope CBI gives justice to the victims of post-poll violence.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/post-poll-violence-cbi-files-3rd-charge-sheet/articleshow/86102037.cms||Someswar Boral
---||Kolkata||Centre’s supply-side measures to revive economy have failed: Mitra||Kolkata: Bengal finance minister Amit Mitra has again urged Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman to pursue demand stimulus citing how supply-side policies have failed and there has been a fall in investment by Rs 2.2 lakh crore in the first quarter of 2021-22 compared to the pre-pandemic figure of 2019-20 despite numerous packages and corporate tax cuts. “You may be aware that gross fixed capital formation, as a proxy for investment, has simply failed to pick up. This, despite your supply-side stimulation,” he added. Mitra wrote that gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) in quarter 1 of 2029-20 was Rs 12.3 lakh crore. This fell to Rs 10.2 lakh crore in quarter 1 of 2021-22. He also pointed out the misplaced euphoria among government spokespersons on the GDP/GVA growth in quarter 1 of this financial year. “I would like to point out that the growth of GVA in the quarter 1 of this year represents a shortfall to the tune of 7.7% compared to the quarter 1 of 2019-20,” he added. Elaborating on the plight of the common people, Mitra mentioned five points: chronic unemployment, unprecedented reverse migration of workers, collapse of private consumption, persistent inflation cutting into meagre consumption expenditure of the poor and fall in consumer sentiment in August. The unemployment rate shot up to 8.3% in August, which implies that 3.6 crore people are jobless today, which is more than the population of Australia. Commenting on reverse migration, he wrote: “Reverse migration is a sign of distress where non-agricultural sectors are simply unable to provide employment. In fact, your periodic labour force survey shows that such reverse migration to agriculture is cutting salaries of workers by half,” he added. Mitra said it was shocking that wholesale price index rose by 12.1% (average of May, June and July 2021) and consumer price index posted a 6.06% rise (average of May, June and July this year). “May I remind you that private consumption constitutes 56% of our GDP. It is pathetic that private consumption in 2021-22 so far is almost identical to private consumption in 2017-18, four years ago,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/centres-supply-side-measures-to-revive-economy-have-failed-mitra/articleshow/86101984.cms||---

The development comes close on the heels of the varsity extending the suspension of its economics professor and faculty association president Sudipta Bhattacharyya by another month. The high court had asked the varsity to “keep in abeyance” the rustication of the students for three years. The notice from the proctor’s office to the principal of Vidya Bhavana late on Friday said the order had been complied with and advised “appropriate actions”. In another order issued on Thursday night, acting registrar Ashok Mahato had conveyed the decision to prolong suspension of the professor to the principal of Vidya Bhavana. A copy of the notification, also sent to the personal file of the professor, said Bhattacharyya had been put under suspension till October 6 on the ground that “disciplinary proceedings” against him were still pending. The university had earlier suspended the professor on January 7 and extended the same in phases till September 5. The new order suspends him for yet another month with retrospective effect from September 6. Bhattacharyya said he was seeking legal advice. “This is the reward I get from Visva-Bharati for participating in an agitation against the VC. I don’t know if the university statute allows such a prolonged period of suspension,” he added. Visva-Bharati has been mulling a “contempt application” in HC against a male student who lay prone on the road to block a university vehicle carrying the acting registrar and the deputy registrar earlier this week. A student has, on the other hand, lodged a complaint with Santiniketan police, saying the two officials abused women students and threatened to run over the male student.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/vb-follows-hc-order-puts-on-hold-rustication-of-3-students/articleshow/86101614.cms||Someswar Boral

I congratulate all GoWB officials for making this initiative a huge success. I thank the people of Bengal for coming to the camps and availing all benefits.” It may be recalled that since the first phase of the campaign started in 2020, Duare Sarkar has been a mega hit. In fact, it went a long way to help the Mamata Banerjee government return to power for the third time in a row. The 22,000-plus camps offer various services such as health insurance (Swasthya Sathi), food subsidy (Khadya Sathi), pension, scholarships, student credit cards and mutation of land. The second phase of Duare Sarkar has been a much bigger success with the chief minister announcing the Lakshmir Bhandar scheme for women aged between 25 and 60 years. The state government is offering a dole of Rs 500 a month to general category women under this direct benefit transfer scheme while those in the reserved category are entitled to Rs 1,000. An official said they had received nearly 2 crore applications for the scheme so far and the number was expected to rise to 2.5 crore by the time Duare Sarkar camps wrapped up on September 15.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/duare-sarkar-footfall-crosses-3-crore-cm-tweets-her-joy/articleshow/86101643.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Now, 20 years later, his family wants his picture to be installed at the Central Sikh Museum, Amritsar. They also want more efforts to be made to create awareness of Sikh identity in the US, as well as action against hate messages against the community in India. “We tried to see Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) president Bibi Jagir Kaur recently, but she was away. We wanted to request her that Balbir’s picture should be installed at the Central Sikh Museum, as he was the first Sikh victim of hate crimes in the US,” said his brother Jagjit Singh, who lives in their native village Passiwal in Kapurthala district along with his other brother Inderpal Singh. “We all seven brothers are settled here. Apart from agriculture, we have our cloth business in Nadala, a small town nearby. One of our brothers, Harjit Singh was into Sikh activism after Operation Bluestar and to escape police persecution he emigrated to the US in 1986. Later, in 1987-88, Balbir also went there and the rest of us followed and settled down in Arizona. I returned in 2001 and now most of the families from our village are in the same town,” he said. “Though several Sikh groups and activists have worked to create awareness about Sikh identity in the US, more needs to be done,” Jagjit added. “What is more shocking is that while Sikhs faced hate crimes in the US due to mistaken identity, back home in India, some elements have been spreading hate propaganda against Sikhs, as is evident during the farm movement. The Union government should take tough against such propaganda as hate messages prepare ground for violent hate crimes,” he argued. In the memory of their brother, the family gives scholarships every year to students who top in their studies at Guru Nanak Prem Karamsar College, Nadala, and also organises a volleyball tournament annually. ‘Need to check fights in gurdwaras’Sikhs continue facing hate in the US. It is not necessarily physical violence, several times it is conveyed through gestures. Sikh children are also facing problems. I know several families who tend to ignore it as every time you can’t lock horns everywhere with everybody. So, several cases remain unreported,” said North American Punjabi Association executive director Satnam Singh Chahal, living in Brentwood, California. “Though there have been efforts to create awareness, the Sikh community groups need to reassess the situation and restrategise. At the same time, the community needs to launch a result-oriented campaign against physical fights inside gurdwaras, as these leave a very bad impression in the local communities,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/create-awareness-of-sikh-identity-say-kin-of-first-hate-crime-victim-post-9/11/articleshow/86101642.cms||IP Singh
---||World||It’s not about choice: Biden mandates vaccine for most||WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden on Thursday used the full force of his presidency to push two-thirds of US workers to be vaccinated against the coronavirus, reaching into the private sector to mandate that all companies with more than 100 workers require vaccination or weekly testing. Biden also moved to mandate shots for health workers, federal contractors and the vast majority of federal workers, who could face disciplinary measures if they refuse. The sweeping actions are the most expansive he has taken to control the pandemic and will affect almost every aspect of society. They also reflect Biden’s frustration with the roughly 80 million Americans who are eligible for shots but have not gotten them. “We’ve been patient,” he said in a sharp message to those who refuse to be vaccinated. “But our patience is wearing thin. And your refusal has cost all of us.” “This is not about freedom or personal choice,” he added, in a swipe at Republican elected officials, including governors who have said the opposite. “It’s about protecting yourself and those around you....” Biden is acting through a combination of executive orders and new federal rules. Under his plan, private sector businesses that have 100 or more employees will have to require vaccination or mandatory weekly testing after the Occupational Safety and Health Administration drafts a rule. Roughly 17 million health workers employed by hospitals and other institutions that accept Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement will also face strict vaccination requirements, as will federal contractors and most federal workers. Biden previously required that federal staff be vaccinated or get tested. Federal workers now have 75 days to get vaccinated, or face termination. Federal workers unions suggested they would accept the vaccine mandate. Biden also ordered mandatory vaccination for nearly 3,00,000 educators at over 200 federally run schools. He announced that he would use the defence production act to increase production of rapid testing kits and would work with retailers, including Amazon and Walmart, to expand their availability. And he said US transportation security administration would double fines on passengers on airplanes, trains and buses who refuse to wear masks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/its-not-about-choice-biden-mandates-vaccine-for-most/articleshow/86107550.cms||---

There are currently roughly 1,50,000 new infections a day in the US. “That’s not even modestly good control,” Dr. Fauci told Axios. He added, “In a country of our size, you can’t be hanging around and having 1,00,000 infections a day. You’ve got to get well below 10,000 before you start feeling comfortable.” Case rates did fall to almost that level in June, when there were roughly 12,000 new infections per day, on average. But that was before the highly infectious Delta variant spread widely throughout the country, causing a major surge in cases and hospitalisations, especially in areas of the country with low vaccination rates.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/with-150k-virus-infections-daily-us-cases-are-more-than-10-times-too-high-fauci/articleshow/86108263.cms||---

Since its seizing power in Kabul, the Taliban have been facing intense pressure from Beijing, which has been vocal in expressing its concern over the Uighur militants of the East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM) fighting for the independence of Xinjiang, regrouping in Afghanistan. Many of the ETIM members have left Afghanistan because the Taliban have categorically told them that there is no place for anyone to use Afghanistan against other countries Taliban spokesperson Suhail Shaheen told China’s state-run Global Times. Shaheen said after the message, he did not see that “anyone, in any place” will be able to stay in Afghanistan, especially those “who are intending to carry out sabotage activities in other countries or have their foreign agenda”. He said in future, the counter-terrorism work will be conducted by the country's ministry of defence, ministry of interior and intelligence department. Shaheen, however, did not answer directly whether the Taliban will extradite ETIM members to China if Beijing requests it in the future, the report said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/taliban-tells-china-that-etim-militants-have-left-afghanistan/articleshow/86108465.cms||---

---||Kozhikode||Kerala govt sees red on VD Savarkar, VC denies it’s saffronisation||KOZHIKODE: The row over inclusion of writings of Hindutva ideologues MS Golwakar and V D Savarkar in the MA Governance and Politics syllabus of Kannur University appeared to evolve into a larger debate on whether non-mainstream or controversial works should become part of conventional syllabi, even as it put the government in a spot on Friday, with divisions cropping up among Left parties on the issue. The varsity has constituted a two-member panel --comprising political scientists Prof J Prabhash and Prof K S Pavithran -- to examine the syllabus and submit a report in five days. TimesViewGenuine leftists and liberals might wrinkle their nose at bad prose and reactionary ideas but would never stoop to proscribing books unpalatable to them or keeping such texts away from students. Keep your friends close, your enemies closer is often the approach of those convinced on being on the right side of history. In other words, know fully what the other side has to say so that you can intellectually demolish it all the better. Which is why it's surprising that the LDF govt and CPM are so rattled at the mere mention of including the works of Hindutva ideologues like Savarkar and Golwalkar in Kannur University's MA syllabus. Is it because of their own intellectual poverty?Higher education minister R Bindu on Friday termed the development as "highly sensitive" and said it was "dangerous" to have communal references in university syllabus, but toned down her reaction by the evening. “If the syllabus requires any change, the university will take appropriate steps. If some additions proposed are to be dropped, the university would do so," she said. Protests in varsity for second dayCM Pinarayi Vijayan also gave a similar reaction but said the government does not want to glorify ideologies and leaders who had turned away their faces from the Independence struggle. The university had included extracts from Savarkar’s “Hindutva: who is a Hindu”, and Golwalkar’s “Bunch of Thoughts” in the syllabus. Vice-chancellor Gopinath Ravindran justified the decision, saying the syllabus was aimed at enabling students to develop a critical understanding about various strands of Indian political thought. The varsity witnessed protests for the second day on Friday, with the AISF also taking out a protest march demanding withdrawal of the syllabus. KSU activists blocked the vicechancellor’s vehicle. Senior CPI leader Benoy Vishwam joined the opposition leaders in criticising the decision. Opposition leader V D Satheesan said the decision is condemnable. The issue, meanwhile, laid bare conflicting opinions in SFI, with Kannur University Students Union chairman M K Hassan supporting the decision and SFI state secretary K M Sachin Dev opposing it. The controversy brought up diverse opinions among academics as well. Historian and former ICHR chairman M G S Narayanan said it was imperative that students read all diverse strands of Indian political thought at the post-graduate level. “They should get an opportunity to compare and contrast different points of view. Also, it will help them in developing their own independent perspective,” he said. Political scientist and Kasargod central university former vice-chancellor G Gopakumar said it was unfortunate that holistic academic matters are used for petty political gains. “Political science is a liberal discipline. Those who speak against the syllabus should at least understand that Indian political thought is a prominent paper and works and philosophy of Savarkar, Golwalkar and Muhammad Ali Jinnah are part of this,” he said. “The demand to obfuscate the prominent political ideologies would be like asking political science students to study the second world war, without studying Hilter and Mussolini and their ideologies,” he added. P K Ravindran, educationist and former deputy director of the collegiate education department, however said students should be taught textbooks that will take them forward and not backward in time. “Universities should not be the place to promote retrograde ideas. It is wrong to teach youngsters textbooks and ideas that would take them centuries back. If those responsible for drafting the syllabus don’t take the matter seriously, they do not deserve to hold such positions,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/kerala-govt-sees-red-on-vd-savarkar-vc-denies-its-saffronisation/articleshow/86108299.cms||---
---||World||Difficult, debilitating: Man who assigned value to each 9/11 death||How much is a life worth? Within 11 days of the attack, the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund was up and running, grappling with this question. Making these tough decisions — how much each victim would have made in a lifetime — was special master Kenneth Roy Feinberg, an American attorney specialising in mediation and alternative dispute resolution. It was difficult, and it was painful, he told TOI. In the 33 months he was special master, Feinberg sanctioned $7.1 billion for about 5,300 families. The average compensation for death was about $2 million and average physical injury claim, $400,000. The fund did not discriminate based on citizenship — undocumented workers and foreign nationals were also compensated. And Feinberg, who has administered compensation programmes for the Virginia Tech shootings and BP Oil’s Deepwater Horizon oil spill, worked pro bono. “The idea that I would be paid compensation for providing people money following such a tragedy — I thought it would be inappropriate,” he said from Washington DC. The fund was created out of the law of torts, an act or omission that gives rise to injury or harm and amounts to a civil wrong for which courts impose liability. For the 9/11 attack, there were multiple potential lawsuits — against the airline, the WTC, private security companies. “The victim compensation fund was, according to Congress, a better alternative as it also saves families five to 10 years in courts, fighting cases they may not win,” Feinberg said. The Congress left it up to Feinberg to determine payment, without a cap on funding. It was taxpayer money and the compensation was tax-exempt. “The law is clear in the United States. Each family’s compensation is calculated by the economic loss suffered by the victim’s death. For example, a stockbroker makes more than a waiter or a policeman. So, as per the American legal system, a stockbroker (or their family) gets more money,” Feinberg said. Did that seem fair, valuing lives differently? “I wouldn’t call it fair. I don’t like to use words like ‘fair’ or ‘justice’. Money as a substitute for loss is pretty hollow, I must say. It is mercy — that’s a better word and that’s the American legal system. You must recognise how calculations are made. I would have much preferred to give every death the same value — all lives are equal.” Two families never litigated or opted into the fund. “A priest who lost a brother and said it was god’s will. And an 82-year-old woman who was so paralysed with grief over her loss that she did nothing and let her fund expire. I tried to convince them, but was unsuccessful.” What did make the job difficult, Feinberg said, was emotion. “Emotionally dealing with families in grief — angry and frustrated — was very difficult and debilitating.” Families would bring in trinkets, diplomas, medals of honours, recordings of last phone calls to show the lives of the loved ones they had lost. A woman, 26, came to see him one day, sobbing. “(She said), ‘Mr Feinberg, my husband was a firefighter. He died at the WTC and left me with our two children, aged 4 and 6. Now, you’re going to provide me with $2 million tax free and I want it in 30 days,” Feinberg said. “I told her, ‘Why do you need the money in 30 days?’ She said she had terminal cancer. ‘I have 10 weeks to live … Now my kids will be orphans. I must get this money while I still have my faculties to set up a trust and find a guardian.” So, they accelerated the payment. She died eight weeks later. The process also meant helping families find closure in acknowledgment. “One woman came to see me, crying. (She said she) lost her husband at WTC. He was a firefighter who helped rescue 40 people from the lobby. When he was running across the plaza to escape, he was killed when someone who jumped to their death from the 103rd floor hit him like a missile. ‘If he had taken one step either way, he would have been alive,’ (she said).” Sometimes, the ethical dilemma was overwhelming. “A woman came to see me and said she’d lost her firefighter husband at WTC. ‘He was Mr Mom,’ (she said). ‘Every day he wasn’t at the firehouse, he was home, spending time with the children, cooking meals, gardening — he was Mr Mom. The only reason I haven’t jumped to my death from the roof of my house is because of my three children. But I will never be the same without Mr Mom.’ The next day, I got a call from a lawyer, who said the wife didn’t know ‘Mr Mom’ had two more children with a girlfriend in Queens, New York. ‘When you cut your cheque from the 9/11 fund, he doesn’t have three surviving children but five.’ What can you do?” A film based on the struggle to compensate victims, starring Michael Keaton as Feinberg, was released this week. “After I wrote my book, ‘What is Life Worth?’, in 2005, I sold my book rights for a movie. For over 10 years, none was made,” Feinberg said. “I wasn’t sure if it was ever going to be made or be turned into an effective film! But it was. ‘Worth’ is a pretty accurate portrayal of the stress and horror we went through, and how we managed to succeed.” The fund, he said, was unique. “I don’t believe the government will ever replicate this fund. I believe this was a unique response to a historically unprecedented tragedy. And I believe the government reacted in haste and did the right thing ... Bad things happen to good people everyday in the United States and around the world and there is no public fund to provide compensation. There was no public fund after Hurricane Katrina and after the domestic terrorism events like the Oklahoma City bombings."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/difficult-debilitating-man-who-assigned-value-to-each-9/11-death/articleshow/86108596.cms||Priyanka A Chokhani

In a major setback for the Punjab government, the high court also ordered a complete stay on any investigation in all the FIRs pending against him. “Considering it to be a case of exceptional circumstances and hardship being caused to the petitioner by the State of Punjab (on political grounds), there will be a clear stay for the arrest of the petitioner in all cases pending or likely to be registered or registered or where he is sought to be implicated in the aid of Section 120-B IPC except FIR No. 77 (Multani murder case), where the matter is pending before the Supreme Court, till the general elections in the State of Punjab are held which are due in February 2022 onwards… There will be a clear stay for conducting further investigation in all the FIRs pending against him,” the HC ordered on Friday. Justice Arvind Singh Sangwan passed the orders after hearing a petition filed by Saini seeking directions to hand over investigation in any matter registered against him to CBI or to any other independent agency outside Punjab. Saini apprehended he would be falsely implicated in criminal cases on account of malice, mala fides and ulterior motives on the part of the political party in power in Punjab. Saini had also urged the HC to keep any proposal for arresting him, in any criminal matter, in abeyance for a specific period so as to enable him to seek recourse to his legal remedies. His counsel had also submitted that Punjab assembly polls are likely to held in February 2022 and the state government may adopt all illegal methods to arrest the former police chief by involving him in repeated cases. The Punjab government counsel submitted that the scope of Section 482 of CrPC cannot be expanded to grant blanket bail orders to a person, except in cases where special circumstances are made out. The matter has now been fixed for December 13 for the next hearing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/police-cant-arrest-ex-dgp-sumedh-singh-saini-till-assembly-polls-says-punjab-and-haryana-high-court/articleshow/86108629.cms||Ajay Sura
---||Business||Govt to limit incentive plan for auto to green vehicles||NEW DELHI: Petrol and diesel vehicles will not be included in the ambitious production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for automobiles as the government will restrict benefits of the Rs 26,000 crore scheme — slashed from the originally-planned Rs 57,000 crore — to green technologies such as electrics and those powered by the futuristic hydrogen fuel cells. The scheme, which could be announced as early as next week, is likely to be a dampener for top companies such as Maruti Suzuki, Honda (cars and twowheelers), Toyota, Renault-Nissan, Skoda-VW and many other auto companies that derive all their sales only from petrol, or diesel cars. Homegrown Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra, which have been pursuing electric and other clean technologies for many years, will stand to gain. Although the original plan was to have an allocation of Rs 57,000 crore over five years, starting 2022-23, the scope of the scheme has now been refined, government sources told TOI. The government believes that restricting incentives only for greens will prompt almost all the companies to urgently focus on getting electric and other sustainable technologies to the market, rather than wait for a mega customer transition. Apart from vehicles, the PLI scheme for automobiles will also provide benefits to auto components that are aimed at making vehicles green, or smarter. Categories that will be rewarded by incentives in the component industry will include those engaged in hybrid energy storage systems, collision warning gear, EV parts, automatic braking and blind spot detection parts, advanced driver assistance systems, and sensors of certain categories, sources told TOI. The original plan was seen to be far too wide, while the revised draft is now focused on the so-called new-age clean automobiles as part of the government’s aim to leapfrog into the next generation of green, connected and smart vehicles. The change in government strategy may push top car players such as Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai (it has only one imported electric Kona), to provide an aggressive thrust for electric and other green technologies to make the cut. Several of the existing players are currently seen as reluctant to switch over to electric vehicles as they look to maximise value of their investments in operational plants (producing petrol and diesel cars), prompting the government to incentivise those willing to make a quick transition, sources said. The Centre has argued that incentives for the two green technologies will fuel a significant growth in the share of hydrogen and battery-electric vehicles. With several international majors seen to be transitioning to electrics, the government is hoping to tap into what it believes will be a booming business in the coming years. Government officials said several companies as well as industry bodies, including Siam and Acma, have been consulted before formalising the plan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/govt-to-limit-incentive-plan-for-auto-to-green-vehicles/articleshow/86108772.cms||Pankaj Doval

While companies such as Skoda Auto Volkswagen have announced an expansion of their operations, with investments of over $850 million (around Rs 6,250 crore), others such as Kinetic Green Energy are looking to invest $300 million (around Rs 2,200 crore) in the electric mobility space, official sources said. Others such as C4V, a lithium-ion battery technology company, is investing over Rs 4,000 crore, while Japanese electric manufacturer Nidec too is evaluating an investment of over $200 million. Besides, Oman’s Bahwan International Holdings has held talks with the government for a potential investment of around $1 billion (Rs 7,350 crore), again in the electric mobility space, which also marks a transition from its initial start as an auto dealer. Government officials said that India remains an attractive market for automobile investments, and it was the failure of American businesses such as GM, Harley-Davidson and Ford to break into the highly competitive sector. Five of the players, who have been in talks are still evaluating their plans, but the others have moved ahead and have either commenced production or started construction, while there are three that have acquired land.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/cos-in-talks-to-invest-over-4-billion-in-auto-sector/articleshow/86108806.cms||---

Carrying a cash reward of Rs 1 lakh, Vijay had shot dead 16-year-old girl, Kajal Singh, in Gorakhpur last month. A resident of Gagha locality in Gorakhpur, Vijay had a dispute with Rajeev Nayan, an employee of the district court. On August 20, Vijay along with his four aides reached Rajeev’s house and started assaulting him. ‘Hunt on to nab gangster’s aide’When Rajeev’s teenage daughter Kajal tried to capture the attack on her mobile, Vijay shot her. She was rushed to Lucknow's KGMU where she died on August 25. The incident prompted the police to launch a massive manhunt for Vijay. With at least eight cases of murder, loot and extortion pending against him since 2018, Vijay went underground with his associates. “At least a dozen police teams were pressed into service to nab him. We were getting tip-offs about his movement but he was constantly changing his hideouts,” said ADG Gorakhpur zone Akhil Kumar, who monitored the police action against Vijay. SSP Gorakhpur Vipin Tada said during a routine checking of vehicles early Friday, police tried to intercept two persons on a motorcycle. “The duo tried to escape and when police chased them they opened fire. Police called back-up force and opened fire at the miscreants,” the SSP said. One miscreant, who was later identified as Vijay, suffered a gunshot wound while his associate managed to escape. The injured was taken to the Gagha CHC where doctors declared him dead. Police are now searching for Vijay’s associate who managed to escape.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/uttar-pradesh-gangster-who-shot-16-year-old-girl-for-making-video-killed/articleshow/86108812.cms||Arjumand Bano

The youngest of the children was seven years old, and the eldest 17. The driver survived but is in critical condition. The family was driving from Teka Naka in Nagpur to Patpara village in Chhindwara district, a distance of around 150km. “One of the victims, 35-year-old Nisha, was a native of Patpara, married in Nagpur,” additional SP Sanjeev Uike told TOI. Barely 30km from their destination, tragedy struck. A truck slammed into their car near Kherwada village. “The collision was so powerful that the car was sent careening off the road and close to a pond. The travelers were thrown from the vehicle,” said the ASP. Nisha, Divya, 7, Gulli, 14, Mayuri, 15, and Rahul, 17, died on the spot. Fourteenyear-old Mahie died in hospital. The bodies of Nisha and Divya were found after a long search in the darkness as they were flung several metres away. Driver locked the truck and ran awayAll the victims are residents of Teka Naka in ward number 4 of Nagpur. The truck stalled due to the accident. The driver locked it up and ran away. He was tracked down and arrested on Friday afternoon, the ASP said. “A case has been registered against the truck driver. The victims’ kin were informed last night and they came to the hospital,” Uike said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/5-children-among-6-of-nagpur-family-killed-in-madhya-pradesh-accident/articleshow/86108848.cms||---

The case pertains to one Bhanu Pratap, who was issued a duplicate SIM belonging to another person and transferred a total of Rs 68.5 lakh from IDBI bank to his other accounts. Later, he returned Rs 44 lakh but the victim is yet to receive the rest of the money. On May 25, 2017, Krishna Lal Nain’s Vodafone Idea mobile number stopped working. He went to the telecom company’s store in Hanumangarh and registered a complaint. Though he got a new number, it remained inactivated despite repeated complaints. In Jaipur, he went to one of the company’s stores and again submitted a complaint for SIM activation, which happened the next day. By then, the culprit had transferred Rs 68.5 lakh from Nain’s IDBI Bank account using the OTPs generated. Not only was the duplicate SIM card issued without proper verification of personal data, the delay in activation of the new SIM card and the transfer of money from the account during the period raised serious questions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/pay-rs-28-lakh-over-fraud-involving-duplicate-sim-vodafone-ordered-rajasthan-it-department/articleshow/86108846.cms||Srikanta Tripathy
---||Business||Assemble here to cut cost: Minister to Tesla||NEW DELHI: Tesla’s plan to import cars to India on duty concessions has hit a roadblock. The ministry of heavy industries, which sets the policy for the country’s automobile sector, has told the US electric auto giant that the government does not favour a reduction in duties based only on an “intent to invest”. The government has suggested that the Elon Musk-founded entity should begin its India business by starting with local assembly operations, and thereafter scale it up to full-fledged manufacturing. “Offering duty concessions when someone will consider investing after two-three years will be a reversal of a policy that we have followed for several years, and will be unfair to existing players,” a government source told TOI, adding that lower tariffs cannot be offered only to one company. The government fears that an industry-wide cut in customs duty will result in import of electric vehicles instead of companies, such as Ola, setting up manufacturing facilities. Tesla executives have been told that they should consider importing semi-knocked down (SKD) kits into the country and assemble them locally to attract lower duties, as opposed to importing completely built units. Tesla has told the government that it is already sourcing components from India for its global supply chain and proposes to scale it up. Musk had recently pitched for duty cut in India, as the company prepares to start sales . “We are hopeful that there will be at least a temporary tariff relief for electric vehicles. That would be much appreciated,” he had said during a conversation on Twitter. India maintains over 100% duty on imported vehicles as part of a strategy to encourage companies to manufacture domestically, a strategy that has seen several car makers set up shop in the country. It wants to adopt a similar strategy for EVs, with some officials arguing that government’s stand against offering similar concessions to Apple a few years ago resulted in iPhone maker getting its vendors to set up manufacturing facilities in the country. Several agencies such as NITI Aayog, transport ministry and the department for promotion of industry and internal trade are backing a cut in duties. But in the absence of support from the heavy industries ministry, the move is unlikely to go through.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/assemble-here-to-cut-cost-minister-to-tesla/articleshow/86108814.cms||Sidhartha

Junior Doctors Association (JUDA) went on indefinite strike on Wednesday demanding withdrawal of a government order to de-register three office-bearers of the association over an agitation in July. “We had a meeting with our dean, and he promised us that he would write to the government for our cause and ensure it is resolved. So, we called off our strike and everyone returned to work around 2pm on Friday,” JUDA state president Dr Arvind Meena told TOI. The agitating junior doctors at Gandhi Medical College in Bhopal were back at their posts on Friday afternoon. Meena is one of the three JUDA office bearers, whose registration the government had ordered to be cancelled over a strike around two months ago. On Thursday, the GMC Medical College dean served a notice to the junior doctors as the strike was adversely impacting patient services. MP JUDA office-bearers were ordered to vacate their hostels and warned of action under Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA). By Thursday evening,12 junior doctors were told to leave the GMC hostel. Soon, the number rose to 21. However, JUDA office-bearers threatened to be on strike all over the state if their demands were not met. The GMC administration met junior doctors on Friday and ended the stalemate.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-junior-doctors-call-off-strike-return-to-work/articleshow/86108884.cms||---

Following resistance from NTCA, the forest department has been forced to roll back a tender it had floated for film shoots of the world’s first intercontinental cheetah translocation at Kuno wildlife sanctuary. Hoping to cash in on the excitement over cheetahs, the forest department had issued a tender to grant exclusive filming rights. The opening bid was set at Rs 42 lakh. While forest officials refused to comment on why the tender was withdrawn, insiders said that NTCA strongly opposed the ‘e-auction’ for videographers to film the cheetahs. It wrote to senior forest officials asking why its approval was not sought before floating the tender, said an officer. “It has all the right to intervene in the cheetah reintroduction project as it is a nodal and funding agency,” said an IFS officer. A new tender will be floated after NTCA’s approval, said officers. There is a meeting scheduled between NTCA and wildlife officers next week. Meanwhile, weather conditions back home and violence in South Africa have impacted the project. A group of six officers, including some from WIIDehradun and Kuno, are waiting for clearance to board a flight to Africa for training. Flood and inconsistent rain have also slowed down the preparations. Those engaged in setting up enclosures inside Kuno are going through tough times transporting their equipment. The only bridge that connected Kuno and Shivpuri was damaged in the recent floods. The alternative routes are not suited to all kinds of vehicles. Officers feel it may take another four months to get the cheetahs to Kuno.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/national-tiger-conservation-authority-frowns-at-cheetah-project-film-shoot-madhya-pradesh-govt-cancels-tender/articleshow/86108950.cms||P Naveen
---||Business||Insurers asked to launch cyber risk cover soon||MUMBAI: Citing rising risks of cyber-attacks, the insurance regulator has asked non-life companies to launch individual cover soon and widen the scope of their existing cyber risk policies. The regulator has also recommended that insurers need not ask for a first information report (FIR) for losses below Rs 5,000 and settle them on the basis of an e-complaint at the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal. The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) has come out with a product structure for cyber insurance based on a working group constituted to bring about standardisation of wording of cyber liability insurance. The working group has decided that it is not desirable to have a standardised product, given the evolving nature of the legislation. The group has, however, come out with a model policy wording for personal cyber insurance cover. The regulator has urged companies to come out with cyber risks cover for individuals at the earliest, noting that the focus of such covers introduced by insurance companies has been on businesses, although individual customers are increasingly exposed. “An individual’s exposure to cyber risks is increasing with increase in exposure to the digital world. Considering the need for cyber insurance for individuals, IRDAI has charted out some salient features, coverage and suggestions in its guidance document on product structure for cyber insurance, which insurers can look to adopt,” said TA Ramalingam, chief technical officer, Bajaj Allianz General Insurance. He added that his company was the first to introduce cyber insurance for individuals. IRDAI wants insurance companies to be more specific in their language about excluding negligence. As per IRDAI, negligence can be an exclusion only when the loss is a direct consequence of negligence.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/insurers-asked-to-launch-cyber-risk-cover-soon/articleshow/86108842.cms||---

Cognizant said in July it planned to hire 30,000 freshers, as well as 100,000 laterals this year. The latter translates to onboarding nearly 300 experienced professionals every day. “Intent to hire and able to hire are two different things. To onboard about 400 laterals a day, you need to make offers to about 700 people a day, as most IT services enterprises have a drop out ratio of more than 40%,” said Kamal Karanth, co-founder of specialist staffing firm Xpheno. IT companies have robust hiring processes and large talent acquisition teams. “But even with that capability, this is a challenging year to hire laterals for sure. If the mix is 75:25 between freshers and laterals, then it’s feasible,” Karanth said. Offer acceptance rates have fallen dramatically, especially for skills with severe shortages. Xpheno data shows the offer acceptance rate at IT services companies for roles like fullstack engineer, data engineer, data scientist, DevOps engineers has dropped to about 45%, from over 80%. Saravanan Balasundaram, CEO of talent consultancy firm Han Digital, said onboarding as a proportion of total offers has dropped to less than 50% for IT services firms as employees are sitting on multiple offers. He said companies are taking exceptional approvals to make higher salary offers quickly so that candidates get less time to shop for other offers. “Some IT firms are willing to offer bonuses for early joining and are locking-in candidates at mid-level roles,” he added. Sriram Rajagopal, managing partner of talent solutions firm Diamondpick, said there has been an increase of 100% in salaries for critical roles in cloud, cloud native, mean stack developers (JavaScript-based framework for developing web applications). “Among our recent recruits, about 100 didn’t accept the offer and when we ran a survey, data showed that these specialised roles got a 94% increase in salaries from their current compensation. There are outliers who could get more,” he said. Rajagopal said those with Salesforce, S4 Hana and Snowflake certifications command very good premiums.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/it-cos-struggle-to-get-experienced-hands/articleshow/86108989.cms||Avik Das
---||Bhopal||Madhya Pradesh: 100% vaccine coverage by September 26, mega drive on PM Narendra Modi birthday, says CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan||BHOPAL: Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Friday urged the administration into a last-mile push for 100% vaccination, and set the deadline for September 26, four days earlier. So far, the target was to ensure 100% first dose coverage by September-end. He ordered a mega vax drive on September 17, PM Narendra Modi’s birthday. At a review meeting on Friday evening – a fortnight ahead of the new deadline – the CM ordered ward-wise compilation of data to identify those who haven’t taken the vaccine. Information regarding people who have gone out of villages and wards for work must be compiled and the rest vaccinated, he said. As on September 10, 75% of MP’s eligible population had been vaccinated, 17% of whom had got their second doses. Chouhan took a close look at the 17 districts where vaccination is less than 70%, and sought answers from the collectors. The Satna collector said they have enough vaccines but syringes are in short supply. The Chhindwara collector said that the pace of vaccination has been affected by festivals like Pola and Teej, and the Betul collector blamed heavy rain and festivals. In some places, vaccination has been postponed due to dengue and other seasonal fevers, said officials. The Mandla collector said that forest department teams have been deployed to speed up the vaccination campaign. ‘Must believe vac drive is of the people, for people, by people’Chouhan ordered a massive vaccination campaign statewide on the birthday of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on September 17. “Efforts must be made that 100% eligible citizens get the first dose on September 17. Remaining vaccinations should be compulsorily ensured by September 26,” said the CM, asking collectors to arrange for home vaccination of the differently-abled and senior citizens even in villages. “Vaccines should be made available in every district, as per requirement, and syringes should be provided to districts in proportion to the vaccine doses. Vaccination should not be affected due to mismatch of dosage and syringe availability,” Chouhan said. Crisis management groups and public representatives were urged to ensure 100% vaccination. “Everyone must feel and believe that vaccination is a campaign of the people, by the people for the people. This is essential,” the CM said. The districts recording less than 70% vaccination are Satna, Sheopur, Bhind, Dhar, Rewa, Sidhi, Khargone, Mandla, Morena, Katni, Balaghat, Chhindwara, Shivpuri, Singrauli, Barwani, Alirajpur and Betul.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-100-vaccine-coverage-by-september-26-mega-drive-on-pm-narendra-modi-birthday-says-cm-shivraj-singh-chouhan/articleshow/86108802.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Nine Punjab districts lagging far behind in Covid vaccination drive||CHANDIGARH: More than seven months after the anti-Covid vaccination drive took off, nine districts in Punjab --a state that saw heavy caseload during both the waves --have abysmal vaccine coverage. The analysis of data reveals that many districts have even failed to match the state’s average in administering first and second doses of vaccines, which is anyway less than many other states in the country. With the "inevitable" third wave of infection projected to hit by October, mass vaccination is viewed by health experts as the only hope along with adherence to Covid- appropriate behaviour in keeping the situation under control. Out of every 100, Punjab has so far managed to administer the first dose to 39.5 persons against the national average of 41. Even the neighbouring states of Himachal Pradesh and Haryana are faring better, having provided the first dose to 81.1 persons and 45.6 per 100, respectively. There are nine districts which are below the state's average. The data of coverage per 100 shows that only 29.3 have been vaccinated with the first dose in Sangrur, 30.1 in Fazilka, 31.3 in Mansa, 31.6 in Ferozepur, 32.8 in Bathinda, 35.9 in Amritsar, 36 in Tarn Taran, 36.4 in Moga and 38.1 in Barnala. There are five districts where over 50% of population has been inoculated, with Mohali topping the list by providing the first dose to 76.3% followed by Hoshiarpur at 55.9% Eleven districts are yet to match the state’s overall average. Punjab has so far managed to fully immunise 12.6 per 100, the figure of which stands at 27.4 in Himachal Pradesh, 15.9 in Haryana and 12.7 at All-India level. Mansa is at the bottom of the table with fully vaccination percentage of 6.8 per 100 while in Fazilka it is 6.9, in Ferozepur (7.3), Sangrur (7.5), Tarn Taran (8.4), Moga and Muktsar (9.1), Bathinda (9.2), Barnala (9.9), Amritsar (11) and Fatehgarh Sahib (11.1). According to health officials, Punjab earlier faced a shortage of vaccines hampering the immunisation drive. However, the availability of doses has improved since last month. "The vaccination has improved significantly ever since the supply of vaccines has been increased by the central government. Now, the drive has gained momentum," said Punjab health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu. Picking pace:Till September 9, a total of 2,115,654 doses were administered, which account for over 50% of 4,057,817 doses given in August — the highest monthly count of immunisation so far. In the last 15 days, the state has jabbed 153,433 per day on average.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/nine-punjab-districts-lagging-far-behind-in-covid-vaccination-drive/articleshow/86109019.cms||Vinod Kumar

Health minister Veena George said that with this, 88 contacts of the boy have tested negative so far. The minister said that samples of two contacts have been sent for testing to the National Institute of Virology, Pune and the results are awaited. Meanwhile, a team from National Institute of Virology, Pune along with officials from state forest department began steps to capture bats on Friday evening by spreading nets in a bat habitat at Kuttiyodu in Kodiyathur panchayat. Taking samples from live bats is crucial to identify the source of Nipah infection. The area where nets have been spread is part of the 3km containment zone around the house of the deceased boy which is a major bat habitat. Local residents said that hundreds of bats roost at the trees in the area which is near the banks of Iruvanji river. The nets were spread at around 7pm on Friday and officials who are part of the team are hopeful of collecting the trapped bats on Saturday morning. The team from NIV, Pune is led by Dr Mangesh Gokhale while forest department veterinary surgeons Dr Arun Zachariah and Dr Arun Sathyan are also part of the efforts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/nipah-case-15-more-contacts-test-negative-in-kerala/articleshow/86108849.cms||---

A decision in this regard was reached at higher education minister R Bindu’s meeting with college principals on Friday. Classes for junior semester students would be decided later considering the experience of the mechanism being put in place for the final year students, Bindu told reporters after the online meeting with principals. “To begin with, classes would be organised on alternate days. Teachers would reach the campus daily. A fresh order specifying the working time for colleges during this special arrangement would be issued soon. Institutions may opt for different shift timings, according to their convenience. Generally, the student strength in PG classes is below 20. Nothing prevents college authorities from organising daily classes for students of such classes,” Bindu said. A special vaccination drive would be held on college campuses to ensure that all students get at least one dose of the Covid vaccine. The drive would be held by coordinating respective DMOs, primary health centres, universities, and college campuses. “For the effective drive, the statistics of non-vaccinated students and teachers would be prepared. Covid vigilance committees would be set up on all campuses. Classes would be held adhering to Covid protocols, and college authorities are supposed to ensure availability of sanitiser, soap and handwash,” the minister said. Bindu said the department would ask district collectors to return certain college buildings that had been converted to CFLTCs. They will be also asked to relieve teachers who were given the charge of sectoral magistrates. “Colleges are being opened to overcome limitations of online classes. Online classes would be set up in all colleges. Principals have been asked to ensure that learning management system is introduced in their colleges. Principals would fix the schedule for blended classes, using online and offline facilities,” Bindhu said. She r said the government would make best efforts to ensure public transport facility for college-going students. “Institutional heads would arrange accommodation facilities at hostels by ensuring the adherence of Covid-19 protocol. Since only final year students are allowed on campuses, accommodation in hostels won’t be a risk,” Bindhu added||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/final-year-classes-on-shift-basis-from-october-4-in-kerala/articleshow/86109034.cms||---

In the last six days, among the active cases of 2,42,278, only 13% of the people had to be hospitalised, and among them, only 2% required oxygen beds. At present, lockdown restrictions are imposed in wards having a WIPR of more than 7%. The review meet now has decided to make the WIPR limit to 8% to impose restrictions. Antigen test has been now limited to people getting admitted to hospitals for various surgeries and other treatment purposes. For all remaining cases, testing will be done through RT-PCR. This is imp- lemented in districts where more than 80% of first dose vaccination has been covered. Now it has been decided to extend it to all the districts. The total vaccination in the state is fast approaching 80%, and presently, 78% people have been covered with the first dose, and 30% have taken the second dose. Among those above 45 years, 93% have received the first dose. Vijayan said the local bodies have been urged to ensure that those who testing positive are following quarantine rules. The responsibility lies with the local bodies and police department to ensure it. Motorcycle police squads are inspecting such people at ward level. In the last 24 hours, patrol teams have visited 23,419 houses in the state. In the last week, police have contacted 4,19,382 people in the contact list to ensure that they are under quarantine, he added. Other states have made it mandatory that the students coming there will have to take both vaccine doses. Hence it has been decided to conduct special drives to ensure that students going to other states are vaccinated. All district collectors have been directed to ensure that the migrant labourers are vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/some-relief-in-pandemic-situation-in-kerala-says-cm-pinarayi-vijayan/articleshow/86108882.cms||---
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Vicky Middukhera killers identified, hideouts raided in Delhi, Haryana||MOHALI: Police claimed to have identified the two killers of Youth Akali Dal leader Vicky Middukhera, calling them hardcore criminals involved in murders and extortions. A team of Mohali crime investigation agency has already raided suspected hideouts in Delhi and western Uttar Pradesh in search of the two gangsters, according to senior superintendent of police (SSP) Satinder Singh. The police have refused to reveal their names as it could impact the probe The SSP said, “The delay was because the two killers are not from Punjab region. They are also not known to local criminals. After much efforts and connecting evidence and leads, we are able to identify them. At present, we will not reveal their names, but one of them is a gangster from Haryana and the other from Delhi.”  On August 7, Vicky was shot dead by two persons while he was boarding his SUV in Sector 71. He had sustained 12 bullet injuries. The same day, the Devinder Bambiha gang had claimed responsibility for the murder in a post on Facebook. A day later, members of Lawrence Bishnoi gang members had pledged to avenge the killing. Gangster Sampat Nehra had posted on social medial, “You killed one, we will kill four – wait and watch.” Mohali police had grilled three gangsters Sukhpreet Singh alias Buddha, Aman Jaittu and Bhupi Rana, suspecting their role in the case. The three were taken on police remand after attaining production warrants for five to 10 days but police ruled they have nothing to reveal. The police had also questioned 35 to 40 other criminals associated with the Bambiha gang as well as others but did not get any success. Contract killing suspicion:SSP Satinder Singh said police have researched about the modus operandi of the gangsters and leant about their new working style. “We have learnt the gangsters are now swapping their places of crime. In this case, we found the gangsters of Punjab had engaged those active in other states, that is Haryana and Delhi, to execute the crime in Punjab, so that police may not be able to identify them. This was the major reason we took time to identify the criminals as they had no record in Punjab.” At present, the police are working on the theory of contract killing.

Some of them have expressed concern that the corporation’s image has been tarnished because of a few councillors and the mayor, while a few others feel the elected representatives should be “treated with dignity”. A meeting chaired by MCG commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja on Friday to resolve the standoff was attended by senior officials, workers and four councillors — Ashwani Sharma from ward number 19, Anoop Singh from ward number 6, Ashwani Sharma from ward number 23 and Naveen Dahiya from ward number 12. Sharma of ward number 23 said the MCG was getting a “bad name” because of five or six elected representatives and their relatives. “These people hurl abuses at MCG officials and put them under pressure to get their work done. Their works are complete on paper but not on the ground. The mayor acted under the influence of a few people. If family members of elected representatives continue to interfere, we are ready to approach even the PM,” he said. On Thursday, the MCG chief had issued an order that meetings related to the civic body’s business transactions and other administrative works should be attended only by its officials and elected representatives as per the provisions of the Haryana Municipal Corporation Act, 1994. “Family members of elected representatives have no right to attend House meetings,” Ahuja said during the meeting on Friday. Councillor Anoop Singh alleged that the mayor’s son had shouted at an MCG official in a House meeting. “When I raised an objection, the mayor said he was her PA. I said even if that is the case, he has no right to demean anyone or speak in the House meeting,” he said. Singh added that as the mayor is the city’s “first resident”, it sets a bad example if her son takes charge of a meeting she is chairing. Ashwani Sharma of ward number 19 said on several occasions during House meetings, family members of elected representatives raise issues and discuss agendas. “They can come and attend the meeting but they cannot give their suggestions, raise objections or question officials and other councillors. They also cannot sit on the seats of the elected representatives,” he said. Another councillor, who did not wish to be named, added, "The superintending engineer should be reinstated and those responsible for this mess should be taken to task. People who have no links with the MCG are approving its budget and approving estimates of crores,” said the councillor. However, the views were not shared by some other councillors likes Mahesh Dayma of ward number 30, who said the suspended SE should not have behaved in the manner that he did. “If an elected representative is questioning MCG officials, they can put forward their argument and answer the queries. However, it is wrong to just leave the meeting. This is disrespecting the chair of the mayor. It is a democratic country and officials should treat the elected representatives with dignity,” said Dayma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/mcg-spat-leaves-councillors-divided/articleshow/86101644.cms||Vishakha Chaman
---||Gurgaon||Staffers defer protest till Wed, to strike again if SE’s suspension is not revoked||Gurgaon: The MCG workers on Friday postponed their protest and gave officials time till Wednesday 5pm to get the suspension orders of superintending engineer (SE) Ramesh Sharma revoked, failing which they will strike on Thursday. The protest was deferred after an assurance from MCG commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja that the matter would be resolved soon. Three rounds of talks were held on Friday. Sources said Ahuja first sought 10 days from the protesters but they refused. They, however, said they could give three working days to the officials to resolve the matter. “Our only demand is to revoke the SE’s suspension. If the order is not withdrawn, we will resume the stir from Thursday. This is about the dignity of MCG employees,” said Naresh Malkat, state secretary, Nagar Palika Karmachari Sangh, Haryana. He added that if the demand is not met, the protest will take place across the state. The first round of talks began at 12 noon at the conference hall of the MCG office. Ahuja met the workers’ union, councillors and officials and asked the protesters to give him a representation mentioning their arguments and their demand that the suspension should be revoked. “I will follow the procedure and send the representation with my comments to the state government,” he said. He added the public should not suffer because of the strike and it is the responsibility of the corporation to provide uninterrupted services to the residents. The protesters told Ahuja that if an officer can be suspended in one day, he can also be reinstated in one day. When some councillors talked about ‘interference’ from family members of elected representatives, Ahuja said, “If the councillors have this opinion, a representation should be submitted from the House. Additional municipal commissioner Rohtash Bishnoi is the nodal officer to ensure that only elected representatives and MCG officials participate in the House and other administrative meetings.” Sources said Ahuja spoke to state government officials to resolve the matter, but revoking the order issued by home and ULB minister Anil Vij could be an uphill task.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/staffers-defer-protest-till-wed-to-strike-again-if-ses-suspension-is-not-revoked/articleshow/86101658.cms||Vishakha Chaman
---||Gurgaon||Mayor: If someone has seen my son in my chair, let them show evidence||In an interview to TOI, mayor Madhu Azad rejected allegations of nepotism and said an apology from suspended superintending engineer was the only way to end the current impasse with protesting MCG employees  It has been alleged that your son and councillors’ family members are running the show in MCG and making key decisions. Your response? I am running my city. If anyone has ever seen my son sitting on my chair, they should come with a photograph or some evidence. Where were the people questioning us now in the last four years? But your son has been seen participating in MCG meetings... Public meetings can be attended by residents of the city. They can raise the issues of their wards.  The MCG commissioner has issued an order that only elected representatives and officials will be allowed to sit in the meetings. Are you going to follow this and ask your son not to attend the meetings? The spouses of councillors don’t sit on the councillors’ seats in the meetings. They attend the meetings as residents and give suggestions towards the end. Women councillors also raise their agendas and talk about development in their wards.  Some councillors are saying MCG’s reputation is being tarnished because of you and a few councillors. Superintending engineer (SE) Ramesh Sharma is responsible for this entire mess. He crossed his limit and demeaned the mayor’s chair. I am here to work for the public and had told him to visit a site in order to resolve a public grievance. It was not my personal work. He did not give me a report even after four days and when I sought one, he misbehaved with me in a meeting in which 25 officials were present.  Do you plan to go and meet the protesting employees? I am a public representative. I’m not going to meet the protesters as I’m not the one at fault. Those protesting against the decision of home and urban local bodies minister Anil Vij are setting a wrong precedent. He took note of the fact that an officer left a meeting in the middle. He did not disrespect Madhu Azad’s seat, instead he demeaned the seat of the Gurgaon mayor. These officials get their salaries from public money and if they don’t work for the same public, what is the advantage of having them?  What do you think can end this impasse? The only solution to end this deadlock is that the SE should admit his mistake and apologise. The minister has taken the decision on the SE’s suspension and will decide on this matter. I cannot do anything about it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/mayor-if-someone-has-seen-my-son-in-my-chair-let-them-show-evidence/articleshow/86101669.cms||Vishakha Chaman

The senior Congress leader also attached an old news clipping of Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath saying that women are “not capable of being left free or independent” and that “their energy should be regulated, lest it become worthless and destructive”. “Is it Yogi ji?

According to the police, her husband is the prime suspect in the case as he is absconding. The woman, identified as Rezia Biwi (27), used to work as a domestic helper. She was married to Hansa Munj, a mason, a year ago and were residing in Ghata area and had shifted to South City-1 a month ago. The neighbours were the first to notice the lifeless body of Rezia on Friday afternoon. As they hadn’t seen her from morning, a few of them peeped inside the house from a window and saw the woman lying on the ground. They alerted the police and a team from Sector 40 police station reached the house. “Normally people wake up early in the locality and as we have a common toilet, so it is unusual to not see anyone coming out of the house. AS Rezia wasn’t noticed by anyone till the afternoon a few locals reached her house to enquire. That’s when they spotted her on the floor,” said a neighbour, adding that they had not witnessed any dispute between the couple. Station house officer (SHO) of Sector 40 police station, inspector Surender Phogat, said the postmortem report confirms murder. The woman was strangled. The body has been handed over to the family and an FIR has been registered under Section 302 (murder) of the IPC. “She was strangled to death and her husband is the prime suspect. But reason of murder is still not clear yest,” said the SHO adding that prima facie it seemed the accused strangled his wife after an argument in the middle of the night and fled from the house. No one witnessed him leaving the colony. “We are scanning the CCTV footage to find out when he left the area,” SHO Phogat said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/woman-strangled-husband-absconding-cops-suspect-his-role/articleshow/86101682.cms||---
---||Gurgaon||70% work done, but revamp of Huda City Centre set to miss Oct deadline||Gurgaon: The project to revamp the Huda City Centre junction is likely to miss its latest October 31 deadline as officials of the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) said that around 30% of the work is yet to be completed. Started in July 2019, the project was initially expected to be completed in 12 months. It involves the construction of a 705-metre-long unidirectional underpass meant for commuters travelling from the direction of Signature Tower towards Subhash Chowk, and a 269.5-metre-long bidirectional flyover between MF Husain Marg and the Sector road. Two foot overbridges, equipped with escalators, lifts, and stairs, will also be set up as part of the project — one on the road towards Signature Tower, and another on the road towards IFFCO Chowk road. The project is expected to cost Rs 43.07 crore. “The deadline is October 31, but there is an issue. There is a 66 kV electric tower in the path of one of the foot overbridges, because of which there is some delay. The construction of the other structures is under way, but it seems that it will take another three months. We are trying to wind up the work as quickly as possible,” said Jaspal Singh, chief engineer (infrastructure-I), GMDA. Another GMDA official, who did not want to be named, said the delays in the project have been due to “many reasons”, including the monsoon and the pandemic, as well as some “hindrances”, such as a water supply line that had to be shifted. “At present, the electric tower in the way of one of the foot overbridges is the only hindrance. We have requested the Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN) for shifting this as well. The matter is under process,” said the official. “Around 70% of the work on the project has been done. We expect it will be completed by November or December,” the official added. This is the third deadline set this year that the revamp project is going to miss. Earlier, a deadline of March had been set for the project, which was later changed to June, and subsequently to October. The HUDA City Centre is a critical junction in the city since it serves as the point where traffic moving from the direction of Netaji Subhash Marg converges with that from the Mehrauli Gurgaon road. It is also the point where the final metro station on the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation’s (DMRC) yellow line is located, leading to heavy traffic as well as high pedestrian footfall in the area.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/70-work-done-but-revamp-of-huda-city-centre-set-to-miss-oct-deadline/articleshow/86101696.cms||Sakshi Dayal

The Tawa railway bridge, under West Central Railway (WCR) on Itarsi-Jabalpur route on Tawa river, was constructed in 1870 and continues to remain in use. WCR said that special attention is being given for further use of the bridge. CPRO (WCR), Rahul Jaipuriyar said that Tawa railway bridge is a heritage of Indian railway. “Even after such long time the bridge is still in use. WCR has given special attention to the bridge by regular inspection and other maintenance work,” said Jaipuriyar. Asked about how long the bridge will continue for traffic, Jaipuriyar said that there was no problem as of now with regards to the bridge. “The technology used in the construction of the bridge 150 years ago has now stopped. Still, the bridge has continue offering its services as WCR has done a lot of work to maintain it,” said Jaipuriyar. Before India’s independence, the East India Railway (EIR) and the Great Indian Peninsula Railway (GIPR) played an important role in running trains and building railway lines in India. These two companies joined together in 1870 for the first rail-link between Mumbai and Calcutta in Jabalpur. The 1,000-ft long bridge was regirded in 1927 after it was constructed in 1870. This bridge is located on Tawa river at a distance of 7 km from Tawa dam. “This bridge has 2 spans of 132 ft and web girder below four span of 202 ft. Along with this, five piers and two abutments which are made of ashlar fine masonry of that time. The height of the bridge is 22 meters. The work of doubling of this section was commissioned by Indian Railways in February 2020. At present, an additional new Tawa bridge has been constructed by West Central Railway on Tawa river. In today's date, the capacity of the railway section has been increased after constructing up and down railway line on Tawa river,” added Jaipuriyar. The original Tawa bridge and Bagaratwa tunnel on this railway line was completed withing 19 months on March 8, 1870 by Robert Maitland Brereton, civil engineer of East Indian Railway and Great Indian Peninsula Railway.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-over-150-years-on-west-central-railways-tawa-railway-bridge-stands-strong/articleshow/86109155.cms||Ramendra Singh

The regional health director's office record suggested that only 14,555 new TB cases against a target of 24850 were identified in the division between January and July this year. Burhanpur however achieved 97% of its target by notifying 1420 cases in the first six months this year. “Districts with more cases of Covid-19 during the second wave achieved less in other programmes including TB eradication”, said Dr Ashok Dagaria, regional director health services Indore division. The second wave almost killed three months- April, May and June, for staff to work on other programmes affecting them badly. The districts however ran a one-month doorto-door survey during August in highrisk areas and population to identify new cases, said Dr Dagaria.“A two month long similar door-to-door survey is going on from September 2 to November 1 to achieve the annual target”, added Dr Dagaria. During these surveys, the grassroot workers visited those houses, areas, where any case of tuberculosis were reported in the last three years.All such areas were surveyed to find out new cases. The contacts of all currently positive tuberculosis including their family members and surrounding houses were surveyed to detect possible cases. Indore DTO Dr Rahul Srivastava said, “In Aug, we have achieved more than 22% of target for the month with identification of around 600 new cases through door-to-door survey.” “We are hopeful to achieve our target after the second such door-to-door survey ongoing from Sept 2 to Nov 1”, claimed Dr Srivastava.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/indore/amid-covid-indore-division-falls-behind-in-detecting-new-tb-cases/articleshow/86109194.cms||Antriksh Singh

A man has padded up for a long innings in his government accommodation despite retirement. Hitting out at the failure of the UT administration to provide a flat to him under the UT Employees Housing Scheme-2008, the retired staffer has extended his stay in his borrowed home. Going a step further, he has cited a condition in the agreement for not having any new place to shift. Parvesh Kumar had retired on March 31 from the post of superintendent, grade II, health department. He was allotted house no. 1, ayurvedic dispensary, Sector 37 D, Chandigarh. Kumar said he had succeeded in CHB’s UT Employees Housing scheme-2008 draw of lots for one BHK flat having a value of Rs 10 to Rs 13 lakh in 2010. The possession of the flat is awaited. “A condition of the scheme refrained me from having any other residential property in my name or in the name of family in Chandigarh, Panchkula and Mohali till the possession of CHB’s flat. So, I could not own a house to reside elsewhere,” he said. It was in March he had requested the UT to allow him to retain the accommodation after retirement till the date of possession of CHB flat. But he was ordered to vacate the house or face action and pay 100 times the rent for the first three months of overstay and 200 times from the fourth month, he said. Kumar has now written a letter to the administration, asking it to treat the legal notice, that he should not be evicted from government accommodation and not directed to pay penal rent till the physical possession of the CHB flat. He even sought directions to the CHB, which is an undertaking of UT administration, to complete the scheme. He even demanded that the rent of the government accommodation of overstaying be paid by the CHB and to buy back his residential flat, which he had got in the draw for Rs 95 lakh (market value). A senior UT official said that the matter of UT employees housing scheme in pending in the Punjab and Haryana high court. Housing scheme status:Failed to get any relief from the UT administration, the UT employees had recently written to home minister Amit Shah and union government to delink UT Employees Housing Scheme-2008 from the MHA’s order of 2012 and calculate prices of flats on the basis of rates published on scheme’s brochure in 2008 instead of collector rates of 2016||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/chandigarh-no-chb-flat-wont-vacate-government-house-says-ex-staffer/articleshow/86109236.cms||Rajinder Nagarkoti

Since this particular segment has already been passed and approved in the annual financial budget by the administration, the cash-strapped civic body has been taking this plea while pushing its case firmly, considering it as a major source of revenue generation. “As per the municipal Act, it is the MC’s right to charge the electricity duty. Instead, the administration has been charging this amount for the past many years. We have attached the relevant clauses of the Act and relevant section of the rule under which the MC is authorised to charge the annual amount. We are quite hopeful the UT will positively consider this plea,” a senior official said. Sources in the MC said a detailed discussion has also been held in the past. “The MC had also discussed the matter at the higher level with the administration. It had even reached former Punjab governor and UT administrator V P Singh Badnore and the UT had agreed to it in-principle. But after that nothing happened. In the MC’s budget, this segment was also approved by the UT and therefore, it makes our case strong,” sources said. While passing its annual budget in January, the finance and contract committee had asked the officers to take up the matter with the UT. Works halted:Since the MC has been passing through a financial crunch, it is eyeing every segment to increase its revenue resources. Due to the paucity of finances, many works have already come to a halt and only those for which the MC has received the dedicated financial assistance from the Chandigarh administration are under way.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/chandigarh-let-us-charge-rs-26-crore-power-duty-says-civic-body-to-administration/articleshow/86109269.cms||Deepak Yadav

The trio also hit the couple’s car twice and allegedly tried to run over her husband when he got off to confront them. Two of the youths have been arrested. One of them is the son of a sub-divisional magistrate in UP. Richa Sharma, the anchor working with a news channel, told police that the alleged road rage happened around 9pm in the Sector 99 area on Thursday. “We were travelling from my office in Film City to our housing society in Sector 77 when we spotted the Creta that was parked in the middle of the road. Three youths, including a woman, were seated in the SUV. And they were all drunk.” When Richa gave a dipper to the youths signalling them to give way, the trio allegedly hurled abuses at her. “They started misbehaving with us and even threatened to kidnap me. Then they started following us and hit our car from behind. The second time the trio crashed the Creta into our car after taking a U-turn to come from the wrong side. The trio also tried to run over my husband when he got off,” the complainant read. Richa’s husband Sarthak Ajay Bhargava told TOI that he has suffered a fracture in the leg due to the incident. “We have a video of the road rage in our possession and have shared it with the police,” he said. The youths have been identified as Abhinav Srivastava (23) and Sanyam Jain (22), who are both MBA students. Sarthak said that the woman in the SUV was also drunk at the time of the incident.

---||Bhopal||Ganesh festival: Home celebration for second year in Bhopal||BHOPAL: Late permission received from the district administration for public celebration of Ganesh festival coupled with wet weather over the past few days has led to installation of Lord Ganesh at far fewer places than usual. On Ganesh Chaturthi, Lord Ganesh is installed in the city at over 600 places, but this year the public celebration could be seen at far less places. The festive atmosphere was more palpable in households and housing societies, where small idols of Lord Ganesh have been installed in thousands. At several places, installation of Lord Ganesh’s idol had not taken place till late evening as the organisers were busy putting everything in order before the Lord could be seated in the pandal. “We received the permission late and then it has been raining for the past few days, so we could not prepare everything in advance. We are still putting things in order before the idol of Lord Ganesh is installed with an elaborate puja and accompanying rituals’’, said secretary of the New Market Vyapari Mahasangh Ajay Devanani. He said that by 8 pm, the idol would be installed and the pandal would be ready for devotees to come and have darshan of the Lord Ganesh. He, however, said that on the first day, people install Lord Ganesh at home and do their own puja and rituals rather than going for darshan of Lord Ganesh installed at public places like New Market. “It’s the second day, when people start coming to have darshan”, he said. Students of Gandhi Medical College celebrate at their hostel on Hamidia hospital campusDevanani said that they would request people to leave after having darshan of the Lord and receiving prasad so that there is no crowding in the pandal and not more than 10-12 people are there in the pandal at a time. Lord Ganesh at Sarafa Chowk, known as “Bhopal Ke Raja” was, however, installed with puja and accompanying rituals spanning over three hours during the day itself. Here, Lord Ganesh is seated in the pandal with his entire family — Lord Ganesh, Riddhi, Siddhi, Subh & Labh. Dinesh Goyal of the organising committee said that it’s more of offering prayer to the Lord with “Vidhi Vidhan” (rites and rituals) here at Sarafa Chowk. “Idols were installed during the day with an elaborate puja spanning over three hours and in the evening, there will be “shringar” of the Lord and other members of his family with flowers. On crowd management, he said, “There is always a crowd at Sarafa Chowk but we have decided not to distribute prasad to devotees following puja, so that there is no crowding in the pandal. As far as puja is concerned, it is done by the pujari in the presence of two organising committee members so there is no question of crowd assembling for puja”, he said. It seemed clear from what the organisers are saying that there will be no extravaganza during the festival and the festivities will mainly be limited to “darshan, puja and Shringar” of the Lord.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/ganesh-festival-home-celebration-for-second-year-in-bhopal/articleshow/86109278.cms||Ashutosh Shukla
---||Chandigarh||Chandigarh: Retch-&-hug tactic leads to gold bangles theft in sector 44||CHANDIGARH: Thieves on wheels struck again. Once more their victim was a morning walker. The ruse was almost the same, with a slight improvisation. Ten days after a Behlana woman got a hug and a lift in a car to her home only to realise her gold bangle missing, Sector 44 resident Sobha Sethi underwent the same experience, minus the ride. The 66-year-old was taking a walk with her cousin near her house when a white-colour car stopped next to them. Three women were sitting on the rear seat and a man was behind the wheel. One of the women got down. She pretended to vomit, making others call Sethi for help. As she and her cousin came forward, the second woman hugged Sethi claiming to know her well. Before Sethi could make out what was happening, the two women sat in the car and all of them sped away. After a few seconds, Sethi realised her two gold bangles (2.5 tola) were missing from her hands. She informed the police and her family members. Sector 34 police SHO and other cops reached the site. They recorded the statement of Sethi and launched a search operation to no avail. Police registered a case under relevant sections of the IPC. Cops said these accused use metal cutters to steal bangles and gold chains. Sector 11 police had arrested a gang of thieves comprising women from Punjab in 2018. They used to cut jewellery worn by women while boarding buses at a PGI bus stop. Rs 20,000 stolen in bank, alleges woman:A woman allegedly lost a purse to a thief at a branch of Punjab National Bank (PNB) in Sector 20. Poonam came from her home in Sector 38 at 12.30 pm. She said she had kept the cash — Rs 20,000 — in a small purse in her handbag. She parked her Honda Activa scooter in the paid parking lot, took a slip and walked into the bank. She said she tried to deposit the money through a cash deposit machine but a technical glitch did not allow it. She filled a deposit form. When Poonam reached the cash deposit counter, she said the small purse was not in her handbag. She called up her husband and the police. Cops from Sector 19 police station checked the CCTV footage but did not find any clue on how the alleged theft occurred. The woman claimed the cash was in her bag when she paid for the parking and tried to deposit the money through the machine. Bikers snatch bag containing Rs 50,000:Two motorcycle-borne youths snatched a bag containing Rs 50,000 from a woman in Naraingarh town of Ambala district on Thursday. On the complaint of Lovepreet Singh of Laha village in Naraingarh block, the Ambala police registered a case against unknown persons under Section 379-A (punishment for snatching) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at Naraingarh police station. Lovepreet told police that he along with his mother had come to withdraw money from Punjab National Bank at Naraingarh. “My mother kept Rs 50,000 in her bag. At 11.40 am, we left on our motorcycle for some work towards Panjlasa Chowk. At 11.45 am when we reached in front of UCO Bank at Ambala Chowk, two motorcycle-borne youths came from behind, snatched the bag and and fled towards Shahzadpur,” he alleged.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/chandigarh-retch-hug-tactic-leads-to-gold-bangles-theft-in-sector-44/articleshow/86109320.cms||Pawan Tiwari

The city is now home to around 33% of the total active Covid-19 patients in the state as on date. Taking strict measures, district administration has issued orders under section 144 and had also stopped the home isolation of the patients, barring only those rare cases of patients who have satisfactory arrangements at home, no home isolation of the patients is now allowed in the district. District collector Jabalpur, Karamveer Sharma said, “Between September 1 and September 8, a total of 46 new Covid-19 cases were reported in the district and on September 9, no new case was found. And as on date there are around 47 active patients in Jabalpur.” Sources said that as on September 9, there were a total of 137 active patients in the entire state.“District administration is alert in the eye of the suspected third wave of Covid-19. We have started random sampling at several places. Random samples of the people coming from outside is also being done at railway stations and bus stands.

Of the total cases, there is only one case of a minor child,” he said. Meanwhile chief medical and health officer, Dr Ratnesh Kuraria said, “There is nothing as any specific location where these new Covid-19 patients have been found.

The youth’s throat was slit. Incident took place in the Ashoka Garden area on Thursday night. Police claim that an old enmity that started over social media post is said to be the cause of the crime. Ashoka Garden SHO Alok Shrivastava said that the deceased Ayush resided with his parents near Nehru School, Ashoka Garden. He was a student of class 12 and his father works at the state agriculture department. Shrivastava said that on Thursday around 10.20 pm Ayush went out for to get Ganesh idol along with his friends when accused Kunal, Rohit, Brijesh and Mayur alias Danny waylaid him near a sweet shop in Ashoka Garden. Before any of his friends could realise, accused Kunal(19) took out a knife from his pocket and attacked Ayush on his throat. “The accused slit his throat two times after which the victim collapsed on the ground. All the accused managed to flee the spot. Victim’s friends rushed him to a nearby private hospital where doctors referred him to Hamidia hospital, where he died during treatment. Shrivastava said that during investigation it came to light that Ayush and Kunal were friends around one and a half years back, but due to a social media post a dispute took place between them and the friendship fell apart.

---||Noida||NHAI places guards to curb wrong-side driving on DME||Ghaziabad: The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has identified several spots on the Delhi-Meerut Expressway where wrong-side driving is rampant and placed guards to curb the menace. The move comes days after five persons of a family, including a one-year-old toddler, were killed after a truck being driven on the wrong side hit their car near Masuri in Ghaziabad. According to an estimate by NHAI, the DME, the country’s widest expressway, has seen at least 25 accidents since March this year. In total, 12-15 guards would be stationed at the identified spots along the 80km expressway and ensure that vehicles stick to their carriageways. “Between Sarai Kale Khan and UP Gate, we have identified four spots where wrong-side driving is rampant. Similarly, on the stretch between UP Gate and Dasna, four more spots are notorious for wrong-lane driving. On the Dasna to Meerut section, there are three such spots,” said Mudit Garg, the project director of NHAI. The spots identified on the Sarai Kale Khan-UP Gate section are the turns near Akshardham temple, Mayur Vihar, Ghazipur market and the MCD toll plaza. “Four guards have been deployed at these spots. They will work in shifts and ensure that wrong-side driving is checked,” Garg said. Between UP Gate and Dasna, guards will be stationed near the CISF cut, Model Town, Bamheta and the Dasna cut. On the Dasna to Meerut stretch, similar arrangements will be made at the Dasna junction, Bhojpur and Partapur. “There will be five guards stationed between UP Gate and Dasna and four on the third stretch. They will man the areas 24 hours, but in shifts. But it is not the NHAI’s responsibility to manage traffic on the DME. It is for the traffic departments of Delhi, Noida, Ghaziabad and Meerut to ensure vehicles follow the rules. Without the police’s help, it is unlikely that wrong-side driving would be stopped completely,” he said. The DME is an access-controlled expressway and doesn’t allow bikers, three-wheelers, tractors and bullock carts. But it is hardly unknown to commuters on the stretch that all these vehicles have a free run on the speedway. “There is a reason why these vehicles are not allowed on the DME. The speed limit on the expressway is 100kmph in UP and 70kmph in Delhi. This means vehicles move at a very high speed here. But those that move at a relatively slow speed have made the stretch accident-prone,” said Garg. Much of the DME had been out of bounds during the height of the farmers’ protest. Tractors would widely move around the expressway, throwing traffic rules to the wind. “Ever since the farmer agitation started last year, tractors can be frequently seen on the expressway,” Garg said. But it’s not just vehicles that are the cause for concern. Jaywalking has compounded the problem, especially in areas such as Noida Sector 62, Model Town and Dasna. The traffic police in Ghaziabad claimed cops had been deployed at various spots and violators were being fined regularly. “In the last couple of days, we have issued more than 100 challans for traffic violations on the DME. We have also seized 17 auto-rickshaws. Such drives will continue. On our part, we will ensure that traffic violations don’t take place on the expressway,” said Ramanand Kushwaha, the SP (traffic).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/nhai-places-guards-to-curb-wrong-side-driving-on-dme/articleshow/86101650.cms||Abhijay Jha

Ghaziabad has reported 72 dengue cases so far this year and eight of those were detected on Friday itself. In Noida, although the health department has not recorded a single dengue case this year, according to doctors at the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS), Greater Noida, at least two dengue patients have been to the hospital recently. Staffmembers at several private laboratories and hospitals, who did not wish to be identified, also said they have had dengue cases and some patients also needed hospitalisation. “We are getting several patients with fever almost daily. Recently, we have seen a few malaria cases and at least two dengue patients as well. Since these are recent incidents, the official report may not have been updated yet,” said brigadier (retired) Dr Rakesh Gupta, director, GIMS. Officials said Ghaziabad had cross-notified two cases to Noida recently but they are being looked into. “We got information from Ghaziabad about two patients being admitted to Yashoda and Columbia Asia hospitals there. But we are investigating it and that is why we have not confirmed the two cases yet. We have not got any reports from private hospitals so far,” said Rajesh Sharma, district malaria officer, Gautam Budh Nagar. All private facilities have to inform the health department and send samples for confirmation in case of notified diseases, including dengue, malaria and scrub typhus. In Noida, some residents have claimed that they have dengue patients in their sectors and their tests were conducted at private laboratories. At least two such cases are said to be in Sector 137 and two in Sector 75. “The health department has to take appropriate measures in these areas,” said Abhisht Gupta from Sector 137. In Ghaziabad, the latest dengue cases were reported from Pratap Vihar, Cheeranjeevi Vihar, Govindpuram, Nandgram and Dasna. The administration has directed civic bodies and the health department to intensify anti-larvae drives and district magistrate RK Singh is monitoring the patients. District surveillance officer Dr RK Gupta said mapping of areas that have reported vector-borne diseases is being done. In Noida, 28 malaria cases have been recorded this year, which is higher than all of last year, and Ghaziabad has 10 cases so far. Officials in both districts said mandatory malaria tests are being conducted for all fever patients at government hospitals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/hosps-pvt-labs-say-dengue-cases-detected-but-noidas-tally-still-at-0/articleshow/86101664.cms||Snehil Sinha

The child was undergoing treatment at a private facility in Sihani and was taken to the emergency ward of MMG District hospital where doctors declared him dead. The child reportedly had pneumonia-like and nebulisers had been administered on him. District surveillance officer Dr RK Gupta said: “The child named Anurag, who stayed in Noor Nagar, Sihani, died on Friday. Recently, his family came to the city from Azamgarh and soon after, the boy and his five-year-old sister got fever. While the girl recovered, Anurag’s condition did not improve. He was taken to a local doctor and then to a private hospital on Thursday. Later, the child was shifted to the district hospital. The boy’s parents have not reported fever or any other symptoms.” The health department has ruled out dengue, malaria and scrub typhus as the cause of death. “We spoke to the private hospital where the child was treated and found that he had pneumonia-like symptoms and nebulisers had been administered. But we have sent a malaria and a rapid response team to the locality to conduct anti-larvae drive,” Gupta said, adding that a detailed medical history of the child is being prepared. The child was taken to the district hospital around 12.30 pm on Friday. Senior medical officer Dr AK Vishwakarma declared the boy dead after an examination. “The child was brought dead. The boy’s father told us he was down with fever. We have alerted the health department,” he said. He added that the body was handed over to the family as the child’s father refused to get a post-mortem done.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/child-dies-after-5-days-of-fever-doctors-suspect-pneumonia/articleshow/86101683.cms||Aditya Dev
---||Noida||LB assault row escalates: 9th guard held, security agency files complaint||Noida: One more guard was arrested in connection with the assault on a 55-year-old resident of Lotus Boulevard earlier this week, taking the total number of arrests to nine in the case. The agency responsible for providing security at the housing society said it had also filed a police complaint against the resident, but the cops had not acted on it. A video widely circulated on social media shows a group of guards attacking SK Singh, a resident of Lotus Boulevard, with sticks following an argument over handing keys to the common junction box. But another video has come to the fore, showing Singh purportedly arguing with a guard and the security in-charge minutes before he is attacked. At one point, Singh even hurls the entry register twice on the table. Eight guards deployed in the housing society, including security in-charge Amaresh Rai, were arrested on Thursday for the attack on Singh. On Friday, the ninth guard, Aditya, was taken into police custody. Sandeep Singh, the regional manager of CISS-Bureau security agency, said the guards were not the only ones at fault. He also pointed out that the guards had only informed police. “When the resident first called on the landline, one of the guards greeted him with a good morning. But he hurled abuses at the guard and said he had been frantically calling the facility management. When the guard said he would talk to his senior, the resident said he was coming down,” Sandeep Singh said. According to him, Singh not only abused the guards after coming down but also slapped one of them when he allegedly refused to hand over the key to the common junction box without the management’s permission. Sandeep Singh, however, agreed the guards “should not have taken law into their hands”. “The guards were not the only ones at fault. There was strict instruction that the keys should not be given to anyone without permission,” he added. The security agency manager said they had tried to lodge a complaint at the Sector 39 police station on two occasions earlier, but it was not accepted. Additional DCP (Noida) Ranvijay Singh said, “The complaint from the agency would be incorporated as evidence in the investigation of the previous FIR lodged by the resident.” Singh, however, said he got aggressive because the facility management hadn’t replied to any of his mails and messages or responded to calls. “I had taken the keys from the guard the previous day. But on the second day, he asked me to take permission. There were technicians at my house to fix the WiFi connection and I needed the keys urgently. I was told by the facility management later that I did not need permission,” he added. Noida police, meanwhile, have written to the ADG (law and order), recommending cancellation of the security agency’s licence. Additional commissioner of police (law and order) Love Kumar said the letter had been sent to the state government. On Friday, the UP chapter of the central association of private security agencies held a meeting on the issue. NP Singh, president of the association, agreed that guards had made a mistake by attacking the resident, but said it needed to be examined under what circumstances that assault took place.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/noida/lb-assault-row-escalates-9th-guard-held-security-agency-files-complaint/articleshow/86101716.cms||Shikha Salaria

An FIR was lodged under the charges of rape and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 against the headmaster. Sources in the police said that the headmaster had in the past also committed such an act with the school girls, but due to societal stigma they did not complain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/uttar-pradesh-headmaster-arrested-for-raping-class-4-girl-in-sitapur/articleshow/86109693.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Colleges in Kolkata struggle to fill UG seats||KOLKATA: Ten days after admission to undergraduate courses in colleges commenced, seats in many courses in several colleges remain empty, a cause for worry for hundreds of students who have scored over 90% in board results but are yet to get a seat in a subject and college of choice. Principals fear some seats may remain vacant even in high-demand courses despite the huge number of applicants due to their inability to reclaim the seats of students who opt for a second college after taking admission in one. This year, colleges have received a record number of applications. With no application fee, some students have applied to as many as 20 colleges. The top scorers figured in the first list of multiple colleges with some even taking admission in more than one. With no system to ensure that the previous seat will be vacated once a student takes admission in another college, it remains a challenge. Surendranath College, for instance, received 54,000 application forms but only 10% seats have been filled up till date. College principal Indranil Kar pointed out that every year, nearly 30% seats remained vacant due to their inability to weed out those students who have also taken admission elsewhere and don’t report to the college when classes commence. To solve the problem, many colleges have introduced a wish list format that allows interested students to gain admission. Many principals of city colleges felt a central counselling system could be a solution. “Colleges do face a challenge in identifying students who have taken admission but then don’t attend classes because they’ve taken admission elsewhere as well. At present, students are not bound to inform colleges that they have taken admission elsewhere,” said New Alipore College principal Jaydeep Sarangi. A principal of a central Kolkata college reasoned that a central counselling system could eliminate the problem of multiple admissions by a single candidate through use of a dedicated portal to monitor the admission process. A few years ago during his first stint in the education department, minister Bratya Basu had proposed a centralised counselling system but it had ultimately not been implemented. A section of principals now feel it may be time to revisit the proposal. There is a counter argument against central counselling as well with some pointing out that it is not fool-proof. But even they admit that while top rung colleges will always be the first preference like counselling in Joint, it will be easier to know how many are opting out for upgradation if the process is monitored centrally.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/colleges-struggle-to-fill-ug-seats/articleshow/86100516.cms||---

---||Bhubaneswar||Odisha: Fake RT-PCR cert racket busted in Puri, 12 arrested||BHUBANESWAR: Police on Friday busted a syndicate involved in the sale of fake Covid RT-PCR negative reports to devotees in Puri for a hassle-free entry into the Jagannath Temple with 12 arrests. Puri SP Kanwar Vishal Singh said, “We have arrested 12 persons, including four devotees, in connection with the offence. While the four devotees belong to different states, the eight accused are from Puri. We appeal to the devotees to carry genuine vaccination or Covid negative certificates.” The government has made it mandatory for the devotees to either produce an RT-PCR negative report obtained 96 hours before the temple visit or a final vaccination certificate to offer prayers at the 12th century shrine. The police said the gang would target tourists, who were denied entry into the temple for not carrying either of the two mandatory documents. The accused would charge Rs 500 for each fake RT-PCR negative report. “We have sealed a computer shop where the accused would prepare the fake RT-PCR negative reports. They would collect the original Aadhaar cards of devotees and print fake RT-PCR reports instantly. We grew suspicious and started investigation after coming across a few fake RT-PCR negative reports recently,” Singh said. The police further said the names of some Covid testing laboratories and hospitals in Bhubaneswar and Puri were misused and printed in the fake RT-PCR negative reports. The police had sent the seized reports to the testing centres concerned during verification, following which they were found to be forged. “We have registered three cases — two with the Singhadwar police station and one with the Khumbharapada PS. We are likely to arrest some more persons soon. Owing to the sensitivity of the case, we have not disclosed the identities of the accused. We are trying to ascertain the exact number of fake reports sold by them so far,” Singh said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/fake-rt-pcr-cert-racket-busted-in-puri-12-arrested/articleshow/86107188.cms||Debabrata Mohapatra

Even as campaign for the by-election would officially start from September 20, the groundwork has already began. The bypoll was necessitated following the death of sitting BJD MLA Pradeep Maharathy. After the fresh schedule for the bypoll was announced, Rudra Pratap Maharathy (BJD), Ashrit Pattanayak (BJP) and Bishwokeshan Harichandan Mohapatra (Congress) have resumed their outreach programmes by visiting villages in the constituency. The BJD has started holding workers’ meetings at the grass-roots level. “Though we will officially start our campaign as per the schedule decided by the Election Commission of India, we have started zilla parishad level meetings with local leaders. We have prepared our strategy for the bypoll and we will follow that,” said a senior BJD functionary, in-charge of BJD’s Pipili bypoll. The party had earlier assigned over two dozen of MLAs including several ministers to oversee BJD’s campaign in the constituency and it could be repeated this time as well. Sources in the BJP and Congress said both the parties have also held initial discussion at the highest level to decide strategies for the bypoll. Both the parties have assigned senior leaders to campaign for their respective candidates. Amid Covid-19 restrictions, door-to-door meeting will be the focus of all three parties though rallies will be held with small gatherings. The poll panel has barred road shows, bike or cycle rallies during the campaign period in view of Covid-19.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/as-assembly-ends-parties-shift-focus-to-pipili-bypoll/articleshow/86106891.cms||Sujit Kumar Bisoyi

The system, now lying as a cyclonic circulation is likely to take shape of a low pressure over the central Bay of Bengal in the next 24 hours. Thereafter it is likely to move in the west north westwards direction and concentrate into a depression in the subsequent 48 hours, said a release from IMD. It said light rainfall would take place at most places with chances of heavy to extremely heavy rainfall at isolated places in select districts during the two days.  There would also be light to moderate rainfall at many places on Saturday due to the system, the forecast said. The IMD release said the possible system might support ongoing agriculture activity. But all the same it warned that heavy rainfall might cause temporary water logging in low- lying areas and traffic disruptions in urban areas. The government in the wake of heavy rainfall warning has asked district collectors to remain alert and suggested them to take needful steps depending upon the situation. The office of the special relief commissioner ( SRC) sent that advisory to the collectors. H R Biswas, director of IMD, regional centre, said the possible system is likely to intensify into a depression after causing widespread rainfall for two days and loose it’s intensity by Tuesday. IMD’s Friday rainfall report stated that Nuagada in Gajapati district recorded the highest of 64 mm rainfall in the state in the last 24 hours. Similarly, Nayagarh during the day recorded 24.3 mm rain. The overall seasonal rainfall deficit from June to till date by Friday stood at 27%. This is with 18 districts facing rainfall deficit and five of them the figure standing at 40% or more.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/low-pressure-to-trigger-rain-on-sunday-monday/articleshow/86106744.cms||---

Zoo Atlanta's animal handlers collected fecal samples and nasal and oral swabs from the gorillas and sent the samples to a diagnostic lab at the University of Georgia, which returned presumptive positive results for the virus that causes Covid-19, a Zoo Atlanta statement said. The zoo added that it was awaiting confirmation of the test results from the National Veterinary Services laboratory in Ames, Iowa, which also received samples. The statement didn't say how many of the gorillas appeared to be infected, but the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported 13 gorillas had tested positive for the virus. The zoo statement said its teams are collecting samples for testing from the zoo's entire gorilla population, which numbers 20 members living in four troops. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution report said members from each of the four troops showed evidence of infection. The newspaper report said it is likely that the virus made its way into the gorilla population from an animal care staffer who was asymptomatic upon coming to work, but who later tested positive for the virus.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/positive-virus-tests-among-gorilla-population-at-zoo-atlanta/articleshow/86109890.cms||---
---||Bhubaneswar||With test positivity rate below 1%, western Odisha goes into Nuakhai mood||BHUBANESWAR: For the first time in many months, the government has relaxed norms for a festival. On Saturday, Nuakhai will be celebrated in western Odisha. Last year, the agrarian festival, was a very low-key affair as the state was reeling under the second wave of the pandemic in September. This year, no religious or cultural gatherings will be allowed. But there is no restriction on people organising rituals and feasts in their homes. Currently, the test positivity rate (TPR) in all western Odisha districts is below 1%. Although, Nuapada is considered as the epicentre of the second wave because of its proximity to Raipur, the capital of Chhattisgarh, the district’s TPR stands at 0.17%. It had seven active cases till Friday, the lowest in the state. The shops are completely open for Nuakhai and people are shopping to their heart’s content. “The Nuakhai mood is much better this year,” said collector (Nuapada) Swadha Dev Singh. On Friday, 745 samples tested positive out of the 66,106 tested in the state. The western districts taken together reported only 48 new infections out of 745. Four districts — Balangir, Boudh, Kalahandi and Jharsuguda — did not report a single case.  Balangir, Kalahandi, Subarnapur and Nuapada on many days have not reported any case. en able to achieve even now. The western Odisha districts witnessed a surge between August and November in the first wave affecting celebration of Nuakhai and Durga Puja. This year, Balangir district has been testing 2,400 samples daily but only two to three cases are returning positive. Around 60% of the tests are being conducted through mobile facilities as teams stay parked at vantage locations to collect swab samples. Now, most of the urban centres in the western districts and rural pockets are witnessing nil cases. Collector (Sambalpur) Subham Saxena said the Nuakhai celebrations is more lively this time as people are out shopping as there is no restriction on opening of markets. “Since a minuscule number of new infections are being reported, there is no fear among people. However, Covid appropriate behaviour is being ensured in the markets by regulating the crowd,” he said. Khurda on Friday added 297 fresh cases while Bhubaneswar added 288 new infections against 171 recoveries. The number of active cases have again gone up to 3,332 in Bhubaneswar while there are 7, 078 active cases in the state.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/with-tpr-below-1-western-odisha-goes-into-nuakhai-mood/articleshow/86104480.cms||Riyan Ramanath V
---||Kochi||A drumroll they deserve||From the electrifying beats of Chenda and the soft tones of Idakka to the muscular strokes of the Madallam suspended on the hip of the artist to the distinctive metallic chimes of Ilathalam, few states can rival Kerala in having such a diverse and thriving indigenous percussion culture.  The beats of the myriad indigenous percussion instruments pervades every facet of popular life in the state from the crowded temple festivals and grandiose Kathakali performances to the more mundane election campaigns, marriages and even shop inaugurations. However, despite the percussion ensembles being so popular and immersive, the artists, barring a few celebrities, have remained an unsung lot and the rich percussion history of the state scantily documented. To bring about a change, a group of percussion artists under the Sopanam School of Panchavadhyam at Edappal in Malappuram has embarked on an ambitious project to showcase the comprehensive history of percussion arts in the state and more importantly to create a voluminous database of percussion artists spanning the last 400 years. The endeavour will help recognize thousands of artists who have drummed all through their lives but have remained unheard and unsung. Interestingly the Sopanam School of Panchavadyam set off on the mission when the Covid pandemic silenced their drums. "The Covid pandemic robbed us the festive seasons during the last one and a half years but using that time we have collected details of 9,100 percussion artists of the state dating back to the 1700s from the time of famous musician Shadkala Govinda Marar and will both include legendary artists as well as the uncelebrated for whom percussion was a means for livelihood as well. We have collected over 7,000 photographs of the artists," Santhosh Alankode, director of Sopanam school of Panchavadhyam, said. He said that gathering the details of percussion artists over many generations has been an arduous task with as many as six people, including him, involved in collecting details from 14 districts, checking with artists about their contemporaries and gurus and calling them up. He said that since many percussionists follow a family tradition, details about their ancestors could be collected from such families.  Also, they have scoured history and literary books to get info about noted percussionists of those times like the mention of Mundamballi Krishnan Marar in Aithihyamala by Kottarathil Sankunni. He said that the upcoming book which will also be an authoritative compendium of the history of percussion music in the state will include the technical aspects of the seven major percussion instruments, namely Chenda, Thimila, Maddalam, Edakka, Kombu, Ilathalam and Kurumkuzhal. “Though there have been scattered references to the percussion instruments dating back to the Vedas and the Natya Shastra, there is no detailed study on the history and development of various percussion art forms including the popular ensembles of the state like Thayambaka and Panchavadyam and various melams associated with temple music. For instance there is mention about an ensemble performance of Panchaghosham being held in the Sree Vallabha Temple at Thiruvalla over 1,000 years back which could be the precursor of Panchavadhyam for which we have a recorded history of over a century but could definitely would have been performed much before," he said. The book will also trace the evolution of instrumental percussion music; for instance, the Thayambaka which evolved from solo performances to double thayambaka and triple thayambaka which can have as many as 14 performers and even penta thayambaka having five lead artists. Santhosh added that the book is being planned as a two-volume compendium which will be brought out by early next year.  Master percussionists Mattannur Sankarankutty Marar and Kariyannur Narayanan Namboodiri are among those who are supporting the school in this ambitious task.  The book is being edited by Santhosh Alankode, who is a fourth-generation percussion artist, and Prakash Manjappra. Santhosh said that already Rs 14 lakh has been spent on the project which is expected to entail an expenditure of over Rs 25 lakh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/a-drumroll-they-deserve/articleshow/86109892.cms||K R Rajeev
---||Cuttack||Amid blame game over ‘suicide’, Cuttack cops to now probe man’s murder||BHUBANESWAR: Amid the opposition attack on ruling BJD over the alleged suicide of Dusmanta Das near the assembly on Wednesday, Mangalabag police in Cuttack took over investigation from their counterparts in Kujanga on Friday. Das had allegedly slit his wrists and consumed poison near the assembly in protest against the government’s alleged denial of free treatment to him under BSKY last year. The Kujanga police in Jagatsinghpur district had on Thursday registered a murder case after Das’s mother alleged that an unidentified man, who took her son to Bhubaneswar, might have killed him. In her complaint, Basanti Das alleged that the unidentified man might have slashed her son’s wrists and forced him to consume poison so that the drastic step would draw the government’s attention towards his plight regarding BSKY. Since Das succumbed during treatment at the SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack, the Kujanga police referred the case to Mangalabag police on jurisdictional ground. “Our investigation is in progress. The allegation of the deceased’s mother is being verified,” Cuttack deputy commissioner of police Prateek Singh said. The BJP on Friday continued to attack the government over the issue and demanded a CBI probe into the circumstances that led to Das’s death. The BJP said his alleged suicide exposed the shoddy healthcare system of the state government. “The government, which has all along been refusing to implement the Centre’s Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan Mantri Jan Aarogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY) in Odisha, now stands exposed following the denial of treatment to Das under Biju Swasthya Kalyan Yojana. We demand Rs 50 lakh compensation to the next of kin of the deceased, a government job for the deceased’s wife and CBI probe into his death,” senior BJP leader and former minister Manmohan Samal said on Friday. Manas Mangaraj, BJD general secretary (media affairs) said those seeking a CBI probe terming it a suicide should respond to allegation of Das’s mother who said he was murdered. “Police are probing the case. Let the police find out the people who brought Das (who could not walk because of injury after his accident) to Bhubaneswar and the sequence of events leading to his unfortunate death,” Mangaraj added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/cuttack/amid-blame-game-over-suicide-cuttack-cops-to-now-probe-mans-murder/articleshow/86110039.cms||Debabrata Mohapatra
---||World||Wyoming troop deaths 20 years apart bookend Afghanistan war||CHEYENNE: When news came that a 20-year-old Wyoming soldier was one of the last casualties of the two-decade-long U.S. war in Afghanistan, it arrived as a tragic bookend: A 20-year-old soldier from Wyoming was among the first to die in the same war. Army Ranger Spc. Jonn Edmunds, of Cheyenne, was one of the war's first two casualties when a Black Hawk helicopter on a search-and-rescue mission crashed in Pakistan on Oct. 19, 2001. Last month, the family of Marine Lance Cpl. Rylee McCollum, of Bondurant just outside Jackson, got word he was among 13 U.S. soldiers killed in a suicide bombing Aug. 26 at the Kabul airport. Edmunds and McCollum were both killed on their first deployments. In between, almost 2,500 U.S. troops died in the Afghanistan war, most with far less attention than the two Wyoming men got. As with Edmunds' death in the chaotic aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, McCollum's strikes an especially sad chord as Americans struggle to process what good _ if any _ has come from their nation's longest war. ``That was a totally senseless death,`` Edmunds' father, Donn Edmunds, said of McCollum. ``Seeing the other people losing their loved ones, all that does is bring back bad memories for my family.`` A 25-year U.S. Army veteran who served in Vietnam, Edmunds remembers how two officers knocked on his door on the outskirts of Cheyenne before sunrise on Oct. 20, 2001, bringing word of his son's death. ``I looked out the window, I saw them standing there and all I could think was `Oh my God, I know what they're here for.' I've done notifications so I knew,'' said Edmunds, who as a military police officer participated in telling relatives of loved ones' deaths. He got choked up and quiet while looking at a display of his son's medals and the folded American flag presented to him and other families of fallen soldiers. ``They came in and gave us the `Regret to inform you' speech. My wife had been up by then, and I watched her melt into this carpet right here on the floor,`` Edmunds recalled. ``And they asked, `Is there anything we can do?' and we said, `No, just let us absorb this, and we have to be able to accept this.''' Wyoming is the least populated state and one that values tradition: rodeo and county fairs in summer, elk hunting in fall, calving season in spring and military service. Jonn Edmunds and his friends grew up playing with water guns, then laser tag in the family's big yard. Eventually the honors student moved up to paintball, Donn Edmunds recalled. ``We used to have the guys from the Air Force come out here. And they'd knock on the door and say, `Can Jonn come out and play paintball with us?''' he said. On the opposite side of Cheyenne, F.E. Warren Air Force Base has overseen nuclear missiles in silos beneath the Wyoming, Colorado and Nebraska plains since the 1960s. Each July, the city hosts its massive Cheyenne Frontier Days rodeo festival but Cheyenne has always been a military town at heart. Like Edmunds, McCollum seemed born with soldiering in his blood. He grew up in the Jackson Hole area, a region of rugged, forested mountains and big-time outdoors culture on the other side of Wyoming from Cheyenne. Even as a toddler, McCollum played with toy rifles, pretending he was a soldier or hunter, relatives said. As a high school wrestler, he distinguished himself by training intensely. At school, in 2017, he and his father spoke out publicly when a multiple-choice quiz for a reading assignment facetiously offered ``shooting at Trump'' as an answer. On Friday, hundreds of people lined the streets of Jackson to honor McCollum as his remains returned home from Afghanistan. Many people drove from surrounding towns, some multiple hours away, to pay their respects, and law enforcement saluted as the hearse passed by. ``I wrestled with him all my life. He was a senior when I was a freshman,'' said Colter Dawson of Jackson. ``He died for our country. There's not that many people who get to make that kind of honorable sacrifice, and that's something this town and this country need to recognize more.'' Jackson, where McCollum graduated from high school, is a wealthy ski and summer tourism enclave near Grand Teton and Yellowstone national parks that many in Wyoming view as socioeconomically out of step and politically more moderate than the rest of the state. Yet the town of 10,000 has shown no less respect for veterans and military service, especially over the past 20 years, said Joseph Burke, commander of the local American Legion post. ``It was around 9/11 that people started to recognize veterans, the sacrifices they and their families really made,'' Burke said. ``We've got kids who go in the service from here all the time.'' McCollum's widow, Jiennah Crayton, is due to deliver a baby in a couple of weeks and the family plans a memorial service sometime after. Meanwhile, three online fundraising efforts have brought in over $900,000 for Crayton and the child's education. After Jonn Edmunds' death, television trucks lined up outside the family's home. Reporters gathered at their daughter's school, Donn Edmunds recalled, and the family lived like ``hermits'' for a few weeks. At a memorial service that filled a 4,500-seat gym, Jonn Edmunds' commanding officer remembered him as a gritty soldier who still had ``that intense look on his face'' even after other soldiers looked tired. Such crowds wouldn't always show up, however, at services for soldiers killed in Afghanistan and Iraq over the next two decades. ``Yeah, people got numb. But the families that were affected never got numb,'' Edmunds said. The Edmunds family received about $24,000 in donations which they gave away to causes including the Wounded Warrior Project, a charity for troops wounded since 2001, Edmunds said. He has spent the years since his son's death riding his Harley-Davidson with the Patriot Guard Riders, a biker group that helps maintain decorum at military funerals, running unsuccessfully for the Wyoming Legislature and trying to raise interest in establishing a veterans memorial park. Now he's thinking about suing the U.S. government over its withdrawal from Afghanistan, which he criticized as poorly organized. ``All of these people's sons were great. Every one of them was a traumatic loss for their family. And the thing about it is, what for?'' Edmunds said. ``We have abandoned their mission.'' The work of consoling and counseling grief-stricken relatives, however, was therapeutic both for him and for relatives, said Edmunds, 72, who runs a security business. A woman once asked at an event held by the Army's Survivor Outreach Services family support group whether losing a loved one ever got easier, Edmunds recalled. ``I said `Ma'am, it will never get easier. The only thing that will happen to you is time will separate you from the event,''' Edmunds said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/wyoming-troop-deaths-20-years-apart-bookend-afghanistan-war/articleshow/86109888.cms||---
---||World||The Taliban are telling us they haven’t changed at all||For weeks, the Taliban promised to unveil an “inclusive” government: one that would respect women’s rights, albeit within the confines of Shariah law; represent different ethnicities; and bar terrorist groups from Afghanistan. Then, on Tuesday, the Taliban announced the leadership of the caretaker government. It is all male and packed with veterans of the brutal Taliban regime of 1996 to 2001. The members are almost all Pashtun, the dominant ethnic group in the country. One is on the FBI’s most-wanted list, four spent more than a decade in the Guantánamo Bay prison and most have been sanctioned by the United Nations. If there was a message that the movement, born in Pakistan’s madrasas nearly three decades ago, wanted to communicate, it appeared to be: We have not changed. Read AlsoKey figures in the new Taliban governmentNEW DELHI: The Taliban on Tuesday evening announced the new government. Mullah Hasan Akhund will be the acting Prime Minister in the new government while Mullah Baradar will be his first deputy. Following are some of the key figures in the new government that will take charge in Kabul: MullahAfter the Taliban’s stunning takeover of Kabul last month — a triumphant end to its 20-year war with US and NATO forces — the mullahs apparently saw no need to risk the cohesiveness of their movement or dilute their vision of a seventh-century Islamic emirate by granting any concessions to international sensibilities. Afghanistan crisis live updatesThe Taliban seem to have calculated that the West’s wishful thinking and desire to move on from two decades of bloody conflict would be enough to win them global acceptance. Even after the announcement of the new government, Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain spoke of helping supposed moderate Taliban figures overcome “more retrograde elements.” This is a test for the West. If the people of Afghanistan are subjected once more to oppression, the Taliban must be made a pariah, starved of foreign aid and recognition. Otherwise, universal norms of human rights will mean nothing. Even with no troops or embassy in the country, there are diplomatic, economic and military options still open to the United States. Read AlsoAfghanistan's new 33-member Taliban government: Full listNEW DELHI: The Taliban on Tuesday formed their interim 'Islamic Emirate' government with 33 members, finally ending the speculation around a new government administration, days after their military victory against the US, which forced it to pull out its troops from Afghanistan. With establishedThe makeup of this new government should come as no surprise. In the weeks since the US-backed Afghan government was toppled, the United Nations has cited “harrowing and credible” reports of summary executions and other human rights abuses across the country. Journalists have been beaten and thrown into jail. Just before the caretaker government announcement, a women’s protest in Kabul was suppressed with whips, batons and gunfire. When the Taliban were last in power, their interpretation of Shariah law meant punishments meted out in sports stadiums before baying crowds. Women accused of adultery were shot dead; gay men were stoned to death. Girls were barred from school and women from working. The uncompromising fundamentalists in the new government indicate that there will be no kinder, gentler new Taliban. Read AlsoAfghanistan: Ground reality contradicts Taliban's claim on women rightsNEW DELHI: The Taliban on Tuesday announced a caretaker Cabinet, a day after it took total control over Afghanistan, claiming they have won the key battle for Panjshir Valley, the final resistance holdout. Their return to power has alarmed, many - especially women - are worried about what TalibanSheikh Haibatullah Akhundzada, the Taliban’s supreme leader, is an avid proponent of the suicide bomb. His own son blew himself up in Helmand Province in 2017. Mullah Mohammad Hassan, now the de facto acting prime minister, was foreign minister and then deputy prime minister in the last Taliban regime. Sirajuddin Haqqani, the acting minister of the interior, has a $10 million FBI bounty on his head and leads the Haqqani network, which is tied to al-Qaida and designated by the state department as a terrorist group. Mawlawi Muhammad Yaqoub, the acting defense minister, is the eldest son of the one-eyed Mullah Omar, the Taliban’s founding leader, who died in 2013. Four of the “Guantánamo Five,” who were freed by the Obama administration in exchange for the American captured soldier Bowe Bergdahl in 2014, have senior government positions. The fifth is a provincial governor. Read AlsoWomen should give birth, they can't be ministers: TalibanA Taliban spokesperson on Thursday said women should restrict themselves to giving birth only. He further stated that it is not necessary for women to be in the cabinet and women protesters can't represent all women in Afghanistan. The statement comes amid Taliban announcing an all-male interimTheir records speak for themselves. Mullah Mohammed Fazl, who spent 12 years at Guantánamo, will resume his former role as deputy defense minister. In 2001, he was behind a fake surrender at Qala Jangi that led to the death of a CIA officer, Mike Spann, America’s first casualty after the September 11 attacks. Mullah Fazl, who came of age during the mujahedeen jihad against the Soviets in the 1980s, commanded 10,000 Taliban and a substantial number of Qaida troops in 2001. His nickname, Mazloom, which means “meek” or “oppressed,” is grimly ironic. Both Mullah Fazl and Mullah Norullah Noori, the new minister of borders and tribal affairs, are believed to have orchestrated the massacre of thousands of minority Shiites when the Taliban were last in power. Abdul Haq Wasiq, the new intelligence chief, has been accused of being closely connected to al-Qaida. Mullah Khairullah Khairkhwa, now minister of information and culture, was described in a leaked US military document as “one of the major opium drug lords in Western Afghanistan” and as a Taliban envoy to Iranian-backed terrorist groups. Mohammad Nabi Omari, new Khost governor, is suspected to be a leader of the Haqqani network. Several years after their release, the Guantánamo Five joined the Taliban negotiating team in Qatar, outwitting the Trump administration to secure a deal amounting to capitulation by the United States. Today the Taliban are even closer to al-Qaida than they were in 2001, though they are currently weaker than before. Mr. Haqqani, Mr. Wasiq, Mr. Omari and Mullah Fazl are all said to have longstanding operational ties to the group behind the Sept. 11 attacks. There are some differences between today’s Taliban and yesterday’s. The group is much more technologically savvy, using social media, smartphones and WhatsApp to spread its message and orchestrate surrenders. And two decades of fighting American forces, being imprisoned by them and negotiating with American diplomats also have given the Taliban a deeper understanding of Western weaknesses. But the West must not mistake tactical flexibility for real change. Their idea of Islamic purity, rather than good governance, has always been the Taliban’s priority. They just defeated what they view as a corrupt and depraved America. Why would they choose this moment to embrace American values? But the Taliban aren’t ruling the same Afghanistan, either. Flawed though it was, the 20-year American occupation led to a whole generation of Afghans experiencing a measure of freedom and modernity. It is a societal transformation the Taliban will struggle to reverse. Without even majority support among Pashtuns — who make up some 42 percent of Afghans — the Taliban need to control a population of almost 40 million, which has nearly doubled since 2001 and in which Tajiks, Hazaras and Uzbeks predominate. An Afghan opposition to the Taliban should be supported by the West. Economic sanctions should be applied against the Taliban regime and carefully calibrated military action taken against terrorist groups inside Afghanistan. Back in 2001, Mullah Fazl promised a CIA officer at Qala Jangi that al-Qaida fighters under his command would surrender. “If this is fake, it will lead to your destruction,” the officer warned him. Mullah Fazl was lying, but, against all odds, he survived. The return to power two decades later of the mullah and so many other notorious figures is an ominous sign for what’s to come.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/the-taliban-are-telling-us-they-havent-changed-at-all/articleshow/86109986.cms||---

They saved their lives by jumping off the vehicle. It came to fore later that the said vehicle was not on finance from the company but from a private bank. The accused approached three youths who were on their vehicle and attacked them. They then allegedly forced them to accompany them to an undisclosed location. While one of the youths managed to flee, two others were abducted and being taken away when they jumped and saved their lives, they told police. After being arrested, the accused said that they were mistaken with the registration number and tried to talk to the youths but did not abduct them. On the complaint of the youths, a case of abduction was registered against the accused. Chandan Nagar police station in-charge Yogesh Tomar said that Nikhil Soni had gone to have breakfast with his friends Azan Khan and Ram Thakur on his uncle Sachin Soni’s vehicle and was returning home when they were held by the accused who came on different two wheelers and forcefully made them sit on their vehicles. Ram Thakur managed to flee from the spot but Nikhil and Azan were taken away. As the vehicles slowed down on speed breakers, they jumped off. They reached the police station along with their family members late on Thursday where a case was registered against the accused and further investigations were initiated. Tomar said that on their complaint, Rohit Gohar, Siddharth Sisodiya and Mohit were booked and arrested. They are recovery agents in a finance company and had joined a day ago in the company.

---||Kochi||Pandemic lessons: 'We need to look beyond clinical silos to value-based medicine'||By Dr K EllangovanHealthcare services have never been a subject of intense debates and deliberations as seen now than any time in the recent past. Covid-19 shook human conscience, deranged economies, disrupted life and exposed inadequacies in our healthcare system. Millions have perished across the globe, perhaps in the worst pandemic of the century. Is it just that we were caught unprepared? Or are there fundamental issues in scaling up our healthcare services at short notice? The reasons may be both. Our healthcare system just lacked the required resilience to withstand the virus onslaught. Human resources worked overtime, almost to the stage of collapse. The supply chain broke down exposing serious glitches in the industry-hospital supply lines. Countries across the globe suffered more or less, due to the mismatch of the healthcare system’s capacity with overwhelming patient turnout.  We have learnt lessons, bitter ones. There is an overwhelming demand for a relook at our healthcare system to understand its ability to manage pandemic situations.  The issues of scalability, accessibility and vulnerability are the focal points in the discussions. When public health initiatives fail at the periphery, hospital load increases. The pressure varies according to the disease load in the population and the transmission rate of the infection. A large turnout of patients deranges the care service in hospitals. Our views on hospitals vary with experiences we undergo. Sometimes, we are happy with the services we received and yet, at times we criticize them, due to adverse outcomes. Suspicion creeps into the doctor-patient relationship primarily due to huge asymmetry of information between them. Hospitals and doctors are increasingly facing compensation suits and criminal cases, and this has altered the doctor-patient equation leading to a drastic change in the way treatment is administered in many hospitals. Doctors resort to ‘defensive practice’, often ordering unnecessary investigations which ultimately inflates bills.  Any attempt to enforce accountability has met with resistance. Doctors defend their actions and resent external scrutiny. Hospitals with a good process of care seldom face such situations. Excellence in healthcare should address quality, cost and access---the three fundamental issues in healthcare.  Although public hospitals are deemed to deliver free service and medicines, in reality they do not. The need to use private diagnostic services and buy medicines on prescriptions creates a financial barrier in public hospitals for the poor.  The resistance to prescribe generic drugs adds up to medicine costs, and so do inappropriate use of antibiotics and the tendency to use newer branded molecules.  Unregulated pricing structure in private hospitals, in any case, has been a huge barrier for accessing services by the poor. Physicians argue that the appropriateness of care process constitutes quality. Therefore, quality cannot be assessed by patients, who are not in a position to evaluate the services as interested parties and further, due to the lack of subject knowledge.  On the other side, patients contend that their experience is subsumed in the quality of services.  Therefore, clinical outcomes combined with patient experience should define the quality of services. Thus, there is no common ground as to what constitutes quality in healthcare. So, most healthcare providers in the developed economies have embraced the practice of ‘evidence-based medicine’.  The clinical decisions are based on the evidence adduced through investigations and therefore are expected to be appropriate. Indeed, in a way this was mandated by the private payer of service to standardize the care process, eliminate medical errors and regulate the outflow of funds. Evidence-based medicine reiterates the physicians’ point of view in equating quality with the appropriateness of care but lacked the patients’ perspectives. Therefore, of late, the concept of evidence-based medicine is increasingly replaced by ‘value-based medicine’. It is essentially about the value that is created to the patients, in the course of the treatment process, and encompasses appropriateness of care, patient experience and the cost incurred for that experience.  It reflects the physicians’ and the patients’ perspectives. The need to embrace this approach became a necessity as part of achieving a patient's endorsement, an element that brings in a fair degree of accountability. Accountability is generally low in publicly-funded institutions. Even in private clinics where service is met through out-of-pocket expenditures, owing to poor regulations there is a wide variation in the quality of service.  However, building too much accountability is seen to drive the cost upwards, as demonstrated in some developed economies. Only if all hospitals develop a system approach to standardize the care process, define outcomes, measure the outcome, and publish them, not only will the credibility of the institution improve but even the resultant accumulation of new knowledge will certainly add to the quality of care. If the patients’ experience is factored in, the service rendered will be valued by the patient community, leading to high levels of acceptance. Is it quite relevant to understand to what extent the delivery of services in publicly-funded hospitals match the expectations of the patients, the government, and the payer? The answer to this question is dissatisfying and incites arguments and counter arguments. Indeed, most of us believe that public hospitals provide very basic healthcare service.  In the context of comorbidities forming the majority of caseloads in the population, an integrated medical service designed around the medical conditions is required. However, ground realities establish that healthcare services are provided from the ‘clinical silos’ created in the individual departments. Indeed, the care process is also fragmented and there is no process of care defined across the service departments. The counter argument to this narrative is that these hospitals are perpetually overloaded and physician services are over-stretched. This raises questions of whether there exists a need to design services in these hospitals around the medical conditions. Whether it will create greater focus on developing expertise on specific illness is something that the policy makers have to ponder over. (The writer is a senior bureaucrat.

---||World||US honours 9/11 dead on 20th anniversary of attacks||NEW YORK: America marks the 20th anniversary of 9/11 Saturday with solemn ceremonies given added poignancy by the recent chaotic withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan and return to power of the Taliban. Heart-wrenching commemorations will unfold at each of the three sites where 19 al-Qaida hijackers -- mostly from Saudi Arabia -- crashed packed airliners, striking the cultural, financial and political hearts of the United States and changing the world forever. The memorials come with US troops finally gone from Afghanistan, but national discord -- and for President Joe Biden, political peril -- are overshadowing any sense of closure. In a video posted on the eve of the anniversary, Biden urged Americans to show unity, "our greatest strength." "To me, that's the central lesson of September 11th. It's that at our most vulnerable, in the push and pull of all that makes us human, in the battle for the soul of America, unity is our greatest strength," Biden said in a six- minute message from the White House. At New York's Ground Zero, where two pools of water now stand where the Twin Towers used to, relatives will read out the names of the nearly 3,000 people killed, in a four-hour-long service starting at 8:30 am (1230 GMT). Six moments of silence will be observed, corresponding with the times the two World Trade Center towers were struck, and fell, and the moments the Pentagon was attacked and Flight 93 crashed. Monica Iken-Murphy, who lost her 37-year-old husband Michael Iken in the World Trade Center, says this will be a "heightened" anniversary for many Americans. But for her, as for many other survivors, the pain has never wavered. "I feel like it just happened," she told AFP. A whole generation has grown up since the morning of September 11, 2001. In the interim, Al-Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden has been hunted down and killed. A towering new sky scraper has risen over Manhattan, replacing the Twin Towers. And less than two weeks ago, the last US soldiers flew from Kabul airport, ending the so-called "forever war." But the Taliban who once sheltered bin Laden are back ruling Afghanistan, the mighty US military humiliated. In Guantanamo Bay, accused 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four other men continue to await trial, nine years after charges were filed. Even the full story of how the attack came to happen remains secret. Only last week did Biden order the release of classified documents from the FBI investigation over the next six months. At Ground Zero, 2,753 people, from all over the world, were killed in the initial explosions, jumped to their deaths, or simply vanished in the inferno of the collapsing towers. At the Pentagon, an airliner tore a fiery hole in the side of the superpower's military nerve center, killing 184 people in the plane and on the ground. And in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, the third wave of hijackers crashed into a field after passengers fought back, sending United 93 down before reaching its intended target -- likely the US Capitol building in Washington. Biden and First Lady Jill Biden will stop at each of these places on Saturday to "honor and memorialize the lives lost," the White House said. In his video address Friday night, Biden urged Americans to come together as they reflect on the tragedy. "Unity doesn't mean we have to believe the same thing, but we must have a fundamental respect and faith in each other and in this nation," Biden said. The president had planned for this to be a pivotal day in his nearly eight-month-old presidency. However, instead of presiding over a moment of unity, Biden will traverse a country angry about the messy Kabul evacuation, which included 13 US soldiers killed by a suicide bomber, and stung by the broader realization of failure and defeat. For the relatives of victims, the anniversary, as always, is about keeping the memory of their loved ones alive. "It's like Pearl Harbor," said Frank Siller, whose firefighter brother Stephen died at the World Trade Center. "People who weren't alive don't have the same feeling about it as those who were alive. But America has never forgotten about Pearl Harbour and America will never forget about 9/11."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-honours-9/11-dead-on-20th-anniversary-of-attacks/articleshow/86110097.cms||---
---||Bhubaneswar||Odisha: Poor research output turns out to be Utkal University’s undoing||BHUBANESWAR: The CAG report tabled in the assembly and the NIRF rankings released on Friday point to poor research output at Utkal University. The state’s premier university got only 13.78 marks out of 100 in research and professional practice, which is the reason behind it managing 87th rank overall. Four other institutions from the state, including two private universities, have found a place in NIRF’s top-100 list. The CAG report stated that only one patent was filed by the university between 2014 and 2019. It was done in 2017-18, but had not been granted till the time of audit. As regards consultancies, Utkal University had received Rs 71.74 lakh as receipts for four consultancy projects between 2014-19, read the CAG report. Educationists said the university seriously needs motivation to strengthen its research ecosystem. Asoka Kumar Das, vice-chairman of Odisha State Higher Education Council and former vice-chancellor of the university, said, “All stakeholders should work together to strengthen the research ecosystem. We have started work in this direction. Hopefully, the goal will be achieved,” Das said. Siba Prasad Adhikary, former VC of FM University and former professor of Utkal University, said, “Out of 257 sanctioned posts, 126 are lying vacant in Utkal University. If you do not have half of your faculty posts, how can you think about research?” Adhikary asked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/poor-research-output-turns-out-to-be-utkal-univs-undoing/articleshow/86106897.cms||Hemanta Pradhan
---||World||Video shows last US Afghan strike may have targeted aid worker: Report||WASHINGTON: A video analysis shows the United States may have mistakenly targeted an aid worker rather than Islamic State fighters in its final strike in Afghanistan which killed 10 civilians, The New York Times said Friday. The Pentagon has said it disrupted a new attack planned by the Islamic State extremist group through a Reaper drone strike on August 29 -- the day before US troops ended their 20-year mission and following a devastating attack outside the airport where vast crowds rushed to leave the victorious Taliban. But Kabul resident Aimal Ahmadi earlier told AFP that the strike killed 10 civilians including his small daughter, nephews, nieces and his brother Ezmarai Ahmadi, who was driving the car that was struck after he parked. The New York Times, analyzing security camera footage, said the US military may have been seeing the slain Ahmadi and a colleague loading canisters of water, which was in short supply after the collapse of the Western-backed government, and picking up a laptop for his boss. Ezmarai Ahmadi was an electrical engineer for the California-based aid and lobbying group Nutrition and Education International and himself was among thousands of Afghans who had applied for resettlement in the United States, relatives said. US officials say that a larger blast took place after the drone strike, showing that there were explosives in the vehicle. But the New York Times investigation said there was no evidence of a second explosion, with only one dent on a nearby gate and no clear signs of an additional blast such as blown-out walls. Aimal Ahmadi earlier told AFP that 10 civilians were killed. US officials have acknowledged three civilian deaths but argued that the hit prevented another deadly attack. Commenting on the report, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said that US Central Command "continues to assess" the strike but that "no other military works harder than we do to prevent civilian casualties." "As Chairman (Mark) Milley said, the strike was based on good intelligence, and we still believe that it prevented an imminent threat to the airport and to our men and women that were still serving at the airport," Kirby said, referring to the top US general. The New York Times noted that a rocket attack the following morning, claimed by the Islamic State group, was carried out from a Toyota Corolla similar to Ahmadi's. More than 71,000 Afghan and Pakistani civilians have died directly from the war launched by the United States after the September 11, 2001 attacks, with casualties rising dramatically after then president Donald Trump relaxed rules of engagement in 2017, according to a Brown University study in April.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/video-shows-last-us-afghan-strike-may-have-targeted-aid-worker-report/articleshow/86110182.cms||---

Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) is working on the Patna Metro project, which is aimed at decongesting the city using a mass rapid transit network for the first time. “We have received an overwhelming response of over 7,500 entries from across the country. This includes big metros like Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bangalore, and also small cities like Guwahati, besides Patna. So, people have shown great interest,” a senior PMRC official told PTI. PMRC is the managing authority of the Patna Metro, and the principal secretary of the state government’s urban development and housing department holds the charge of the managing director of the corporation. The entries are being evaluated by a five-member jury and the final decision is expected to be taken on the PMRC logo by September end, the official said. There was no age bar on sending entries. A concept note too was to be attached with the entry, as per the contest specifications. “Out of about 7,500 entries, nearly 2,500 are from Bihar, with Patna accounting for close to 2,000 entries. All the big educational institutions are located in Patna, from across disciplines, so this huge response,” the official said. Patna entries have come from IIT, BIT, NIT, Patna University and its colleges, NIFT, and even schoolchildren have sent designed logos as part of the competition which ended on July 23. “We had invited entries as part of a pan-India contest from July 8 onwards. The first prize entails a prize money of Rs 50,000 while those whose designs will finish on second and third positions, will walk away with Rs 25,000 and Rs 11,000, respectively,” the official said. The PMRC, while announcing the contest, had underlined that contestants should “design a logo which will not only represent Patna, but also the urban transport revolution that will be brought to the city in the near future”. The jury consists of PMRC chief, senior officials of the Patna Metro, and experts from NIFT-Patna and Patna College of Arts and Crafts, the official said. The winner will be selected on the basis of creativity, originality, technical quality, creative ability and visual impact. Also, a factor will be, how well the vision of the PMRC has been depicted in the logo, the official said. “We have received entries which have been fully digitally designed, as also hand-drawn illustrations. The jury will take the call on the entries, and it will be then finally decided by the PMRC MD,” the official said. “The response was so massive and unexpected that PMRC servers were overburdened suddenly, crashing at times, due to huge volume of data flow, and storage size of email account got exhausted, so more space had to be bought online, he said.

---||World||Joe Biden's vaccine rules to set off barrage of legal challenges||WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden's sweeping new vaccine requirements have Republican governors threatening lawsuits. His unapologetic response, "Have at it." The administration is gearing up for another major clash between federal and state rule. But while many details about the rules remain unknown, Biden appears to be on firm legal ground to issue the directive in the name of protecting employee safety, according to several experts interviewed by The Associated Press. "My bet is that with respect to that statutory authority, they're on pretty strong footing given the evidence strongly suggesting the degree of risk that (unvaccinated individuals) pose, not only to themselves but also unto others," said University of Connecticut law professor Sachin Pandya. Republicans swiftly denounced the mandate that could impact 100 million Americans as government overreach and vowed to sue, and private employers who resist the requirements may do so as well. Texas governor Greg Abbott called it an "assault on private businesses" while governor Henry McMaster promised to "fight them to the gates of hell to protect the liberty and livelihood of every South Carolinian." The Republican national committee has also said it will sue the administration "to protect Americans and their liberties." Such cases could present another clash between state and federal authority at a time when Biden's justice department is already suing Texas over its new state law that bans most abortions, arguing that it was enacted "in open defiance of the Constitution." The White House is gearing up for legal challenges and believes that even if some of the mandates are tossed out, millions of Americans will get a shot because of the new requirements - saving lives and preventing the spread of the virus. Biden is putting enforcement in the hands of the occupational safety and health administration, which is drafting a rule "over the coming weeks," Jeffrey Zients, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, said on Friday. He warned that "if a workplace refuses to follow the standard, the OSHA fines could be quite significant." Courts have upheld vaccination requirements as a condition of employment, both before the pandemic - in challenges brought by health care workers - and since the coronavirus outbreak, said Lindsay Wiley, director of the Health Law and Policy Program at American University Washington College of Law. Where Biden's vaccine requirements could be more open to attack is over questions of whether the administration followed the proper process to implement them, she said. "The argument that mandatory vaccination impermissibly infringes on bodily autonomy or medical decision making, those arguments have not been successful and I don't expect that to change," Wiley said. "I think the challenges that are harder to predict the outcome of are going to be the ones that are really sort of the boring challenges about whether they followed the right process." Emergency temporary standards - under which the rules are being implemented on a fast track - have been particularly vulnerable to challenges, Wiley said. But the risks presented by the coronavirus and the existence of a declared public health emergency could put this one "on stronger footing than any other ones past administrations have tried to impose that have been challenged in court," she said. Indeed, the question of whether the mandate is legally sound is separate from whether it will be upheld by judges, including by a conservative-majority Supreme Court which has trended toward generous interpretations of religious freedom and may be looking to ensure that any mandate sufficiently takes faith-based objections into account. Vaccination "has become politicized and there are many Republican district judges who might be hostile to the regulation for political reasons," said Michael Harper, a Boston University law professor. "I could imagine an unfortunate opinion that attempted to justify this political stance by rejecting the use of OSHA against infectious disease rather than against hazards intrinsic to the workplace," Harper wrote in an email. The expansive rules mandate that all employers with more than 100 workers require them to be vaccinated or test for the virus weekly, affecting about 80 million Americans. And the roughly 17 million workers at health facilities that receive federal Medicare or Medicaid also will have to be fully vaccinated. Biden is also requiring vaccination for employees of the executive branch and contractors who do business with the federal government - with no option to test out. That covers several million more workers. Republican-dominated Montana stands alone in having a state law on the books that directly contradicts the new federal mandate. The state passed a law earlier this year making it illegal for private employers to require vaccines as a condition for employment. But University of Montana constitutional law professor Anthony Johnstone said the federal rules would trump the state law. That means larger Montana businesses that previously couldn't require their employees to get vaccinated will now likely be required to, including hospitals that are some of the largest employers in the sparsely populated state. Given that the rules are still being drafted and haven't been released, experts say the devil is in the details. It remains to be seen exactly what the rule will require employers to do or not do, and how it accounts for things such as other rights that unvaccinated employees may assert, such as the right to a disability accommodation, Pandya said. For example - with the growing number of fully remote businesses and workers - if the rules are written to include people who don't have workplace exposure, "there certainly is room for an issue there," said Erika Todd, an employment attorney with Sullivan and Worcester in Boston. Charles Craver, a labor and employment law professor at George Washington University, said the mandate presented a "close question" legally. But he said the Biden administration did have a legitimate argument that such a requirement was necessary for employers to protect the safety of workers, customers and members of the public. The thornier question, though, is how employers - and courts - will sort through requests for accommodations for employees on religious or other grounds. Though such accommodations may include having an employee work from home, "you can have a situation where someone has to be present and you can't provide an accommodation because of the danger involved," he added. "I would not be a betting person if this went up before the Supreme Court," Craver said. "I could even picture the court divided 5-4, and I wouldn't bet which way it would go."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/joe-bidens-vaccine-rules-to-set-off-barrage-of-legal-challenges/articleshow/86110368.cms||---

Parents of the girl, who reside in the Indiranagar, lodged a complaint with the police in this connection and the police have launched a manhunt for the accused. The victim’s father in his complaint stated that on August 30 midnight an unidentified man made a call to his daughter and started talking lewdly with her. She immediately switched off the phone and told the incident to them the next morning, he said, adding that initially he ignored the call, taking it lightly. “However, on August 31 the miscreant made another call and also sent an obscene video clip,” he said and added that later the girl’s mother lodged a complaint with 1090 and 181. On September 1, when the miscreant again made a video call the girl’s mother lodged a fresh complaint with the police. The parents said that their daughter is under stress and she has lost concentration towards her studies. She is in a state of trauma and has also switched off her phone. ADCP, north zone, Prachi Singh said that an FIR was lodged and the investigation is on.

---||Kolkata||This Durga Puja, more takers for domestic travel than foreign trips||Planning for Durga Puja is on in full swing and the uncertainty around the third wave has prompted many Kolkatans to leave the city and go on long-pending holidays. “Travel bookings for Puja are more than satisfactory. We didn’t expect the demand to be this much. People are clearly fed up with being at home and are longing to travel. Puja has always been one of the best times for holidays. This year, no one is sure if the night curfew will continue during Puja, so most people are planning to travel,” said Anil Punjabi, chairman, eastern region, Travel Agents Federation of India, adding, “The demand for domestic travel is way more than international destinations. While most bookings are coming for Goa, Rajasthan and Kashmir in India, for those going abroad, Russia, France and Dubai are among the top destinations.” Vaccinated and longing to travelIshita Banerjee, a Kolkata-based professional, is going to Bangalore with her daughter Hrit Singhania this Puja. “Ever since the pandemic hit us, we haven’t travelled anywhere. Both of us desperately need a break. Since social distancing is the need of the hour, pandal hopping is out of the question. So we thought it’s better to go out of the city and decided to spend our Puja in Bangalore,” said Ishita. Businesswoman Lalia Dutta Gupta is going to be in Ranthambore with her family this Durga Puja. “We want to avoid the Puja crowd in the city because of the whole COVID situation. Besides, we haven’t had a chance to travel anywhere in the last two years. Now that we are vaccinated, we can confidently go out of the city,” said Lalia. For Sudipto Gupta, another professional from Kolkata, this Puja will be a family affair in Sikkim. “Every year we travel somewhere during Puja holidays as we are not fond of crowded places. We are all the more careful about that now with social distancing becoming the new norm. Sikkim has always been our favourite travel destination,” said Sudipto. Puja cheer for tourism industryWith just one month left for Puja, travel agencies are burning the midnight oil to manage the rising demand. Usha Agarwal from a travel agency in the city is happy with the response she’s getting for Puja holiday. “After the long lull in business, things are finally looking up for the travel and tourism industry. The rush to go out during the four days of Puja is enormous this time. Most people are travelling from Saptami after spending Shashthi in the city. Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Goa and Rajasthan are the most preferred places among tourists this time. There are bookings for the Maldives and Dubai too, but that’s way less than pre-COVID times,” she told us. Bilolaksha Das from a travel agency in Kolkata agreed that the number of people wanting to travel within India is much more than those interested in going abroad. “We are receiving booking requests in large numbers. Himachal Pradesh, Goa, Kashmir, Gujarat and Darjeeling are the hot favourites this season. People are mostly choosing places with minimum COVID cases,” he added. Abhijeet Dhar, from another travel agency, echoed Das. He said, “People are eager to travel after getting double doses of the COVID vaccine. While everyone is in a festive mood during Puja, many of us like to avoid the crowd here. They find it the best time to make holiday plans and this year is no different.” PIX: ISTOCK||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/this-durga-puja-more-takers-for-domestic-travel-than-foreign-trips/articleshow/86110469.cms||Ruman Ganguly
---||Goa||Goa celebrates a quiet, safe Chaturthi||COVID-19 has put a dampener on the Ganesh Chaturthi festivities this year. People are cautious about large family gathering and inviting friends over, and plan to celebrate amongst families itself. Here’s more. No large family gatheringsSeveral large family get-togethers won’t take place. Saloni Sardessai from Caranzalem tells us, “We have a one and a half day Ganpati at my ancestral house in Savoi Verem that’s 350 years old. We have a large family that comes together every year. Unfortunately, the last normal Ganesh Chaturthi we had was 2019, before COVID hit. Around 60-70 of our family come together for the festival. We didn’t celebrate in 2020, but postponed it to Ganesh Jayanti in February 2021. This year we have decided to celebrate, but all of us won’t get together at one time. Family members will visit the house only for some time, and not stay the entire day. People usually get their friends, family and guests, which won’t happen this year. It’s a little disappointing, since all of us really look forward to Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations every year. I’m going only on the first day, and we won’t be there for visarjan next day.” No inviting friends, associates overThe spirit of Chaturthi is heightened by celebrating with friends. DJ Ajit Pai, who would have friends and family over for Ganesh Chaturthi, says, “COVID has affected our celebrations in a big way. Ganesh Chaturthi was a time where not just family, but friends, associates and many people visited. Now we can’t celebrate like that and restrict the celebrations to family only. So it has dampened the spirit of Chaturthi. All the rituals are conducted like before, but the participation of all will be missed. We got to do it for everyone’s safety, and hopefully things will get better by next year. The festive mood is totally missing this year.” Monica, from Chimbel adds, “We celebrate Chaturthi at our sister’s place with the family and neighbours, and last year I was very sceptical about going. This year however, we have decided to go, but will ensure safety by following COVID protocols.” ‘Being careful about who we let into the house to ensure safety for our family’Locals are also ensuring family members are vaccinated before they take part in the family gathering during Chaturthi. Model Prathamesh Maulingkar tells us, “Last year due to COVID many of my family members couldn’t travel. This year is much better. Restrictions are fewer. So atleast some of them can travel. We plan to do aartis together and are looking forward to gathering at our ancestral house and celebrating. It will be a family gathering for the first time since COVID. Almost everyone in my family is vaccinated, but we will take precautions and be very cautious about who we let into our house. Usually we have many many people visiting us, but we will be careful this year.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-celebrates-a-quiet-safe-chaturthi/articleshow/86110509.cms||Flexcia D'Souza

---||World||Afghanistan's Hazaras fear uncertain future despite improved security||KABUL: Hundreds of Hazara worshippers overflowed from a mosque on the outskirts of the Afghan capital on Friday, touching their foreheads to the ground as they took part in the most important prayer of the week. Long persecuted by both the Taliban and Islamic State for their Shiite faith, members of the ethnic minority group say they feel less threatened since the Taliban seized power on August 15. "Previously, during Friday prayers we'd be afraid of attacks from terrorist groups, especially IS," Mahdi Hassanzadah told AFP. "For now the threat is reduced." But after holding top positions in previous US-backed governments, they fear the future consequences of being shut out of the Taliban's new acting administration -- made up of hardline militants of the group's old guard. "It is largely made up of a single ethnicity," Hassanzadah said, referring to the Pashtuns who dominate the Taliban and are Afghanistan's biggest group. "We don't see any participation of the Hazaras, which is a huge concern," he told AFP. The Hazara make up the bulk of the country's Shiite minority, and it is feared the Taliban -- hardliners from the Sunni branch of Islam -- may again turn on them, just as they did during their last regime in the late 1990s. They have suffered some of Afghanistan's most violent assaults, with rallies bombed, hospitals targeted and commuters ambushed. In May, Islamic State suicide bombers targeted a school just 1.6 kilometres (one mile) away from the mosque, killing more than 80 girl students. In the Hazara neighbourhood, there were visibly fewer Taliban fighters on the streets and manning checkpoints, AFP journalists saw. But like many others in the capital, taking home a salary was their most pressing concern, as food prices soar. "The people who used to work for the government have all become unemployed. There's a lot of anxiety and worry," worshipper Suleiman told AFP outside the mosque. "It's not like the Taliban are killing us, but it is better to die than to live suffocated like this." Many government services are no longer functioning, while the international community, which has long propped up the aid-dependent economy, hesitates over funding Afghanistan. "We haven't seen anything bad from the Taliban but there is no work for people, what are we supposed to do about our hunger?" Suleiman said. Comprising between 10 and 20 percent of the country's 38 million people, Hazaras have been marginalised for their faith in a country riven by deep divisions. By some estimates, nearly half of their population was massacred in the late 19th century, with many later enslaved during the conquest of their traditional homeland by Pashtuns. After leading the prayers, Imam Abdul Qadir Alemi told AFP inside the mosque he still hoped the Taliban's acting government would later become representative of the people in the country. "There is no doubt that the people of Afghanistan want an inclusive government in which all ethnicities, followers of all faiths and different segments of society are represented."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/afghanistans-hazaras-fear-uncertain-future-despite-improved-security/articleshow/86110988.cms||---
---||World||Russian space agency boss invites Musk for tea & space talks||MOSCOW: Dmitry Rogozin, head of the Russian space agency Roscosmos, has invited SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to his home to discuss efforts to explore the universe and whether there's life on other planets. In his first interview with CNN, Rogozin appreciated the efforts by Musk in the field of space. "Mr. Elon Musk realises many of the ideas and thoughts that we wanted to realise but did not get to because, after the breakup of the Soviet Union, our space program halted for some time," Rogozin said. "We respect him as an organizer of the space industry and as an inventor, who is not afraid to take risk." Responding to Rogozin's offer on Twitter, Musk said "thanks" and asked, "what is your favourite tea?", to which the Russian space chief replied that they could "start with my grandmother's favourite" blend, posting a picture of a box of 'Three Friendly Elephants' loose-leaf tea. Rogozin took office as Roscosmos' Director General in May 2018, succeeding Igor Komarov. Meanwhile, SpaceX is all set to launch to orbit its first all-civilian mission 'Inspiration4' on September 15. "#Inspiration4 and @SpaceX have completed our flight readiness review and remain on track for launch!" the Inspiration4 mission team said in a tweet recently. Early this year in February, SpaceX announced the charity-driven mission named Inspiration4, which will be commanded by tech entrepreneur Jared Isaacman and will have three others. They will orbit the planet aboard SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule every 90 minutes along a customised flight path. Upon conclusion of the three-day journey, Dragon will re-enter Earth's atmosphere for a soft water landing off the coast of Florida.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/europe/russian-space-agency-boss-invites-musk-for-tea-space-talks/articleshow/86111051.cms||---

Inquiries revealed that the girl’s 19-year-old lover had raped her multiples times and that her 39-year-old father had raped her once. The incident came to light when the girl fell ill and was taken to the Thoothukudi Medical College Hospital for checkup two days ago. The girl from a village near Ottapidaram is studying in Class IX in a government school. Her parents are labourers. The couple started living separately around a year ago due to differences between them. The girl and her mother started to live with her grandparents in another village. Kadambur AWPS inspector A Mariammal said the girl fell in love with the 19-year-old youth who is a now a second year BBA student. The youth frequently visited her. He used to take her out and abused her. This was not known to her mother and grandparents. Around one month ago, the girl’s father visited them and asked his wife and daughter to return to his house. The woman refused to do so. He took his daughter with him. The man sexually abused his daughter once, police said quoting the girl.  The police booked the man and the girl’s lover under sections 5(j)(ii) (rape of minor girl resulting in her pregnancy), 5(l) (committing penetrative sexual offence on a child more than once), 5(n) (penetrative sexual assault by a relative of the child through blood, adoption, marriage, guardianship, foster care or sharing the same household) and 6 (punishment for penetrative sexual assault) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. The duo were arrested on Friday and remanded in judicial custody. “We think she became pregnant in the abuse by her lover as she is in the second month of pregnancy,” inspector Mariammal said. The girl is getting treated in Thoothukudi Government Medical College Hospital, where she is also under counselling by child welfare experts.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tn-girl-raped-impregnated-by-father-and-her-lover/articleshow/86111048.cms||M K Ananth
---||World||Strong typhoon increases in force as it heads toward Taiwan||BANGKOK: A strong typhoon skirted past most of the Philippines on Friday but appeared to be gaining strength as it headed directly for Taiwan this weekend, forecasters said.  The Philippine meteorological agency said Typhoon Chanthu was on the cusp of becoming a category 5 "super typhoon" with sustained winds of 215 kilometers per hour (134 mph) at its center and gusts up to 265 kph (165 mph) as it moved past the extreme northeastern portion of Cagayan province. A super typhoon is one with sustained winds of 220 kph (137 mph) or more. Landfall was still not ruled out for Cagayan and authorities warned that even if the eye of the storm remained off the coast, it could bring flash floods and landslides, as well as gale to storm-force winds on shore, and cause extremely rough seas.  "Mariners are advised to remain in port or take shelter in port until winds and waves subside," the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration said.  Current forecasts are that it will most likely hit the east coast of Taiwan on Sunday morning, with the potential of hitting the island head-on if it tacks more to the west, or missing it entirely if it veers to the east.  Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau has issued a typhoon warning as it tracks the storm.  The bureau said high waves were expected along Taiwan's southern coast and in the Bashi Channel between its southern tip and the northernmost island in the Philippines.  "The likelihood that this typhoon will reach super typhoon category is not ruled out," the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration said in its Friday evening bulletin.  "On Sunday, weakening trend may begin as the typhoon interacts with the rugged terrain of Taiwan but will remain within typhoon category."  The agency added that "public and disaster risk reduction and management offices concerned are advised to take all necessary measures to protect life and property."  On its current course, the typhoon is not expected to hit mainland China but has the potential to by Monday if it moves more westward than currently expected.  Typhoons are called hurricanes in the North Atlantic, central North Pacific and eastern North Pacific, but are the same weather phenomenon.  A smaller typhoon slammed into the eastern Philippines on Tuesday, causing power outages in several provinces before weakening into a severe tropical storm as it moved west-northwest over the Sibuyan Sea.  About 20 typhoons and storms batter the Philippines each year, aside from seasonal monsoon rains. The country also lies in the so-called Pacific "Ring of Fire," a region prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, making it one of the world's most disaster-prone nations.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/strong-typhoon-increases-in-force-as-it-heads-toward-taiwan/articleshow/86111111.cms||---

Born in 1895, Bhave dedicated his life to propagating Gandhian values and is particularly known for "Bhoodan" campaign as he persuaded people across the country to donate a part of their land that he distributed among the landless poor. Modi said his mass movements were aimed at ensuring a better quality of life for the poor and downtrodden. His emphasis on collective spirit will always continue to inspire generations, he said. "Acharya Vinoba Bhave carried forward the noble Gandhian principles after India attained independence. "Mahatma Gandhi described him as someone who was absolutely against untouchability, unwavering in his commitment to India's freedom and a firm believer in non-violence as well as constructive work. He was a thinker par excellence," Modi tweeted. Admired for his simplicity, work and outlook, Bhave's comments seen to be supportive of the Emergency period had also drawn criticism. The Prime Minister also tweeted his tributes to Tamil literary icon Subramania Bharati on his 100th death anniversary on Saturday. "On his 100th Punya Tithi, paying homage to the remarkable Subramania Bharati. We recall his rich scholarship, multi-faceted contributions to our nation, noble ideals on social justice and women empowerment," he said and posted a speech he had given on Bharati in December last year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pm-modi-pays-tributes-to-vinoba-bhave-subramania-bharati/articleshow/86111354.cms||---

The storms that rolled through Thursday night into Friday were followed by weekend forecasts of clear weather and a warming trend in fire areas into next week. The National Weather Service said there were more than 1,100 cloud-to-ground lightning strikes in California between Thursday evening and Friday morning. Fire officials said lightning strikes ignited at least 17 fires. Firefighters were diverted from the huge Caldor Fire south of Lake Tahoe to fight multiple overnight lightning fires throughout El Dorado County, fire officials said. However, most of the blazes were kept to under 10 acres (4 hectares). Three new fires were reported in Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks in steep, dense forest areas of the Sierra Nevada. ``Fire management officials in the parks believe the fires have spread potential and could affect operations in the coming days or weeks,`` a statement from the parks warned. Up to a half-inch of rain fell on portions of the Dixie Fire, which began in mid-July and has burned through huge swaths of the northern Sierra Nevada and southern Cascades. The second-largest fire in California history has burned 1,490 square miles (3,859 square kilometers) of land and more than 1,300 homes and other buildings. It was 59% contained. The rain wet tinder-dry vegetation and will cool down the fire for one or two days, which firefighters hoped to use to strengthen and expand fire lines in an effort to finally surround the blaze, fire officials said. However, after a weekend of clear skies and light winds, a ridge of high pressure could bring a warming trend through next week, Jack Messick, incident meteorologist for the fire, said Friday evening. The rain slowed down the fire but ``once the sun gets on it, the wind's blowing on it, it eventually is going to pick up again and dry off enough and it's going to start running again,'' said Tony Brownell, an operations section chief with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. The threat of new lightning-sparked fires came as more than 13,000 firefighters were working to rein in 13 major fires and more than 12,000 residents were still waiting to return to evacuated homes, according to state agencies. The Caldor Fire, which at its peak forced 22,000 people to evacuate South Lake Tahoe and areas near the Nevada state line, was 53% contained after burning more than 341 square miles (883 square kilometers) and destroying more than 1,000 structures, including hundreds of homes. Lightning blitzes can have disastrous outcomes in parched California. Last year's record amount of land burned included huge Northern California fires that were ignited when remnants of a tropical storm unleashed thousands of bolts. A historic drought and recent heat waves tied to climate change have made wildfires harder to fight in the American West. Scientists say climate change has made the region much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive. President Joe Biden will survey fire damage during a visit to California next week in which he will also campaign for Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat who faces a recall election on Tuesday. Cal Fire, meanwhile, announced that a fire that destroyed 142 structures in the Sierra last month was human-caused but that investigators were still working on details. The River Fire began Aug. 4 in a Placer County campground and was contained Aug. 13.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/rain-helps-in-california-fire-fight-lightning-sparks-others/articleshow/86111433.cms||---

The government, using rates prevalent in gas-surplus nations, fixes the price of natural gas produced by firms such as state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) from fields given to them on nomination basis, every six months. The next review is due on October 1. The price, referred to as APM or administered rate, will rise to USD 3.15 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) for the period from October 1, 2021 to March 31, 2022 from the current USD 1.79, the brokerage said. The rate for gas from deepwater fields such as KG-D6 of Reliance Industries Ltd and BP Plc would rise to USD 7.4 per mmBtu next month. Natural gas is the raw material that is converted into compressed natural gas (CNG) for use in automobiles as fuel or piped to household kitchens for cooking purposes. "The expected surge in APM gas prices would present a challenge to city gas distribution (CGD) players as it would mean a rise in their gas cost for CNG and residential piped natural gas," it said. "APM gas price rise would mean hefty price hikes would have to be made by IGL (that retails CNG in national capital and adjoining cities) and MGL (which retail CNG in Mumbai) in the next one year." The city gas distributors (CGD) "would have to make price hikes of 10-11 per cent in October," ICICI Securities said in a report. Going by the trend in international markets, the APM gas price is likely to rise to USD 5.93 per mmBtu in April 2022 to September 2022 and to USD 7.65 during October 2022 to March 2023. This would mean another 22-23 per cent hike in CNG and piped natural gas prices in April 2022 and 11-12 per cent in October 2022, it said. "Rise in APM gas price from USD 1.79 per mmBtu in H1FY22 to USD 7.65 per mmBtu in H2FY23E would mean MGL and IGL would have to make price hikes of 49-53 per cent during October 2021 to October 2022," it said. "CGD players may be able to make the required hefty price hikes given sharply higher prices of competing fuels, petrol and diesel. However, some hit to prevailing lofty margins of MGL and IGL cannot be ruled out." The rise in gas price would help boost margins of ONGC and Oil India Ltd as well as private companies such as Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/cng-price-may-rise-10-11-in-october-report/articleshow/86111528.cms||---
---||World||9/11 did not change the world – it was already on the path to decades of conflict||BRADFORD: (UK) The September 11 attacks in New York and Washington were visceral in their impact. In less than three hours, the twin towers of the World Trade Center were reduced to a mountain of twisted metal and rubble, killing more than 2,700 people, while hundreds more were killed at the Pentagon. All three were destroyed by men armed with nothing more than parcel knives hijacking fuel-laden passenger aircraft. America was under attack. It came not long after after George W. Bush had formed his new administration with highly influential neoconservatives and assertive realists at the Pentagon and State Department, as well as in the White House itself. All were determined to see the vision of a “new American century” fulfilled – a neoliberal free market world rooted in US experience and guided by its post-cold war progress as the world's sole economic and military superpower. At the time, commentators compared the attack to Pearl Harbor, but the effect of 9/11 was much greater. Pearl Harbor had been an attack by the naval forces of a state already in great tension with the United States. It was against a military base in the pre-television age and away from the continental United States. The 9/11 attack was a much greater shock, and if war with Japan was a consequence of Pearl Harbor, then there would be war after 9/11 even if the perpetrators and those behind them were scarcely known to the American public. The vision of the new American century had to be secured and force of arms was the way to do it, initially against al-Qaida and the Taliban in Afghanistan. A few people argued against war at the time, seeing it as a trap to suck the US into an Afghanistan occupation instead of treating 9/11 as an act of appalling mass criminality, but their voices did not count. The first “war on terror” – against al-Qaida and the Taliban – started within a month, lasted barely two months and seemed an immediate success. It was followed by Bush's State of the Union address in January 2002 declaring an extended war against what Bush referred to as an “axis of evil” of rogue states intent on supporting terror and developing weapons of mass destruction. Iraq was the priority, with Iran and North Korea in the frame. The Iraq War started in March 2003 and was apparently over by May 1, when Bush gave his “mission accomplished” speech from the flight deck of the USS Abraham Lincoln. That was the high point of the entire US-led “war on terror”. Afghanistan was the first disaster, with the Taliban moving back into rural areas within two to three years and going on to fight the US and its allies for 20 years before taking back control last month. In Iraq, even though the insurgents appeared defeated by 2009 and the US could withdraw its forces two years later, Islamic State (IS) rose phoenix-like from the ashes. That led to the third conflict, the intense 2014-18 air war across northern Iraq and Syria, fought by the US, the UK, France and others, killing tens of thousands of IS supporters and several thousand civilians. Even after the collapse of its caliphate in Iraq and Syria, IS arose once again like the proverbial phoenix, spreading its influence as far afield as the Saharan Sahel, Mozambique, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Bangladesh, southern Thailand, the Philippines, back in Iraq and Syria once more and even Afghanistan. The spread across the Sahel was aided by the collapse of security in Libya, the 2011 NATO-led intervention being the fourth of the west's failed wars in barely 20 years. In the face of these bitter failures, we have two linked questions: was 9/11 the beginning of decades of a new world disorder? And where do we go from here? 9/11 in context It is natural to see the single event of 9/11 as turning traditional military postures on their heads, but that is misleading. There were already changes afoot, as two very different events in February 1993, eight years before the attacks, had shown all too well. First, incoming US president, Bill Clinton, had appointed James Woolsey as the new director of the CIA. Asked at his Senate confirmation hearing how he would characterise the end of the cold war, he replied that the US had slain the dragon (the Soviet Union) but now faced a jungle full of poisonous snakes. During the 1990s, and very much in line with Woolsey's phrase, the US military moved from a cold war posture to preparing for small wars in far-off places. There was more emphasis on long-range air strike systems, amphibious forces, carrier battle groups and special forces. By the time Bush was elected in November 2000, the US was far more prepared to tame the jungle. Second, the US military and most analysts around the world missed the significance of a new phenomenon, the rapidly improving ability of the weak to take up arms against the strong. Yet the signs were already there. On February 26 1993, not long after Woolsey had talked of a jungle full of snakes, an Islamist paramilitary group attempted to destroy the World Trade Center with a massive truck bomb placed in the underground car park of the North Tower. The plan was to collapse it over the adjoining Vista Hotel and the South Tower, destroying the entire complex and killing upwards of 30,000 people. The attack failed – though six people died – and the significance of the attack was largely missed even though there were many other indicators of weakness in the 1990s. In December 1994, an Algerian paramilitary group tried to crash an Airbus passenger jet on Paris, an attack foiled by French special forces during a refuelling stop at Marseilles. A month later a bombing by the LTTE of the Central Bank in Colombo, Sri Lanka devastated much of the central business district of Colombo, killing over 80 and injuring more than 1,400 people. A decade before the first World Trade Center attacks, 241 Marines had been killed in a single bombing in Beirut (another 58 French paratroopers were killed by a second bomb in their barrack) and between 1993 and 2001 there were attacks in the Middle East and East Africa including the Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia, an attack on the USS Cole in Aden Harbour and the bombing of US diplomatic missions in Tanzania and Kenya. The 9/11 attacks did not change the world. They were further steps along a well-signed path leading to two decades of conflict, four failed wars and no clear end in sight. What now? That long path, though, has from the start had within it one fundamental flaw. If we are to make sense of wider global trends in insecurity, we have to recognise that in all the analysis around the 9/11 anniversary there lies the belief that the main security concern must be with an extreme version of Islam. It may seem a reasonable mistake, given the impact of the wars, but it still misses the point. The war on terror is better seen as one part of a global trend which goes well beyond a single religious tradition – a slow but steady move towards revolts from the margins. In writing my book, Losing Control, in the late 1990s – a couple of years before 9/11 – I put it this way: What should be expected is that new social movements will develop that are essentially anti-elite in nature and will draw their support from people, especially men, on the margins. In different contexts and circumstances, they may have their roots in political ideologies, religious beliefs, ethnic, nationalist or cultural identities, or a complex combination of several of these. They may be focused on individuals or groups, but the most common feature is an opposition to existing centres of power … What can be said is that, on present trends, anti-elite action will be a core feature of the next 30 years – not so much a clash of civilisations, more an age of insurgencies. This stemmed from the view that the primary factors in global insecurity were a combination of increasing socioeconomic divisions and environmental limits to growth coupled with a security strategy rooted in preserving the status quo. Woolsey's “jungle full of snakes” could be seen as a consequence of this, but there would be military responses available to keep the lid on problems – “liddism” in short. More than two decades down the road, socioeconomic divisions have worsened, the concentration of wealth has reached levels best described as obscene and has even increased dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic, itself leading to food shortages and increased poverty. Meanwhile climate change is now with us, is accelerating towards climate breakdown with, once again, the greatest impact on marginalised societies. It therefore makes sense to see 9/11 primarily as an early and grievous manifestation of the weak taking up arms against the strong, and that military response in the current global security environment woefully misses the point. At the very least there is an urgent need to rethink what we mean by security, and time is getting short to do that.
