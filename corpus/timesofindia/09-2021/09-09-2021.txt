A bronze statue of Havildar Ishar Singh -- who led the army of 22 against thousands of Pathan tribesmen -- installed on a six-feet-tall plinth, where names of all the martyrs have been inscribed, will be unveiled at Wednesfield on the suburbs of Wolverhampton on the occasion of the 124  anniversary of the epic battle.  The 10-feet-tall bronze statue of Ishar Singh holding a small sword has been named Saragarhi Monument.  The battle of Saragarhi was fought on September 12, 1897, where the 22 bravehearts from the 36th Sikh Regiment of the British Indian Army stood firm against an onslaught of thousands of Pathan tribesman at the Saragarhi post between two forts in North-west Frontier Province, now Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan. They had killed numerous tribesmen before laying down their lives.  The Battle of Saragarhi is listed amongst the top eight battles of collective bravery by UNESCO.  Though two gurdwaras have been built in Amritsar and Ferozepur in the memory of the Saragarhi heroes — the Ferozepur memorial being in dire straits — it is the first instance that such a monument has come up in the UK. With the initiative of Wolverhampton City Council, especially councillor Bhupinder Singh Gakhal, in collaboration with Guru Nanak Gurdwara committee and sangat, the monument has been built on the gurdwara premises.  Gakhal told TOI over phone from Wolverhampton that raising the monument of Saragarhi is like a dream come true. “We used to hear about the heroic tales of the valour and gallantry of 21 warriors, but never had thought that we will be able to immortalise them at our own place. It is because of 1 lakh pound collected by sangat and 35,000 pounds contributed by Wolverhampton council that the monument could be ensured.  “A 10-feet-tall bronze statue of Havildar Ishar Singh has been erected on a six-feet-long plinth where names of all 22 soldiers have been inscribed. An eight-metre steel plate, depicting a mountain range and strategic outposts, too form part of the Saragarhi monument.”  He added Akal Takhat Jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh, British MPs and army officers will turn up at the inauguration. The army will play its band and gun shots will be fired as a tribute to the fallen soldiers.  Guru Nanak Gurdwara stage secretary Paramjit Singh said that it will be a moment of pride for the Sikh community, not only in England but the entire world, when the monument is unveiled on September 12 in the presence of the sangat.  Saragarhi was only instance in the history of warfare, where 21 soldiers were posthumously awarded with Indian Order Merit, the highest award given to Indian soldiers at the time, which is equivalent to present-day Param Vir Chakra.  A delegation of British Army officials, led by Brigadier Celia Jane Harvey, had earlier visited the Saragarhi Gurdwara at Ferozepur in 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/bronze-monument-dedicated-to-heroes-of-saragarhi-battle-to-be-unveiled-in-uk-on-its-124th-anniversary/articleshow/86048172.cms||Neel Kamal

The head of the Haqqani Network, possibly the most powerful of all the Taliban factions, is closest to Pakistan’s ISI. His network has been responsible for most of the attacks on Indian interests in Afghanistan, including on the Indian embassy in July 2008 that killed 58 people. Afghanistan crisis live updatesFor India, there are a couple of takeaways from the new appointments — first, the Doha political office finds little favour with the ISI-influenced core Taliban. Sher Mohammed Abbas Stanekzai, who was the political face of the Taliban in Doha is a lowly deputy foreign minister. He recently met the Indian ambassador to Qatar as part of an official outreach. Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, who led the negotiations to the Doha peace deal, is a first deputy, indicating that he and his faction came second in the power sweepstakes. Read AlsoAfghanistan's new 33-member Taliban government: Full listNEW DELHI: The Taliban on Tuesday formed their interim 'Islamic Emirate' government with 33 members, finally ending the speculation around a new government administration, days after their military victory against the US, which forced it to pull out its troops from Afghanistan. With establishedMullah Hassan Akhund, the new PM, a low-key, pre-9/11 Taliban leader close to Mullah Omar, was reportedly responsible for the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas, but lacks a power base of his own. That leaves the reins of power in the hands of the Haqqanis. Second, the overt ascent of Haqqani, a specially designated global terrorist by the UNSC with a bounty on his head, shows the hold Pakistan’s ISI has on the new government. This is a deal stitched by the Pakistan ISI chief Faiz Hameed. But, have they overplayed their hand? The Haqqani Network is the most violent and ruthless element in Afghanistan, and currently controls the security of Kabul. They are also the ones with ties to both ISKP and al-Qaida. Taliban’s new chief of army staff Qari Fasihuddin hails from Badakhshan, with reported close links with ETIM and other jihadi groups. Read AlsoThe Af-Pak border that Taliban do not recogniseWhen the British left the subcontinent in 1947, they didn’t just create a border separating India and Pakistan. They created a potential problem for Afghanistan too, with the Durand Line. Here’s how that is affecting Af-Pak ties today.Bilal Sarwary, Afghan journalist and commentator tweeted, “The Taliban’s “new” cabinet with the appointment of ruthless assassins like Seraj Haqqani, Waseeq, Taj Mir and others in key security & intelligence positions is a warning sign. … the appointments provide the most clear indication the group’s modus operandi hasn’t changed. The absence of Qayum Zakir, Sadar Ibrahim and Daud Mozamil show the Haqqanis have for now emerged victorious in the struggle for power between Loy Kandahar and Loy Paktia.” Almost 18 of the 33 cabinet members are under UNSC 1267 sanctions as global terrorists. This includes Akhund. Four of the infamous “Guantanamo 5” — the Taliban leaders freed in exchange for US solider Bowe Bergdahl — are in positions of power. Pakistan, which is the Taliban’s primary benefactor, is unlikely to deliver exemptions to these sanctions. In fact, until the end of 2022, India holds the chair in the Taliban sanctions committee. Given that nobody has yet recognised the Taliban government, the question is, who will propose their exemption? Without such exemptions, how will the Taliban run the country, particularly if they don’t get access to international finance? The Taliban cabinet as it is, can deepen ethnic faultiness, given that it is almost wholly Pashtun from southern and south-eastern Afghanistan. There are no Hazaras, Uzbeks, Tajiks or any other ethnic group. There is nothing on women’s affairs, while the obscurantist ministry for the promotion of virtue and prevention of vice is back (in Taliban 1.0, that was the job of the current emir, Haibatullah Akhundzada). Their first pronouncement on Wednesday was to prohibit women’s sports. Sooner or later, these faultlines will express themselves as opposition. Protests have started and will be put down brutally. But for how long.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/most-important-man-in-afghanistan-now-is-one-whose-outfit-hit-indias-interests-max/articleshow/86048340.cms||Indrani Bagchi

This time, they should follow real Islamic Sharia as mentioned in the Quran which specifies rights for women, children and the elderly,” she added. “If they adopt this model, only then other countries will conduct business with them. But, if they repeat the methods used by them in the nineties, it will be very difficult for Afghanistan and the rest of the world,” she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/follow-true-islamic-sharia-while-governing-mehbooba-tells-taliban/articleshow/86049839.cms||M Saleem Pandit

All four were detained and interrogated for hours before being released in the evening. While three of the suspects are currently not on the rolls of any known publication, channel, portal or agency, the fourth – identified as Mohammad Abbas Shah – had been working for a Srinagar-based Urdu newspaper until he was sacked by his employer later in the day. Co-accused Showkat Ahmad Motta, a resident of Sheikh Hamza Colony, was a journalist with a couple of English newspapers published from Srinagar before he started his own magazine. The business folded up in 2019. The police also briefly detained Azhar Qadri, a resident of Bemina Abubaker Colony, is said to have worked for a Punjab-based publication until the owners shut it down. Qadri then became active on social media. The police also raided the house of Hilal Ahmad Mir alias Saqi, a former journalist with a national newspaper and the son of a National Conference worker. He had been fired by his employer after six months on the job for his allegedly inflammatory writings, sources said. Besides "Kashmir Fight", multiple propaganda blogs started in Pakistan are now run through journalists in Kashmir, many of them either not attached to any news outlet or retrenched.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/4-jk-journalists-homes-raided-in-crackdown-on-terror-conduits/articleshow/86049951.cms||M Saleem Pandit

The break-in at the Swindon Hindu Temple in Wiltshire was discovered by staff on Saturday. Temple chairman Pradeep Bhardwaj reported it to the police and to Swindon Borough Council and is calling for 24x7 security to be deployed immediately. He is also seeking an urgent meeting with the Wiltshire police and crime commissioner and the chief constable, given it is the fifth break-in at the temple. "The burglars have broken all doors in the temple, vandalised many rooms, taken away thousands of pounds of cash and other expensive items," he said.  "They have also entered the main altar of the temple, where the deities are placed, and vandalised that area — this is a highly sanctified and consecrated space where only priests are allowed to enter. This is a matter of great concern and of utmost sensitivity for all Hindus, not just in Swindon and in the UK but globally," he said. It will impact the religious sentiments of more than 10,000 people in Swindon and thousands more in the region, he said. "This is the only Hindu temple in this entire area, the county and much beyond, and since it had been closed for most part of the last 18 months, the community was very eagerly looking forward to resume their normal activities, especially since the main Hindu festival period has just started," he said. "We are at a breaking point right now in every sense," he said. Police and forensic teams spent several hours at the site. A Wiltshire police spokesman confirmed officers were called to the location on Saturday "following a burglary which is believed to have happened the night before". Enquiries are ongoing.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/uk/burglars-break-into-hindu-temple-in-swindon-for-fifth-time-vandalise-sacred-altar/articleshow/86050292.cms||NAOMI CANTON

Official sources said the meeting saw substantive exchanges, with both sides expressing similar views on most issues including terrorism and the need for Taliban to fulfil its commitments. National security adviser Ajit Doval is learned to have told his counterpart Nikolay Patrushev that Pakistan has the “special responsibility” of ensuring that Afghanistan’s soil was not used to spread terrorism and carry out anti-India activities. India has repeatedly said in the past few weeks that its primary objective for now is to ensure that Pakistan-based terror groups don’t use Afghan territory to mount attacks against others. Afghanistan crisis live updatesAccording to Russia, the two sides discussed “humanitarian and migration problems” in Afghanistan, as well as prospects for Russian-Indian joint efforts aimed at creating conditions for launching a peaceful settlement process on the basis of an intra-Afghan dialogue. “In addition, they agreed to coordinate the approaches of Russia and India in multilateral formats on the Afghan settlement,” said the Russian statement. The meeting on Afghanistan took place a day ahead of the BRICS summit, in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi is again expected to highlight concerns on terrorism, and also SCO summit next week where Pakistan PM Imran Khan will also be present.

Official sources said this was the first “detailed and extensive” review of the Afghanistan situation involving MEA, defence ministry and security agencies with Russia after the fall of Kabul to Taliban on August 15. India is also learnt to have expressed concern over security of minorities, including Hindus and Sikhs in Afghanistan.

They agreed on the need for Taliban to adhere to its commitments and on “presence of international terrorist groups in Afghanistan and threat from terrorism to central Asia and India”. The sides also expressed similar views on Islamic radicalisation and extremism, flow of weapons to terrorist groups and smuggling across Afghan borders and also “high chances of Afghanistan becoming hub of opium production and trafficking”. “The two sides discussed concrete forms of future bilateral cooperation among security agencies, including close coordination, upgrading consultations and exchange of information,” said an official. “The importance of defining parameters of the future state structure of Afghanistan by the Afghans themselves, as well as the need to prevent the escalation of violence, social, ethnic and confessional contradictions in the country, were emphasized,” said Russia. In separate comments, India’s envoy to Russia Venkatesh Varma said neither the Doha talks nor the Troika Plus talks have yielded the right results. “India was not a direct participant in the Doha talks. India was also not part of the Troika Plus mechanism... I think one lesson is that it is better that India and Russia work together with respect to Afghanistan. That is the most important lesson for us.” Speaking to RIA Novosti on the eve of Russian NSA Patrushev’s visit, Varma said, “There’s now a new situation in Afghanistan. All the foreign troops have left. The Taliban has taken over in Kabul, but instability continues.” “There are very fast-moving developments in Afghanistan... Press reports say a number of slogans were raised against external interference in Afghanistan, particularly from Pakistan.” Expanding on India’s recently articulated ‘Far East Policy’ which includes a $1billion credit line for Indian businesses to participate in the development of the Russian Far East, Varma said it would create “new connectivities and an Energy Bridge from Yamal to Vladivostok to Chennai. So energy is emerging as a very important pillar of our cooperation”.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/up-to-pakistan-to-stop-terror-in-afghanistan-india-tells-russia/articleshow/86050932.cms||Sachin Parashar

This past weekend, however, the market was busier than usual. Late last week, rumours started doing rounds that the market will soon be closed for good. There were social media posts and WhatsApp forwards among residents, which piqued everyone's curiosity. "We were puzzled by the message that the market was closing in two days," says Ravi Singh, a Gurgaon resident who visited the market on Saturday, "When we went there, we realised the prices were lower than usual because the sellers were clearing their stocks." Sellers in the market say they saw some 'officials' visit the market on Friday evening giving them a two-day notice to vacate the area. "On Friday, some officials came to tell us that we had to leave this area in two days. We don't know where they were from, or whether this is official, or just a rumour. But we are clearing our stocks just in case," says a shopkeeper at the market who did not wish to be named. There were social media posts and WhatsApp forwards among residents, which piqued everyone’s curiosityCuriously enough, none of the authorities in the Millennium City has clarity on any drive to vacate the market, which occupies the service lane and footpath across several residential colonies in Sector 56. The administration has no clarity on any plans to vacate the market either. "There have been efforts to combat the encroachment done by street markets in various parts of the city. We are trying to regularise them to reduce traffic snarls and discomfort caused to nearby residents," says an official from the MCG, without specifying about the Banjara Market in particular. Despite there being no official clarity, the nervous sellers slashed prices of all their wares, resulting in a huge sale over the weekend. When we visited the market on Sunday evening, the asking prices for most of the things were 20-30% lower than usual and many sellers were willing to haggle even on that. "We don't know if the market will be here or not by next week. There is a lot of uncertainty, which is why we reduced our prices," says Naresh, who sells rugs and other items at the market. Despite there being no official clarity, the nervous sellers slashed prices of all their wares, resulting in a huge sale over the weekendAs soon as word of this 'fire sale' spread across the city through word of mouth and social media, it led to an increased rush at the popular market with Gurugrammers thronging the place, in a bid to get the best bargain. Nachiket Singh, who went to the market twice over the weekend, says, "I bought stools, carpets, and other items of home décor worth Rs 8,000. And I guess I may have saved Rs 2,000-3,000 easily. That's how cheap things were there." Many of the shoppers said they discovered the rumours only once they were there. Rajesh Khanna, who lives in Sector 56, tells us, "I live nearby so come here most weekends. I went to the market randomly on Sunday and realised the prices were much lower. That's when I got to know about the reports of the market shutting down. That explains why it was so extra crowded there this weekend." As of Tuesday, the market was still running. "Most of the shops are still there. They have lowered their prices in hopes of clearing their stocks in case they have to vacate the area. They are still uncertain about it," says Nitin, a Sector 43 resident who visited the market recently.

---||Delhi||Delhi to celebrate this year's Ganpati with live streamed darshans and smaller, sanitised pandals||In any other year, with Ganesh Chaturthi approaching, organising committees of the various pandals in the capital would have been in battle-ready mode right now, making frenetic arrangements. The pandemic has changed that drastically. Last year, all on-ground events had to be cancelled on account of COVID-19 and organisers had hoped to resume celebrations this year. But with restrictions on public gatherings in place in Delhi and neighbouring districts of NCR, all Ganpati puja pandals this year are going for low-key celebrations, using technology to reach out to more people. The Ganpati celebrations in Delhi may not rival the grand ones of Mumbai but they have been getting bigger and more extravagant for years now. This year, however, due to the pandemic, all pandals in NCR will have drastically scaled-down celebrations. Instead of the usual 10-day celebrations, most pandals will be set up only for three or four days. Pandal organisers say they are holding a token celebration so that the tradition of holding Ganpati celebrations is not broken. Deepak Bhardwaj from Sarvajanik Ganesh Mandal, which organises the pandal in Ramesh Nagar, says, "We are erecting a much smaller pandal this year within the premises of a local school. There will be very limited darshans because of social distancing rules in place. Our main focus will be on the daily puja and a yajna, where we will pray to Ganpati to rid us of COVID. Given everything that has happened around us this year, a big extravagant celebration would not be right." Pandal organisers say they are holding a token celebration so that the tradition of holding Ganpati celebrations is not brokenEven as the pandals will allow limited people, they have dedicated teams to look after social distancing measures and ensure there is constant air and surface sanitisation. Hand sanitiser stations and CCTV are being installed. Mahendra Ladda, Founder President, Ganesh Seva Mandal, which organises Delhi ka Maharaja in Laxmi Nagar, tells us, "We have kept 30 minutes darshan slots for our members and each slot will accommodate maximum 20 people only. There would be a gap of half an hour after every slot of darshan for air and surface sanitisation and disinfection of the premises." With social distancing requirements meaning fewer people being allowed for physical darshan of the Ganpati idol at the pandal, technology is being used to amplify reach. "For all the people, whom we won't be able to accommodate for the physical darshan of Ganpati, we have arranged for Facebook live darshan through our Facebook page link," adds Ladda. Apart from the curtailed programme, all the pandals in the capital are going for smaller eco-friendly Ganpati idols along with a small-scale, eco-friendly visarjan. Most pujas are going for visarjan in a tub or tank within the premises to avoid crowds. All proceedings will be live-streamed through Facebook and YouTube. Most pandals will have a small-scale, eco-friendly visarjanBut the cultural programmes that used to be at the heart of these celebrations have not disappeared completely. They exist in the virtual world with organisers using Zoom, Facebook and YouTube to telecast them, either live or delayed. Makrand Sakhare from the Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav Samiti Gurgaon tells us, "We have asked kids to perform at their homes and send us those videos. We will share those performances with members and other members of the general public through Facebook and YouTube. This way, we can have cultural performances without being physically present. Everything has gone online during the pandemic, from offices to schools. So why can't Ganpati puja." Several others will host cultural programmes at the pandal without an audience and livestream them through social media.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-to-celebrate-this-years-ganpati-with-live-streamed-darshans-and-smaller-sanitised-pandals/articleshow/86041397.cms||Abhimanyu Mathur
---||World||Covid-19 surge in the US: The summer of hope ends in gloom||WASHINGTON: The summer that was supposed to mark America's independence from the Covid-19 is instead drawing to a close with the United States more firmly under the tyranny of the virus, with deaths per day back up to where they were in March.  The Delta variant is filling hospitals, sickening alarming numbers of children and driving coronavirus deaths in some places to the highest levels of the entire pandemic. School systems that reopened their classrooms are abruptly switching back to remote learning because of outbreaks. Legal disputes, threats and violence have erupted over mask and vaccine requirements.  The US death toll stands at more than 650,000, with one major forecast model projecting it will top 750,000 by December 1.  "It felt like we had this forward, positive momentum," lamented Katie Button, executive chief and CEO at two restaurants in Asheville, North Carolina. "The Delta variant wiped that timeline completely away."  It wasn't supposed to be this way. More than six months into the US vaccination drive, President Joe Biden held a White House party on July Fourth to celebrate the country's freedom from the virus, and other political leaders had high hopes for a close-to-normal summer.  Then the bottom fell out.  The summer wave was fueled by the extra-contagious Delta variant combined with stark resistance to vaccinations that formed along political and geographic lines, said Dr Sten Vermund, of the Yale School of Public Health.  "The virus was more efficient in spreading among the unvaccinated so that you blunted the expected benefit of vaccines," Vermund said.  The crisis escalated rapidly from June to August. About 400,000 Covid-19 infections were recorded for all of June. It took all of three days last week to reach the same number.  The US recorded 26,800 deaths and more than 4.2 million infections in August. The number of monthly positive cases was the fourth-highest since the start of the pandemic.  The 2021 Delta-driven onslaught is killing younger Americans at a much higher rate than previous waves of the pandemic in the Northeast last spring, the Sun Belt in the summer of 2020 and the deadly winter surge around the holidays.  During the peaks of those waves, Americans over 75 years of age suffered the highest proportion of death. Now, the most vulnerable age group for death is 50 to 64.  Overall, the outbreak is still well below the all-time peaks reached over the winter, when deaths topped out at 3,400 a day and new cases at a quarter-million per day.  The US is now averaging over 150,000 new cases per day, levels not seen since January. Deaths are close to 1,500 per day, up more than a third since late August.  Even before the Delta variant became dominant, experts say there were indications that larger gatherings and relaxed social distancing measures were fueling new cases.  "We had been cooped up for over a year and everyone wanted to get out," said Dr David Dowdy, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. "In the face of that kind of strong change in behaviour, even getting almost two-thirds of our adult population vaccinated wasn't enough."  The Covid-19 vaccines remain highly effective against hospitalisation and death, but many tens of millions of eligible Americans remain unvaccinated. Nearly 40% of Americans, aged 12 and older are not fully protected.  Yale's Vermund sees reasons to be cautiously optimistic about the next few months. Cases in most states appear to be plateauing and are likely to decline in the fall, buying health authorities more time to vaccinate adults and teenagers before flu season.  "If we can continue making progress between now and Thanksgiving, we may be able to substantially blunt the coronavirus surge in flu season," Vermund said.  While the economy has been rebounding strongly over the past several months, hiring slowed sharply in August in a sign that the variant is discouraging Americans from flying, shopping or eating out.  And on Monday, unemployment benefits - including an extra $300 a week from the federal government - ran out for millions of Americans.  Button, the North Carolina chef, was feeling great heading into the summer. Her team was mostly vaccinated in May and restrictions were loosening. But the crisis soon changed direction.  Button supports the mask mandate that was recently reinstated in her county but said her employees are exhausted by having to enforce it.

What separates this eighth ranker from most of the country pairs in the top 10 listing, though, is the air fare — with the cheapest return fare on non-stop flights from cities such as Delhi, Mumbai to Dubai this weekend starting at Rs 65,000. TOI compared 48-hour advance purchase fares on flights operating between the top 10 country pairs and found passengers flying India-UAE, Mexico-US and Spain-Italy this month would be paying the most for air tickets, especially those spending on 48-hour advance purchase tickets for travel this weekend. On Wednesday, the cheapest return ticket on non-stop flights from Mumbai to Dubai for travel this weekend (September 10, return September 13) started at Rs 62,000, offered by Emirates, and for travel from Delhi it was Rs 70,000, on FlyDubai. Weekend flights to Dubai are in high demand as a 24-hour advance purchase flight cost a tad less — Rs 60,000 return fare on a non-stop flight from Mumbai to Dubai for travel on Thursday, that is. For cheaper options there were transit flights, like the Mumbai-Lucknow-Dubai Air India return flight, the fare for which began at Rs 50,000 for travel this weekend. Pre-pandemic, Mumbai-Dubai return fare began at Rs 26,000 for a round trip. Then again, the number of seats on offer were high. For instance: In September 2019, airlines flew 32% more seats between India and UAE as compared to September 2021, shows OAG data. The demand for flights to the UAE is particularly high this month with IPL 2021 to be held there from September 19. Dubai is also the most popular medium-haul international holiday destination out of India. With the UAE opening up for fully vaccinated passengers from India on August 30 after a four-month-long ban, air fares have jumped. UAE-India was the second busiest country pair globally from January to April, till the second Covid-19 wave disrupted the trend. On April 25, the UAE banned passengers from India, including transit passengers, with entry allowed only to UAE residents, golden visa holders or those travelling on diplomatic visas, among such others. The entry norms were first relaxed on August 5, with passengers from India allowed to transit through Dubai. The most expensive fares for travel this weekend, though, is on the second busiest country pair — Mexico-US. Airfares on non-stop flights begin at Rs 73,000 for a Mexico City to New York round trip this weekend. On all the other flights of top 10 city pairs, 48-hour advance purchase air fares are spectacularly low. For instance, Spain-UK is the top country pair with 32 lakh seats to be flown in September, almost three times higher than India-UAE seats. You could buy a round trip on Barcelona-London non-stop flights for travel this weekend for Rs 18,000 though, while for Madrid-London it is Rs 13,000.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/india-uae-route-8th-in-top-10-country-pair-list/articleshow/86051531.cms||Manju V
---||Delhi||Chargesheets only to keep people in jail: Delhi court||NEW DELHI: A city court came down heavily on Delhi police for filing chargesheets under the Arms Act without the requisite official sanction despite a considerable period of time lapsing, saying the only objective appeared to be to keep the accused behind bars. Granting bail to a man arrested in November last year and chargesheeted without sanction, chief metropolitan magistrate Arun Kumar Garg on Tuesday directed the Delhi police commissioner to take action against the erring officers and ensure such instances are not repeated. “I would like to note that a number of chargesheets are being filed by the Crime Branch for the offence u/s 25 (possession of illegal firearms) of the Arms Act alone without requisite sanction u/s 39 (previous sanction of the district magistrate) of the Arms Act despite the expiry of considerable period of time. No sanction filed till date, bail in Arms Act caseThe only purpose for filing of the chargesheets without requisite sanction...despite knowing fully well that the court shall not be able to take cognisance of the offence for want of sanction, appears to be to keep the accused behind the bars while defeating their right to default bail,” Garg said, noting that “no steps for filing of the supplementary chargesheet with requisite sanction are taken by DCP Crime Branch unless prodded by the court”. The court sought an explanation from the DCP within three days. The court granted bail to the man arrested in November last year, noting that he was chargesheeted only for the offence under section 25 of the Arms Act, but the court is unable to take cognisance due to non-filing of the required sanction till date. The judge noted that one last opportunity was given to DCP (Crime Branch) in August this year under intimation to the joint commissioner of police, Crime Branch, to file the sanction within three days, but it appeared to have “fallen on deaf ears”. “It has been noticed by the court that despite repeated directions to the DCP Crime Branch to ensure filing of the replies/reports by the IOs (investigating officers) after getting the same forwarded by senior officers, the reports/replies are still not being forwarded by the senior officers from the Crime Branch which amounts to supervisory lapse on the part of not only the ACPs Crime Branch but also on the part of DCP Crime Branch,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/chargesheets-only-to-keep-people-in-jail/articleshow/86051757.cms||Usha Das

It passed the order on a batch of pleas seeking to end manual scavenging. “It is heartening that no further death of any safai karmachari is reported. There can’t be any manual scavenging at all and it will continue to be the responsibility of all municipal bodies and corporations across the state to ensure that there’s no manual scavenging activity undertaken,” the court said. The commissioners of the corporations and the heads of municipalities, as indicated in previous orders, will be personally held liable in case any manual scavenging activity is detected or any mishap occurs in course thereof, it added. “The state should endeavour to obtain appropriate machines or improve sewer lines to ensure that no manual scavenging is necessary anywhere in the state,” the bench said. The court adjourned the matter to November 10 for the state to place its template for norms to be issued in such regard.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/make-no-manual-scavenging-pledge-hc-to-civic-chiefs/articleshow/86051973.cms||---

In a relief to ED director Sanjay Kumar Mishra whose extension of one year beyond his retirement age was challenged, a bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and BR Gavai refused to quash the government’s decision to extend his tenure saying his tenure is coming to an end in November but directed that no further extension be granted to him. “We should make it clear that extension of tenure granted to officers who have attained the age of superannuation should be done only in rare and exceptional cases. Reasonable period of extension can be granted to facilitate the completion of ongoing probes only after reasons are recorded by committee constituted under Section 25 (a) of the CVC Act,” the bench said. “Any extension of tenure granted to persons holding the post of director of Enforcement after attaining the age of superannuation should be for a short period. We don’t intend to interfere with the extension of tenure of the second respondent (Mishra) in the instant case for the reason that his tenure is ending in November.We make it clear that no further extension shall be granted to him,” it said. Enumerating Section 25 (d) of CVC Act, the bench said tenure of ED director can be beyond two years as the provision says the tenure should be minimum two years. Mishra was appointed ED director for two years in November 2018. In November 2020, his term was replaced by three years. Justifying the decision, the government said that the tenure was extended as many cases on money laundering were at a crucial stage and change of guard could hamper the probe and prosecution.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/supreme-court-lets-govt-extend-ed-chiefs-tenure/articleshow/86051982.cms||Amit Anand Choudhary

They (administration) are not ready to suspend and register an FIR against him. The meeting lasted around three hours, but the officers are getting directions from Chandigarh. Hence, we will continue our protest in Karnal until our demands are met,” Tikait said. Sinha was seen in a video purportedly asking police personnel to smash the heads of protesters assembled there on August 28. There will be another morcha (protest site) in Haryana, Tikait said. This protest will run parallel to the ongoing agitation at sites along the Delhi border. Farmers from Uttar Pradesh and other states will also visit Karnal, he said. Protesters also burnt effigies of Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar, according to SKM. SKM also wants the government to pay Rs 25 lakh in compensation and give a job to the kin of farmer Sushil Kajal, who died at home after being allegedly injured in the lathicharge.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/haryana-refuses-to-scalp-sdm-karnal-impasse-on/articleshow/86052018.cms||Amit Kumar
---||India||Supreme Court junks PIL on jabs at home, slams petitioner||NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to wade further into executive turf and rejected a PIL seeking door-to-door Covid vaccination drive while reminding the petitioner that the court has already nudged the government towards announcing free universal immunisation of all above 18 years of age. Petitioner Youth Bar Association pleaded that since "the third wave of pandemic is round the corner", the SC should step in to direct the Centre and states to complete vaccination of all adult population by invigorating the vaccination drive and by starting door-to-door vaccination to save thousands from succumbing to the infection, which was witnessed during second wave. A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud, Vikram Nath and Hima Kohli gave an earful to the petitioner for picking up an issue, without doing any research and rushing to the court with a writ petition. "No one applies their mind to its feasibility. Can we say the same condition prevails uniformly from Ladakh to Uttar Pradesh to Kerala? Can we as a court assess the feasibility of a door-to-door vaccination drive given the diverse geographic and pandemic situations as well as complexities of governance? There are issues which cannot be addressed through a single uniform direction for the entire country." Justice Chandrachud-led bench said the SC has already taken suo motu cognisance of the vaccination and covid situation and constituted a National Task Force comprising eminent doctors who are working in close coordination with the government to meet the exigencies of managing Covid situation as well as other related issues like vaccination. Within days of the SC flagging the issue of free vaccination, the PM had announced free vaccination for all at government vaccination centres. The Bench said, "the vaccination has proceeded quite satisfactorily and it cannot now be scrapped and ordered to be replaced with door-to-door vaccination. Nearly half of the adult population has received the first dose of vaccine." It asked the petitioner association to give its suggestions to the authorities. Advocate Sriram Parakkat, arguing for another PIL, sought a host of directions including treating each and every Covid death as a case of medical negligence and grant of suitable compensation. The bench termed the prayer and relief sought for as preposterous. "When such large number of persons unfortunately lost their lives in the first and second wave of pandemic and when the frontline health workers worked almost round the clock, it would be fat fetched for the court to assume that all deaths happened because of medical negligence and pass an omnibus order," the bench headed by Justice Chandrachud said. SC also drew the petitioner's attention to its judgment in Reepak Kansal case where the court has directed the Union government to determine the quantum of ex-gratia that is needed to be paid to kin of each of the persons who succumbed to Covid in the last one and half years. SC refused to entertain this PIL also but gave Parakkat the liberty to redraft his PIL if the need be for filing it afresh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/supreme-court-junks-pil-on-jabs-at-home-slams-petitioner/articleshow/86052069.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||India||Govt announces early MSP for rabi crops in bid to calm farm protests||NEW DELHI: In the earliest announcement of minimum support price (MSP) for rabi crops in recent years, the Cabinet on Wednesday approved support prices of six crops with the highest percentage hike (8.6%) to mustard and rapeseeds and lowest to wheat (2%) for the marketing season beginning April 1 next year. The underlying message in the MSP hikes is to encourage farmers to opt for crop diversification and boost production of oil seeds. The early announcement is also seen as an attempt to send a positive signal to farm unions in Punjab, Haryana and western UP agitating over farms laws interpreted by them as intended to eventually end the MSP regime. The increase for wheat, though small, takes the MSP to Rs 2,015 a quintal and reflects the overall higher support that the cereal, along with rice, has received under the procurement system. Though all six rabi crops have got an MSP hike compared to previous year, an analysis of increase in cost of production, however, shows negative returns in the case of wheat and barley in absolute terms. The estimated increase in cost of production of both wheat and barley is Rs 48 per quintal each over previous year, but the MSP hike is Rs 40 per quintal and Rs 35 per quintal, respectively, for the 2022-23 rabi marketing season. At the same time, the returns over cost of production would be 100% for wheat and 60% for barley. The highest hike to mustard and rapeseed is, on the other hand, in sync with the government’s increasing focus on oilseeds in order to reduce the country’s dependence on imports. Similarly, a good hike in MSP of lentils (masur) too reflects the priority on pulses, the price rise of which invariably causes heartburn among consumers. The MSP announcement gives a signal to farmers ahead of the sowing season so that they can make the right choice of crops and opt for diversification in advance. The higher MSP and procurement have also been quoted by the government as evidence of the Centre's commitment towards both along with higher investments in mandis. "All those who have been propagating misleading information must take a message from the announcement. The rate of MSP and procurement of crops at support prices are increasing continuously after the enactment of the farm laws," agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar said. He also flagged Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s assurance on the issue, saying MSP is very much there and would continue. "There should not be any doubt about the fate of MSP in anyone’s mind," said Tomar. Past records show that the Centre has never made an announcement of MSP for rabi crops as early as in first half of September when even sowing operations of kharif (summer-sown) crops continue in certain regions. Except for last year, when it was announced a day after the passing of the contentious farm bills in Parliament on September 21, the announcement is either made in October or later in November or December. Once it was announced as late as almost the end of the rabi sowing season on January 29 in 2009 during UPA-I.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/govt-announces-early-msp-for-rabi-crops-in-bid-to-calm-farm-protests/articleshow/86051117.cms||Vishwa Mohan

The move now puts the one-off men's Test match between Australia and Afghanistan for November in Hobart under doubt. "I don't think women will be allowed to play cricket because it is not necessary that women should play cricket. In cricket, they might face a situation where their face and body will not be covered. Islam does not allow women to be seen like this. It is the media era, and there will be photos and videos, and then people watch it. Islam and the Islamic Emirate do not allow women to play cricket or play the kind of sports where they get exposed," said Ahmadullah Wasiq, the deputy head of the Taliban's cultural commission, in an interview to SBS News. In November 2020, twenty-five female cricketers were awarded central contracts by the Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB). It also held a 21-day training camp for 40 female cricketers in Kabul. The International Cricket Council (ICC) requires all 12 of its full members to have a national women's team and only full members of the ICC are permitted to play Test matches. When asked if no women's cricket would mean ICC calling off the Hobart Test, Wasiq said the Taliban would not compromise. "Even for this, if we face challenges and problems, we have fought for our religion so that Islam is to be followed. We will not cross Islamic values even if it carries opposite reactions. We will not leave our Islamic rules." He added that Islam allowed women to go out on a needs basis such as shopping and that sport is not considered a need. "In cricket and other sports, women will not get an Islamic dress code. It is obvious that they will get exposed and will not follow the dress code, and Islam does not allow that." Australia's Trade Minister Dan Tehan described the decision by the Taliban to ban female athletes from playing sports as "incredibly, incredibly disappointing". "Most Australians would be absolutely abhorred at the idea that girls (and) 'omen wouldn't be allowed to play sport. This is something that our sporting codes will have to think about and look at very carefully. The idea that you would stop females playing sport is something that would go against what every Australian would think is the right thing to do," said Tehan to reporters in Canberra on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/women-in-afghanistan-wont-be-allowed-to-play-sport-including-cricket-says-taliban/articleshow/86052131.cms||---
---||World||Statue of Gen. Robert E. Lee comes down in Virginia capital||RICHMOND: One of the nation's largest Confederate monuments came down Wednesday as workers removed a figure of Gen. Robert E. Lee that towered over Virginia's capital city for more than a century and became a target of protesters seeking to abolish symbols of racism.  A crowd of onlookers erupted in cheers and song as the massive figure was lowered to the ground. A construction worker who strapped harnesses around Lee and his horse lifted his arms in the air and counted "three, two, one" to jubilant shouts from hundreds of people. A work crew then began cutting it into pieces.  "Any remnant like this that glorifies the lost cause of the Civil War, it needs to come down," said governor Ralph Northam, who called it "hopefully a new day, a new era in Virginia." The Democrat said the statue represented "more than 400 years of history that we should not be proud of".  Sharon Jennings, an African American woman born and raised in Richmond, said she had mixed feelings seeing it go.  "It's a good day, and it's a sad day at the same time," said Jennings, 58. "It doesn't matter what colour you are, if you really like history, and you understand what this street has been your whole life and you've grown up this way, you're thinking, 'Oh, my God.' But when you get older, you understand that it does need to come down."  Some chanted, "Whose streets? Our streets," and sang, "Hey, hey, hey, goodbye". One man with a Black Lives Matter flag was escorted out by police after running into the fenced-off work area. No arrests were reported, and there was no sign of a counter protest.  Workers used a power saw to cut the statue in two along the general's waist, so that it can be hauled under highway overpasses to an undisclosed state-owned facility until a decision is made about its future.  The job was overseen by Team Henry Enterprises, led by Devon Henry, a Black executive who faced death threats after his company's role in removing Richmond's other Confederate statues was made public last year. He said the Lee statue posed their most complex challenge.  "It won't transport in this height, so we need to lift the rider off the horse and transport it that way. From a thickness standpoint, we don't know how long it will take. Are there iron supports? It's a total mystery," Henry said Wednesday.  By mid-afternoon, the pieces were gone. They were hauled away on a flatbed truck to cheers from the remaining crowd.  Northam ordered the statue's removal last summer, citing nationwide pain over the death of George Floyd at the hands of white police officers in Minneapolis. Litigation tied up his plans until the Supreme Court of Virginia cleared the way last week.  The 21-foot (6-m) bronze sculpture sat atop a granite pedestal nearly twice that tall, towering above Monument Avenue since 1890 in this former capital of the Confederacy.  State, capitol and city police officers closed streets for blocks around the state-owned traffic circle and used heavy equipment and barriers to keep crowds at a distance. The Federal Aviation Administration granted the state's request to ban drone flights, and the event was livestreamed through the governor's Facebook and Twitter accounts.  "This is a historic moment for the city of Richmond. The city, the community at large is saying that we're not going to stand for these symbols of hate in our city anymore," said Rachel Smucker, 28, a white woman who moved to Richmond three years ago. "I've always found it to be offensive, as a symbol of protecting slavery and the racism that people of colour still face today."  The pedestal is to remain for now, although workers are expected to remove decorative plaques and a time capsule on Thursday.  After Floyd's death, the area around the statute became a hub for protests and occasional clashes between police and demonstrators. The pedestal has been covered by constantly evolving, colorful graffiti, with many of the hand-painted messages denouncing police and demanding an end to systemic racism and inequality.  The sculpture was valued for its artistic quality, and it stood among four other massive Confederate statues that were removed by the city last summer.  The decisions by the governor and Richmond mayor Levar Stoney to remove the Confederate tributes marked a major victory for civil rights activists, whose previous calls to remove the statues had been steadfastly rebuked by city and state officials alike. A statue of Black tennis hero and Richmond native Arthur Ashe erected in 1996 is expected to stay.  "I think it's pretty apropos that the only remaining monument on this tree-lined street is Arthur Ashe, and I'm pretty confident he'll withstand the test of time," Stoney said.  A previous wave of advocacy and resistance led to a rally of white supremacists in the city of Charlottesville that erupted into violence in 2017. Other Confederate monuments started falling around the country.  In Virginia, local governments were hamstrung by a state law protecting memorials to war veterans. That law was amended by the new Democratic majority at the Statehouse and signed by Northam, allowing localities to decide the monuments' fate as of July 1, 2020.  Stoney then moved swiftly, citing the continuing demonstrations and concerns that protesters could get hurt if they tried to bring down the enormous statues themselves. Protesters had already toppled a statue of Confederate President Jefferson Davis before Stoney's decree. Work crews then removed removed statues of Gen. Thomas "Stonewall" Jackson, Confederate naval officer Matthew Maury and Gen. JEB Stuart from the thoroughfare.  The changes have remade the prestigious avenue, which is lined with mansions and tony apartments and is partly preserved as a National Historic Landmark district. Northam has tapped the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts to lead a community-driven redesign for the whole avenue.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/statue-of-gen-robert-e-lee-comes-down-in-virginia-capital/articleshow/86052289.cms||---

The court was hearing a PIL on Tuesday filed by advocate Sohan Mishra seeking doorstep vaccination for elderly and differently-abled sections of the population. The National Expert Group on vaccine administration for Covid-19 had recommended adoption of NHCVC. Accordingly, the central government had issued letters to all state governments for implementing NHCVC from May 27, 2021. On July 28, the HC had directed the additional chief secretary health & family welfare to place before the court complete details of the steps taken for implementation of NHCVC by way of an affidavit. In an affidavit, additional chief secretary health & family welfare Pradipta Kumar Mohapatra said that under the national Covid-19 vaccination programme, the vaccination status of each beneficiary is being captured in Co-WIN web portal. The manual database of vaccination is not being captured under the national Covid-19 vaccination programme at the district and state level. “In the report section of the said portal, there is no facility available to know the actual number of NHCVCs that were conducted in the state and the number of elderly and differently-abled citizens received the vaccination services in such NHCVCs,” Mohapatra said. The affidavit said 34,09,117 people aged 60 years and above have been vaccinated with first dose of vaccine and 17,65,909 with second dose against an estimated target of 44,57,353 people, by September 4. However, the court observed that the statistics enclosed with the affidavits only tell how many people have received both the doses. The two-judge bench of Chief Justice S Muralidhar and Justice B P Routray directed the additional chief secretary department of health and family welfare to file an affidavit indicating how many elderly and differently-abled are yet to receive vaccination and what steps the state envisages in a time-bound manner to cover this population.

---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Few takers for geography; teachers feel NEP may help increase demand||BENGALURU: Vishal Kumar, 19, is pursuing bachelor’s degree in commerce, a subject chosen for him by his parents. Though he says it was heartbreaking in the beginning, it made sense to him as he realised his favourite subject, geography, may not offer promising career opportunities. “I plan to appear for UPSC examination with geography as my optional subject. But taking it as my major would be tough as there are no interesting course options nor career choices,” he said, adding that at least commerce has a set and tested career path. Like Vishal, many students who like geography end up picking other streams due to lack of awareness or opportunities. While students say they are not choosing the subject because there aren’t enough options, college administrations say lack of awareness and promotion has kept demand low. A government college geography lecturer said it is disappointing that there isn’t enough focus on the subject. “Private and government universities must promote the subject just like they promote STEM courses, journalism or psychology,” he said. Meera HN, principal, Seshadripuram College, said there are colleges that offer geography in BA and MA, but the courses are not sought after in urban areas. “The demand for geography is high in northern parts of the state. Employability depends on how students build their skills in that subject,” she said, adding that with NEP, students may get a chance to opt for geography as an elective with other subjects, upping its demand. Bangalore University vice-chancellor Prof KR Venugopal agrees that NEP will help change the traditional nature of the course and make it more relevant by integrating it with technology. “The subject is much more than just an optional for UPSC exams. Opting for it with engineering subjects or with a focus on disaster management will make the subject career-centric,” he opined. ‘Syllabus should be tweaked’D Rajasekhar, director in charge of Institute for Social and Economic Change, Bengaluru, said to make the subject attractive, the syllabus must be altered to suit the present needs, as has been done in foreign universities. “Geography must be taught with developmental studies’ point of view, like geography in relation to social and economic changes,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/few-takers-for-geography-teachers-feel-nep-may-help-increase-demand/articleshow/86052479.cms||Farheen Hussain
---||Hubballi||Karnataka: Man cuts short poll win celebration in Belagavi, rushes to cremate orphan’s body||A man who won the recent elections to Belagavi City Corporation (BCC) cut short the celebration to cremate the body of an orphan and emerged as a role model for many politicians. In the past five years, Shankar Patil, 32, has cremated 500-600 orphaned, unclaimed bodies in and around the city. At the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, he performed the last rites of over 200 deceased. He along with his friends has been providing free cremation service to the poor, especially orphans. As soon as he received a call saying the body of an orphan was found near Kakti, he and his friend left the place where they were celebrating Patil’s election victory. They carried the body in an ambulance to Sadashivanagar crematorium and performed the final rites. Earlier, Patil used to drive an autorickshaw to support his family. Later, with the help of friends, he joined a pharmaceutical company as a medical representative. However, he always wanted to render social service. About five years ago, he came up with the idea of cremating bodies of the underprivileged. Patil told TOI, “We have cremated 500-600 bodies. At present, cremation costs Rs 500 -1,000 and there are many who cannot afford it. Besides, orphans have no one to do their last rites. I was recognised in my ward due to this work. How can I not perform the service just because I won the election?” Patil has two ambulances dedicated for transporting unclaimed bodies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/man-cuts-short-poll-win-celebration-rushes-to-cremate-orphans-body/articleshow/86052482.cms||Basavaraj Meeshi

The proposed new law will replace the existing Drugs & Cosmetics Act, 1940 and will comprehensively address areas like medical devices, hospital equipments, e-pharmacy, emergency use authorisation as well as compensation norms in case of EUAs and clinical trials etc, an official said. The health ministry has constituted a committee to examine the existing law and propose a draft for the new law by November 30. The eight-member panel is headed by the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) with representation from various other state drug regulators and health ministry. “The committee shall undertake prelegislative consultations and examine the present Act, previously framed Drugs & Cosmetics Bills and submit a draft document for a de-novo Drugs, Cosmetics and Medical Devices bill by 30.11.2021,” the health ministry said in its order detailing the terms of reference of the panel. TOI has reviewed the order. Currently, the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 regulates the import, manufacture, distribution and sale of drugs and cosmetics. Through a recent amendment, the law incorporated regulation of medical devices as well. However, the provisions are limited to govern the rapidly expanding segment which has sophisticated and innovative products entering the market. A committee under NITI Aayog had earlier suggested a separate law for regulating medical devices. While the proposed new law is expected to regulate various areas that remain unaddressed in the existing law, the industry is of the view that all stakeholders should be represented in the committee. Medical device manufacturers also urged the government to have a separate law for regulating medical devices, which are different from drugs. “The NITI Aayog 2019 draft of a separate Bill to regulate Devices was in the right direction. Such confusing signals confuse potential investors of medical Devices and India will remain import dependent with one step forward two step backward moves “ Rajiv Nath , Forum Coordinator, AiMeD, which represents local medical device manufacturers.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/new-law-to-regulate-drugs-medical-devices-in-age-of-online-pharmacies/articleshow/86052533.cms||Sushmi Dey
---||World||This case has been going on for a really long time, like to see action: New 9/11 trial judge||GUANTANAMO BAY NAVAL BASE: The new military judge presiding over the September 11 attacks trial in Guantanamo Bay said Wednesday he would not force it toward an end -- but that he wanted to see "action" after nine years of hearings. Air Force Colonel Matthew McCall told the military commissions court at the US navy base in Cuba, that he would not stop lawyers defending 9/11 "architect" Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four others from making their case that the men were denied due process because they were tortured by the CIA.  Speaking just three days before the 20th anniversary of the al-qaeda attacks, he said he wanted to move through the long-running pretrial phase of a death penalty case that has already gone through seven judges.  "This case has been going on for a really long time," he told the attorneys, defendants, and family members of the 9/11 victims at the courtroom.  "I feel no pressure to get this case to trial," he said, amid defence concerns of political interference.  Nevertheless, he said, "I would like to see action," to move things ahead.  The second day of hearings after an 18-month break due to the Covid-19 pandemic focused on a review of the judge's own potential biases.  Gary Sowards, one of Mohammed's attorneys, pressed McCall on his personal reaction to the September 11, 2001 attacks, his experience reviewing detainees in Iraq, and his view of the issues surrounding the high-security trial of the five.  "This is a political trial," said Sowards, saying the government has used its power to mask the CIA's torture of the five men at secret "black sites" before they arrived at Guantanamo in 2006.  "The effects of torture are always in the room," he said.  "Their big trump card is national security and state secrets," he said of the military prosecutors.  Mohammed and alleged co-conspirators Ammar al-Baluchi, Walid bin Attash, Ramzi bin al-Shibh and Mustafa al-Hawsawi, who were all in the courtroom for the second day, are accused of terrorism and mass murder of 2,976 people in the attacks.  - 'Valid option' - Defense attorneys challenged McCall over his view of Islam after he said he read books by Middle East historian Bernard Lewis before he deployed to Iraq in the early 2000s.  Lewis, who wrote of the "Clash of Civilizations," became controversial for encouraging the administration of George W. Bush to invade Iraq in hopes of resetting the course of history and society in the Arab world.  McCall said he did not hold the same views.  "I don't think you can look at Islam as one big block," he said.  All religions have their moderates and extremists, he added.  "I try to read different sources of news," he insisted, adding is considers himself "fairly open-minded."  He said as a military attorney he had worked in Iraq in the 2000s reviewing cases of detainees before they were placed into the Iraqi justice system.  Most were guilty of nothing serious and deserved release, he said.  But he said he was not responsible for some who the Iraqis put to death, and others who remained in detention despite no evidence against them.  He called the death penalty "a valid option" in the 9/11 case.  He added that, given the number of death row inmates who have been shown to be innocent in the United States, a sentence of execution demands a "higher standard" of proof.  McCall closed Wednesday's hearing in the afternoon, scheduling Thursday for private conferences, and planned to complete the review of his own qualifications on Friday.  He plans to turn the court to substantive issues next week.  The defence has readied scores of motions to obtain classified evidence supporting their arguments that the prosecution's case is tainted by the lasting effects of torture.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/rest-of-world/this-case-has-been-going-on-a-really-long-time-like-to-see-action-new-9/11-trial-judge/articleshow/86052909.cms||---

---||India||New Hurriyat chief in Tihar is Pakistan’s poster boy||NEW DELHI: The naming of Masarat Alam, lodged in Tihar jail as an undertrial in an NIA terror funding case, as the next chief of the All Parties Hurriyat Conference is clearly an attempt by ISI masterminds to give prominence to hardline and pro-Pakistan voices within the separatist umbrella outfit and in J&K in general. However, the assessment within the Indian security establishment is that with Alam incarcerated in New Delhi, his appointment at the Hurriyat helm is only a symbolic move meant to enthuse pro-Pakistan elements in Kashmir, and may not have any immediate impact on the ground in terms of revival of protests or hartals. “The choice of Alam for heading Hurriyat has the stamp of Pakistan and ISI. Pakistan clearly wants friendly, hardline voices to gain traction in Kashmir. But even though Alam will head Hurriyat, his writ is unlikely to run in the UT as he is in a Delhi jail miles away from Kashmir. We believe the encouraging effect that Masarat’s new status will have on the ‘hardliners’ and Hurriyat cadres in J&K may at best be temporary. We don’t see any immediate impact on the security situation in J&K, but remain watchful of any likely attempt by Pakistan to foment fresh trouble in J&K, using Geelani’s death and quick burial as a trigger,” an officer of the Central security establishment told TOI on Wednesday. “As of now, most of the Hurriyat leadership, either arrested or under the lens for terror funding, is quiet,” said an officer. On reports in a section of the media hinting at a move to ban Hurriyat under UAPA, the official said while the Act empowers the Centre to proscribe any outfit involved in terror funding, the pros and cons of the action have to be weighed. “Hurriyat is currently down and out, and a ban may only bring it back into relevance,” reasoned an official. A top leader of the Muslim League, Masarat Alam was the prime mover and motivator behind the stone-pelting protests in Kashmir in 2010 and also linked to the cycle of violent protests and hartals that followed the killing of Hizbul terrorist Burhan Wani in 2016. Masarat was taken into detention under the J&K Public Safety Act (PSA) in 2010, but freed in 2015 after the J&K HC quashed his PSA detention. He was however re-arrested soon after in an NIA terror funding case and chargesheeted as an accused in the same case in 2019.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/new-hurriyat-chief-in-tihar-is-pakistans-poster-boy/articleshow/86052559.cms||Bharti Jain
---||Business||Finally, India gets lead agency for road safety||NEW DELHI: Finally, the government has notified the constitution of the National Road Safety Board, which will function as the lead agency at national level to deal with matters relating to road safety. The notification issued by the road transport and highways ministry this week for National Road Safety Board (NRSB) is aimed at integrating efforts in collaboration with states to reduce road crashes and improve all aspects of safety. The provision for establishing the board with experts from different fields was provisioned in the Motor Vehicle Amendment Act of 2019. Several countries across the world including the United States, Sweden and Australia have lead agencies at national level. The transport ministry’s notification specifies that the board will have an advisory role to come up with recommendations and proposals for the central government, which include formulation of specific standards for road safety, traffic management and road construction for hilly regions in the country. It can also provide technical advice and assistance to the central and state governments and local authorities on administration of road safety and traffic management. The board can also specify guidelines for establishing and operating trauma facilities and paramedical facilities for dealing with traffic related injuries on roads. The proposal for an apex board at the national level was first mooted in 2007 in the Sundar Committee report. The panel was formed to present a note to the Empowered Committee of Secretaries for the creation of a Directorate of Road Safety and Traffic Management and required the amendment of traffic laws as required. In January 2005, the Cabinet Committee on Infrastructure headed by then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had directed the road transport ministry to present a note prepared by a specialised panel. According to the notification, the board will have a chairman, members and technical committees under experts to deal with different aspects of road safety including vehicle engineering, data collection and crash investigation. The board will have officials from the road transport ministry and state governments who will be the ex-officio members. The chairman and members will be appointed by the central government after recommendation by a search-cum-selection committee under the chairmanship of the Union road transport secretary. Such persons must have special knowledge of or professional experience in administration, road safety, urban planning, law, traffic management and regulation, health and advocacy, enforcement and investigation, transport engineering, insurance, automobile engineering, civil engineering and public transport. The Sundar Committee had recommended that the broad-based selection committee comprising the cabinet secretary and secretary from road transport and DGs of health services and CSIR should draw up a panel from which the appointments would be made. “A broad-based selection committee and a transparent selection process are necessary to ensure that the best talent available both from within the government and the market is recruited,” it had said. Welcoming the notification, Dr H S Chhabra, president of Spinal Cord Society said, “The constitution of National Road Safety Board, which will function as the lead agency at national level to deal with matters relating to road safety, is a very welcome and long awaited step. It is heartening that the notification came on the sixth day of the Injury Prevention Week which was commemorated for the first time from September 1-7. Experts have always demanded the need for an integrated multi-sectoral approach at Centre and state level with a nodal agency with appropriate authority and budget.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/finally-india-gets-lead-agency-for-road-safety/articleshow/86052568.cms||Dipak K Dash

As part of the agreement reached between the government of India and NSCN (K) Niki Group, more than 200 cadres of the latter joined the peace process along with 83 weapons. The pact came into effect on Wednesday and shall be in force for one year. A home ministry release on Wednesday said the signing of ceasefire agreement with NSCN(K) Niki Group “fulfills the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi of an insurgency-free and prosperous northeast” and stands to “significantly boost the Naga peace process under the guidance of Union Minister of home affairs and cooperation Amit Shah”. Niki Sumi, a native of Assam who was military operations chief of NSCN(K) at the time of Chandel ambush and had a Rs 10-lakh reward declared on him by NIA, had broken away from NSCN(Khaplang) after its founder and chief S S Khaplang’s death in 2017. He volunteered in December 2020 to revive the ceasefire that the NSCN(K) had unilaterally abrogated in 2015, an offer that the Centre decided to take up since Sumi commanded units with a significant number of armed cadres. The purpose, sources told TOI, is to isolate NSCN(K) – banned in 2015 under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act -- by accepting surrender of cadres belonging to its breakaway factions and making them part of the Naga peace process. While the Centre has already signed a framework agreement with NSCN(Isak-Muivah), with which it has been in a truce since 1997, it has also entered into with ceasefire agreements with other Naga groups, namely NSCN (NK), NSCN® and NSCN(K)-Khango. The fate of the NIA case against Sumi was not immediately known. As part of its efforts to make northeast insurgency-free, Centre had signed an agreement with NLFT(SD) in August 2019, under which 88 cadres along with 44 weapons joined the mainstream in Tripura. In January 2020, with the signing of the Bodo agreement, more than 2,250 cadres of insurgent groups, including all factions of NDFB, along with 423 weapons surrendered in Assam. On February 23, 2021, 1,040 leaders and cadres of various underground Karbi groups of Assam surrendered along with 338 weapons and it was followed by the signing of the Karbi Anglong agreement on September 4, 2021.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/government-inks-peace-pact-with-nscn-faction-200-ultras-surrender/articleshow/86052605.cms||Bharti Jain

The National Statistical Survey Organization (NSSO) report released in January says the literacy rate among males in the survey year (2017 and 2018) was 80.08%, while for females it was 57.6%. The literacy rate of females in the state is the second-worst in the country. The census data of 2001 and 2011 says literacy levels in the state have jumped from 60.40% to 66.11%. Women have registered a major jump from 43.90% to 52.12% while men have recorded a slight rise from 75.70% to 79.19% in the same duration. Times ViewThis is alarming news, particularly since education of women is directly linked to development of children. It is for sure a long haul, but the state government must make it a mission to reduce gender disparity on this front.“The major concern here is the huge gender gap at the level where we are assessing people on simple reading, writing and maths. It is evident that girls are facing discrimination when it comes to education right from primary level. It has come at a time when governments have moved to the next level and working hard on improving the gross enrolment ratio of females in schools, colleges and universities,” said Rashmi Jain, head of the sociology department, Rajasthan University. The 2011 Census figures say female literacy was worst in Jalore and Sirohi with 38.47% and 39.73%, respectively. The worst performing block for the same reason was Kotra in Tonk with a 16.49% literacy rate of females.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/at-23-rajasthan-has-biggest-gender-divide-in-literacy/articleshow/86052635.cms||---

He was among the four district judges whose names were returned by the Centre after a delay of months to the SC Collegium for reconsideration. By the time the SC Collegium decided to reiterate all the four names, one among them was so close to retirement, that his name was dropped perforce in the reiterated recommendation. The Union government sat over the February recommendations for four names, which were part of the 11 district judges recommended for appointment as HC judges, for months and sent it back to the Collegium last month for reconsideration. As is the general norm, the District Judges retire at the age of 60 years and are considered for appointment as HC judges when they enter the age bracket of 58-60, giving them between four to two years as HC judges, who superannuate at the age of 62 years. Though the SC Collegium headed by CJI N V Ramana and comprising Justices U U Lalit and A M Khanwilkar took up the returned names expeditiously and were unanimous in their view to reiterate all the four names, it was left with no option but to drop the name of Anil Kumar Gupta, district judge of Jalaun at Orai, from reiteration as Gupta, even if appointed as a HC judge immediately by the Centre following reiteration, would have had a short tenure of just four months. However, the Collegium reiterated the recommendation regarding Varanasi district Judge Om Prakash Tripathi, Etawah district judge Umesh Chandra Sharma and Amroha district judge Syed Waiz Mian for their appointment as Allahabad HC Judges. Once the names are reiterated by the Collegium, it is generally accepted by the Centre. On February 4 this year, the Collegium comprising then CJI S A Bobde and Justices N V Ramana and R F Nariman had recommended names of 11 district judges - Mohd Aslam, Anil Kumar Gupta, Anil Kumar Ojha, Sadhna Rani (Thakur), Om Prakash Tripathi, Naveen Srivastava, Umesh Chandra Sharma, Syed Aftab Husain Rizvi, Ajai Tyagi, Syed Waiz Mian, and Ajai Kumar Srivastava-I - for appointment as HC judges. While the President appointed seven of them as Allahabad HC Judges, the government returned the names of Anil Kumar Gupta, Om Prakash Tripathi, Umesh Chandra Sharma and Syed Waiz Mian in August to the Collegium for reconsideration. The present Collegium headed by CJI Ramana on August 24 reiterated the names of Tripathi, Sharma and Mian but was left with no option but to drop Gupta's name from the reiterated recommendation. Even if his name were reiterated and the government expeditiously appointed him, Gupta, with 35 years in judicial service, would have retired as a HC judge on January 24, 2022, giving him just four months tenure. The Collegium felt Gupta lost out in becoming a HC judge because of long delay in the government acting on the February recommendation. If the government gives effect to the SC's reiterated recommendation and appoints them as HC judges, Varanasi district judge Om Prakash Tripathi would have a tenure of nearly three years; Etawah district judge Umesh Chandra Sharma would have a tenure of two and half years and Amroha district Judge Syed Waiz Mian would get one and half years tenure.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/justice-denied-to-a-judge-as-govt-sits-on-elevation-to-hc/articleshow/86052675.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||India||Supreme Court takes 12 years to decide a 54-year-old land dispute||NEW DELHI: In a case exemplifying what snail-paced justice dispensation can mean to litigants, the Supreme Court on Wednesday decided a 54 year-old land dispute and gave title to the heirs of a doctor who had constructed his tenement over a 500 square yard land, ostensibly gifted to him by the erstwhile owners. Both the main plaintiff and defendant passed away during the pendency of the litigation, which started with the land owner attempting to reclaim the land from the doctor by filing a title suit before the Sitamarhi trial court in 1967. The trial court took 19 years to dismiss the title suit, which prompted the plaintiff claiming ownership over the small land (six Kathas) to appeal before the additional district judge, Sitamarhi, who reversed the trial court order in 1988. The legal heirs of the doctor moved the Patna HC, where a single judge dismissed the appeal in May 1989. The appeal filed against the HC order took 11 years to be decided by the SC, which in the year 2000 remanded the matter back to the HC for de novo consideration owing to intricacies of land law involved in the case. The HC single judge again considered the matter and nine years later dismissed the appeals of the doctor's heirs. The single judge also dismissed the review plea in August 2009. The appeals were filed in the SC again in 2009 and it had issued notice on the appeal to respondents in December 2009. After nearly 12 years, a bench of Justices A M Khanwilkar and Sanjiv Khanna on Wednesday drew curtains on the more than half a century-old litigation by upholding the doctor's ownership over the land through gift and allowed the doctor's heirs to enjoy the property. But, the underlying agony of litigants, who spent considerable time and money in litigation, did not find mention in the 19-page judgment delivered by the bench. Like the doctor's heirs and the descendants of the plaintiff, who had filed the title suit in 1967, there are lakhs who are suffering the injurious pinch of both the cost and time of litigation. According to the National Judicial Data Grid, more than 1 lakh cases are pending in the three-tier justice dispensation system for over 30 years. Another 4.85 lakh cases are pending for a period ranging between 20-30 years. The cases which have been swelling the dockets of trial courts for a period between 10-20 years are over 27 lakh and another 60 lakh cases are pending for a period of 5-10 years. Alarmingly, over 4.3 lakh criminal cases are pending in trial courts, HCs and SC for more than 20 years.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/supreme-court-takes-12-years-to-decide-a-54-year-old-land-dispute/articleshow/86052683.cms||Dhananjay Mahapatra
---||India||If Pak dares interfere in India’s internal matters, it will be given befitting reply again: J&K ex-DyCM||JAMMU: A day after Jammu and Kashmir lieutenant general Manoj Sinha launched an online portal for resolving the issues of Kashmiri migrants’ property in the Valley, former deputy chief minister of the erstwhile J&K state Kavinder Gupta on Wednesday said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has a strong resolve towards Kashmiri Pandits’ resettlement.  The senior BJP leader also warned that Pakistan will be given a befitting reply if it dares interfere in the internal matters of India, especially with regards to Kashmir.  “The BJP government (at the Centre) has taught Pakistan a lesson of a lifetime by air strikes and surgical strikes. But if the ‘rogue nation’ does not mend its ways, there is every chance that once again it will be given a befitting reply so that it never dares to interfere in the internal matters of India, especially with regards to Kashmir,” a press statement issued by Gupta stated.  At the same time, Gupta hit out at the then governments, both at the centre and in the erstwhile state, which did nothing to stop the situation from escalating in 1990s when the Kashmiri Pandits were forced to become “refugees in their own country”.  “The present central dispensation, led by PM Narendra Modi is treading gradually to undo all the mistakes committed by successive governments in the last 70 years in Jammu and Kashmir, besides being committed to the dignified return of the Kashmiri Pandits to the Valley,” he said.  He added the biggest achievement for which the government is toiling hard these days is the safe and dignified return of Kashmiri Pandits to their homeland Kashmir. “Much has been done already in this direction with lieutenant general Manoj Sinha launching an online portal for resolving the issues of Kashmiri migrants’ property in the Valley yesterday,” said the BJP leader.  He further said that this landmark feat of the BJP government is just the start as the next step of ensuring safe return of the Kashmiri Pandits to their motherland is the top priority.  “The BJP government has already took revolutionary steps in J&K like abrogation of Article 370 and making J&K a Union territory, thus neutralising the effect of entities, which under the guise of mainstream politics, wanted to destabilise the country by supporting separatism and violence,” he said in a veiled attack on the Valley-based mainstream parties.  The BJP leader also hoped that soon the pristine glory of the ‘Paradise on the Earth’ will be restored and the region will again become the first choice of tourists and travellers from across the world.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/if-pak-dares-interfere-in-indias-internal-matters-it-will-be-given-befitting-reply-again-jk-ex-dycm/articleshow/86052684.cms||Sanjay Khajuria

Cathy Russell, director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office, sent letters to 18 people named to the boards of visitors for the Air Force Academy, Military Academy and Naval Academy calling on them to resign by close of business on Wednesday or they would be terminated. Among those Biden sought to remove are some high-profile former Trump administration officials, including White House counselor Kellyanne Conway (Air Force Academy), press secretary Sean Spicer (Naval Academy), national security adviser H.R. McMaster (US Military Academy) and Office of Management and Budget director Russell Vought (Naval Academy). White House press secretary Jen Psaki confirmed that the former Trump officials were asked to resign or face firing. ``I will let others evaluate whether they think Kellyanne Conway and Sean Spicer and others were qualified, or not political, to serve on these boards,'' Psaki said. ``But the president's qualification requirements are not your party registration. They are whether you're qualified to serve and whether you are aligned with the values of this administration.'' Several of those called on to resign pushed back. Conway jabbed at Biden, ``I'm not resigning but you should.'' She went on in a statement to call it a ``disappointing but understandable'' effort to distract from the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan, a rise in COVID cases and a disappointing August jobs report. Vought on Twitter posted the letter he received from Russell and responded, ``No. It's a three year term.'' Jonathan Hiler, a Navy academy alumnus who served as director of legislative affairs for Vice President Mike Pence, said he was ``not resigning.'' ``As an alum and former naval officer, I believe developing leaders capable of defending our country's interests at sea--USNA's mission--is not something that should be consumed by partisan politics. Apparently, President Biden feels differently. (at)WhiteHouse,'' Hiler posted on Twitter. Spicer, who now works for the conservative news channel Newsmax, in his own social media posting criticized Biden for trying to terminate Trump appointees, ``Instead of focusing on the stranded Americans left in (hash)Afghanistan.''||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/biden-moves-to-oust-trump-military-academy-board-appointees/articleshow/86052722.cms||---
---||Delhi||Delhi HC asks CBI to probe Ankit Gujjar’s death in Tihar||NEW DELHI: Pointing out that a life was lost “to custodial violence” amid allegations of extortion by jail officials, the Delhi high court on Wednesday transferred to the CBI the probe into the alleged murder of gangster Ankit Gujjar, who was lodged in Tihar. Justice Mukta Gupta took a grim view of allegations by Gujjar’s family that he was beaten up because of failure to pay a senior jail official. This, coupled with the fact that the jail doctor who examined Gujjar’s injuries, which were serious, failed to raise an alarm even as the jail staff prevented a Delhi Police PCR cop from taking the inmate’s statement before death, convinced the court that the CBI needed to be brought in. The HC sought a status report on the probe before October 28. Gujjar’s death: Court calls for probe into role of jail docs too Walls of prison, howsoever high they may be, the foundation of a prison is laid on the Rule of Law ensuring the rights to its inmates enshrined in the Constitution of India. It is the violation of these constitutional rights of Ankit Gujjar, who lost his life to custodial violence in Tihar Jail, which has compelled petitioners Geeta, Shivani and Ankul, mother, sister and brother of deceased Ankit Gujjar (respectively), to file the present writ petition,” the judge observed while directing that the case file be handed over by Delhi Police to the CBI. The HC observed that if the allegations of extortion in the prison are correct, “it is a very serious offence which requires in-depth investigation”. It pointed out that even as the family has also provided the numbers of the accounts to which the money was transferred, “the entire investigation, as is evident from the proceedings noted in the FIR as also the status report filed, is aimed to show that since there was recovery of a mobile phone, charger and knife from the cell of the deceased, he was being transferred, and when he refused to be transferred, a scuffle took place, ignoring the genesis of the occurrence that there was demand of money from Narender Meena which was not fulfilled due to which Ankit was mercilessly beaten”. Justice Gupta also underlined that the post-mortem “belies the version” of the jail officials that a scuffle took place in which both the deputy superintendent and Gujjar received injuries. The HC said it is “unfathomable” why the jail doctor failed to spot the multiple injuries, adding that an investigation was needed into not only the offence of brutal beating of Gujjar but also into “the role of jail doctors in not providing proper treatment at the right time”. The court also flagged the “connivance/laxity” of the jail deputy superintendent, who did not permit local police to go inside the jail to inquire into the PCR call made in relation to the beating of Gujjar on the intervening night of August 3-4. It stressed the need for “immediate remedial actions” to ensure “unscrupulous officers” do not take advantage of non-functional CCTVs and asked the director general (prisons) to streamline the CCTV system in jail and file a report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-asks-cbi-to-probegujjars-death-in-tihar/articleshow/86052824.cms||Abhinav Garg

"The Secretary's trip to Saudi Arabia has been postponed due to scheduling issues. He looks forward to rescheduling at the soonest opportunity," a defense department official told AFP. Austin traveled to the Gulf region earlier this week, a week after the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan ended. He first went to Doha with Secretary of State Antony Blinken to visit the main base for the massive airlift set up by the United States out of Kabul. The United States and its allies evacuated some 123,000 people, mostly Afghans who fear Taliban retribution, in the final days of the 20-year US war that President Joe Biden ended last month. Austin then traveled to Kuwait, where he met Wednesday with the country's leaders. He thanked them for their "critical role" in supporting the evacuations from Afghanistan, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said. Austin is also due to travel to Bahrain.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/us-defense-secretary-postpones-visit-to-saudi-arabia/articleshow/86052848.cms||---

On Tuesday, the Visvesvaraya Technological University sought government nod to start the course which is in sync with the new National Education Policy (NEP). The 4-year BSc (Hons) programme will have Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Maths (STEAM) subjects. The science and engineering departments will conduct classes on campus and each college can have 60 students per course. “This course will be different from those in degree colleges given the emphasis on STEM subjects. The open electives, project work and internship will be STEM-centric and from engineering background,” said vice-chancellor Karisiddappa. Proposal to choose students through CET The open electives, project work and internship will be STEM-centric and from engineering background like Artificial Intelligence, cybersecurity and Internet of Things, among others. It’ll be like courses offered in the Indian Institute of Science and other premier technological institutions,” said vice-chancellor Karisidappa.  There is a proposal to select students through the Common Entrance Test. Engineering colleges offering this programme will be chosen based on NAAC and NBA accreditation and Local Inspection Committee reports. With government colleges not having NBA accreditation, they’re unlikely to offer the course this year. “As most engineering colleges have placement cells, students can benefit from them,” the VC said. While admission to all BSc programmes in most colleges is over, VTU hopes its course will enthuse those keen to join. “Some students passionate about STEM subjects may want to join an engineering college. Others may prefer pure sciences over engineering. The number of students completing PU course is higher than last year because of the all-promotion policy. The increase in seats will benefit them,” Karisidappa said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/60-engg-colleges-in-karnataka-to-offer-4-yr-bsc-course-this-yr/articleshow/86053024.cms||Sruthy Susan Ullas
---||Bengaluru||Bengaluru: Shopper jumps queue, slaps woman for raising objection||BENGALURU: A 38-year-old woman shopping in a supermarket in BTM Layout II Stage, south Bengaluru, was allegedly bashed up by a 45-year-old man after she objected to him jumping the queue at the billing counter on Sunday morning. Kishore Kumar, 46, resident of BTM Layout I Stage, was arrested from the supermarket after staffers alerted Mico Layout police. Police said Kumar worked in a private firm before quitting the job. He was released on bail on Tuesday. Trouble began around 8am when the accused tried to jump the queue and the woman objected to it. Since it was a Sunday morning, a large crowd had gathered inside the supermarket and staff at the billing counters had requested customers to stand in boxes marked to ensure social distancing. However, Kumar tried to jump the queue bypassing three women and two men who were ahead of him. One of the women raised an objection to Kumar’s conduct. Other customers too joined her and asked him to stand in the queue. By then, Kumar began abusing the woman. Though she warned him to mind his words, Kumar continued his tirade. “I wanted to record his abuses and pulled out my iPhone. I raised my hand to record him when he suddenly hit me on my hand. My iPhone fell and I shouted for help. Then he slapped me on my face and dragged me down, holding my hair. I fell on a vegetable basket,” the woman told cops. Customers and supermarket staff rushed to the woman’s help, while some men grabbed Kumar and held him. “Kumar continued to abuse me and tried to attack me again,” the woman, a private company employee, stated in her complaint. Based on the complaint, police booked Kumar under IPC sections 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of Rs 50 or more), 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) and 354 (assault or criminal force to a woman with intent to outrage modesty).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/shopper-jumps-queue-slapswoman-for-raising-objection/articleshow/86046829.cms||---
---||World||Ida curfew lifted in New Orleans; 11 new deaths reported||HOUMA: New Orleans lifted a nightly curfew Wednesday as the city moved closer to regaining full power 10 days after Hurricane Ida, but hundreds of thousands of people outside the city were still without lights and water and more than a quarter of a million children were unable to return to schools. The city was left completely in the dark when Hurricane Ida slammed into the Louisiana coast with 150 mph (240 mph) winds on Aug. 29, cutting power to more than a million people statewide. Two days later, New Orleans Police and Mayor LaToya Cantrell imposed an 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew, citing cases of theft and other minor crime. They withdrew the order Wednesday morning but the police department said in a statement that it would maintain ``increased and focused patrols throughout the city.'' Meanwhile, officials raised the state's death toll from Ida to 26 on Wednesday, with the additional 11 deaths all occurring in the city of New Orleans. The deaths happened between Aug. 30 and Monday, but were just confirmed as storm-related by the Orleans Parish coroner, the state health department said. Nine of the New Orleans deaths came from ``excessive heat during an extended power outage,'' according to the health department. The remaining two deaths involved carbon monoxide poisoning. The heat-related deaths involved people ages 64 to 79, the department said. Also Wednesday, state Superintendent of Education Cade Brumley noted that 250,000 students were still unable to attend class because of the hurricane. Prior to Ida, schools around Louisiana had been open despite widespread cases of COVID-19, although under a statewide mask mandate for all indoor locations. ``We need to get those kids back with us as soon as we possibly can,'' Brumley said. In New Orleans, School Superintendent Henderson Lewis Jr. said damage to schools appeared to be mostly minimal, but that power needs to be restored to all buildings, and teachers, staff and families need to return to the city. ``Now more than ever, our children stand to benefit from the comfort that structured and routine daily schooling can bring,'' Lewis said in a statement Wednesday. ``So, let's all come together to reopen our schools quickly and safely.'' Lewis said he expects classes for some will resume as early as next week and that all students will be back a week after that. No school reopening estimates have been provided for the five parishes that were hardest hit by Hurricane Ida and which are home to about 320,000 people: Terrebonne, Lafourche, St. James, St. Charles and St. John the Baptist. Ten days after the hurricane, 96% of utility customers in those parishes are still without power. In the Terrebonne Parish city of Houma, bucket trucks with linemen were on every street and as the day progressed there were signs of progress _ street lights began working on busy Grand Caillou road by early afternoon. Even as power was coming on in parts of Terrebonne Parish, it was of limited use to Coy Verdin. The 52-year-old fisherman was staying at his son's house in Houma. His own bayou-side home was all but destroyed in the storm. ``All the ceilings fell. You can see daylight through the roof,'' Verdin said. ``All we have is basically a shell.'' Ida scattered most of his 200 crab traps to parts unknown. ``The only thing I have left is my boat and some of my commercial fishing rigging,'' he said. The St. John the Baptist Parish School System website states that all schools and offices will be closed ``until further notification`` as officials inspect the buildings. Lafourche Parish Schools Superintendent Jarod Martin indicated a ``long and extensive road to recovery'' on that school system's website, with no timeline for a return in sight. Statewide, crews have now restored power to 600,000 of the 902,000 who lost electricity at the peak of Hurricane Ida, Entergy Louisiana President and CEO Phillip May said on a Wednesday conference call with reporters. Meanwhile in New Orleans, the power company expected to have 90% of the city back online by Wednesday evening, said Entergy New Orleans President and CEO Deanna Rodriguez. ``The greater New Orleans area is coming back to life,'' Rodriguez said. May cautioned that some people who get power back on could still lose it at some point in coming days. That's because the tree canopy was left severely damaged by Ida, and damaged limbs and branches still in trees could be shaken loose and fall. Access to fuel was still dire Wednesday, with the website GasBuddy.com reporting about 48% of gas stations in Baton Rouge had no gasoline. About 56% of stations in New Orleans were also dry. About 62,000 people were still without running water in Louisiana, the state health department reported. That's significantly lower than the hundreds of thousands of people who had no water immediately after Ida's landfall. Still, more than 580,000 people were being told to boil their water for safety. In many neighborhoods, homes remain uninhabitable. About 3,200 people are in mass shelters around Louisiana while another 25,000 people whose houses have been damaged are staying in hotel rooms through the Federal Emergency Management Agency's transitional sheltering program. Ida's death toll in Louisiana rose to 15 people Tuesday after the state Department of Health reported two additional storm-related fatalities: a 68-year-old man who fell off of a roof while making repairs to damage caused by Hurricane Ida and a 71-year-old man who died of a lack of oxygen during an extended power outage. The storm's remnants also brought historic flooding, record rains and tornados from Virginia to Massachusetts, killing at least 50 more people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/ida-curfew-lifted-in-new-orleans-11-new-deaths-reported/articleshow/86053018.cms||---
---||World||Blinken says Taliban legitimacy will have to be 'earned'||RAMSTEIN: US Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned Wednesday that the Taliban would have to earn legitimacy from the world, after talks with allies on how to present a united front to the hardline new government in Afghanistan. "The Taliban seek international legitimacy. Any legitimacy -- any support -- will have to be earned," Blinken told reporters at the US air base in Ramstein, Germany, after leading a 20-nation ministerial virtual meeting on the Afghan crisis. A senior State Department official said all countries were broadly on the same page on dealing with the Taliban caretaker government -- including Pakistan, historically the insurgents' ally. "Pakistan was there. They talked about their unique role, from their perspective... they certainly said that we're in a position where we have to engage to some degree," the official told reporters on Blinken's plane. "But nothing along the lines of, we think we have to recognise or legitimise the government in the near term," he said. The official said Washington has had no contact, even indirectly, with another key neighbour, Iran, on Afghanistan. Iran has historically opposed the Taliban but developed relations as the United States, Tehran's arch-nemesis, carried out its withdrawal. Pakistan's Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi tweeted: "We must not allow creation of a political vacuum in Afghanistan leading to insecurity and instability. "A stable & peaceful Afghanistan only be achieved through more, not less, regional & int'l engagement. "Pakistan, as an immediate neighbour cannot afford to disengage," he said. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas noted the international community expected the Taliban to uphold human rights, including those of women, grant access to humanitarian aid and allow those wishing to leave the country to do so. Maas said he believed Wednesday's talks were "the starting point for international coordination" on how to deal with the Taliban. Blinken and Maas both criticised the caretaker government announced in Afghanistan on Tuesday, which has no women or non-Taliban members and includes an interior minister the United States wants to arrest on terrorism accusations. Blinken said the caretaker cabinet would be judged "by its actions". Blinken's stop in Ramstein was his second base visit in as many days, after he visited Qatar on Tuesday. Thanks were offered thanks to US civilian and military officials behind one of history's largest airlifts after Afghanistan fell to the Taliban. At the entrance to a vast hangar where some of the 11,000 Afghans at Ramstein await flights to the United States, Blinken showed photos on his telephone of his own children to the four-year-old son of Mustafa Mohammadi, an Afghan military veteran turned refugee who worked with the US embassy. The stepson of a Holocaust survivor and longtime advocate for refugees, Blinken also toured a makeshift home for some of the children who have lost their parents. "Many, many, many Americans are really looking forward to welcoming you and having you come to the United States," he said. Hanging on the walls were artwork by children, including a picture of a girl on a cliff beneath a deep-blue sky with a broken heart and a message in English, "Say to my Mom I miss you." The United States and its allies evacuated some 123,000 people, mostly Afghans who fear Taliban retribution, in the final days of the 20-year US war that President Joe Biden ended last month. But US officials acknowledge that many more remain and say the Taliban have agreed to let them leave. Blinken vowed to press the Taliban to allow charter flights out of Afghanistan after criticism the US administration was not doing enough to help those still stranded. "We are working to do everything in our power to support those flights and to get them off the ground," Blinken said. Germany, like many US allies, had celebrated Biden's victory over Donald Trump and the new administration's stated emphasis on working with the rest of the world. But even some close allies have been critical over how Biden ended the 20-year war in Afghanistan, which led to the Western-backed government crumbling within days. Armin Laschet, the leader of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's ruling party and candidate to succeed her, described the Afghanistan mission as "the biggest debacle" in NATO's history. Biden has long favoured pulling out of Afghanistan, arguing the US-led NATO mission had achieved its core goal of accountability for the September 11 attacks 20 years ago this week.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/blinken-says-taliban-legitimacy-will-have-to-be-earned/articleshow/86053302.cms||---

---||Bhubaneswar||Odisha: BJD suspends Chilika MLA Prashanta Kumar Jagadev for ‘assaulting’ BJP leader||BHUBANESWAR: The BJD on Wednesday suspended its Chilika MLA Prashanta Kumar Jagadev hours after the Balugaon police in Khurda district registered a case against him for allegedly assaulting a local BJP leader. Chief minister Naveen Patnaik has also removed Jagadev from the post of chairperson of Khurda district planning committee. The prompt action against Jagadev followed after a video, showing his unruly conduct towards BJP leader Niranjan Sethy in full public view, went viral. Sethy is BJP’s Balugaon town president. “Shri Prashanta Kumar Jagadev, MLA, Chilika assembly constituency, is hereby suspended from Biju Janata Dal with immediate effect,” read the office order signed by BJD president and chief minister Naveen Patnaik. The Balugaon police have booked Jagadev under Sections 341 (wrongful restraint), 294 (obscene acts), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 34 (act done by several persons with common intention) of the IPC and Section 3 (1r)/3(1s) of SC/ST (prevention of atrocities) Act. “We have registered a case and are investigating the matter. The charges are being examined,” Balugaon sub-divisional police officer (SDPO) Manas Ranjan Barik told TOI. Jagadev (52), a two-time BJD MLA, is infamous for his frequent run-ins in public places. On November 3, 2016, Jagadev, who was then the Begunia MLA, was booked for allegedly abusing former Bolagada tehsildar Niharika Nayak, an Odisha administrative service (OAS) officer. The party, which was believed to have warned Jagadev in the past, showed zero tolerance against him this time around. In the latest case, Jagadev allegedly attacked Sethy following an altercation between them over distribution of land pattas in the area on Wednesday. “I had gone to the local notified area council office and inquired about the delay in distribution of old-age pensions to the beneficiaries. When I was returning, I saw Jagadev distributing land pattas to some people. When I told him that such a practice should have been conducted by government officials, he hurled abuses and attacked me,” Sethy said. Jagadev was unavailable for comment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/bjd-suspends-chilika-mla-jagadev-for-assaulting-bjp-leader/articleshow/86044751.cms||Debabrata Mohapatra

The jail authorities have also been advised to keep inmates with suicidal tendencies under CCTV surveillance. Instances have come to the notice that some prisoners committed suicides in the past by hanging in the cells, toilets or isolated places. Such unnatural incidents put question mark on the security arrangement and alertness of the duty staff. Preventive measures could have been taken to protect their lives, said a 16-point circular sent by the director general (prisons and correctional services) Santosh Kumar Upadhyay to all jail authorities on Wednesday. According to his order, all wells inside the jail should be fenced with grated doors and locks. Prisoners will not be engaged inside any well for any purpose. The cells or isolation wards shall be properly searched and appliances or articles that may facilitate suicides should be removed. All sky-lights in the cells, isolation wards and all windows should be protected by a mesh of wire gauze to prevent the prisoners from using the bars to commit suicide. Knives and other tools used in work sheds, kitchen and the equipment used by barbers or tailors in the prisons should be counted and locked by the warders every day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/rules-laid-down-to-prevent-inmate-suicides-in-jails/articleshow/86044758.cms||Debabrata Mohapatra
---||World||Taliban put 'conditions' to restrict protest in Afghanistan||KABUL: The Taliban on Wednesday introduced several 'conditions' to restrict protest in Afghanistan after forming a new government in the country. These conditions include taking permission from the Ministry of Justice while purpose, slogans, place, time and all 'other' details of the protest need to be shared with the government authorities, as reported by Pajhwok News. Details of the protest need to be shared with the security agencies 24-hours prior to the protest. The developments came amid an increase in the protests against the Taliban in the country. Earlier on Wednesday, residents of Faizabad took to the streets to support the resistance in their fight against the Taliban. On September 7, a group of women also held a protest in Balkh province calling to preserve the achievements of the past 20 years and demanding women's representation in the future government in Afghanistan. Similar protests were also held in Kabul, Parwan and Badakhshan province. These protests are being held majorly by Afghan women to demand rights and female representation in the caretaker government formed by the Taliban in the war-torn country. As the Taliban took control of Afghanistan once again after 20 years, experts believe that Afghan women are most likely to face an uncertain future under the terrorist group regime. The Taliban's seizure of the war-torn country came after international forces withdrew from Afghanistan, with the United States officially beginning its departure back in May and now it's on the verge of ending its military mission. Dr Sajjan Gohel, a security and terrorism analyst, had informed that women are scared out of their (Taliban) minds, according to Four Nine, a prominent women's magazine in the West. "From the Afghan women I've spoken to, it's incredibly traumatic. You're looking at an entire generation who only read about the Taliban in books. Now, they're having to live side-by-side with what is effectively a misogynistic cult" Dr Gohel added. He also said that he believes we are going to see a return "to some degree of what we saw in the 1990s".||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/south-asia/taliban-put-conditions-to-restrict-protest-in-afghanistan/articleshow/86053405.cms||---

Trying to play it safe, the investors are shifting their investments from pure equity funds to ones that invest in both equity and debt, fund industry executives said, citing official data. Long-term investors, however, remain firmly on track, resulting in record monthly inflows through the systematic investment plan (SIP) route. In August, the inflows through this route jumped to Rs 9,923 crore — an alltime high level — from Rs 9,608 crore in July. This is the second consecutive month of Rs 9,000-crore-plus net inflows through the SIP route, data from industry trade body AMFI showed. Overall industry data also showed an upward trend with total assets at the end of last month at Rs 36.6 lakh crore, compared to Rs 35.3 lakh crore at the end of July. During August, net inflow in equity funds was at Rs 8,667 crore, which was much below July’s Rs 22,583 crore figure. In comparison, hybrid funds continued to witness strong inflows with Rs 18,706 crore in August on the back of a Rs 19,481-crore inflow in July, AMFI data showed. In the hybrid category, boosted by the new fund offer (NFO) for SBI MF’s ‘Balanced Advantage Fund’, the net inflow jumped to Rs 16,571 crore. The fund management subsidiary of India’s largest bank SBI had garnered over Rs 14,500 crore in that fund, the highest NFO collection by a single scheme in India. After the close of the NFO, SBI MF officials had told TOI that since markets were at an elevated level, a large number of investors had shifted from pure equity schemes and invested in its hybrid scheme. White Oak Capital CEO Aashish Somaiyaa also indicated a similar investor behaviour. According to him, there is a significant shrinkagein the net flow for equity category and corresponding bump-up in net inflow of the balanced advantage category. “This leads one to believe that, on aggregate industry level, the large balanced advantage NFO has garnered a lot of traction by way of switches from equity to balanced advantage category. From retail investors’ perspective, in the short term, it may not be a bad development given elevated market levels and generally lower risk perception of balanced advantage funds,” Somaiyaa said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/mutual-fund-investors-turn-cautious-in-august-shift-to-hybrid-funds/articleshow/86053477.cms||---
---||Business||Cabinet defers call on telecom package||NEW DELHI: A package for the ailing telecom industry could not be cleared by the Union Cabinet on Wednesday, pending a legal opinion, sources said, adding that the matter is likely to be taken up soon, possibly in the next meeting. One of the sources said the matter had been tabled at the Cabinet meeting on Wednesday morning, following hectic parleys between various wings of the government to cobble up a revival package in view of the poor health of the sector, especially Vodafone Idea, which appears to be on the brink of a collapse. “It was decided that a legal opinion needs to be taken on a certain policy decision, and thus the matter was deferred,” the source said. Telecom secretary Anshu Prakash held a meeting with top officials in the ministry as the department works overtime in its efforts to nurse the industry back to health, while also enabling Vodafone Idea to recover. The telecom package had been hurried as Vodafone Idea threatens to go down on financial woes, a development that may result in a huge loss to the exchequer.

---||Bhubaneswar||Odisha takes top spot in curbing vaccine wastage||BHUBANESWAR: Odisha has topped in the country in terms of curbing vaccine wastage. The state has so far saved 12.2 lakh doses and thus registered -5.5 per cent misuse. This means the state administered 105 doses and saved five for every 100 doses allotted. The state till Wednesday administered 2.45 crore doses, which include 12.2 lakh saved doses. The capital’s entire population can be vaccinated with at least the first jab with the saved doses. Bijay Panigrahi, director, health and family welfare, said: “The 12.2 lakh doses include the total doses administered so far in the state, but we take them as additional doses since they have been saved.” “Ideally, one vial of vaccine is meant for 10 beneficiaries, but it can be stretched to 11, while 10 vials can be utilised for up to 110 doses. In Odisha, it is 105 as we can save doses in some vials. So the wastage is -5.5 per cent. Had our vaccination per 10 vials been somewhere around 98 or 99, it would have been a waste,” Panigrahi added. Neighbouring Chhattisgarh’s vaccine wastage percentage is -9. While Odisha till Tuesday achieved 58 per cent coverage of the first dose, seven districts have less than 50 per cent coverage. Districts with less than 60 per cent of second dose coverage against the due target are Malkangiri (50 per cent), Nabarangpur (55 per cent), Boudh (57 per cent) and Kandhamal (58 per cent). Nine districts are yet to cross the 1-lakh mark in terms of administering the second dose. On Wednesday, 2.16 lakh doses were administered at 1,360 vaccination centres, taking the total numbers of first dose to 1,84,86718 and the second to 60,67,292. The state on Wednesday reported 762 new infections against 754 recoveries, bringing the number of active cases down to 6,853, which is 1.78 per cent of the country’s cumulative active caseload so far. The death toll in Odisha stands at 8,070. Except Boudh, all 29 districts reported new Covid-19 cases, with Khurda and Cuttack each reporting three-digit figures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/state-takes-top-spot-in-curbing-vax-wastage/articleshow/86050556.cms||Riyan Ramanath V

This is a common observation of most teachers after the recent reopening of educational institutions in the state. As all the institutions had shifted to online classes following the nationwide lockdown in March last year, students were compelled to opt for digital mode of learning. Gradually they became more dependent on audio-visual techniques to learn their lessons. They mastered the art of tapping out their thoughts, messages and answers on a keyboard or a touch screen phone. Sujata Chandra, a teacher of Indian Public School, said when the school reopened recently after a long gap, most students were found avoiding writing in the class. “They just scribbled a word or two on their exercise books and shied away from taking long dictations. And, the writing of even those students who somehow managed to write, was not at all legible,” she said. The teacher said that such a habit will land students in trouble. Students must resume their writing habits at the earliest so that their writing skill remains intact. She admitted that online classes were of shorter duration and there was no way for teachers to check notebooks. St Michael’s High School teacher Rahul Kumar Prasad said most students were feeling uncomfortable in taking long dictations in classes when the school reopened recently after a long stint of online teaching. They were taking notes in very cryptic and erratic writing, not to be understood easily. Most of them admitted that they had not used their pens since they were working all the time on their tablets or phones. Manoranjan Prasad, a teacher of Nayagaon Primary School, observed that the pandemic has left an impact on children’s handwriting. Being able to write independently for extended period of time is a crucial skill for children which was not feasible for them in an online class, he said. Prof (retd) N K Chaudhary said, “ “When we were students, we used to copy texts from books in the library and, in the process, we internalized that knowledge. But, nowadays students get the entire texts photocopied.” “Even in classrooms, most students do not copy diagrams or tables from blackboards or PPTs, rather they take a snap of the same on their smartphones. Growing use of SMS, Whatsapp and e-mails have not only adversely affected the purity of the language but also alienated our youth from the world of writing,” Chaudhary added. A professor of psychology, Sheo Sagar Prasad, pointed out that in recent examinations of Patna University it was observed that most students were not able to write their answers in the allotted time as they complained of pain in their fingers and hand after writing a page or two. Moreover, in some cases, examinees were not able to recollect answers to even the topics they had been taught in online classes, he said. Prasad observed that handwriting is far superior to alternative modes for producing text. The physical connectivity of pen on page seems to have a beneficial effect by impacting differentially on the workings of the brain. “Handwriting could have cognitive benefits, artistic merit, a personal touch and it could help students learn faster,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/pandemic-takes-its-toll-on-kids-handwriting/articleshow/86045966.cms||B K Mishra

Dushyant Dave, senior counsel appearing for the state government, sought time to file replies to the interlocutory applications (IAs) moved by the petitioners. Arguing on behalf of the petitioners, senior counsel Basava Prabhu Patil told the high court that they have filed additional material papers and two interlocutory applications. Dave opposed Patil’s request, stating the petitioners are filing fresh applications 65 days after the first listing of the case. He said the petitioners are not interested in disposal of the matters but in causing obstacles and embarrassment to the state government by filing fresh IAs impleading banks and amending prayers. Considering the arguments on both sides, the high court bench headed by Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice Ninala Jayasurya allowed the request of Dave and granted four weeks to file replies to the fresh IAs. TDP legislator Velagapudi Ramakrishna had moved the high court, challenging certain sections in the APSDC Act, which pave the way for the government to deposit the tax amount into APSDC account directly instead of a consolidated fund. Another petition opposes the transfer of government properties to APSDC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/govt-seeks-time-to-file-replies-to-ias/articleshow/86047640.cms||Srikanth Aluri

Though Chirag said he had gone there to invite Tejashwi to attend his father Ram Vilas Paswan’s first death anniversary function at his Patna residence on September 12, their bonhomie triggered speculations about a new political alignment in the backdrop of a split in LJP recently with all the party MPs, except Chirag, supporting his uncle Pashupati Kumar Paras and accepting him as the party president. The Chirag-Tejashwi meeting is also being viewed in the backdrop of RJD founder Lalu Prasad suggesting that the two young leaders should join hands. However, Chirag said there should be no political meaning in the meeting. Citing cordial and family relations which his father had with his colleagues, especially Lalu, Chirag said he was carrying forward that legacy. “Had he been alive, he would have invited everyone to any family event. I will also meet Lalu Ji in Delhi tomorrow,” he said. Chirag further said he has also sought time to meet Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar. However, it is difficult for Bihar CM to spare time, especially when it involves him. Tejashwi also talked about the personal relation which his father and Ram Vilas shared and said Lalu may attend the ‘barsi’ if his health permits. He also talked about the campaigning techniques which he had learnt from Ram Vilas after stepping into politics. When asked about the desire expressed by Lalu that the two young leaders should come together, Tejashwi replied with smile, “When Lalu Ji has already expressed his desire, then what can I say.” Without naming Nitish, Tejashwi criticized him not giving time to Chirag on such a sensitive issue. Earlier, Chirag had gone to Raj Bhavan and invited governor Phagu Chauhan to the September 12 function. He has also invited Prime Minster Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah and Congress national president Sonia Gandhi to his father’s first death anniversary function. This event holds a political significance as it comes at a time when Chirag has been sidelined by his close relatives - uncle Paras and cousin Prince Raj, the Samastipur MP eho has been made the LJP (Paras) Bihar president. In fact, a day before, Chirag had shared a screenshot of the invitation card of his father’s death anniversary in which the names of both Paras and Prince were there as the hosts to the event.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/chirag-tejashwi-meeting-sets-tongues-wagging/articleshow/86046093.cms||Sheezan Nezami
---||Business||Actor gets ITAT relief over Rs 30 lakh gift from dad||MUMBAI: The Mumbai bench of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) has held that a gift of Rs 30 lakh received by Bollywood actor Kushal Tandon from his father is not bogus and cannot be treated as unexplained income. This was one of the disputed tax issues for the financial year 2013-14 for which the actor had filed an appeal with the ITAT. If the tribunal had upheld the gift as an unexplained income (technically known as an ‘unexplained cash credit’), the actor would have had to pay tax on it at a steep rate of 83.25%. Gifts received from certain relatives (such as parents) are exempt from income tax (I-T) under Section 56 of the I-T Act. However, tax officers tend to examine gifts through a microscopic lens to ensure that no foul play is involved and unaccounted money is not being shown as a gift. If the recipient is unable to substantiate the gift, it is treated as an ‘unexplained cash credit’, which is taxed at a high rate of 60% plus 25% surcharge and also a 6% penalty. The final tax rate is 83.25% approximately. In this case, Tandon was asked to provide documentary evidence to support the gift transaction. His father’s I-T return for the year in which the gift was made showed an income of Rs 4.12 lakh only. On this basis, the I-T officer held this gift to be an ‘unexplained cash credit’ and sought to tax it accordingly in the actor’s hands. Tandon submitted to the ITAT that the then limited earnings of the actor were not enough to help him meet his expenses. Thus, his father had come to the rescue of his only son and had gifted this amount out of his past savings. His father, Virendra Tandon, was a regular I-T payer and had disclosed the gift transaction in his financial statements. A gift deed had also been duly submitted to the tax authorities. However, the ITAT pointed out that the I-T department had failed to take into cognisance that the father had gifted the sum out of his past accumulated savings. In its order, the ITAT said, “We concur with the view taken by the I-T officer that the income shown in the tax return of Virendra Tandon was not substantial. However, a material fact that had been lost sight of by the lower tax authorities is that the actor’s father had never stated that he had gifted the amount in question out of his income for the year under consideration, but had in unequivocal terms stated that the same was given by him out of his past accumulated savings.” The I-T department failed to verify whether the accumulated savings were generated over the years from his income on which income tax had been paid or were from any secret accumulated funds. Instead, the I-T officer rushed through the assessment, added the ITAT order. Based on the entirety of the facts presented to it, the ITAT bench, comprising accountant member S Rifaur Rahman and judicial member Ravish Sood, said the addition of Rs 30 lakh as unexplained cash credit was devoid of any merit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/actor-gets-itat-relief-over-rs-30l-gift-from-dad/articleshow/86049415.cms||---
---||Vijayawada||PIL against painting solid waste plants with YSRC flag colours||Vijayawada: The Andhra Pradesh high court on Wednesday summoned the managing director (MD) of Swachh Andhra Corporation and principal secretary of panchayat raj in a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) petition, challenging the painting of solid waste and sewerage management plants with colours similar to those on the YSRC party flag. One Parasa Suresh Kumar from Vijayawada filed the petition before the high court alleging that painting government constructions with colours akin to those of a political party is illegal and in violation of Government Advertisement (Content Regulation) Guidelines, 2014. Arguing on behalf of the petitioner, advocate Jada Sravan Kumar told the high court bench headed by Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice Ninala Jayasurya that painting government structures with the colours of the ruling party is also in violation of the high court orders. He cited the court’s orders in the case of painting government offices with YSRC flag colours, in which the high court directed the state government remove the colours. Arguing on behalf of the state government, advocate general S Sriram said the colour scheme selected to paint waste management plants was given by the Union government. He said it was incidental that the colour scheme suggested by the Union government resembles that of the YSRC flag. Considering the arguments of the advocate general, the high court asked that the officials responsible come before the court and explain the Union government guidelines.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/pil-against-painting-solid-waste-plants-with-ysrc-flag-colours/articleshow/86047592.cms||Srikanth Aluri

Arguing on behalf of the petitioner, advocate Y Balaji said the government has issued a GO on Tuesday stating that the GOs will be uploaded on e-gazette website. However, the conditions in the GO to publish only select GOs on the website are highly objectionable and in violation of provisions of the Right to Information Act. Balaji further said that in the new GO, it was stated that secret, top secret and GOs that are not important will not be published on the website. He sought time to file a fresh application to challenge the new GO. The high court asked the government pleader why the GOs are not being published. As the special government pleader was not available at the time of hearing, the high court bench headed by Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice Ninala Jayasurya posted the matter for further hearing on Monday by allowing the request of the petitioners.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/petitioners-get-time-to-file-fresh-plea/articleshow/86047687.cms||Srikanth Aluri

Out of the six people on board the tractor, four people somehow escaped but a mother-daughter duo was washed away by the water current. On Wednesday morning, the emergency services team managed to find the body of the woman and also pulled out the submerged tractor. However, the girl was missing till the time of filing this report and the rescue operation was underway. Pramod Kumar, additional superintendent of police (ASP), Kashipur, said that Kosi river has swelled due to heavy rainfall and water levels have crossed the danger levels. “Tractors (in private capacity) are deployed at the Manki Ghat in the Sultanpur Patti of Bazpur town and they charge a minimal fee to help people cross the river as this is a shortcut to reach Bazpur. On Tuesday evening, Munni Devi (35), her husband Mangal Singh, and their seven-year-old daughter Simran boarded a tractor to cross the river. The tractor already had two passengers and three bikes on board. As soon as the tractor entered the river, the driver lost control over the vehicle as the water level was too high. As a consequence, the tractor got swept away in the water. Mangal Singh, the tractor driver, and the two others managed to swim to the bank of the river. However, Munni Devi and Simran got swept away,” ASP Kumar said. Subsequently, the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) was pressed into service but the rescue operation was soon stopped as it got dark in the night. The operation commenced again on Wednesday morning with 39 divers. “We are using backhoes to divert the water flow. The body of the mother was found beneath the tractor hood while the girl is still missing,” said CO Bazpur, Vandana Verma.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/tractor-washed-away-in-swollen-river-one-dead-one-missing/articleshow/86046527.cms||Aakash Ahuja
---||Business||After 4 yrs, UCO Bank out of corrective action||MUMBAI: The RBI on Wednesday removed UCO Bank from its prompt corrective action (PCA) framework following improvement in various parameters and a written commitment that the state-owned lender will comply with the minimum capital norms. On a review of the performance of the UCO Bank, the board for financial supervision on the basis of FY21 results found that the bank was not in breach of PCA parameters, the RBI said. The bank, it said, has also provided a written commitment that it would comply with the norms of minimum regulatory capital, net NPA (non-performing assets) and leverage ratio on an ongoing basis. The lender has also apprised the RBI of the structural and systemic improvements that it has put in place, which would help the bank in continuing to meet the financial commitments. “Taking all the above into consideration, it has been decided that UCO Bank is taken out of the PCA restrictions subject to certain conditions and continuous monitoring,” the RBI said. The Kolkata-headquartered lender has been under PCA since May 2017. PCA is triggered when banks breach certain regulatory requirements such as return on asset, minimum capital and quantum of NPAs. The restrictions disable banks in several ways to lend freely and force them to operate under a restrictive environment that turns out to be a hurdle to growth. UCO Bank had posted over a fourfold jump in its net profit to Rs 102 crore for the first quarter of the current fiscal, as bad loans fell significantly. The lender trimmed its gross non-performing assets (NPAs or bad loans) significantly to 9.37 per cent of the gross advances as of June 30, 2021, as against 14.38 per cent at June-end 2020. The net NPAs were down at 3.85 per cent (Rs 4,387.25 crore) from 4.95 per cent (Rs 5,138.18 crore). Shares of UCO Bank closed at Rs 12.81 apiece on BSE, almost flat over Tuesday. The RBI’s announcement came after market hours. Indian Overseas Bank (IOB) and Central Bank of India are still under the PCA framework.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/after-4-yrs-uco-bank-out-of-corrective-action/articleshow/86049227.cms||---

His last rites would be performed with state honours, Nitish said. Singh, 76, had been elected to Bihar legislative assembly nine times from Kahalgaon in Bhagalpur. He had also served as the Speaker of Bihar Vidhan Sabha and a cabinet minister. In Bihar Congress, Singh played an important role as the party’s state president as well as the legislative party leader.

CM Nitish Kumar on Wednesday asked all the district magistrates (DMs) and the agriculture department officials to consider ‘non-planting of crops due to flood’ as the ‘case of crop loss’ and provide adequate assistance to such farmers. He also asked the officials to make a proper assessment for all other cases of crop losses and ensure timely financial assistance to the affected farmers across the state. The CM was issuing instructions to the officials, especially the DMs, after he reviewed the district-wise flood and scanty rain situation ata marathon meeting that continued for more than five and a half hours.

The in-charge ministers would visit the districts and hold a meeting with the DMs concerned to give a final shape to the assessment. Nitish asked the animal and fisheries resources department to make a proper assessment regarding loss of livestock in flood-affected areas and take necessary steps to help animal keepers. The state’s water resources department (WRD) was asked to work on a long-term plan for permanent solution of recurring floods so that the impact could be minimized.

The incident happened around two-and-a-half months ago but came to light on Wednesday after the girl’s mother lodged a complaint with the police. According to assistant commissioner of Disha police V V Naidu, the accused is an outsourced employee at a prominent architecture college in Vijayawada.

The girl’s mother lodged a complaint with Nunna police despite her in-laws and husband attempting to hush up the matter. Cops said the accused has been booked and arrested under relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012 at Nunna police station while Disha police are investigating the case.

---||Patna||RCP Singh finds no place in NE Executive Council formed by JD(U) president||PATNA: The JD(U) on Tuesday reconstituted its North East Executive Council (NEEC) to strengthen the organization in all northeastern states, especially in Manipur where the party is girding up its loins to contest the assembly polls to be held in early next year. Party’s former national president and Union steel minister RCP Singh, who was in the previous NECC constituted by the then party chief Nitish Kumar, has not found a place in the new committee constituted by the party’s national president Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan Singh on Tuesday. Sources in the JD(U) said the NECC is the first committee reconstituted by Lalan Singh after he took over as the party’s national president on July 31 this year, replacing RCP. The NEEC was first constituted on June 1, 2018 by the then JD(U) president and Bihar CM Nitish Kumar and the then general secretary (organization) RCP was kept in the executive council as the president’s nominated member, along with K C Tyagi, the then national secretary general. Though Tyagi has been retained in the reconstituted committee as a member, RCP has been left out. JD(U)’s national secretary Sanjay Verma, who was a ‘special invitee’ member in the first NEEC constituted by Nitish, has also not found a berth in the new committee. Verma is still the JD(U)’s incharge for northeastern states like Assam, Meghalaya and Tripura. But he was not renominated in the new committee. “Verma might have been dropped from the NE committee because JD(U) had a very poor performance in the last assembly polls in Assam. Verma was incharge for the Assam polls,” a senior party leader told TOI on Tuesday. Contacted over phone, Verma declined to make any comment over his ouster from the NEEC. JD(U)’s Nagaland state president Senchumo NSN Lotha has been retained as convener of the NEEC. Another prominent leader who has been retained in the new committee is the JD(U) national general secretary and party’s incharge for northeast states Afaque Ahmad Khan. Under Khan’s leadership, the JD(U) had won seven assembly seats out of 15 it contested in Arunachal Pradesh in 2019. Then, the JD(U) had become the second largest party in Arunachal Pradesh. JD(U)’s national general secretary and Bihar minister Sanjay Kumar Jha, Jhanjharpur MP and party’s incharge for Manipur Ram Prit Mandal and Anil Hegde are new entrants in the committee. “JD(U)’s state presidents of Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, Tripura, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Sikkim would be members of the NEEC,” Khan, who issued notification regarding reconstitution of the NEEC, told TOI on Tuesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/rcp-finds-no-place-in-ne-executive-council-formed-by-jdu-president/articleshow/86019491.cms||Madan Kumar
---||Vijayawada||Andhra Pradesh: Groundwater in Krishna villages turns saltier||VIJAYAWADA: Seawater intrusion continues to remain a major issue for areas situated within a 30 km radius of the coastline in the Krishna district. In places such as Machilipatnam and Koduru, which are close to the coast, the hardness in water continues to spike and stands at 385.61 ppm and 735.49 ppm respectively. Other areas with the presence of high salinity levels and hardness include Avanigadda, Nagayalanka, Gudlavaleru and Pamarru. According to a recent study published in the International Journal of Engineering Research & Technology (IJERT), there has been a substantial increase in the salinity levels and hardness of the water in the groundwater samples collected from 23 villages. “The increased use of groundwater and inadequate rainfall has caused the saltwater interface to coastal regions like Krishna delta,” the IJERT study reads. Another study conducted by Animal Equality between 2019 and 2020 highlights that the conversion of Krishna and Godavari delta lands into water bodies for aquafarming had accelerated salinisation despite the abundant flood from the Krishna River. The report cites that an increase in aqua farming in Krishna and West Godavari in recent years has converted fertile lands into water bodies, resulting in increasing salination of the groundwater table. Government figures from the fisheries department indicate that there has been a three-fold increase in brackish water area from 2014 to 2017 from 20,000 to 56,094 hectares and if illegal cultivation is considered, this figure could increase up to one lakh hectares. Experts point out that one of the major concerns of increasing groundwater table is its impact on the mangrove forests at Krishna Estuary. The second-largest mangrove forest in India which supplies at least 25% of the oxygen for the entire district has already been reeling with stunted growth for the past decade. However, thanks to river water flow to the estuary, there has been a significant improvement in water quality in the region so far this monsoon season. Owing to adequate rainfall, there has been a slump in the salinity levels in the groundwater tables in some areas as Krishna river water released from Prakasam Barrage has reached these regions, replenishing groundwater with fresh water.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/groundwater-in-krishna-villages-turns-saltier/articleshow/86047333.cms||Ujwal Bommakanti

One person has also lost his life due to the viral flu. Public health officials in the city were much relieved when hardly any swine flu cases were reported last year. This had ensured that such patients did not occupy beds that were needed desperately for Covid-19 patients. While swine flu does not spread as widely and rapidly as Covid-19, sources said that the death rate due to the flu is higher as compared to Covid-19. In 2019, several deaths attributed to the flu had sparked a row. But the ‘official’ data now available shows that only nine person out of 441 who tested positive have died. VMC sources said that the data of deaths was confirmed by the state government after a death audit. Much like Covid-19, deaths of several swine flu patients that took place primarily due to other reasons were excluded from the official data. The number of cases this year, however, is not being considered alarming by the civic body. “It has become an endemic disease now and cases may keep surfacing,” said VMC’s medical officer (health) Dr Devesh Patel.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/in-vadodara-swine-flu-cases-start-trickling-in/articleshow/86046280.cms||---

He also asked RJD leaders and workers to put all efforts to do away with internal differences and win the upcoming bypolls for two assembly seats in the state. He was addressing a meeting of RJD’s district presidents and general secretaries at the 10, Circular Road bungalow allotted to his mother and party’s vice-president Rabri Devi. Sources said Tejashwi made it very clear no interference will be allowed in the functioning of Jagadanand. His statement is considered as a hint to his elder brother Tej Pratap, who has frequently attacked the party’s state president in recent past and even criticized him for the way he had been handling the RJD office. Tejashwi instructed the party’s office-bearers to start preparation for the byelection in Kusheshwar Asthan and Tarapur assembly constituencies and hold two press conferences at least every week in these areas. “We had lost by small margins. If you work hard, we will definitely win,” he said. The RJD leader said recognition in the party will be given as per the performance and he will be minutely watching all the party workers. “Be away from negative things and instead work hard to make your party strong. Let’s do away with internal disputes and work to bring the party to power. Instead of being in the party for namesake, involve yourself with full dedication,” Tejashwi told them. Jagadanand said a separate training camp will be organized for north and south Bihar districts. While two-day training for south Bihar districts will beheld from September 21 at 1, Polo Road bungalow, another one for north Bihar will be announced soon. District presidents and general secretaries, block presidents and mahanagar presidents will be imparted training in these camps.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/jagada-is-free-to-take-decisions-tejas/articleshow/86046064.cms||Sheezan Nezami

Police sources said that on Wednesday morning, a 17-year-old boy, studying in Class XII, hanged himself in his house in Kashipur’s Sainik Colony. Sub-inspector Surabhi Baudhayi said that a suicide note was recovered from the youth’s pocket in which he alleged that people would make fun of him as he was pursuing Class XII from an open school. “The body has been sent for postmortem while we are trying to identify the people who used to tease the victim,” SI Baudhayi said. In the other incident in Rudrapur, a 34-year-old man, identified as Vinendra Kumar, hanged himself in his rented accommodation in Sanjay Nagar Khera Colony of the city. The victim is a native of the Bareilly district in Uttar Pradesh. On Wednesday morning, the neighbours informed the police about the incident. “The kin of the victim had gone to Bareilly and he was home alone. After legal formalities, the body was handed over to his family members for last rites,” said a police officer. The officer added that the victim's wife Pinky has told the police that Vinendra called her a night ago and said that he had a tiff with someone and that he will kill himself.

---||Delhi||HC grants Centre time to reply to plea against Rakesh Asthana as Delhi top cop||NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court on Wednesday granted more time to the Centre to respond to a petition challenging the appointment of Rakesh Asthana as Delhi Police commissioner. A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh agreed to the request by solicitor general Tushar Mehta seeking some more time to file a response and listed the matter for September 16. The court had earlier this month issued notices to the Centre and the police chief on the petition. It is hearing a PIL by one Sadre Alam against the appointment of Asthana along with an intervention application by an NGO, which has challenged the appointment before the Supreme Court. During the brief hearing, advocate Prashant Bhushan, representing the NGO, Centre for Public Interest Litigation, reiterated that Alam’s petition was mala fide and a “complete copy-paste” of his plea pending before the apex court. He said the court should see whether this kind of mala fide petition should be entertained. The solicitor general said he agreed with Bhushan and this practice of copy-paste must be deprecated. He commented, however, that if Bhushan makes a plea public before filing it, nobody is to be blamed. To this, Bhushan replied that most of the information was in the public domain. The plea has sought quashing of the July 27 order issued by the ministry of home affairs appointing Asthana as the top cop and also the order granting inter-cadre deputation and extension of service to him. It also sought initiation of steps for appointing Delhi Police commissioner strictly in accordance with the direction issued by the Supreme Court earlier. The Centre had earlier contended before the high court that “intermeddlers” cannot be allowed to challenge the appointment of Asthana, saying “This is not Jantar Mantar or Ramlila Maidan.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hc-grants-centre-time-to-reply-to-plea-against-asthana-as-top-cop/articleshow/86051179.cms||---

The 24-year-old MBBS student of LLRM Medical College alleged that police have not taken any action against Vishal Chaudhary and Manish Sharma -- members of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) -- despite his complaint. Police, meanwhile, claimed that the accused and the victim have struck a compromise. The student -- son of a government doctor in Ghaziabad -- had filed a complaint with the Medical College police station on Monday evening, soon after the attack. The SHO of the police station told TOI that both the accused and the victim were students and a compromise has been struck between them. The victim, on his part, told TOI that he never struck a compromise and the accused didn’t even turn up at the police station. “All I want is action against the accused. Police are not filing the FIR as they are from BJP,” he added. “I got stitches on my head. They also threatened to kill me if I complained. The only mistake my friend made was that he accidently crashed his car into the accused’s vehicle. We apologised too. But they started beating us. While my friend ran to call for help, I got caught and was beaten,” the victim told TOI. “Who knows they will beat someone else tomorrow. They must get punished. They must know that they cannot thrash people on the road just because they have political backing,” he added. Vimal Kumar, district president of BJP, confirmed to TOI that Manish Sharma is in BJP while he denied knowing Vishal Chaudhary. “We will see if our men have done anything wrong with anyone,” Kumar said. When contacted, SP City Vineet Bhatnagar said that he will inquire about the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/mbbs-student-thrashed-by-bjym-members-after-car-crash/articleshow/86044366.cms||Ishita Mishra

The HC bench, headed by Chief Justice Arup Kumar Goswami and Justice Ninala Jayasurya, posted the matter for hearing to next Wednesday. Raju argued in his petition that Sajjala should be considered as a public servant as he is drawing salary from the government. He has violated service rules on numerous occasions which is liable for disciplinary action, he alleged in the PIL, adding that AP civil service conduct rules are applicable to every person who is a member of the civil service or holds a civil post under the state or in connection with the affairs of the state. Advisors to the government should be considered as temporary civil servants as they are drawing salary from the state and in the absence of any service rules, they should be governed by the civil service conduct rules, Raju argued, further stating that while being a civil servant, Sajjala also holds a position in the YSRC as in-charge of three districts. By propagating the political views of YSRC from government forums, Sajjala has violated service rules and is liable for disciplinary action as per law, Raju said in the PIL. He also prayed for interim direction to direct Sajjala from addressing press conferences and making statements on behalf of the state government pending disposal of the petition.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/rebel-ysrc-mp-files-pil-against-sajjala/articleshow/86047559.cms||Srikanth Aluri

CPPIB has mandated BNP Paribas to execute the transaction through block deals on Thursday. The Canadian pension fund has set a price band of Rs 1,159-1,220 per share for the deal, market sources said. At the lower end of the band, the shares would be offered at a 5% discount to SBI Life’s closing price of Rs 1,220 on the BSE on Wednesday. The base offer size is for 2 crore shares of SBI Life. It has an option to increase the size of the offering by another 30 lakh shares, taking the total to 2.3 crore shares. According to shareholding data on the BSE, as of end-June, CPPIB was holding nearly 2.9 crore shares of SBI Life, representing 2.9% of the private life insurer’s equity base. The deal is set to be executed through the accelerated book-building process. Under this process, the broker managing the deal, after the close of the day’s trading, sends out the term sheet to large institutions to express their interest to buy shares from the block on offer. Once these institutions tell the broker managing the offer, the book for the deal is prepared.

---||Patna||‘Passengers pay extra in name of special trains’||PATNA: The Bihar Daily Passengers’ Association (BDPA) has submitted a representation to railway minister, Railway Board and ECR headquarters recently with a request to restore regular trains as the passengers have to pay extra Rs300 to 400 in AC class and Rs130 to 150 in sleeper class for travelling in special passenger trains. Railways has been running special trains on certain routes since June 2020 in the name of clearing passengers’ rush. Association’s secretary Shoaib Quraishi said, “It is unfortunate that passengers have to carry their own bedsheets, meals and blankets during journey despite paying extra to railways.” A passenger travelling by Magadh Express special (02871/02872) is paying Rs3,645 in AC1, Rs 2330 in AC11, Rs 1715 in AC3 and Rs 650 in sleeper class while normal fare is Rs3,225, Rs1910, Rs1350 and Rs510, respectively, for travelling from Patna to Delhi, sources said. In Patna-Jammu Tawi special (02355/02356), a passenger has to pay extra Rs300 to Rs150 as railways is charging Rs2885 in AC11, Rs2085 in AC3 and Rs830 in sleeper class. Similarly, the Patna-Ajmer Ziyarat Express special (02395/02396) fare is also marginally high as a passenger is charged Rs4040 for AC1, Rs2675 for AC11, Rs1945 in AC3 and Rs765 for sleeper class journey. The same is true about Patliputra-Chandigarh special (22355/22356), Patliputra-Yashwantpur (Bengaluru) special (03251/03252), Rajendra Nagar-Howrah special (02351/02352), Patna-Bhubaneswar special (08450/08451), Patna-Durg special (03287/03288) and many other special trains, said the association’s president, Birendra Sharma. The association also said special trains do not have ‘tatkal’ ticket facility and no concession is being given to senior citizen passengers in special trains. Railway employees pointed out that railways has allowed them to book one berth in AC2 and two in AC3 only on free railway privilege pass issued to them in special trains, they added. When contacted, an ECR official said railways will continue running special trains unless the ministry of home (MHA) or Railway Board gives permission to restore regular passenger trains.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/passengers-pay-extra-in-name-of-special-trains/articleshow/86046141.cms||Kumod Verma

Trying to play it safe, the investors are shifting their investments from pure equity funds to ones that invest in both equity and debt, fund industry executives said, citing official data. Long-term investors, however, remain firmly on track, resulting in record monthly inflows through the systematic investment plan (SIP) route. In August, the inflows through this route jumped to Rs 9,923 crore — an all-time high level — from Rs 9,608 crore in July. This is the second consecutive month of Rs 9,000-crore-plus net inflows through the SIP route, data from industry trade body AMFI showed. Overall industry data also showed an upward trend with total assets at the end of last month at Rs 36.6 lakh crore, compared to Rs 35.3 lakh crore at the end of July. During August, net inflow in equity funds was at Rs 8,667 crore, which was much below July’s Rs 22,583 crore figure. In comparison, hybrid funds continued to witness strong inflows with Rs 18,706 crore in August on the back of a Rs 19,481-crore inflow in July, AMFI data showed. In the hybrid category, boosted by the new fund offer (NFO) for SBI MF’s ‘Balanced Advantage Fund’, the net inflow jumped to Rs 16,571 crore. The fund management subsidiary of India’s largest bank SBI had garnered over Rs 14,500 crore in that fund, the highest NFO collection by a single scheme in India. After the close of the NFO, SBI MF officials had told TOI that since markets were at an elevated level, a large number of investors had shifted from pure equity schemes and invested in its hybrid scheme. White Oak Capital CEO Aashish Somaiyaa also indicated a similar investor behaviour. According to him, there is a significant shrinkage in the net flow for equity category and corresponding bump-up in net inflow of the balanced advantage category. “This leads one to believe that, on aggregate industry level, the large balanced advantage NFO has garnered a lot of traction by way of switches from equity to balanced advantage category. From retail investors’ perspective, in the short term, it may not be a bad development given elevated market levels and generally lower risk perception of balanced advantage funds,” Somaiyaa said. AMFI data for last month showed that all of large-cap, mid-cap and small-cap schemes recorded either net outflows or marginal inflows, while flexicap and focused equity schemes recorded strong inflows. Tax-saving equity schemes (popularly known as ELSS) too continued to see net outflows. According to Sharekhan head (investment solutions) Gautam Kalia, lower equity inflows in August compared to July could be an indication of investors booking profits in equity schemes. “The rally in the markets has attracted many conservative investors to also enter the market, which is the reason for the consistent growth in the hybrid funds category since the beginning of the year. Dynamic asset allocation funds witnessed the maximum inflow this month with almost six times increase in the inflow as compared to that of the previous month,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/mf-investors-turn-cautious-in-aug-shift-to-hybrid-funds/articleshow/86049169.cms||---

A large number of infections may occur during this third wave,” said a bench of Acting Chief Justice M S Ramachandra Rao and Justice T Vinod Kumar while resuming hearing in Covid-19 batch of PILs. With the state failing to follow HC’s earlier directive to submit the minutes of this committee’s meeting on tackling any third wave, on Wednesday, the court gave the government one week to submit the expert panel’s report. The bench also directed the state public health director to file an affidavit on the status of medical infrastructure meant to serve children. The high court bench was also unhappy when assistant solicitor general Namavarapu Rajeswara Rao said that they could not succeed in ensuring the inclusion of life-saving drugs used in Covid-19 treatment in the list of essential drugs. “The relevant nodal authority for the central government has to either get this done within the next one week or file an affidavit. If it fails to do so, then it has to appear before this court virtually in the next hearing,” the bench said. Refuting the contention of the Centre’s counsel that this involved a long procedure, the bench said, “The virus knows no procedure. Better act according to the need of the hour.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-to-t-why-has-expert-panel-on-third-wave-not-met-once/articleshow/86051160.cms||---

So far, nearly 1.2 crore returns for the last financial year have been filed, with over 76.2 lakh tax payers using the new portal’s online utility for the purpose, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) said. Describing it as an encouraging trend, CBDT said nearly 95 lakh income tax returns have been e-verified, with over seven lakh having been processed. E-verification of returns is a pre-condition for processing of returns. The statement marks a change in the department’s tone towards Infosys, which had blamed India’s premier IT company for the glitches on the platform. It comes days after RSS mouthpiece Panchjanya attacked Infosys for funding “anti-India forces” and messing with the portal. RSS, however, distanced itself from the report. Amid complaints from the vocal tax professionals, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman resorted to “summoning” Infosys CEO Salil Parekh twice and has now set a deadline of September 15 for making the portal glitch-free. Even now, several taxpayers are complaining about their inability to log in or file their returns. “The ministry of finance has been regularly monitoring the resolution of issues with Infosys, which is the Managed Services Provider for the project… It is reiterated that the (income tax) department is continuously engaged with Infosys to ensure a smooth filing experience to taxpayers,” CBDT said. It added that return filing has increased to 3.2 lakh daily in September. In addition, taxpayers have been able to view over 8.7 lakh notices issued by the department under the faceless assessment, appeal or penalty proceedings and over 2.6lakh responses have been filed so far.  “An average of 8,285 notices for e-proceedings are being issued and 5,889 responses are being filed in September 2021 on a daily basis,” the tax department said. The numbers are also meant to signal to taxpayers that things are improving and they should go ahead with filing their returns as the deadline is fast approaching.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/tax-filings-reflect-portal-bug-getting-fixed-government/articleshow/86053507.cms||---

SAD had already declared candidature of former BJP minister Anil Joshi and Raj Kumar Gupta from Amritsar North and Sujanpur seats, respectively, after inducting him in the party. It was already clear that BSP would get two other seats. Trouble has, however, now started brewing for the alliance at Sham Chausrai. Former three-time SAD MLA Mohinder Kaur Josh and her supporters have opposed the decision of seat swapping. She has said she would contest elections on her own and she had already called an “adhikar rally” on September 13. “Akali Dal is much stronger here as compared to BSP. Giving this seat to BSP is injustice to me as well as to the local Akali workers,” she said while speaking to TOI on Wednesday evening. Josh, who is vice president of the party and core committee member of the Istri Akali Dal, said new entrants from BJP had been rewarded with tickets while a three-time MLA like her had been denied the ticket. “They could have given Sham Chaurasi to BSP when the alliance was decided. I and other workers have been continuously working here. Moreover, Akali Dal is much stronger here as compared to BSP,” she said. In a joint statement issued on Wednesday evening, several office-bearers of Akali Dal from Sham Churasi anounced to resign en-masse against the decision. Joshi had turned rebel in 2002 also, when SAD left this seat for Bahujan Samaj Morcha and she lost to Congress candidate by around 500 votes, while SAD-BSM candidate could get just around 7,000 votes. Sham Chaurasi was one of the seats which was being counted by BSP dissenters among strong seats of the party which should have been given to the BSP in the seat sharing. The decision of seat swapping now has strengthened their argument even as BSP supremo Mayawati had earlier ruled out any changes in the seat sharing. In Kapurthala, Akali Dal did not have any strong candidate and there were many claimants. BSP does not have very strong presence at the seat. BSP has announced Mohinder Singh Sandhran as it’s candidate from Sham Chaurasi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/sad-bsp-make-changes-in-seat-sharing-for-2022-pollssad-bsp-swap-seats-ex-mla-rebels/articleshow/86051212.cms||IP Singh

He was admitted to Thane Mental Hospital while in jail where he spent two years for treatment. In 2018 he was found fit to stand trial. While his 80-year-old father, who survived the attack, narrated how the accused had assaulted his wife and him with a sickle, he admitted he was mentally ill for long and under treatment. “He admits that on the day of incident, the accused was mentally unstable and the incident took place due to the mental instability of the accused. Relying on medical evidence, the court said he was mentally ill at the time and so could not be held guilty.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/man-who-killed-mother-set-free-as-he-was-mentally-ill-in-mumbai/articleshow/86052356.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Elephant carcass found in Terai Central forest division||Rudrapur: The carcass of an adult elephant was found in a partially decomposed state from the Dhimri range of the Terai Central forest division in the city’s Tanda jungle on Wednesday. The female elephant, aged around 30 years, is suspected to have succumbed to injuries it suffered during a train accident around three weeks ago in the same area. Notably, a male elephant and a calf were killed on the spot after being hit by the speeding Agra Fort Express train around half a kilometer from SIDCUL Halt railway station in Tanda forest range on August 18 and the track where the pachyderm died was captured by other elephants of the herd. The forest officials said that the jumbo found dead on Wednesday may also have suffered injuries during the same accident. This elephant may have gone inside the jungle and later succumbed to injuries, they add. Sub-divisional officer (SDO) of the forest department, Dhruv Singh Martoliya, said that prima facie evidence suggests that the pachyderm died of injuries. “A panel of veterinarians has been called at the spot. They are conducting the postmortem examination to ascertain the exact cause behind the jumbo's death,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/elephant-carcass-found-in-terai-central-forest-division/articleshow/86046541.cms||Aakash Ahuja

---||Kolkata||Kolkata: Rush for ready-made Ganesh idols in Kumartuli this year||KOLKATA: There has been a surge in sale of Ganesh idols in Kumartuli two days before Ganesh Chaturthi with many first-time organizers opting to buy a ready-made idol instead of pre-ordering the sculptors to make one for them as many housing committees took the decision to organise the puja a little late. Idol-makers in Kumartuli said there was a surge of buyers on Wednesday looking for small to mid-size ready-made idols of Ganesh. In other years, most organizers place their order for idol in advance, giving specification to the makers. Also, with the threat of another Covid wave looming large, many were indecisive about organizing the puja this year. These organizers, mostly in housing complexes and block committees, decided late about organising the puja, so they had to settle with ready-made idol Residents of Executive Palace in Baguiati are organizing Ganesh Puja for the first time. “Since March 2020, we have been mostly restricted to our homes, stepping out only for work. Participation in festivals or other occasions has reduced to a large extent. So, this year we have decided to organize a Ganesh Puja in our complex so that nobody has to step out to visit community pujas. Since we finalized our plan a little late, we could not order an idol. We have purchased a ready-made idol this year. If normalcy resumes next year, we will plan much in advance,’ said Ankit Agarwal, secretary of the residents’ association. According to idol-makers in and police sources, there might be close to 1,200 Ganesh Pujas in the city and its suburbs this year. “I had made 25 Ganesh idols, all of which have been sold,” said Haru Paul, an idol-maker in Kumartuli. Several households and business owners are also organizing Ganesh Puja this year for the first time. “We need the blessings of the god of prosperity and wealth more than ever at this time when financial fortunes have taken a bad hit. So, we have decided to organize a small Ganesh Puja at my shop on Kalakar Street,” said Kishor Oswal, a gift shop owner.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/rush-for-ready-made-ganesh-idols-this-year/articleshow/86048622.cms||Zeeshan Javed
---||Delhi||DMRC moves SC over stalling of Phase-IV work, seeks nod for tree cutting||NEW DELHI: Delhi Metro Rail Corporation on Wednesday moved the SC seeking permission for cutting and re-plantation of trees along the Phase-IV route connecting Krishna Park to Ashok Vihar and said the forest department's decision not to grant such permission has delayed the work by over a year and caused a loss of nearly 5 crore daily to DMRC. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta sought urgent hearing on DMRC's application by the SC’s green bench while mentioning it before a bench headed by Chief Justice N V Ramana, who said he would list it within a few days. He said the delay of more than a year beyond the stipulated time of construction of the Phase-IV metro rail network is also causing a revenue loss of nearly Rs 1.63 crore daily to the DMRC, in addition to seriously inconveniencing the public. “The matter is of urgency as the same relates to the construction work of Phase-IV of DMRC from Krishna Park to Ashok Vihar, wherein work has already been awarded to the civil contractors and all manpower and resources have been mobilised on the ground. Non conveyance of tree transplantation/cutting permission and stoppage of construction activity in a stretch by the forest department is resulting in underutilization of 3,000 labourers and staff engaged by the agencies and idling of heavy machinery causing loss to DMRC of approximately Rs 3.4 crore per day,” the DMRC application said. “Further it will lead to delay in commissioning of Phase-IV DMRC works abnormally, as it has already pushed back the commissioning by almost one year beyond the stipulated date. Such delay would result in revenue loss to DMRC of approximately Rs 1.63 crore per day and deprive the public at large of the benefit of green transportation,” it said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dmrc-moves-sc-over-stalling-of-phase-iv-work-seeks-nod-for-tree-cutting/articleshow/86051281.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Sachin Waze returned to the scene to look for ID card||MUMBAI: The disgraced assistant police inspector Sachin Waze, who was arrested for planting an explosive-laden vehicle near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence, had returned to the crime scene the same night to look for an identity card he misplaced. According to NIA’s chargesheet, a constable who was with Waze, revealed that the duo drove two separate cars – an Innova and a Scorpio – from Waze’s Thane residence. After crossing the Thane toll naka, they exchanged vehicles. When they reached Carmichael Road, Waze was driving the Scorpio. CCTV footage shows the time was 2.10 am on February 25. “Waze sat in the Scorpio for around 5 minutes and thereafter he came out from the left side of the Scorpio,” said the constable.  On their way back in the Innova, when they reached Byculla, Waze told his colleague he could not find his police identity card, says the chargesheet. The constable’s statement, however, solved the mystery behind the footage showing a person in a long kurta with a mask at the spot at 4.30 am peering inside the SUV. The duo had returned to the spot to look for Waze’s card.  Later outside Waze’s residence, the colleague waited while Waze looked for the card at home. He could not find it. When the constable asked him the reason for the trip to Carmichael Road, he was told it was a secret CIU operation.  The chargesheet does not clarify if Waze eventually found the card. The next day, the constable was shocked as news broke of the car outside Antilia.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-he-returned-to-the-scene-to-look-for-id-card/articleshow/86051223.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: No access to digital classes for govt school students||HYDERABAD: While the state has asked school managements not to compel students to attend offline classes and allow them to study from home, the provision seems to be missing for government school students as the school education department is yet to release a schedule for digital classes. The digital lessons being telecast through Doordarshan Yadagiri and TSAT were discontinued on September 1—the day physical classes started. Although recorded content is available on the TSAT App, not many have access to smartphones and internet facilities making it difficult for them to study from home. “I used to follow lessons through the DD channel, but for one week now I am unable to attend digital classes,” said Pavan M, a class10 student studying in a government school. He said that he can access TSAT only during the night while his parents are at home, but added that he is not sure which lessons to begin with. Students and their parents said that it would be better if the state continues digital lessons as well so that children can continue their education. “If the state is going to conduct exams, they should also think about those students who are unable to attend physical classes. They can’t expect all students to attend school,” said Govardhan K, whose daughter is in class 9. While physical classes were resumed on September 1, as on Wednesday, the attendance in offline classes stood at 35.83%. In government schools, the attendance percentage is said to be slightly better than in private schools. Officials of the school education department said that their intention is to get students back to school and want children to utilise this opportunity. “Even before the pandemic, the content was available on TSAT. There won’t be any separate schedule for digital classes now as physical classes resumed,” the official said. The digital classes being telecast through Doordarshan Yadagiri and TSAT were discontinued on Sept 1. But students and parents said it would be better if the state continues digital lessons as well so that children can continue their studies.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-access-to-digital-classes-for-govt-school-students/articleshow/86051247.cms||Nirupa Vatyam
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Param Bir Singh asked cyber expert to ‘alter’ Telegram report||MUMBAI: A cyber expert has told the National Investigation Agency (NIA) that former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh paid him Rs 5 lakh to make a report based on his instructions regarding the threat on a social media platform against industrialist Mukesh Ambani and his family.  The expert’s statement in the chargesheet had Congress and NCP expressing surprise on Wednesday over “the failure” to probe Singh’s role in the case. NCP minister Nawab Malik said NIA appeared to be protecting him despite Singh paying “a bribe of Rs 5 lakh” to fabricate evidence. Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said Singh was being shielded to create “false evidence against Anil Deshmukh”. The expert had said his report on Telegram posts by terror outfit Jaish-ul-Hind was not specific to the Ambani case and was altered at Singh’s directions to refer to it. The cop got an assistant to pay the expert Rs 5lakh cash for the job.  The expert had visited Singh’s office on March 9, 2021 to discuss training. He told Singh that the Telegram channel "Jaish-ul-Hind" on which a post on February 27 claimed responsibility for the Antilia terror scare, had been resolved by Delhi Police and the mobile linked to it was found to be used from within Tihar Jail. He told Singh he too had tracked a Telegram channel by a similar name since the blast outside the Israel embassy and shared data with Delhi Police. Singh then “asked whether I could give such a report in writing. I said the work was confidential ...done by Special Cell Delhi Police and it would not be proper…But CP Sir said it is a very important matter.” Due to his “insistence”, the expert prepared a single para report on a laptop sitting in Singh’s office. After reading it, “Singh sir asked me to insert the poster that had appeared on Telegram channel "Jaish-ul-Hind'' claiming responsibility for the Antilia scare. He told me…he would like to show the report to the IG NIA. Accordingly, I modified my report and inserted the poster…and mailed the said report to the official email id of CP Mumbai." Singh got his personal assistant to pay him Rs 5 lakh in cash for the report. “...told CP Sir that the amount was too much…but CP Sir insisted,” reads the statement. The expert told NIA that the Telegram channel “resolved by me had only 3/4 members and there was no poster related to Antilia terror scare.” Officials said they recorded his statement in August and may summon Singh next. NIA questioned Singh on April 7. It has said its probe into Telegram messages is on and they are pursuing an application called Text Now for details via the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty as its server is outside India. However, NCP said NIA’s actions were dubious. “Prima facie, it appears that Singh was assured he would be protected at any cost. As a result, so far, neither is his name in the charge-sheet nor a criminal case has been registered against him for bribing a cyber-expert,’’ Malik said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-singh-asked-cyber-expert-to-alter-telegram-report/articleshow/86051266.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Lucknow||Reprieve from Covid: Just 214 active cases in Uttar Pradesh now||LUCKNOW: The number of active cases in Uttar Pradesh continued to decline with sustained fall in the number of new cases and surge in recoveries. As per reports, just 214 active cases are left in the state, which is lower than the count recorded at the onset of the first wave. As per the Covid-19 bulletin released on Wednesday, nearly 37% of the total active cases were in just four districts, namely Prayagraj (24), Gautam Budh Nagar (20), Lucknow (18) and Jalaun (17). Besides, 31 districts of the state are now totally free from coronavirus infection, with not a single active case in Aligarh, Amroha, Ayodhya, Baghpat, Ballia, Balrampur, Banda, Basti, Bahraich, Bhadohi, Bijnor, Chandauli, Chitrakoot, Deoria, Etah, Fatehpur, Ghazipur, Gonda, Hamirpur, Hapur, Hardoi, Hathras, Kaushambi, Lalitpur, Mahoba, Muzaffarnagar, Pilibhit, Rampur, Shamli, Siddharthnagar and Sonbhadra. The count of active cases in the state dipped as only 16 new cases were detected, while 28 patients recovered in the past 24 hours. The total number of cases in Uttar Pradesh since the outbreak in 2020 reached 17.09 lakh and the recoveries rose to 16.86 lakh. No death was reported in the last 24 hours, and the coronacvirus toll in the state remained static at 22,863. In an official statement issued on Wednesday, the state government said that in sharp contrast to the situation in Uttar Pradesh, less populated states like Kerala, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu account for heavy active caseloads of 2,37,079, 47,926 and 16,205 respectively. UP is perhaps the only state in the country which is conducting nearly two lakh Covid-19 tests every day despite huge decline in cases and low caseload as compared to others, it added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/reprieve-from-covid-just-214-active-cases-in-up-now/articleshow/86052342.cms||---
---||Lucknow||OBC outreach: Dharmendra Pradhan named BJP in-charge of Uttar Pradesh elections||LUCKNOW/NEW DELHI: BJP on Wednesday named education minister Dharmendra Pradhan as poll in-charge of Uttar Pradesh in a signal to non-Yadav OBCs in the state. A prominent OBC leader, Pradhan has held poll responsibilities in Bihar previously and is familiar with the caste and factional equations in UP. Information and broadcasting minister Anurag Thakur was named as co-incharge. Pradhan’s appointment trains the spotlight on BJP’s attempts to consolidate OBC votes, which account for over 42% of the total voting population in the state. The decision is also seen as a counter to SP and BSP, which have tried to woo Brahmins, a community that has backed BJP, but can prove demanding when it comes to representation. In July, BJP had inducted three OBC leaders — B L Verma (Lodh), Pankaj Chaudhary (Kurmi) and Anupriya Patel (Kurmi) — in the Narendra Modi Cabinet. Introducing 27% reservation for OBCs and 10% for EWS category under All India Quota (AIQ) in medical entrance tests and the constitutional amendment restoring to states the right to draw their backward caste lists highlight the party’s focus on the community. Pradhan, who is from Angul district in Odisha, represents Madhya Pradesh in Rajya Sabha. He was earlier Union petroleum minister and is credited with successfully implementing the Centre’s flagship Ujjwala scheme -- envisaging free gas connection to poor rural households -- which helped BJP in the 2017 UP assembly elections and 2019 Lok Sabha polls. During the recent debate over passage of the constitutional amendment bill on state OBC lists, Pradhan had asserted that he was an OBC and understood the need for proper access to resources for the depressed sections. Pradhan’s co-charges include three ministers of state -- Arjun Ram Meghwal (parliamentary affairs), Shobha Karandlaje (agriculture and farmer welfare) and Annapurna Devi (education). The party has tried to strike a caste balance with Thakur from the Kshatriya community, while Meghwal is a Dalit and has been representing Bikaner. Saroj Pandey, on the other hand, is a Brahmin from Chhattisgarh and is a Rajya Sabha member. She had represented Durg constituency in 2014 Lok Sabha elections. Union ministers Pralhad Joshi, Gajendra Singh Shekhawat and Bhupender Yadav have been appointed incharge for Uttarakhand, Punjab and Manipur, respectively. Former Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has been given the charge of Goa polls, always seen to be a close and tricky affair. However, the focus on the all-important Uttar Pradesh polls was apparent in the announcement made by BJP as it also appointed organisational in-charges for its six regions. MP Sanjay Bhatia, Bihar MLA Sanjiv Chaurasia, BJP national secretaries Y Satya Kumar and Arvind Menon, UP leader Sunil Ojha and the party’s co-treasurer Sudhir Gupta will head western Uttar Pradesh, Braj, Awadh, Gorakhpur, Kashi and Kanpur regions, respectively. West Bengal MP Locket Chatterjee and party spokesperson R P Singh are co-incharges for the Uttarakhand polls. Fadnavis will be assisted by Union ministers G Kishan Reddy and Darshana Jardosh. Union minister Pratima Bhoumik and Assam minister Ashok Singhal will be co-incharges for Manipur polls, the party statement said. Union ministers Hardeep Singh Puri and Meenakshi Lekhi have been named co-incharges for the Punjab polls along with MP Vinod Chavda. Except Punjab, BJP is in power in other four pollbound states —Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur. UP BJP high-level meet to discuss strategy for assembly polls today:Even as the BJP constituted a team headed by union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan for the upcoming state polls, the state unit of the party has decided to call a high level meeting of functionaries on Thursday. BJP sources said that the meeting, scheduled to be presided over by state party president Swatantra Dev Singh, will have all vice-presidents and state general secretaries. Party national vice-president and UP in charge Radha Mohan Singh too is likely to join the meeting which is expected to finalise party programmes and campaigns in the run up to UP assembly elections due in the next few months. The meeting comes close on the heels of the party organisation stepping up constitution of all frontal wings (morchas) and convening their working committees to spruce up the party cadre to take on an aggressive opposition. Sources said that the state leadership was in no mood to recline and allow the opposition to firm up against the ruling party. Sources said that the state organisation will now be tasked to work in close coordination with the newly appointed team for UP election while scaling up its outreach to take the initiatives of the BJP government at the Centre and the state to the people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/another-obc-push-bjp-sends-pradhan-to-up-as-poll-in-charge/articleshow/86052325.cms||Pankaj Shah

The youth, Manoj Kumar, had allegedly spurned the marriage proposal of the girl. And when the girl threatened to commit suicide, Kumar allegedly told her to “do whatever you want”. According to police, the girl was exerting pressure on Kumar to marry for quite some time. Amroha’s superintendent of police Poonam said, “We have arrested the accused Manoj Kumar, a resident of Dariyapur village under Gajraula police station area. Kumar told police that he had good relations with the girl. However, she used to exert pressure for marriage. She proposed to him on September 4 also, the day she killed herself.” The SP said that a post-mortem report of the deceased confirmed the cause of death as hanging. The Class XI student, daughter of a village pradhan, went missing on Friday while on her way for tuition. Her bicycle was found parked near the spot she killed herself.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/meerut/girl-16-commits-suicide-after-youth-rejects-her-marriage-offer/articleshow/86041268.cms||Harveer Dabas
---||Kochi||Kochi: Row over Water Metro jetty work in conservation zone||KOCHI: Kochi Metro Rail Ltd (KMRL) is going ahead with the construction of a Water Metro terminal in the conservation zone in Fort Kochi despite the Art and Heritage Commission asking the Metro agency to stop the work in the area where construction is banned. The Metro authorities also pulled down centuries-old Karippura, the facility which had supplied coal to the ships coming from distant places, and even the first office building of Cochin Port. Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (Intach), a NGO which stands for the protection of heritage, had lodged a complaint with the Art and Heritage Commission against the Metro agency pulling down some of the heritage buildings and going ahead with the construction of the Water Metro jetty in the conservation zone. Basis on the complaint, the commission issued an order banning the construction at the site on March 30, 201. “But KMRL is still going ahead with the work on the jetty. So, we have moved the high court praying that the location of the Water Metro terminal should be shifted to another area. The case is pending for hearing,” said Intach, Cochin Chapter, convener Babu Rajeevan. “There are three jetties in the Fort Kochi area. The Metro authorities are not ready to relocate the proposed Water Metro terminal to one of the existing jetties,” said Cochin Port Trust former director Babu Rajeevan. At the same time, officials with the KMRL said that they had pulled down the centuries-old buildings before the Art and Heritage Commission issued the order against demolishing such structures. “We had demolished the structures on December 6, 2020 while the order of the commission came on March 30, 2021,” an official with KMRL said. On why the Water Metro terminal is not being relocated, the official said that it is up to the government to take a call on the issue. “We are just the implementing agency. It is up to the government to take a decision on such matters,” the official said. According to former mayor K J Sohan, there is a jetty which is operational in the nearby area. “The existing jetty is close to the Ro-Ro jetty. Moreover, the bus station is also close by. We don’t know why the authorities are taking a stubborn attitude that the Water Metro terminal should be constructed in the conservation area itself while more convenient locations are available in Fort Kochi,” Sohan said. “The Metro authorities pulled down a 200- year-old Karippura. Vessels from far-flung areas navigating via Suez would fill coal from Kochi when coal was the main fuel for the ships. Many ships had called on Kochi during the first and second world wars for filling the coal. It has such a heritage. But the authorities demolished it. The first office of Cochin Port and gear house where the equipment for anchoring vessels had been kept were also demolished,” Sohan said. “Moreover, two Chinese nets, which are considered to be the symbol of Kochi, will also be destroyed once the Water Metro terminal comes up in the proposed location,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/row-over-water-metro-jetty-work-in-conservation-zone/articleshow/86048653.cms||M K Sunil Kumar

The incident happened around 12.50pm when CISF officials noticed a man walking uncomfortably as he crossed the door frame metal detector (DFMD). The man — Ali Mohammed — was about to board a Delhi-bound flight scheduled to leave Kolkata in an hour. “The DFMD sensed nothing and neither did the hand-held metal detectors. Our screeners then went for physical frisking and felt something unusual around his groin area. He was taken to a separate frisking room. Two thin plastic packets of yellow metal paste were found in his underwear,” said a CISF official. Under interrogation, the man initially tried to say he had defecated in his pants as he had stomach upset but later gave away under stringent interrogation. The officials found 1.7kg of gold paste. Around 1.5kg of gold can be extracted from the paste, which is approximately valued around Rs 73 lakhs. Carrying gold in paste form is a new way adopted by smugglers to dodge metal detectors and X-ray machines installed at airports. According to Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) officials, smugglers first convert yellow metal into powder and then produce its compounds in paste form. Around 850 grams of gold can be retrieved from every 1,000 grams of paste.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/1-7kg-gold-paste-seized-at-airport/articleshow/86048680.cms||Tamaghna Banerjee

The programme, which began at 4pm, was conducted virtually from the Sister Nivedita University studio. Over 300 students took part from all over West Bengal. The panelists included RJ Mir from Radio Mirchi, Professor Dhrubojyoti Chattopadhyay, vice-chancellor of SNU, and Professor Minal Parikh, head of department of journalism, fashion, design, fine arts and performing arts at SNU. They held forth on how entertainment can be a crucial part of education in the new normal. Mir dwelt on how digital medium has emerged as the only way to interact with students in tune with the new modes of communication and how ‘working from home’ has blurred the lines between working hours and personal time. It was interesting to note that the pandemic has reduced the number of car listeners, he said. On the challenges posed by the pandemic, Mir explained how young interns at Radio Mirchi had to send audio clips of themselves speaking on certain topics, being forced to stay away from the studios. He talked about students making short films in audio-visual medium and gavebinsights on how radio entertainment had to change its programme, schedule and plans during the pandemic. The industrybunderwent a sea change and the process is still on as producers develop strategies to connect with their audience virtually in a fast-changing scenario. Minal Parikh spoke on how the pandemic has made it difficult to hold on to students and their interests. The problem is compounded for departments that run mostly on practical training. She explained how course modules had to be redefined to bridge the gap between theory and application. Parikh said the content of SNU radio had to be changed completely, and there was a paradigm shift in the content to prioritise the mental health of students. Mir concurred on the importance of mental health and added that being in the right frame of mind is important for productivity. Dhrubojyoti Chattopadhyay said that though the word ‘edutainment’ was coined decades ago, it was never seriously considered before the pandemic. He pointed out that Covid-19 has shifted education from being teacher-centric to student-centric. He added that education should be made more creative to capture the attention of students, and it is the teacher’s responsibility to make sure that she/he is good enough to ensure student attendance. He also stressed that teachers should be innovative in terms of modes of communication. An interactive session saw the panelists taking questions from children. To one on how social media can be used for education, Mir emphasized on sifting the information available on social media and verifying the authenticity of the news before circulating them. He revealed that comedy gained more popularity than serious lectures during the pandemic and light entertainment was a popular choice among all ages. The programme concluded with the outgoing star correspondents sharing their experiences. The students who have been selected as the Times NIE Star Correspondents for the next one year include Madiha Khan from The Heritage School, Saanvi Jain from Sushila Birla Girls' School, Uditi Saraog from Sushila Birla Girls' School, Mayank Mundhra from Apeejay School Park Street, Soham Roy from BDM International, Shriyaa Gangoli from The Heritage School, Mayesura Taiyeba from Calcutta Public School, Baguiati, Zaaera Adil from Jibreel International School, Ishir Narayan from Indus Valley World School, Ashmit Chowdhury from BDM International, Aggniva Roy from BDM International, Subham Mandal from Calcutta Public School, Ritisha Bajaj from Lakshmipat Singhania Academy, Ankita Sarkar from Adamas International School and Ananya Sarkar from MP Birla Foundation Higher Secondary School.

This angered parents and they sought the government's immediate intervention in the matter. Parents told TOI that being insisted to clear fees and conducting tests within just a few days after reopening of schools is an agony and cause to add to their woes. Some parents also alleged that students are strictly told to be in the classroom only after paying the fees. The school authorities allegedly told parents to pay the fees and clear the past arrears of the fee payment otherwise students would not be allowed to attend tests if the fee dues are not cleared. Mohammed Khasim Anjum, whose children are studying in a school in Vijay Nagar Colony, alleged that the prevention measures in the school were not up to the mark and due to that getting infection is likely high, so he has decided to keep their children away from physical classes. He, however, demanded the education minister to look into the matter and ask private schools not to add more burdens to parents. A spokesman for the school said,“Nobody was asked or forced to attend school or write tests. It is upto them whether they attend or not.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/parents-fume-over-no-fee-no-tests-diktat/articleshow/86051277.cms||---

District administration claimed that Cochin Health Care Diagnostic Centre at Edappally was conducting Covid tests illegally and a case would be registered against the lab owner under the Epidemic Diseases Act. However, the lab personnel claimed that they were only operating as a Covid sample collection point and samples were tested in two other NABL-accredited and Covid-testing approved labs. A team led district collector Jafar Malik that consisted of officials from the health department and drugs control department conducted an inspection in the lab on Wednesday. The district collector later warned that similar inspections will be conducted to ensure that all labs adhere to Covid protocols and have necessary permission to conduct Covid tests. The inspection was conducted based on a complaint that the Covid tests were conducted without adhering to Covid protocols. The lab did not have a licence or ICMR approval to perform Covid tests, the complaint said. It was also alleged in the complaint that the lab technicians were working with same PPE kit for several days. District administration said that most of the allegations were true and they found that the Covid test results were not duly submitted by the lab to them. However, sources in the know said that only the labs conducting tests have to submit the Covid results to district administration and sample collection points needn’t do that. However, they have to have a MoU with NABL and ICMR-approved lab for conducting the tests as well proper waste disposal plan besides necessary permission from the health department.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/pvt-lab-sealed-for-violating-norms/articleshow/86048701.cms||---
---||Dehradun||Himalaya Diwas: Environmentalists reiterate the need to stop massive construction activities in U’khand hills||Dehradun: On the ocassion of Himalaya Day, several environmentalists have expressed concerns regarding the ambitious plans of the state and central governments to build projects “at the cost of the Himalayan ecosystem”. Citing the increase in the number of landslides in the state, noted environmentalist Ravi Chopra told TOI, “When Uttarakhand was carved out of Uttar Pradesh in 2000, people had hoped that our state government would adopt a new development model that is in harmony with its mountain system, Himalayan ecology and geology, and nature-loving culture. Unfortunately, successive state governments have followed the same pattern of economic growth as followed by other states in the country. As a consequence, Uttarakhand lost its natural resources and the lives and livelihoods of mountain communities are threatened. The alerts sounded by scientists regarding worsening climate conditions have repeatedly been ignored.” Several citizens’ groups have also expressed dismay over state government’s plan to chop around 28000 trees in Dehradun alone for developmental projects. Jaya Singh and Himanshu Arora from ‘Citizens for Green Doon’, said, “Faulty planning, flouting of building norms, illegal mining, hill cutting, approval of projects at river sources and in watershed areas are destroying our valley’s ecosystem.” In a similar vein, Reenu Paul of Rajpur Community Initiative, said, “Sustainability, biodiversity loss, depleting green cover and indiscriminate hill cutting are our major concerns. Decision-makers should act responsibly towards Nature and strive to protect, rather than destroy.” Meanwhile, several Dehradun locals and activists have objected to the removal of Harveer Singh from the post of the MDDA secretary. They say that Singh was taking corrective measures and made an attempt to reform the prevailing work culture within the MDDA and that he was against illegal constructions and encroachments.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/himalaya-diwas-environmentalists-reiterate-the-need-to-stop-massive-construction-activities-in-ukhand-hills/articleshow/86046599.cms||Shivani Azad

The accused posed as officials of one of the world’s leading online sales companies. The fresh arrests takes the total number arrests for running fake BPOs in the city to well over a hundred in the past four months. A court has granted six days police custody to all those arrested. “Based on a tip off about an illegal call centre being operated at New Alipore, a joint raid was conducted by the detective department’s cyber cell and ARS. All 22 were arrested and several electronic equipment and incriminating documents were seized,” said joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma. “During interrogation it was revealed that the accused persons used Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP) communication systems — particularly through eyeBeam and VICIdial following various scripts — like Refund Script or Australia Tech Support. They introduced themselves as employees of the American giant and informed their victims that a gift money they had won would be refunded later as their security software got crashed. They then accessed computers to set them back to normal,” said an officer. By using softwares like TeamViewer and AnyDesk, they remotely accessed the target computers and compelled victims to pay Australian dollars amounting to $70 to $200 for installing anti-virus. They also collected card numbers, CVV and PIN of the credit cards/debit card.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/fake-call-centre-dupes-oz-nationals-22-arrested/articleshow/86048704.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh

Delta Combat Systems Limited has been allotted 15 hectares of land for its plant at a cost of Rs 150 crore. The company will manufacture cartridges for assault, sniper and INSAS rifles, CQB carbines and other weapons being used by the armed forces. Close quarter battle (CQB) carbines can hit a target within the range of 200 metres, while the INSAS rifle, which is made on the lines of AK-47, had been extensively used in the Kargil War. “The upcoming defence corridor will not only host companies manufacturing missiles and drones, but also firms that make cartridges for arms used by the security forces, frames for polymer frame pistols and safety equipment,” said a government spokesperson. As many as 29 companies have already submitted their proposals to the government for setting up factories in the Aligarh node, and 19 of them have been allotted 55.4 hectare land. The investment by these companies is estimated to be around Rs 1,245.75 crore, said officials. “In addition to this, 11 companies have submitted proposals to set up companies in Lucknow, six in Jhansi and eight in Kanpur nodes of the defence corridor,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/two-defence-firms-to-invest-rs-215-crore-in-jhansi-node/articleshow/86052360.cms||---
---||Goa||Free digital meters for cabs, 15-year domicile must: Goa CM||PANAJI: Agreeing to the demands of private taxi associations, chief minister Pramod Sawant on Wednesday announced that digital meters would be installed entirely free of cost in taxis. Sawant said that GoaMiles taxis would also be fitted with digital meters, as per the demands by private cab operators. Additionally, badges for all taxi drivers will be made mandatory, and will only be issued to those with 15-year domicile in Goa, said Sawant. He said this will help address the grievance of private taxi operators that GoaMiles app taxi drivers are mainly non-Goans, who are benefiting from the taxi business. Also, notices issued to private taxi operators for not fitting digital meters will be withdrawn once they get the meters installed, said the CM. “The taxi associations had made representations to me and various other ministers. Based on these, we have decided to provide meters with data entirely free. Also, they had a demand that meters should also be installed in GoaMiles taxis and that other taxi owners should not be discriminated against. Accordingly, GoaMiles taxis will also be fitted with meters,” said Sawant. He said he had assured taxi associations that a solution for their issues would be found before the Ganesh Chaturthi festival, and that the assurance has now been fulfilled. “It will be compulsory for all taxi drivers to have badges, and only those with 15 years domicile will get badges. There were many complaints from taxi operators that non-Goan drivers are working for GoaMiles. This problem will now be addressed. I had assured them that we will resolve their issue,” said Sawant. He said cabinet ministers and senior party members held a meeting where the taxi operators’ issues were discussed and the solution was found. “All their issues got resolved with the decisions taken,” said Sawant. Transport minister Mauvin Godinho said that as per the earlier arrangement, taxi operators had to fit the meters and then apply for reimbursement. But now they will not be required to apply for reimbursement, as they can get the meter for free at the installation stage itself. “For those to whom notices have been issued, once they fit the meters, we will tell the transport department and get the notices withdrawn,” said Sawant. Godinho said that around 2,500 taxi operators have already fitted digital meters, and another 600 have sought appointments. The meter will help track the cabs and there is a panic button too for the safety of female passengers, he said. “They will get the meter completely free of cost with one year data and backend services. For the data, they would otherwise have to pay Rs 2,500. The provision for meters had already been made in the state budget for Rs 34 crore,” Godinho said. Minister Michael Lobo, who had been backing the demands of the taxi operators, said there should also be no meddling by the government in the existing systems in place for private taxi operators to do business at hotels. “Our demand was that meters should be fitted free of cost and it should not be a competition. In our hotel industry, there is already a system in place for taxi operators. No one should intrude in that system,” Lobo.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/free-digital-meters-for-cabs-15-yr-domicile-must-cm/articleshow/86051288.cms||Gauree Malkarnekar
---||Kolkata||Charge sheet filed in Maidan stabbing case||Kolkata: The detective department has filed a charge sheet in the snatching-cum-stabbing case at Maidan that took place early morning on July 14. All three victims were young morning walkers. The charge sheet was filed on Tuesday, 54 days after the incident. The sleuths have charged both accused. One was charged under the Arms Act for threatening two of his three victims. The incident that left an impact on morning hour policing and the commissioner of police and the detective department chief jointly taking stock of security, saw a young jogger at Maidan being allegedly stabbed and two others threatened at gunpoint in. The two accused — identified as Md Imran alias Totla (33) and Sk Sameer Hussein alias Saboo (33) — were arrested on the same day by the DD team from Entally and Beniapukur. The two accused had robbed Posta resident Govind Vyas (24), who was jogging near Fort William on Red Road, as well as Bowbazar resident Rakesh Rana (49) and SN Banerjee Road resident Sachin Kumar Shaw (21). Cops had promised to submit a quick charge sheet and are likely to seek an in-camera trial of the accused. “We have used evidence from the victims, the other morning walkers present near the scene of crime along with CCTV footage and technical evidence to build this case. We have ensured there are technical reports to press charges under Arms Act,” said an officer. The police top brass also took stock of the new security plan of the area. No less than 45 cops will be present in the area from 5 am in the morning . A total of five PCR vans will be positioned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/charge-sheet-filed-in-maidan-stabbing-case/articleshow/86048753.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Woman at 5-star an ‘escort’, Sachin Waze gave her cash to count||MUMBAI: The mystery woman seen on CCTV cameras with Sachin Waze leaving a five-star hotel in South Mumbai before the controversy over the car explosives case broke out is a 36-year-old single mother who met the cop (then suspended), “a client”, in 2011 through a broker at a five-star hotel when she was working as an “escort”. The woman said she could not remember clearly if Waze had first introduced himself as “Sanjay or Sunil” from Pune. She said after meeting regularly for 2-3 months, he revealed his identity. The woman’s statement is part of NIA’s chargesheet. The woman was seen entering Oberoi Hotel on February 18 and leaving the next morning. She said she went to stay with Waze at the hotel on two occasions in February as he had given her Rs 40 lakh and Rs 36 lakh to sort out and count. She said Rs 40 lakh was first given to her by Waze when he called her to the 4th floor of the police commissioner’s office on February 15 or 16. She had taken the money to her Mira Road home by local train. Waze instructed her to count the money, remove old notes and segregate notes with the serial number “786”. She said when leaving the hotel on February 19, he gave her another bag containing Rs 36 lakh which she returned on February 20 at the same hotel. She said after Waze was reinstated in June 2020, he told her to stop working as an escort as he would now get a “decent income”. He paid her Rs 50,000 for monthly expenses from August 2020. “We used to meet in hotels in South Mumbai,” she said. The woman claimed her unemployed, abusive husband forced her to become an escort in 2008, when her son was 2 months old, and she separated from him in 2013. She said Waze told her he found her different from others as she did not smoke, drink or take drugs. “After a meeting, he kept calling me and wanted to meet me again. The next meeting was after 2-3 days, when he revealed his real name as Sachin and said he is a businessman,” she told NIA. The woman had also operated a bank locker they jointly used and removed Rs 5 lakh on March 18, a few days after Waze’s arrest. She said she gave the money to her brother and asked him to use it to get a good lawyer and secure her bail if her name cropped up. She said she left for her hometown with her son on March 31 but returned the next day after her brother informed her NIA was looking for her. NIA also allegedly found Rs 1.5 crore in one of the accounts of a company, Mayank Automation, in which Waze had made her a proprietor in 2016.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-woman-at-5-star-an-escort-waze-gave-her-cash-to-count/articleshow/86051303.cms||---
---||Goa||Former players back Fifa plan to have World Cup every two years||Panaji: At a gala dinner in Doha on Wednesday night, football greats couldn’t help but speak about the World Cup in Russia three years ago. “It was such a wonderful World Cup, but it’s been so long, we’ve all been missing (the tournament),” Ronaldo, the Brazilian superstar, told reporters during an online media interaction on Thursday. “The whole world comes alive. If you ask (Lionel) Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo if they want to have more opportunities to win the World Cup, I am sure they will say yes.” The two-time World Cup winner and three-time finalist is part of the Fifa Technical Advisory Group which is looking at the impact of a World Cup every two years. There were several other legends in Qatar during the two-day conclave and everyone agreed that a biennial World Cup would do more good than harm. “I don’t think anyone disagreed on the frequency of the World Cup for two years,” said Peter Schmeichel, who had a stellar career with Manchester United and Denmark for 14 years but played at the World Cup just once. “Everyone was on board with that (proposal). The discussions were more on how the calendar should be formed, the number of games, the rest period.” Fifa is set to present a feasibility study of a new World Cup cycle and the task has been entrusted to former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, now Fifa’s Chief of Global Football Development. “The four-year cycle started in 1930 and has lasted until now, for 90 years. The countries who have been at the World Cup are 78 out of 211, which means 133 countries have never been at the World Cup,” said Wenger. The traditionalists will complain about diminishing the value of the tournament by staging it every two years. Wales captain Gareth Bale said new plans will make the tournament “lose that bit of history” but Wenger felt changes were need of the hour. “Times are changing and so are the behaviours. We have to look at what the society looks like (at the moment). It’s a fast society, e-sports, new generation which is used to having quick responses to what they want and what they love. “These reforms are designed for the benefits of fans and players. For the fans because they deserve the right to watch the top competitions more frequently. And for the players, of course, it will reduce travelling (due to two longer international windows), will create more competitive games and less overall games,” said Wenger A total of 166 of Fifa’s 211 member associations have given their backing to Wenger’s research into the idea. It’s not difficult to understand why. Sixty five percent of the member nations, after all, don’t know the joys of being at the World Cup. “By having a more frequent World Cup, you will give opportunities to teams to participate as well to organise World Cups. That’s one of the positive side. “Due to Covid-19, Euro 2020 was held in 2021. It was a fantastic competition and straightway next year, we have World Cup 2022. It doesn’t look to me that there is any problem. It looks like the Euro was already over a long time ago and we are waiting keenly to have the next World Cup,” said Wenger. So far, Fifa has consulted more than 80 current and former players about their reforms with all of the legends in agreement. Among the more popular legends who attended the TAG meetings in Doha include Marco Materazzi (Italy), Roberto Carlos (Brazil), David Trezeguet (France), Pablo Zabaleta (Argentina) and Tim Cahill (Australia). All of them have backed the proposal but the final decision is not in their hands. “Overall, I have got a positive response (from all stakeholders),” said Wenger. “The (final) decision is democratic and will be made by the 211 countries who are affiliated to Fifa. We will continue to consult people. That’s an ongoing process. It’s down to all the federations to decide what will happen.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/former-players-back-fifa-plan-to-have-world-cup-every-two-years/articleshow/86081367.cms||Marcus Mergulhao

Between 2007 and 2019, ICRISAT led a collaboration of partners to deliver the tropical legumes project as part of which 266 improved legume varieties and almost half a million tonnes of seed for a range of legume crops, including cowpeas, pigeon peas, chickpea, common bean, groundnut, and soybean, were developed. “These new varieties have helped over 25 million smallholder farmers to become more resilient to climate change, as well as to pest and disease outbreaks,” it said. The project has been implemented in Burkina Faso, Ghana, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe. In addition to developing these new varieties, ICRISAT also trained 52 scientists that helped strengthen the research capacity of agricultural systems in Africa. Announcing the award, Olusegun Obasanjo, chair of the Africa Food Prize committee and former President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, said, “ICRISAT’s leadership in developing seeds, that not only end malnutrition but also survive in semi-arid areas, is inspiring other agricultural organisations to rethink seed development and farming practices that suit and solve Africa’s agricultural challenges.” Terming the prize as a major recognition of ICRISAT’s work in Africa, ICRISAT director general Jacqueline d’Arros Hughes said, “This reinforces our belief that agriculture can be profitable for smallholder farmers. We dedicate this award to the smallholder farmers in the drylands of Africa, as they are the ones who inspire us with their patience and perseverance in the face of adversity.” She said the institute’s work spanned the entire value chain, from high-end genomics to markets and agri-business in dryland cropping systems.

Speaking at the meet the press programme organized by Ernakulam Press Club on Wednesday, Sreejesh said that he expects that the Maharaja’s College ground would be renovated in such a fashion that it can be used for hockey as well. “Hockey should be encouraged at the school level,” Sreejesh said. The winning of an Olympics medal by the Indian hockey team is expected to encourage hockey all across the country as well as in Kerala. He said that the attitude of constructing buildings on the entire campus of an educational institution without giving adequate space for a playground should be discouraged. “Playgrounds should be made mandatory for schools and educational institutions. Talents should be identified at the school level and they should be provided with all the support. Physical education teachers should be given proper training,” he said. Sreejesh said that he is not thinking about hanging up boots. “The Olympics medal is not the final target,” he said. Winning the hockey world cup to be held in India next year is the immediate target. He expressed his wish to take part in the Olympics to be held in Paris in 2024. “Commonwealth Games and Asian Games are also there. Outstanding performance in Asian Games will ensure direct entry for the Indian hockey team to Olympics,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/will-urge-govt-to-improve-sporting-culture-sreejesh/articleshow/86048737.cms||---

According to the meteorological department, maximum rain of 9.5 cm was recorded in Visakhapatnam in a span of 24 hours. According to irrigation department sources, all major water reservoirs in north coastal Andhra are full to their brim due to the massive inflows. Most of the streams and rivulets in the rural areas are in full spate. Due to heavy rains in the catchment areas of various reservoirs, water levels were pushed up to the highest levels. Irrigation officials are already releasing waters from many reservoirs. Kalyanapu Lova, Tandava, Pedderu, Konam, Raiwada, Thatipudi, Vengalaraya Sagar, Andhra, Vattigedda, Peddagedda and other reservoirs have reached maximum levels. Water level at Peederu reached 136 mts against the 137 mts FSL. Kalyanapulova has reached 459 ft against 460 ft FSL. Water levels have increased in Thotapalli (104 mts against 105 mts), Vengalaraya (393 mts/399 mts), Vattigedda (160 mts/161 mts), Peddagedda (209 mts/213.8 mts) and Konam reservoirs (98 mts/101.25 mts). The greater Visakhapatnam city needs around 90 million gallons per day (MGD) of water supply for drinking and industrial purposes. The city with a population of 24 lakh people reportedly supplies only 60 MGD.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Why Walled City traders are opposed to vendor survey||NEW DELHI: Raising concern over increasing number of vendors on the main road facing Red Fort, traders of Chandni Chowk have requested authorities for action and objected to a vending committee survey. In a letter written to the lieutenant governor, chief secretary, north corporation commissioner, deputy commissioner (city-Sadar Paharganj zone) and other officials concerned, Chandni Chowk Sarva Vyapar Mandal claimed that the road has been declared a ‘no hawking and vending zone’ by the Supreme Court, and the survey would only legitimise the presence of illegal vendors. “It has been brought to your notice that the town vending surveys under Street Vendors Act 2014 are being done in ward numbers 84 and 85, including prohibited areas of city-SP zone, where no vendors are allowed to squat and hawk. The illegal vendors are informed a day prior to the survey and they squat in the prohibited areas to create fake evidence,” the traders’ forum stated in the letter. “In 2000, some areas of Chandni Chowk were declared non-squatting/non-hawking zones by the corporation. It was later approved by the apex court as well. Hawking or squatting in prohibited areas is illegal,” said Sanjay Bhargava, president of Chandni Chowk Sarva Vyapar Mandal. “On Wednesday, when a team came to do the survey on the main road (from Red Fort to Fatehpuri Masjid), we expressed resentment and asked them to do it on internal or connecting roads after verifying facts,” he said further. A senior north corporation official, however, said that the teams were only conducting surveys of hawkers, checking their years of existence in the area and verifying their documents. “The shopkeepers need to understand that the survey of hawkers is different from the survey of probable sites for placing hawkers. We just plan to incorporate all genuine hawkers/vendors in the list and their existence on this road won’t mean that they would be placed on this road only in future,” said the official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/why-walled-city-traders-are-opposed-to-vendor-survey/articleshow/86051355.cms||---
---||Goa||Goa: Illegal call centre at Morjim defrauds US citizens, 13 held||PANAJI: A Goa police team comprising personnel from the crime branch and cyber crime cell apprehended 13 persons accused of operating an illegal call centre from Morjim, Pernem, on Wednesday. The call centre was being used to defraud US citizens. The accused would pose online as US law enforcement authority officials and seek payment from the ‘defaulting US citizens’. The US citizens were made to pay through vouchers, which were converted into cryptocurrency by the accused and then withdrawn by the fraudsters from Ahmedabad as Indian currency. Divijay Rajput and Krunal Sharma were identified as the main accused, who had set up the illegal call centre and also employed other persons to work for them. Police said that the accused persons are mainly from Gujarat and Mumbai, and had started operating recently. The accused would convince their victims that they have committed illegal acts like defaulting on tax payment. “The accused procured personal details of citizens of the US through illegal means and by using computer resource and virtual private networks (VPNs), contacted their victims through an interactive voice response system by impersonating officers of social security administration/law enforcement authority of the US,” police said in a statement. The accused would tell their victims that their social security numbers (SSN) were going to be blocked as they were found involved in a criminal investigation. The victims were then coerced to settle the matter by paying fines in the form of cash vouchers, which were then converted to Bitcoin. On Tuesday, PI Rahul Parab received reliable information that the illegal call centre was set up at Morjim, from where the fraud was being carried out.

The 21-year-old complainant was suicidal when she approached the MHB Colony police station on Tuesday, officials said. The police calmed her down and counselled her. They made the arrest within 24 hours. The complainant was a former employee of A K Goklani, the accused, who runs an online venture. Goklani used to often travel to Mumbai for work. He had a relationship with the woman, who was then his employee, and they tied the knot earlier this year. About seven months later, the complainant found out that Goklani was already married and walked out on him as their marriage was unlawful. “Goklani then created a fake account on Instagram and posted inappropriate photographs and videos of the woman. He also sent these images to her relatives and friends,” a police officer said, on condition of anonymity. Investigators are probing whether Goklani had similarly harassed other women as well, the officer added. “The complainant and her older sister were in tears when they visited the police station on Tuesday. They said that obscene texts were sent to their family members and their phone numbers were posted with obscene messages on web portals,” said the officer. The victim’s sister complained that her wedding was cancelled as a result. The police started their probe by tracking down the login on the fake Instagram account and the IP address used. They found that it belonged to Goklani. A trap was set up and he was arrested while he was visiting Mumbai on Wednesday. A local court has sent him to police custody for two days. Goklani has been charged with voyeurism and defamation under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code, besides provisions of the Information Technology Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-guj-bizman-sends-obscene-pics-of-wife-to-her-kin-held/articleshow/86051337.cms||Nitasha Natu

The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has taken up 10 cases of property tax disputes, pending in courts for 8-10 years, for disposing of through arbitration and generate Rs35-crore revenue. “The move aims at quick recovery of pending dues. Arbitration is an option to resolve the issues amicably. ,” Hemant Rasane, the chairman of the PMC’s standing committee, told TOI. The property tax department, the biggest income source of PMC, is suffering the most from such disputes. The income from cellphone towers and hoardings has reduced drastically because of legal battles. According to Rasane, the arbitration option would be first tried for the recovery of property tax dues. Then other revenue sources, including advertisement charges of hoardings, charges for cellphone towers, water charges and rents of leased out civic properties, affected by legal battles would be taken up. “The decision about arbitration awards would be taken on case to case basis. The solution would be found in such a way that it does not cause losses to the civic body,” said Vilas Kanade, the head of the PMC’s property tax department. “Many of these cases have not even been argued in the courtroom. So, arbitration may help in reaching a conclusion ,” said a senior official of PMC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-eyes-arbitration-to-end-legal-battles-mop-up-revenue/articleshow/86051347.cms||---

The cops arranged a wrecker van within seven minutes and used it to tow a broken down ambulance all the way from the Strand Road-MG Road crossing to the BR Singh Hospital in Sealdah in 19 minutes. “An AC ambulance from Belur — with patient Maya Ghosh, her son Dipak and two female relatives — was rushing towards BR Singh Hospital. It was entering MG Road from Howrah side when it broke down,” recalled an officer. The locals contacted cops. The OC Amaresh Ghosh and additional OC Soumendu Bhattarcharya of the guard rushed to the spot hoping to make a quick intervention. “We initially tried contacting our Karma ambulances as well as a few local ambulances from near the Medical College Hospital, but none could be arranged. So, we arranged for our wrecker vehicle and rushed the ambulance to BR Singh Hospital. We ensured we gave it a green channel with our sergeant DS Hazra leading the way,” said an officer from Howrah Bridge guard. “When the ambulance broke down, I was in panic. But the cops arranged everything. I cannot think what could have happened if they had not been so helpful and innovative,” said Dipak.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/wrecker-tows-ambulance-takes-patient-to-hosp-via-green-corridor/articleshow/86048798.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Mumbai||Mumbai to get India’s 1st Cambridge-affiliated civic school next year||MUMBAI: The path has been paved for setting up both India and South Asia’s first civic international education board school in Mumbai. The pilot Cambridge board-affiliated municipal school, which will offer pre-primary to class VI, will commence in academic year 2022-23. The school’s location is being finalised. With this, the BMC becomes the only municipality in the country to offer a choice of various education boards to students. A CBSE and an ICSE civic school under the banner of Mumbai Public School (MPS) became a reality in 2020-21. This year, another 10 civic schools turned into CBSE. Environment minister Aaditya Thackeray, the brainchild behind the MPS initiative, on Wednesday held a meeting with civic education and Cambridge board officials to proceed with the first Cambridge affiliated civic school. Thackeray, who has studied in an ICSE school, said, “Every child, beyond the economic capacity or background, should have access to world-class education in all municipal schools and to free education.” Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, MPS schools attracted students of parents who lost their jobs and are facing financial crunch. Though MPS schools, like all other educational institutions, are teaching in the online mode, parents are happy with the quality of teachers and education. For the Cambridge school, training of civic teachers has begun and the admission process will begin early next year. BMC’s joint municipal commissioner (education) Ajit Kumbhar said that the location of the school, including infrastructure, is being finalized. The BMC, he said, is committed to changing the perception towards a civic school. “While we are looking at different education boards, state board civic schools are also getting a facelift,” added Kumbhar. There are 1,200 civic schools in the city. Mahesh Srivastava, regional director, South Asia, Cambridge International said the idea is to offer world-class international education to children from underprivileged sections of society. “Cambridge schools tailor the curriculum to the culture, ethos and needs of students,” said Srivastava. There are over 110 private Cambridge affiliated schools in Mumbai. Educationist Francis Joseph, who is coordinating with the Cambridge board to set up the civic school, said plans are also afoot to improve state board civic schools, including the vernacular medium.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/city-to-get-indias-1st-cambridge-affiliated-civic-school-next-yr/articleshow/86051387.cms||Sandhya Nair

Hubballi, which is famous for Ganesha Utsav in Karnataka, like Mumbai in Maharashtra, is losing its sheen for the second consecutive year after Covid pandemic. The government’s order of one idol for one ward has pushed idol makers into confusion as buyers are refusing to buy them. At the other end, youth associations, who used to install public Ganesha idols, are clueless on what to do next. Office bearers are wandering to police stations to seek permission and clarification over the celebration.Shridhar Chitragar, an idol maker in Dharwad, told TOI that people are still in confusion whether the festival is permitted or not. “New guidelines framed by the government have not reached all. As a result, sale of idols has gone below the average. Moreover, devotees prefer idols of lesser price due to financial crisis following Covid. Seeing the situation, we have not increased the price of idols. The government’s restriction on idols bigger than 4-feet, has drastically affected many artisans. Normally, we receive orders for bigger idols in October-December and start working. If the government had told us earlier, we would have saved our time, energy and would have sensitised the customers on the same. Now we are worried about what to do with big idols. The government should compensate us at least by sanctioning minimum price of the idols,” he said. Vishal Wagmode, secretary, All India Tent Decorators Welfare Association, said that all shamiyana suppliers used to get orders three months prior to the 11-day Ganesh festival. “We used to arrange or upgrade required material as per demand of Sarvajanik Ganesha Mandals. This year there was no order at all as the celebration is restricted to 3-5 days, we are just getting a small size pandal and no organisation is placing order for decoration and sound system following government’s norms. Moreover, one idol for one ward has come as another setback for us. Each ward used to witness 10-12 Ganesh idol installations and 4-5 shamiyana suppliers used to serve them. Now only one supplier can serve 4-5 wards and the remaining will be rendered jobless,” he said.D Govind Rao, founder president, Shree Gajanan Maha Mandal, said that many restrictions have discouraged Ganesha mandals this time and every thing is turning into a low-key affair. The city used to witness over 700 public Ganesh idols but this time one can see only around 300 Ganesha idols. Procession was a socio-cultural-economic event to cater to the needs of folklore artists, sound and light workers, florists and many more. As the government has banned processions, they are all losing their earning,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/a-day-ahead-of-ganesha-fest-preparations-still-in-limbo/articleshow/86046710.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai

Most of it was done by 5pm, and then it was time for some final touches. But I loved every minute of it,” he said. “They (the sportspersons) worked so hard to win us glory. What I have done for them is nothing in comparison,” he remarked, looking his usual dapper self as he greeted the guests personally. Neeraj Chopra too gets a taste of his cookingHe served his guests personally, saying, “Food always tastes better if served direct from the cooking vessel.”  The menu included Mutton khara pishori, Laung ellachi chicken, Aaloo korma, Dal masri, Murg korma, Dugani biryani and Zarda rice (sweet dish). Hockey captain Manpreet Singh, a DSP in Punjab Police, said he had heard about Captain’s cooking skills, but the food exceeded his expectations.

Their initial plan to gather 1,000 waste bottles ended in a sizeable collection of 5,000 bottles from which they developed 10 sculptures. Now, they aim to utilize 10,000 bottles for more products. “Not only empty plastic bottles but we are using bottles filled with waste plastic wrappers and polythene bags. Through this we are preventing so much plastic waste from polluting the environment,” said Chaitali Shroff, principal of BM college of architecture. The drive to collect empty plastic bottles was started by BMU’s eco club, headed by Sanjay Jain. Within a short period the club collected nearly 5,000 bottles which the architecture college took up as a challenge to turn the waste into a reusable material with longer shelf-life. Soon the team of designers team up with enthusiastic students and hit upon successful ideas like developing a chess game, bench, chandelier, lamp post, bird feeder, and various other fun sculptures. The students took help from the mechanical engineering branch of the university to develop metal frames for their project. “We used scrap metal to develop these sculptures. We are now trying to use metal that has a long life so that the sculpture can be used for a long period,” said assistant prof, Anand Parmar. Artist Gajendra Majithia, who is known for developing various sculptures in the city, has assisted the students to design and execute the project. “We are trying to work on sculptures that can be used in public places to create awareness. Through this we want to encourage people to stop using plastic bottles,” Majithia added. BMU is continuing its drive to collect plastic bottles, albeit this time not empty but filled with more household non-degradable waste. They are asking donors to bring bottles filled with plastic wrappers, packets that are often dumped carelessly. Attempts are also being made by the university to install such sculptures made from waste at locations where people can see them and also get a valuable message to protect the environment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/architecture-students-turn-plastic-waste-into-furniture-sculptures/articleshow/86046536.cms||Yagnesh Bharat Mehta
---||Goa||Goa: ‘Get wildlife board nod to develop Dudhsagar road’||PANAJI: Holding that “at least prima facie, approval from the national board of wildlife (NBWL) is necessary” for an integrated project of this nature”, the high court of Bombay at Goa has restrained PWD from undertaking the proposed work of turning the kutcha road to Dudhsagar into a pucca road in the protected area of the Bhagwan Mahaveer national park. The court, however, permitted routine repair and maintenance work to the kutcha road, to be carried out after the monsoon and before the start of the tourism season. The bench noted that the works are not routine repair or maintenance works in the protected area, but a project involving upgradation of the existing kutcha road — which can presently be used only in the non-monsoon — into an all-weather road, carried out at a cost of Rs 2.5 crore per km. “This is all proposed to be undertaken at a cost of Rs 31 crore or thereabouts, covering a stretch of approximately 12 km,” the court held. “This means that the project involves expenditure of approximately Rs 2.5 crore per km. Now, all this can hardly be regarded as routine repair or maintenance works on the existing kutcha road.” It held that approval from the NBWL is necessary as per the 2015 order of the Supreme Court in T N Godavarman Thirumulpad v Union of India. “Even the national wildlife action plan provides that in case of any conflict between tourism and conservation interests of a protected area (PA), the paradigm for the decision must be that tourism exists for the PAs and not vice versa, and that the demands of tourism must be subservient to and in consonance with the conservation interests of the PA. While revenues earned from tourism can help the management of the PA, maximisation of income must never override the main goal of tourism, viz, to educate the visitor and create in them a respect for nature.” From the material placed on record, the court found that the “chief wildlife warden (CWW) has not considered whether such a project is necessary for the purpose of the PA. Rather, the material on record, prima facie, suggests that the project is mostly to cater to the almost 4.5 lakh tourists that visit the Dudhsagar water fall by using the existing kutcha road. Therefore, at least prima facie, we are unable to hold that this is some activity in terms of Section 33(a) of the said Act,” stated the division bench comprising justices M S Sonak and M S Jawalkar. Advocate general Devidas Pangam submitted that these works are being executed by the PWD in terms of express directions/requests from the chief wildlife warden (CWW), and added that they have approval from the state board for wildlife. He added that even the recommendations of the standing committee of the NBWL permit such works in a protected area, and stated that such works are necessary for the purposes of effective management of a protected area. Goa Foundation counsel Norma Alvares submitted that the PWD is undertaking the huge project at a cost of over Rs 30 crore only to promote tourism, and submitted that such a project requires approval from NBWL and submitted that Mr Santosh, who filed the affidavit, was never validly appointed as CWW, and that if project works continue, irreversible damage will be caused to the protected area and the wild life. The project involves replacing the kutcha road surface with lateritic soiling with murram duly compacted, and laying interlocking pavers 80mm thick over a 15cm bed of cement and concrete. The project, inter alia, involves providing cross drains, ramps, parking bay, retaining walls, culverts, crash barriers, and random rubble masonry. In addition, the project involves providing a toilet block, guard room, etc.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/get-wildlife-board-nod-to-develop-dudhsagar-road/articleshow/86051357.cms||Lisa Monteiro
---||Delhi||Delhi: Integration of RFID system with Fastag to lower toll burden||NEW DELHI: South Delhi Municipal Corporation, which is the nodal agency for toll-tax collection and the implementation of the RFID-based project, plans to integrate its own RFID database with national Fastag. Mayor Mukesh Suryan told TOI that that the move would help in cost reduction for commercial vehicle operators who need to purchase a separate chip for Delhi borders. The project, which was earlier being monitored by the Environment Pollution (Prevention & Control) Authority, now falls in the jurisdiction of the Commission for Air Quality Management in NCR. A senior municipal official said Badarpur border entry point would be the first step towards this integration. “There are two toll collection systems of the municipal corporation and the National Highway Authority of India, which are barely 60-70m from each other. The integration of two systems is the need of the hour at this border point. The current system is leading to traffic jams and queues between the two tax-collection points,” the official stated. Delhi has 124 border entry points where toll tax is levied. Of these, the RFID system has been installed at 13 major border entry points, which are used by almost 80-85% of the commercial vehicle traffic entering the city. “The Badarpur and Rajokri border entry points are one of the biggest in terms of commercial vehicular volume. The trucks and commercial vehicles entering from Faridabad need to pay the taxes twice. This will be the first preferred site for this integration, while Rajokri border will be covered next,” the official said. The ambitious RFID project has failed to deliver the intended goal of digital tax collection and reduction of traffic jams or congestion at major border entry points. The official stated that the integration at one border point will cost Rs 1-1.5 crore.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/integration-of-rfid-system-with-fastag-to-lower-toll-burden/articleshow/86051490.cms||Paras Singh

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: High-end cars, SUVs may miss the festival bus||AHMEDABAD: Siddharth Singh, an entrepreneur, wanted to drive home a new SUV this Diwali. Having read about the increase in waiting period for cars, he planned a purchase in advance. “I had surveyed various showrooms and finally booked an SUV on Janmashtami,” Singh said. “Despite insisting on delivery on Diwali, which is over two months away, the dealers have not given me a confirmation. They told me there are supply constraints due to the ongoing semiconductor shortage.” Singh hopes that luck will shine on him this festive season. People looking to make muhurat purchases of cars this festive season — for Navratri, Dussehra, or Diwali — may not be able to drive home their new cars even if they make their bookings now. The global semiconductor shortage has caused component shortages and left dealers with shrinking inventory as passenger vehicle manufacturers have downsized production. Semiconductors are crucial in the manufacture of electronic components such as power windows, music systems, and several controls. According to the data released by Federation of Automobile Dealers’ Association (FADA), about 20,501 cars were retailed across Gujarat in August. While car sales grew 8.9% year-on-year, the demand has shot up so much that sales clocked an 18.97% growth against the pre-pandemic August 2019 number (17,232). “The upcoming festival months are the peak season for car sales. Demand has begun showing positive signs, but we are unable to capitalize on it due to supply constraints,” said Jigar Vyas, CEO of an Ahmedabad-based car dealership group. Vyas added: “There is a 70% reduction in the inventory we get from the dealers while the demand is going up.” According to car dealers, the only inventory available with them is that of entry-level cars and in some cases, mid-segment cars. The shortage is acute for SUVs, high-end sedans and other high-end cars for which the waiting time has shot up from two months to four-six months, according to industry estimates. “Average inventory of cars held by dealers has gone down from 45 days to ten days due to the short supply from car manufacturers,” said Pranav Shah, chairman, Gujarat region, FADA. The shortage has influenced customer preference. “Customers who wanted a specific model are now becoming flexible and turning to other brands or models,” said Jinmay Shah, business head at a city-based car dealership. “Some are also deferring purchases. So dealers are losing business.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/high-end-cars-suvs-may-miss-the-festival-bus/articleshow/86048862.cms||Niyati Parikh

The non-IT sectors — hitherto under strain, such as retail, real estate and infra — also contributed to the monthon-month (MoM) growth in talent demand, HR firms said. On a year-on-year (YoY) basis, the job market has expanded over 50% from August 2020, which acted as the month of recovery last year.  Ankit Agarwala, MD of HR consulting firm Michael Page India, said that while MoM growth in new jobs has been marginal, YoY open white collar jobs are almost 60% up. Sectors like real estate, medical devices and retail, which had been slow in recovery till July, have seen “a good amount of jobs” being added, Agarwala noted. He said that rising activity in the startup world has also opened up many new jobs. Naukri.com’s monthly job market index JobSpeak stood at 2,673 in August — up almost 89% from the same month last year. Job listings portal Indeed said hiring activity is at a prepandemic level and, as on September 1, job postings represent an 8% growth over the baseline of February 2020. Job listings portal Indeed said hiring activity is at a pre-pandemic level and as on September 1, job postings on the portal represent a 8% growth over the baseline of February 2020. Roles such as data scientist, statistician and analysts saw a 43% increase year-on-year in August. Engineering (40%), HR (37%), retail (28%) and finance (22%) were other functions where postings witnessed an increase, Indeed data showed. Specialist staffing firm Xpheno notes that the job market in August was flattish compared to July after a steady climb for almost three months. The month saw the highest number of announcements related to planned fresher and lateral hiring, capacity expansions, and new ventures, Xpheno's jobs report said. "The growth [in jobs] is holding up as vaccination is keeping pace, and many corporations have also announced capex plans. BFSI, e-commerce and FMCG showed green shoots in August," Kamal Karanth, founder, Xpheno, said. Interestingly, the firm noted a correction in remote jobs that dipped around 18% as companies increasingly prefer to hire candidates in the same cities. According to TimesJobs’ monthly recruitment index RecruiteX, automotive, BPM, and IT/telecom led the MoM talent demand in August making 4%, 4% and 3% gain respectively.  “With the relaxation of Covid curbs, August saw non-IT sectors contributing most to the MoM growth of talent demand... This was propelled jointly by relaxations in regulations, festive offerings and increased sales,” Sanjay Goyal, business head, TimesJobs and TechGig, said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/job-market-expands-in-august-too-hits-pre-covid-level/articleshow/86053527.cms||Sindhu Hariharan

Ramesh of Budatanapalli zilla parishad high school exhibited his project through a virtual system on September 4. Around 581 students contested in the national level and exhibited their projects. He was one among the 60 students, including six from AP, selected for the President Award at the national level. According to the district education officer (DEO) K Nagamani, the son of the daily wage laborers designed toilets in a limited space in a triangular shape as against the traditional square or rectangle. “Usually, the septic tank of the toilet is in a rectangle shape. But he designed the septic tank in a cylindrical shape for higher storage space with low-cost construction,” the district science officer Balla Srinivasa Rao said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/vizianagaram-boy-bags-national-inspire-award/articleshow/86051383.cms||Siva G
---||Amritsar||Punjab: Three Union ministers BJP poll incharge||BATHINDA: Facing a stiff protest from farmers over farm laws, the BJP has appointed Union jal shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat as Punjab BJP in-charge and Union ministers Hardeep Singh Puri, Meenakshi Lekhi and MP Vinod Chavda as co-in-charges of the party in Punjab, which is expected to go to polls in early February along with Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. The move is being seen as an effort to make BJP come out of the woods in Punjab and instil confidence in state leaders to go out for electioneering, said a party leader, who did not wish to be named. Amid the ongoing struggle against farm laws, the BJP leaders had been finding it very hard to come out and mingle among people for electoral reasons. After the farm organisations had given a call to hold protests against them, Punjab-based BJP leaders had been facing tough time for close to a year now. Under such circumstances, appointing three ministers is aimed at the confidence building measure and also to make it alive politically and stay in the reckoning, said the party leader, not wanting to be named. BJP is learnt to have chalked out a plan to start electioneering and reach out to people. Initially, BJP leaders from Punjab Surjit Kumar Jyani and Harjit Singh Grewal had been working as a bridge between the central government and farm organisations when the farmers had started opposing the three contentious laws and had ensured start of meetings which went on till 11 rounds, even though no solution was found. The situation against BJP had reached such a stage after farmers had publicly stripped party MLA Arun Narang at Malout a few months ago. The party now wants to make rapport with electorates belonging to various sections of society, the leaders said. Punjab BJP president Ashwani Sharma said, “Earlier, BJP used to contest only 23 seats and this time, the party is contesting all the 117 seats. So bigger central representation was needed to guide the party unit and it (appointing 3 ministers) should not be seen as unusual. All the leaders are experienced and well versed with Punjabi traditions, their experience will take Punjab BJP further. The party is working on the ground at smaller level and when the time comes, the bigger rallies will be organised too.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amritsar/3-union-ministers-bjp-poll-incharge/articleshow/86051397.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Mumbai||Mumbai: Low-income wards lack green spaces, finds climate study||MUMBAI: A stakeholder consultation meeting held on Wednesday to draft Mumbai’s Climate Action Plan called for increasing the city’s green cover and biodiversity in a planned and inclusive manner. World Resources Institute (WRI) India, in a presentation, said Mumbai’s per capita accessible open space stands at 1.08 sq m/person much lower than the Urban and Regional Development Plans Formulation and Implementation norm of 10-12 sq m/person for Indian cities. It discussed the need for having a local biodiversity strategy and action plan like Kochi. TimesViewParks have always been bottom of Mum bai’s civic agenda—the city’s open space quotient has long been among the world’s lowest. That must change. In an era of rising temperatures, trees and open spaces will be critical to cooling the air, sponging up rainwater, absorbing carbon, and improving quality of life. Authorities must protect existing green spaces and create accessible new ones to help the city cope with climate change.Lubaina Rangwala, associate director, urban development and resilience-WRI India, said in 2018, 31% of the city’s total land area had an average surface temperature of 30.5 Celsius or higher, a 174% increase from 1988. “A study by WRI India highlighted that slums are 5-6 warmer than their neighboring housing societies,” she said. “Green space availability varied amongst wards. In Mankhurd, a low-income area, green spaces are mostly wetlands, whereas higher economic zones, like Pali Hill, have more accessible open spaces in the form of parks. There is a high demand-supply gap in open spaces.” Only wards like A (Churchgate), D (Malabar Hill) and G-South (Worli) are currently able to meet this gap. Experts said only restorati-on and conservation of natural ecosystems could help increase the city’s resilience and capitalize on the sequestration potential of trees and open spaces. Stalin D of Vanashakti said BMC needs an independent environment experts’ panel. Sucharita Roy, head-planning & building at Aga Khan Agency for Habitat India, said: “Today developme-nt is taking place on a large scale and we could try to see if this can be done in a guided way wherein urban greening is a part of the process by means of rooftop and vertical gardens.” Debi Goenka of Conservation Action Trust called out the indiscriminate pruning of trees across the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-low-income-wards-lack-green-spaces-finds-climate-study/articleshow/86051411.cms||Richa Pinto

In 75 of the 82 wards in the recently concluded election to the HDMC Council, NOTA polled votes in double digits, while in six wards, NOTA registered votes in triple digits. In all, as many as 5,199 residents across the twin cities opted for NOTA.In fact, in few of the wards, more voters opted for NOTA than they did for several of the candidates, while in a few others, those who rejected all the other candidates decided the winner. The margin of victory in many of the seats was equivalent to the number of votes registered against NOTA. Activists and political observers have pointed out that NOTA is likely to play a decisive role in deciding the outcome of polls to urban local bodies (ULBs) in Karnataka.Advocate and citizens’ rights activist Basavaprabhu Hosakeri said that the preference among a significant number of voters for NOTA was indicative of their unhappiness with the candidates selected by the parties. “People are not concerned about policy whilst voting in the ULB elections. The people are familiar with the candidate, at least to some extent, and when they opt for NOTA, they are making it clear they are unhappy with all of them. It is unlikely that NOTA will ring in sweeping changes in the electoral process, but it will certainly serve as a warning to parties to be more careful in choosing their candidates. When 100 people opt for NOTA, parties must understand that there are as many people who have rejected all of them,” Hosakeri said.Echoing some of Hosakeri’s observations, activist Dr MC Sindhur said, “Opting for NOTA may not have an impact on the overall outcome or affect the chances of the winning candidate. But those opting for NOTA are giving a warning to the parties. Right now, it is a tool through which we can express dissent about the electoral system but it has to be strengthened to get our opinions to matter.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/over-5k-people-opted-for-nota-in-twin-cities/articleshow/86046790.cms||Sangamesh Menasinakai
---||Chandigarh||Keen to meet leaders of farm unions, sort out their doubts: SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal||SAD has been facing backlash from farmers over its initial support for the three contentious farm laws, so much so that it has put its election campaign on hold. The party had put pressure on its rivals by taking a lead and launching ‘Gal Punjab Di’, but now put its rallies on hold for a week after the Moga incident. It wants to meet the farm union leaders to put forth its point and answer their queries. SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal tells TOI’s Neel Kamal that his party’s 100-day outreach programme will not be affected by “sponsored protests of the Congress and the AAP.” Excerpts:Farmers’ opposition has become the biggest roadblock in your 100-day ‘Gal Punjab Di’ campaign.I want to make it very clear that it is not the anger of farmers (that we are facing). It is coming from our political opponents — the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party. Thousands of people attend our rallies and most are farmers. But there are only around 20 to 50 holding protests. We can’t compare these 20 to 50 with thousands of farmers sitting in the rallies. It is not farmers versus Akali Dal, but all the other parties versus Akali Dal. You put the number at 20 to 50, but in reality, hundreds join these protests as was evident from the Moga incidentWhat I meant is that at some places there are 20-odd people protesting, at some 50, at others 100 or may be 200 or 300. At Moga, it was a clash between protesters and police, not us. At the root of these protests are leaders of Congress and AAP, as we have collected details and found people of Baghapurana Congress MLA Darshan Bar among protesters. Likewise, zila parishad members, councillors and leaders of APP (have been spotted among the protesters). We have a list of these people and their photographs with us. Then why don’t you file a complaint and demand action against those persons?Some senior police officers have told me in confidence that they have clear instructions for allowing protesters ‘to do their job’. Some officers clearly said that chief minister Amarinder Singh wants this and that their (police) hands are tied. The violence in Moga during your rally was the first such incident in Punjab and farm groups have given the state government a deadline for withdrawing the case linked to it.The clash was between the protesters and the police; we are nowhere in the picture. But, we have no problem if the case is withdrawn. It is for the government to investigate the matter and if the case is withdrawn, as per the demand of farmer groups, we have no objection to it. Most Punjab farm groups feel the launch of early electioneering may adversely affect their protest. Some have even said that they are against holding assembly elections before their longstanding issues are resolved.We have not started early. Only three and a half months are left for real time electioneering and even out of that, farmers will be busy with paddy harvesting and wheat sowing for one-and-a-half months. We are left with only 55 days for electioneering, to go to every constituency. We have to make plans, frame policies for the welfare of all sections of the society, and for that, we are meeting the people to get their feedback as to what needs to be done — for them and for Punjab. It is not early if we look at the time left to reach out to the people, to listen to them in the right earnest. We have never intended to harm the ongoing farmers’ agitation against the central farm laws. Wrong perception is being created by Congress and the AAP. We are the only party in Punjab which is with the farmers. But farm organisations say the political parties should start electioneering two months before the polls.See, practically we don’t have much time. Once the election code of conduct comes into force, parties get involved in nominations and other related things, which takes away 10-12 days and serious campaigning is not done then. Last time, we started campaigning a year before the elections. In West Bengal, it started a year-and-a-half before the assembly elections. In 2017, AAP had started campaigning a year before the elections. Farm unions are still questioning SAD’s strong support of the Centre’s controversial farm bills.We have formed a three-member committee of senior leaders. We have already written to the farm leaders to tell us where we can meet, as we are ready to answer all their queries. We are ready to explain our past actions, present and future actions pertaining to the farm laws. We are the ones who withdrew from the (Union) government, resigned from the ministry, returned awards and what not. We want to alert farmer organisations that some parties are trying to misuse their name and put guns on the shoulders of farmers to defame them in the eyes of the central government. We want Punjab to remain peaceful. How do you see Muzzafarnagar mahapanchayat and its pan-India impact?The mahapanchayat witnessed a massive turnout of farmers, which is a clear message to the Union government to fall in line and listen to the farmers or they may throw you out. It will crush the ego of the BJP government. You and former minister Bikramjit Majithia have alleged that the Punjab government is working in cahoots with central agencies to create trouble in Punjab in order to impose the President’s rule.Things are crystal clear. Captain Amarinder Singh is left with only four months (in CMO). He has no future and the way Congress high command put Navjot Singh Sidhu above him, he does not have much to do and is now with the central government. This suits the Centre as they have a target of making parties fight against each other. Agencies like RAW and IB are working on it, to prepare the ground for imposition of the President’s Rule in the state. Then, the BJP can work as it wants and also crush the support to the farm struggle. Your party has been a supporter of federal structure and more rights for the states. You were planning to cobble together a front of parties opposed to BJP and Congress.We are working on it and have been in talks with other parties. A strong alternative to BJP and Congress will emerge before 2024 and the results of assembly elections in Punjab and UP will play a decisive role in the formation of this front. Do you find any difference between Congress and BJP as far as centralisation of power is concerned?BJP, now, is completely a one-man or two-man party. The top leadership of Congress has finished the party. Every political party has a face, Rahul Gandhi as the Congress face destroyed it with his inefficiency. Modi destroyed the BJP because of his autocratic nature. That’s the difference between the two. In other states BJP is accused of communal polarisation.I believe communal harmony is most important for Punjab, being a border state. We have never witnessed sectarian violence in the state. We believe in the teachings of our revered Gurus, who preached ‘sarbat da bhala’ (welfare of everyone). The Gurus sacrificed lives for others, which is the biggest asset of Punjab. No force, not even the BJP, will succeed in it here. Your tie-up with BSP has led to a strong undercurrent of unhappiness in the Punjab BSP cadre over the choice of seats.Every time someone fails to get the party nomination, some problems crop up. But the SAD-BSP alliance for the polls is going 99.9% strong and if there is any problem it will be sorted out. SAD has been demanding the sacking of a few Punjab ministers on charges of corruption. Which of the ministers should be removed and why?We 100% demand sacking of ministers involved into corrupt practices, like Sadhu Singh Dharamsot who is accused of scholarship scam, Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, the health minister is accused of getting prime land near Mohali and so on. We are preparing a list of ministers and others involved in corrupt practices. Whosoever is into corruption should not be spared. Akali Dal is accused of inking PPAs which are hurting Punjab.We had inked power rates at Rs 2.80 and Rs 2.86 with IPPs and now people are paying Rs 9 for every single unit. It is the wrongs of Congress government which need to be looked into. And even if the PPAs are to be quashed, we have no problem with it but there should be an alternative arrangement for power. Do you think the case of theft of bir of Guru Granth Sahib, sacrilege and subsequent incidents could have been handled differently?As then demanded by Congress and Sikh organisations, we had handed over the cases to CBI to find the truth. We acted only as per the demands of many. We always wanted the truth to come out and whosoever is behind all this should be finished. The Congress, in its four-and-a-half years, has had only one intention — to frame the Akali Dal and the Badal family, for whatever wrongs have been done by anyone. Former DGP Sumedh Saini was chief director of the vigilance bureau during the SAD-BJP tenure. Do you now think that appointing him as Punjab DGP ultimately hurt you politically?It is the protocol of the police department that the senior-most officer is made the head of the organisation. We only followed that.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/keen-to-meet-leaders-of-farm-unions-sort-out-their-doubts/articleshow/86051464.cms||Neel Kamal
---||Nagpur||HC takes up issue of public lands being encroached, regularized||Nagpur: Censuring civic bodies for regularizing public utility plots either encroached or leased by private parties, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Wednesday expressed concern over the way such illegalities are committed by the authorities in power.The court was hearing a 14-year-old case filed by Jagjitsingh Saddal and others, contending they were not allowed to construct anything on their plot as it was reserved for playground and primary school. A division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Kilor said the issues thrown open for consideration by this petition are of “very serious nature”.“These issues cry for resolution in the best interest of Nagpur residents or in other words, in the larger public interest. We would like to consider this matter further, especially from the point of view of ordering an enquiry into illegalities committed by planning authorities and their officers,” the judges warned.Pointing out various orders passed by the HC, the bench said all those broadly point towards illegalities of grave nature committed by Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) officials.“This is the reason Anilkumar was already appointed amicus curiae. Before a detailed order is passed, it would be necessary that the entire petition record is produced before us. We direct NIT and NMC to remit entire record and proceedings related to auction of plots, granting sanction to development of leased plots and everything that pertains to development plans (DP)reservation for the petitioners’ plots by next hearing.”Before adjourning the hearing till 2 pm on September 9, the justices directed NMC commissioner and NIT chairman to personally look into the case and ensure that entire record and proceedings of DP reservation of petitioner’s plots are submitted before that and any failure would be viewed seriously. “One of the illegalities, which has been prima facie found to have been committed consistently over a long period of time, is of leasing out lands reserved for specific public purpose such as open spaces and play-grounds, for private use. In HC’s earlier order of July 7, 2018, it was observed that since 1987, instead of curbing illegal layouts and developments, under the guise of policy decisions, the layouts and encroachments are being legalized at the cost of general public.”Quoting its order of October 31, 2018, the judges lamented that while a law-abiding citizen is required to pay huge amount for purchasing a legal plot, the reserved or PU land or playground in vicinity is made available illegally by the planning authorities or is allowed to be encroached upon only to be regularised by accepting regularisation or compounding charges by these authorities.“Today, the situation is that after having brazenly leased out portions of the land under reservation, which form part of petitioner’s plots, NIT has sent a proposal on October 21, 2015, to the state regarding deletion of reservation in order that the illegalities committed are pushed under the carpet and a cloak of legality is created by so-called regularisation of the illegalities,” the HC said.BOXWhat HC said* Legalisation of encroachment is of very serious nature* Resolution required in best interest of residents of Nagpur* May probe illegalities by planning authorities and officers* NIT & NMC to remit entire record & proceedings relating to auction of plots* PU plots reserved for open spaces & playgrounds leased out to private parties* Instead of curbing illegal layouts, these being regularized at public’s cost||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/hc-takes-up-issue-of-public-lands-being-encroached-regularized/articleshow/86048949.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Congress worker beaten by party colleague||AHMEDABAD: A 32-year-old man, a Gujarat Congress worker, on Wednesday filed a complaint at Ellisbridge police station alleging that a party colleague assaulted him on Independence Day at the Gujarat Pradesh Congress office in Paldi. Jagdish Rajpurohit, a resident of Isanpur, who runs an advertising agency in Ellisbridge, stated in his FIR that he filed a police complaint after party leaders did not take any proper action against the accused, Kiran Prajapati, who is vice-president of the Gujarat Congress Sewa Dal and a member of the Ahmedabad school board. Rajpurohit said that the Gujarat in-charge of Congress Sewa Dal, Rakesh Shetty, had come to party office on August 15. Rajpurohit said he wanted to meet Shetty, who was in conference hall at the party office. When he opened the door of the conference hall, Prajapati told him not to enter and when Rajpurohit objected, Prajapati began abusing him. Rajpurohit alleged that Prajpati assaulted him and instigated other party workers to hit him, after which he left. He said that he raised the issue with Congress Sewa Dal president Lalji Desai and later before Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee (GPCC) president Amit Chawda, but the party leaders only sent a notice to Prajapati and did not expel him. After this, he submitted an application of complaint to Ellisbridge police on September 1. Ellisbridge police on Wednesday registered a complaint against Prajapati for causing hurt, use of abusive words and criminal intimidation .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/cong-worker-beaten-by-party-colleague/articleshow/86048978.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Rural students’ net woes: HC warns Centre & state||Nagpur: Expressing concern over poor school students from remote areas being unable to continue studies in the absence of internet connectivity and power supply, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Wednesday granted a last chance to the central and state governments to inform it about steps taken to resolve their problems.“We direct respondents to file replies, which would include steps taken in providing adequate learning equipment/facilities, like reliable network providing internet connectivity and electricity supply consistently on 24x7 basis, especially after March 21, 2020, when the nationwide lockdown was imposed due to Covid-19 outbreak,” a division bench comprising justices Sunil Shukre and Anil Kilor said.In case of failure to file replies, the bench warned they may consider summoning Union cabinet and state chief secretaries to remain personally present or alternatively, they would impose heavy cost on the respondents.The directives came while hearing suo moto PIL based on letters by ten school students hailing from remote villages in backward Gadchiroli district to HC chief justice and senior administrative judge at the Nagpur bench. They highlighted their plight on not being able to attend online tutorials due to lack of electricity and internet connectivity. They sought help to resolve issues faced by hundreds of students like them residing in such remote areas across the state.Earlier, amicus curiae Firdos Mirza, while quoting Section 5 of the National Food Security Act, 2013, highlighted that poor and migrant students were not receiving their mid-day meals due to closure of schools since over one-and-a-half years. He demanded directives to both governments for alternatives to providing nutritious meal to the school children.The amicus also raised important questions arising from right of every child of age of 6-14 years to free and compulsory education in neighbourhood schools till the completion of his/her elementary education, as provided under the Right to Education (RTA) Act, 2009. “In remote areas, the school buildings are not proper, teaching staff is unavailable in sufficient number, the learning equipment are not provided and facilities necessary for getting education are also absent. In many areas, where all-weather roads are not available, the children are unable to go to the school during rainy season,” the judges pointed out .While adjourning the hearing for three weeks, the bench added that the PIL highlighted various issues regarding absence of facilities. “It would be, therefore, necessary in public interest that a serious consideration is accorded to these important issues by the centre and state, and also local authorities, which it appears to us is lacking up till now,” the judges said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/rural-students-net-woes-hc-warns-centre-state/articleshow/86048921.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure
---||Ahmedabad||Covid effect: Public transport use halved||AHMEDABAD: Public transport services in the city — the Ahmedabad Municipal Transport Service and the Bus Rapid Transit System — in early March 2020 had a cumulative daily ridership of 7.25 lakh passengers. Now, their ridership has fallen below half, to just 3.5 lakh. AMTS and BRTS have resumed full-fledged operation but bus passengers are yet to return. A senior officer said said the city once had bus ridership of more than 8.5 lakh per day, but with the introduction of BRTS, total ridership had gone down. The officials said that on Tuesday, BRTS has 1.05 lakh riders and the AMTS had 2.5 lakh. AMC officials said the average ride distance was 8km, which means more people are going for longer trips and are avoiding public transport for shorter trips. Officials said despite the BRTS vehicles being airconditioned, the system has failed to draw new passengers. Officials added that in the absence of an effective public transport system, the business of shared rickshaws is flourishing and vehicle density in the city is also increasing. The two regional transport offices (RTOs) of the city, at Subhash Bridge (GJ-01) and Vastral (GJ-27), together saw more than six lakh new vehicles registered since the beginning of 2019. These RTOs have a total of 32 lakh vehicles registered. Officials at the Subhash Bridge RTO said registrations in the last two years have been largely in the four-wheeler segment and two-wheeler registrations are slowly getting back to near pre-pandemic levels. The officials said that the fear of Covid in the last two years has taken riders away from public transport. AMC officials, however, pointed out that the AMTS has been continually reducing the number of buses on the road and has merged several short routes, which has reduced passenger numbers on public transport. Officials in the AMC said they are waiting to see what the response to the metro is when full-fledged operations begin in the city. They say the metro will definitely eat into AMTS and BRTS ridership numbers, as the metro will not be able to attract users of private vehicles because it will not provide adequate parking facilities and connectivity.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/covid-effect-public-transport-use-halved/articleshow/86048928.cms||---

I supervised the area and was getting into my car when the attacker lunged at me with the knife. He had aimed at my neck but I swiftly raised my arm in defence due to which my fingers got chopped and I suffered injuries on my wrist and head,” said the official. Recuperating at her Thane house, Pimpale told TOI that the attack seemed pre-mediated and a handiwork of the land mafia. “It is unlikely that any hawker would get so violent. The attack was to scare me but I will continue my work against illegal structures with renewed vigour and zest,” she said, adding that the attacker should get the sternest punishment at the earliest.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thane/attacker-had-aimed-for-my-neck-recounts-thane-amc/articleshow/86051488.cms||Manoj Badgeri

---||Chennai||Tamil Nadu government passes resolution against CAA after opposition walkout||CHENNAI: The Tamil Nadu assembly on Wednesday passed a resolution urging the Centre to repeal the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019. Chief minister M K Stalin said the legislation enacted by Parliament was not in tune with the secular principles laid down in the Constitution and not conducive to the communal harmony that prevailed in the country. Main opposition AIADMK was not present in the House when the resolution was passed, while the BJP walked out in protest. The resolution moved by Stalin said, “As per established democratic principles, a country should be governed taking into consideration the aspirations and concerns of the people belonging to all sections of society. But it is clearly seen that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act was passed in such a way that it does not accord a warm support to the refugees considering their plight, but instead discriminate them according to their religion and country of origin.” The assembly resolved to urge the Union government to repeal the law to protect and ensure unity and communal harmony in the country and to uphold the secular principles enshrined in the Constitution. When leader of the House, S Durai Murugan said the opposition, the AIADMK, “ran away” from the House, as they did not have the courage to oppose (the CAA), Stalin intervened to correct him and said the AIADMK “did not have the courage to support the resolution”. The Union government should completely abandon the task of preparing the National Population Register as an extension of the amendment to the Citizenship Act, the chief minister said. The DMK, in the election manifesto, had promised to pass a resolution against CAA. “If those from Pakistan and Afghanistan could come, why ban Lankans? This is the greatest betrayal against Lankan Tamils, who could not live in their country and escaped to Tamil Nadu, living in rehabilitation camps and outside. This law is taking away the rights of those, who do not want to go back to their country, and are keen on getting citizenship in India. This law discriminates people on the basis of ethnicity,” Stalin said. The chief minister said citizenship was the legal right of every human being and added that citizenship must be granted to all those who live in the country. The government cannot deny legal equality and protection to any person, any citizen, within the country, he said. “As per the Citizenship Act, 1955, religion is not the basis to obtain citizenship. But, the amendment, brought by the Union government, has made religion the basis,” he said. When the Constitution said that India was a secular nation, laws cannot be enacted based on religion, Stalin said. The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, seeks to make migrants, Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan, eligible for citizenship. “But Muslims have been deliberately omitted. The DMK opposed the legislation at the preliminary stage itself since it divides the people on religious basis,” the chief minister said. The DMK had urged the previous AIADMK government to pass a resolution against CAA in the assembly ahead of the Union government enacting the law, but the latter did not agree. The DMK and its allies voted against the bill in the Parliament. “Discrimination against refugees who have lost their lives and are unable to live in their own country is like subjecting them to greater misery,” Stalin said. Stalin said India’s independence was achieved because everyone fought together from Himalayas to Kanyakumari. BJP floor leader Nainar Nagendran said the law was not against Muslims. Under the Nehru-Liaquat agreement of 1950, India and Pakistan were to ensure the rights of minorities. While India has been following that, Hindus and other minorities in Pakistan, who comprised 20% at the time of partition, have been reduced to 3% now. “The rights of minorities are affected in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh and they could come to India,” Nagendran said. Welcoming the resolution, PMK floor leader G K Mani said that denying citizenship to Sri Lankan Tamils in India was a big shock. “They should also be protected,” he said. Durai Murugan said the resolution was not to oppose the Union government.

It said that foreign ownership of Indian government bonds (IGBs) has been declining but 2022 would be the turning point that could bring an acceleration of bond inflows. “The GBI-EM and Global Aggregate indices are likely to include India in early 2022. We expect oneoff index inflows of $40 billion in 2022-23, followed by annual inflows of $18.5 billion in the next decade, pushing foreign ownership up to 9% by 2031,” the report said.  It said that the opening up indicates policymakers’ desire to push growth rates higher through investment. It will push India’s balance of payments into a structural surplus zone, indirectly create an environment for a lower cost of capital and ultimately be positive for growth, the report said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/india-may-be-part-of-global-bond-indices-in-2022-morgan/articleshow/86053690.cms||---

The police are also searching for two more men booked in the same case. Police said Ghate has stated in his complaint that Vitul alias Vicky Waman Kshirsagar (33), one of the arrested men, wanted to eliminate him to make way for Vicky’s elder brother to contest the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) elections. Kshisagar, a resident of Ambil Odha, was earlier working with Ghate and left him about five years ago. Manoj Sambhaji Patole (30), also from Ambil Odha, and Mahesh Indrajit Aaglave (25) of Lohiyanagar, are the other two arrested suspects. On Wednesday, the police produced the trio before a city court which ordered their custodial remand till Thursday. A team headed by DCP (crime) Shrinivas Ghadge and inspector Abhay Mahajan arrested the trio after Ghate approached the police on Monday. When contacted, Ghate told TOI, “I have requested the police to go to the roots of this conspiracy and arrest all suspects. Civic elections are impending and this is not a way to defeat a candidate. It a politically motivated conspiracy and they were planning to eliminate me.” In his statement to the police, Ghate said that he and his close associate Amar Sabale had gone to a restaurant on Lal Bahadur Shashtri Road in Sadashiv Peth last Friday . Within few minutes, three men occupied a nearby table. As the three men kept looking at Ghate, the corporator and his friend became suspicious. Sabale looked outside the restaurant and found Kshirsagar and the other man standing nearby. Sabale called a friend to the restaurant so that they could safely leave the spot. Police said on Saturday and Sunday, Ghate and his associates gathered CCTV footage from the restaurant and spots on Lal Bahadur Shashtri Road. “After studying the footage, Ghate came to know that the suspects had been following him for the past few days,” said inspector Mahajan. Ghat stated in the FIR that Kshirsagar’s elder brother is a member of a political party and wants to contest the civic elections. “We are questioning the trio and are yet to recover any weapons,” Mahajan said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bjp-corporator-alleges-murder-plot-ahead-of-civic-elections-3-arrested/articleshow/86051540.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat HC notice to AMC over cancelled bid||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Wednesday issued notice to the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) over a petition challenging the municipal commissioner’s decision to cancel the bid for a plot at the Sindhu Bhavan Road on the ground that the bid received was not very high as compared to the base price fixed for the auction. In June, one Shrestha Infraspace LLP offered Rs 1,88,300 per sq m for a 8,060 sq m plot that was auctioned by the civic body. The base price fixed by the AMC was Rs 1.88 lakh per sq m. The deal was to be struck at Rs 151.76 crore, but the civic body cancelled the auction on the ground that the price that the plot fetched was just Rs 300 more per sq m than the base price fixed. This would fetch the civic body Rs 24.85 lakh more than what it had estimated. The cancellation of Shrestha’s bid did not go well with the company and it approached the HC arguing that once the bid is even Re 1 more than the base price, the authority does not have a grounds to cancel the bid on the ground that the deal was not fetching a good price. This is because the seller has fixed the base price, and whether the offer is Re 1 or Rs 50,000 more than the base price, the bid is legal. The court has asked civic authorities to reply on this issue by September 14.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/hc-notice-to-amc-over-cancelled-bid/articleshow/86049042.cms||---
---||Ahmedabad||Jungle tale: Encroaching humans, unhidden conflicts||AHMEDABAD: Encroachments in forest areas and increasing big cat population are among the factors that have escalated human-animal conflicts in Gujarat, pushing up people’s deaths to a decadal high. The latest data of the state’s forest department shows that 28 people lost their lives in 2019-20 in animal encounters, taking the toll up 47.3% from the previous year when the state recorded 19 deaths. The figure of 28 deaths was last registered in 2011-12. As many as 205 people lost their lives between 2010 and 2020. “Of the 205 deaths, 106 or 51.7% of the total were in Junagadh alone,” said a senior forest department officer. “In all, 1,310 cases were reported in which people received injuries in the same period.” The officer added: “Of these, 718 cases or 54.8% of the total were from Junagadh.” The officer said that the state government has paid Rs 5.35 crore in compensation for human deaths and injuries during the period in question. Of that, Rs 2.85 crore was paid to Junagadh victims. Experts said that most human deaths and injuries were the result of leopard attacks and only a small number were caused by lions.  “Lions do not attack humans unless they are threatened. A lioness with cubs may get aggressive,” said H S Singh, a member of India’s National Board for Wildlife and an expert on Asiatic lions. Singh went on to say: “Leopards are stealthy and tend to attack humans. Every year, only one or two lion attacks are reported while the remaining attacks are attributable to leopards, sloth bears, and crocodiles.” Singh said that a majority of lion attacks are on cattle. In all, 36,568 cases of cattle deaths and injuries were reported in the state between 2010 and 2020. Of these, 28,071 or 76.4% were reported in Junagadh. A few days ago, a video of two lions hunting down a cow on the side of a busy road in Bhavnath in Junagadh had gone viral. R D Kamboj, a former director of the Gujarat Ecological Education and Research (GEER) Foundation, said that leopards have been traditionally known for attacks on humans while the number of lion attacks have been miniscule. A senior forest department official said that the reason behind the increase in human-animal conflicts is the shrinkage of the natural habitats of lions and leopards and the rise in the big cat population over the years. Officials said that the leopard population in Gujarat rose to about 3,200 in 2021 from 1,395 in 2016. The lion population in the state was 674 in 2020, up from 523 in 2015. According to the Forest Survey of India, the forest cover in Gujarat stood at 14,857 sq km in 2019, up by about 100 sq km from 14,757 sq km in 2017. However, the open forest area slipped drastically by 200 sq km in 2019. Open forests are the natural habitats of Asiatic lions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/wild-death-map-human-animal-toll-mauls-record/articleshow/86049068.cms||Soumitra Trivedi

---||Ahmedabad||Gujarat: Biological, adoptive parents fight for girl’s custody||AHMEDABAD: A 16-year-old girl’s adoptive parents and biological parents have moved the Gujarat high court in a legal battle for her custody. The case is from Jamnagar district, where a couple had given their daughter for adoption to their uncle and aunt, because the older couple did not have a child then. Later, the adoptive parents had a girl born to them and the biological parents began asserting their rights over their daughter. During the hearing before the bench of Justice J B Pardiwala and Justice V D Nanavati, it was submitted that the biological parents took custody of the child when she was at school in August 2011. Since then, she has been living with her biological parents, who also claimed before the court that the child is not willing to leave her biological parents. As the dispute between the biological and adoptive parents grew worse, the biological parents moved a local court and demanded that the adoption deed be cancelled. On the other hand, the adoptive parents insisted on enforcement of the adoption deed. The adoptive parents have been arguing that there is no law under when the adoption deed can be cancelled, and thus they will remain the parents of the child and responsible for her all her life. The dispute twice reached the high court but remained unsolved. The judges told the lawyers that the girl is 16 years of age and in two years she will attain majority, so both parties should allow her to decide with which set of parents she wants to live with. The judges also said that such litigations are very painful, “In the fight between the biological and adoptive parents, we don’t want the girl to suffer, and that is for sure.” When the high court insisted that both parties try to reach an amicable solution to the problem, the lawyers from both sides expressed inability and the court was informed that there was a case of assault, for which one of the litigating parties was convicted and sentenced to jail. He is out on bail and is contesting hard for the custody. Upon hearing this, the judges said, “You continue to fight. Let them draw swords but spare the girl.” As the lawyers continued to insist on the hearing, the judges reiterated their request for an amicable solution and said, “Even the judgment is not going to solve the problem.” The court finally decided to hear the case at length on Monday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/biological-adoptive-parents-fight-for-girls-custody/articleshow/86049073.cms||---

---||Delhi||Delhi: How elevated taxiways will help IGI cut CO2 emissions by 55,000 tonnes annually||NEW DELHI: Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) – the operator at Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA) – has estimated that the construction of the dual elevated cross taxiways (ECT) is likely to reduce CO2 emissions by 55,000 tonnes annually. The project is scheduled to be ready by December 2022. DIAL said once the 2.1km-long dual elevated eastern cross taxiways were completed, they would help decongest the airport and reduce turnaround time for airlines, with passengers also having to wait inside the flight for a shorter duration after landing or during takeoff. A DIAL official said that, at present, an aircraft had to cover a distance of around 9km after landing at runway 29/11 or to takeoff from the same. After commissioning of the ECT, the aircraft taxiing distance is set to go down considerably, dropping down to just around 2km, as the plane will taxi along the taxiway parallel to runway 11/29 and use the ECT to take a straight path to Terminal-1. One runway is likely to be used to go from T3 to T1 and vice versa. The ECTs have been designed on a similar plan as those seen at Singapore’s Changi airport. “The ECT will also help airlines save approximately 350kg of fuel every time an aircraft uses the taxiing route provided by the ECT from runway 29/11 to Terminal-1 and vice-versa. This would translate into a reduction of nearly 1,114kg of CO2 emissions for each aircraft taxiing along this route. Annually, the ECT is estimated to reduce emission of approximately 55,000 tonnes of CO2 from aircraft,” said a DIAL spokesperson. In March 2021, DIAL started mounting of girders of the ECT across the pillars in the median of the Central Spine Road. A total of 590 girders are to be mounted for the project. By the second week of July, over 200 girders have already been mounted, officials say. “Construction of the dual eastern cross taxiways, the first of its kind in India, will not only reduce significant amount of carbon emissions but also enhance passenger experience. This is another step towards our goal of becoming a net zero carbon airport by 2030. The ECT, an integral part of Delhi Airport’s Phase 3A expansion project, would make it future-ready. After completion of this project, the airport would be able to handle 140 million passengers per annum,” said I P Rao, deputy managing director, GMR Group.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/how-elevated-taxiways-will-help-igi-cut-co2-emissions-by-55000-tonnes-annually/articleshow/86051716.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

The PMPML was prompt in carrying out a survey after the August 17 accident to identify dilapidated bus shelters. “The survey identified 37 ‘Pune pattern’ shelters - among the oldest. Before bringing them down, we require authorisation from senior officials. The file regarding the same was moved on Tuesday. Once we get the green signal, the process of replacing them will start,” a transport body official said. Bus stop at Tilka RoadHe said that there has been some delay as the officials concerned were on leave. “Some of the Pune pattern bus shelters are in Pune and Khadki cantonments and letters have been sent to them to remove weak structures. We are likely to start the action in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits soon,” the official added. Another transport body official said that no such survey was carried out in the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) limits. “There is no need as all the bus shelters there are made of stainless steel,” the official said. Pratham Kandu, a daily commuter, said, “The transport body is playing with the lives of the people. Despite knowing that these shelters are risky, the PMPML has not removed or repaired them,” he said. Sanjay Shitole, an active member of the PMP Pravasi Manch, said, “On the one hand, they are quick to come up with modern smart shelters in posh areas like the FC Road, but have not taken any steps about old risky shelters. The rains have started. What will happen if another shelter falls?” he asked. A PMPML official claimed that they wanted to be sure about the fitness of these structures and have told the team to check properly. “The first time the team had identified eight to nine shelters, but when we told them to check again, they found quite a few shelters deemed to be dangerous,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmpml-yet-to-remove-or-repair-37-risky-bus-shelters/articleshow/86051611.cms||Joy Sengupta

Following the revelation, NMC’s transport department has withdrawn these buses from city roads. According to information, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) is operating 290 buses on 85 routes with the help of four operators — RK City Bus Operations, Hansa City Bus Operations (Nagpur) Private Limited, Travel Time City Bus Operations and Olectra Greentech Limited. While three of the operators run 94 buses each, including 15 mini, Olectra is operating only six ladies special electric buses. An NMC official said the fitness certificates of 18 buses, including 15 mini, run by RK City Bus Operations expired between March and July this year. In view of the Covid lockdown, the ministry of road transport and highways had in June this year advised the enforcement authorities that validity of fitness, permit, licence, registration or any other documents may be treated to be valid till September 30, 2021. Taking advantage of the relaxation, RK City continued to operate the city buses without fitness certificate, ignoring the fact that the central notification was not enforced in Maharashtra. Besides, one more bus was found being operated without mandatory PUC certificate. After learning about the lapse, Aapli bus programme manager — Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System (DIMTS) Ltd informed the NMC’s transport department and removed these buses from service. “When the RTO office has become fully functional, the operator should have renewed the fitness certificates of its buses,” said the official. The official also said each red bus operator has 150 midi, 15 mini and a few standard buses. “Had the buses been maintained properly, the operator could have replaced the buses put on hold due to the expiration of the fitness certificate. The inability to replace them has exposed that the operator is not maintaining the bus fleets, said the official. It is very serious matter that RK City is plying buses without fitness certificates. The entire management system of the firm is inefficient and credibility of the firm is under doubt, said official sources. In the past, drivers engaged by this firm to operate Aapli buses had alleged irregularities in disbursing their salaries.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/operator-found-running-19-aapli-buses-sans-valid-certificates/articleshow/86049182.cms||Proshun Chakraborty
---||Pune||Maharashtra: Task force advises govt to open schools for children’s well-being||PUNE: Paediatricians have urged the state government to reopen schools on account of the behavioural issues being exhibited by children following months of staying at home during the pandemic. Pramod Jog, state paediatric Covid task force member told TOI hyperactivity in children has increased and there is no scope of diverting or channelizing their energy after socializing came to zilch in many cases during the pandemic. “We have noticed an increasing incidence of lack of discipline or routine among children since schools have been shut. Also, there has been an increased use of cellphones and internet, with issues such as internet gaming addiction, internet dependence increasing. Learning difficulties are worsening, with some children also reporting sleep related problems, school phobia, social anxiety and speech delay because of speaking to fewer people in the last 16-17 months,” he said. Many children have been away from academics and spending a considerable time on social media and online gaming. “Too long a time away from school may also worsen incidence of school phobia and school refusal among some children. Schools should thus be reopened with adequate Covid precautions, as was recently suggested by the Maharashtra paediatric Covid task force,” Jog added. Mrudula Phadke, senior adviser, National Health Mission, Unicef, and former vice-chancellor of Maharashtra University of Health Sciences said that children have been locked up in their houses since months, without exposure to the school environment and their peers. “Outdoor play time has reduced and television/mobile screen time has increased enormously. This has resulted in children avoiding talking to those around them, with some starting to exhibit depressed or violent behaviour. The prolonged school shutdown and lack of socialization have also affected eating patterns, such as over eating or lack of interest in food,” she added. There has been a significant digital divide with secondary autistic changes in few cases, she said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/task-force-advises-govt-to-open-schools-for-childrens-well-being/articleshow/86051650.cms||Neha Madaan
---||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body defends Rs 15-crore penguin tender||MUMBAI: The BMC on Wednesday defended its Rs 15 crore tender for maintenance of the penguin enclosure at the Byculla zoo. The BMC claimed that after the arrival of the penguins, its revenue from the zoo had increased dramatically. It claimed that the income from the zoo increased by Rs 12.26 crore from Rs 2.1 crore after the penguins were brought here in 2017. “Certain sections of the media yesterday have reported allegations made by elected representatives of some political parties regarding loss of crores of rupees to BMC on account of upkeep of penguins in Veermata Jijamata Bhosle Zoo. The total cumulative income of the zoo between April 2014 and March 2017 was Rs 2.1 crore. However, after the arrival of penguins in March 2017, the total cumulative income of the zoo between April 2017 and March 2020 was Rs 14.36 crore. Therefore, it is clear that the income of the zoo increased by Rs 12.26 crore,” municipal commissioner Iqbal Chahal said. “The total value of the tender for expenditure on penguins was Rs 11.46 crore. It is amply clear that the increase in the income of the zoo after the arrival of the penguins is much more than the expenditure on maintenance of penguins in the zoo,” Chahal added. BJP MLA Ameet Satam said: “The question is not about income to the zoo due to penguins and its expenditure. The question is about rigging the overly priced tender to Highway Construction, which has been penalised by Lokayukta in the penguin matter, and to help it reap huge benefits out of this tender, which is drafted without doing proper rate analysis.” Congress corporator Ravi Raja said: “This kind of high maintenance cost is not justified at all. The BMC is spending more for maintenance than on hospitals. It must carry out a peer review on the cost of penguin maintenance.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-penguins-brought-zoo-rs-12cr-ok-to-spend-rs-15cr-on-them/articleshow/86051676.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

---||Ahmedabad||Why object if ‘love jihad’ complainant wants to stay married: HC to Gujarat govt||AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Wednesday asked the state government to explain on an affidavit why it is objecting to quashing of criminal charges including violation of anti-conversion laws against the husband, in-laws and the priest for solemnizing the marriage even after the victim asserted that the FIR was not true and that she wanted to continue with her matrimonial life in the state’s first Love Jihad case. The case is from Vadodara. The FIR was registered against seven persons including the husband two days after the Gujarat Freedom of Religion Act was amended on June 15. Four persons accused in this case including the husband are still behind bars and the woman told the HC, “If they are not enlarged on bail, it would result in derailment of the matrimonial relationship between the informant (victim) and her husband who want to live together as a married couple.” During the hearing on Wednesday, the woman presented herself before the bench of Justice I J Vora and reiterated that she has voluntarily filed the petition demanding quashing of the FIR. The state government objected to her demand and this led the court to direct the government to file an affidavit by September 20 to explain grounds on which it objects to the demand made by the victim and seven accused persons. The woman has submitted in her petition that she had gone to Gotri police station to report certain petty and trivial issue due to her matrimonial discord which she believed can be covered under Section 498A of the IPC. “However, at this stage, certain religio-political groups intervened in the matter and communalised the issue by bringing in the angle of Love Jihad. Also, on account of the overzealousness of the police officers involved, facts and offences which were never mentioned or alleged by the informant came to be inserted in the FIR,” the petition reads. The victim expressed her shock over addition of rape and sodomy charges in the FIR. She also said that she did not approve of invocation of charges for forcible conversion and then under the Atrocities Act a couple of days after she filed the complaint. She also complained that her affidavit clarifying that the FIR mentioned grossly incorrect and untrue facts were not accepted by the lower courts while refusing bail to the accused. The victim and her accused husband have submitted that they were in relationship since 2019 and they had knowledge about each other’s religion. They solemnized marriage according to Islamic rites and rituals and got the nikahnama notarized. Few days later, they also got an agreement registered in which they decided to get their marriage registered under the Special Marriage Act and the agreement also reflected assurance from both the sides that they would respect the faith followed by their partners. Their families also know about their relationship and the woman’s father stood a witness to their marriage, but “…the allegations in the FIR have been communalised and sensationalised by overzealous police officers at the behest of religio-political groups.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/love-jihad-hc-tells-govt-to-clarify-objection/articleshow/86049316.cms||---

The accused had allegedly poisoned his mother three years ago. The son and three others were arrested on Tuesday night, police said. The incident occurred at Mau village under Majhola police station limits on August 29. The body was recovered from the house the next day. He was strangled to death, the autopsy report stated. Earlier, Dharampal - in his late 40s - had mixed poison in his mother's food and killed her in 2018. He was "let free" due to lack of evidence then, sources said, adding now, after "several attempts", he killed his father, identified as Gajraj Singh. During questioning, the accused confessed to his crime, police said. An FIR was registered against Dharampal, his two sons Aniket and Rajat, and nephew Ankit under IPC sections, including 302 [punishment for murder]. The property dispute dates back to 1994. Dharmpal was infuriated with his father for selling off the ancestral property without his consent. He was afraid that his father would give it all to his sisters, which "forced him to kill his father", police sources said. The accused son was earlier booked under IPC section 307 [attempt to murder] following his father's complaint in 1994, but couldn't be arrested due to insufficient evidence. On Wednesday, Moradabad SP Amit Kumar Anand said, “An elderly man was found dead in his house. A case was registered based on a complaint by Dharampal against one of his relatives. However, the initial probe found his relative to be innocent. A thorough probe was then initiated. And the autopsy stated the cause of death to be strangulation. The suspect was taken into police custody and during questioning, he confessed to killing his father for property and said his two sons and a nephew assisted him.” The SP city added, “The accused also confessed of trying to kill his parents earlier, too. He had offered money to a truck driver to run over his father after a failed bid to poison him.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/ex-village-pradhan-75-killed-by-son-over-property-dispute/articleshow/86041752.cms||Maria Khan

The Congress alleged that BMC funds were flowing freely in the G-North (Dadar, Mahim) and G-South (Lower Parel, Worli) wards, both of which are Shiv Sena strongholds. TimesViewThe BMC has recently announced a slew of projects in the Dadar, Mahim and Worli. While these projects are welcome, the BMC must ensure that funds are distributed equitably for projects across the city. At the same time, there should be a cost analysis of fancy projects so that BMC funds are used judicially at a time when the civic body is facing a financial crisis due to falling revenues.Kalina corporator Tulip Miranda of the Congress complained to municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal and mayor Kishori Pednekar that injustice was being meted out to residents of Kalina as the BMC was not sanctioning funds for the revamp of the Joseph (Kaka) Baptista Garden. “The pond in this garden, also known as Kalina Talao, needs restoration. But whenever we seek funds, we get a reply saying that there is a paucity of funds and repairs can’t be taken up right now. But, at the same time, the BMC just carried out a revamp of Mahim beach with a gym. There is a stepmotherly treatment to Ward No. 90 in Kalina. The amount of funds being spent in the G-North ward in the last two years are beyond the understanding of all corporators,” Miranda said in her letter. Tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray is the MLA from Worli, which falls under the G-South ward. The MLA from Mahim, which is in G-North, is Sada Sarvankar of the Shiv Sena. A majority of corporators from these two wards are also from the Shiv Sena. “Just because Aaditya Thackeray is the MLA from that constituency and minister for tourism, is it rightful for the BMC to spend funds only in the G-North and G-South wards and neglect the demands of the other wards? I demand that funds for the revamp of Joseph (Kaka) Baptista Garden are approved immediately. This garden was built on a dumping ground and is the only open space in the area,” Miranda said. The BMC has also faced a lot of flak for a Rs 168 crore cycle track that it plans from Mahim Fort to Bandra Fort. Both the Congress and the BJP have opposed the plan, calling it exorbitant. The Congress claimed that the original cost of the Mahim Fort to Bandra Fort cycling-track-cum-walkway as planned by urban planners and citizens was only Rs 20 crore, which the BMC hiked to Rs 168 crore. Opposing the massive hike in the cost of the project, the Congress demanded a detailed rate analysis of the project along with peer review by engineers from institutes like the IIT-Bombay and VJTI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-funds-flow-in-sena-heartland-drought-in-other-parts-cong/articleshow/86051755.cms||Chaitanya Marpakwar

Mayor Muralidhar Mohol said a joint meeting of elected representatives, mandal workers and MahaMetro officials will be held. “I have contacted Metro authorities with a suggestion not to proceed with the work till the discussion takes place. We will explore some possibilities,” said Mohol.  The work to launch the girders has been planned for this week and MahaMetro has mobilised machinery and equipment at the bridge. Corporator Aba Bagul said the Ganesh processions have been going via Lakdi Pul for decades. “We have already demanded that the civic chief hold a joint meeting. The existing plan of the viaduct will obstruct the decorations and chariots. Advanced technology can be used for the stretch above Lakdi Pul. We do not want MahaMetro to continue the work till there is some decision,” Bagul said. Bagul said that he along with mandal workers visited the site late on Tuesday and urged Metro workers not to continue the work.

The 3.5-acre property and a bungalow originally belonged to film music director Gangai Amaran, who was forced to sell it to Sasikala in 1994, during J Jayalalithaa’s first term as chief minister. It, hence, became part of the Rs 65.66-crore disproportionate assets case against Jayalalithaa and Sasikala. As per the order, a copy of which was pasted on the compound wall of the property on Wednesday, Sasikala and her family members are prohibited and restrained, until further orders, or till 90 days from the end of month from the date of notice under Section 24(1), whichever is earlier, from transferring or charging the properties mentioned in the order, as per the provisions of Section 24(3) of The Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Act, 1988. They (Sasikala and her family members) are hereby prohibited from taking any benefit under such transfer or charge, the order said. The order is undersigned by U N Dilip, the deputy commissioner of Income Tax (Benamis Prohibition) initiating officer. The order was addressed to V K Sasikala, a resident of Habibullah Road, T Nagar, J Deepak of Sivagnanam Street in T Nagar, J Deepa of Sivagnanam Street in T Nagar, and the sub-registrar of Thiruporur. In October last year, the IT department had attached the 900-odd acre Kodanad tea estate and a farm house at Siruthavur, standing in the name of J Ilavarasi and V N Sudhakaran, the disowned foster son of Jayalalithaa. So far, the income tax department has attached a total of 84 properties, in two phases, together worth more than Rs 1,900 crore belonging to Sasikala and her relatives under the The Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Act, 1988.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/i-t-dept-attaches-sasis-omr-bungalow-under-benami-law/articleshow/86051801.cms||Selvaraj A

The ruling went against an argument of the Ahmedabad-based manufacturer of branded parathas, Vadilal Industries, that — as rotis are subject to GST at 5% under HSN code 1905 — the same should also apply to parathas. Vadilal had said, “Chapattis, rotis (fulkas) and parathas share a close resemblance to one another, as not only the method of preparation or cooking but even the manner of use and consumption are same and similar for all such products.” In June last year, TOI had front-paged a similar ruling given by the Karnataka bench of the AAR, which had broken the internet. The hashtag #HandsoffPorotta was then trending on Twitter. In this case, the applicant Vadilal Industries submitted that it produces eight varieties of parathas— the principal ingredient in all is whole-wheat flour. It may constitute 62% of the ingredients in Malabar paratha or 36% in mixed-vegetable paratha. The Gujarat AAR bench sought to distinguish between ready-to-eat food preparations like ‘khakhra, plain chapatti or roti’, which fall under HSN code 1905 and attract the lower rate of 5%, and parathas which require heating and are ‘ready-to-cook’ preparations. The cooking instructions on the packets sold by Vadilal stated, “Heat on a medium flame for about 3-4 minutes.” It also called for adding oil or butter during heating for additional taste and crispness, pointed out the AAR. It also distinguished between rotis and parathas on the basis of composition of wheat flour, which in case of parathas varied from 36% to 62%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/ready-to-cook-parathas-face-18-gst-aar/articleshow/86053772.cms||---

The first major infrastructure upgradation project undertaken by Adani Airports at the airport has suffered a second delay, according to sources. At first, the project was expected to be operationalised in mid-July. However, sources said that due to delay in construction work and pending approvals, the same got deferred. In the second stage, the finishing work of premises was completed, and the terminal was expected to be operationalised in the first week of September. However, sources confirmed that the new cargo terminal is still to be operationalised. An email query sent to Adani Airports, which manages the city airport’s operations, management and development, asking for reasons for delay in operationalising the terminal, did not elicit a response. The new cargo terminal is being set up by merging the existing cargo terminal with terminal 3, which was earlier the Haj terminal, from where flights ferrying Haj pilgrims operated. However, there is no clarity as yet on part of the city airport authorities regarding setting up of a terminal for Haj flight operations. The city airport handles an estimated 50,000 metric tonne of international cargo every year, according to estimates provided by Ahmedabad Air Cargo Complex. Sources confirmed that SVPI Airport handled 60,749 MT of air cargo volumes in FY 2020-21, which is lesser as compared to the preceding year, when it clocked 103,741 MT in FY 2019-20.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/svpi-cargo-terminal-launch-delayed-again/articleshow/86049293.cms||Niyati Parikh

Statistics provided by the Central Railway show that occupancy was less than 50% in August. Barring September 5, which was a Sunday, the occupancy has been low this month as well so far. On the other hand, the vistadome coach has been popular among passengers on the Pune-Mumbai route, with occupancy touching 95%. Sources in the railway said that since the train leaves Mumbai in the evening, the response is poor. “The train starts from Mumbai at 5.10pm and arrives in Pune at 8.25pm. People feel that when the train passes through the Karjat-Lonavla ghat section, it will be dark and they will not be able to see anything,” the official said. Another railway official said the Deccan Queen is popular and Railways is hoping that the vistadome coach attracts more passengers once the pandemic situation normalises further. “On Sunday the coach had decent occupancy on the Mumbai-Pune route. The Railways will observe the response for three to four months,” said the official. The fare of a seat in the vistadome coach on the Deccan Queen is Rs 915. Jaideep Malviya, who recently travelled in the coach from Pune, said it is best suited for early morning travel to view the Western Ghats. Sandeep Dixit, who travels to Pune on weekends, said the scenery cannot be enjoyed in the evening. “The ticket prices are high and with nothing visible, it is better to travel on a regular coach,” said Dixit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/few-takers-for-vistadome-coach-on-deccan-queens-mumbai-pune-trip/articleshow/86051807.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Delhi||Delhi: First monthly report on how effective Connaught Place smog tower is to be out on October 15||NEW DELHI: The first monthly report on the effectiveness of the Connaught Place smog tower is likely to be ready by October 15. The data will be collected from September 15. While the smog tower was made operational on August 23, officials said readings were not being logged as monsoon conditions often create “artificial” readings with particulate matter settling down after a spell of rain. Delhi government would be undertaking a two-year pilot study to assess how effectively the smog tower can reduce PM2.5 and PM10 concentration in its vicinity throughout the year. A senior Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) official told TOI the tower was functioning well, but the showers had largely interfered with the data being collected. “We realised that air quality was already good after a spell of rain and that data may not be accurate when one is looking to assess a before and after drop in pollution readings. After some early testing, it was decided that readings will only be collected from September 15,” added the official. DPCC said it plans to display PM2.5 and PM10 reduction using a digital board outside the smog tower, which would provide transparency in the change in air quality numbers. “Such boards are already being used across the city to display AQI and other parameters. We will be showcasing real-time data from the smog tower through the boards,” the official said. During the two-year pilot study, monthly reports would be released by DPCC and assessed by Delhi government. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, who inaugurated the Connaught Place smog tower last month, had stated that more such towers would be installed across Delhi only if it was found to be effective. “This tower has been established as a pilot project and detailed studies will be conducted on its performance. IIT-Delhi and IIT-Bombay will analyse the data and submit a report on its effectiveness. Once satisfactory results are received, the model can be replicated in other parts of the city,” the CM had said. The tower stands at a height of 24 metres and is said to clean up to 1,000 cubic metres of air every second, influencing an area of 1 sq km around it.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/first-monthly-report-on-how-effective-cp-smog-tower-is-to-be-out-on-oct-15/articleshow/86051845.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok
---||Kozhikode||IUML disbands Haritha’s state panel||Kozhikode: IUML has disbanded the state committee of Haritha, the girl wing of MSF that had raised serious allegations against three male MSF leaders of making anti-women and sexually coloured remarks against their leaders. The decision was taken at the high-power committee meeting held in Malappuram on Wednesday on the grounds that Haritha state committee was continuously violating party discipline. IUML state general secretary PMA Salam told the media that the decision to dissolve Haritha state committee was taken as they had committed gross indiscipline. The stern action by IUML shows that party leaders have taken a strong offense at the refusal shown by Haritha leaders to comply with the party directive to withdraw the complaint they had lodged with the women’s commission against three MSF leaders, including state president PK Navas. On Aug 26, IUML leadership had announced a ‘reconciliation pact’ under which Haritha leaders were to withdraw the complaint but the party had limited action against MSF leaders to just an expression of regret. The three leaders including Navas, Malappuram district president Kabeer Muthuparambu and district general secretary VA Wahab then expressed regret over social media. The party had also revoked its earlier decision of freezing the state committee of Haritha. But, Haritha leaders remained firm in their demand for disciplinary action against MSF leaders and refused to withdraw the complaint. Haritha leaders had felt that they hadn’t received justice as IUML hadn’t taken disciplinary action and the regret expressed by the three leaders actually amounted to disparaging them as there was not even a sincere admission of having committed a wrong. Justifying the decision, PMA Salam said that the tenure of the Haritha state committee, which came into existence in 2018, has also ended. “It had to be renewed every year, but it was not done and as such its tenure has also ended. The party state committee will soon nominate a new committee,” he said. The earlier decision by IUML against the aggrieved women by freezing the girl wing had drawn widespread flak. Extending support to Haritha leaders, MSF national vice-president and founding general secretary of Haritha, Fathima Thahiliya had said in August that natural justice was denied to Haritha leaders. Acting on a complaint, Vellayil police had registered a case against MSF leaders under IPC Sections 354 (1) (iv) (making sexually coloured remarks) and 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman). Ten Haritha leaders had submitted a petition to the women’s commission, which was forwarded to Kozhikode police chief. IUML meeting also discussed an action plan that was prepared by a 10-member subcommittee to strengthen the party in the wake of the lacklustre performance in assembly election. The report will be tabled before party state committee on September 26. IUML district president Panakkad Sadikali Shihab Thangal presided over the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/iuml-disbands-harithas-state-panel/articleshow/86049312.cms||---

Ashok appointed him after seeking copies of his Adhaar card and other necessary documents. Within a month he had become familiar to Ashok’s family members, especially Yash. Before taking Yash with him, Patel had also stolen the copies of his Adhaar card and other details from Ashok’s diary. Verma said that Patel’s criminal history was being collected with the help of Prayagraj police. As per the initial information collected by the police it was found that Patel had gone to jail in past in many cases of vehicle lifting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/cops-rescue-abducted-boy-arrest-kidnapper-in-a-few-hours/articleshow/86047150.cms||---
---||Nagpur||Gorewada Zoo begins breeding tigers in safari||Nagpur: The Balasaheb Thackeray Gorewada International Zoological Park in the city began a new chapter on Wednesday by pairing female and male tigers — Lee and Rajkumar — in their Indian Safari enclosure spread over 25 hectares. The initiative by FDCM managing director N Vasudevan will give visitors a double delight, to sight two tigers in the open. However, veterinary scientists are thinking differently. The two tigers were released in the safari in December last but were never set free jointly, out of the fear that the male tiger may kill the female. The safari opened on January 26, 2021. “The whole idea about the experiment is to allow mating and breeding of the two. Even Recognition of Zoo Rules, 2013, states that every zoo shall endeavours to acquire mates for single and unpaired animals on a priority basis. It is also a biological need of the animals,” says Dr Shirish Upadhye, director, Wildlife Research & Training Centre (WRTC), Gorewada Rescue Centre. This will be the second ex-situ conservation experiment of tigers by the Forest Development Corporation of Maharashtra (FDCM). Earlier, on February 23, 2018, 12-year-old hand-reared Lee, after mating with disabled male Sahebrao, had delivered four cubs but killed all of them. This was due to poor maternal care. The cubs were to be shared with Maharajbagh Zoo equally. “Lee was brought to the rescue centre from Maharajbagh in July 2017 for breeding. This is the second time after over three years she will mate with six-year-old Rajkumar. The tiger was shifted to Gorewada after it was captured in December 2017 from Bhandara district,” said Pramod Panchbhai, divisional manager. Deputy director of WRTC Dr Vinod Dhoot said, “Our team had been watching the behaviour of the two while in captivity over the last few months. The bonding between the two tigers had grown in the recent past and in the last 10 days it was observed that Lee showed all signs of receptiveness. Both the animals were not ready to leave each other.” Both the tigers were released at 10am under the observation of Dr Vinod Dhoot and other experts including gynaecologist from MAFSU Dr Manoj Patil, WRTC’s Dr Mayur Pawshe, Dr Sujit Kolganth, Dr AS Shalini and Transit Treatment Centre’s (TTC) Dr Syed Bilal Ali. When asked about breeding in the open, Dr Upadhye said, “Being the first experiment, it will be interesting to know what will happen if the cubs are delivered in the open. Last time, the tigress delivered in captivity but killed all her cubs, may be due to inexperience.” FDCM officials said, “Post release, both tigers were compatible and mingled with each other and mated. If the cubs are reared properly, we can exchange them with other zoos in lieu of other animals.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/gorewada-zoo-begins-breeding-tigers-in-safari/articleshow/86049384.cms||Vijay Pinjarkar

After the case of gang rape was lodged by a Varanasi woman in October 2020, Vishnu, who is also booked in many other criminal cases, is absconding. The police had intensified efforts for his arrest as the complainant in this case had claimed in August that she was being threatened and a false case had also been lodged against her in Mumbai. SP Bhadohi RB Singh on Wednesday said, “After getting inputs about Vinshu, a joint team of STF and Gopiganj police raided the house of Tiwari in Anapur village. However, before the cops could enter the house, Vishnu managed to escape, leaving behind his 9mm pistol and cartridges. During checking of the house, police recovered one more pistol and a mobile phone.” Police arrested Tiwari and booked him under section 216 of IPC and section of Arms Act. During interrogation, Tiwari confessed that Vinshu had been taking shelter at his home. Vijay had come in the line of fire when Aurai cops booked him under Goonda Act on July 18, 2020 for issuing threat to a contractor, who got the contract of realising toll at Lalanagar toll plaza on national highway-2 in Aurai area. Later, on August 8, 2020 Mishra’s relative Krishna Kanth Tiwari lodged an FIR against him, his wife and MLC Ramlali Mishra and son Vishnu with Gopiganj police alleging that the trio forcibly got his property registered in their name. Vijay was arrested in a dramatic style in Madhya Pradesh on August 14, 2020 and since then he is in jail while Ramlali and Vishnu are absconding. On September 19, 2020 Tiwari’s son and prime witness in this case Surya lodged another FIR with Gopiganj police against Mishra’s daughter Sima Mishra, grandson Vikas Mishra, Girdhari Pathak and four others for threatening him. Two more cases were also lodged against Vijay on September 26, 2020 and October 12, 2020 for misusing the letter pads of gram pradhan for recommending CB-CID or other high-level probe in a case in which he was arrested and sent to jail on August 14 and threatening then Gyanpur Nagar Panchayat chairman Hiralal Maurya for extortion. On October 18, 2020 a 25-year-old woman of Varanasi gave a complaint to Bhadohi police alleging Vijay, his son and nephew were sexually harassing her since 2014. SP Bhadohi said, “Taking action on the complaint, Gopiganj police had lodged an FIR under sections 376D, 342 and 506 of IPC against Vijay, Vishnu and Vikas.” In August, the complainant in the gang rape case had released a video alleging that she was being threatened by Mishra,s and a fake case was also lodged to pressurize her. SP Bhadohi said that in view of her claims, details were sought and it came to light that a woman had lodged an FIR against her in Mumbai. “We sent a letter to Mumbai police for proper investigation into the case,” he added.

The arrested person has been identified as Adithyan Kannumpeth (27) of Ilayaavur, Kannur. The case pertains to the murder of Manasa, who was shot dead in Nellikuzhi, Kothamangalam, on July 29. She was shot by Rakhil P (32), a youth she met on Instagram, using a 7.62mm country-made gun at the rented house where she was staying. Rakhil took his own life with the gun after murdering Manasa. Kothamangalam police said that Adithyan was arrested after they found that he was involved in acquiring the gun from Bihar and bringing it to Kerala. He has been booked under the Arms Act and for conspiring to commit the offence, said an official. With this, the total number of persons arrested in the case became three. Earlier, two Bihar natives, Sonu Kumar (20), a resident of Parsando village in Munger district, and Maneesh Kumar (23) of Buxar district were arrested for allegedly supplying the country-made gun used for the crime. Police had found that the pistol was reportedly purchased for Rs 35,000 and that Rakhil was given training in using the firearm in Bihar. Adithyan was a close friend of Rakhil and he is suspected to have travelled to Bihar with the accused when he went there to purchase the gun. A team of four sleuths with the investigation team has left for Bihar along with Adithyan for further investigation. Police said that the investigation in Bihar is part of further investigation into the murder. “The team of officials would reach Bihar by Thursday. Further details about his involvement will be known once the evidence collection in Bihar is completed,” said the official. Initial investigations itself had confirmed that the murder was committed after meticulous planning. The shooter had taken a room on rent close to the house where the victim was staying and the college where she studied. He was waiting for an opportune moment and on the fateful day he barged into the house where the woman was staying and shot her.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/one-more-held-for-helping-rakhil-acquire-gun/articleshow/86049431.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Kanpur||KMC, Metro Rail Corporation sort out issue regarding construction of structure||Done/ALVI Times News Network Kanpur: Kanpur Municipal Corporation(KMC) and Metro Rail Corporation shook hands after a tug-of-war over its construction and demolition on Tuesday and decided to sit on every Tuesday for better coordination. However, KMC has placed a demand of Rs over 106 crore as compensation for using its land and destroying its structure. At a meeting, the two departments discussed the construction and demolition of a structure raised in between Jalkal workers’ quarters and the bungalow of an additional municipal commissioner in Benajhabar. Mayor Pramila Pandey stated that the permanent rooms raised by the Metro Corporation were without foundation and they could come down in a strong wind. Moreover, the construction was illegal as Metro was constructing them 15 feet outside of the boundary wall. Ajay Anand Verma, SDM UP Metro Rail Corporation admitted that there was some fault in raising the structure. The municipal commissioner thereafter complained that Metro did not share anything with the municipal corporation. “KMC did not have any knowledge about Metro Phase 1, 2 and 3 plans and there was no communication about it. Metro Rail Corporation should convene a coordination meeting at least once in a month”, the municipal commissioner said. The mayor thereafter raised the issue of compensation and said Lucknow Metro Rail Corporation had paid compensation to the Nagar Nigam land which had been acquired by the Rail Corporation, but in Kanpur it had not been paid to which Verma said that an officer would conduct a survey with the KMC officials to identify the land and provide compensation. He said in Lucknow, the compensation was given on the DM circle rates and it was given to those whose land had been used in the construction of the pillars. The mayor said that there was a proposal to construct underground at Brijendra Swaroop Park but now the Rail Corporation was raising pillars. “Metro will give compensation for pillars but the whole park has been destroyed”, she said. The municipal commissioner directed its officials to assess the damages of KMC property, Park, Smart City street lights, temporary use of land and prepare a detailed report. The KMC officials later presented a list of land acquired by the Metro Rail Corporation and claimed compensation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kanpur/kmc-metro-rail-corporation-sort-out-issue-regarding-construction-of-structure/articleshow/86047165.cms||---

As many as 85 of the total 226 posts in the hospital — including that of doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers — are yet to be filled. The civil hospital also offers services in the rural areas through a network of hospitals. With over 200 Covid beds, the civil hospital is one of the biggest dedicated Covid-19 hospitals in Nashik and a large number of critical patients have been treated at the facility. At present, 37% posts at the hospital are vacant, including key positions like gynaecologist, obstetrician, psychiatrist, eye surgeon, anaesthetist, among others, along with matrons, sisters and ward boys. Civil surgeon Dr Ashok Thorat said there is a shortage of healthcare workers not just at the civil hospital but also at other facilities located in rural Nashik. “The vacancies at the health department are affecting the services provided in the district. The issue has been raised with the state government, which is conducting the recruitment process,” said Dr Thorat. The requirement for doctors is higher than other employees at the hospital. There are 24 posts of doctors, including psychiatrists and pediatrics and these are more in demand considering the Covid-19 situation. In total, there are 11 vacancies for doctors at the civil hospital itself. The staff shortage is having a telling effect not only at the civil hospital at the district headquarters but even at sub-district and rural hospitals, located in the remote and rural areas. The lack of appropriate staff members defeats the purpose of creating health facilities in the remote area. For instance, establishments like the sub-district hospital at Yeola and Women and Child Hospital at Malegaon have been completely running on pooled staff as vacancies are yet to be filled. Asked if the lack of staff had been affecting patients, the civil surgeon said the administration has been ensuring that services provided to patients were least affected. “If and when the third wave of Covid-19 strikes, we will require large manpower to deal with the situation. The state government is carrying out massive recruitment for all posts, hence we are likely to get the staff soon,” Dr Thorat stated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/key-positions-still-vacant-at-nashik-civil-hospital/articleshow/86045180.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Pune||Pune: Autos barred from airport pick-ups, flyers struggle||PUNE: Flyers landing at the airport are finding it difficult to find transport as authorities are no longer allowing autorickshaws to enter the premises to pick up passengers. About a month ago, the airport authorities had removed the pre-paid autorickshaw booth from the arrival area.Now, the autorickshaws are parked along the New Airport Road, which runs parallel to the airport building, and near the parking lot number two. Pune airport director Santosh Dhoke said autorickshaws cannot pick up passengers from the airport any more but are allowed to drop flyers. “Pick-ups from the airport by autorickshaw is not in the guidelines but I have requested the headquarters to make some arrangement,” he said. Autorickshaw drivers do not have much clarity regarding matter. “We were told the vacate the premises just before Independence Day,” said an autorickshaw driver and member of the union which provides the pre-paid service. “Our licence to operate from the airport expired on August 30 and the authorities had assured us that it will be renewed. However, after a while, we were told that there was no provision for an autorickshaw stand at the airport,” he said. Passengers were now forced to walk to the autorickshaws near the parking lot number two or we ask them to wait near the gate till we bring our vehicles, he said. Another autorickshaw driver said that with pre-paid booth being removed from the premises, many flyers are being cheated by other drivers. “Our service has fixed rates for different places. Now, we have wait sit outside the airport and convince flyers that we are the pre-paid service,” he said. Sadhna Goswami, who flew from Pune airport recently, said she could see Ola and Uber booths but no autorickshaw stand. “I have to pay Rs 230 to go to Kondhwa from the airport in an autorickshaw but cab costs over Rs 320. For single passengers with less luggage, autorickshaws are the best option,” said Goswami. Nilesh Prabhakar (48), who landed at the Pune airport early this week, said he flies frequently from Delhi and usually takes an auto to Kondhwa. “Cabs are costly and there have been instances when my rides have been cancelled by the driver and I had to pay the charges,” said Prabhakar, adding that he had to walk 40-50 metres to the far end of a parking lot to take an autorickshaw. Recently, Pune MP Girish Bapat, who is also the chairman of the Pune airport advisory committee, wrote to civil aviation minister Jyotiraditya Scindia highlighting the matter.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/autos-barred-from-airport-pick-ups-flyers-struggle/articleshow/86051872.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Kolkata||Potholes turn Bridge No. 4 into death trap for motorists||Kolkata: Large craters have turned Bridge No. 4 near Park Circus into a death trap for bikers and motorists, including auto drivers. The number of accidents is going up with several craters having surfaced on the bridge in the past past fortnight due to the lack of a proper repair. Habib Alam, an auto driver and a resident of Sapgachi in Topsia, said that the local traffic guard has recorded around 10 accidents on the bridge in the past 12 days. “Going by the nature of the accidents, some of them could have been fatal. In most cases, bikers fell on the bridge after hitting a crater in the evening or at night as the bridge does not have proper illumination. In a couple of cases, autos had to be overturned to give space to larger vehicles during rush hours,” said Alam. Mahesh Ram, a resident of Park Circus, is scared of the condition of the bridge and the recurrence of accidents there. Locals took up the matter with Topsia police station and the local Kolkata Municipal Corporation’s borough office, requesting them for an immediate repair of the craters. “But all our requests have so far been fallen on the deaf ears of the civic body,” said Ram. According to a KMC roads department official, the Bridge No. 4 and all arterial roads connected to it had figured in the essential repair list. In fact, the Kolkata traffic police too has mentioned the name of Bridge No. 4 in its priority list that has already been submitted to the KMC along with 350 other stretches of roads across the city, which are crying for immediate repair. “Bridge No. 4 is on our priority list and the one submitted by the traffic wing of the Kolkata Police. At present, we have put all major repair drives on hold due to the rain. We are waiting for a prolonged dry spell so that we can take up the repair of all major roads simultaneously,” said the KMC roads department official. Mohammed Alam, a resident of Shamsul Huda Road, refused to buy the logic. “While accidents are happening at regular intervals on Bridge No. 4, the civic body is waiting for a dry spell. First, we need to save lives even by doing patchwork. Later, the KMC can take up thorough repair and wrap up the work before Puja,” Alam said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/potholes-turn-bridge-no-4-into-death-trap-for-motorists/articleshow/86049424.cms||Saikat Ray
---||Pune||DJs back behind consoles in Pune, expect party scene to revive by year-end||PUNE: Restaurants and bars in the city are bringing back their resident DJs to entertain patrons after Covid restrictions were eased and operation timings extended. Without any income for the most part of the past 18 months, the DJs are happy to get behind the console. Vikram Vaghani, also known as DJ Vaggy, said, “The bars and clubs are under financial pressure, but have managed to set aside a budget for DJs. Though it is 50% of what it used to be during the pre-Covid times, something is better than nothing.” With the current 10pm closing time, the DJs get an hour or so to actually perform because crowds start coming in after 9pm. “As a result, bar and club owners feel that the reduced fees for the DJs are justified. Before the pandemic, when the closing time was 12.30-1am, the DJs used to get a good 3-4 hours to perform. This would justify 100% of their fees,” he said. Yogesh Patil, popularly known as DJ Dustin, said, “If you feel that the deadline is early, the only way to deal with it is to start the party early too. Patrons are understanding and coming in earlier to enjoy the weekend gigs. Though we are uncertain about a third wave, venue and event managers are taking extra precautions.” He said, “Dance floors are out of bounds. The party scene is expected to pick up after Ganeshotsav. We hope that we won’t have to experience another New Year party, where we had to wrap up by 10pm like last year.” Abhinav Girdhar, aka DJ Faith, said, “Many DJs have been brought back to work on a commission basis where they earn a certain percentage of the total sales that they can bring in. Many people are also going bar hopping, distributing business among bars and clubs and increasing footfalls. The DJs are also getting outstation invitations from cities such as Kolkata, Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Indore where there are less restrictions and nightlife is almost back to the pre-Covid times.” A bar owner from Aundh, said, “We have been inviting DJs back for the last two-three weeks, and were getting by with readymade playlists before that. It has been our patrons’ demand to get the DJs back.” Another bar owner from Koregaon Park said, “Our resident DJ has a fan following and is taking the effort to engage with the community virtually and encourage them to come over, resulting in a boost in footfall and business.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/djs-back-behind-consoles-expect-party-scene-to-revive-by-year-end/articleshow/86051890.cms||Anjali Jhangiani
---||Delhi||Two new bodies to put environment clearances in Delhi on fast track||NEW DELHI: State Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA) and State Level Expert Appraisal Committee (SEAC) have been constituted for Delhi for a three-year term. Delhi environment minister Gopal Rai said it would be easier to handle applications with the constitution of SEAC. The Delhi government had sent its proposal for reconstitution of SEIAA/SEAC, along with names of experts, to the central government in 2020 and, after multiple correspondence and meetings, the notification was finally issued. According to the Environment Protection Rules, all category ‘A’ projects (mega projects) are approved by an expert appraisal committee of the MoEF & CC, while all category ‘B’ projects (large projects) are approved by SEIAA. “Category ‘B’ projects requiring environmental clearance will not have to wait for the central government’s approval and approval will now be given in a fast-tracked manner by the Delhi government itself. We will also make the system more robust and transparent,” said Rai. He added environment protection is a prime responsibility of the Kejriwal government and it will not compromise on standards. The authority will meet monthly, leading to faster decision making and lower pendency of cases. The authority can also mandate regular inspection of project sites which have been granted Environment Clearance (EC) to ensure that they are complying with all norms. If any project is found to be in violation, the authority can take appropriate decisions to ensure compliance with environmental norms, including revocation of EC if severe violations are found. Any citizen who finds any project site in violation of norms can also contact the authority to inform them of any violations or discuss any ideas. Sarvagya Kumar Srivastava has been appointed as the chairman of SEIAA and Reena Gupta as member. The Delhi government’s special secretary (environment) will be member secretary. SEAC will comprise a chairman, 11 members and a member secretary. Reena Gupta, SEIAA member, said, “We are happy that Delhi SEIAA has been reconstituted. Now, approval and monitoring decisions can be taken at the state level. We look forward to making the EIA process more robust and transparent.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/2-new-bodies-to-put-environment-clearances-in-delhi-on-fast-track/articleshow/86051896.cms||---
---||Aurangabad||Harsul dam overflows, many other M’wada irrigation projects full||Aurangabad: Heavy rainfall activity in Aurangabad has resulted in the overflowing of the Harsul dam, whereas many other irrigation projects located in Marathwada have also been filled to the brim by Wednesday. In total, five out of 11 major irrigation projects were releasing water by Wednesday morning. The five dams include Lower Dudhna dam in Parbhani, Sidhheshwar dam in Hingoli, Majalgaon dam in Beed district, Vishnupuri dam in Nanded district and Upper Penganga dam located in Yavatmal district. Barring Jayakwadi major irrigation project (48%) in Aurangabad district and Manjra major irrigation project (63%) located in Beed, four other such key projects were filled to more than two-third of the designed live storage capacity, as per the official data made available. Various major, medium and minor irrigation projects located in Marathwada were holding live storage of 127 TMC all together by Wednesday evening, as against the designed live storage of 260.3 TMC. While the cumulative storage during the corresponding period last year was 177 TMC, the relatively lower storage level in Jayakwadi dam this year has been attributed to greater storage during the previous rainy season. Jayakwadi dam, which was holding almost double the present storage the last year (98.4%), has not received inflows from upstream dams located in Nashik and Ahmednagar districts so far. Authorities representing the Water Resources Department (WRD) said the combined storage in different dams in Marathwada would cater to drinking water needs until the arrival of the next monsoon. “With almost half of the major dams overflowing by now, we do not foresee any hurdles in releasing water for agriculture and industries in many areas,” a senior WRD official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/harsul-dam-overflows-many-other-mwada-irrigation-projects-full/articleshow/86045413.cms||---

In her complaint to the senior officers, she said when she approached the IO to ask about the progress of the investigations, the officer accused her of not being ‘clean’ herself and refused to initiate the arrest of the accused. Senior officers have ordered a probe into the complaint. The woman, working in a pharmaceutical company, had filed an FIR against her senior colleague Gaurav Dwivedi on July 7, 2021, under the IPC sections of rape and assault at Kalyanpur police station of the city. It was alleged that the accused over some pretext had invited her to his place and raped her by offering her tea laced with sedatives and also filmed the act. Later, he had raped her on several occasions threatening her to make her video viral on social media. In May 2021, when the accused had threatened her and asked her to reach his place, his wife too arrived at the spot and caught him red-handed with her. After being exploited sexually repeatedly by Gaurav, the survivor then lodged a complaint at the Kalyanpur police station. Subsequently, the police filed a case against the accused under 376 and 352 of IPC. According to the survivor, she had also made a complaint to the company’s senior officials in this regard, but no action was taken against the accused, instead he was transferred to Ghaziabad three days after the case was registered. According to the woman, even after two months, no action has been taken in this matter and accused the IO of the case of partisan approach towards the investigation. “Whenever I approach investigating official Dharmendra Singh, he makes objectionable remarks saying that she is also not a ‘Sati-Savitri’, and that it was her consent too with whatever had happened with her,” stated the survivor in her complaint. She added in her complaint, “The reason of the investigator is that rape is not such a crime, due to which the accused should be imprisoned.” She also alleged that the IO is openly demanding bribe and humiliates her whenever she approaches him to know about the progress of the case. “Any kind of objectionable remarks on the victim invites punishment. A probe has been ordered and if evidence is found against the sub-inspector, strict action will be taken against him,” said SP West BBGTS Mutthy.

---||Mumbai||Mumbai: ED suspects ex-Sena MP’s role in co-operative bank fraud case||MUMBAI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) suspects that Shiv Sena's former MP Anandrao Adsul is a beneficiary of misappropriated funds of City Co-operative Bank and had searched six premises related to him last week in a money laundering case. The ED collected several documents during the search and likely to summon Adsul soon for his statement. The ED case is based on the Mumbai police FIR related to the City Co-operative Bank fraud, where Adsul is the complainant. He is chairman of the City Co-operative Bank. Relatives of Adsul stated that the ED started the investigation in the fraud case under political pressure to harass them. Adsul was one of the petitioners in the Bombay high court in the fake caste certificate issue of Amravati MP Navnit Kaur Rana. Rana had defeated Adsul in the 2019 parliamentary election from Amravati by around 37,000 votes. In June, the Bombay high court cancelled Rana's caste certificate. She challenged the order in the Supreme Court, which has stayed the high court order. Adsul’s son and one of the directors in the City Co-operative Bank, Abhijit, said, “We are the complainant in the case but are facing harassment due to political interference. The first time the ED summoned my father when Navnit Rana’s caste certificate case was scheduled in the high court on March 25. Again, they visited our place on September 2 (last Thursday), when the case hearing was scheduled in SC. ED officials are doing it under political pressure to divert our attention from the case.” In June 2020, the N M Joshi Marg police station in Mumbai had registered a fraud case against auditors, valuers and staffers of City Co-operative Bank on Adsul’s complaint. Afterwards, the case was transferred to the economic offences wing of Mumbai police. Based on the police case, the ED registered the money laundering case.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-ed-suspects-ex-sena-mps-role-in-co-op-bank-fraud-case/articleshow/86052511.cms||Vijay V Singh
---||Nagpur||‘RT-PCR -ve, but HRCT shows lungs affected. Could be Covid’||Nagpur: The slow but sure increase in number of new Covid patients in the district for the last three days has raised eyebrows of the doctors and new claims are now taking centre stage. Some doctors say patients show symptoms, but are testing negative in RT-PCR and yet CT scan of their lungs reveals alarmingly bad condition. “Suddenly, fever patients are growing all around us. Many people have started showing symptoms like fever, cough due to cold. Since there is dengue outbreak too, doctors are treating these patients for dengue-like illnesses. In addition to this, RT-PCR results are negative in many cases. But the high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan shows ground-glass opacity similar to what is seen in Covid,” said Dr Prashant Chakkarwar. “You should not forget that even in the last wave, the RT-PCR test was Covid negative in many people, but the HRCT scan showed ground-glass opacity,” he added. During the second wave, the HRCT was very commonly used diagnostic tool and many doctors recommended it to patients irrespective of their RT-PCR status. Now, very few patients are getting their CT scan done. Radiologists confirmed that HRCT demand has gone down significantly. “There are fewer takers for HRCT now. Earlier, we used to make people aware of the fact that repeated HRCT is bad for health, still many used to insist on CT scans. Now, neither doctors are recommending it, nor patients are that enthusiastic,” said director of a leading private radiodiagnosis centre in West Nagpur. A leading paediatrician also claimed that he has seen some children in ICUs with bad lungs, but their RT-PCR was negative. On September 5, TOI reported that doctors are testing Covid positive and alerts are being circulated in doctors’ groups to keep vigil, especially while examining patients in OPDs. On Tuesday, 10 medical students have tested Covid positive. One doctor is under treatment in AIIMS. All of them had taken both the doses of vaccine. This shows that breakthrough infections (Covid positive after both doses) are real.

The civic body has rejected the applications as the mandals did not follow the guidelines laid down by the NMC on various aspects like construction of pandals, no encroachment on road, among others. An NMC official said the mandals whose applications were rejected can re-apply only if they follow the guidelines. “Every year the municipal corporation lays down guidelines based on instructions of the Bombay High Court about the manner in which pandals should be erected so that people are not inconvenienced,” he said. “Since the mandals did not follow the guidelines, the NMC has rejected them permission to set up pandals,” Pradeep Chaudhary, NMC deputy commissioner (taxes), said. Various teams, comprising civic officials, visit venues where mandals plan to organise the festival and assess the situation based on which the permission is either granted. Meanwhile, the Nashik Mahanagar Ganeshotsav Mahamandal decided to stage a protest outside the NMC headquarters on Thursday Sameer Shete, president of the association, said they had demanded that NMC should charge Rs 100 per pandal. “Since the NMC is not responding we are going to hold the agitation,” he said||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nmc-rejects-applications-of-403-ganesh-mandals/articleshow/86045218.cms||---

The devotees and Ganesh mandals can retain such idols as is and repaint it next year with natural, eco-friendly colours. To observe the custom, devotees can just dip the idol three times in water and store it at home to repaint and reuse next year. Immersing betel nut can also mark the symbolic immersion of the idol,” team ‘Jeevitnadi’ said. For idols made using natural clay or mud, ‘Jeevitnadi’ has appealed for immersion in a bucket at home. “Clay can also pollute water by disintegrating and settling at the bottom. Anything in excess can harm the rivers and water bodies. After immersing in a bucket, the same water can be poured in the garden or in pots,” experts concerned said. Among other measures aimed at eco-friendly celebrations, Jeevitnadi has appealed for eco-friendly decoration using paper and cardboard and either composting of Nirmalya (floral offerings) or handing it over to civic squads. The city markets were abuzz as the 10-day Ganesh festival is scheduled to begin on Friday. The civic administration has appealed to citizens to avoid crowding and follow Covid-appropriate behaviour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/save-kham-river-ensure-eco-friendly-celebrations-appeals-resource-group/articleshow/86045211.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Their mother, who too was bitten by the cobra, is in a serious condition. The incident took place at the Sonesangavi village in Kaij taluka of the district post-Wednesday midnight when the family was sleeping on the floor. A cobra slithered into the room and bit the family members one after another within a span of a few minutes. Two sisters — Sweety (3) and Swapnali (4.5) — died, the police said. “The three-year-old girl woke up crying after the snake bit her. Not knowing that she had been bitten, her parents — Deepak and Jayashri Sakhare — asked her to go back to sleep. Later, the Jayashri felt something bite her, but she thought it was an ant or any other insect, and did not pay much attention. However, Deepak woke up when he felt something cold come in contact with his skin. That is when the family realised that there was a snake in the house,” Bandu Yadav, a policeman attached with Yusuf-Wadgaon police station, said. Police said Deepak immediately killed the snake and rushed to the hospital along with his wife and Sweety. “At that time, the family was not aware that Swapnali too had been bitten by the snake. They left her home, where she passed away in the early hours. Sweety died on the way to the hospital and the mother is currently on ventilator at the state-run hospital at Ambejogai,” Yadav said. Honorary wildlife warden of Aurangabad, Kishor Pathak said people should avoid sleeping on the ground, especially during the rainy season, in order to avoid nocturnal snake-bites.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/2-sisters-die-of-cobra-bite-mother-still-serious/articleshow/86045215.cms||---

The market areas were decorated beautifully as shopkeepers displayed their wares in interesting ways to attract customers. Miniature temples, thrones for Ganesh idols, colourful lights, crowns, flowers, jewellery for the idols, etc, have been put on display by shopkeepers. Even the rain couldn’t dampen the festival spirit. Sachin Tamboli, a shopkeeper at Paan lane, said, “The market has slowly gripped now after the first and second wave of the pandemic. Last year, we faced heavy losses due to Covid-19. Hopefully, we will make it up through our sales this year. People are stepping out to purchase goods and that is a good sign for the economy too.” Eco-friendly decoration seems to have become a trend this festive season. Aniket Yadav, who purchased a miniature temple at Papachi Tikti, said, “Due to Covid and floods, everyone has understood the importance of going eco-friendly. Hence, we will be decorating our throne made from plywood along with a miniature temple replica of Mahalaxmi Mandir made from cardboard. The price of all the products have increased by 10 to 15 percent. However, as it is the biggest festival that takes place only once a year, we will be welcoming Ganapati Bappa with great enthusiasm.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/people-throng-city-markets-decked-with-festive-goodies/articleshow/86045224.cms||Rahul Gayakwad

College representatives said the focus will be on practical sessions and after nearly 18 months of no offline classes, they will start readying the laboratories, machinery and equipment to ensure that they are ready for the reopening. Principal of Brihan Maharashtra College of Commerce, Seema Purohit, said they are ready to reopen colleges. “We have acquired all the infrastructure for precautionary measures. Even our academic timetable is set in a way that whether it is online or offline, we can follow the same in due course,” she said. The colleges are awaiting government nod to start the practical sessions as they have noticed that these sessions hampered the most during the virtual sessions. Head of the chemistry department at a city college, Randhir Mishra, said, “The chemistry lab at the college has almost become redundant with 18 months of no practicals for students. We are waiting for the government to give permission to at least begin offline practical sessions so that the students do not suffer. Before the reopening in November, we will have to run a check with all instruments and order new stock of chemical and other such material.” “A quick decision from the government to reopen is needed some days in advance so that the students are able to prepare their practical work in college. November is still away, but we are ready for the reopening,” said Asmita Jahav, principal of a science college .||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/stress-on-practicals-after-colleges-resume-in-nov/articleshow/86051910.cms||Swati Shinde Gole
---||Allahabad||STF arrests wanted liquor mafia in Lucknow||Prayagraj: With the arrest of liquor mafia Sudhakar Singh, the special task force (STF) of UP police in Lucknow is close to busting the huge network of liquor smugglers operating across the state in an organized manner. Sudhakar Singh is a resident of Purmai Sultanpur village of Patapgarh district. Wanted in connection with over 12 cases and carrying Rs 1 lakh cash reward on his head, Singh fell into the police net near Mahanagar area of Lucknow while he was planning to meet someone in the state capital on Tuesday afternoon. Singh, who got a job of a traffic assistant in Railways through sports quota in 2005, was currently posted at NER, Lucknow. Police said that the first FIR against Singh was lodged at Kunda police station in 2010 under Sections 307, 323, 325, 364, 395 and 427 of IPC, and 7 CLA. Other FIRs under various sections were registered against him in 2014, 2016, 2018 and 2021. The police of Pratapgarh, Sultanpur and Prayagraj were looking for him in connection with liquor smuggling and his parallel liquor factory in Pratapgarh. A senior STF official told TOI that the accused was a mastermind in setting up illegal liquor factory. He used to prepare adulterated liquor of various brands. This adulterated liquor looks like liquor bottles that are sold at IMFL shops. The accused also owns seven licences of government liquor shops. The official also added that Singh used to bring consignments from Haryana and Punjab, and later carried out adulteration of liquor in Pratapgarh district. The mafia was involved in liquor trade to earn fast bucks.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/stf-arrests-wanted-liquor-mafia-in-lucknow/articleshow/86047189.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Nazrul Mancha fountain water floods Lake premises||Kolkata: Vast stretches of Rabindra Sarobar were swamped on Wednesday with water flowing out of the fountain channels that are being concretized as part of the Nazrul Mancha renovation. Green activists have raised an alarm, apprehending the channels, linked to one of the water bodies inside Rabindra Sarobar and serving as rainwater drainage lines for more than three decades, would keep flooding the eco-sensitive zone and the walkways criss-crossing it whenever there is heavy downpour and the Lake is filled over the brim. The 2,400-seated Nazrul Mancha is currently being refurbished. The auditorium, frequently visited by chief minister Mamata Banerjee to attend various programmes, will now have 200 more seats and a new roof. Water bodies cover 73 acres of the 192-acre Rabindra Sarobar premises on Southern Avenue. The rest include Nazrul Mancha, an open-air-theatre that was converted into a closed auditorium and is currently undergoing a makeover, Rabindra Sarobar Stadium, a few clubs and a vast open space. Popularly called the Dhakuria Lake, it is said to be the lungs of south Kolkata. Hundreds of people — many of them are elderly — take a stroll on the artificial lake premises in the morning and evening. On Wednesday, morning walkers had to face problems due to the sudden waterlogging. While some of them returned home to avoid the slush and the muddy ambience, those like environmentalist S M Ghosh and green activist-cum-Lake regular Sumita Banerjee decided to explore and check the source of the water. “The flooded pathways took us by surprise and we decided to find out where the water was coming from. That’s when we realized the water was flowing from Paddapukur as the channels linked to the fountains near Nazrul Mancha were being covered with concrete as part of the renovation,” said Ghosh. A morning walker of many years explained, “The channels connected to Paddapukur, one of the water bodies inside Rabindra Sarobar. The water of the fountains was actually recycled from Paddapukur. But they also act as the rainwater drainage outlets, especially during the monsoon, when the water body is overflowing.” Banerjee said, “We met the engineers immediately and alerted them about the potential damage due to such unplanned covering of the drainage channels. We made them pump out some of the water into one of the water bodies to avoid ruining the grounds of Rabindra Sarobar.” Ghosh said, “We have suggested that the water from the channel be diverted to various directions, to other fountains, or for watering plants and other uses.” An engineer of KMDA, the custodian of Rabindra Sarobar, said, “We are looking into the suggestions made by the morning walkers and green activists.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/nazrul-mancha-fountain-water-floods-lake-premises/articleshow/86049524.cms||Ajanta Chakraborty
---||Kolhapur||Shetti plans ‘missed call’ drive for sugar cane farmers||Kolhapur: Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana, the farmers’ outfit from Kolhapur, is going to launch a “missed call” campaign to register support of the state’s sugar cane farmers against the idea of instalment payment for the produce — as mooted by the Centre. Raju Shetti, the president of the outfit criticised both the Centre and the state government for favouring the idea of payment to farmers in instalments. Every year, the farmers demand fair and remunerative price (FRP) for sugar cane in one go. If the farmers get the money in one go, they can clear bank dues and start preparations for next season. Recently, the NITI Ayog suggested that the central government schedule the payment in three installments — first of 60% amount after 14 days; second of 20% after two weeks; and third of 20% after a month. Shetti said he was shocked to learn that the state government too has suggested payments in instalments. “The farmers will be at a loss if they get the payments in instalments. Today, most of the mills are getting privatised and the idea has, therefore, been mooted to favour them. We are going to activate a mobile number to which the farmers can give a miss call if they oppose the idea. We will take the data — on the number of farmers who oppose the idea — to the central government and will ask it not to proceed with it.” Shetti also attacked the Centre for the tall claims made over the FRP hike for the upcoming crushing season. Recently, the Centre had hiked the FRP and claimed that the price currently stands at around 87% above the actual cost of production. The FRP is fixed at Rs 2,900, and the cost of production for each tonne of sugar cane is estimated to be Rs 1,555. “I dare anyone from the Centre to grow one tonne sugar cane in just Rs 1,555. Considering the hike in the diesel prices and the cost of labour, the farmers have to spend Rs 850 to just cut and transport one tonne produce. The commission for fixing the agriculture price should have remained independent, instead of it suggesting measures suitable for the government,” said Shetti.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/shetti-plans-missed-call-drive-for-sugar-cane-farmers/articleshow/86045219.cms||---
---||Kochi||Kerala: Family of auto driver who died gets highest compensation of Rs 25 lakh||KOCHI: Family of an autorickshaw driver, who died in an accident caused by a stray dog, will get the highest amount of compensation given to any claimant in the stray dog issue. Justice Siri Jagan Committee, constituted to fix the compensation in stray dog menace, fixed Rs 25,20,000 as compensation to Biju’s family hailing from Thiruvankulam in Tripunithura municipality limits. The tragedy struck Biju’s family on April 4, 2019. Memories of that fateful day are still fresh in the mind of his wife Soorya. “Stray dog menace was severe at that time due to waste dumping. My husband was driving the autorickshaw when a stray dog ran across the road. He swerved the vehicle to avoid hitting the dog. But the vehicle toppled and my husband sustained grievous injuries. He died before reaching the hospital,” said Soorya. She said the family approached the committee after one of the acquaintances told them about the compensation to victims of stray dog menace. Biju was aged 41years at the time of the accident. Other claimants in the incident are Biju’s parents Kamala and Pavithran and the couple’s daughter Shivani. Tripunithura municipality has to pay the amount with interest. Currently, Soorya works as a senior associate in a company in Infopark. The previous highest compensation amount given by the committee was Rs 18 lakh to a Mala native. Sources said the committee receives many requests seeking compensation in accidents caused by stray dogs running across the road and vehicles toppling while trying to avoid hitting the dogs. The committee also receives requests for compensation from people bitten by pet dogs. The committee discards such requests. In some cases local bodies refuse to disburse the amount despite government order, forcing the claimant to knock on various doors to get the amount. Committee sources said the claimant should approach the state government if local bodies fail to disburse the amount. “The latest such incident is in Kulanada panchayat in Pathanamthitta, which refused to disburse Rs 30,000 compensation to a claimant,” said the source.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/family-of-auto-driver-who-died-gets-highest-compensation-of-rs-25l/articleshow/86049481.cms||T C Sreemol
---||Agra||Yogi sends 2nd team to Firozabad, to identify dengue variant that’s killed 96||Agra: The UP government sent a second team of health experts to Firozabad within a week, which will identify the dengue variant causing the outbreak which appears to be more dangerous for children. As of Wednesday, 78 of the 96 who died of the disease in Firozabad were kids. The National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) had earlier confirmed that the viral disease cases were primarily dengue, along with a few cases of malaria, scrub typhus and leptospirosis. Besides, a state team to study the outbreak had also visited the district, which has reported a majority of the cases. On Wednesday, a three-member team from Lucknow’s King George Medical College, led by senior pediatrician Dr SN Singh, started investigating the cases. The team will also guide local doctors on how to control spread of the disease and plan treatment protocols. “There are four serotypes of dengue viruses, designated as DENV-1, 2, 3 and 4. All are transmitted human-to-human through the bite of some species of Aedes mosquitoes,” said additional director of the state health department, AK Singh. “DENV-3 infections cause dengue haemorrhagic fever which is a severe and fatal form of the disease and causes a sudden drop in platelet count and bleeding in the gums. Dengue shock syndrome is the most severe form of dengue haemorrhagic fever.” The World Health Organisation had earlier alerted the district administration that the outbreak might be one of dengue haemorrhagic fever. “There are 64 camps in the district where 4,500 people, including those with fever, are undergoing treatment,” Firozabad CMO Dinesh Kumar Premi said. Sources told TOI that at least an estimated 5,000 people in the district are bedridden with fever. Health department officials have confirmed 220 cases of dengue in the district so far. Diarrhoea is emerging as a major symptom, with about 40% of the patients reporting it at government centres. The administration, meanwhile, is racing against time to make space for patients. A 100-bed facility set up at the Government Medical College, Firozabad ran out of space within 24 hours. The pre-existing 100-bed facility there is already holding four times its capacity, with beds lined up along corridors and stacked in storerooms. Health department records show 548 patients are being treated at the hospital, of whom 498 are children. “My five-year-old boy died waiting for treatment this morning,” said Ravi Rathore, a daily wager. “He developed a mild fever on Tuesday morning. He got worse by evening and started throwing up. We got him to the medical college on Wednesday morning, but there was no bed. No one attended to him and he died.” Chief medical superintendent of the hospital, Dr Hansraj Singh, said they are setting up 100 more beds. UP DG (health) Dr Ved Vrat Singh said medical resources are being diverted to Firozabad. “Senior officials are camping there for round-the-clock surveillance. Ambulances are being sent. Hospitals have been asked to use isolation beds and oxygen facilities reserved for Covid patients to treat those diagnosed with viral diseases."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/yogi-sends-2nd-team-to-firozabad-to-identify-dengue-variant-thats-killed-96/articleshow/86045235.cms||Deepak Lavania

Aurobindo Setu, an important elevated link in north Kolkata, is losing out on its load taking capacity and its bearings need to be replaced. The bridge requires regular maintenance, including the filling of potholes in its carriageway, lowering of the height bars and removal of plants. The 4.4km long Garden Reach flyover that was inaugurated in March, 2018 also needs to be repaired. The agency to be involved will look after the flyover’s yearly maintenance, including repairing of potholes and uprooting of plants.

South Delhi Municipal Corporation is now setting up replicas of Char Dham in place of the Golden Temple replica that was dismantled in June after objection by Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC). An official overseeing the project said that replicas of the Char Dham—Badrinath, Dwarka, Puri and Rameswaram—had been prepared and they were being erected in the park. A ‘vat vriksha’ has also also been prepared from the parts salvaged from the Golden Temple replica and it has been placed on the same site base, the official stated. “The Char Dham replicas have been placed near the Meenakshi temple replica. Each enclosure of these replicas will be spread over a 100 sqm area. The height of the replicas is around 20-25 ft. Final touches to monument replicas, greening work and other amenities will be provided in the next 15-20 days. The deadline to complete the project is September 20. The park will be ready for inauguration either by September-end or the beginning of October,” the official said. The theme of the park is ‘Unity in Diversity’ displayed through iconic monuments of the country, such as Charminar, Gateway of India, Konark Temple, Nalanda ruins, Mysore Palace, Meenakshi Temple, Hawa Mahal, Hampi ruins, Victoria Memorial, Sanchi Stupa, Gol Gumbaz, Ajanta Ellora Caves and Junagarh Fort. The park, which will host replicas from 14 states, was expected to be completed by March-April 2021, but the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic, monsoon and the controversy over the Golden Temple replica delayed the construction work. The park is spread over an area of six acres and its initial estimated cost was around Rs 18-20 crore. After Waste to Wonder Park at Sarai Kale Khan, Bharat Darshan Park will be the second such park featuring replicas of monuments prepared from junk material.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/bharat-darshan-park-near-punjabi-bagh-to-be-ready-by-month-end/articleshow/86051936.cms||Paras Singh

Each team will have an officer in-charge of the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) and four other members. The teams have been appointed as per the directions of the Bombay high court, which has set the guidelines for mandals to set up the pandals. The guidelines specify the size of the pandals so that they do not obstruct the pedestrians, transport and emergency vehicles. Though the permissions to set up pandals are given based on the design or maps submitted by the mandals, the dimensions are not followed actually on ground. The large sized pandals are seen in the old city areas of Rajarampuri and Kasba Bawda, where the roads are also narrow and crowded. Many times, these structures cause obstructions to the emergency vehicles. KMC’s deputy city engineer Harshit Ghatge said, “Each team is led by officer of Karvir sub-divisional office. It also has one police officer from the respective police station. There are more than 400 mandals which regularly takes permissions. However there are many which do not.” Ghatge said that they will file a criminal complaint against the mandal if the team finds the pandal of excess size and causing obstructions. There is no provision to issue show-cause notice and wait for the reply, he said. The teams will randomly visit mandals from Thursday. They are expected to complete the task in two to three days. To check violation of sound pollution rules, the team will be active till the end of the ten-day festival. The mandals have been advised not to use sound amplifiers, big capacity stereos for songs played at the pandals.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/teams-to-keep-a-check-on-pandal-size-noise-level/articleshow/86045262.cms||---

He, along with two IPS officers and several other officials, was suspended for his alleged nexus with sand mafias. Authoritative sources said the raiding teams seized documents related to purchase of several plots of land at his native village Navanagar in Buxar district and investments in real estate in his name and that of his wife at several other places. EOU’s additional director general (ADG) Nayyar Hasnain Khan said the searches were conducted on three locations of the suspended Bhojpur MVI after a disproportionate assets (DA) case was lodged at the EOU police station and search warrants obtained from the competent court on Tuesday. Vinod has been booked under Section 13(2) read with 13(1)(b) of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and amended in 2018. However, the searches started on Wednesday morning at the three locations in Patna, Buxar and Bhojpur under the leadership of DSP-rank officers, Khan said. “The documents related to investments will be analysed by the officials once the search operation is completed,” the ADG added. Vinod is the fourth officer against whom a DA case has been lodged by the EOU. Earlier, raids were conducted on the premises of two DSPs and a sub-divisional officer for their links with sand mafias and amassing unaccounted property. In Patna, the EOU team conducted a raid on flat no. 204 of Shanti Enclave at Dhanaut under Rupaspur police station area and recovered documents related to investments. According to the EOU officials, the suspended MVI’s residence at Motijheel (Anand Nagar) in Ara, the district headquarters of Bhojpur, was also searched. Vinod’s family was residing at the Motijheel residence during his posting there. But, later, he shifted his family to Shanti Enclave flat in Patna. Incidentally, Vinod was caught by the vigilance investigation bureau on the charges of accepting Rs44,000 as bribe in 2016. A case under Prevention of Corruption Act was also registered against him and his driver Satya Prakash at the vigilance police station in Patna in that connection. Though the vigilance bureau submitted the chargesheet against them in March 2018, the officer got plum posting. The sources said Vinod’s suspension was revoked by the department before his posting at Ara. Earlier, DA cases were lodged against DSPs Pankaj Kumar Rawat and Tanveer Ahmad, who were posted at Ara in Bhojpur and Paliganj in Patna district, respectively, before their suspension for alleged links with sand mafias. Sand mining in river Sone remains banned for three months during the monsoon period till October. The then sub-divisional officer of Dehri-on-Sone, Sunil Kumar Singh, also had to face the heat for similar charges. The state government had suspended the SPs of Bhojpur and Aurangabad after internal inquiry hinted at their links with sand mafias operating under their respective jurisdictions. Besides, action was also initiated against DSPs Sanjay Kumar (Dehri-on-Sone) and Anup Kumar (Aurangabad). In all, 41 officials, including inspectors and sub-inspectors posted in Patna, Bhojpur, Rohtas and Aurangabad districts, have been booked by the EOU for having their connections with sand mafias. The nexus caused a huge loss to the state exchequer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/eou-raids-premises-of-suspended-mvi-in-3-districts/articleshow/86049561.cms||Ramashankar

One of the day scholar too has tested positive. The infected students are admitted at Shalinitai Meghe Hospital and Research Centre (SMHRC) adjoining the DMMC campus. The dean said RTPCR test of the students would be done again on the fifth day as sometimes the infection shows up after a while. Meanwhile, the district reported just 6 new cases, including two each from city, rural and outside the district. Over 3,000 samples were processed by the labs. The number of tests have dropped significantly. Officials said the testing numbers were low probably due to Pola festival. Yet, all the close contacts of those testing positive are being tested, they said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/infected-students-fine-college-collecting-samples-of-others/articleshow/86049487.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Nashik||Nashik PC: Helmets must for bikers & pillion riders||Nashik: Commissioner of police Deepak Pandey said wearing helmets will be compulsory for both the two-wheeler riders and the pillion riders. Anybody not wearing the headgear would have to undergo two hours of counselling on traffic norms. “Helmet is compulsory for those riding two-wheelers. The pillion rider also has to wear the helmet as the person’s life is equally important. Our flying squads will keep a check for any such person not wearing a helmet. They will be asked to undergo counselling at Nashik First Traffic Park,” said Pandey. The city traffic police will deploy four teams, which will move across the city to look for the motorists who are not wearing helmets. The police will also set up check points across the city. “We first introduced the ‘No helmet, No Petrol’ drive, but since the number of people not adhering to norms is still high, the new drive is being taken up,” said assistant commissioner of police (traffic), Sitaram Gaikwad. He said the aim of the campaign was not to punish or penalise the riders but to educate them about their safety. “We are not focusing on anything like licences, documents or insurance of the motorists. Only those not wearing helmets will be on our radars,” said the officer. The two-wheeler riders not wearing helmets will be stopped and their vehicles will be seized. They will be taken to the counselling centre in the police vehicle where they will have to attend the two-hour session. They will also be given a certificate for their attendance and on presenting it, the rider will get their vehicles back. The officer said at a time, the seating capacity at the counselling centre was 40 and the sessions will begin from Thursday at 11 am and 3 pm. “All the Covid appropriate behaviour would be followed,” said Gaikwad.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-pc-helmets-must-for-bikers-pillion-riders/articleshow/86045286.cms||Abhilash Botekar

The civic administration focussed on carrying out rescue work in these low-lying areas. A few two-wheelers were also damaged in the heavy rain on Tuesday night. Aurangabad deputy divisional commissioner Parag Soman said the district administrations of eight districts of Marathwada reached out to people in the vulnerable areas in order to minimize loss of life and propertt. On Tuesday, Godavari river that passes through Nanded and other areas, was flowing at 350 metre within the municipal limits of Nanded-Waghala, just a metre short of the alert level. The danger level is 354 metre. The authorities said that the bodies of Bhagwan Rathod (65), cousin brother of Mukhed MLA Tushar Rathod, and his son Sandeep Rathod (38) were found on Wednesday. The bodies were found near a farm situated on the bank of a nullah after the floodwater receded by Wednesday morning. The car in which the duo was travelling was washed away on Tuesday afternoon. While the driver of the vehicle could come out and climb a tree, Bhagwan and his son were swept away. The rain havoc has caused at least two dams each in Kannad taluka of Aurangabad district and Ahmedpur taluka of Latur district, and one dam in Mukhed taluka of Nanded district to develop breaches, besides damaging 23 houses in different areas, including 15 in Hingoli district alone. While the road connectivity was snapped in some areas, especially those in the rural areas, due to submerged bridges, it was restored at majority of places by Wednesday evening. Soman said, “We were able to rescue and evacuate a large number of flood-affected people, avoiding further tragedies. There was no fresh major rainfall activity in many parts of the region till Wednesday evening. As per the standing instructions, the process of assessment of damage to crops has been initiated.” As per the reports, fields covering hundreds of acres in the agricultural areas across the Marathwada region have been submerged due to rainwater at many places. Official orders have been issued to assess the damage to kharif crops and orchards. Prior to the latest spell of rainfall, crops in over 2.2 lakh hectare across eight districts of Marathwada had already taken a blow this monsoon season, official data shows.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/aurangabad/120mm-rain-inundates-low-lying-areas-in-aurangabad-city/articleshow/86045273.cms||---

The order has been issued based on the 27th, 28th, 29th and 30th reports of the Justice Siri Jagan Committee. The three-member committee was constituted by the Supreme Court in April 2016 to consider claims for compensation to victims of stray dog menace in the state. The compensation should be given by the local bodies with nine per cent interest per annum from the date of claim till the payment. Of the 130 claimants, 28 are from Alappuzha and the rest from Ernakulam. Four members in a family hailing from Tripunithura municipality will get Rs 25 lakh, the highest amount fixed by the committee. A Kizhakkambalam native will get Rs seven lakh. As many as 24 claimants from Kochi corporation limit will get compensation. Sources said most of the claimants, who got compensation based on the recent four reports, are from Ernakulam and nearby areas as those in other districts couldn’t reach Kochi for the hearing due to the pandemic situation. The committee also find it difficult to hold hearings in other districts. Earlier, the committee used to hold around 30 hearings per sitting. “The government itself admits that more than one lakh dog bite incidents are reported in the state every year. But the committee received only around 3,000 to 4,000 applications for claims so far. This may be due to the lack of awareness regarding the compensation amount given to stray dog-bite victims,” said a source. If one is bitten by a stray dog or involved in an accident caused by stray dog, he or she or parent, in case the victim is a minor, can approach the committee based in Kochi. A letter explaining the incident, injury sustained, treatment expenses and travel expenses must be sent to the committee along with copies of relevant documents. The panel will hear both panchayat authorities and the claimant. The amount is fixed after evaluating the nature of injury, treatment expenses, loss of income and time taken to heal the wound.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/govt-awards-rs-77l-to-130-claimants-as-damages/articleshow/86049584.cms||T C Sreemol
---||Mysuru||Rural people switchback to firewood over high LPG price||Mandya: The rising price of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) is forcing the poor and middle class families in rural areas to switch to traditional firewood cooking, which is detrimental to their health. Many families in villages have started using firewood again and have stopped buying LPG cylinder that now cost over Rs 900. Barely a few years ago, only some families were using LPG to cook in rural areas. However, within a few years almost the entire rural populace embraced LPG cylinders thanks to increased number of gas agencies in rural areas. However, the increased LPG prices has meant that villagers have started collecting and storing firewood. “We have stopped using LPG as we could not afford it. When firewood is costless fuel for us, why should we buy LPG cylinders?” said Manchanna, a farmer in Keregodu village. Kalamma, a homemaker in Molekoppalu village said that her family almost stopped using gas cylinders after the price of cylinders went above Rs 800. “Earlier, we were completely dependent on gas cylinders for cooking. But now almost all families in my village are slowly abandoning LPG and switching back to firewood,” she said. Hulkere Mahadevu, a progressive thinker said all efforts of the previous governments to insulate women from the hazards of smoke from burning firewood appears to have been wasted as rural women are being forced to use firewood again due to the steep rise in prices of gas cylinders. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi must be ashamed to introduce Pradhan Mantri Ujjwal Scheme (PMUY) as now poor women are being forcibly discouraged from using LPG due to the high price,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/rural-people-switchback-to-firewood-over-high-lpg-price/articleshow/86047234.cms||---

Figures revealed that over 2.43 lakh recipients of all age groups were given jabs within a week (from August 31 to September 7) and if a similar pace of vaccination is maintained, the department would have administered 23 lakh jabs by September 15. The district health authorities have set a target to administer jabs to 46.10 lakh beneficiaries and till September 7, it has already crossed the 20.34 lakh mark. Interestingly, jabs were administered to 5,81,207 recipients in August month alone. "The number of recipients who got vaccinated till June 1 was 5,81,234 which rose to 8,84,249 on June 30,” said a senior health official. "Till July 1, a total of 8,52,932 people were vaccinated and by July 30, a total of 11,95,224 people were administered doses in the city," the official said. The figures claimed that over 3.03 lakh and 3.42 lakh people were given jabs in June and July month respectively. District immunization officer (DIO) and additional chief medical officer (ACMO) Dr Teerath Lal told TOI that sincere efforts to cover recipients of all age groups living in villages, blocks and urban areas were made. He also said that special camps were held at different sites in the city to cover the maximum number of people. He further added that three special camps including two in the last months (August 5 and 27) and one in this month ( September 6) had helped the department to cover over 2.33 lakh eligible recipients for vaccination as the response was way better than expected. The department has been increasing the number of covid vaccination sites (CVC) with every passing month and there are over 400 vaccination sites at present, compared to 200 in June. These measures were taken to expand the reach of the health teams, particularly in the remote villages to administer jabs to eligible recipients. Till September 7, as many as 20,34,680 recipients of all age groups were given jabs which included 16,15,817 of the first dose and 4,18,863 of the second dose. Roughly 44 per cent of the targeted recipients were given jabs and over 9 per cent are fully vaccinated now. Moreover, officials of the health department are still taking up cluster vaccination at the community health centre level to cover more people in the rural parts. Currently, on average, 30,000 to 35,000 recipients are being covered every day.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/allahabad/health-deptt-likely-to-cover-half-the-target-recipients-by-sept-15/articleshow/86047217.cms||Kapil Dixit

As many as 706 employees were relieved by the ZP on August 1 on the instructions of the state government as the Centre had stopped financial support for payment of their salaries under the NHM. After these contractual employees were relieved from the services, swab collection in the rural areas dropped significantly. The swab collection of around 7,000 a day has dropped to 4,000 a day. “These employees who were recruited exclusively for treating covid patients through the NHM have been relieved. The regular staff facing is problems in providing services to some extent. We are sure the government will find a way out soon,” said Rahul Hadpe of District Health Mission. It may be noted that district guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal pointed out that the staff should be hired immediately but the things have not changed. District collector Suraj Madhare said that the administration was trying to figure out the way to foot the salary bill of around Rs 1.5 crore for all the employees through the district planning committee and the state disaster response fund. “We have written to the state government seeking directions on the issue. We are hopeful that a solution will work out before the third wave of Covid hits us,” said Mandhare. The staff has also been trained in handling various equipment, including ventilators and oxygen apparatus besides other technical things. “They are an asset to us. These people have been trained to handle emergencies, ventilators and oxygen systems, along with pediatric care,” another officer said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/nashik-zp-health-staff-under-stress-as-nhm-issue-continues/articleshow/86045279.cms||Abhilash Botekar
---||Nagpur||No need for Covid curbs as of now: Fadnavis||Nagpur: Criticizing guardian minister Nitin Raut for his comments about reimposing Covid restrictions citing rising cases, leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis said there is no need for curbs as of now, and the BJP will oppose any such move. “Curbs should be based on the number of cases and bed occupancy percentage at any place. Weekend restrictions hardly serve any purpose. At this stage, it is not proper to impose restrictions when the number of cases is minimal,” he told TOI during his visit to the city. Stressing that the economy was slowly recovering from the pandemic shock, the former chief minister said people have just started earning some money and new curbs would spell doom for them. “All such major decisions should be backed by scientific data,” he said. On Raut being contradicted by state relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar over reimposing curbs, Fadnavis said it shows lack of coordination among the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) ministers, though they belong to the same party. “We have been witnessing lack of coordination among the MVA constituents ever since it came to power,” he said. On Monday, Raut had declared that Covid-19 third wave has reached the city and administration under him would reimpose restrictions within two-three days ahead of the festive season. He had indicated that timings of shops and other establishments would be curtailed to 4pm, and that of hotels and restaurants till 8pm. His statement had created panic among the citizens, particularly business community, which is looking up to festive sales after a long gap. Raut’s party colleague Wadettiwar had allayed the fears next day clarifying that no such discussion had taken place in the cabinet, nor chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had given instructions in this regard. Moreover, the restrictions would be imposed across Maharashtra simultaneously in consultation with the Covid task force, he had said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/no-need-for-covid-curbs-as-of-now-fadnavis/articleshow/86049578.cms||Vaibhav Ganjapure

These students are among 2,000 students from institutes across the globe, who have been given Millennium Fellowship by the United Nations Academic Impact, which has adopted Sex Education for All (Sefa) as its goal this time. The training to the NUJS students will be given by global experts who will be taking online classes from different parts of the world for an entire semester. These 20 UN fellows will have to select schools where they will take students under their wings and introduce them to the impacts of hormonal and emotional changes that adolescents go through. They will also be trained about consent, which is one of the key elements of Sefa. They will also be introduced to legal requisites that a child of that age should be aware of and the concept of sexual harassment through the cyberspace. “The syllabus has been designed in such a way that the Millennium Fellows can introduce children to safe internet use. It is from the internet that they often get trapped by prowlers. Children will be told about the legal tools that they should keep handy if they find themselves being stalked or being dragged into any rhetoric that has explicit sexual details,” said vice chancellor of NUJS, Nirmal Kanti Chakraborty, experessing his happiness that his students have made it to the final selection.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/un-chooses-20-nujs-students-to-give-sex-education-in-schools/articleshow/86049589.cms||Jhimli Mukherjee Pandey

Ministers Jayant Patil and Sunil Kedar held a meeting with Advocate-General (AG) Ashutosh Kumbhkoni a few days ago. Nationalist Congress Party MLC Shashikant Shinde was also present at the meeting. Speaking to TOI, Shinde said, “After the Karnataka HC’s decision, our hopes have increased. We have decided to approach the Bombay HC, which had stayed the bullock cart race in Maharashtra. We too had passed a law in the state legislature to allow the race with certain restrictions so that cruelty towards the animals is avoided. On the basis of the same restrictions, Karnataka HC has granted permission to the local government. We will refer to that verdict in our petition. We have decided to meet legal experts after 10 days before filling the review petition.” According to the experts, bullock cart races can be held if the conditions laid down by the Supreme Court in the Jalikattu case are followed. As per the guidelines specified, the cartman should not injure the bullocks in any manner. The organisers of the bullock cart races must ensure the presence of veterinary doctors on site. Further, the guidelines state that the videography of the entire race must be ensured. The organisers must also provide details of the race to the local administration 10 days prior to the event. The local administration should convey the details to the high court committee monitoring animal welfare issues. “At first, we demanded that the cart owners must be allowed to train their bullocks. The ‘khillar’ species of the bullock is becoming a rare breed. They need to be engaged in physical activities regularly in order to keep them healthy,” said Shinde.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/state-may-file-review-petition-to-resume-bullock-cart-races/articleshow/86045307.cms||---

The MC and Glada claim to have tried to pick spots that have direct access for public and which received a large number of daily commuters. To name a few, the civic body has proposed the Rose Garden parking, MC’s multi-level parking, Hambran Road fire station, and MC’s Gill Road zonal office. A committee was framed for this purpose and its members told to submit a report. The use of electric vehicles has increased and, being battery-operated, those e-bikes, e-rickshaws, and e-cars being introduced require charging stations. Electric vehicles are being encourages for a smoke-free environment in the city, since these have zero emissions. Confirming the hunt for charging-station points, additional commissioner Aaditya Dacchalwal said: "The principal secretary of the transport department had asked us to locate the sites where charging stations can be set up, and we came out with 10 spot, while Glada identified another 20 in its jurisdiction. Now their feasibility will be checked." Transport dept babyThis project is conceived by the state transport department and it will now sign a memorandum of understanding with a private company that has installed 200-odd charging stations for electric vehicles in Delhi. This company will come to the city next week. There are claims that one electric vehicle can be charged in 10 minutes but the count of charging points at one station is yet to be finalised, along with the cost of charging. MC’s e-vehicle planThe MC plans to replace the old bicycle carts of its door-to-door garbage collectors with e-rickshaws. The officials claimed that the pedal-pushed carts were outdated and not designed for holding segregated garbage bins, so e-rickshaws will be a good change. The feasibility of operating e-buses will also be checked.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ludhiana/30-e-vehicle-charging-station-sites-marked-to-be-finalised/articleshow/86047282.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Respect woman’s wish not to pursue harass case: Calcutta HC||KOLKATA: The Calcutta high court on Tuesday said if a woman refuses to press sexual harassment charges, and gives it in writing to probe committees, her desire should be respected. The HC said, it is time the society started “taking women seriously and treat them with dignity, not out of fear of the law but out of respect”. In a judgement on the August 2020 sexual harassment case against a Burdwan University professor, Justice Amrita Sinha said: The student “prefers a quiet burial to the entire incident. There is no reason why the desire and intention of the lady student will not be taken into consideration... .” In this case, the sexual harassment allegations were levelled by third parties which included the students’ union, a political party’s student wing, and the head of the department in which the professor worked. The complainants had provided a 2018 audio clip which reportedly contained conversations of the accused and the victim. The HC noted that this clip was never authenticated by agencies. The university then referred the case to the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC). When the ICC tried to reach out to the student, she said she wouldn’t press charges and even gave it in writing that neither she, nor her parents, were willing to proceed with the matter. Given this, the ICC could not proceed with the case but recommended that the university could take appropriate action. The ICC recommendations formed the basis of the university’s departmental proceedings against the professor and he was barred from all academic activities. The professor then moved the HC. The HC said, “After lapse of about two years the incident surfaced, that too, at the behest of some organization/ students’ union. Neither the students’ union nor any of its members have obtained consent from the concerned student prior to proceeding with the matter. The complainants do not have any personal knowledge of the alleged incident. It appears that, for reasons best known to them, the union became extra vigilant and re-opened the case, when practically the alleged incident died a natural death. The same has caused disrepute to not only the petitioner but also to the university and the student concerned.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/respect-womans-wish-not-to-pursue-harass-case-hc/articleshow/86049639.cms||Subrata Chattoraj

At IGGMCH and GMCH, several postgraduate students too are hit by the vector-borne disease and in urgent need of platelets. However, resident doctors told TOI that some have to wait for a day to arrange the platelet bags at IGGMCH. Dr Pradeep Butele, head of blood bank at IGGMCH, said the requirement is of five to ten bags a day and they are extracting the platelets on SOS basis. “In other times, we have to discard as the bags have a shelf life of just five days. The collection has gone down since Covid started,” he said. GMCH medical superintendent Dr Avinash Gawande said they too are facing shortage and would be organising blood donation camps. Dr Harish Warbhe, medical director at Lifeline Blood Bank, said he hasn’t seen such a huge shortage of platelets in the last 21 years of his career. “Dengue is widespread. More people are suffering from it and the outbreak has prolonged unlike previous years when the disease would subside within a couple of weeks,” he said. Dr Warbhe said they have doubled the number of camps yet the demand is too high. “We would supply 30 to 40 single donor platelets (SDPs) per month. It would go up to 10 SDPs per day in dengue season. This time we are getting 30 to 40 SDP demands a day. On August 15 and 16, we collected 165 random donor platelets (RDPs) through camps. All of them were taken in a day,” he said. As per doctors, the RDPs are extracted from donated blood using a machine which takes over 6 hours. The SDPs are prepared during the donation itself using aphaeresis machine. One SDP unit is equivalent to more than five RDP units.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/dengue-spurs-platelet-demand-blood-banks-face-shortage/articleshow/86049701.cms||Sarfaraz Ahmed

Nashik district collector Suraj Mandhare said, “We are now granting these rights to tehsildars to provide the NA permits to land parcels that have already been marked as residential areas in the development plan.” Mandhare said that the tehsildars are in possession of the land parcel numbers of all such areas. The tehsildars have to only to issue NA permits to the people who have their land parcels in these areas. These areas are within 200 metres from the boundaries of the areas that have been draft development plan or final development plan or even draft regional plan that have been declared by the officer. “There might be some land owners who have already sought NA permissions or even the ones who might have started the NA use of the land for residential, commercial or even industrial purpose. The tehsildars only have to issue a notice to these land owners, ask them to pay the challan and issue the NA permits,” collector said. The tehsildars will not take any action against any of the constructions carried out without NA permissions as the separate agency is looking into that aspect. The collector has ordered the tehsildars to ensure that the list of the property holders be finalized and all those who have still not taken NA permits for the land be issued the challan (tax payable) and ask them to clear the dues. The collector has also ordered the sub-divisional officers to keep a check on the developments every fortnight and ensure the authorities concerned are complying with the latest orders.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/tehsildars-get-powers-to-issue-na-permits-to-identified-land-parcels/articleshow/86045407.cms||Abhilash Botekar

Soon after his appointment, Fadnavis, in Mumbai, said that the party should be able to win the election based on the shape and direction former defence minister Manohar Parrikar gave the Goa BJP. Union minister for culture and tourism G Kishan Reddy and Union minister of state for railways and textiles Darshana Jardosh will serve as co-incharges for the Goa elections. “For the past four consecutive polls, I have been visiting Goa and I am familiar with the politics of Goa,” Fadnavis said. “For these polls, our beloved and Goa’s beloved Manohar ‘Bhai’ Parrikar will not be with us. But due to the shape and direction he has given the party in Goa, we should be able to win the polls.” Fadnavis said that the performance of Goa CM Pramod Sawant and his cabinet has been good, and would also contribute to a win. “Under PM Narendra Modi’s leadership, we will be able to have a BJP government yet again in Goa. Based on the work carried out by Goa CM Pramod Sawant and his cabinet in the state, I am confident that we will get elected once again,” Fadnavis said. He said the Maharashtra BJP unit will throw its weight behind the Goa BJP for the polls. “The Maharashtra BJP has always been active in Goa polls, and we will have the entire Maharashtra BJP’s support for the polls. We will get assistance from Union home minister Amit Shah and Union minister Nitin Gadkari for the Goa polls. We will do everything to form a BJP government again in Goa,” said Fadnavis. Sawant said that Fadnavis is familiar with Goa’s politics, and being a Marathi-speaking person, has an affinity to the state. “He has worked as in-charge in the past in other states like Bihar with success. We are sure to win 22-plus seats under his guidance,” Sawant told reporters. In a tweet, Sawant welcomed the appointments of Fadvanis, Reddy and Jardosh. “Their guidance will further strengthen the party’s resolve & preparedness to win 22+ seats in the 2022 assembly elections,” he tweeted.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/bjp-names-maha-ex-cm-fadnavis-as-its-in-charge-for-goa-elections/articleshow/86049736.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Court questions Eknath Khadse for saying he didn’t know of deal||MUMBAI: Eknath Khadse’s son-in-law Girish Chaudhari (47), who had purchased the disputed Pune land along with his mother-in-law Mandakini Khadse, was arrested on July 7. Eknath Khadse, who was with the BJP earlier, joined the NCP last year. “I hold that with glaring material and involvement of accused in an offence of money laundering... punishable under the PMLA, which is basically an economic offence wisely committed by misusing the position and powers by the responsible then Revenue Minister for the benefits of his consanguine ie wife and son-in-law. (Sic) If bail is granted in such offence the same will convey a bad message to the law abiding society,” the court said. The court also questioned how Khadse, in his statement to Enforcement Directorate, could say that he was unaware of the land deal entered by his family when an issue related to it was pending before him. It said all this prima facie reflects misconduct under the Prevention of Corruption Act. The court said Khadse’s statement indicates he had called meeting on April 12, 2016 in respect of the land. He further stated that on the same day, he got to know a writ petition was filed by the owner in respect of the land. The court noted that despite minutes of the meeting indicating that proceedings conducted by Khadse were kept in abeyance till the decision of the writ petition, his wife and son-in-law purchased the land on April 28, 2016. “This sale was based on public notice in the newspaper at the instance of applicant and his mother-in-law. Therefore, prima facie the contention of Mr Khadse that he was not aware of the said transactions…demonstrates how he had purposely overlooked and ignored the act of his wife and son-in-law for the reasons best known to him,” the court said. The court further said there is clear prima facie evidence to show how there was a trail of money in respect of proceeds of crime through six shell companies, which was used for purchasing the land. The court said no independent legal source belonging to Chaudhari or Mandakini Khadse was disclosed for purchasing the land. “I hold that a prima facie clear case is made out by the prosecution to hold that proceeds of crime have been generated through shell companies and the same were used by the applicant (Chaudhari) and Mrs Mandakini Khadse for purchasing the said land. All this was under the power and influence of Mr. Eknath Khadse, the then Revenue Minister. Hence, the applicant prima facie appears guilty for having committed an offence under.. PMLA,” the special court said. The court said investigation papers indicate there are a number of witnesses in the case. “Certainly there is every chance and possibility that they will be influenced. It cannot be ignored that Eknath Khadse is presently belongs to one of the ruling parties of the Government of Maharashtra. The way with which offence has been committed not only indicates the gravity thereof, but also the brain behind it and calculated steps to commit the same,” the court said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-court-questions-khadse-for-saying-he-didnt-know-of-deal/articleshow/86052535.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Delhi||Delhi lets its Covid guard down, Rs 31 crore collected as fine in August||NEW DELHI: Over Rs 32 crore was collected as fines in August from people ignoring Covid-appropriate behaviour such as wearing masks and maintaining physical distancing. Delhi government’s enforcement teams and Delhi Police collected, respectively, Rs 26.7 crore from 1.5 lakh bookings and Rs 5.6 crore from 29,100 violators till August 25. Some arrests were also made and many FIRs registered. With the festive season beckoning, vigilance is expected to increase to prevent any increase in coronavirus cases. The collection of the huge amount clearly indicates that many of the city’s people are complacent now and have dropped their guard because of the improved Covid situation and vaccination coverage. The fine collection in August, however, is much lower than in July, when Delhi government issued 2.1 lakh challans and collected Rs 36.2 crore. A month earlier in June, 1.6 lakh challans were issued and Rs 25.2 crore collected, while May saw the booking of 85,000 violators and collection of Rs 15.1 crore in fines. In July, Delhi government had deployed 159 enforcement teams with 129 vehicles to enforce Covid preventive measures in the 11 districts, shocked by the intensity of the second wave of the pandemic. In August too, the strength of the enforcement teams had remained the same. “Comparing the booking and fine amounts for July and August, it cannot be concluded that people are more Covid norm compliant now,” said a government official. “The enforcement teams are working hard to ensure compliance. That explains the big collections as fines.” With the reopening of schools for senior classes and the lifting of restrictions on the business hours for markets, restaurants and bars, almost all economic activities have resumed. This has led to an increase in the crowds in commercial hubs. The government and police focus now is on strict enforcement of Covid-appropriate behaviour and to curb the tendency of many people to throw caution to the winds despite the lurking threat of a resurgence in infections. Before the lockdown was fully relaxed, Covid containment measures were in focus because with markets and public places closed, few moved out of their houses. Only those who stepped out despite not being involved with essential and permitted activities were booked. With the crowds now returning to the markets and there being no way to stop people from stepping out, the idea is to make sure spread of the infection is prevented. In various DDMA meetings, concern has been expressed over the repeated ignoring of Covid-appropriate behaviour in public places. The authorities concerned have been advised to take measures to bring this to a halt. On Wednesday, the positivity rate in Delhi was 0.05% with 41 fresh cases detected among the 75,079 Covid tests conducted. No Covid death was reported. The positivity rate has been very low for many days. Currently, there are only 414 active Covid cases in the capital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-lets-its-covid-guard-down-rs-31cr-collected-as-fine-in-august/articleshow/86047304.cms||AlokKNMishra

High frequency indicators such as motor vehicle sales and GST receipts suggest growth will improve over July-September quarter, Vishrut Rana, Asia-Pacific economist at S&P, said in a presentation. He also said that the second wave of the pandemic has had a significant amount of “scarring” on growth. The severe pandemic wave cut into economic activity, leaving GDP reeling at nearly 17% below pre-pandemic trend, according to the ratings agency analysts’ presentation. The economy grew by an annual 20.1% in the April-June quarter, helped by a low base of last year. But economists expect the recovery to gather momentum and overall growth for the full fiscal year is expected to be in double-digits. S&P estimates the economy to grow by 9.5% in the current fiscal year and 7.5% in the next, while the nominal GDP growth is likely to be 10%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sp-expects-india-to-see-strong-eco-growth-ahead/articleshow/86053498.cms||---

The cops were head constable Balasubramanian, 45, attached to Armed Reserve Police and constable Arunkumar, 30 attached to Thiruvidaimarudhur station. The order comes a day after the duo and their friend Viji were booked by Tamil University police for vandalising a restaurant run by Ramkumar, 39, on Nanjikottai road. Police said Balasubramanian, Arun Kumar and Viji visited ‘Sangeetha’ restaurant run by Ramkumar late on September 6 and all of them were allegedly under the influence of alcohol. They ordered food but since there were more customers, there was some delay in serving it. Irked by this, the trio allegedly abused the son of the hotel owner verbally. They also poured the dishes on the boy before ransacking the shop by throwing the chairs and tables. When Ramkumar and his wife Mani came into the scene, the trio attacked them leading to a scuffle between the two sides. Arun Kumar sustained injuries on his head in the brawl while Balasubramanian got his leg fractured after his friend Viji hit him accidentally when he tried to take the car to flee. The police constables were admitted to hospitals while Viji escaped. Acting on a complaint from Ramkumar, Tamil University police booked the trio and were on the lookout for Viji. Since the constables were under treatment, they were not arrested.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/two-cops-suspended-for-ransacking-restaurant-assaulting-owner-relatives/articleshow/86049788.cms||---

Around 4.20 lakh farmers across the state had been waiting for power connections for their motor pump sets after remitting deposit since 2003. They had registered under three schemes — ordinary, self-financing and tatkal. However, despite repeated appeals, there was no progress, farmers said. While expressing happiness at the announcement, Thanjavur district Cauvery farmers protection association secretary Swamimalai S Vimalnathan said preference must be given to women, widows, ex-service men and transgender people in providing connections. Farmers who registered for power connections had spent thousands of rupees for desilting their borewells once they applied with the electricity board. Since almost 20 years were gone, they have to develop their wells again. Hence, the 1 lakh connections should be provided to ordinary, self-finance and tatkal schemes in 80:10:10 ratio, he added. Farmers from the delta districts have also written to the chief minister appealing to allot time to meet them for expressing their gratitude for the announcement.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/give-priority-to-vulnerable-in-1l-agri-power-connection/articleshow/86049841.cms||---

The ED case is that Rs 4.18 crore was routed in Shri Sai Shikshan Sanstha. Deshmukh’s petition denied it as a “factually false statement.” His petition seeking quashing of “malicious” ED summons is scheduled for a hearing before a single-judge bench of Justice S K Shinde at Bombay high court on Thursday. He said ED has not given a copy of the case it registered against him but issued five summons, the last one on August 16 itself, when the SC while declining interim relief gave him liberty to exercise his remedies under the law, “without even waiting for the order to be uploaded on the website of the Supreme Court.” He said he gave an appearance through his authorized representative and sought that his (Deshmukh’s) statement be recorded via electronic mode, but seeking his physical appearance shows “gross malice.” His petition also contends that “merely because the business availed unsecured loans from private party without getting into any formal loan agreement, it would be a far-fetched assumption to make that the applicant (Deshmukh) or his family was involved in money laundering.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/didnt-receive-any-cash-from-bar-owners-deshmukh/articleshow/86052554.cms||Swati Deshpande

But, the ministry has reportedly put a rider that the government should submit detailed reports projects (DPRs) and there should not be any change in the capacity, allocations and scope of the works. “The state government will provide all the reports and information sought by the ministry of water resources. The exercise has already begun,” Telangana special chief secretary (irrigation) Rajat Kumar told TOI on Wednesday. Officials said the water resources department had informed Telangana that it incorporated some irrigation projects in the unapproved list as either offtake levels or capacities of projects had changed over the years. In many cases, the DPRs were not submitted. Telangana CM K Chandrasekhar Rao met Union minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat a couple of days ago in Delhi and brought to his notice that many irrigation projects were listed as new projects, especially 11 projects in the Godavari basin, and they were marked as unapproved. The CM said Itchampally, Indira Sagar, Rajiv Sagar, Devadula Lift Irrigation Scheme (Tupakulagudem barrage) and Mukteshwar (Chinna Kaleshwaram) were approved and allocations were made prior to the bifurcation of the state. The Union minister asked the water resources department to sit with Telangana irrigation officials and clarify on the issues raised by them. The state government is hopeful of a clarification and also removal of the tag of unapproved projects. Meanwhile, acting upon the complaint to the Union minister by the Telangana CM that the KRMB was not responding to their letters on AP projects, the KRMB on Tuesday asked the AP government to submit DPR of Veligonda project. The Telangana government wrote a letter to KRMB on August 23, requesting the board to direct the AP government to stop Veligonda project works.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/jal-shakti-ministry-to-revise-list-of-unapproved-projects/articleshow/86050739.cms||Koride Mahesh

EESL and TSSPDCL would provide energy-efficient appliances at discounted prices in the discom’s jurisdiction. Before extending it to all districts, a pilot would be taken up in some divisions in the city. “Under the MoU, the programme will be designed and piloted with select consumers. It will subsequently be rolled out to cover all consumers of TSSPDCL. This programme will enable TSSPDCL to implement the project with zero investment, peak demand reduction when all consumers use appliances like ACs during summer season and give the discom an ability to comply with the state DSM regulation,” TSSPDCL said. Officials said with technical support from Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), EESL would facilitate the proposed programme through bringing in the necessary investments and technology required for providing the consumers of TSSPDCL with access to super-efficient air conditioners, IE3 motors, and BLDC fans. International Copper Association India (ICA India) would provide knowledge support for designing and piloting the programme. “This initiative will ensure optimal utilisation of available resources and tap the available energy saving potential in the state,” the discom said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/tsspdcl-consumers-to-get-energy-efficient-appliances/articleshow/86051641.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Hyderabad||No alliance with MIM, Rahul tells TPCC brass||Hyderabad: Congress former president Rahul Gandhi has categorically told party leaders from Telangana that there should be no alliance or any understanding with Asaduddin Owaisi’s All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) party. This direction was given to the new team of Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee led by A Revanth Reddy, which met Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday in Delhi. Rahul Gandhi discussed the political situation in Telangana for one-and-a-half hours with the TPCC office-bearers. The issue of AIMIM, which earlier had an alliance with Congress in the undivided state, came up for discussion when TPCC working president Mohammed Azharuddin and campaign committee convenor Azmathullah Hussaini were explaining the agenda of the party to win back the minority vote-bank. AICC general secretary (organisation) KC Venugopal minced no words in telling Revanth that the party high command was clear that the AIMIM was contesting the elections to divide the secular vote-bank of Congress which was indirectly boosting the poll prospects of the BJP. Venugopal said this in the presence of Rahul Gandhi. The Telangana Congress leaders were told to field a strong candidate against Asaduddin from Hyderabad Lok Sabha seat in next elections. The AIMIM, which is expanding its footprint beyond the Old City, is now contesting elections in various states. Revanth and campaign committee chairman Madhu Yashki Goud explained to Rahul Gandhi that the party’s fight is against the TRS-BJP-AIMIM axis in Telangana. The Congress leaders invited Rahul Gandhi for the launch of 10 lakh membership enrolment drive on December 9 coinciding with the announcement of giving statehood to Telangana by UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi on her birthday that day. Rahul Gandhi was also invited to address at least one public meeting every 100 days in Telangana. The first of these 100 day meetings would be held on unemployment issue by involving students and youth from the universities and colleges in the state. Rahul Gandhi asked how was the party countering the Dalit Bandhu scheme. Revanth along with others explained that the party was organising Dalita Girijana Dandora meetings to create awareness among the people that the scheme was a mere election stunt of CM KCR. Strengthen party at the booth-level, leaders told Rahul Gandhi directed the party leaders from Telangana to strengthen the party from polling booth level and launch uncompromising fight against corruption, unemployment, podu lands and interact with farmers groups, SCs, STs, women, minorities and BCs.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/no-alliance-with-mim-rahul-tells-tpcc-brass/articleshow/86051706.cms||Roushan Ali

National Backward Classes Welfare Association president R Krishnaiah, while addressing the BC Samara Sankharavam, a public meeting organised at Dharna Sthal near Indira Park, found fault with KCR for not urging Prime Minister Narendra Modi to introduce a bill in Parliament to provide political reservations to BCs in state assemblies and Parliament. “CM KCR submitted over 10 representations to PM Modi during his recent meeting with him in New Delhi. But not a single representation was submitted for the welfare of BCs. The chief ministers of Bihar and Maharashtra have been demanding enhancement of quota and caste-based enumeration of BCs by the central government,” Krishnaiah said. The meeting demanded that the TRS government immediately release Rs 3,400 crore towards fee reimbursement of 15 lakh students pursuing pharmacy, engineering and other courses in various colleges. These arrears have been pending from the last two years due to which the college managements were exerting pressure on students to pay the fee. V Hanumanth and Mallu Ravi from Congress, Anand Bhaskar and Lakshmi Narayana from BJP and Azeez Pasha from CPI along with Backward Classes (BC) Association leaders demanded that TRS fill up 2.50 lakh vacancies in the government sector.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/bc-leaders-demand-bandhu-like-scheme/articleshow/86050941.cms||---

Acting on a tip-off about the two women carrying psychotropic substance coming from Bharuch, cops kept a watch on vehicles passing by the toll plaza near Karjan and found the duo — Kamla alias Ganga Parmar and Dolly alias Leela Parmar — who confessed to buying the contraband from a man near Surat railway station for sale in Ahmedabad. On checking their luggage, police at first did not find anything suspicious. However, female constables frisked the duo inside a bathroom, and found the packets stuck to their bodies. The packets altogether contained marijuana weighing over 6kg, the police said. “Although they have not admitted, the two women seem to be professional drug peddlers. We have also received phone number of the man from whom they had purchased marijuana, so we will be tracking down that person,” said a police official. Police suspect that marijuana stock would have been brought to Surat from Odisha in huge quantity and later distributed to small peddlers in smaller quantities.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/two-abad-women-caught-with-ganja/articleshow/86046419.cms||---

---||Kolhapur||5-hr steady rainfall in Nashik, Nandgaon gets 123mm in 3 hrs||Nashik: The district received steady and continuous showers for over five hours that started late on Tuesday night. A bulk of that rainfall was received by the Nandgaon taluka, which witnessed water from the Lendi river overflowing and entering the railway station nearby. “After a dry spell of about a fortnight, the district received good rainfall on Tuesday night. Nandgaon taluka alone received 123mm,” said Bhagwat Doifode, the resident deputy collector of Nashik. The Nandgaon taluka usually receives an average of 141mm rainfall in September. On Tuesday night, over a period of just 3 hours, it received 123mm. “The heavy rainfall led to the flooding of the Lendi river. The water entered the railway station — it rose to the level of the platform,” said the officials of the Bhusawal division of the Central Railways. “The water, however, did not affect the running of the trains. Within an hour, the water had receded,” the officials added. The rain stopped early on Wednesday morning, though the day continued to be overcast. The administration recorded an average of 41mm of rainfall across the district. Nandgaon is on the eastern side of the district and is one of the most parched talukas here. Igatpuri and Trimbakeshwar talukas, which are known for heavy rain, however, received only 22 mm of rain each. Nashik district has so far received 77% of its average annual rainfall. However, Nandgaon and Malegaon talukas have already crossed their annual average rain figures. Nashik and Chandwad are the only two of the 15 talukas that are yet to receive at least 50% of the annual expected rainfall. In Igatpuri, the local police and highway police camped in the ghat sections to keep an eye on possible landslides or any other issue that may affect traffic movement. “Since the rainfall was normal, traffic movement too was normal,” a police officer said. The collective water stock in 23 major and medium dams stood at 68% of the total capacity of 65,664 million cubic feet (mcft), as against last year’s storage of 88%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/5-hr-steady-rainfall-in-nashik-nandgaon-gets-123mm-in-3-hrs/articleshow/86045527.cms||Abhilash Botekar

---||Delhi||Hunger finds a platform as swanky food plaza to open at New Delhi Railway Station||NEW DELHI: Passengers at New Delhi Railway Station are in for a lavish feast with the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation set to open a swanky food plaza on platform 16 on the Ajmeri Gate side of the station. The 6,000 sq ft facility, Pop n Hop, built by the PKS Hospitality Group of Chennai, will have takeaway counters, food stations, dining area and the presence of Haldiram's, Wow Momos, KFC, Doners and Burgers, Roll Station, Mughal Lane and Tea and Co. This round-the-clock facility will be among the first multi-brand food outlets with international companies at an Indian railway station. The initiative remedies the lack of such offerings at railway stations that forced people to carry their own meals or eat whatever fare was available on the platforms. Finally now, Pop n Hop gives travellers a choice of hygienic food from respected brands. Mihraz Ebrahim, managing director, PKS Hospitality, revealed that the firm has been associated with railway catering for 40 years and had 34 outlets at various stations in addition to similar facilities at airports abroad and restaurants in the Middle East. Even though they have food courts at the stations in Tiruchirappalli, Chennai and Bengaluru, the New Delhi one would be the first with international fast-food chains. The IRCTC food plaza shows progressive thinking by Indian Railways and a vision to bring railway stations at a par with airports, said Ebrahim. Shriram PM Monga, co-founder and principal consultant for F&B advisory firm SRED, put the concept together for Ebrahim in nine months and got the various brands on board. Deeming it a marquee project, Monga said such outlets go on to become city landmarks benefiting not just from the lakhs of train passengers using the station but also people living in the neighbourhood. With entrances on platform 16 and the station exterior, the premises has takeaway counters and space for a quick bite on the ground floor and seated dining on the first floor. The takeaway counters face the platform and passengers can directly access them when the train halts. Given on a lease of nine years with a provision to extend the lease by another three years, Ebrahim said from the time he applied for the tender, implemented the project while battling the pandemic restrictions and the lockdown and now to finally being able to opening the food plaza in a week's time, it had been an ambitious but satisfying period. He is thankful to the railway authorities for the support he got at every stage. Ebrahim disclosed that IRCTC had stressed on hygiene and food quality but that these were already the hallmark of the PKS Group, which is one of the biggest railway catering units in south India. “New Delhi Railway Station gets around three lakh passengers every day,” he said. “It needed a big food court and decent dining area with quality food on the menus. Being open round the clock will help travellers through the day irrespective of their train timings.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hunger-finds-a-platform-as-swanky-food-plaza-to-open-at-ndls/articleshow/86047533.cms||Amin Ali
---||Dehradun||150-year-old skywalk in Uttarkashi's Nelong Valley opened after 60 years defaced by tourists||DEHRADUN/UTTARKASHI: Gartang Gali, a 150-year-old skywalk in Uttarkashi's Nelong Valley, that reopened after 60 years was defaced by tourists within days, with many engraving their names on the sheesham railing of the historic bridge, prompting the government to direct police to lodge an FIR and catch those responsible. Videos also emerged of youngsters standing on the edge of the bridge in Nelong Valley and performing stunts at 11,000 ft in violation of norms. On Wednesday, tourism minister Satpal Maharaj, who had played a key role in renovation of the skywalk, spoke to district magistrate of Uttarkashi, Mayur Dixit, and directed that an FIR be lodged against the culprits. “The bridge was closed after the 1962 India-China war for security reasons. It took a long time to open it to tourists, but it is very disappointing to see people defacing it and performing stunts even though we have signage prohibiting such actions. We can’t let such things go unpunished,” the minister told TOI. The skywalk underwent repairs costing Rs 64 lakh and was thrown open to the public on August 23 after almost six decades. Within a fortnight, 500 tourists have visited the 136-metre-long skywalk that falls under the jurisdiction of Gangotri National Park (GNP). GNP authorities have now given a complaint in writing to Uttarkashi police. Superintendent of police (Uttarkashi) Manikant Mishra told TOI a case would be registered soon. The park's administration has deployed guards to rein in hooliganism at the bridge which was originally built by Pathans from Peshawar as one of the routes for reaching Tibet from India. Deputy director of GNP, R N Pandey, said they were going through videos shared online to look for those responsible. “Stunts of all kinds, jumping, dancing, etc, on the skywalk violate norms. Visitors are informed of these prohibitions before they enter. They have been put in place to avoid any damage to the structure and for personal safety. Those flouting norms will be booked. We are looking at the videos that have surfaced online,” Pandey said. Local residents also expressed their anger. Tilak Soni, a homestay owner in the area, said, “It is sad to see visitors indulging in such vandalism at the skywalk. Administration should identify and punish these anti-social elements.” A few months ago, Haridwar police had launched ‘Operation Maryada’ to crack down on errant tourists after videos of them smoking hookah on the ghats of Ganga surfaced online. Banners were put up in Haridwar warning strict action against those involved in hooliganism at religious places and tourist sites.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/150-yr-old-historic-skywalk-opens-after-60-yrs-defaced-by-tourists/articleshow/86045542.cms||Kautilya Singh
---||Delhi||Dhaka to Manila: Only 12 cities fare worse than Delhi on safety index||NEW DELHI: Delhi ranks a lowly 48th out of 60 major cities across the world in Safe Cities Index 2021, beating only the likes of Manila, Casablanca, Cairo, Dhaka and Riyadh. With an overall score of 56.1 in the report by The Economist Intelligence Unit and NEC Corporation, Delhi, however, has performed better than Mumbai on almost all parameters, which include 76 indicators covering digital, health, infrastructure, personal and environmental security sectors. The national capital couldn’t enter the top 40 in any of the five key parameters, ranking 48th on digital security, 40th on health security, 44th on infrastructure security, 41st on personal security and 49th on environmental security. With an overall rank of 50th, Mumbai stands 53rd on digital security, 44th on health security, 48th on infrastructure security, 50th on personal security and 46th on environmental security. Overall, Copenhagen in Denmark has the highest score, followed by Toronto in Canada and Singapore. Sydney in Australia, Tokyo in Japan and Amsterdam in The Netherlands come next. With Covid-19 impacting the world drastically for almost two years now, health remained a key focus in this year’s report, the fourth edition of Safe Cities Index. Environmental security was a new pillar, the report says. Fang Zhao, professor of innovation and strategy at Staffordshire Business School, says, “Covid-19 has changed the whole concept of urban safety. Digital security is now an even higher priority as more work and commerce have moved online and those responsible for infrastructure safety have to adjust to dramatic changes in travel patterns and where residents consume utilities.” Handling of the pandemic by cities was a key factor in the health rankings, while digital security looked at access to the internet, utilisation of technology in moving towards a smart city and the security being offered to its citizens through technology. Both Delhi and Mumbai have smart city plans over the next five years. The infrastructure security sector took a look at how well a city was able to provide basic infrastructure to its citizens, while personal security correlated income levels to a large extent to determine overall individual security. In the final sector, environment security, a city’s level of economic development closely correlated with its environmental security scores. In environmental security, Shanghai ranks 38th, Beijing 48th, just ahead of New Delhi at 49th. At 46th, Mumbai beats both these cities. From the last edition, the top of the list has changed, but the “first division” holders remain almost the same. Prior to this, Tokyo, Singapore and Osaka — always in that order — have been the index leaders. “This year, Copenhagen comes first, with 82.4 points out of 100, and Toronto follows with 82.2. This change reflects not a tectonic shift, but more a reordering among cities that have always come close to the top,” the report states. “In all four editions, six cities — Amsterdam, Melbourne, Tokyo, Toronto, Singapore and Sydney — have all figured among the leading 10, with only a few points separating them.” Cities with higher scores in Human Development Index also do better in the Safe Cities results, the report adds. “Income can help fund safety-increasing investments; but economic growth, in turn, depends on an environment benefiting from every kind of security,” it states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dhaka-to-manila-only-12-cities-fare-worse-than-delhi-on-safety-index/articleshow/86047547.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok
---||Kolkata||Might need new booster shots to fight Mu, 4 other strains: Experts||Kolkata: Experts endorsed the stricter screening of passengers arriving in India from countries where the Mu and four other new Covid variants have been detected, pointing out that the third wave could be dangerous if these strains turned out to be virulent enough or genetically different from the existing ones. This, they felt, could add to the threat from existing variants, which could bypass the vaccines, necessitating new booster doses for them. Mu and the other four variants—Eta, Iota, Kappa and Lambda—were, however, still “variants of interest” and were yet to be classified as “variants of concern” by WHO, said Peerless Hospital microbiologist Bhaskar Narayan Chaudhuri. “Delta and Delta Plus remain most virulent for they are not preventable by existing vaccines. The new variants, including Mu, are under study and there is yet no proof that these could cause severe infection or are quickly transmissible. Initial reports suggest at least Mu is preventable by a vaccine like Covishield,” said Chaudhuri. But the jury was still out on Mu, said Chaudhuri, adding if it did turn out to be highly transmissible or affected the lungs, then it’s a major worry. “This will be a third one that can evade vaccine immunity,” he said. Mu has genetic differences with the other known variants, some initial studies say and is causing infections in multiple countries. What makes Mu a matter of concern is that it has what the WHO calls a “constellation of mutations that indicate potential properties of immune escape”. “We need to guard against all new variants. Whether it can penetrate our vaccine-immunity or not will be known once its clinical profile and gene sequencing have been done. If Mu is indeed a constellation of mutations, then it is going to be a threat, like Delta, possibly a bigger one if it’s got multiple properties that are not resisted by our vaccines. In that case, we not only need to screen those arriving from countries where it has been detected but also explore the possibility of a new vaccine that will work against the new variants,” said RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences intensivist Sauren Panja. Studies don’t rule out the possibility that Mu’s genetic changes might make it more transmissible, allow it to cause more severe disease and escape the immune response driven by vaccines or infection with previous variants, according to initial studies. This, in turn, might make it less responsive to treatments. But existing vaccines will still offer significant resistance to all variants, said CMRI Hospital director of pulmonology Raja Dhar. “The degree of severity will be less for the vaccinated, whatever be the variant. But we now need to develop booster doses that will resist the new strains and are different to the ones that we have. Much like the influenza vaccine, which is altered every year according to the strain, Covid vaccine, too, needs to evolve,” said Dhar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/might-need-new-booster-shots-to-fight-mu-4-other-strains-experts/articleshow/86049982.cms||Prithvijit Mitra
---||Delhi||Found after 2 months by Delhi Police, Uttar Pradesh girl pregnant, ‘went on free will’||NEW DELHI: The 13-year-old girl who allegedly went missing from Uttar Pradesh’s Gorakhpur and was rescued two months later by Delhi Police is now around seven months pregnant. The girl’s alleged friend-cum-lover continues to remain in police custody, while she has refused to go to her parents’ house. In her statement under Section 164 CrPc, the girl stated that she went of her own free will and didn’t want to stay with her family as they had “not spoken properly” to her friend. When TOI reached out to the girl’s family, they alleged that the man was involved with other women in the neighbourhood and had committed petty thefts. “My daughter feels she’s in love, but he is not a nice man. I want her to be safe and healthy. She had told me during her medical examination that she won’t have the baby. I don’t want her to have it at this stage. We hope that the court takes a decision soon,” said the girl’s mother. While the girl claimed that she was 17 years old, the age according to her Aadhaar card was 13 years. A medical examination would be carried out to ascertain her exact age. The girl said she met the man around a year and a half ago. While they liked each other, the families did not agree to their relationship. “On April 13, my parents took me to Gorakhpur. Later, I boarded another train midway. I spoke to Akash and on July 13 we left Delhi for Howrah and reached the following day. We stayed in a rented room for around a month and a half,” she stated. “The man was once thrashed by people for stealing a mobile phone. He would try to charm women by bringing them cakes on their birthday. His reputation was not good, which is why I wanted my daughter to maintain a distance. I have four children, two sons and two daughters,” alleged the girl’s mother. The mother added, “On one occasion, when she had gone to his house, the local boys started teasing my son that his sister had gone to his house. That day, I told her it would be good if she stayed away from him. I even called him home and told him to stay away from her. My daughter is the most stubborn among all my children, but we did everything for her and gave her anything she wanted. Even when she went missing, we tried everything to get her back.” The case has now been transferred to Delhi Police, who will seek custody of the man. He is currently in Uttar Pradesh Police’s custody. Sources said his family disowned him long ago. He doesn’t have any previous criminal records.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/found-after-2-months-up-girl-pregnant-went-on-free-will/articleshow/86047563.cms||Sakshi Chand

The court of additional chief judicial magistrate (ACJM) issued the warrant against Yesudas Bernabas Christudas on Wednesday after he ducked several summons and didn’t appear for the hearing on multiple occasions. Yesudas had directed Hindi movie ‘30 minutes’ with Hrishita Bhatt and Hiten Paintal in lead roles. The movie was released in 2016. The director’s whereabouts is currently not known, sources said. He is not in his hometown Ghaziabad or in Mumbai. The complaint against Yesudas was registered by one Ratna Bajpai. Giving details about the case, Bajpai, 55, said, “I and my husband met Yesudas in Delhi in 2016, at my brother-in-law’s house. He introduced himself as a movie director. After a few meetings, Yesudas became a family friend. It was then that he borrowed Rs 20 lakh from us as his movie was about to be released and he promised to return the money in five months.” Yesudas gave a cheque of Rs 20 lakh and asked Bajpai to withdraw the money from his account soon after his movie was released. “We didn’t hesitate to support him as he was well known in our circle. But, soon after his movie was released, he disappeared for nearly two years. The cheque was also dishonoured by his bank,” Bajpai said. “In 2018, we managed to meet him. He again promised us to pay the money and gave another cheque. But it was also rejected by the bank. So we lodged a complaint in the court, where he appeared and promised to return the money. But, later, he stopped coming for hearings.” Advocate Gurvinder Singh, who is representing Bajpai in the case, said, “The court has issued a non-bailable warrant against Yesudas. Proceeding under section 82 (proclamation for person absconding) of CrPC has also been initiated. The warrant has been shared with SSP Ghaziabad by the court. We are expecting that he will be arrested soon and brought to Shahjahanpur court.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bareilly/court-issues-non-bailable-warrant-against-ghaziabad-based-film-director/articleshow/86040623.cms||Kanwardeep Singh

There has been an intense spell of heavy rain in the Nandurbar district in the 24-hour period ending on Wednesday morning. Although the intensity of the rain had subsided by the evening, there is a prediction of more spells of intense rain in the district. District officials said that the youth had gone to see the overflowing stream when he suddenly slipped and fell into it. He has washed away. “Search operations are on to trace the body,” added the officials. Four talukas of the district — Akrani (102mm), Shahada (146mm), Taloda (66mm) and Akkalkuwa (77mm) — received the bulk of the rain in the 24 hours till Wednesday morning. Woman dies in ambulance stranded due to landslide “There was a landslide in Chandsali ghat, which connects Taloda and Akrani talukas, and movement of vehicles has been stopped. An ambulance, on its way to Dhadgaon to ferry a woman patient from her home to the hospital got stuck in the landslide. The woman could not be shifted to the hospital and she passed away,” said officials. The administration has deployed earth movers to remove the debris so that vehicles can start plying again. Chetan Girase, the Sub-divisional officer (SDO) of Sahada, said that heavy rainfall in Sahaha has partially inundated different areas. “The local court and the office of the SDO were waterlogged as the drains were chocked and the local canal started overflowing,” added Girase. Manpower has been deployed to clear the waterlogging in the low-lying areas as soon as possible. The district administration has issued an alert for the villagers residing along the banks of the Tapi river because a huge quantum of water is being discharged from the Hatnur dam in Jalgaon. The Tapi river flows into the Nandurbar district from Jalgaon. Nandurbar district officials said the villagers have been advised not to venture into the river.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/youth-washed-away-in-nandurbars-akrani-taluka/articleshow/86045551.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

Maurya tendered her resignation to President Ram Nath Kovind citing personal reasons, her office has confirmed. It came just days after she met Union home minister Amit Shah in Delhi on September 5. The timing of the resignation has fuelled speculations that Maurya may be given a role in the BJP's UP state unit before impending assembly polls in 2022. While those close to her remained tight-lipped over her next move, there were also talks of the 64-year-old contesting elections in UP. Maurya had earlier served as the mayor of Agra from 1995 to 2000 and had also unsuccessfully contested UP assembly polls in 2007 on a BJP ticket from the Etmadpur seat. She was a member of the National Women’s Commission in 2002. Constitutional expert Subhash Kashyap said there is no "cooling off" period required for governors if they choose to contest elections. “They can join electoral politics soon after demitting office,” he said. Maurya was appointed governor of the Himalayan state in August 2018 at the end of Krishna Kant Paul’s tenure. She was the second woman to hold the position after Margaret Alva, who was governor of Uttarakhand from August 2009 to May 2012. A top government source said the new governor would be named by the president soon.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-governor-resigns-likely-to-get-role-in-up-bjp/articleshow/86045577.cms||Gaurav Talwar
---||Delhi||Delhi: Harassment? Two kill self at same police station in 3 months||NEW DELHI: Around noon on June 4, sub-inspector (SI) Rahul Singh allegedly shot himself with his service revolver at Pandav Nagar police station. Around three months later, a home guard, Brij Lal (46), hanged himself from the ceiling fan at the same police station. He also left behind a suicide note alleging harassment by the SHO. Both the suicides are now a talking point among cops as many questions remain unanswered. The SHO, inspector Vidyadhar, was sent to the district lines after Lal’s death on September 5. Lal was taken to LBS Hospital, where he was declared dead. The body was shifted to the mortuary and a medical board was formed for the autopsy. He is survived by his wife and four children. Kuldeep, Lal’s nephew, told TOI, “The SHO would harass him and even abuse him on small things. The family was aware about it, but we thought the SHO was doing it since he was in a position of power. We didn’t know it would reach a stage where my uncle would take his life. He left home like usual and later we came to know that he had hanged himself.” Investigations so far have revealed that Lal was in debt of at least Rs 25 lakh. “We are yet to get the exact details, but this is what we know. We will conduct an inquiry. People have told us that he put a lot of money in committees, but these facts are yet to be ascertained. A suicide note has been recovered, which mentions the SHO’s name saying he would abuse him often,” said an officer privy to the probe. Regarding the debt, Kuldeep said, “If my uncle was in so much debt, then people would at least come and ask us for their money on some occasion. But no one has ever come. Yes, people do invest money in committees, but that is never an issue. We want his wife to get the same job and compensation as he has four children, the youngest aged 10 years. He had undergone a bypass surgery for his heart ailment.” On the other hand, Singh’s father-in law has been running from pillar to post seeking help from the authorities. Singh allegedly shot himself shortly after getting married. His wife, Pooja, said, “As we had gotten married recently, he had not shared his work-related details much. I did try asking him, but he would say that he was at work throughout the day and didn’t want to talk about it at home too. I don’t know why he took the extreme step.” Several of Singh’s batchmates started a social media campaign demanding justice for him. An audio clip also went viral in which Singh allegedly spoke to his colleague about the issues he was facing. Senior police officers said in Singh’s case, there was no allegation on the SHO and inquiry in Lal’s case was being carried out by the additional DCP (East).||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/harassment-2-kill-self-at-same-police-station-in-3-months/articleshow/86047571.cms||Sakshi Chand

The duo had allegedly participated in the pride parade at Azad Maidan in February 2020, but were accused of raising slogans in support of Sharjeel Imam, the Jawaharlal Nehru University student who was then arrested on charges of sedition for his inflammatory speech. Advocate Vijay Hiremath had sought the relief for the two students. Allowing the pleas, the court said, “Interim order dated February 12, 2020, is hereby made absolute with all the conditions.” The duo had moved separate pleas before the sessions court in February last year as they apprehended arrest in the case registered under various sections of the IPC. The defence had then submitted that the duo had not participated in the alleged sloganeering in support of Sharjeel. It was also submitted that they did not understand Hindi very well as they hail from Kerala. The defence had told the court that they were part of a peaceful gathering of queer community assembled at Azad Maidan on February 1, 2020, and they are mostly seen in the alleged video recording while waiving a blue coloured flag, a symbol of the Dalit community.

Admissions at most places, including sought-after institutes, have been slow with over half the seats remaining empty. “Principals are supposed to tell the department details, such as the number of students taking admission in that particular cycle and the number of vacancies, so that we know the pace at which seats are filling up. Last year, the deadline was extended multiple times as a result of which new classes could start in the third week of December. But this time, we are determined to follow the UGC guidelines and start first semester classes by October 1,” said an education department official. “We have been instructed to upload the figures on the department’s website every day. In our college, we started uploading the details on Monday,” said the principal of a south Kolkata college. The department has also asked for the subjects witnessing maximum enrolments and those with least number of takers. “This will help us rationalise seats in future and focus on in-demand subjects,” said the education official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/update-admission-details-daily-colleges-told/articleshow/86050090.cms||Zeeshan Javed

Since all the victims showed similar symptoms and complained of stomach pain and breathlessness, the villagers had alleged exorcism. After watching videos and photographs related to the incident on social media, Niraj Kumar, the head of the department of zoology at Laxmi Narayan Dubey College, visited the village on Wednesday. A thorough investigation of the house, which belongs to a farmer, Rakesh Prasad, revealed that all the deaths were caused by snakebite. The professor, who has been conducting research on the rescue and rehabilitation of snakes, carefully examined the bedroom where the victims used to sleep. He found several holes and gaps in the walls which were not plastered. He also saw a layer of skin of the common krait and asked Rakesh to inform the forest department immediately. “After reading about the symptoms in newspapers and examining the house myself, I realised that the five people had died of snakebite. I found a layer of skin, which the common krait had shed as part of a process called ecdysis, in one of the rooms,” Niraj told this reporter. A noted surgeon, Dr Ashutosh Sharan, also claimed that it was a case of snakebite. According to sources, Rakesh and the remaining members of his family have vacated the house and taken shelter elsewhere. Meanwhile, a team of doctors, which had conducted the autopsy, is waiting for the forensic report.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/mystery-solved-all-5-deaths-in-a-family-caused-by-snakebite/articleshow/86050097.cms||Chandra Bhushan Pandey

The district agriculture officials said crop-damage assessment is underway. District collector Abhijit Raut visited Jamner on Wednesday to make an on-the-spot assessment of damage to crops and other properties in the taluka. He was accompanied by senior district officials. Some farmers in the taluka said the 8-10 villages bore the maximum brunt and crops in over 200 hectare were completely damaged. Sriram Patil, a farmer, told TOI that 17,000 of his banana plants were damaged. “The bananas were ready to harvest. However, the showers have ruined my plantation. I have suffered a loss of over Rs 35 lakh,” he said. Gopal Patil, another farmer, said his banana, maize, and cotton crops were damaged. “Although I am yet to ascertain the quantum of loss, it would be over Rs 4-5 lakh. The rainfall had an adverse impact on our standing crops,” added the farmer. The farmers have demanded that the state government ensure they get the crop insurance money fast. Tushar Patil, a Jalgaon-based agronomist attached with a private irrigation firm, said the crop damage in these villages has been substantial. “The bigger banana plants, with fruits on them, have wilted due to the rain and gusty winds. But many of the smaller saplings, which are about 2 feet in height, have survived the weather onslaught. The farmers can cultivate them to salvage some of their investments,” he said. Jamner received more than 14 mm of rain in the 24 hours ending on Wednesday morning, but there were strong winds and the roofs of some of the houses in the taluka were blown away. A person was also washed away. Meanwhile, the Nashik agriculture department has asked the taluka officers to examine whether there has been any crop damage in the district. “Our feedback is that there could be some crop damage in Nandgaon taluka, which received the highest rainfall in the district. The details would be known within the next couple of days,” said the department officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/standing-crops-damaged-in-jamner-taluka-of-jalgaon-dist/articleshow/86045580.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

The gang used biscuits dunked in water and laced them with itching powder to divert the attention of their target while another accomplice would walk away with the person’s valuables. With the arrest of the two — Suresh Naidu (27) and Krishna Shetty (38) — the police claimed to have solved three cases in which the gang had fled with Rs 1.25 lakh, a gold chain and Rs 40,000 from different people. Three others — Shetty’s father, Uday, and two others — are wanted. All five are from Karnataka. “They would come to the city to commit crimes. They put up rented rooms. We have seized itching powder, biscuit packets and cash from their rented room in Ambernath,” said inspector of L T Marg police station, Om Wangate. In the first case, Shital Mishra (55), a driver, had lodged a complaint on August 17, said a police officer. “He had a bag containing office money. The accused first threw a wet biscuit and sprayed itching powder around his neck. Another gang member told him of a stain on his shirt. Mishra did not realise it was a soggy biscuit,” said the officer. They asked him to step aside so that they could help him.

---||Delhi||Transgression: They have got exclusive toilet at Delhi Metro stations, but not right name or symbol for it||NEW DELHI: Social activist and the first transgender person to head a Covid-care centre in India, Dr Aqsa Shaikh, wrote to the National Human Rights Commission on Wednesday against Delhi Metro Rail Corporation’s announcement last month on allowing transgender persons access to separate toilets at metro stations meant for the differently-abled. Her grouse is that the term ‘ubhaylingi’ in Hindi for transgender people is not acceptable to the community because it is used commonly for intersex people. In her complaint, Shaikh added that the half-male-half-female image used to depict transgender people was erroneous too. This icon also contravened the Delhi chief secretary’s order of February 12 directing the use of T as a symbol to mark toilets for transgenders. “The bilingual signage uses the word ‘ubhaylingi’, which is not the acceptable term for transgender persons. This term means intersex persons and since the press release mentions that these signage has been installed in 347 toilets across Delhi Metro stations, there is a huge amplification and spread of the incorrect term,” said Shaikh, who identifies as a transwoman. She is an associate professor at Hamdard Institute of Medical Sciences. Shaikh told TOI, “If the chief secretary has already mandated that T would be used for toilets for transgender persons, then I am not sure why another symbol was used,” said Shaikh. She has requested the use of ‘transgender person’ to be used in Hindi in all signage and a T as the symbol for transgender persons. Also pointing out that DMRC had not appointed a complaint officer, her letter to NHRC noted, “As per Section 11 of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act 2019, every establishment shall designate a person to be a complaint officer to deal with the complaints relating to violations of the provisions of the Act.” In response, DMRC said in a statement on Wednesdaythat the term “ubhaylingi’ was adopted from the gazette notification issued by the Union social justice ministry and said the rail company was open to replacing it with any other Hindi term with the due approval of the authorities. “As an organisation always striving to respect the sensibilities of every individual using its services, DMRC appreciates the feedback and the points raised,” said Anuj Dayal, executive director, communications, DMRC. DMRC claimed it studied signage for toilets for transgender persons across the globe and said the icon it eventually adopted was the most easily identifiable one. “There was no intent to cause any hurt by placing such signage. However, DMRC will rework and replace the signage as needed,” the statement said. It added that the company was working to designate a complaint officer as required by the Transgender Act.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/transgression-they-have-got-exclusive-toilet-at-metro-stns-but-not-right-name-or-symbol-for-it/articleshow/86047682.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok
---||Kochi||Need focus on challenges due to demographic transition: Study||Kochi: Kerala needs to focus on challenges emerging from the demographic transition as the strategies adopted by the state now will determine the future course of transition, says a recent study by the Centre for Socio-Economic and Environmental Studies, Kochi. Given its early onset, demographic transition in Kerala is now at the matured stage with fertility below the replacement level, life expectancy at birth above 75 years, decadal growth rate of population at 5% during 2001-2011 with negative growth in two districts. The demographic advantage has created certain unique challenges for the state that are yet to be visible at the national level. The study by Baishali Goswami, associate fellow of CSES, aims to synthesize the current trajectory of the transition in the state in light of the existing trends experienced worldwide with regard to advanced mortality and fertility transitions. Despite a long history of mortality transition coupled with an advanced epidemiological transition, Kerala is yet to reach the advanced stage of mortality transition with mortality concentrated in ages 80 years and above, the study pointed out. Kerala successfully prevented infectious and communicable diseases at the early stage of the transition and ensured better longevity for its population. Life expectancy at birth increased from 62 years in 1970-75 to 72 years in 1996-2000 and then to 75 years in 2014-18. Reduction in mortality was mainly concentrated in the early years of life. To sustain this, the state now needs to focus on the health problems of adulthood that are much harder to prevent, in an age-disaggregated manner, says the study. With mortality transition, Kerala experienced an obvious shift in the disease pattern from communicable to non-communicable diseases (NCD) and emerged as the state experiencing the highest level of epidemiological transition in the country. Between 1990 and 2016, NCD accounts for three-fourths of the total burden of diseases in the state and thus shifted the mortality up to mid-seventies. Given the global experience, the study highlights that there remains untapped potential in the state to postpone the age-specific mortality from degenerative diseases from the current age group of 70+ further to the advanced age group of 80+. Kerala, with the highest proportion of elderly among all states in India, has already started recognizing the unique health needs of ‘elderly’ as a group. The study calls for further refinement in strategies targeting interventions to address the intra-group differentials in mortality to postpone the death rates to advanced ages of 80 and above. This also calls for age-sex disaggregated data across major killer diseases in the advanced age groups.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/need-focus-on-challenges-due-to-demographic-transition-study/articleshow/86050139.cms||---

The second wave of the pandemic had virtually crippled Malegaon’s powerloom sector, the second largest in the state after Bhiwandi. Several units were forced to cease operations following low demand for the product, coupled with high cost of yarn. There are over 3 lakh powerlooms in Malegaon engaging about 2 lakh workers. “The revival trend of the Malegaon powerloom sector is on and over 75-80% powerlooms have re-started operations in phases about a month ago. This has enabled over 1.5 lakh workers to return to work,” Sajid Ansari, president of one of the biggest powerloom associations in Malegaon, told TOI. The powerloom owners have been receiving orders from traders in places like Rajasthan, Gujarat and Mumbai since there will be demand for new clothes during the festive season. Malegaon’s powerlooms produce grey cloth from yarn like cotton and polyester and sell them to traders. The cloth is processed, dyed and printed before being sent for stitching. “Presently, one powerloom unit on an average makes about 80 metres of grey cloth. In fact, many of the units have been operating in two shifts, six days a week, to ensure that the product is supplied in time,” added Ansari. At the same time, Ansari maintained that some powerlooms are still shut since the owners faced asevere financial crisis during the second wave of the pandemic. Another powerloom owner, Raees Ansari, said the labourers have heaved a sigh of relief as a majority of them are now back to work. “Our main concern is the high cost of yarn that we are forced to buy from private parties at a much higher cost. This is having an impact on our production cost. We would appeal to the Union government to restart the National Textile Corporation Mills that would enable us to buy yarn at a competitive price,” added Raees. Aziz Shah Jumman Shah, a powerloom labourer, said that he was happy to be back to work as he was facing a severe financial crisis since the powerloom had remained closed for a long time. “Things have improved but it’s a long way to go before we reach the production stage during the pre-Covid times. At the time, a powerloom in Malegaon would produce over 100 metres of grey cloth a day,” he recalled.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nashik/festive-season-brings-cheer-to-malegaons-powerloom-sector/articleshow/86045677.cms||Ranjan Dasgupta

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will lay the foundation stone of the project on Tuesday. “The timeline to complete the project is six months,” Aligarh deputy commissioner (industry) Srinath Paswan told TOI. The UP Expressway Industrial Development Authority, nodal agency for the defence corridor project, has allotted land to 19 companies from Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Pune, Delhi, Noida, Ghaziabad, Lucknow and Aligarh at the Aligarh node. Nine of them are from Aligarh, including Nitya Creation India and Deep Explo Equipments Pvt Ltd. Among others are Anchor Research Labs in Greater Noida, Syndicate Innovations International Ltd in Ghaziabad, New Space Research and Technologies in Bengaluru, Tractix Opto Dynamics LLP in Hyderabad, Crimson Energy Experts in Pune and Milkor Defence Pvt Ltd in Delhi. Aligarh is one of six nodes in the corridor — the others are Lucknow, Kanpur, Agra, Chitrakoot and Jhansi — which was planned to “reduce foreign dependency of Indian aerospace and defence sector”, the project website says. CM Yogi Adityanath visited Aligarh on Wednesday to assess preparations for the PM’s visit next week. During his visit, he spoke about the other big project the PM will lay the foundation stone of, a state university named after Jat icon Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh. “The PM’s visit will honour Raja Mahendra Pratap Singh and link the city with the defence corridor,” he said. BJP legislators who attended the CM’s review meeting said about 1.5 lakh people are expected to attend the PM’s events. Among them will be Mahendra Pratap Singh’s great grandson Charat Pratap Singh. “It’s a great feeling,” he said. “The present government has taken the initiative to honour him … It is a recognition of his contribution."||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/agra/rs-1200cr-investment-expected-in-aligarhs-defence-corridor/articleshow/86040646.cms||Anuja Jaiswal
---||Delhi||Dry fruit prices soar in Delhi as Afghan crisis costs dear||NEW DELHI: This Diwali, be prepared to pay more for dry fruits, which are widely gifted during the festivities. Due to trading with Afghanistan taking a hit, dry fruits are in short supply in the wholesale market. Though traders have made alternative arrangements to fill the gap, this has led to an estimated 40% increase in wholesale rates. Dry fruits like raisins, figs, apricots, Kishori pistachio, licorice and Gurbandi almonds have witnessed a steep hike in prices. For instance, the price of almonds has increased by Rs 150 per kg, while the rates of Kagzi almonds have risen by more than Rs 300 per kg. When TOI spoke to traders at Khari Baoli, the wholesale market for dry fruits in Old Delhi, they said the main reason for the increase in the prices of dry fruits was the halt in supply of goods from Afghanistan, disruption in the growth of raisins and figs, lack of communication from suppliers and a sudden shortage of containers. Suresh Bhargava, a member of Khari Baoli Sarva Vyapar Mahasangh (KBSVM), said old supplies were coming, but at a very slow rate via Iran. “Due to restrictions for import/export via Pakistan, pressure has increased on us. We are assuming that supply will improve either near or after the festivities, which is why rates will remain high. We will be forced to get supplies from the neighbouring states, but things will take time to normalise,” he added. The rate of Afghani raisins has increased from Rs 600 to Rs 750, Kishori pistachio from around Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,100, apricot from Rs 400 to Rs 550, Gurbandi badam from Rs 700 to Rs 850 and Kagzi almonds from Rs 1,600 to Rs 1,900. The traders claimed they were talking to the Centre to intervene and help in smooth supply of items from Afghanistan. “For the past one month, severe disruption in supply of goods from Kabul to India has been noticed, leading to a shortage of almonds, raisins, figs and raisins, among other dry fruits. During Rakshabandhan this year, we faced issues due to shortage of Kishori pista, which is primarily used in sweets for decoration. If a third Covid-19 wave doesn’t occur, people will start coming to the markets and a major price hike will be expected,” said Vijay Gupta, a dry fruits trader. Rishi Mangla, the chairman of KBSVM, claimed, “Due to the existing problems, we can’t trust suppliers in other countries by making advance payments for bulk supply prior to the festivities. Many of us were dealing with suppliers from the Sikh community who have been working in Afghani markets for decades. But many of them have returned to India now.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/dry-fruit-prices-soar-as-afghan-crisis-costs-dear/articleshow/86047633.cms||Vibha Sharma

There are a 100 libraries which run 24x7 for the benefit of students in the district. There are nearly 20 to 25 such libraries within a 2 km radius of Saptapur and Basavanagar in Dharwad. Dharwad is also known as Vidyakashi in North Karnataka region, where many students from backward districts, including Ballari, Raichur, Bagalkot and Vijayapura, come to study, since many coaching centres offer different types of courses, and coaching to prepare candidates to face IAS, KAS, PSI and other competitive exams. To facilitate students, many people have now started the 24X7 library concept, to enable candidates, who are preparing to crack competitive exams, to study for long hours, in the day and at night. According to the source from the library association, there are 100 libraries in Dharwad district. Earlier, students attempting to crack competitive exams used to study in gardens, under trees, in temples and college campuses. Now they are turning to 24x7 libraries. About 20,000-30,000 students are enrolled in the libraries. Each 24X4 library has separate boy’s and girl’s sections, WiFi, drinking water, English and Kannada newspapers and magazines, and books to prepare for competitive exams. In each library, a minimum 100- 200 students have registered their names to avail of this facility. A fee ranging from Rs Rs 500 to Rs 700 is charged from each student every month, who want to be members of a 24x7 library, said sources. 24x7 Libraries Association of Dharwad president Ravindra Kamaladinni told TOI that the concept was first started in Delhi, and has now come to Dharwad. “I have opened a 24x7 library to help students to crack competitive exams by reading books in a pleasant atmosphere, without any disturbance. Earlier, Students used to study in the KUD campus, parks, Ulavi Channabasawere temple premises and other places. Due to the climate and sound pollution, students have become members of libraries. Sobha, who runs Shrutam 24x7 library in Srinagar in Dharwad, as well as many students, are of the opinion that these libraries are the best places to study to face competitive exams. As a result, there is a huge demand for 24X7 libraries in the city. KSRP personnel Yallappa Shilavant from Bagalkot said, “A 24x7 library has helped me to crack the written test and get a job in the KSRP. Every aspirant wanting to ace competitive exams should make use of it.” Civil police personnel Rekha C from Yadagir said, “Studying at home or other places will not help much, but studying in 24X7 libraries will motivate us to read for long hours in order to crack competitive exams.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/dharwad-a-hub-of-24x7-libraries/articleshow/86047828.cms||---

Less than a day after Rane announced in New Delhi that the Chipi airport will be formally inaugurated on October 9 and stated that “it is not necessary that the chief minister be present for the inauguration”, state industry minister Subhash Desai held a press conference here and announced that the airport inauguration will be held on October 9 and the chief minister will be present on the occasion. The BJP once again distanced itself from Rane’s comment. BJP MLA Ashish Shelar said: “The chief minister must be given respect and he must be there for the inauguration.” A day earlier, Shiv Sena MP from Sindhdurg Vinayak Raut had tweeted the airport would be inaugurated on October 9. While Rane said Scindia will inaugurate the airport, Desai said both Thackeray and Scindia will be at the inauguration. Rane said he would come along with Scindia to Mumbai and fly out to Sindhdurg for the function. This will also be the first time that Thackeray and Rane will be present at the same function after the latter was arrested for his “slap CM” remark. Throughout his Jan Aashirwad campaign, Rane had focused his criticism entirely on Thackeray. While Rane said it was through his efforts that the Rs 520 crore airport was developed, Desai said it was the work of the MIDC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbairane-says-cm-not-needed-at-airport-launch-in-sindhudurg/articleshow/86052065.cms||---

The study stresses the need for timely detection of co-infections and prompt intervention for better treatment result in infected children. They will require more intense treatment, longer hospital stay and are at a higher mortality risk. Titled ‘Covid-19 and co-infections in Children: The Indian perspectives’, the study was conducted on 286 children admitted to MCH with Covid. Aged one month to 12 years, they were treated between June and December 2020. The study, published in Journal of Tropical Paediatrics, Oxford University Press, found 20.6% of the surveyed kids had moderate to severe disease. Forty-three of them or 15% had co-infections, testing positive to blood culture, respiratory secretion. As many as 62.8% with co-infections required PICU treatment, compared to 35.6% kids without co-infections needing intensive care. Incidence of shock, convulsion and altered sensorium were found much higher in kids with co-infections. Disease severity, overall co-morbidity, malignancy, longer PICU stay and a high death rate of 9.3% were found among them. “Detection of co-infections early and prompt treatment are important,” said MCH assistant professor of paediatrics Dibyendu Raychaudhuri. The co-authors are doctors Mihira Sarkar, Rakesh Mondal, Kalpana Datta, Aniket Roy and Debapriya Roy of MCH, pharmacology professor Avijit Hazra of IPGMER and Tapati Sengupta of WBSU.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/co-infections-more-risky-for-cov-kids/articleshow/86050150.cms||Sumati Yengkhom
---||Dehradun||Amidst possible ‘ghar-vapsi’ speculations, BJP MLA who had quit Congress in 2016 denies any move of going back||Dehradun: Raipur MLA Umesh Sharma Kau, who had previously hinted at a possible return to Congress before the forthcoming elections, on Wednesday, denied any plans of quitting the BJP. Speaking to TOI, Kau said, “I have spoken with senior party leaders and told them about my concerns. There are a few local leaders in my constituency who are constantly conspiring against me. I have been told by seniors that they will act on the matter within 15 days. I would like to reiterate that I have no plans of leaving the BJP.” Kau had joined the BJP before the 2017 assembly elections along with other Congressmen like Harak Singh Rawat, Subodh Uniyal and Yashpal Arya — all of them are currently ministers. The MLA has, of late, been voicing his dissatisfaction with certain sections of the ruling party, especially with former CM Trivendra Singh Rawat, who has been attempting to shift his political base from Doiwala to Raipur. A couple of days ago, the MLA had a public showdown with some of the BJP workers at an event in front of health minister Dhan Singh Rawat, leading to speculations about his exit from the saffron party. “As of now, I have requested the party that out of the total three, I should have at least two mandal adhyaksh of my choice in my constituency. I am sure the party will address my concerns,” Umesh Sharma Kau told TOI. Kau has a long political career. He started as a pradhan and in 2012, he became a member of the state legislative assembly by defeating BJP candidate Trivendra Singh Rawat from the Raipur constituency of Dehradun. In 2017, he retained the constituency and recorded the biggest victory margin in Uttarakhand. When contacted, tourism minister Satpal Maharaj, who was among the first to leave Congress and join the BJP before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, told TOI, “Kau is a senior member and if he has some issues, the party needs to look into it and a legislator needs to be given due respect. I will raise the issue with the party high command.” He, however, trashed the speculations of Kau’s return to Congress or joining any other political outfit. “The matter will be sorted out mutually,” said the senior minister. Meanwhile, Opposition Congress maintained that it has kept the doors open for rebels planning a “ghar vapsi”. Congress state chief Ganesh Godiyal maintained, “They willingly left the party and if they want to return, we will look into the matter. The party seniors will look into merits and demerits in each case separately and then take a call.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/amidst-possible-ghar-vapsi-speculations-bjp-mla-who-had-quit-congress-in-2016-denies-any-move-of-going-back/articleshow/86045686.cms||Gaurav Talwar

Vijayaraghavan told the media in Malappuram on Wednesday that it was the policy of the government to promote the cooperative sector. “The chief minister has made it clear that if at all there are any shortcomings in the cooperative sector, then the state has its own mechanisms in place to examine it. I need not tell anything more than what the CM has said,” he said. It is leant that CPM has conveyed the party’s displeasure to Jaleel over raising the demand, which it feels would lead to ED meddling with the cooperative sector, especially when Centre was trying to intervene in the sector which has been a preserve of state governments. Jaleel had also levelled serious financial charges against IUML leader PK Kunhalikutty saying that he was linked to the alleged Rs 1,021 crore scam in the bank. Meanwhile, Jaleel said in a Facebook post that he will continue his fight against Kunhalikutty’s alleged black money and hawala dealings and amassment of illicit wealth. He added that the chief minister was a fatherly figure who had the right to criticize, advise and correct him. “I have not earned even a single penny through corruption and have not been a party to hawala deals. I don’t even owe money to anyone even by way of loans and also don’t have any illegal investment anywhere in the world. So I will continue the fight against Kunhalikutty who has criminalized League politics and against his black money and hawala dealings and illicit amassment of wealth till my last breath,” he said. Meanwhile, BJP state president K Surendran said CM’s stand that ED shouldn’t investigate the black money in AR Nagar Bank is proof of the unholy nexus between CPM and IUML which has been going on for years. He said the links between Vijayan and Kunhalikutty faction made the CM disown Jaleel. Jaleel to appear before ED todayMeanwhile, Jaleel will appear before ED on Thursday to hand over ‘evidence’ in connection with the agency’s probe into the alleged transactions of unaccounted money through the bank account of Chandrika, the mouthpiece of IUML. Sources close to Jaleel said he was appearing before ED as per the notice issued by the agency. Jaleel had appeared before ED in Kochi to give evidence and statements related to money dealings connected to Chandrika daily. ED is probing the allegations of money laundering through the bank account of the newspaper during the time of demonetisation.

Meghwal’s September 4 letter had levelled serious charges against former Rajsamand MLA Kiran Maheshwari of hatching conspiracies, corrupt practices and promoting personal rivalry at the cost of the party. The letter leaked in the media on September 7 forced the party high command to send an emissary (Singh) from Delhi to save the party from embarrassment. Meghwal was called for a meeting at the BJP headquarters at 5pm by Poonia and Singh to convince him not to raise the issue further. Soon after the meeting, Meghwal announce, “I will not raise the issue further. I will work with the party to raise the failures of the ruling party in the assembly.” He didn’t disclose what assurance he was given by the state in-charge who came for the purpose. Earlier in the day, Meghwal was undeterred of taking up the issue at a meeting to be held at the party office at 9am on Thursday. He took a dig at dig at Poonia who refused to have received the letter sent by him on September 4. “I sent the letter via speed post which has the fastest delivery. I am sure letter must have received by Poonia,” Meghwal told TOI. Kataria has maintained his silence on the letter since it was leaked in the media on Tuesday evening. Sources said he was aware of it since it was sent to BJP national president JP Nadda and Poonia on September 4. He has neither denied nor countered the contents of the 11-page letter. “Whatever party will decide (on letter), I will accept without any question,” Kataria told TOI. Newly elected MLA from Rajsamand Deepti Maheshwari, who is a daughter of former MLA Rajsamand Kiran Maheshwari, admitted to having read the letter but refused to comment on it. Major portion of the letter contains Kataria’s repeated attempts to disrespect and malign the image of Maheshwari.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/meghwals-u-turn-on-censure-motion-against-kataria/articleshow/86052040.cms||---

Two others of the same family are still in private hospitals. A team from the malaria control department visited the town on Wednesday, and said that they are studying the cause of fever. According to reports, a 40-year-old woman with fever, her 14-year-old daughter, and two minor sons were admitted to different hospitals in Roorkee. The woman, in critical condition, was shifted to AIIMS Rishikesh for treatment. She succumbed on Sunday. Her 12-year-old son died the next day. Piran Kaliyar, a small town of 20,000 population, is famous for its Sufi shrine. The town does not have adequate arrangements for sanitation and in the rainy season heaps of garbage and waterlogging make it prone to health risks, said locals. "Near the house of my late sister, there is a heap of garbage on a plot with waterlogged pits," the deceased woman's family member said. District malaria officer Dr Gurunam Singh said, "We are collecting blood samples to ascertain the cause of fever. It is yet to be established whether malaria was the cause of the two deaths.

Our team inquired into it and identified that the boy’s stepmother never came to his rescue. Besides, the boy was given the responsibility of household chores and taking care of his year-old stepbrother.

In case the stepmother is also found involved, the boy will be sent to a childcare institution.”Inspector Parmod Kumar said, “We are verifying the role of the boy’s stepmother.

Talking to mediapersons in Alwar, Sharma said Meghwal was being treated the way he was treated for raising concerns in the interest of the party. “The internal democracy in the party has ended and it is being run by selected few leaders with no experience. They are acting like dictators in the party by dropping senior leaders who have experience of running it,” said Sharma. He supported Meghwal for having the courage to raise the issues hampering the growth of the party. “Kataria’s statement disrespecting Lord Ram and Maharana Pratap is condemnable. Meghwal did the right thing by taking it up with the national leadership,” said Sharma, who feels that it the situation will not improve will cost the party dearly in the assembly elections in the five states.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/suspended-neta-backs-bjp-leader-on-letter-issue/articleshow/86052070.cms||---
---||Thiruvananthapuram||No one should invite ED to probe co-op banks: Vasavan||Thiruvananthapuram: A day after chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan criticized MLA K T Jaleel for seeking ED probe into the alleged financial frauds at Malappuram A R Nagar Cooperative Bank, cooperation minister V N Vasavan here on Wednesday said the state government will not let anyone use the government machinery for settling personal scores against their opponents. “We can’t now say for certain about whether irregularities happend at A R Nagar Bank or not. Investigation report is yet to be received. If at all there are any irregularities in the functioning of the bank, the state government has a robust mechanism to act against such aberrations,” Vasavan said. Jaleel had approached ED, seeking action against IUML leader P K Kunhalikutty and his son Ashique for financial fraud to the tune of Rs 1,021 cr using the cooperative bank as a cover. The minister, who said he fully endorsed the opinion expressed by the chief minister, added that the government could take decisions based on the merit of issues that come before it. “Only Jaleel can say what has transpired between him and ED. Government has never used its machinery to settle personal scores against anyone. Nor will it allow anybody to misuse it,” said the minister. Responding to a question, the minister said it was up to Jaleel to examine whether it was proper to raise such allegations against a cooperative bank when the sector is faced with widespread rumours against it. Income tax department had searched the bank and they had sought the help of the joint registrar for the search. All assistance was given to the income tax then. “Following allegations that came up in the assembly, the government ordered an inquiry. However, Jaleel had not brought to the government’s attention the allegations he raised in a recent news conference. The stand that invites ED to conduct a probe into the cooperative sector is not proper. CM had clarified the government stand unequivocally. I have nothing more to add,” said Vasavan. The minister said the government was committed to act against any sort of irregularities in the cooperative sector. He pointed out the government action in the Karuvannur Cooperative Bank as an example for the government’s commitment. In the case of AR Nagar Cooperative Bank, the report by the joint registrar would be available only after some time as the allegations were about transactions in a 10-year duration. “Based on the report, action would be taken. Further investigation would be conducted, if required,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/no-one-should-invite-ed-to-probe-co-op-banks-vasavan/articleshow/86050275.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

---||Dehradun||U’khand HC notice to FB, Centre after lawyer says his morphed videos posted online||Dehradun: The Uttarakhand high court on Wednesday issued notices to Facebook, the state government and the Centre after a lawyer who practises at the high court in Nainital said in his plea that he has been a victim of online abuse and that despite a rise in such cases, there was “no institutional framework to deal with it”. The special division bench of Chief Justice RS Chauhan and justice A K Verma while hearing the petition filed by advocate Alok Kumar was told in court that criminals first tried to extort money from him and then put his morphed, obscene videos online. Kumar in his petition said, “It started after I accepted a friend request from a stranger on Facebook in July, thinking it could be a potential client. I received a video call from the profile, which I picked up. I saw a woman on the other end indulging in obscene acts. Despite disconnecting the call immediately, my footage was used to create a morphed video which was inappropriate.” The petition added that Kumar, a resident of Haridwar, was threatened that the video would be made public unless he paid Rs 5,000. Kumar filed a police complaint, but the video eventually made its way online. “It significantly tarnished my reputation,” he said. Kumar complained to Facebook and law enforcement agencies several times and the fraudster’s profile was eventually taken down. He added: “There is complete lack of regulation of the online space, which is injuring people’s reputation, privacy, their physical and mental wellbeing across the world, but particularly so in India and also in Uttarakhand.” His plea said there is “lack of regulation and the necessary enabling legal framework, leading to an extreme spike in the number of cases of online abuse, online hacking and others”. The court then issued a notice to Facebook, Uttarakhand police, the state government, the Centre and ordered them to file their responses within three weeks. In January this year, Delhi Police had busted a gang of conmen who created fake social media profiles and after getting the victim on a video call, captured their footage and edited it into obscene content. It would then be used to extort money. The gang had conned over 40 people.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/ukhand-hc-notice-to-fb-centre-after-lawyer-says-his-morphed-videos-posted-online/articleshow/86045814.cms||Mohammad Anab

---||Mumbai||First integrated township in Mumbai to be built on Mhada plot||MUMBAI: The first-ever integrated township in the city will be built on a 143-acre Mhada layout, the path for which was cleared by the state cabinet when it approved the Rs 20,000-crore redevelopment plan for Motilal Nagar in Goregaon (west) on Wednesday. Housing minister Jitendra Awhad said 33,000 new flats will be constructed, adding the redevelopment will be carried out in four phases over 10 years. It will serve as a model for the redevelopment of other Mhada layouts in the city. Motilal Nagar, the largest layout in the city, was built in 1960 for the economically weaker sections. It has 3,700 tenements, which are ground-plus-one structures, and is also home to 1,600 slumdwellers. Motilal Ngr will be rebuilt on contract basis: AwhadThe city will see its first integrated township come up at Motilal Nagar in Goregaon (West) when it is redeveloped by Mhada. The green signal for the project was given by the cabinet on Wednesday. Motilal Nagar is a Mhada layout spread over 143 acres. Mhada has large layouts in various parts of the city. Many have seen neglect at the hands of Mhada and the government, resulting in large-scale encroachments on its open spaces by residents and political parties. The cabinet approval for the Motilal Nagar plan was needed as the government has now taken over the powers from Mhada to approve all redevelopment in its layouts. Many redevelopment projects have been languishing for years and residents whose homes were demolished have been living elsewhere without getting rent. While the government received several complaints about it, it could not intervene as there is no tripartite agreement with Mhada. The state housing department recently issued a government resolution that it will be the final authority for issuance of letter of intent for any redevelopment so as to keep a check on matters and ensure speedy redevelopment. Awhad said Motilal Nagar will be redeveloped on a contract and development basis, wherein Mhada will appoint a developer who will invest the money and the profits will be shared. Asked about the redevelopment scam at Patra chawl, which Mhada after 22 years will now be redeveloping on its own, Awhad said: “In case of Patra chawl it was a consent agreement. In this case it is a contract and development agreement. We shall ensure the government does not lose out.” Mhada layouts are permitted a floor space index (FSI) of 4 besides fungible FSI, which is 35% of the built-up area and given free of premium for the rehabilitation component. Mhada has appointed a consortium of Sandeep Shirke and Associates and P K Das and Associates to prepare the master plan. Das, an architect, town planner and activist, said: “The integrated township will comprise affordable housing, affordable workplaces, all open spaces as designated in the Development Plan will be provided along with schools, markets, parking lot, commercial buildings, et cetera.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/motilal-ngr-will-be-rebuilt-on-contract-basis-in-mumbai-awhad/articleshow/86052585.cms||Clara Lewis

---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Congress takes swipe at BJP on internal feud||JAIPUR: A day after senior BJP MLA Kailash Meghwal targeted Opposition leader Gulab Chand Kataria ahead of the assembly session, the ruling Congress on Wednesday targeted the Opposition party by describing it as an undisciplined party with half a dozen leaders vying for chief ministership. Commenting on Meghwal’s letter to BJP national president J P Nadda against Kataria, transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas said the questions raised by the BJP MLA were pertinent. Joining the issue, health minister Raghu Sharma said the infighting in the opposition party has exposed that it is an ‘indisciplined’ party. “There are six CM candidates in BJP. The party recently took out ‘Jan Ashirwad Yatra’ but for what are they the seeking blessings?” Sharma asked. He said that despite considerable decline in revenue, Ashok Gehlot-led government did not let development work suffer during the Covid pandemic. Meghwal wrote to BJP chief Nadda that Kataria has become a liability to the saffron party with his comments on Maharana Pratap and Lord Ram that caused losses to the party during the assembly by-elections. During campaigning for the bypolls in Rajsamand in April, Kataria stoked controversy by making derogatory remarks regarding Maharana Pratap, triggering widespread criticism. Around the same time, he also said that without BJP, 'Shri Ram' would have been in the sea. He had also alleged financial misappropriation by Kataria. MLA Meghwal informed party's state president Satish Poonia through a letter that he would move a censure motion against Kataria in the party's legislative meeting ahead of the assembly session, which will start on Thursday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/cong-takes-swipe-at-bjp-on-internal-feud/articleshow/86052082.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Assembly session begins today, likely to be stormy||JAIPUR: The assembly session beginning on Thursday is likely to be stormy. The Opposition would raise the issue of the session being convened as a continuation of the Budget session without proroguing the last session. The BJP had already accused the ruling party of infringing upon the powers of the governor to convene the assembly session as the state government had not issued the order proroguing the last budget session. Fresh session of the assembly is being convened by the governor. The Opposition might corner the government on the increasing incidents of crime especially with broad daylight shooting incidents happened in the state capital. They could also beat the ruling party on power crisis due to shortage of coal and on the farmers plight after monsoon failure. The just concluded panchayat election and the cross voting and the accusations within the ruling party of targeting the Sachin Pilot faction for the party set back in the Jaipur zilla pramukh election likely to be exploited by the Opposition. The accusations had revived the factional feud within the ruling party. The discontentment in the ruling party MLAs over the inordinate delay in the cabinet expansion and political appointments also exploited by the opposition. The ruling party also take advantage of the renewed factional fight within the BJP with the fresh allegations against the Opposition leader Gulab Chand Kataria by a senior leader Kailash Meghwal. Meghwal is seen acting at the behest of former chief minister Vasundhara Raje. Raje and the official faction have been taking swipes at each other over Raje's aerial visit to the flood affected areas and removal of pictures of the former chief minister from party posters.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/assembly-session-begins-today-likely-to-be-stormy/articleshow/86052078.cms||---
---||Navi-mumbai||Maharashtra: Chaggan Bhujbal son, nephew and 2 others discharged in Rs 44 crore cheating case||MUMBAI: A special court on Wednesday discharged cabinet minister Chaggan Bhujbal’s son Pankaj Bhujbal, nephew Sameer Bhujbal and two others in a case of cheating. The four were accused of cheating flat buyers in a Navi Mumbai development project called “Hexworld”. It was alleged that 2,344 flats were sold and Rs 44 crore was collected from purchasers but the project was far from completion. The Bhujbals and two others — Rajesh Dharap and Satyen Kesarkar — who were directors of M/s Devisha Infrastructure Private Limited (DIPL), were discharged from offences relating to cheating, criminal breach of trust and criminal conspiracy under the IPC, and also under provisions of the Maharashtra Ownership Flats Act. The court, however, said that the case will proceed against the fifth accused. The case will come up for hearing on October 7. Defence advocate Sajal Yadav sought discharge of the accused from the case on the grounds that DIPL had returned the money of more than 200 flat purchasers who requested for return of the booking amount. The defence argued that administrative delays had hamstrung the project, therefore, demanding remaining amount from the flat purchasers or raising funds from investors to complete the project was not possible. Yadav also submitted that the land was subsequently attached and the default was for reasons beyond one’s control and there was no culpable intention. A flat buyer, Mohammad Shaikh, filed a complaint with the Economic Offences Wing of the Taloja police station on June 13, 2015, in connection with the flats booked by his wife and him. It was alleged that the directors hatched a conspiracy and projected that they will develop project “Hexworld” on 25 acres of land in Sector 35, Kharghar. It was further alleged that they did this knowing well that DIPL neither had any land in its name nor construction-related permission. They did not even have possession of any land. It was alleged that they misrepresented potential flat buyers by concealing these facts with a view to cheat them. The investigating agency had further alleged that possession of the flats was not given to the complainant within three years from the date of booking. Besides, construction work had been completed only up to the stage of plinth and no further development had been made. It was claimed that only letter of intent (LoI) was given to flat purchasers and that the sale proceeds were deposited in a designated account but not used for construction and instead siphoned off for personal use. The defence, however, contended that the entire case of the prosecution was baseless. The court’s reasoned order is yet to be made available.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/mumbai-bhujbal-son-nephew-and-2-others-discharged-in-rs-44cr-cheating-case/articleshow/86058554.cms||Rebecca Samervel
---||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Chaggan Bhujbal son, nephew and 2 others discharged in Rs 44 crore cheating case||MUMBAI: A special court on Wednesday discharged cabinet minister Chaggan Bhujbal’s son Pankaj Bhujbal, nephew Sameer Bhujbal and two others in a case of cheating. The four were accused of cheating flat buyers in a Navi Mumbai development project called “Hexworld”. It was alleged that 2,344 flats were sold and Rs 44 crore was collected from purchasers but the project was far from completion. The Bhujbals and two others — Rajesh Dharap and Satyen Kesarkar — who were directors of M/s Devisha Infrastructure Private Limited (DIPL), were discharged from offences relating to cheating, criminal breach of trust and criminal conspiracy under the IPC, and also under provisions of the Maharashtra Ownership Flats Act. The court, however, said that the case will proceed against the fifth accused. The case will come up for hearing on October 7. Defence advocate Sajal Yadav sought discharge of the accused from the case on the grounds that DIPL had returned the money of more than 200 flat purchasers who requested for return of the booking amount. The defence argued that administrative delays had hamstrung the project, therefore, demanding remaining amount from the flat purchasers or raising funds from investors to complete the project was not possible. Yadav also submitted that the land was subsequently attached and the default was for reasons beyond one’s control and there was no culpable intention. A flat buyer, Mohammad Shaikh, filed a complaint with the Economic Offences Wing of the Taloja police station on June 13, 2015, in connection with the flats booked by his wife and him.

---||Delhi||Manual scavenging death: Delhi cops draw court ire||NEW DELHI: A city court has pulled up Delhi Police for its “callousness” and “carelessness” in a case related to the death of a man allegedly due to manual scavenging after no report was filed about the status of the investigation for over five months despite repeated orders. Additional Sessions Judge Ravinder Bedi sought a compliance report from the ACP concerned by September 18. The FIR was registered on the statement of Monu, a safai karamchari, who said the accused, Shanky and Anil Giri, allegedly contacted him and his companions, Ravi, Sanjay and Deepak, asking them to come the next day to clean the CBD ground sewer. On February 2, 2020, when they reached the ground and opened the lid, a foul smell prevented them from entering the sewer without protective gear. However, both the accused contractors remained adamant that they enter the pit, the FIR alleged. It was further alleged that Ravi choked to death after entering the sewer under compulsion and Sanjay had to undergo treatment as he had entered to pull Ravi out. The ASJ noted that further investigation with respect to the then joint engineer in Delhi Development Authority (DDA) and others was pending. On December 11 last year, the investigating officer (IO) had sought some more time to investigate their roles. On January 19, 2021, the IO again stated that the authority was not responding to various notices sent by police. On March 2, 2021, the IO again stated non-cooperation on part of the department concerned, where the accused were employed, and requested for an adjournment and time to file a supplementary challan. “This court observes that despite these orders since March 2 until August 11, 2021, no status report has been filed by the IO, nor has he turned up. The callousness and carelessness of the investigating agency is writ large,” the order stated. It further said it was constrained to call the DCP concerned to file a detailed compliance report of the previous, along with the supplementary challan. The status report filed did not indicate the steps taken during further investigation after January 19, 2021. “The ACP concerned, who is connected through videoconferencing, seeks some more time to investigate the role... along with others and ensures will comply with the previous orders of the court and to file a detailed report/supplementary challan preferably on or before September 18,” the court noted. The case was registered under IPC sections 304A (causing death by negligence), 34 (common intention) and under sections of Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 and SC & ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/scavenging-death-cops-draw-court-ire/articleshow/86047822.cms||Usha Das
---||Madurai||DCPs to handle both law and order, crime in Madurai||Madurai: The state government has issued an order re-designating the posts of deputy commissioner of police (DCP) Law and Order and DCP Crime in Madurai city as DCP (South) and DCP (North) respectively.While DCPs were earlier exclusively in charge of law and order or crime from across city limits, soon they will be in charge of handling both law and order (L&O) and crime offences within their respective jurisdictions. The government order dated August 24 was issued by S K Prabakar, additional chief secretary to Government (Home) based on the request from the director general of police, Chennai, to re-designate posts to improve the performance of both law and order and crime wings at police stations.Also, while Tirupparankundram and High Court ranges have only one ACP, Town, Tallakulam, Thilagarthidal and Anna Nagar ranges have two ACPs each separately in charge of L&O and crime. According to the new proposal, the number of ranges has been increased to nine from six with each range having only one assistant commissioner of police (ACP) who would handle both L&O and crime offences. The nine re-designated ranges are Temple range, South Gate, Tirupparankundram, Avaniyapuram, Palanganatham, Karimedu, Tallakulam, Sellur and Anna Nagar range. Fewer police stations would be brought under the re-designated ranges.Police sources said that the re-designations and re-allocation of jurisdictions will be beneficial. “While some officials are swamped with work, others may have less work burden. But, this re-designation will help divide the work load better and also improve co-ordination between those handling law and order and crime offences. With nine ranges now, ACPs can also be more focused on territorial basis. In case of DCPs, now with them being allocated territories, it will help them improve functioning,” said a senior police official.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/dcps-to-handle-both-law-and-order-crime-in-madurai/articleshow/86050334.cms||---
---||Jaipur||‘Emergency landing facility on highway a force multiplier’||JAIPUR: As Barmer prepares for the inauguration of the 3km-long emergency landing facility (ELF) on National Highway-925A on Thursday, Indian Airforce officers called this facility a “force multiplier, which would prove to be a strategic boost to the Western sector and an effective backup runaway for a war like situation.” While IAF has landed aircraft on national highways previously, including the Yamuna Expressway, this is the first time that NHAI has developed a strip keeping in mind the requirement for a landing facility on which transporter aircraft will also be able to land for the first time on a NH, apart from fighter jets. Defence minister Rajnath Singh and minister for road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari will inaugurate the ELF. Officials claimed that this runway also comes at a time when India is prepared for infiltration from Afghanistan via Pakistan. NHAI had developed a 3km section of Satta-Gandhav stretch of NH-925A which is part of the newly-developed two-lane paved shoulder of Gagariya-Bakhasar and Satta-Gandhav section. It is 196.97km long and was built at a cost of Rs 765.52 crore under the Bharatmala Pariyojana. Talking about the significance of this landing strip, a serving Wing Commander said, “In the 1971 war, the Pathankot air base landing strip was bombed heavily and there was no back up runway, but this type of facility becomes crucial in such a scenario. This new way of landing on highways is being done globally and works in an economically effective manner as it serves dual purpose in the same cost.” Apart from the ELF, three helipads have been constructed in Kundanpura, Singhania and Bakhasar villages, which will be the basis for strengthening the defence forces and security network on the western international border of the country. The ELF was constructed in a time span of 19 months.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/emergency-landing-facility-on-highway-a-force-multiplier/articleshow/86052095.cms||Yeshika Budhwar
---||Madurai||From Paramakudi with love: CM’s image woven into sari||Madurai: A weaver in Paramakudi has woven the image of chief minister M K Stalin in a handloom sari in gratitude for his suggestion that government employees should wear handloom clothes twice a week in the interest of the weaving community. ``It would be a livelihood support to weavers throughout the state,’’ said M K Saravanan, 46, who took the help of his assistant and a designer to make the sari. Saravanan, who belongs to the Pasumpon weavers society, spun the sari with the help of his assistant G N Kubendran by working continuously for five days. ``We wanted this one to be different from the previous one. So we sought the help of a designer, P Srinivasan, who helped us copy the image of the CM signing his first file after assuming office on May 7,” he said. It took them a few days to master this task as the image did not set properly on the frame. “We also wanted to highlight late CM M Karunanidhi’s photograph on the side into a 3D image,’’ he said.They tried weaving the image using a jacquard machine with 480 hooks. Their normal jacquard machine has 120 or for more finer works, they use 240 hooks. They tried out three different saris of which the best quality 80s compact combed cotton was used for the last one. “That’s why the image looks so realistic,” he said. There are 85 weavers cooperative societies in Paramakudi region. Saravanan said they had broached the idea about making the sari to assistant director for handlooms and textiles S Chandrasekaran, and handloom officer R Mohana who welcomed the move. Earlier, they had woven the image of Mahakavi Bharathiar, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and of him with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping when he visited Mahabalipuram.Handloom officer R Mohana says they used 11 different colours of thread to make the image look real. This was the highlight of this sari compared to the others woven by weavers in the region. The image of Karunanidhi in his yellow shawl has been woven with a 3D effect. ``If you stand on the right side or left side of the sari and look at it, you will feel as if Kalaignar is looking at you,’’ said Saravanan. One of the saris has been sent to handloom and textiles minister R Gandhi while another is on its way to Chennai and the other on display at Paramakudi. This 100% handloom sari would cost about Rs 15,000 due to the effort which went into it. A normal handloom sari can be woven in less than two days, said Saravanan.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/from-paramakudi-with-love-cms-image-woven-into-sari/articleshow/86050325.cms||---

They pay a rent of Rs 5,000 to the landowner for their tents and have to pay electricity charges and buy water and basic amenities. So the relief is a much needed support, she said.Her daughters, Kavitha, Gemini and Jumli who are also married to men from Ahamedabad or neighbouring places, also live with their parents. All of them depend on the sale of idols for living. There are twelve such families in the area who sell idols for a living. “Even during the two lockdowns, we got groceries and other help, but never got financial aid. We do not know whether we will get this relief amount, but it would be great if we could sell the idols that we have made,” said Meena.Now, more than twenty 10-feet Ganesha idols that she has made with plaster of paris can only be dumped as they cannot be sold due to the restriction on size. The small colony now has hundreds of small idols to be sold.M Ramalingam, an idol maker from Vilacheri, says that they are not sure whether they would benefit from the relief announced by the chief minister. “This may be for the potters, who already get a monsoon relief of Rs 5,000. It would be better if we got to sell our idols in select places, and a representation to this effect has been made to Madurai district collector Dr S Aneesh Sekhar,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/idol-makers-unsure-if-rs-5k-enough-to-bring-relief/articleshow/86050310.cms||---

The festival, celebrated with much fervour and joy here, usually witnesses large processions and crowds. However, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and with the state government restricting the festival just to rituals, the celebrations will be low key this year as well. Even celebrations at home will be a subdued affair. “We have been celebrating Ganesh Chaturthi for the past 52 years at home. All our friends and extended families would join us for a day of celebrations. However, due to Covid-19, only our family members will take part in the festivities this year, like last year,” said Vikram Kamath, a resident of Balmatta. In Dakshina Kannada where Ganeshotsava is celebrated with pomp, the pandemic has been a dampner. The Dakshina Kannada district administration had directed organisers to hold Ganeshotsava symbolically. There is no permission for pandals at public places and celebrations are only allowed inside temples, halls and homes, with a limited number of devotees. The family of late Mohan Rao in Mannagudda, who have been making Ganesh idols for the last 91 years, said they have made 230 idols this year. “We make idols after taking orders before-hand every year. Earlier, a few people used to take our idols abroad, but it has stopped,” said the idol makers. “There is also a demand for green or eco-friendly Ganesh idols,” said green Ganesh idol maker Vinayak Shet of Car Street, Mangaluru. Only a few people have planned to have public Ganeshotsava celebrations, and one among them will be at Sanghaniketan, which has been conducting the event for the last 75 years. Apart from it, a few bhajana mandalis and others have planned for public Ganeshotsava celebrations. Meanwhile, markets are flooded with vegetables and flowers that are must during Ganesh Chaturthi.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/coast-gears-up-for-ganesh-chaturthi-amidst-pandemic/articleshow/86045903.cms||---
---||Jaipur||Rajasthan bans public events to pre-empt possible third wave||JAIPUR: To prevent spread of Covid, the state government has banned organising social, political, sports, entertainment, cultural and religious functions, processions, fairs and haat markets till further orders. Principal secretary (home) Abhay Kumar has written to all the district collectors, commissioners of police and SPs citing the order issued on July 10, 2021, that Covid-appropriate behaviour and compliance of Covid protocol should be ensured in public places. Lack of it could lead to the third wave, he warned. He cautioned that the virus is not completely eliminated, so keeping in mind the possible third wave of Covid, it should be ensured by the administration that any kind of programmes such as picketing, demonstrations, processions, rallies should not be allowed. All the district magistrates and police commissioners have been instructed to ensure strict compliance of ‘no-mask, no-movement.’ Appropriate penal action should be taken against the violators. It cited a directive issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs of the Government of India to the state governments, instructing to impose local restrictions on the upcoming festivals and to control the crowd in public. Also, a need has been expressed to focus on a five-fold strategy (test, track, treat, vaccination and Covid-appropriate behaviour) for effective management of Covid. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the National Center for Disease Control (NCDC) have also expressed the apprehension of crowded public events turning into super-spreader events. It said in view of the reduction in Covid cases in the state, permission has been given to conduct essential activities keeping in mind the convenience of the common man and the availability of goods and services. There has been a decline in Covid cases for the last few days, but still, in some states, the daily positive cases are still increasing. In view of this, the home department has given instructions to be fully aware, take precautions and follow Covid-appropriate behaviour.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/state-bans-public-events-to-pre-empt-possible-3rd-wave/articleshow/86052099.cms||---
---||Kolkata||Pvt hosps seek billing answers||Kolkata: The Association of Hospitals of Eastern India will write to the West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission (WBCERC), seeking a justification of the comparison of a bill from Christian Medical College Vellore with that of a Kolkata corporate hospital, saying private hospitals here should take a lesson on charges from the former. The commission’s chairman on Monday had cited a gap between the charges of CMC and Fortis Hospital Kolkata, in response to a complaint lodged by a Barrackpore patient. This, it said, was the reason for Bengal patients flocking to south India for treatment. Justice (retd) Ashim Kumar Banerjee had also said the commission would send copies of the Vellore bill to all private hospitals in Bengal for them to learn from it. “We want to know from the president the basis on which a bill of a trust-run hospital and that of a corporate hospital have been compared. The comment that corporate hospitals should learn a lesson from CMC Vellore has created confusion among people. Private hospitals will meet soon and write to the commission, requesting it to explain the comment and the decision,” said AHEI president Rupak Barua. The commission’s decision on Monday was taken following a complaint by a Barrackpore resident, who was treated at Fortis for nine days for a leg injury. He had claimed Fortis charged him Rs 4.9 lakh and later, when he went to Vellore, he was billed Rs 1.2 lakh for 19 days. He went to the panel, complaining against the Fortis bill. “Apart from donation from patrons, CMC runs a huge medical college, from where it gets enormous manpower support, including doctors, nurses and paramedics, helping it to subsidize treatment,” said Barua. The commission’s bill comparison has drawn flak from some of its own members. Cardiac surgeon Kunal Sarkar wrote on social media on how could the two bills be compared. “I would not want to comment further. This was not my personal opinion but a decision by the commission,” said Banerjee on Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/pvt-hosps-seek-billing-answers/articleshow/86050358.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

---||Mumbai||After commuters fume, BEST to review changes in routes||MUMBAI: The ‘rationalisation’ of bus routes across Mumbai from September 1 has not gone down well with many commuters, who are fuming over cancellation of 23 bus routes and curtailment of 45 others. Taking cognisance of their complaints and after hearing the BEST committee members who also moved “adjournment motion” at the latest meeting, the undertaking’s general manager Lokesh Chandra said this was a “serious issue concerning commuters and cannot be ignored.” TimesViewAny improvement in bus frequency is welcome, bus route changes, cancellations or curtailments need to be done diligently, and only after taking commuters into confidence. BEST also needs to improve its public awareness mechanism to educate commuters about the possible routes which can make travel faster for them. The undertaking should also have digital indicators on all buses which clearly mention the destination and a few stops en route for passengers’ convenience. It should not desist from recalling a few cancelled routes if there is a greater commuter demand.The GM said that he will call a review meeting along with BEST committee chairman Ashish Chemburkar for all revamped/cancelled routes within a month, and rectify the routes, if required, by the first week of October. The BEST, presently, caters to more than 25 lakh daily commuters. The cancelled routes have put the burden of regular commuters on other routes. Sources said this has led to crowding in buses, which is dangerous in view of the anticipated third wave of Covid-19. The government directive of “No standees allowed” is not being followed in majority of buses. This correspondent witnessed crowded buses at several places, including Mulund, Ghatkopar, Sion, Fort, Nariman Point, Worli, Bandra, Santacruz, Jogeshwari, Goregaon and Malad over the past few days. A section of the commuters has already switched to other modes such as autos and taxis so that they can travel following social distancing norms. Commuters have also complained that route indicators on buses are not clear. “Now that our regular bus routes have been scrapped, there is no one to guide us about the alternative routes. There is chaos and confusion at bus stops,” said Ankush Nalawade, a commuter. Transport expert Pranav Naik said that the BEST officials should have taken the commuters into confidence before taking such decisions. Chandra said that the cancelled routes were, in fact, “amalgamated” with other routes in order to improve frequency of buses by 10-15 minutes. “In the past, buses of two different routes would come bunched at a stop. Now, we have cancelled one route, while the other will run with more buses and better frequency,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-after-commuters-fume-best-to-review-changes-in-routes/articleshow/86052118.cms||Somit Sen

Providing details of the probe conducted so far, including findings on the roles of those in the administrative committee of the bank, the crime branch has claimed that a detailed investigation is being conducted. As per the report filed by crime branch to the court, the fraud took place with the knowledge of the members of the bank’s administrative committee from 2016 to 2021. Of the 13 members of the committee, 12 have been made accused in the case and the vice president of the committee is dead, the court was told. Crime branch’s report said the committee members misused their positions for the fraud. Sanction has been sought from the state government for proceeding against the employees and the members of the administrative committee as per Prevention of Corruption Act, crime branch said. Showing higher valuation for properties, giving fake memberships to allow loans, returning documents to those who took loans without fully repaying them, allowing people to sell mortgaged properties even as the loan remained unpaid, allowing use of fake addresses, and granting loan on landed property without the original owner’s knowledge, etc were unearthed during investigation, the high court was told.

According to the police, it was a boy who alerted them on noticing a dog carrying the head around 1 pm on Wednesday. The dog was expected to have spotted it near a dried-up and damaged sewage channel. However, the baby’s body is yet to be discovered. From the condition of the recovered head, it is suspected that the baby would have died a few days ago. Tallakulam police, along with the district child welfare committee (CWC) and other officials, inspected the spot where the head was found. It has been taken to Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) where an autopsy is to be performed. Police said the baby’s body could have been buried or dumped in garbage from where the dog picked up the head. Based on a complaint from the Bibikulam village administrative officer, Tallakulam police have registered a case. “We have also directed to look into records of primary health centres in the area for any births in the past week. We have also asked to look into records at Government Rajaji Hospital for anyone from Bibikulam locality who might have given birth and taken their child home within the past 10 days,” said L Shanmugam, district CWC member.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/babys-severed-head-recovered-from-stray-dog/articleshow/86050352.cms||---
---||Mumbai||Daily Covid cases in Mumbai surge past 500 for first time in 54 days||MUMBAI: Daily Covid cases in the city surged beyond 500 on Wednesday for the first time since July 15. Cases in Maharashtra, too, rose to 4,174, mainly due to the spurt in Mumbai and Nashik. The surge in Mumbai (532) comes after cases dropped to the year’s lowest 196 on August 17 and has triggered fears of the third wave. BMC officials, however, said the higher numbers could be the result of more people testing themselves for Covid before travelling out of town for the 10-day Ganpati festival which begins on Friday. Fatalities in the state and city continued to be low. The state recorded 65 deaths, of which four were in Mumbai. The jump in cases in the city is reflected in the fact that the number of sealed buildings has risen to 50 from 25 in early August. Adding to the panic, the BMC dashboard showed the first containment zone (in slums as against sealed buildings) since August 14. While the zone was shown to be located in R-south ward (Kandivli), ward officer Sandhya Nandedkar denied it and called it a data entry error. “We found only one case in this slum. For a containment zone, we need five or more cases,” she said. In April, the city had 2,800 containment zones.   BMC executive health officer Dr Mangala Gomare said the rise could be due to two factors: more people getting tested for Ganpati travel and easing of restrictions since August 15. “We conducted close to 50,000 tests and found 532 cases, but there is no corresponding rise in critical cases in hospitals,’’ said Gomare. At Andheri’s Seven Hills Hospital, which is the BMC’s main Covid hospital, daily admissions have risen by 2% or 3% daily. On Wednesday, 35 new patients were admitted, taking the bed occupation to 392 in the 1,500-bedded hospital. A discussion regarding the Covid situation in the state ahead of the Ganpati festival was held in the state cabinet on Wednesday. It was decided that the surge in cases should be monitored and district administrations have been asked to ramp up testing. “We have downsized the festival in a major way and are hoping that the rush will come down. The surge in cases is to be monitored closely, especially in the smaller districts,” said an official.

In Madurai district, a 50-bed Nipah ward with Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds has been kept ready at Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH).GRH dean Dr A Rathinavel said that so far no Nipah virus case has been reported in Madurai, but the preparation of the isolation ward was done as a precautionary measure. “A team of doctors are ready and will be put in place if required,” he said. In case of any suspected case, samples will be collected and sent to National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune. The treatment for the infection mainly involves supportive care. Anyone with symptoms of Nipah virus infection, which include fever, headache, muscle pain, vomiting, sore throat, dizziness, and any neurological signs that may indicate encephalitis are advised to immediately consult a doctor.Meanwhile, screening and monitoring has been intensified at border districts such as Kanyakmari, Theni and Tenkasi. “In Kanyakumari, people cross the border on a daily-basis for work to and from Kerala. So, we have instructed the primary health centre medical officers to direct village health nurses (VHNs) and Anganwadi workers to work together and identify those who travel regularly to Kerala and to watch and monitor them and their families to check whether they develop any symptoms of Nipah virus infection,” said a senior health official from the district.A Nipah virus isolation ward has also been kept ready at Kanyakumari Medical College Hospital, Asaripallam where anyone with the symptoms of Nipah will be isolated. Samples will also be collected from them and sent to the National Institute of Virology, Pune. At the check posts in the district, screening is being done for all those who come from Kerala.Further, the animal husbandry department is also to monitor pigs, which can develop Nipah virus symptoms and any infestation of fruit bats.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/nipah-isolation-ward-set-up-at-grh-in-madurai/articleshow/86050377.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Delhi||2-year deadline to revive Delhi’s 22 key lakes, 200 waterbodies||NEW DELHI: Satyendar Jain, Delhi water minister and Delhi Jal Board chairman, chaired a meeting on the revival and rejuvenation of water bodies in the city on Thursday and set a deadline of two years to revive 22 key lakes and 200 waterbodies in the capital. Jain said the different aspects of reviving each waterbody has been studied. The lakes are to be developed into landscaped tourist spots and will be fed year-round with water from existing or new sewage treatment plants. “The lakes should have clean water throughout the year. It must be ensured that maximum groundwater is recharged through these waterbodies,” Jain told the meeting. “Sludge and solid waste should be cleaned and the ecosystem rejuvenated. The lakes should be developed as public spaces with proper landscaping.” Jain added, “The landscaping should transform the sites in such a way that they attract attention and find a place on the maps of every tourist across the world.” To expedite work, Jain bifurcated the responsibilities between Delhi government’s two engineering departments.  In addition, DJB will ensure that the waterbodies receive recycled water throughout the year from STPs even as the irrigation & flood control department will work on the landscaping. In the meeting, Jain also instructed the officials to create additional recharge wells near waterbodies and lakes to increase their water-recharging capacities. He further directed them to see that drains carrying clean rainwater were connected to nearby ponds and lakes. Some of the key waterbodies among the 22 that are set to be rejuvenated include the Hauz Khas Lake, Sanjay Lake in east Delhi, Roshanara Lake, Bhalswa Lake, Timarpur Oxidation Lake and Rohini Lake, the last two having been designated as key projects by the DJB chairman. “The rejuvenation of Timarpur Oxidation Lake and Rohini Lake are two of our most important projects. These lakes should be restored as per expectations and the officials should work hard to make the plan yield the planned results,” said Jain. While the Timarpur waterbody is spread across 38 acres, the Rohini Lake occupies a space of 40 acres. DJB is already working on reviving 45 waterbodies, and the work is expected to be completed by the end of the year. These ponds were largely dealing with the direct sewage inflow from nearby areas. Officials said that to tackle this problem, decentralised sewage treatment plants are being installed for site-specific treatment of wastewater.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/2-yr-deadline-to-revive-delhis-22-key-lakes-200-waterbodies/articleshow/86080579.cms||Jasjeev Gandhiok

At least 25 locations where child begging is prominent have been identified to be focussed on. Identification of child beggars, surveillance and monitoring of areas where child begging is prominent, rescue and rehabilitation of child beggars were discussed. In 2019, twenty child beggars were rescued in Madurai while in 2020, the number was 12 and this year, eight have been rescued so far. As many as 25 locations have been identified as being prone to child begging. They include Meenakshi Amman Temple, Thirupparankundram Temple, Alagarkovil, St Mary’s Church, Goripalayam Mosque, and other similar places of worship, district court, Madurai railway junction, Mattuthavani bus stand, Arapalayam bus stand, Vilakkuthoon, Teppakulam, Melamadai Signal, Bypass Road Signal, Kalavasal Signal, Periyar, railway bridges, KK Nagar Park and vegetable markets among others.

While usually police along with other departments rescue child beggars and hand them over to CWC, for the past few months, no child begging case has been registered. Hence, steps are to be taken to reduce child begging,” said CWC member Shanumugam. The different departments are set to work together to identify and rescue child beggars by visiting and monitoring the 25 known locations. If anyone in Madurai comes across any child found begging on streets, Madurai district CWC members can be contacted: Dr V M Vijaya Shanmugam – 9786615915, L Shanmugam – 9842162762, M R Shanthi – 9442843937, B Pandiaraja – 8608196393.

The unit that was originally part of Kerala Electricals and Allied Engineering Company that was functioning since 1990 was handed over to BHEL in 2010. While 51% shares were with BHEL, the remaining 49% was retained by the state government. The unit that was originally manufacturing power car alternator, train lighting alternator and diesel generator setting, has since then been functioning as a joint venture initiative, with a plan to diversify into other segments. However, the idea could not be materialized and it began posting losses continuously since 2010. When the Centre clarified its policy of disinvesting the public sector, the unit also began staring at privatization and that is when the state government decided to step in. The state government decided to invest Rs 77 crore, including Rs 34 crore arrears made by the unit and Rs 43 crore required for rejuvenating the unit. This also includes Rs 14 crore in salary arrears to employees. The state government decided to retain the unit as a model unit in the public sector by modernizing the production unit that will manufacture traction motors, controllers, alternators, street light controllers, etc. In an online function on Wednesday, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan announced the takeover of the unit. Industries minister P Rajeeve said that the state government intends to take the state to industrial growth by modernizing and protecting the public sector. tnn||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/state-assumes-control-of-bhels-kasaragod-arm/articleshow/86050435.cms||---
---||Kochi||Neelakurinji title deeds: CPM leader resigns party post||Idukki: The settlement issues of the proposed Neelakurinji sanctuary in Vattavada in Idukki is emerging as a major headache for the government and CPM in Idukki. Former Vattavada panchayat president and CPM leader P Ramraj resigned the party area and branch committee member posts after the statement by the party district secretariat member. In a meeting, Ramraj said that the government’s failure to solve the Neelakurinji issue led to the decreasing number of votes for party candidate and Devikulam MLA A Raja in the last assembly election. But the district secretariat member said that there were encroachers in the Neelakurinji sanctuary area. Following this, Ramaraj resigned from the area committee member post. Ramaraj told TOI that presently, he has not resigned from the party membership, but the settlement issue in the Neelakurinji sanctuary area is not yet solved. “From 2006, the party leadership and the government agreed that they would take steps to separate the human living areas and forest areas in the proposed Neelakurinji sanctuary in Vattavada. In December 2017, a three-member ministerial committee visited Vattavada and agreed to solve the issue. But after four years, the issue is still in red tape,” said Ramaraj. “Now, over 3,000 families from eight wards under Vattavada panchayat are facing problems for constructing homes or other activities due to the sanctuary area issue. The forest department is blocking all activities in the region under the banner of the proposed sanctuary,” he said, adding that the demand is that the government should complete the verification process immediately. Former Devikulam MLA S Rajendran said that the party district committee did not take a stand that the settlements in Vattavada are encroachments. CPM Idukki district secretary K K Jayachandran said that the party decided to provide title deeds to all eligible people in the region. “The party directed Ramraj to follow party directions and cooperate with other leaders in the region. CPM has raised the rights of people in the region every time,” he said. According to sources, Ramaraj, including other leaders, plan to join CPI in Munnar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/neelakurinji-title-deeds-cpm-leader-resigns-party-post/articleshow/86050498.cms||Sandeep Thomas
---||Rajkot||Class starts but kids find ‘new normal’ tricky||Rajkot/ Vadodara: Before Covid-19 induced pandemic forced them to physically shut down, schools were not just the place for students to study but also to make friends in classrooms, build relations and break ice with those from diverse backgrounds on playgrounds. A majority of schools in the state have partially re-opened after a long break of 18 months. But students have now started facing psychological challenges. Some schools have also started counselling children to avoid long term impact on their personality. “Students of all classes are facing problems. But we believe that students of class 6 to 8 face more problems compared to their seniors. They become introverted and get irritated immediately. Even in sports, children get tired early because they have lost practice. They have started preferring more indoor games which implies that they are not physically active,” said Hetal Parikh, principal of Greenwood International School. School administrators are observing that children remain bewildered and are not intermingling as they used to in pre-Covid era. “There are 13 schools in Rajkot who have given counselling training to three teachers each from their schools. These teachers are trained by Saurashtra University's psychology department," said D V Mehta, chairman of Genius group of schools. Psychologists say that students are not mixing with each other like in the past because of lack of re-orientation towards the “new normal”. “When, as parents, we ask kids that they are supposed to save themselves, they start isolating themselves from others. They stay away from each other. Adults do understand that we can mingle while wearing a mask or keeping a safe distance. But kids do not understand that they too can mingle while keeping precautions. It is important that parents re-teach/ re-orient them because everybody requires re-learning after the pandemic,” said Dr Gitanjali Roy, assistant professor at Department of Psychology of M S University. “Also, every family has gone through some or other kind of suffering – be it illness or death of someone. Kids too have witnessed that. So, they get scared that they would catch infection. If we re-orient them, they will learn and kids are very fast learners,” she said.

---||Delhi||Noise annoys, it can lead to dementia too||NEW DELHI: Prolonged exposure to noise caused by road and rail traffic adds to the risk of developing dementia, a new study published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) suggests. Dementia is an umbrella term for several diseases affecting memory, other cognitive abilities and behaviour that interfere significantly with a person’s ability to maintain their activities of daily living. TimesViewThe study needs to be taken seriously, especially in a city like Delhi, which has the highest number of vehicles in India and suffers from every possible form of pollution. Authorities must find ways and means to reduce noise pollution.The BMJ study found that a 10-year average exposure to road traffic and railway noise was associated with a higher risk of dementia. It is based on an analysis of long-term exposure to noise from the two sources among the two million adults aged over 60 and living in Denmark between 2004 and 2017 and the identification of new cases of dementia in the country during the period. India has witnessed rapid urbanisation over the past decade. Doctors say the findings should prompt authorities to plan ways to reduce exposure to noise pollution. According to Dr Ravi Meher, professor of ENT at Maulana Azad Institute of Medical Sciences, there are such previous reports but this one is a large study that is going to stimulate medical professionals to further work on it. “And obviously this study again emphasises on the adverse effect of noise on human health. The National Green Tribunal and government should take note of it and plan ways to decrease noise exposure,” he said. Dr Kameshwar Prasad, former head of neurology at AIIMS, who is currently the head of Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences, Ranchi, said noise pollution was known to be associated with coronary artery disease and diabetes. “The findings of this study are important, though it requires confirmation in population-based large size studies. If confirmed, this can be a potentially modifiable risk factor for dementia,” he stated. Possible explanations for an effect of noise on health include release of stress hormones and sleep disturbance, the BMJ study states. “Fifteen years ago, we used to see one or two cases in a month. Now, we see one new case in a week. One of the reasons behind this could be increased awareness and availability of diagnostic facilities. But, it is a fact that the prevalence of the disease has also increased significantly over the years,” Dr Praveen Gupta, director of neurology division at Fortis Memorial Research Institute in Gurgaon, said. He added that the Danish study linking noise pollution to the risk of development of dementia was an eye-opener though it does not establish a cause and effect relationship. “We cannot wait for the evidence. Noise pollution is a modifiable risk factor which is also associated with hearing-related complications and therefore focus needs to be on reducing the exposure,” Dr Gupta said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/noise-annoys-it-can-lead-to-dementia-too/articleshow/86050476.cms||Durgesh Nandan Jha

Before the festival, novena is held in churches and chapels, however, from last year, the novenas were also restricted, and worship happened in houses. The showering of flowers on ‘Balok Mori’ was omitted in most of the churches, owing to the pandemic. “Only placing a flower on the statue of Mother Mary was encouraged from last year, and the same has continued this year as well,” said Fr Vijay Victor Lobo, PRO of diocese of Mangalore, adding that masses were increased to two or three, in order to avoid any rush in churches.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/coast-celebrates-monti-fest-in-simple-manner/articleshow/86046031.cms||---

Of the eight elephants, tusker Ashwathama is the new entrant, who is groomed to be a howdah elephant for future. Like last season, veteran Abhimanyu will be assigned the task of carrying the golden howdah on his back and amble inside the Mysuru Palace premises on October 15 given that the Dasara procession is restricted to within the palace premises. Mysuru district minister ST Somashekar headed a Dasara executive committee on Wednesday and gave a go-ahead to the forest department’s plan to get eight elephants for Dasara duties in Mysuru. They will leave Nagarahole forest on September 13 and camp at Aranya Bhavan. On September 16, they will be accorded a traditional welcome at Jayamarthanda Gate of the palace. Somashekar said as the procession is pared down, it is decided to celebrate the procession of idol of goddess Chamundeshwari starting from Chamundi Hills to the palace on October 15. Earlier the idol was carried without any fanfare to the palace premises. To add allure to the celebrations, it is decided to focus on illumination given that it does not lead to crowding and adhere to SOPs. As against 50 kms special illumination of major roads and junctions last year, this season 100 kms will be illuminated from October 7 when the Dasara festival will be launched atop Chamundi Hills. The minister said the chief minister Basavaraj Bommai, who is empowered to name the VIP who will inaugurate the festival, is yet to finalise it. He said the number of invitees to the procession and to cultural events at the palace premises is yet to be decided and depends on the rate of positivity. It is decided to include three tableaux during the procession, which will include folk artists and Mysuru Police Band. Mayor Sunanda Palanetra, MP Pratap Simha, MLAs GT Devegowda, SA Ramadas, L Nagendra, Niranjan Kumar, B Harshavardhana, deputy commissioner Bagadi Gautham, who is the Dasara special officer, police commissioner Chandragupta and DCF Karikalan attended the meeting.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/eight-jumbos-to-be-posted-for-dasara-duty-this-yr/articleshow/86046074.cms||---

---||Mumbai||Day after BMC, Maharashtra govt bans physical Ganpati darshan across state||MUMBAI: With the threat of a third wave looming, the state government on Wednesday banned physical darshan by devotees at Ganpati mandaps across the state. Darshan for the festival starting Friday will have to be only online or telecast through electronic media, said the state’s guidelines. On Tuesday, the BMC had issued a similar order. Last week, the state had issued a series of guidelines, including a ban on processions to mark the arrival and immersion of the Ganesh idol and made an appeal to the public to celebrate at home. It also capped the height of the idols at four feet in community Ganpati mandaps and two feet at home. The state had urged devotees to choose idols made of clay so that they could be immersed at home itself. Earlier, the Union health secretary had written to the state government, asking it to consider the imposition of local restrictions during the festive season. Besides these restrictions, an RTPCR negative test report has been made a must for those travelling to the districts of Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg, except for those who are fully vaccinated and those under 18. These districts have limited healthcare facilities and a high positivity rate. Opinion is divided among organisers about the curbs. “The ban has been declared just two days before the festival. The government has allowed trains and political processions. They should at least have allowed locals to come for darshan,” said Swapnil Parab from the Mumbaicha Raja mandal. Other organisers said they were expecting the ban since similar restrictions were imposed last year during the pandemic. “We were not planning physical darshan in any case. We have a tie-up with Geo TV and one website to telecast darshan and aarti,” said R Bhat from the GSB Seva Mandal, Kings Circle. “Last year, we had 1.3 crore views during the festival,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-day-after-bmc-govt-bans-physical-ganpati-darshan-across-the-state/articleshow/86050685.cms||Priyanka Kakodkar

Due to the absence of a syndicate meeting because of pandemic, the university was functioning with financial sanction by the governor. It was revealed at the meeting that the university was running at a loss of about Rs 157 crore. The decisions taken by the academic council for MPAT examination (for admission of PhD students) were also passed at the meeting and now it is expected that exams will be held soon. The university will give a certificate for research to students doing PhD as per the rules of UGC. Apart from this, it was decided to send the recommendations of six research associate teachers of the university who were still waiting for their promotion to the government. As soon as the permission of the government is received, the university will give the benefit of promotion to all these teachers. Vice chancellor Rajeev Jain said, “Losses are because the strength of students has decreased but liabilities are same. Earlier, Jaipur, Dausa, Sikar, Bharatpur and Alwar colleges were under Rajasthan University with 11 lakh students. Now, only Jaipur and Dausa colleges are under university’s jurisdiction with 6.5 lakh students.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/ru-syndicate-meet-okays-rs-317cr-budget-after-6-months-delay/articleshow/86052135.cms||---

Eulalia D’Souza of Lia Travels and Tours, said with restrictions to Gulf countries being lifted, things have started moving slowly in a positive direction. The recent Gulf country to ease restrictions is Dubai, which will host Expo 2020 from October 1. “The industry hit rock-bottom last year. This season we are witnessing gradual growth, in travel and tourism domestically. However, there is still an apprehension among travellers due to the fear of Covid-19,” said Eulalia, adding that the industry needs a boost. Another stakeholder pointed out that it will not revive completely, as long as restrictions are in place. “It is difficult for a person to travel to certain states, even when they are fully vaccinated. The person needs to carry a negative RT-PCR test report. The test costs a lot of money and takes away time,” said the person, giving the example of travellers from Maharashtra and Kerala, who want to enter Karnataka, and have to produce these documents. “The government should ease restrictions for fully vaccinated travellers,” the person said. “Only job aspirants are trying to go to Dubai on a visit visa,” said another travel industry head. “A lot of students are travelling to the UK, Canada, USA and European countries for studies. Students are paying a hefty amount for flight tickets that range from Rs 2.3 lakh to 2.5 lakh, which are otherwise available at half the cost or less,” the person added. Loveleen Multani Arun, director of Panache World, Bengaluru, says that lots of people are planning holidays in October. Diwali and the festive season are typically busy in the domestic sector, due to the short duration of holidays. “This time the travel and tourism industry is also seeing an upbeat sentiment. Things should look up for Indian tourist destinations, but everything is subject to the Covid-19 situation,’’ she said. “The enquiries from tourists are better than compared to other months, and the industry may see a revival from October,” says Vathika Pai, head of operations at Nirmala Travels. “There have been enquiries from people about tours abroad, as well as domestic ones. Domestically, North India is the most preferred destination and locally, people are driving to nearby places in Karnataka,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/hopes-for-revival-of-travel-and-tourism-this-festive-season/articleshow/86046079.cms||Kevin Mendonsa

Police have detained two people in the case. The deceased, Yogesh, was a resident of Mukundpur village and involved in two criminal cases. Police said, his uncle was injured in a road accident and was admitted to the hospital and Yogesh was visiting him on the night of the incident. The cops said the victim was sitting outside the hospital when the accused on bikes caught him. “A group of men thrashed Yogesh and shot him in the chest, leg and back,” a cop said. He was rushed to the hospital where he was declared dead. On Wednesday, there was a party in Mukundpur, which was attended by both the accused and the victim. “An argument broke out between them during the party, when all of them were drunk. The accused were abused by the victim’s associates there,” a cop said, adding that to take revenge, they killed Yogesh. “A further probe revealed that two groups in Mukundpur village were fighting over supremacy. We are probing if the fight over the same issue led to the argument,” police added. Aalap Patel, additional DCP (North West), said they had launched a manhunt to arrest the accused. One of the detainees has a criminal background. The investigation further revealed that the main conspirator was recently released from jail and was absconding after killing Yogesh.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/2-detained-after-man-shot-outside-hospital/articleshow/86080744.cms||---

The circumambulation at the temple is being allowed after nearly one-and-a-half years. While allowing the devotees to do pradakshina, the temple management, however, said it should be done only outside the temple walls and not inside the walking arena close to the sanctum sanctorum. With Covid-19 cases still being reported, the management had decided to allow devotees to do circumambulation outside the temple precincts. It may be recalled circumambulation at the temple was stopped in March 2020 due to a surge in Covid-19 positive cases. Sources said even the decision to allow circumambulation outside the temple was taken after several devotees made repeated pleas to the temple management. “As the present situation is not conducive for permitting the devotees to do circumambulations inside the temple complex, we have decided to allow them to do pradakshina outside the temple walls,” temple chief priest CS Rangarajan said. “As educational institutions have reopened, several students have expressed a desire to allow them to do pradakshina. In order to fulfil their wish, we are now permitting them to do circumambulation,” Rangarajan told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/pradakshinas-allowed-at-chilkur-temple/articleshow/86052137.cms||Sunil Mungara

---||Mumbai||Will field OBC candidate in seats reserved for OBCs if quota row isn’t resolved: NCP||MUMBAI: Sharad Pawar-led NCP on Wednesday made it clear that in the event the row over OBC reservation in local bodies is not resolved and the state election proceeds with the polling process, the NCP will field OBC candidates on the seats reserved for OBCs. The decision was taken at a high-level meeting presided over by NCP president Sharad Pawar. Apart from senior NCP leaders, the marathon meeting was attended by 114 candidates who had contested the 2019 assembly elections. “NCP view on OBC reservation in local bodies is very clear. We are in favour of postponing the elections until the row over OBC reservations is resolved. However, owing to constitutional amendment, it will not be possible to postpone the elections for an indefinite period. If the apex court gives its verdict, then elections are inevitable. In that event, we will nominate OBC candidates on seats reserved for OBCs,” said NCP spokesperson and skill development minister Nawab Malik after the meeting. Malik said alarmed by the spiralling prices of petroleum products and essential commodities, NCP will soon launch a statewide agitation, but it will be in keeping with the Covid-19 protocol. Pawar asked NCP cabinet members to personally tour flood-affected areas and draft an action plan for providing relief and rehabilitation measures. “Guardian ministers must undertake extensive tours of the flood-affected districts, interact with officers and chalk out an action plan,” said Pawar said. Malik admitted that since it is a three party government, it is likely that cabinet members will have a soft corner for legislators from their party. Even when it was a two party government, similar complaints had surfaced. . “Despite such a situation, we have to work for the cause of the people and ensure that justice is done to the people,” Malik said. On the issue of elections to the local self-organisations, Malik said it was decided that alliance formula will depend on local political conditions and situation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/will-field-obc-candidate-in-seats-reserved-for-obcs-if-quota-row-isnt-resolved-in-mumbai-ncp/articleshow/86052198.cms||Prafulla Marpakwar
---||Lucknow||All beneficiaries can be jabbed by Jan if vax drive keeps Sept pace||Lucknow: If Covid vaccinations continue in Lucknow at the same pace as the daily average witnessed in September so far, every eligible adult in the city will be partially vaccinated with a shot in the next 45 days. Moreover, the entire district’s population above 18 years will be fully vaccinated by January. According to data available with the office of the chief medical officer, September is witnessing the fastest daily vaccination rate in Lucknow since the roll out of the mass immunisation campaign against Covid-19 on January 16. In January, the daily average was nearly 1,295 which has now increased to 46,873 in September because of mega vaccination drives. The adult population of Lucknow is around 36 lakh. A total of 29.8 lakh doses have been administered in eight months since January. About 8.2 lakh people (23% of the eligible population) have completed two-dose vaccine courses (total 16.4 lakh doses) and more than 13.4 lakh people have got a single shot so far. This means that 14.4 lakh people have not received any dose of the vaccine. If these people are administered doses with the same pace as it has been in September so far, it will take 31 working days to cover all with at least one dose. If weekly off and holidays are taken out, the target can be achieved in around 45 days. Authorities need to administer 42.2 lakh doses to fully vaccinate the 13.4 lakh people who have received one shot so far and 14.4 lakh people who have not taken any dose till date. With September’s pace, this population can be inoculated with both doses in 90 days. After factoring in holidays, weekly off and gap period between two doses, it will require a maximum of 120 days to cover the entire population, that is by January first week. “We will organise mega drives on regular basis to further accelerate vaccination and achieve the target by the end of the year,” said officials.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/all-beneficiaries-can-be-jabbed-by-jan-if-vax-drive-keeps-sept-pace/articleshow/86052184.cms||Vivek Singh Chauhan

Cops said that Mohammad Hanif Kasamani alias Mamu Dadhi, who used to work as a land broker, was attacked by 13 assailants near Bhaktinagar Circle. Police said that the attack was carried out over an old enmity. The attackers fled the spot after carrying out the attack. Dadhi’s son Maqbool Kasmani (25), a resident of Khatkivas in Morbi town, lodged a complaint against 13 persons — Rafiq Mandviya, Iqbal alias bottle Chania, Arif Gulam Mir, Ismail Bloch, Riyaz Dosani, Irfan Bloch, Ramiz Chania, Maqsood Sama, Ezaz Chania and four unidentified persons — under various sections of Indian Penal Code and Arms act including murder, attempted murder and rioting.

DG (ACB) B L Soni said councillor Zahid Nibran was caught red-handed while accepting the bribe. ACB said that the accused had demanded a bribe of Rs 60,000 from the complainant for a permit for construction. The accused had earlier taken Rs 20,000 for the same work. The complainant had approached the central probe agency alleging that the councillor was continuously demanding a bribe for permission. The bureau continued a team led by an additional SP (ASP) rank official to ascertain allegations made against the councillor, who won as an independent candidate from ward number six of the JMC-Heritage. Soni informed TOI that the accused had already taken a bribe of Rs 20,000 earlier during the verification drive. “The local councillor is responsible for granting a no-objection certificate (NOC). The accused had first complained about the construction and then demanded a bribe for granting permission,” Soni said, adding that the complainant had approached the bureau to complain about the councillor for demanding a bribe. “Allegations relating to the bribe were found to be true during the verification process. We laid a trap and arrested the accused while taking the bribe amount,” an official said, adding that the accused had so far taken a bribe of Rs 40,000 from the for the work.

A strong vaccination drive across the state has improved the travel sentiment among families. Local destinations such as Srisailam, Warangal, Ramappa Temple, Narsapur forest, Nagarjunasagar, Anantagiri Hills are preferred destinations among travellers, who are preferring their own vehicles to visit these places. “Our idea was to get away from the hustle bustle of the city and visit a location which was closer to the environment. Therefore, we have decided to visit Srisailam which is barely a three-four hours’ drive from the city. The idea is to also go on a hike in the forest area,” said Devesh Vishnu, an IT employee. The Telangana State Tourism Development Corporation Ltd (TSTDC) expects the number of travellers to the local destinations to increase during the ensuing weekend. “Temple tourism has always been in rage in Telangana. However, due to monsoon and world heritage tag to Ramappa temple, the number of travellers to places such as Nagarjunasagar, Srisailam and Warangal have substantially increased. During the ensuing weekend too, we are expecting a 10-15% rise among travellers,” said Upppala Srinivas Gupta, chairman, TSTDC. The pandemic has led to a shift towards more private vacations, as people are choosing private villas over fancy hotels. Families wanting to wash off the pandemic fatigue are finding more comfort and safety at holiday homes. “We will be visiting the Anantagiri Hills during the weekend. We have booked a private villa near Vikarabad where we would be spending three days amid mango trees. The idea is to stay safe even while travelling,” said Shouvik Pal, a software engineer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/ganesh-clears-path-to-hills-over-long-weekend/articleshow/86052171.cms||---
---||Hyderabad||HC slams Telangana, stays takeover of University of Hyderabad land||HYDERABAD: In a relief to University of Hyderabad (UoH), the Telangana high court on Wednesday restrained the state from taking away a portion of the varsity land and ordered status quo. The HC also slammed the state for the shabby treatment meted out to the prestigious central varsity in the city. “On one hand you display a hostile attitude towards central institutions; on the other hand, you accuse the Union government of not sanctioning central educational institutions as promised in the bifurcation Act,” a bench of Acting Chief Justice M S Ramachandra Rao and Justice T Vinod Kumar said as it issued notices to state and revenue officials in the appeal filed by the university challenging the government action to take over a 25-acre plot in UoH. When counsel MV Pratap Kumar, appearing for one of the landowners, pointed out that the row was limited to four acres as the university too has no objection in respect of rest 21 acres, the bench said that its status quo was applicable only to these four acres. The bench, however, cautioned the state counsel, “If you keep taking away their land, how will any central institution come here? If you continue this hostile attitude, we will advise the central university to take up the issue with the Union HRD ministry. Then the Centre will think twice before sanctioning any new institution to Telangana.” The case stems from a row over a 25-acre plot right in the middle of the varsity land. A single judge had earlier dismissed the university’s petition on the ground that state erroneously included 25 acres of private patta land in the 2,300 acres allotted to it in 1974 at Kancha Gachibowli village in Serilingampalli mandal. A civil court too had ruled in favour of the private owners. While the case was on, the university sought the state’s consent to hand over a 12-acre plot near the road in lieu of the 25 acres. The state, however, rejected this and subsequently issued GO Ms No. 1473 in December 2008 resuming land to the extent of 25 acres on the university periphery to give it to private owners in lieu of 25 acres in the middle of UoH. University, however, termed it as unilateral action by state without its consent. The bench sought counters from the authorities and posted the case to November 8.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hc-slams-state-stays-takeover-of-uoh-land/articleshow/86052154.cms||Sagar Kumar Mutha

SHO Chaina Ram Bera said Babu Lal Meena was abducted by around a dozen people from a petrol pump near Bilochi road. “Meena’s brother filed a report at the police station following which we sent multiple teams to track the accused and rescue him,” he said. Police said the accused came in three cars to abduct Meena on Tuesday night. The accused first demanded a ransom of Rs 8 lakh to release him. They later called up Meena’s brother and asked him to pay Rs 20 lakh. “They instructed the businessman’s brother to come to Nivaru flyover near Vaishali Nagar with Rs 20 lakh at 4am,” Bera said. Multiple police teams were sent to over 15 places across Harmara and nearby areas in pursuit of the accused and finally managed to rescue Meena near Bhankrota. They also recovered Meena’s car in which he was abducted. Accused were identified by police as Indra Chand Saini (36), a native of Nagaur, and Babu Singh, a resident of Jalore district. Police said the accused and Meena had a dispute over the payment of old debts. “The two accused claimed that Meena was not returning their money following which they plotted the scheme to make him pay,” an official added. Police said they were hunting for other suspects for their alleged involvement in the abduction plan. “We are examining as to why the accused suddenly decided to abduct Babu Lal Meena. During the interrogation, we are also hopeful of finding names of other suspects,” the official said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/kidnapped-bizman-rescued-by-city-cops-2-arrested-for-crime/articleshow/86052159.cms||---

The rented premises from which it operates also does not have a washroom facility. Earlier, the anganwadi operated from a government structure. However, given the run down condition of the structure it was shifted to rented premises — a single room without basic facilities. Shortly after there were complaints of children falling sick. There are mosquitoes and the smell of cow dung hangs in the air as the anganwadi is located close to a cowshed. “The government has not bothered to reconstruct the anganwadi even as children and staff are exposed to unhygienic conditions,” Gakuved (Gawda, Kunbi, Velip and Dhangar Federation) secretary Rupesh Velip said. Advocate John Fernandes, who is also associated with Gakuved, said that the government has not built a new structure even though it has land. The Adnem village has a population of about 2000. “People in remote villages can’t afford to send their children to nursery schools. There is an urgent need for a proper anganwadi in the village. We have submitted a letter to the director of women and child development requesting for a new anganwadi to be constructed at the old site,” said a local Ramchandra Velip. He said that the director Deepali Naik has assured to allot funds to build a new anganwadi provided the panchayat passes a resolution and issues a NOC.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/adnem-anganwadi-lacks-water-power-facilities/articleshow/86050696.cms||---

From Tilak Jayanthi to Ganesh Chaturthi, Marathis continue to keep their traditions alive in the city through various social and cultural events. Historical records indicate that the several Marathi families have predominantly settled in areas such as Sultan Bazaar, Barkatpura, Kachiguda and Badi Chowdi more than 75 years ago. The growth of the IT and pharma companies in the city has led to migration of younger generations from cities such as Pune, Mumbai, Nagpur, Aurangabad, Osmanabad to name a few. “My family moved to Hyderabad from Kolhapur almost 55 years back. Now, we celebrate every Marathi festival with fervour. Right from Ganesh Chaturthi to Navratri, all our festivities are with the community at large,” said Anand Kulkarni, vice-president, Maharashtra Mandal, one of the oldest Marathi associations in Koti. This year, the Ganesh festivities at the Maharashtra Mandal are celebrating 75 years of India’s independence by giving tributes to the armed forces. Throughout the year, several groups such as the Kalabhishek Pariwar, Bhagini Mandal, Vimal Natya Samaj conduct various socio-cultural events such as Marathi plays, in an effort to promote and sustain the language and culture. Having an influence of saints such as Sant Dnyaneshwar, Eknath, Tukaram, Ramdas among others, the rich Marathi culture revolves around stories and poetries around them. “We hold a programme called ‘Palak aani Balak’ (parents and children) wherein the children are taught everything about our culture including songs, music etc. Apart from this, we have an initiative called ‘Sahitya Saurab’ wherein we conduct programmes around the Marathi literature and culture,” said Saroj Gharapurikar, member of the Kalabhishek Pariwar, who has been instrumental in conducting several such cultural programmes. The Marathi cuisine during the festivities, especially Ganesh Chaturthi, consists of Puran Poli along with generous serving of ghee, Modak, Misal, Poha, Zhunka Bakar, Pithala Bhakar etc. While Marathis from the Konkan are predominantly rice-eaters, those from the Vidarbha region prefer wheat rotis, jowar and bajra.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/hyderabads-marathis-keep-traditions-alive-over-the-years/articleshow/86052204.cms||Preeti Biswas

---||Delhi||Delhi: Muted reopening as less than a third turn up at most private schools||NEW DELHI: A week after reopening following the Covid closure, attendance in private schools is yet to pick up. Even though only half the students are being called for each class in compliance with social distancing requirements, not all of them are turning up. To make sure that those opting to stay home aren’t missing out on lessons, the schools are live-streaming classes for them. The authorities at The Indian School summon just a third of the students of classes X and XII to school from 8am to 11am. Even this truncated class strength is not being met. “It seems parents are still apprehensive about sending their children to school. Of say the third of the students required to come for classes, just 8-9 of them are present,” said principal Tania Joshi. “However, those who are attending classes are happy and satisfied. We hope they will share their experiences with the rest and encourage them to return to school.” From September 13, the school wants to call back the students of classes IX and XI too. “So far, we have received the consent of only around 35% of the parents, but we are hoping the numbers will increase,” said Joshi. At Bal Bharti Public School, Gangaram Hospital Marg, the attendance is equally low. A teacher said, “We aren’t sure if students are not coming because parents are worried or it is because of the examination scheduled next week for classes X and XII.” The school will stick to its earlier decision that the exams would be online. Madhulika Sen, education advisor at Tagore International School, Vasant Vihar, had a similar report. “We are calling 50% of the students in each class, yet if 22 of them have to come, only 10-12 are turning up.” The school, following the instructions of the Directorate of Education, has postponed the exams and will hold them between October and November. At ASN Senior Secondary School in Mayur Vihar too, just 10% of the students of classes IX and XI and approximately 25% of classes X and XII students are attending classes in person. A teacher said, “The parents are reluctant, so we have no option but to follow the hybrid model. The physical classes are live-streamed to home stayers.” The attendance is much higher, at around 80%, in MM Public School, Pitampura. Rooma Pathak, school principal, detailed the routine. “Offline classes are divided into two shifts to ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour,” she said. “The first shift is from 8am to 11am, when students of classes IX and XI come. The second is from 11.30am to 2.30pm and X and XII students come for lessons in bubbles of 12 students per classroom.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/muted-reopening-as-less-than-a-third-turn-up-at-most-pvt-schools/articleshow/86048174.cms||Shradha Chettri

The schools for pre-primary students were closed due to the Covid 19 pandemic in March 2019 and the classes were held only in online mode. Physical classes of senior sections resumed once Covid 19 cases witnessed a fall but schools for other pre-primary continued to remain close. “The government has directed for opening up of Anganwadi schools and has also directed schools of all boards to begin offline classes for all standards. A majority of city schools will be resuming offline classes for pre-primary students following Covid 19 safety norms,” said Unaided Private Schools Association president Anil Agarwal. Meanwhile, City Montessori School opened a school for pre-primary students on Wednesday. Decked up with colourful cartoon characters, flowers and fresh colorful painted walls teachers welcomed the junior students with candies and sweets to campus. Teachers welcomed children to school with friendly postersOn day one of the junior classes around 60% attendance was recorded at the school. “We were not expecting that we would receive such a good number of written consents from the parents of the pre-primary students. The attendance was 60% which was almost equal to the attendance in senior sections,” said CMS spokesperson Rishi Khanna.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/nursery-rhymes-to-echo-on-campus-again-as-tiny-tots-prepare-to-return/articleshow/86052219.cms||---

As per assistant sub-inspector, Chotu Singh, Gangadhar was travelling on his scooter to get milk when a truck rammed into it.Gangadhar was tossed several feet high up in the air before he fell on the road when the truck immediately ran over him. Police suspect that the truck had passed through a railway underpass when it hit the scooter.The truck driver fled the scene even as passers-by tried to stop him. “The accident police station received the information at about 7.30am, and the accident is suspected to have taken place shortly before 7.20am,” Singh said.Police informed the victim’s family members about the accident. “The motorist was taken to the hospital where doctors declared him brought dead. We informed his family members about the mishap,” Singh added.Sources said that it was a very horrifying accident because the victim’s body was completely mangled in the accident. “His face could barely be recognised due to the accident,” an official said. The victim’s 24-year-old son was inconsolable when he looked at his father’s body. “His son almost fell unconscious after seeing the body,” the official said.The body was handed over to the family members after the post-mortem.

---||Delhi||Delhi: Disorder, disorder! physical court hearings spark viral fears||NEW DELHI: After district courts in the capital resumed partial physical hearings from August 24, the judges and court staff are struggling to check overcrowding of courtrooms. While some courts are able to enforce social distancing, others are terribly overcrowded, a risk when the battle against Covid-19 is yet over. TOI visited the Patiala House Courts, Tis Hazari district courts, Karkardooma district courts and Saket district courts in the past two weeks and saw several instances of how the judge’s repeated requests to people to heed social distancing and vacate the courtroom fell into deaf ears. At one proceedings in Tis Hazari, at least 20 lawyers, who were not parties to the case being heard, were present for the entire several-hours’ duration of the hearing. It was only when the judge threatened to conduct the case in his chamber if the lawyers didn’t leave that some did. In another instance at the Saket court, all those whose cases were listed before a judge that day were present with their counsels in the courtroom, more than 10 of them with their lawyers.  Add to that, the police officers, court staff and the public prosecutor, and it was a veritable crowd there. Similarly, in three courtrooms at Patiala House, the judges struggled to have the intransigent lawyers and clients stick of Covid protocols. Senior advocate Rebecca John described this as a “serious problem”. “Not all courts are overcrowded, but I have certainly gone to some courts that are crammed. That’s partly because of the architecture of the court — very small rooms, not enough space for the number of people there,” John said. “Criminal courts particularly should liberally exercise their powers to grant exemptions to accused persons.” The senior counsel added that despite the numerous directions by the high courts to trial courts to exercise their power of exemption, the later appeared hesitant to do so. “This is a serious problem. You cannot open courts without taking into account the potential for overcrowding and its impact on the spread of the virus,” John told TOI. “In the few courts that I have physical gone to, particularly trial courts, my experience has been a mixed bag. Some have been okay, but most are way too overcrowded.” Senior advocate Vikas Pahwa also said Covid protocols weren’t being “scrupulously” followed in the trial courts, primarily due to lack of space and the unending cases, pointing out how Delhi High Court didn’t have such problems because of its big corridors, glass partitions and use of microphones because of which mask weren’t required to be removed. “Trial courts are accessible to the public and there is crowding. And invariably masks have to be taken off when arguing, exposing the judges, lawyers, clients and court staff to the risk of the coronavirus,” said Pahwa. Advocate Vijay Aggarwal said Enforcement Directorate cases usually involved defendants in double digits. “A courtroom with 10 clients and 10 lawyers besides the others and social distancing goes for a toss,” he remarked.  He, however, said the dual physical-and-video conferencing hearings were “too hard on lawyers”. He said, “Managing cases in courts having physical hearings and then trying to be present for virtual hearings is a big problem for the lawyers.” According to advocate Manoj Taneja, a lot is expected from the presiding officers in the courtrooms in the matter of Covid-appropriate behaviour.  “The presiding officer is expected to control the crowd, including the lawyers and litigants,” he said. “Some judges do deal with this strictly and refuse to start the hearing till only the lawyers concerned are left in the courtroom.” Advocate Manish Bhadauria too felt that the judges should allow only those lawyers to enter whose cases were being heard. “The court should call one accused at a time to mark their presence and then summon their counsels into the courtrooms to present their arguments,” Bhadauria added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/disorder-disorder-physical-court-hearings-spark-viral-fears/articleshow/86080864.cms||Usha Das

Sources said that a majority of the Ganesh pandals will benefit with the concessional tariff, which could be as low as Rs 4-8/unit. MSEDCL officials appealed to Ganesh mandals to check wirings in their pandals and ensure that they are properly insulated.

While an 108 emergency ambulance rushed to help Thakar in Timbi village in Jafrabad taluka of Amreli district on Wednesday, non-existent roads made its mission impossible forcing it to wait around half a kilometre away in the village. The woman was finally trundled unceremoniously to the ambulance in a bedsheet by para medical staff with the help of villagers. According to sources, Thakar met with an accident at her home in Timbi village and injured herself. An emergency (108) service ambulance was summoned to take her to a hospital, but rains and deplorable road conditions made the task impossible. So much so, that even carrying a stretcher to her house was out of the question. Thakar was finally admitted to hospital in Rajula town of Amreli district where she is now receiving treatment. However, a video shot by a villager brings to light the pathetic road conditions that the option-less villagers have to endure every monsoon. “We are finding it difficult to live in the village in the monsoon owing to the deplorable state of roads here. We can't even drive our vehicles, forget walking on these roads. Manjulaben got injured at around 4pm on Wednesday and villagers along with ambulance staff took all the pains to carry her up to the ambulance causing her more pain in the half-an-hour walk on uneven surface,” Hamid Mansuri, a villager, told TOI.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/roads-absent-elderly-woman-forced-to-be-taken-in-bedsheet-to-hospital/articleshow/86046202.cms||---

The rat sculpture from Kakatiya era was found in the debris of a dilapidated ‘Trikuta’ temple on the outskirts of Janagam, a village in Godavarikhani mandal. ‘Trikuta’ temple is one of the triple shrines dedicated to Ganesh. “This may be the biggest such sculpture so far reported from the two Telugu states. It might have been originally in the ‘arthamandapa’ before it was by moved and kept under debris probably by treasure hunters,”archaeologist Dr E Sivanagireddy said. It was initially spotted by amateur palaeontologist Samudrala Suneel, an active member of Kotha Telangana Charitra Brundam led by Sriramoju Haragopal. Sivanagireddy said, “Sculptures carved out of red sandstone represent the Kakatiya style of art and iconography. It’s dateable to 13th century based on the architecture of temples during the period of Kakatiya emperor Ganapatideva.”. Urging the state government to protect the rat sculpture of Janagam, he said it should be moved to the safety of temple as it had enormous historical significance and heritage value. The archaeologist said he had also shifted a similar sculpture of same measurements and period, but carved in black basalt stone recovered from the outskirts of Panugal near Nalgonda while digging the Panugal-Kattangur canal in 1988. It is displayed at the district archaeological museum at Panagal, he said.

The administration tied up with a non-government organization (NGO) Yuva Unstoppable for the distribution of one litre pouches. The administration took this initiative considering several myths and superstitions about vaccination which has resulted in reluctance to take the jab in many rural areas. Bhavnagar district development officer (DDO), Prashant Jilova, said “I have asked for the data of vaccinations from every taluka to find out villages where the numbers are less and there is hesitancy among people. The NGO is providing one litre oil pouches in such villages to attract the people for vaccination.” According to officials, the NGOs agreed to provide one lakh edible oil pouches out of which 10,000 are already distributed in the villages of Sihor taluka in the first phase. In rural areas, two lakh doses have been administered in the past two weeks and 68% of the population has been innoculated till date. In the municipal corporation area, around 84% of the population has been given either of two doses.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/rajkot/get-a-jab-take-home-oil-pouch/articleshow/86046224.cms||---

---||Chennai||This Tamil Nadu man scripted brand MGR, helped unseat Jayalalithaa||CHENNAI: RM Veerappan, better known as RMV, turns 95 today. Two years junior to M Karunanidhi and nine years younger to M G Ramachandran, RMV represents the last of the doyens of the Dravidian movement who had the privilege of being an understudy of E V Ramasamy Periyar and C N Annadurai. He is also the only other Dravidian leader of stature to straddle both worlds of rationalism and faith. His contributions as the Hindu religious and charitable endowments minister saw him being invited by the late Kanchi pontiff, Chandrashekarendra Saraswati to have a holy dip with him once. RMV moved with similar ease between filmmaking and politics. Those of the actor Rajinikanth's generation would remember RMV for producing ‘Baasha’. What is less known is that it is at RMV’s prodding that Rajinikanth uttered his famous words that “If Jayalalithaa returns to power, even God cannot save Tamil Nadu” helping the DMK to unseat her in 1996. R M Veerappan used to stage plays for C N AnnaduraiAgain, it is to RMV that we owe the leftist lyricist, Pattukottai Kalyanasundaram’s introduction to films in MGR’s magnum opus ‘Nadodi Mannan’ (1958) and K Balachander in ‘Deivathaai’ (1964) as script writer. Similarly, as MGR and poet Kannadasan fell out, RMV roped in Vaali who penned the timely song “Moondrezhuthil yen moochirukkum” (my breath lives in the three letters, alluding to the DMK) for MGR. MGR had a little earlier quit the legislative council, confounding DMK leaders. A protean filmmaker-turned-politician, RMV wrote and produced movies such as Rajinikanth’s ‘Moondrumugam’. His ‘Rickshawkaran’ and ‘Idhayakkani’ under his Sathya Studios banner were box office hits and also promoted MGR. Though RMV served as MGR’s manager, it is befitting to describe him in western parlance as chief of staff. He is rightly credited for sculpting MGR politically and aiding his metamorphosis from an actor-politician to leader. RMV joined MGR at a time when after his success with ‘Rajakumari’, ‘Mandihirkumai’, ‘Marudhanaatu Ilavarasi’, ‘Marmayogi’ and ‘En Thangai’, the actor was facing stagnation with not-so-successful films like ‘Jenova’, ‘Panakkaari’ and ‘Naam’. Furthermore, MGR had taken the political plunge with the DMK in 1953. At that time, the futures of the DMK and of MGR were still unknown commodities. RMV’s task was cut out. His job was to establish the ‘MGR’ brand. RMV’s role in MGR’s success was such that the other film icon, Sivaji Ganesan, regretted that he didn’t have an RMV to plot his political career. At 27, RMV rechristened the troupe’s first play from ‘Idindha Kovil’ (Fallen Temple) to ‘Inba Kanavu’ (Sweet Dream). In October 1953, MGR debuted in ‘Inba Kanavu’ for a fund raiser in Trichy for the DMK’s now legendary, Three Fronts Agitation, thus, propelling Karunanidhi to stardom. By 1958-59 a resourceful RMV translated MGR’s wish to gift 6,000 raincoats to rickshaw pullers when raincoats were unheard of. Consequently, rickshaws sporting MGR’s image pedalled both passengers and MGR. He shared a camaraderie with M Karunanidhi as well hoping for a united Dravidian movementRMV’s tasks grew more onerous after MGR founded the ADMK (AIADMK from 1976). MGR’s statement on his expulsion crafted by RMV said, “Conspiracy shall befall justice, but justice shall ultimately prevail... I will certainly win.” To make those words come true, RMV worked tenaciously behind the scenes to keep MGR focused on the mammoth task before him. Even as MGR’s manager, RMV had stood in the way of the intense relationship between MGR and his costar J Jayalalithaa, which he felt was consuming his boss’s political potential, if not capital. However, she would return a decade later in 1982, this time parachuted into the AIADMK by MGR. Senior leaders made way for her, but not RMV. Except for a brief period in the 1990s when he was joint secretary general of the reunified AIADMK along with her, RMV will be known for his bitterest opposition to Jayalalithaa. After she dropped him a second time from the cabinet and downgraded him in the party hierarchy, RMV had had enough and founded the MGR Kazhagam, which has kept away from active politics. A man with immense self-respect and dignity, and his detractors might add ambition, RMV remains the Dravidian movement’s Dronacharya. His protegees, most notably, S Jagathrakshagan and ninetime legislator, K A Sengottiyan, and those he had handpicked in 1977 like S Thirunavukkarasar, have had brilliant public careers. It is befitting of his versatility, that in the evening of his life, RMV serves as the president of Kamban Kazhagam which popularises Kamban's Ramayana and the Alwargal Aaivu Maiyam, a centre for research on the Vaishnavite Tamil saints (The writer, R Kannan is the biographer of Anna and MGR)||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/man-who-scripted-brand-mgr-helped-unseat-jaya/articleshow/86050765.cms||---

In the eight days of September, Maharashtra has given about 44% of the doses given in all of August. There was a surge in cases too, with the city logging over 500 for the first time since July 15, pushing up the state’s tally by 4,174. The state has given 63.4 lakh doses in September. Last month, a total of 1.4 crore doses were given, which the state plans to push to more than 2 crore in September. Mumbai, too, saw a major uptick in the drive on Wednesday with over 1.8 lakh doses administered. The city has so far given over a crore shots, vaccinating 29.5 lakh people or just 32% of its adult population with both doses and 43.3 lakh with a single dose. CM Uddhav Thackeray and public health minister Rajesh Tope complimented healthcare workers for pulling off the feat. Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary (health), said the state had broken two of its own previous daily records of 11.04 lakh on August 21 and 12.3 lakh on September 4. BMC and state vaccination centres will administer only second vaccine doses on Thursday. Focus on second dose to blunt severity of 3rd wave: ExpertsAs the vaccination drive accelerates finally, the thrust must be on second doses as less than 20% of the eligible population has been fully immunised in the state. About 48.4% of the adult population has got at least one dose of the vaccine. State Covid-19 task force members have said the focus now has to be on complete vaccination if the severity of the third wave has to be blunted. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said special vaccination days only for those due for the second dose are being scheduled as only 32% of the city’s adult population of 93 lakh has been fully vaccinated. Kakani said an estimated 2.5 lakh people are awaiting their second shot in the city. “The disparity of coverage between districts must be minimised too,” said one of the task force members, adding that in the age bracket of 45-plus, there are districts that have vaccinated 80% while there are some still languishing at 35%. Sindhudurg, for instance, has vaccinated 91% of its 45-plus population with at least one dose. Nanded is sitting at the bottom, having given the first dose to only 35% people in this age segment. In all, Maharashtra has administered 6.6 crore doses, vaccinating 1.8 crore people with both shots and 3 crore with a single shot. In the most vulnerable age group of 45-plus, 55.2% have got at least one dose, while 37.8% in the 18-44 age bracket have received at least one shot. Among states, Maharashtra has done the highest number of full vaccinations though UP has administered the highest count of overall doses (8.3 crore). The private sector in the state has administered 98 lakh doses. Daily vaccinations picked up pace from the third week of August. Average daily vaccinations, barring Sundays, have been in the range of 7 lakh doses. As on Tuesday, the state had 52.8 lakh doses, including 4.3 lakh doses in Mumbai and 3.8 lakh in Pune.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-focus-on-second-dose-to-blunt-severity-of-3rd-wave-experts/articleshow/86050808.cms||Sumitra Debroy
---||Delhi||School students can now learn from IIT-Delhi teachers||NEW DELHI: From September 11, school students will be able to learn about science and research from teachers at Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (IIT-D). Students from classes IX and above can be a part of these weekend lectures and even laboratory demos. As a part of the outreach programme, the institute has started an initiative called “Sci-Tech Spins”. The schools who are interested can write to the associate dean, academic outreach, and nominate four students each. V Ramgopal Rao, director, IIT-Delhi, on launching the initiative, said, “IIT-Delhi has taken up the institute’s social responsibility on a major level. We not only want to provide education to students who come to IIT-Delhi, but also want to connect with thousands of other students who are outside the IIT system and inspire and help them in all possible ways. The goal of Sci-Tech Spins is to connect with every school in the country.” He added, “On the education part, IIT-Professor Assisted Learning (PAL) is one thing that IIT-Delhi has championed with participation from other IITs. On the research side also, several exciting things are happening on the campus. Showcasing these research works to the school students so that they get inspired is also one of the aims of this initiative.” The showcase of the research will be done by inviting the students who attend these lectures to “Open House”, an annual event of the institute, where they showcase the research work. Students will also be provided with e-certificates after attending the lectures. The lecture and the laboratory demonstration sessions will also be live streamed on YouTube to allow access to students from across the country. The first lecture titled ‘Design Thinking — A Powerful Tool for Problem Solving’ accompanied by the lab demo will be delivered by PV Madhusudan Rao, head of the department of design, on September 11. Explaining the idea behind the programme, Pritha Chandra, associate dean, academic outreach and new initiatives, said, “We regularly receive multiple requests from schools for campus tours, workshops and mentorship programmes for their students. IIT-Delhi wanted to take a more proactive stance on academic outreach for schools, and this was the genesis of the idea behind Sci-Tech Spins.” Along with the professors, PhD students and research scholars of the institute will also contribute to this initiative by sharing their experiences.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/school-students-can-now-learn-from-iit-d-teachers/articleshow/86048268.cms||Shradha Chettri

The boy, Mohammed Adnan, who was bitten on his thigh, elbow and ear, was rescued by parents and passersby. “The boy had stepped out to play with other children around 7pm when power supply went off. The stray dogs attacked him while it was still dark. Had he not been rescued in time, the dogs would have mauled him,’’ said Mohammed Farooq, a relative. The latest incident led to fresh call from residents to rid the area of stray dogs whose numbers have been increasing in and around Kishanbagh. People have accused the GHMC officials of doing little despite multiple complaints on the dog menace. “Prior to this, another boy, Mohammed Ayan, was chased and mauled to death by dogs at Asadbaba Nagar this year. GHMC officials have completely failed to address public issues in the Old City,’’ said Mohammed Ahmed, GHMC minority vice-president of TTDP. Locals said that piles of garbage on roads was becoming a magnet for stray dogs. “Dogs in search of food are always around the garbage dumped on roads.

In the 24 hours ended 8.30am on Wednesday, though, some places in the suburbs did report more than 100mm rainfall, including at Goregaon, Vikhroli and Bhandup. Starting Thursday, the Indian Meteorological Department has issued a green alert and forecast only moderate rain for the city, which will likely continue till Sunday. IMD officials said there was a bigger cloud mass over the sea than on land, due to which the expected intense rain activity did not materialize. Shubhangi Bhute, scientist, IMD Mumbai, said, “The weather system which had formed, moved away very rapidly into the sea. Had it stayed over land longer, the city would have got over 200mm rain. However, 3-4 stations did report over 100mm of rain.” Data from the automatic weather stations till Wednesday morning showed Ram Mandir had reported 104mm rain, Koparkhairane 119.8mm, Goregaon 124.2mm, Andheri 99mm, Vikhroli 129mm and Bhandup 108mm. In the 24 hours ended 8.30am, the IMD’s Colaba observatory reported average rain of 38mm while the one at Santacruz recorded 78.7mm. Meanwhile, the total seasonal rain in case of both the IMD’s Colaba and Santacruz observatories has crossed the 2,000mm mark with the one at Colaba recording 2,076.3mm rain. The IMD’s Santacruz observatory had already crossed the 2,000mm seasonal rain mark and so far has recorded 2,731.8mm of it. The IMD said another low pressure area is likely to form over the north and the adjoining Central Bay of Bengal around September 11, which is likely to become more marked during the subsequent 24 hours. Meanwhile, water stocks in the lakes that supply to Mumbai stood at 93.65% as on Wednesday, just 6% short of the 100% mark. When compared to the past two years, this year the lakes have taken the longest time to reach 100% capacity though. In 2020, water stocks in the lakes on September 8 stood at 98.25% and on the same date in 2019 at 97.7%.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/bhandup-goregaon-get-over-100mm-rain-but-no-big-spells-in-most-areas/articleshow/86050947.cms||Richa Pinto

While TNAU issued admission notifications for its various programmes, BSc Sericulture was missing from the admission prospectus of the university.Shocked by the omission, students of fourth, third and second year along with a few PhD students of the sericulture department staged a demonstration in front of the college against the decision. They sought TNAU to admit students to BSc Sericulture.S Ranjith Kumar, a PhD scholar from the sericulture department, pointed out that in 2016 the state government included BSc Sericulture as an eligibility for the post of assistant inspector in the state department of sericulture. By stopping admission, the university is underestimating the value of the course.“The degree programme has been kept in abeyance,” said N Kumar, vice-chancellor of TNAU, Coimbatore, while speaking to TOI over phone.He said Mettupalayam is not a suitable place for the programme. They are looking for other places for the department and till then it will be kept in abeyance.“There is low admission to the course over the last few years. There are also not many government jobs for those pursuing the course,” the vice-chancellor said.Stating that there is no demand for the programme and they could not fill even 30 available seats in the first year, the V-C said that the course is not closed. “We will discuss with the state government and see what can be done,” he said.At present, 77 students are studying in the four-year BSc, MSc and PhD programmes offered in the department of sericulture.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/students-protest-deferring-of-admission-to-bsc-sericulture/articleshow/86050847.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

The National Statistical Office (NSO) report released in January says the literacy rate among males in the survey year (2017 and 2018) was 80.08%, while for females it was 57.6%. The literacy rate of females in the state is the second-worst in the country. The census data of 2001 and 2011 says literacy levels in the state have jumped from 60.40% to 66.11%. Women have registered a major jump from 43.90% to 52.12% while men have recorded a slight rise from 75.70% to 79.19% in the same duration. “The major concern here is the huge gender gap at the level where we are assessing people on simple reading, writing and maths. It is evident that girls are facing discrimination when it comes to education right from primary level. It has come at a time when governments have moved to the next level and working hard on improving the gross enrolment ratio of females in schools, colleges and universities,” said Rashmi Jain, head of the sociology department, Rajasthan University. She pointed out that tackling the problem by merely framing progressive policies and schemes is not enough. Government efforts such as 'Prodh Shiksha Abhiyaan' in the 90s and 'Saksharata Abhiyan' have reached their limits. “The time has come to challenge the mindset of people towards educating girls. Communities and blocks where the rate of literacy is low have been identified for years. It's time to intervene by communicating with these communities by providing perks and engaging socio-religious leaders,” added Jain. The 2011 Census figures say female literacy was worst in Jalore and Sirohi with 38.47% and 39.73%, respectively. The worst performing block for the same reason was Kotra in Tonk with a 16.49% literacy rate of females.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/at-23-raj-has-biggest-gender-divide-in-literacy/articleshow/86050892.cms||---

Vinit Kumar Yadav, 38, had a fight with wife Shashi, 35, after her parents reportedly refused to finance a new sofa in his house to replace an old one given to the couple as dowry.

It is expected to be more challenging for them than the repeaters, who had either completed their board exam last year or in the previous years.“Repeaters have the privilege of attending offline classes for board exam and NEET coaching. Above all, they had appeared in the board exams physically,” said S Naveen, a NEET aspirant in a private school at Ramanathapuram. “We spent the entire year attending online classes from home, except for a few weeks of offline classes in March and April for exam preparation,” he said.However, board exams were cancelled this year and marks were allotted on the basis of internal assessment and previous board examination marks. The exam will be a challenge for freshers appearing for the first time.“The ratio of repeaters has been gradually increasing. Previously, only 3-4% of those appearing for NEET were repeaters. Now, over 10% are repeaters,” said P S Martin, principal of Nava Bharath National School. “It was a challenge to prepare students remotely. But only those who are interested would take up the test. We had allocated dedicated teachers to monitor progress of students,” he said. Out of the 6,057 students, 397 are from government and government-aided schools. They have been attending free online NEET coaching classes conducted by the state government.“Keeping students focused on the preparation was challenging as the test was getting delayed.

Following the stream of consciousness style of writing, he has over the years explored surrealistic and magical dreamscapes in his stories. His works are often mind-teasers and have won him the Ki Ra award, instituted by Vijaya Pathippagam’s Readers Circle and Sakthi Masala, for the year 2021. In his writings, there isn’t much of the story as such, only a string of incidents. Thus, the reader feels a sense of enigma, whose thinking is abstract and sometimes even inscrutable. S Ramakrishnan, who has known Konangi for more than 30 years, likens the writer's works to that of raga alapana, for which the reader has to be prepared for an intellectual ride. Son Tamil writer Shanmugam, and grandson of playwright and freedom fighter Madurakavi Baskaradoss, Konangi was named Illangovan. His pen-name Konangi has two explanatory notes: First, the concept and visualization of Bharathiar’s Puthiya Konangi with the word Puthiya omitted and the second would be from a story narrated by poet Gnanakoothan, about a mythological story of Vishnu seeking a boon from Siva, when Siva orders Vishnu to perform a “konangi koothu” (dance-drama). Konangi hails from literary doyen Ki Ra’s native of the karisal region, but his similes and metaphors are after a different style approaching post-modernism in their idiom. They follow a motif that is oriented with the images he visualises. Konangi confesses that writers like Poomani, Pa Jeyapragasam, So Dharman, and Suyambulingam, reflected the culture and practices prevailing in their native land. He on the other hand traveled further beyond choosing to be a dreamer too. The main inspiring influence on him has been that of Na Muthusamy followed by Nagulan, Mouni and Rajendra Chozan. The many paths he has thus travelled feature in his works. His new work ‘Neer Valari’ (Water Boomerang) has come to be known as an objectbased novel. It is an age -old concept used by fishermen to catch fish. Conscious of the environment and the changes to the natural world, the writer has highlighted the relationship of man and nature through his work. Scholar François Édouard Stéphane Gros has translated Konagai’s ‘Paazh’ to French. It is part of ‘Nagalinga Maram’ or ‘Sama Kalath Tamil Kathaigal’. In its last two paragraphs it takes on man for his inhumanity unto nature. It tells poignantly how he destroys forest wealth and audible to us is the voice of the burning wood’s murmurs in protest. Konangi has been instrumental in bringing out the magazine ‘Kalkuthirai’, since 1989, which had issues with special focus on international authors like Fyodor Dostoevsky and Gabriel Garcia Marquez. Through him Tamil readers also had the benefit of reading translated works of Raymond Carver, Octavio Paz, Haruki Murakami, Italo Calvino and Vladimir Nabokov. The writer however, invites polar opposite views. For instance, Bava Chelladurai, one of his longstanding friends, says. “When Konangi made his debut with ‘Mathinimargal Kathai’ (1987), he seemed to be his true self, a storyteller of the future. But his subsequent works had a tendency to needlessly capture isms, taking him away from Tamil readers.” As for Konangi himself, he understands the language of the mountains and even empty space has something to convey to him and get lovably close.

---||Pune||Pune: More children coming down with bad cough, cold & fever||PUNE: Paediatricians across the city are seeing a rise in children, mainly below five years, complaining of bad cough, cold and fever. When medically investigated, they test negative for Covid-19, but positive for common cold viruses like respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and seasonal flu. The early phase of illness in RSV-infected kids is often mild, just like a cold. The illness, in some cases, may move into the lungs and cause severe coughing and wheezing. “There is a significant rise in the number of children complaining of bad cough, which takes a lot of time to get cured. About 40-50% of the children, who have undergone a broad spectrum seasonal viruses test called multiplex-PCR, have tested positive for RSV. After RSV, flu viruses, including H3N2 and parainfluenza virus, are also being seen in many others,” paediatrician Pramod Jog said. Over the last two months (July and August), Jog has treated approximately 6,000 children of all age groups with flu-like symptoms. “Of these, not a single child has tested positive for Covid-19,” Jog, who is the formal national president of the Indian Academy of Paediatrics, said. He is also one of the members of the newly formed paediatric state Covid task force. Typically, RSV causes a cold, which may be followed by bronchiolitis — an inflammation of smaller airways. “RSV is the most common cause of inflammation of the small airways in the lungs (bronchiolitis) in children below five years,” Jog said. With strict adherence to mask-wearing and physical distancing, there were fewer cases of RSV in 2020. “The number of children I see every day has doubled in the last few days. Barring a few sporadic cases of Covid, most children are testing positive for RSV and influenza viruses. Parents should not panic as RSV-linked illness take a little longer time to get fully resolved,” paediatrician Sanjay Mankar said. Agreeing Jehangir hospital’s chief paediatrician Sanjay Bafna said, “There is a significant rise in kids complaining of flu-like symptoms. Wearing masks even at home is needed to prevent the spread. Antibiotics are not used to treat RSV. Treatment for RSV is done to help ease symptoms. It’s very important to make sure your child drinks plenty of fluids.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/more-children-coming-down-with-bad-cough-cold-fever/articleshow/86050909.cms||Umesh Isalkar

---||Pune||Over 24,000 avail benefit of free Covid treatment||Pune: A total of 24,082 moderate to severely ill Covid-19 patients in the Pune Metropolitan Region have availed the benefit of free treatment under the state-sponsored health scheme at 45 empanelled public and private hospitals since May last year. Mainly people from lower and middle-income categories availed the benefit of the scheme though every citizen irrespective of financial status could avail it, an official said. Looking at the number of beneficiaries, health activists claimed, the scheme had not been used to its fullest potential. Amol Maske, regional manager of the state health scheme Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana (MJPJAY) in Pune, said, “Mildly infected patients are not included in the scheme. Moderate to severely ill patients needing oxygen therapy — with blood oxygen saturation below 94 — and those requiring intensive care can avail the benefit of the scheme at empanelled hospitals.” On May 1, 2020, Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope had first announced that all citizens would be covered under the state government’s health scheme, MJPJAY, irrespective of their financial status. Rules were amended during the lockdown to include all ration card holders under MJPJAY so that financial constraints did not become an obstacle in accessing timely Covid treatment for anyone. Health activist and medical practitioner Abhijit More said, “Looking at the number of beneficiaries, the scheme has not been used to its fullest potential. There is almost no rider. Anyone can avail of the benefit irrespective of the income slab. The government should have made more efforts to popularise the scheme because many families from the middle and lower-middle class households have financial constraints.” Sanjay Patil, the chairman of the Indian Medical Association’s Hospital Board of India, Pune chapter, said, “Currently, a total of 120 hospitals in PMR are providing treatment to patients with Covid-19. Among them, the scheme’s free treatment benefit can be availed only at 45 empanelled hospitals. More Covid hospitals need to be brought under the net.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/over-24000-avail-benefit-of-free-covid-treatment/articleshow/86050949.cms||Umesh Isalkar
---||Kolkata||Police bank on tech evidence to crack Behala double murder case||Kolkata: Two days after 42-year-old woman Susmita Mondal and her 13-year-old son Tamojit were found with their throats slit at their second-floor flat at Behala’s Senpally, police are now focussing on technical and forensic evidence for a breakthrough after nine key witnesses gave “conflicting” statements. Cops on Wednesday let the victim’s husband — Tapan Mondal — go after questioning him for several hours. For now, “personal revenge” by a person who was “close to either the mother or the son” seemed the most likely reason behind the double murder so far. Marathon questioning of Susmita’s husband, a loan recovery agent of a private bank, has revealed several anomalies in his statements but not enough yet to accuse him of murder. Police have found corroboration of Tapan’s claim that he was at work during the time of murder but still doubt why he had switched his mobile phone off between 3pm and 5pm — the likely time of the murder. Cops said Tapan was at Kidderpore for a collection and it has been verified. Police are likely to question him again on several aspects, including why the windows of the flat were shut all through the morning, why he did not take the flat keys with him, why his phone was switched off for a couple of hours and why he began calling up neighbours enquiring about his wife though he claimed that the main door of the flat was not locked. Police are also trying to find out if there was tension in the house after his wife gave up her job as a teacher during the lockdown. “It is wrong to see him as an accused right away. He might have a few important answers, though,” said a police officer. Susmita’s father refused to blame Tapan. “I have nothing against him at this moment. I still believe that an outsider is involved,” he said on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the postmortem report and the call record of Susmita’s missing mobile (along with that of Tapan) will hold the key in building up technical evidence. Both the victims had several wounds on them. These are marks no professional killer would usually leave behind, said a cop. “The entry was friendly, including the main gate of the flat that was open. The two of them were found dead in two separate rooms. It means they did not get the chance to raise an alarm, which happens when the killer is known to you or someone you trust,” said a police source. The cops have drawn up a list of a dozen-odd persons who had access to the house. Cops are likely to call them to Lalbazar and record their statements. One of them will be the private tutor of Tamojit, who, cops believe was the first to reach the house after the twin murders. “The main collapsible gate to the apartment would sometimes be locked and sometimes left open. On Monday, it was open. I reached the flat between 5.15pm and 5.30pm. I rang the bell thrice. There was no answer and I knocked on the door. Still there was no answer. I called on the mobile number they gave me and it said the phone was out of network area,” he said. TOI spoke to a neighbour, Bijon Roy, who said all windows of the flat were closed during the day. “I had spoken to Susmita a few times, but I was close to Tamojit. We spoke from the balcony. He had expressed his wish to be an IAS officer even on Sunday,” said Roy.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/police-bank-on-tech-evidence-to-crack-behala-double-murder-case/articleshow/86048403.cms||Dwaipayan Ghosh
---||Surat||Three nabbed for forging papers to change name in Aadhaar card||Surat: Police arrested three persons for allegedly forging documents and using them to change the name of a woman in Aadhaar card on Wednesday. Police arrested Ajay Gaud, Pankaj Maurya and Santosh Maurya, all residents of Pandesara, for allegedly making forged documents and using it as real.  The complaint was lodged by a police officer in Adajan police station on Tuesday. Gaud is the woman’s husband whose name was changed in Aadhaar records using forged documents. Gaud wanted to change his wife Tabassum Khatun’s name as he thought that her Muslim identity may create hurdles in her getting benefits of government schemes for pregnant woman. Police investigation revealed that Gaud, a labourer, was earlier working in Mumbai when he developed online friendship with Tabassum of West Bengal. They later met in Kolkata and planned to get married. They got married in a temple and started living together. Later, Gaud shifted to the city with Tabassum and the couple started living in the Pandesara area. “Meanwhile the woman became pregnant and Gaud felt that he may face difficulty in getting benefits of government scheme for pregnant woman due to Muslim name of his wife. For change of name and religion he was required to follow a detailed procedure which would have taken several months,” said a police officer at Adajan police station. “To bypass all the procedures he planned to get her name changed to Rani in the Aadhaar card. He contacted Pankaj who agreed to do this for Rs 1,100,” said police. Later Pankaj approached Santosh, who forged identity documents of Tabassum. Later, they used the forged documents to apply for a change of name at an Aadhaar card centre in Adajan. The issue came to the notice of the police who then lodged a complaint against the accused.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/surat/three-nabbed-for-forging-papers-to-change-name-in-aadhaar-card/articleshow/86046429.cms||---

Even the defect liability period of all tar roads has ended, he said.Pohekar also pointed out that the civic body had not undertaken any road works in the last three years.The NMC’s hotmix department could not repair all the potholes alone, said the chief engineer. “The department will hire private agencies for filling the potholes,” he added.Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B said due to the pandemic, the state government had stalled all development works and hence NMC could not take up tarring work.Mayor Dayashankar Tiwari countered the civic chief and said pothole repair works should come under maintenance head. “Due to misinterpretation of the government’s notification, condition of city roads has deteriorated with craters and potholes,” said the mayor. The civic chief said the administration has hired two private firms to repair potholes. “Bad tar roads will be asphalted as per availability of funds,” he said, adding the civic body’s financial condition has not improved yet.Ruling party leader Avinash Thakre said the administration should utilize unspent funds of other heads to re-carpet the roads.Congress corporator Harish Gwalbanshi drew the attention of the House to an NGO’s unique protest by naming the craters after elected representatives.Corporator Sandeep Jadhav raised the issue of other government agencies like NIT, NHAI and state PWD not maintaining roads under them. As a result, NMC is facing all the criticism, he said.Gwalbanshi said the NMC should either get the potholes repaired through the agencies at the earliest or repair on its own.Mayor directed the administration to ask other agencies to repair the roads under their jurisdiction or face action. Earlier, BSP corporator Vaishali Narnaware raised the issue of potholes in prabhag number 6 in North Nagpur. Despite complaints to the hotmix department, potholes were not repaired, she claimed. “Instead, the hotmix department submitted misleading statement declaring that potholes have been repaired,” she rued.Mayor directed the SE to verify Narnaware’s claims. He also ordered the SE to initiate action against executive engineer Kamlesh Chavan for giving misleading information, if the corporator’s claims are found to be true.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nmc-admits-40-increase-in-potholes-on-city-tar-roads/articleshow/86046393.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

---||Jaipur||Despite enough coal stock, Adani keeps plant shut||Jaipur: While the coal reserves at all power plants of Rajasthan Vidyut Utpadan Nigam (RVUNL) will last for a day or two, the Kawai plant of Adani Power Rajasthan Ltd, which has a reserve of over 61,000 tonnes as on September 7, is running only one 660MW unit. The Kawai plant has two units of 660MW each and has received over 10,000 tonnes of coal on an average over the past five days. But the second unit still remains shut, forcing discoms to buy costly power from energy exchanges. Queries to the company as to why the company is not restarting the second unit despite having coal did not elicit any response. The company had closed both the units, but restarted one unit only after some payment dues were cleared. “There was some outstanding payment issue which we have paid to a large extent. After that, Adani started the first unit. But the company says there are coal supply issues and assured us to start the second unit as well,” said state energy minister B D Kalla. As per estimates, the company requires 14,300 tonnes of coal to run both the units which have a total capacity to produce 1,320MW. The plant has been receiving over 10,000 tonnes in the past one week and also has a stock of 61,650 tonnes. Recently, the energy department had written to the company to start the plants, keeping in view the power shortage in the state due to payment issues to coal suppliers and also rains. Kalla, who met coal minister Pralhad Joshi on Tuesday, said the Centre would take measures to ensure regular supply of coal for smooth running of the plants. “The minister also assured me that the biodiversity clearance will be expeditiously given to the coal block in Chhattisgarh allotted to us so that Rajasthan can get 9-10 rakes of coal regularly (one rake can carry 4,000 tonnes). When it happens, we will not have any coal shortage issue,” said Kalla. He blamed the previous BJP government for non-payment of dues by discoms to RVUNL. “There were dues of Rs 20,000 crore to the RVUNL by discoms, and the previous government left the burden to us. Since then, it has been in debt,” the minister said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/despite-enough-coal-stock-adani-keeps-plant-shut/articleshow/86050943.cms||---

The boy would give Rs1,000 as a tip to each of his three friends whenever they sold the stolen ornament on his behalf to the jewellers. He used the rest of the money to foot his online gaming bills, bought costly cellphones, and partied away. He posted photos posing with the cash on online dating apps and on social networking sites. Senior inspector Shrihari Bahirat of the Khadak police said the boy and one of his detained friends are students of Std X while the other two friends are students of Std XII. Bahirat added that the theft came to light on August 30 when the boy’s mother, a housewife, realized while cleaning and rearranging the house that her ornaments were missing. “She checked which ornaments were missing and told her husband, who works with the dispatch section of a high-end luxury car manufacturing plant in Chakan,” he added. The boy’s father noticed a change in his son’s behaviour and questioned him about the missing ornaments. The boy then revealed the entire story, Bahirat said. Investigators have yet to recover the stolen ornaments and are looking at several jewellery shops in the old parts of the city where the ornaments were sold. Bahirat said, “The fathers of the three other boys also work in different companies in Pune city. These boys also spent the money on partying and buying electronic gadgets. The complainant’s son took many photographs with currency notes and uploaded them on various social networking sites. We are examining the boy’s phone to obtain more details about where he spent the money.” The stolen jewellery cost Rs4.16 lakh, but the jewellers paid the boys only half the amount. “We will identify these jewellery shops and take strong action against them,” he added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/teen-sells-moms-rs-4-16-lakh-jewellery-for-online-habits/articleshow/86050962.cms||Gitesh Shelke

Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B informed the general body meeting that the civic body has already approached the state government seeking its intervention in the matter.“If NIT terms NMC sanctioned layouts and building plans in Gunthewari layout illegal, the civic body will initiate legal action against it,” the civic chief told the House after BJP corporator Vijay Zalke raised the issue that infighting between NIT and NMC is causing problems for thousands of landowners in Gunthewari layouts.The meeting also gave its nod to entrust a private firm the job of towing away four-wheelers parked in no-parking zones. The initiative will be launched in association with Nagpur city police. NMC will get 10% of fees levied by the firm for towing away vehicles. Corporator Abha Pande demanded that the mayor deploy towing vans only after NMC designates parking zones in the city.The house also decided that NMC should maintain the 44 gardens developed by NIT. In 2020, the then civic chief Tukaram Mundhe had taken possession of the 44 NIT gardens. The house also gave its nod to return deposit money of shopkeepers of Railway Station flyover with 8.5% interest, which will cost NMC around Rs19.83 crore.Earlier, ruling party leader Avinash Thakre submitted an adjournment motion in the house over the 50% vacant posts in various NMC departments. According to him, NMC had 11,522 sanctioned posts in various departments. But 4,458 posts are lying vacant since years, and every month dozens of staffers are retiring, affecting civic services provided by NMC. He demanded the civic body should fill the vacant posts, as it would also help improve revenue and basic amenities.The mayor directed the administration to prepare a proposal to fill the vacant posts at the earliest and send the same to the state government for its nod. To a query raised by Pravin Datke, the mayor directed the house to recover dues from private advertisement agencies across the city. Datke has expressed anguish against the advertisement department for not taking action against advertisement agencies defaulting on dues of crores of rupees.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/nit-terms-bldg-plans-passed-by-nmc-as-illegal/articleshow/86046399.cms||Proshun Chakraborty

---||Lucknow||College teachers allowed to guide PhD students||Lucknow: The new academic session has some good news to offer to teachers working in degree colleges across the state. In fresh directives, the UP government has allowed teachers teaching undergraduate courses in colleges to mentor PhD students. So far, college teachers associated with post graduate courses were eligible for supervising research. As per the new arrangement, undergraduate teachers, who are regular and full-time and have five research papers published in referred journals, can work as research guides. The move is aimed at bringing uniformity among all colleges and universities in the state thus giving everyone a level-playing field. In addition, it will promote research among UG students. ACS, higher education, Monika S Gargstated that undergraduate teachers, who are eligible as research supervisors, can use resources available in nearby institutions, research and development labs to enhance the quality of their research work. Instructing universities to adopt a transparent process of selection of research supervisors from colleges, Garg in her order said the move will help in producing more quality researches from the state. The idea – to allow undergraduate college teachers as research supervisors -- was mooted during the meetings of task force constituted for implementation of the national education policy (NEP) 2020 which offers a degree with research under four-year undergraduate level if the student completes a stipulated research project. To deliberate on promoting research and fixing norms for teachers to supervise research, a committee led by basic education minister Satish Dwivedi with Monika S Garg as its member-secretary was formed in February. Officials said college teachers teaching UG students possess same qualification as their counterparts in universities and in fact understand local problems better thereby helping students take up innovative research projects.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/college-teachers-allowed-to-guide-phd-students/articleshow/86052299.cms||Isha Jain

---||Pune||Experts say screen time with endless gaming is addictive||Pune: It is a case of too much too soon, and the after-effects of a necessity gone wrong on many fronts ending up in addiction, and stealing to fuel it. A Pune-based teenager’s misadventure in disposing of his mother’s ornaments worth Rs 4.16 lakh to foot his online gaming bill, his purchase of smartphones, and partying, is an indication of the many ill-effects that students glued to smartphones, without activity, and confined to homes because of virtual education are now prone to. Counsellors and psychiatrists said cases of such addiction and the pitfalls were on the rise and they have been advising parents about how to act when they notice any such symptoms among children. Research suggests that internet addiction is often the result of high emotional loneliness. Experts said they have noticed increased addiction to online gaming, dating and social media platforms that was impacting youngsters at a time when the pandemic has led to prolonged shutdown of schools and colleges and most youngsters are spending time on their cellphones. Career counsellor Shreeram Geet said there has been an increase in such incidents steadily for the last 7-8 years. “But continuous and compulsory usage of cellphones have increased during the pandemic. Even studious students have lost their focus on tasks at hand. Several children need psychiatric treatment to begin with followed by psychological counseling.” Gulshan Gidwani, educator and former principal of the St Mira’s College for Women, said since outdoor activities have been almost nil for children during the pandemic. “Interpersonal activities and group activities on school and college premises have reduced to zero. The minds of the students need an outlet and it is sad that they seek it online and in such harmful ways,” she added.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/experts-say-screen-time-with-endless-gaming-is-addictive/articleshow/86050986.cms||Swati Shinde Gole

Sanjay Deshmukh, assistant director (medical), Pune circle, told TOI, “We are getting a consistent supply of vaccines this month, which has given a boost to the vaccination drive. Earlier this week, we received around 3.3 lakh Covishield and Covaxin doses. We are likely to receive a similar stock again in the next few days, which will eventually result in more mega vaccination drives, wherein over 500 government-run vaccination sites will be roped in.” Deshmukh said by 7pm on Wednesday, around 94,000 doses were administered across Pune district. But major increase in numbers was recorded in Satara and Solapur districts in Pune circle, where over 1.85 lakh shots were administered on Wednesday. The Pune circle of the health department comprises Pune, Satara and Solapur districts. Wednesday’s vaccination figures were the second-highest for the circle after 3.4 lakh doses administered on August 31. Pune district registered its second-highest vaccination figure of 1.85 lakh shots on Tuesday. “Satara recorded over 1.13 lakh shots, while Solapur recorded around 73,000 doses till 7pm on Wednesday, which are the highest single-day vaccination figures for both the districts,” said Deshmukh. He said after the back-to-back mega vaccination drives this week, the stock of Covishield and Covaxin had depleted and the fresh stock was likely to arrive on September 10. The Pune district administered 63 lakh doses as first shots and 23 lakh doses as second shots till Wednesday.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/more-mega-vax-drives-on-the-cards-this-month/articleshow/86050996.cms||Piyush Bhusari

Now, the deadline has been extended to December 31, 2021. The UGC had issued an order in this regard on March 16. Another order reiterating the same was later issued by Rajnish Jain, secretary of UGC, on September 2.For S Venkatesan, a part-time PhD candidate from a city college whose special extension by the ethics committee had ended in June, the order has come as a lifeline. He said he could not attend mandatory conferences and submit research papers in approved journals of the UGC on time because of the pandemic situation.While students like him are aware of the UGC guideline, many are unaware of the same and end up visiting the university to know further details and the possibility of an extension of deadline.“There is no communication on the BU website on any such extension by UGC. We are also not aware of how to get the extension ratified,” said another research scholar, requesting anonymity.

The study, done in 41 such homes, revealed that 60% of the elderly had depression associated with eye and ear impairments. According to Dr Srinivas Marmamula, associate director of Public Health Research and Training, “Elderly people with double sensory impairment are five times more at risk for depression. In addition, depression is higher among those with single sensory impairment than in those without any sensory impairment.” ‘Nature Journal’ published the study in its recent edition titled ‘Depression, combined visual and hearing impairment (dual sensory impairment): A hidden multi-morbidity among the elderly in residential care in India.’ Dr Srinivas told TOI, “This is one of the most extensive studies carried out among the elderly population in the residential care area. Visual and hearing problems and feeling of loneliness drive the elderly into depression. Other health and psychosocial issues and emotional factors are also contributing factors for depression.” Researchers did not find any link between hypertension or diabetes and depression. However, they identified poor mobility as another factor. In addition, researchers said that six out of 10 elderly diagnosed with both ear and eye impairments had depression and highlighted the need for screening and referral for medical care. LVPEI’s earlier studies have found that close to a third of the elderly had visual impairment. Out of them, over 80% of visual impairment cases were due to avoidable causes. The elderly homes ere classified into three categories. The first category is private homes where the elderly or their kin pay a monthly or annual user fee. The second category is artially subsidised homes where the elderly or their kin pay only a part of the user fee and the rest of the amount is met by philanthropic support. Finally, free homes where the elderly need not pay any user fee as external funding sources support the homes. The number of elderly residents ranges from less than 30 to over 100 in these homes. Researchers observed that clinical assessment of depression should be done as part of the routine practice in India’s eye and ear examination clinics.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/one-in-four-elderly-suffering-from-depression-finds-study/articleshow/86050990.cms||U Sudhakar Reddy

The residents said they had made several representations to the city corporation to relay the road, but to no avail.G Vennila, a local resident, confirmed that the condition of the road would be pathetic during rain. “Corporation officials haven’t given us a proper explanation for the inordinate delay in relaying the road.”The condition of Perks Arch Road isn’t any different. P Kamalakannan, a resident of Uppiliyapalayam, said the road was dug for underground drainage work a year ago. “The work started in July 2020 and it was completed in two months. But the civic body hasn’t yet relaid the road.”M Devendran, secretary, Coimbatore District Roads Protection Association, said at least a few stretches in most of the corporation wards were in bad condition following the underground drainage and drinking water pipeline laying work. “We had passed several resolutions at our association meetings and sent them to corporation officials. But nothing has changed on the ground.”According to him, a drainage ditch was creating hardship for commuters in ward 41. “After taking up the issue with the civic body several times, the issue finally resolved on Tuesday. We had threatened the civic body to seek alms from commuters to address the issue, if it didn’t intervene.”A corporation official said the damaged roads would be relaid soon. “Many roads have to be relayed and we had invited tenders a few months ago and fixed contractors. But the tenders were recently cancelled because of the inordinate delay from the part of contractors in relaying the roads.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/roads-damaged-during-civil-works-in-city-corporation-limits-yet-to-be-relaid/articleshow/86050982.cms||---
---||Coimbatore||Nipah virus: Pig rearers, pork stall owners in Coimbatore put on high alert||COIMBATORE: Health officials in the district are on a drive to create awareness among pork stall owners and the people who rear pigs on the need to take precautions to keep Nipah virus at bay. The virus had recently resurfaced in neighbouring Kerala. The officials said while animals such as dogs, cats, horses and goats could become carriers of the virus, pigs had higher chances of getting infected with the virus, as they were mainly fed rotten fruits. “Fruit eating bats are major carriers of Nipah virus. Pigs have chances of contracting the virus if they eat the fruits bit by bats.” A corporation health official said there were a number of pig farms on the outskirts of the city and many pork stalls in the city as well as rural areas. “We have asked them to be extra cautious and report if pigs develop some diseases. The virus can spread to humans when they come in close contact with the infected animal. It mainly spreads through body fluids like nasal or respiratory droplets, urine or blood.” The official said butchers too had to be very careful. “They have to compulsorily wear face masks and aprons to minimize the chances of contracting the virus.” According to another health official, in countries such as Malaysia and Bangladesh, where Nipah outbreak was frequently noticed, spread mainly occurred through pigs. “People there had resorted to culling a large number of pigs to contain the spread.” He also advised against consuming palm sap, as there was a chance of it getting mixed with the urine of an infected bird. “However, there is no need to panic, as the virus outbreak is reported only in Kerala.” Collector G S Sameeran, meanwhile, said the local bodies were instructed to take all precautionary measures to prevent a Nipah outbreak in the district.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/nipah-pig-rearers-pork-stall-owners-put-on-high-alert/articleshow/86050971.cms||V Devanathan

The PMC has to make sure that it is looking after the spring. This is a mandate given to them by the Constitution,” said Vaishali Patkar of Bhujal Abhiyan. As per the environmentalists, three leading government bodies for water conservation and water supply management — Maharashtra Water Resources Regularization Authority, Ground Water Survey and Development Authority and Sub-Divisional office — have declared the spring in Bavdhan as a natural resource. The officials of these organizations had visited the spot and confirmed the presence of natural water resource at the location. “The panels have given directives to the PMC for issuance of notification. The demarcation of the spring and areas around it should be done and published as per the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act soon. The delay in publication may lead to contempt of the orders of these organisations,” said Suneel Joshi of Samagra Nadi Parivar.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/letter-to-pmc-to-protect-bavdhan-spring/articleshow/86051007.cms||---
---||Delhi||Migratory birds find second home at Delhi University college||NEW DELHI: Avian species like the red-naped ibis and white-throated kingfisher and migratory species like the Taiga flycatcher and grey-headed canary flycatcher besides the native residents such as the spotted owl and shikra were among the 53 winged visitors at Indraprastha College for Women when the institution’s Centre for Earth Studies stepped out to record their presence as part of the Bird Diversity Census. The college campus located in north Delhi was probably able to log so many species because its area of 21 acres has plenty of open green spaces, which the college has cultivated further by planting an array of flowering plants and shrubs and fruit trees. The count proved to the Centre for Earth Studies that “green patches in the middle of an urban landscape not only improves the ecology of a city, but also allows space for the bird population to flourish”. Anindita Roy Saha, centre co-ordinator, said, “With the Yamuna on one side and the North Delhi Ridge on the other, the IPC College campus is a habitat island that hosts numerous species of birds, butterflies, dragonflies, etc., maintaining a healthy food chain within this micro-ecosystem. It is home to a large variety of birds ranging from species of the woodlands, open areas and wetlands, seasonal and migratory.” TimesViewThe students and authorities at IP College must be lauded for this eco-friendly initiative. Other schools and colleges, especially those with huge campuses, can well follow their path.Saha pointed out that as Delhi had undergone rapid urbanisation over the course of the past few decades, the available habitat for bird species such as natural forests and wetlands had also declined. This was the reason why urban patches, like the one at IP College, were so important. She said such habitat islands could be created by planting big trees like neem, Ashok and mango, with smaller and fast-growing trees and shrubs that act as excellent habitat for birds. “Studying urban biodiversity provides valuable insights into the conservation of remnant habitat patches,” said the coordinator. “Birds, because of their popularity, ease of observation and ecosystem services, have the potential to play a crucial role in directing perceptions and policies about urban development.” The avian occupancy on the campus involved three-year-long, multi-season monitoring. “The variety of bird species sighted on the campus is amazing,” exclaimed Saha. “Species such as the red-naped ibis and white-throated kingfisher are not very commonly seen in urban areas but are frequent visitors to the campus. Due to the proximity to the Yamuna khadar, riverine species like red-wattled lapwings can sometimes be seen nesting on the campus.” Project coordinator Nawin K. Tiwary, a trained ornithologist, added, “Birds are the most easily perceivable life forms in cities. They can be seen from our balconies, in parks and gardens and even by the roadsides. Bird sounds and sightings provide us with the much-needed feeling of closeness to nature in this multi-dimensional urban matrix.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/migratory-birds-find-second-home-at-du-college/articleshow/86048450.cms||Shradha Chettri

The PCMC officials said that the unit will be shut by September 15, but will remain on standby mode. The officials said that around 90 patients are under care at the unit, of whom 60 are critical. If these patients do not recover by September 15, they will be shifted to the Akurdi and Thergaon civic hospitals. The Akurdi and Thergaon hospitals were recently upgraded with ICU beds and ventilator support. These hospitals also have their own dedicated oxygen generation plants, said municipal commissioner Rajesh Patil. Patil said they are in the process of appointing a private firm for looking after the ICU facilities at these hospitals, which will be used as an alternative for the jumbo unit. Asked if the same firms will look after the jumbo facility as well, he said that for the jumbo unit a different firm will continue to work. Meanwhile, officials from the MedBros agency, which looks after the unit, said that since resumption of the unit in March 2021, they have been paid only for March-April period, while their payment from May to August is still pending with the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation. Asked about the matter, commissioner Patil said that they are processing the bills of the unit and the payment is likely to be cleared in the next few days. The unit has catered to 4,995 patients since resumption of operation. Altogether 3,573 were discharged after recovery, while 1,331 patients succumbed to the contagion.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pcmc-stops-new-admission-at-magar-jumbo-unit/articleshow/86050979.cms||Piyush Bhusari
---||Kolkata||West Bengal: From December, go online for all car permit issues||KOLKATA: The state transport department is all set for a complete switch to online registration of vehicles and issuance, renewal and transfer of permits. The system is scheduled to be operational from December 1. “The new system will help operators of transport vehicles get their permit applications submitted and processed more easily online. Also, they will be spared of the harassment by touts,” said a transport department official. The online process will be seamless and can be operated from the comfort of home, he added. The online permit issuance and vehicle registration is part of the Vahan4 portal, which has brought uniformity in the process across the country. “The permit issuance, renewal and transfer had been an offline process. Our technical team is working hard to integrate it with Vahan4,” said an officer. The state government has already switched to a complete online vehicle registration system across the state. This has not only helped the buyer purchase a vehicle without any hitch but also helped dealers to avoid coming to RTOs.  “We have managed to reduce footfall at RTOs significantly. With the shift to the online permit system, the footfall is to drop further, enabling us to focus more on enforcement,” said a senior transport department officer. “Our experience with the process of permit renewal has been very bitter. Without touts, it was impossible to lay hands on a new permit or renew an old one. Hopefully, with the online system, we will get rid of touts,” said Tapan Banerjee, secretary of the Joint Council of Bus Syndicates. Hitherto, an operator needed to be physically present at RTOs and stand in a queue to deposit cash and then submit the form. “It was not only time-consuming, there was no end to harassment with touts fleecing applicants at every step. We hope all will end with the online process,” said Titu Saha, general secretary of suburban bus service. Section 66 of Motor Vehicle Act, 1988, mandates the necessity of permit to transport vehicles. However, transport vehicles of central or state governments, police, fire brigade, ambulance, cranes and goods vehicle having gross vehicle weight not exceeding 3000kgs are exempted from the necessity of having a permit.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/from-dec-go-online-for-all-car-permit-issues/articleshow/86048422.cms||Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay
---||Hyderabad||Telangana: Schools in a fix as students, teachers testing Covid positive on rise||HYDERABAD: It’s been just over a week since educational institutions resumed physical classes, but already about 15-20 students and teachers have tested positive for Covid-19. Teachers said the numbers are likely to be higher as several students with Covid-like symptoms have been missing school. The school education department, however, has failed to confirm the total number of positive cases from schools in the state since physical classes began on September 1. With worry over fresh spike in cases, teachers said that many missing students with symptoms similar to Covid are either not getting tested or not revealing their test results. “Students only tell us that they are down with fever. They are not revealing whether it is Covid-19. But as positive cases are rising in schools, we need to be extra careful,” said a government teacher. In the last one week, at least five teachers and five students have been infected in Bhadradri Kothagudem and Mulugu district, while another two teachers from Mulugu tested positive on Tuesday. “We have tested 56 students who are immediate contacts of the two teachers who tested positive on Tuesday, but none of them tested positive,” said Appaiah A, district medical and health officer, Mulugu, adding that till date five teachers have been infected. He said that after positive cases were reported, they organised an awareness programme on Covid-appropriate behaviour. Headmaster and teachers were also told to go for a shift system or divide a class into two if the strength was around 40. While about 53 lakh students are enrolled in over 37,000 schools in the state, another 10 lakh students are studying in junior colleges. The attendance has been poor in both schools and junior colleges at about 30% to 35%. Teachers working at government schools in the city said that they have received instructions from officials that only vaccinated staff would be allowed to report to work. According to them, most teachers have already been vaccinated.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/schools-in-a-fix-as-studentsteachers-testing-ve-on-rise/articleshow/86051026.cms||Nirupa Vatyam
---||Pune||Will finish gang-rape probe within 60 days: Pune CP||Pune: City police commissioner Amitabh Gupta on Wednesday said the probe into the kidnapping and gang-rape of a 14-year-old girl in and around the Pune railway station would be completed within 60 days. He said the city police would request the state government to appoint a special public prosecutor in the trial. “We will also request the special court, which will preside over the case hearing, to see that the trial takes very less time,” Gupta told reporters. The Wanowrie police had on Sunday night arrested eight of the 14 men suspected to have gang-raped a 14-year-old girl at various locations in and around the Pune railway station between August 31 and September 1. Six of the arrested men are autorickshaw drivers, while the other two are Class IV railway employees. On Tuesday, the police arrested six more men — five autorickshaw drivers and a person known to the girl — in connection with the crime. Gupta said,“We will now question the owner and staff of the lodge, where the girl was traumatised, to see what procedure they followed while renting out the room. We will check if the name of the autorickshaw driver, who had taken the girl to the lodge, was registered in the facility and documents were used for the process. We will take action against the lodge based on the outcome of the probe.”  Gupta said, “There have been four gang-rape cases — one each in Hadapsar, Swargate, Dattawadi and Wanowrie — so far this year, while 129 rape cases have been registered. We have arrested the suspects.” Profiling of autorickshaw drivers on the cards Police commissioner Amitabh Gupta on Wednesday said an elaborate exercise would be carried out to create a profile of every auto-rickshaw driver operating in the city . “Around 82,000 autorickshaws operate in the city and 42,000 of these are enrolled with the regional transport office (RTO),” he said, added that traffic police personnel would visit each autorickshaw stand to secure details such as the auto drivers’ name, age, address, photo, area of operation and working hours. “The idea is to ensure that they have the feeling of being constantly under watch. We are planning things in a systematic manner to ensure that passengers feel safe while travelling. We will also sensitise the autorickshaw drivers to ensure that they respect women,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/will-finish-gang-rape-probe-within-60-days-pune-cp/articleshow/86051033.cms||Asseem Shaikh

The union has also challenged the Essential Defence Services Act (EDSA). The law, enacted soon after talks between the ordnance factory unions and government failed, makes strike in defence establishments illegal. Both the cases have been filed by the AIDEF in the Madras high court.In a day, the Bharatiya Pratiraksha Mazdoor Sangh (BPMS), an RSS-leaning union, is expected to file a case against EDSA in the Delhi high court.Amid this, the Indian Ordnance Factories Services (IOFS) Officers’ Association has filed a case on Wednesday challenging the very method of appointment of top management officials, including chairman-cum-managing directors (CMDs) and directors of the new corporations. Under the corporatization plan, seven public sector corporations have been carved out of the OFB. The association has made secretary, defence production, ministry of corporate affairs, director general OFB and all those selected for the post of CMDs and directors as respondents. The Delhi high court has served notices to the respondents.The union sources said there are a number of issues which have led to the contention. The officers’ association has alleged that none of the procedures, either laid down by the Union Public Services Commission (UPSC) or the Public Enterprises Selection Board (PESB), have been followed in selection process.An association source alleged that the age criterion was abruptly changed. The change was not publicly notified, but candidates were sent e-mails, he said. “Representations of some of the officers seeking clarifications were disposed of without any reply,” said the source, adding some of the candidates did not even get interview call. All these points will be raised during the litigation, said the source. “In some cases, there are issues related to vigilance too,” said an association source, requesting anonymity.The union’s contention against corporatization is that there already have been agreements with earlier defence minister that the OFB will not be corporatized. The unions say it has even been mentioned in the Parliament that idle capacity of the ordnance factories need to be maintained to meet any exigency. The factories may not be financially viable as a business corporation.EDSA is being challenged citing strike is the constitutional right of ordnance factory workers. They are covered under the Industrial Disputes Act and can go on a strike after following certain procedures.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/of-corporatization-selection-of-bosses-challenged-in-hc/articleshow/86048467.cms||Shishir Arya

Now, the number of people has reduced to seven this year.”Kannan is the fourth generation in his family to make Vinayagar idols for the Chaturthi festival.He used to make mud idols with the sizes ranging from half-ft to 3ft. He uses ‘paper mache pulp’ for making the idols starting from 3ft up to 15ft.“Members in our association will make Vinayagar idols based on the state government's guidelines and they will not violate it,” he said.According to Kannan, the Vinayagar idol makers used to clock a business of Rs 1 crore in Salem district alone. “We could not make business in 2020 and this year too,” he said, adding that most of the idol makers did not make any new idols and they were selling their old stock this year.Kannan thanked chief minister M K Stalin for announcing Rs 5,000 as interim relief to mud pot makers for not making expected business during Vinayagar Chaturthi festival. “When comparing our expectations, the interim relief is nothing. At the same time, we thank the CM for announcing that amount,” he said.Each idol maker usually makes at least 4,000 small idols to be used at houses and 500 big idols to be installed at public places. “This year, I have made only 2,000 small idols and did not make big idols,” he said, adding that last year he faced a loss of Rs 5 lakh by making the big sized idols. “We could not use the big sized idols like mud idols and all the big sized idols would become powder within six months of time,” he added.The idol makers expect good business at least next year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/idol-makers-stare-at-huge-financial-losses/articleshow/86051002.cms||---

It was later that she discovered her Rs 80,000 mobile phone was missing from her handbag. The thief, a history-sheeter, was tracked down to Dharavi. Turns out other passengers had seen him fiddling with the woman’s handbag and had mistaken him for a molester. The accused managed to slip out of the train at the time but couldn’t get away from the long arm of the law eventually. Meenakshi Gayatonde (25) works with a corporate hospital in Mahim. She entered the first-class general compartment of a Churchgate slow local on Sunday to go to work around 9.15am. After the train left Bandra station, she got up from her seat and stood near the door as she had to get off at Mahim station. Her wireless bluetooth set was plugged into her ears as she was listening to some music. Just before she was to get off, a scuffle broke out between two passengers and a man who appeared to be a miscreant. “I was in a rush to alight and couldn’t find out the reason. On the platform, a woman commuter gestured at me to check my handbag. My bluetooth set was still playing music. While I was rummaging in my handbag, the train left and the music stopped playing. That’s when I realised that my iPhone was missing,” Gayatonde said. She then approached the Mumbai Central GRP and registered a complaint. Police went through CCTV footage of Mahim and found that the man standing behind her in the coach had picked her iPhone out of her bag. “But other passengers presumed he was trying to sexually harass me and picked up a fight with him. Later he hopped into another train and then slipped out to Mahim West,” Gayatonde said. “After getting his images on CCTV, we formed special teams and nabbed the accused, Anil Chalwadi (32) within a day. He lives in Matunga Labour Camp and has 14 past offences registered in the railways and the city,” said senior inspector Mehboob Inamdar. Gayatonde said she was overjoyed to learn that the cops had recovered her phone so quickly and posted images on social media expressing her appreciation.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-rs-80k-phone-thief-on-train-mistaken-for-molester-held-later/articleshow/86051042.cms||Nitasha Natu

---||Bhubaneswar||Sub-inspectors recruitment panel to take over pending work from Odisha Staff Selection Commission||BHUBANESWAR: The recently constituted Odisha Police Recruitment Board (OPRB) will not just make fresh recruitments of sub-inspectors (SI) this year, but has also been asked by the government to take over the pending 2018 and 2019 work from the Odisha Staff Selection Commission (OSSC). The OSSC had been conducting the SI recruitments since 1994. After 27 years, the state government formed the OPRB to recruit SIs owing to the OSSC’s failure and inordinate delay in holding the exams on time. The OSSC has not yet completed the SI recruitments, the advertisements of which were published in 2017, 2018 and 2019. In fact, the OSSC itself recently proposed to the government to hand over the charge of the pending recruitments to the OPRB. “We will make the SI recruitments for the 2017 batch. We had already conducted the written test. But the subsequent phases of the examinations were delayed owing to certain technical issues, including the Covid-19 pandemic. We will complete the 2017 recruitment. Since we could not start the recruitment process for the 2018 and 2019 batches, the OPRB will now hold their tests,” OSSC’s chairman Nirmal Chandra Mishra told TOI. The OPRB, which was preparing to conduct the 2021 SI recruitment, will soon come up with the exam dates for the applicants, who had applied in 2018 and 2019. “We have asked the OSSC to share the details of the applicants of the two previous years. We will first complete the recruitment of the 2018 and 2019 batches before holding the 2021 tests,” a senior OPRB official said. The OPRB had tentatively planned to hold the tests of the SI aspirants of the 2021 batch between August 8 and 16. However, the pending recruitments cast a shadow on the fresh ones. Unlike the OSSC recruitment procedure, which used to involve several rounds of tests, the new exam patterns framed by the OPRB aim to expedite the selection of the SIs. For the first time, the board has introduced technology in the appointment process. The applicants would be asked to write the papers through computer-based recruitment examination. Viva voce has been done away with. The SIs would be selected following written and physical tests.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/si-recruitment-panel-to-take-over-pending-work-from-ossc/articleshow/86050536.cms||Debabrata Mohapatra

For the second year in a row, The Times of India has launched its online Times Bappa initiative during Ganeshotsav. The website encourages devotees to celebrate the festival in the safety and comfort of their homes amid the pandemic. Last year after the emergence of Covid-19, public Ganeshotsav festivities were curtailed. So The Times of India devised an innovative way of celebrating with its readers. The new Times Bappa initiative was well received with more than 1.2 lakh users interacting on the website. Now that public darshan is banned in pandals across the state this season too, the ‘Times Bappa’ initiative has been significantly scaled up by adding interactive sections and engaging contests. What makes www.TimesBappa.com so popular is that it allows people to harness their creativity. Users can create and customize their own Ganpati using various options of idols, backgrounds, lights, decor, sweets, flowers and fruits. The finished tableau can be shared with friends and family via Whatsapp, Facebook and Twitter. In fact they can be encouraged to vote for your design and increase your chances of winning prizes. Multiple Bappa creations can be designed. The idol’s decoration can be changed every day. Several new contests have been added this year. For instance the ‘Selfie with Bappa’ section lets users click a selfie with their idol, submit the entry for this contest and get votes. One can also prepare a painting or drawing of Ganesha, submit the original artworks and get votes. There is a special contest only for Ganesh pandals where they share the current year’s image of Bappa with all details and get votes.

---||Pune||Increase in road accident deaths, injuries in Pune limits||PUNE: The number of deaths and injuries due to road accidents in the city has increased this year because of a combination of factors such as the relaxation of curbs, addition of highway stretches from merged villages and vehicles over speeding. As many as 145 accident deaths were reported between January and August this year as against 143 deaths recorded in 2020. The city had recorded as many as 206 road accident deaths in 2019. Deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Rahul Shrirame said the figures so far this year are high partly on account of the merger of the Lonikand and Loni Kalbhor police stations with the city police limits. “A majority of the road fatalities occurred on the Pune-Solapur and Pune-Ahmednagar highways and the Katraj-Dehu Road bypass,” said Shrirame. According to Shrirame, the city in the past eight months witnessed at least 140 accidents in which 145 motorists died. “In some accidents, there were multiple deaths. A majority of the casualties were two-wheeler riders;as many as 90 people riding two-wheelers died,” said Shrirame. “In the corresponding eight-month period last year, 95 persons were reported dead in accidents on the city roads,” said the police officer. Referring to the busy Katraj-Dehu road bypass and the two major highway stretches, Shrirame said over speeding is an issue and thus the number of fatalities on these stretches is higher. “Lonikand has reported 19 fatalities on the Pune-Ahmednagar highway while Loni Kalbhor reported 16 fatalities on the Pune-Solapur highway,” Shrirame said. “Similarly, 30 people died on the Katraj-Dehu road bypass, especially in areas such as Bharati Vidyapeeth, Sinhagad road and Warje, while the Katraj-Kondhwa road has witnessed eight fatalities,” he said. “Also, a section of the Pune-Ahmednagar Road from Yerawada to Kharadi has witnessed 13 fatalities,” he said. “Sections of the Pune-Solapur highway and the Pune-Saswad highway in Hadapsar recorded a total of 15 fatalities,” he said. According to the traffic police, the parts of the old city did not witness any major accidents.  The areas of Faraskhana, Khadak and Deccan did not witness any casualties. Similarly, were no fatal accidents in the areas of the Cantonment.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/increase-in-road-accident-deaths-injuries-in-city-limits/articleshow/86051049.cms||Gitesh Shelke
---||Delhi||Delhi: Conman who duped telecom firm of nearly Rs 1.8 crore arrested after 11 years||NEW DELHI: After playing a game of cat and mouse with police for over 11 years, conman Chitresh Mohan Sharma, who allegedly went underground after duping Aircel telecom firm, has been arrested by the Economic Offences Wing of Delhi Police. The 36-year-old Sharma ran an export firm and had taken multiple mobile connections in the name of a ghost employee, Deepak Rawat. Later, he got international roaming activated on them and raised a bill of about Rs 1.8 crore. The fraud came to fore when Aircel received information from Nepal Telecom that some people were incurring very high usage from Nepal on international roaming. Sharma was arrested from Jaitpur area on Tuesday following raids at several locations. He was declared a proclaimed person (absconder) by a court in 2017, the police said. Additional commissioner of police (EOW) R K Singh said that in January 2010, an Aircel representative made a complaint against Rawat, who claimed to be running a company named LA Bella Export and Import Ltd. According to the complaint, Rawat got 10 mobile connections using fake ID proofs and he used them for making international roaming calls worth about Rs 1.8 crore. “During investigation, it was revealed that 10 postpaid numbers were issued in the name of Deepak Rawat,” Singh said. “After some time, Aircel received information from Nepal Telecom that some people are utilising international roaming facility from Nepal with very high usage,” he added. “Investigation could not establish the identity of Deepak Rawat as documents provided in his name were all fake. Later on, minute scrutiny of documents revealed that there was no entity in the name of Deepak Rawat and the present accused, Sharma, was the man posing as Deepak Rawat. He was absconding and later on declared a proclaimed person,” said a senior police officer. Sharma has been found involved in two other similar cases, the officer said. The investigation revealed that calls from these sim cards were routed through Nepal to the USA and Maldives, the police said. Cops are investigating who were the recipient of these calls and whether the numbers were used for illegal purposes. Sharma’s links and background are being investigated as well.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/run-ends-conman-who-duped-telecom-firm-of-nearly-rs-1-8cr-arrested-after-11-yrs/articleshow/86051101.cms||---

Police have arrested 14 people, including 11 autorickshaw drivers, in connection with the crime. A Pune Regional Transport Office (RTO) representative said the drive would be stringent and primarily focus on the autorickshaw drivers’ behavioural aspect and if they had the permit and badge to operate. “The drive will start soon and we are in talks with the autorickshaw unions. The drivers should wear the uniform and carry the badges issued by the RTO. Our inspectors will check the autorickshaw drivers’ behaviour and how they interact with the commuters in general and women and senior citizens in particular. Fines will be imposed and challans issued against the autorickshaw drivers found flouting norms,” an RTO official told TOI. Over 1 lakh autorickshaw drivers operate in the PMC and PCMC limits. “Online character certificates are issued by the police and we can check it by scanning the QR code of the documents. Once the person gets the badge, s/he can apply for a permit to drive an autorickshaw,” another RTO official said. “The administration should look into the root of the problem,” said Nitin Pawar, convener of the Rickshaw Panchayat.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/rto-ready-for-drive-againsterrant-autorckshaw-drivers/articleshow/86051069.cms||Joy Sengupta
---||Kolkata||Sumati international arrival||Kolkata: Keeping in mind the new variants of SARS-CoV-2, all international flyers arriving in the state who test positive on arrival will be under hospital observation even if they have only mild symptoms. The decision was taken on Tuesday during a meeting at Swasthya Bhavan to decide the new protocol for international travellers in the wake of emerging variants, especially Mu. The health department has also identified Infectious Diseases & Beliaghata General Hospital (ID&BG) for admission of such patients. But those testing positive will also have the option of getting admitted in a private hospital. They, however, will have to quarantine abd follow strict quarantine rules till their RT-PCR test confirms a negative report. “International passengers coming from seven particular countries will have to undergo RT-PCR for Covid on arrival in Kolkata, irrespective of negative test report before boarding or completion of vaccination, as per MOHFW directive. It is similar to what is already being done with passengers from/transiting through UK or Brazil,” said director health services Ajay Chakraborty. The newly added countries are New Zealand, Mauritius, Zimbabwe, Botswana, China, Bangladesh and South Africa. “If anyone is found positive on arrival, the usual protocol of admitting them in ID&BG or a private hospital of their choice and other protocols like contract tracing and quarantine will follow,” said the DHS. Sources in the health department also said that the swab samples of positive flyers suspected for carrying the mutant virus would be sent for genomic sequencing. These flyers would be kept under strict quarantine before they test negative to the virus. Even as researchers said this latest mutant is not as ferocious as the delta variant as far as transmissibility is concerned, we need to keep a close tab on it. “Mu has mutations in critical sites that can help it escape immunity generated by vaccines or natural infection by earlier strains. But the fact that it is not that pervasive (for example as compared to delta) despite being around since January perhaps indicates that it's transmission efficiency is weaker than Delta. Although we have to keep in mind that it was first reported in South America and international travel touching its base was much less than that of delta. It seems it recently got an entry to South Korea. The coming days will be revealing more,” said immunologist Dipyaman Ganguly scientist at Indian Institute of Chemical Biology. Ends BOX International flyers if found testing positive on arrival in Kolkata will have to undergo institutional quarantine even if they have only mild symptom ID&BG hospital has been identified as the hospital for housing such positive flyers But they also have the option of choosing a private hospital where they will undergo strict quarantine rules If suspected of being infected by either a variant of concern or variant of interest their swab sample will be sent for genome sequencing Contract tracing and quarantine rules to come into being in case of a flyer is found positive||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/sumati-international-arrival/articleshow/86048535.cms||Sumati Yengkhom

---||Pune||Joint thermocol recycling initiative launched in Pune||PUNE: The city mayor, Murlidhar Mohol, on Tuesday launched a joint thermocol recycling initiative of the Pune Municipal Corporation, solid waste collection and handling (SWaCH) collective of wastepickers and KK Nag Private Limited. The city generates around 0.4 -0.5 tonne thermocol waste every day and the initiative plans to tackle this issue by ensuring end-to-end collection, helping reduce the burden on existing solid waste management systems. “Thermocol is a recyclable material used mainly for packaging. But, it is difficult to manage after the goods have been safely delivered. A 1,500kg garbage collection vehicle of the PMC can only carry around 50kg of thermocol. It is a waste of resources and increases expenditure. Looking at all of this, a 5-month pilot project was conducted in the city, where 7.83 tonne (7,830kg) of thermocol waste was collected. It saved 32 bulk-refuse-carriers’ trips to landfills, improving the efficiency of transport and saving money for the corporation. Pune will now have a sustainable thermocol recycling system in place,” said Harshad Bard, director of SWaCH Pune. SWaCH is engaging with citizens, training its wastepickers and PMC’s staff and monitoring the system for segregated handling of discarded thermocol. K K Nag Pvt Ltd is recycling all the thermocol at its own facility and reusing the material, said a statement issued by the company. “Our goal is to ensure that there is not a single piece of used thermocol litters the streets in the civic limits. We want to collect every piece, recycle it and give it a new lease of life while ensuring that our streets are clean,” said Milon K Nag, the chairman and managing director of K K Nag Pvt Ltd. Kunal Khemnar, PMC’s additional municipal commissioner, said the initiative would help save expenditure on transport and processing and also ensure thermocol was not seen on the streets of Pune.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/joint-thermocol-recycling-initiative-launched-in-pune/articleshow/86051067.cms||Ardhra Nair

Dr G Jagannath, consultant psychiatrist at Asha Hospital, said,“Those who live in elderly homes get distanced from children. Lack of vision and hearing issues are the prime reasons for depression. Psychological delusions, anxiety and insomnia also hit them. Due to loss of mobility, they cannot go to the toilet in the night especially.” Dr Jagannath said,“In some elderly homes, voluntary organisations reach out and engage them. Abandoned parents are most affected. These elderly homes mostly are tiny and run with meagre funds.”  “Better quality of life, love and care are what they need.

---||Mumbai||'Sachin Waze tried to convince Maharashtra CM that Mansukh Hiran took his own life'||MUMBAI: After the discovery of an explosive-laden vehicle near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence and the subsequent murder of its owner Mansukh Hiran, policeman Sachin Waze, who orchestrated the killing, tried to convince chief minister Uddhav Thackeray at a meeting that Hiran died by suicide, according to the statement of an assistant police commissioner (ACP) to the National Investigation Agency (NIA). After opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis criticised the government in assembly over the case, the CM had called a meeting on March 5. That’s where Waze tried to convince him that Hiran had died by suicide though the Anti-Terrorism Squad (which probed the case before the NIA took over) ruled out this theory, the ACP said. The ACP is among 200 witnesses who deposed before NIA. “In the VIP room at Varsha (chief minister’s residence), I saw ADG ATS chief Jaijeet Singh, ADG intelligence Ashutosh Dumbre and HM Sir (home minister)… In the meeting CM asked Waze about Antilia as well as the death of Hiran...Waze replied that there was no terror angle in Antilia and Hiran’s death appeared to be a case of suicide subject to final outcome of the post mortem proceedings. ADG Jaijeet Singh said that the terror angle cannot be ruled out…and that the real cause of death of Hiran shall be known only after getting the post mortem report,” he added. I saw Sachin Waze escorting Pradeep Sharma out of CP’s office: ACPThe NIA, in its chargesheet in the Antilia case and the subsequent murder of businessman Hiran Mansukh has claimed to have strong evidence of the role of dismissed sub-inspector Sachin Waze. Hiran, who refused to take the rap for planting the explosives, was allegedly killed in a moving vehicle and his body dumped in a creek on March 5. When an ACP and his team went to brief the then commissioner Param Bir Singh about the body’s recovery, they found Pradeep Sharma (former encounter specialist) leaving his cabin, the ACP said. The ACP said, “I was shocked to hear this news (Hiran's death). Waze appeared composed and told me that Hiran might have committed suicide due to pressure and left to meet CP. We along with DCP Prakash Jadhav went to Jt CP Milind Bharambe sir who was equally shocked and all three of us decided to meet CP. As I was entering the chamber…I saw ex-police officer Pradeep Sharma being escorted out…by Waze. Then four of us had a brief meeting with CP…CP Sir said that it was very unfortunate that Hiran committed suicide and that he shouldn’t have taken his life under pressure…on CP’s instruction we went to Thane to ascertain the facts. En route I received a call from Waze saying both of us have to brief the chief minister and asked me to reach Varsha Bungalow at Malabar Hill. I told them I am not carrying any case paper, Waze said that they have to brief CM orally.” Waze had told the ACP, who was assigned the case, that Hiran’s complaint of theft of the Scorpio had no substance. Before Hiran’s murder came to light, Waze even said he had told Hiran’s brother that Hiran may have switched off his phone due to stress. On March 5, when Hiran’s body was recovered, Waze got a call in which he spoke in monosyllables like “Yes”, “Oh”, “Okay,”, the ACP said. Afterwards Waze told the ACP about Hiran’s body being found in Thane creek, he said. A South Mumbai trader, another witness, has said he paid a bill of Rs 13 lakh for 100 nights at Oberoi for Waze, who promised to help him recover money in a cheating case. There are also statements by hoteliers who say on March 2 they came to deliver hafta to Waze and saw Hiran coming out of the office looking disturbed. A constable under inspector Sunil Mane said days prior to Hiran’s murder, Mane asked him if they had an iron rod. When asked why he needed it, Mane said he wanted to kill a gangster in an encounter. Another witness said Manish Soni who drove the Tavera in which Hiran was killed, was depressed and confided in him, “Mere se ek galti ho gay hai. (I’ve made a mistake)”. He was feeling guilty for driving the car in which his friend Shellar and others killed a man.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-i-saw-waze-escorting-pradeep-sharma-out-of-cps-office-acp/articleshow/86051185.cms||Ahmed Ali
---||Visakhapatnam||Inconsistent monsoon takes toll on Andhra Pradesh economy, ecology||VISAKHAPATNAM: Gone are the days where there would be continuous rains for a period of two to three months. Andhra Pradesh has been witnessing a strange climate phenomenon over the last few years – rainfall in a few heavy bursts and longer dry spells in between. This is despite the mean rainfall remaining in the same range. The inconsistent monsoon phenomenon carries many disturbing implications, including upsetting the prospects of farmers, depleting the groundwater levels, water crisis, lowered food produce, and having a negative impact on the ecology and economy too. While the dry spells may affect the growth and produce of the crops, the intense rains will damage the crops. The unpredictable monsoon patterns will also impact water availability in various reservoirs in the state. According to the official statistics, about 25 lakh hectare area was affected due to the droughts between 2016 and 2019 in Andhra Pradesh. According to experts, a variety of factors have been distorting the pressure belts during monsoons, including increasing temperatures, greenhouse gas emissions, rising sea levels, change in land-use pattern, pollution, etc. Former head of the department of meteorology and oceanography, Prof OSRU Bhanu Kumar, said that there has been a drop in the number of rainy days despite the annual average rainfall remaining more or less the same. “At the same time, there has been an increase in the intensity of wet spells. Even the number of weather systems forming in the sea like lows and depressions has reduced over the years,” said Prof Bhanu Kumar. Director of India Meteorological Department (IMD), Amaravati, S Stella, said that the rainy days vary from year to year based on the climatic patterns and weather systems. “There has been an excess of rainfall in the last two years. But, in general, the intense precipitation events have increased. The heavy rains would only lead more water runoff than the precipitation into the soil,” said Stella. According to agricultural officials, the distribution of rainfall over the months also counts in addition to the overall rainfall as far as agricultural output is concerned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/inconsistent-monsoon-takes-toll-on-ap-economy-ecology/articleshow/86057464.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

The woman had jumped off a building in an area under the Wanowrie police jurisdiction on February 7. A state cabinet minister, whose name had surfaced in the case, had to resign amid a strident campaign by state BJP leaders led by former CM Devendra Fadnavis. “We will continue to fight till we provide justice to the suicide victim’s family. We have filed a writ petition in the Bombay HC,” Wagh told reporters after meeting Pune police commissioner Amitabh Gupta and joint commissioner Ravindra Shisve in relation to the gang-rape case. “The gang-rape is shameful and shows a growing sense of perversion among the criminals,” she said. Wagh called for apt reforms in the justice delivery system to see that all pending cases of atrocities against women were expedited at the earliest. She said, “An expert committee should be set up to suggest such reforms and provisions to see that accused in such cases do not get bail.” She said, “The state government needs to change its attitude while dealing in cases relating to women. There is a dire need to sensitise people coming from lower strata of society, like autorickshaw drivers, to respect women and deter them from committing crime.” Wagh also praised the Chandigarh railway police for rescuing the girl. She said the Maharashtra police should intensify patrolling at railway stations and bus terminus to ensure safety of women.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bjp-to-fight-for-justice-for-suicide-victims-kin-wagh/articleshow/86051110.cms||Asseem Shaikh

A formal FIR was registered with the Airport Police Station. Patil said, “The victim’s father, a businessman, has been arrested by the Airport police in a cheating case. The victim was trying to obtain a bail for his father. In order to ‘help’ the victim in obtaining bail, the API demanded a bribe of Rs5 lakh from the victim. “However, the victim expressed his inability to pay Rs5 lakh and the API settled for Rs3lakh. On Wednesday afternoon, Khandve took a bribe of Rs1lakh as first instalment at the behest of the assistant police inspector when we nabbed them.”||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/api-held-on-charge-of-accepting-rs-1l-in-bribe/articleshow/86051099.cms||---

The government now plans to file a fresh application before the Uttarakhand high court to allow the yatra to be undertaken. On Tuesday, the state government had asked the Uttarakhand HC to vacate its stay on the Char Dham Yatra. Advocate general (AG) SN Babulkar appeared before the bench of chief justice RS Chauhan and Justice AK Verma to point out that the livelihoods of local residents have been affected and, therefore, the stay should be lifted. The bench, however, had said that a SLP is already before the SC and it cannot pass any order until the SLP is pending. Now, the state government will likely file a fresh application to conduct the 'yatra' this year.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/dehradun/char-dham-yatra-uttarakhand-govt-submits-application-in-sc/articleshow/86046498.cms||Mohammad Anab

State WCD minister Yashomati Thakur on Wednesday said the decision was taken against the backdrop of a possible third Covid wave. Recently, Covid cases were reported from the childcare institutions in Mankhurd (18) and Ulhasnagar (14). Thakur said all district collectors have been told to ensure that medical officers conduct these tests and immediately isolate children with symptoms. The district administration would have to earmark a dedicated Covid care centre for these children, she said. “These instructions were issued earlier also, but the recent cases make it mandatory for all collectors to ensure that medical teams are sent to these centres. The staff at these institutions should also be mandatorily vaccinated. Ahead of the possible third wave, the paediatric task force issued guidelines and separate wards have been readied for children,” Thakur said. Both RT-PCR and rapid antigen tests would be conducted at the childcare centres to detect Covid cases, the minister said. Feedback on repeated tests would be taken from the women and child welfare department officials posted in the districts, she said. WCD commissioner Rahul More said all steps were being taken to ensure that the children were regularly tested to prevent any spurt in Covid-19 cases, especially in the wake of the possibility of the third wave. He said all collectors and health officials had been told to ensure that medical camps were conducted to ensure adequate testing on symptomatic children, and even staffers, at these centres. “The same was done during the first wave, too. But ahead of the possible third wave and after the experts’ warning about children likely to get affected more, the administration and the health officials would have to be more cautious,” the commissioner said. 50 out of 580 children losing parents to Covid rehabilitated A total of 50 of the 580 children who lost their parents to Covid have been rehabilitated at children’s homes in the state, said the women and child development commissioner, Rahul More. Nearly 19,000 children lost one parent to Covid in Maharashtra, so far. They were being covered under the Bal Sangopan Yojana of the state government. Rs1,100 was being transferred to their accounts each month, said the officer. The state women and child department has been allocated Rs40 crore for rehabilitating children losing parents. The work is on to trace them. 694 homes removed from state list Nearly 694 homes were removed from the list of 1,154 childcare institutions in the state under the new state government rules and the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015. The homes were removed from the list because they did not fit into the criteria. At present, the 460 operational homes can cater to 24,000 children. As of now 10,000 children are housed at these institutions.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/regular-covid-tests-must-at-childcare-institutions-wcd-minister/articleshow/86051100.cms||Nisha Nambiar

A senior official in the home department said three dreaded criminals had also been killed in encounters with the police in the last one year. “Properties of as many as 12 criminals have been attached and stringent provisions of the National Security Act and the Gangster Act have been invoked against 25 and 567 accused persons, respectively,” he said. Another officer said because of the sustained efforts of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, UP emerged successful in not just curbing crimes but also in instilling a sense of security among people. Police have so far seized illegal assets and properties of criminals, worth about Rs 2.5 billion, since 2017 March. ADG, law and order, Prashant Kumar said in another move to prevent crime, the history sheets of as many as 382 criminals involved in offences were opened out of which 274 accused were arrested and sent to jail. “To improve law and order, prompt and strict action is also being taken through micro-planning to instill a sense of fear among criminals in every corner of the state,” he said. “To rein in habitual criminals, police have taken action under against 233 criminals under the Goonda Act, while 11 arms licenses were cancelled in last one year,” said the officer.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/800-habitual-offenders-identified-8k-cases-filed/articleshow/86052287.cms||---

Andhra Pradesh has been witnessing a strange climate phenomenon over the last few years – rainfall in a few heavy bursts and longer dry spells in between. This is despite the mean rainfall remaining in the same range. The inconsistent monsoon phenomenon carries many disturbing implications, including upsetting the prospects of farmers, depleting the groundwater levels, water crisis, lowered food produce, and having a negative impact on the ecology and economy too. While the dry spells may affect the growth and produce of the crops, the intense rains will damage the crops. The unpredictable monsoon patterns will also impact water availability in various reservoirs in the state. According to the official statistics, about 25 lakh hectare area was affected due to the droughts between 2016 and 2019 in Andhra Pradesh. According to experts, a variety of factors have been distorting the pressure belts during monsoons, including increasing temperatures, greenhouse gas emissions, rising sea levels, change in land-use pattern, pollution, etc. Former head of the department of meteorology and oceanography, Prof OSRU Bhanu Kumar, said that there has been a drop in the number of rainy days despite the annual average rainfall remaining more or less the same. “At the same time, there has been an increase in the intensity of wet spells. Even the number of weather systems forming in the sea like lows and depressions has reduced over the years,” said Prof Bhanu Kumar. Director of India Meteorological Department (IMD), Amaravati, S Stella, said that the rainy days vary from year to year based on the climatic patterns and weather systems. “There has been an excess of rainfall in the last two years. But, in general, the intense precipitation events have increased. The heavy rains would only lead more water runoff than the precipitation into the soil,” said Stella. According to agricultural officials, the distribution of rainfall over the months also counts in addition to the overall rainfall as far as agricultural output is concerned.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/inconsistent-monsoon-takes-toll-on-ap-economy-ecology/articleshow/86051095.cms||Umamaheswara Rao

A JAC official said, “The special exam was conducted in the same pattern as the Class IX and XI exams in order to maintain parity.” Earlier this year, JAC had declared the general results of classes X and XII on the basis of Class IX and Class XI exams since offline exams couldn’t be held because of the pandemic. The JAC official said as per the Covid guidelines, the duration of each subject was reduced and several subjects were clubbed in a single session. Around 9,000 students had applied for the examination. A significant number of students, however, did not appear in the examination centre at Zila School Ranchi. School principal Deepa Choudhary said that out of 50 students allotted for the centre, 11 were absent. Choudhary said, “With number of students being low, the Covid safety norms like thermal scanning, maintaining social distancing, could be followed easily.” JAC said that the report on the exact number of absentees would take some days to arrive from the centres. The council’s special examination for intermediate students would be held from September 9 to September 12.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/jacs-special-two-day-class-x-exam-concludes/articleshow/86047996.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क

A division bench of Chief Justice Ravi Ranjan and Justice Sujit Narayan Prasad set a deadline of two months for the government to finalise and make the appointments. The court was hearing a public interest litigation filed by the Bachpan Bachao Andolan, a non-government organisation working for child rights in the state. The court was apprised of the fact that the child welfare committees and the juvenile justice boards are going through a staff crunch which is affecting the cases of juveniles. The committee and the boards are working with officials who have been given extra responsibility to look after the work. The bench in an oral observation said officials put on additional charge will not be able to discharge their duties as is expected of them and will always be in stress which will affect their work. The court said the pending appointments should be made at the earliest. The appointments will affect the rights of the children which cannot go unprotected, the bench observed.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/hc-tells-govt-to-fill-up-posts-in-cwc-and-juvenile-boards/articleshow/86047904.cms||टाइम्स न्यूज़ नेटवर्क
---||Ranchi||BJP stages protest inside, outside assembly over namaz room row||Ranchi: After disrupting proceedings of the ongoing monsoon session for the third consecutive day over the namaz room row, opposition BJP on Wednesday staged a massive protest march on the streets of the capital city. The protestors under the leadership of state party president Deepak Prakash and other senior leaders tried to breach barricades put up by police in order to reach the assembly building. Thereafter, cops resorted to lathi-charge and used water cannons to control the agitators. Saffron party workers at the Argora ground in the afternoon took out a procession and attempted to gherao the assembly building. Apart from Prakash, former CM Raghubar Das, Ranchi MP Sanjay Seth and former Union minister Sudarshan Bhagat, among others, participated in the procession. Babulal Marandi and other BJP MLAs, who were in the assembly, also joined the protesters. Das, Prakash and MP Bidyut Baran Mahto reached the assembly premises and sat on a dharna protesting against police exigency and demanding immediate recall of the notification allotting room in the assembly to offer namaz. “I had written a letter to the Speaker two days ago, asking him to recall the notification. In the same letter, I had mentioned that if he failed to do so, I would go on a hunger strike,” Das said. Marandi also criticised the government for attacking BJP workers, including women. He said that the ‘peaceful’ protestors were trying to go to the Vidhan Sabha and handover a memorandum to the Speaker asking him to withdraw the notification. “We don’t want any temple to be built within the temple of democracy but the government should not allow such unconstitutional things to appease the members of one community,” he said. While Marandi continued to sit on a dharna within the assembly campus, the legislators were informed about the lathi-charge incidence by senior BJP member Neelkanth Singh Munda. Soon after, Bhanu Pratap Singh climbed atop the reporters table and created a ruckus. Other BJP members also joined him in the well and raised slogans seeking resignation of the chief minister for using police against the agitators. The BJP leaders have decided to call a statewide bandh to protest the police action but a final decision was pending. Senior leaders of the party went to HEC Paras hospital to meet the injured. Marandi accused police personnel of charging at him. “I was saved by my bodyguard,” he told media persons.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/bjp-stages-protest-inside-outside-assembly-over-namaz-room-row/articleshow/86048916.cms||Jaideep Deogharia
---||Ranchi||Govt keeps mum on temples’ reopening||Ranchi: Jharkhand government’s disaster management authority (SDMA) on Wednesday refrained from taking a decision on reopening the state’s temples for devotees and opted to wait for Supreme Court’s ruling on a PIL which was filed by members of Panda Dharma Rakshini Sabha, the body of priests of Baidyanath Dham temple in Deoghar. “At the SDMA meet, state disaster management secretary Amitabh Kaushal apprised the chief minister that the Supreme Court’s decision on the reopening of Baidyanath Dham temple has appeared in some newspapers. It was decided that the disaster management wing must work out its further orders on reopening of the temple after studying the Supreme Court’s order. The SDMA will meet next after a copy of the judgment is received,” a statement issued by Soren’s office read. The Panda Dharm Rakshini Sabha had in July moved the apex court and sought its intervention in reopening the Baidyanath Dham temple for devotees for keeping the historic traditions of offering water to the resident deity intact. On Tuesday, the apex court refused an urgent hearing plea on the matter. Meanwhile, Deoghar MLA Narayan Das on Wednesday sat on an indefinite hunger strike at the assembly seeking opening of Babadham temple. He was persuaded to return to house by the speaker. Answering his demand, Soren said that his government was concerned about the panda and the priests but would like to take a decision on reopening the temple after consulting experts. “We all know why schools, colleges, temples and all such religious places were closed. We had to remain confined to our homes because of the pandemic but gradually we are returning to normalcy. Be patient and we would take a decision soon,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/govt-keeps-mum-on-temples-reopening/articleshow/86049043.cms||Dhritiman Ray
---||Ranchi||Cov violation lens on political parties||Ranchi: The Ranchi district administration and the state disaster management department seemed to develop a strong weakness in the knees whenever political gatherings and rallies took place amid fears of a third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. Experts said clear cut rules are in place to prevent such crowding of public places and take action against the violators so they such incidents are not super spreaders or ignition points of the predicted third wave. Expressing displeasure over the recent political congregations, public health expert and assistant professor of community medicine at Rims, Dr Dewesh Kumar said, “These crowded events will only speed up the transmission as people will take the infection back to their respective houses. The administration must understand that such events have to be avoided at any cost.” He added, “Even if people are vaccinated, taking part in such events do not make them immune as the vaccine only reduces the severity of infection.” In recent times, both ruling and opposition parties have violated the norms by taking out serpentine rallies or organising crowded meetings without permission, but the authorities have remained a mute spectator so far. When confronted with the punitive actions they have decided, the authorities meekly responded saying they are looking into it. On Wednesday, opposition BJP took out a massive rally in which thousands of party workers marched towards the state assembly from the Harmu area to Dhurwa. The rally not only threw the traffic on the busy stretch of the Birsa Munda Rajpath out of gear, but not one participant followed the Covid-safety norms, be it social distancing or wearing of masks. A similar rally was also witnessed on August 28 when newly elected state Congress president Rajesh Thakur and office bearers of the party unit were welcomed by thousands of party workers upon their arrival at the city airport from New Delhi. The Ranchi district administration had then said no permission was taken by Congress for the congregation and they were investigating the footage to take appropriate action against the violators. As of Wednesday, two weeks after the incident, action is still awaited. Reacting to BJP’s rally on Wednesday, Ranchi SDM Deepak Kumar Dubey said, “No permission was taken for the march. Thousands of BJP workers broke down our barricades which were installed 50 metres away from the assembly and near the Jagannath temple. Even after repeated warnings, the BJP workers did not stop and we had to use water cannons and mild force to disperse them. The prohibitory orders are on in the 750-metre radius from the state assembly since September 3 because of the monsoon session.” On the rampant violation of the Covid-19 protocols issued by the state disaster management department by the political parties, Dubey said, “We had deployed two videographers and photographers at the barricades. During the whole stretch, two executive magistrates were escorting the illegal march. We are in process of identifying people after which appropriate action will be taken.” He also said they are still investigating the August 28 incident of Congress when the party workers crowded at the airport and carried out rallies in the city.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cov-violation-lens-on-political-parties/articleshow/86047958.cms||Gaurav Pandey

In fact, she was among the first in nursing staff at Central Gujarat’s biggest hospital — SSG Hospital — in Vadodara to handle a Covid-19 positive mother and her newborn when almost everyone feared the deadly virus. Two years ago, when most wards were heavily waterlogged, she along with resident doctors and support staff ensured that the gynaecology and obstetrics department continued to function. On September 15, her dedication to the profession will be recognized as President Ramnath Kovind will confer the prestigious National Florence Nightingale Award 2020 virtual on Bhanumati Gheewala fondly called sister Bhanuben. The Indian Nursing Council, a statutory body under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, confers the award to recognize the contribution of healthcare workers. The 56-year-old head nurse performs her duty six days a week at the government hospital and on the seventh day she provides her voluntary services at Ramkrishna Mission to support their child welfare activities. Bhanuben who joined as a nurse in 1988 underwent training in gynaecology speciality at Chandigarh in 2000 and finished Nurse Practitioner Midwives course in 2010. She also kept upgrading herself. “For years, we had been following conventional methods. It was after a workshop on alternative birth positions in July 2019 that we started practicing birth positions featuring reclining, squatting or side-lying which have physiological and psychological advantages over the conventional posture,” said Bhanuben. “It is indeed a matter of pride for entire SSG Hospital that our nursing staff Bhanuben has been selected for this prestigious award,” said professor Ranjan Aiyer, medical superintendent at SSG Hospital.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vadodara/ssg-nurse-to-be-conferred-florence-nightingale-award/articleshow/86046622.cms||---

It continues to be one of the most trusted and credible mediums that help influence brand perceptions. And this is the resurgence story of print in India,” said Sanchita Roy, head of strategy, Havas Media Group India, which conducted the survey. The survey found that among regular readers, the time spent on reading newspapers increased significantly during the pandemic, especially in the 41-50 year age group. It also showed that consumer expectations from newspapers continue to grow in terms of content and that this is not just limited to news. Gaining more knowledge, staying updated about current affairs and improving language skills remain some of the top reasons for reading newspapers. Content related to science and technology, global affairs and health remained some of the preferred and most-read sections following general news. Given the trust reposed in the print audience, it comes as no surprise that a category-wise deep dive on the effectiveness of the medium for advertisers and marketers revealed that print plays a key role in influencing brand perception, from quality to price to trust. The survey highlighted that consumers paid higher attention to advertisements in newspapers, and only 10% skipped them. For the automobiles segment, for instance, print was found to be the most effective, driving brand awareness of nearly 55% for those intending to purchase their first car. For repeat buyers too, print helped drive brand preference across the funnel. Car advertisements were the second most recalled after mobile phones (higher among repeat intenders). Print also continues to be the preferred source of medium to drive efficacy for categories like smartphones, finance, and education. “In a digital world, when you have a plethora of choices, credibility and trust become two very important pillars for any selection. And print has time and again proved its credibility because of the rigour and systems of checks that are in place,” said Sivakumar Sundaram, chairman of the Executive Committee at BCCL, which publishes TOI. Even in the recent past, digital giants like Google and Facebook have run campaigns in print media when they wanted to build credibility and trust. The research involved stratified random sampling from YouGov’s proprietary panel, which consists of 200,000 active panelists in India, aged between 21-50 years, male and female with a current subscription to at least one daily newspaper, spread across 14 key cities. In the south, nearly 60% readers sought print as a medium to gain more knowledge while in the west, around 33% read newspapers to find local news.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/print-highly-trusted-by-readers-effective-platform-for-marketers/articleshow/86049710.cms||---
---||Ranchi||CM’s call to oppn: Join us to meet PM on caste-based census demand||Ranchi: Chief minister Hemant Soren on Wednesday welcomed opposition members to join an all-party delegation to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi to demand a caste-based census. He said a letter has already been sent to the PMO seeking an audience for a nine-member delegation on any suitable date between September 12 and 20. He was replying to opposition members during question hour on the fourth day of the ongoing monsoon session. Though no specific question related to caste census or reservation was listed, opposition members have been cornering the government over its employment policy, locals’ policy and its stand over reservation to candidates of other backward castes (OBC). It was during first half of the House session that Sudivya Kumar of the JMM sought a consensus of the House for sending a unanimous representation to the Centre for a caste-based census. “Jharkhand Assembly was among the first few states to pass a resolution demanding separate religious code for the the tribals in the census and a similar representation should be sent to Centre for caste census,” he suggested. Once again, opposition members, too, reiterated that the state was not coming clean on its stand in terms of reservation for locals in absence of a definition of who are the local people. Navin Jaiswal of the BJP, instead of asking his listed question, sought a reply from the government about its stand in the matter of OBC reservation. In his reply, Soren informed the House that his government was committed to reservation of OBCs, moolvasis and Adivasis. “We are committed to give reservation in employment and it has been extended even for the private sector but for that we must know the caste composition,” he said, announcing the meeting with an all-party delegation. “A letter has been sent to the PMO and I would request the opposition members to join,” he said. Ajsu Party’s Sudesh Mahto accused the government of not being clear in terms of its agenda for meeting the PM. Mahto said that extending reservation to OBCs is a state subject and so is defining locals but it seems that the CM wants to meet Modi over caste census for which we all are ready,” he said. While announcing to lead a delegation to the Centre for demanding a caste-based census, Soren accused the BJP for not working in favour of poor, Dalit, minorities and tribals during the last 20 years of its rule in the state. “You need not worry about employment policy and locals’ policy as we are committed to introduce them one by one. As of now decks have been cleared for giving reserving 75% vacant seats in the private sector for all jobs with a salary of Rs 40,000 per month as the select committee has submitted its report,” he said.||http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ranchi/cms-call-to-oppn-join-us-to-meet-pm-on-caste-based-census-demand/articleshow/86049000.cms||Jaideep Deogharia
